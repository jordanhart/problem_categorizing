Clough \"pclough\"", "ReviewID": "R2D16C9Y3YFNC4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Important note - I am almost exclusively a Windows user, bear that in mind if you read the following...I must confess, I spent an inordinate amount of time researching this notebook since I had very specific needs and all the 'Geniuses' (Genii?) at the Apple store were clueless. When I explained my needs, I was met with blank stares or flat out told that what I needed was impossible.I am primarily a Windows user (95%+), I have a Mac Pro desktop at the office and I only boot that up to OS X when I need to sync my iPod to iTunes (which I refuse to install on my Windows partition -Terrible piece of software).I also need to encrypt the Windows partition since I run a security company and cannot risk data getting into the wrong hands. Encrypting the Windows partition necessitates Windows being installed on the first partition of the drive which in turn necessitates that I erase all partitions on the drive before I even use the computer, install Windows first partition (without Boot Camp) and then reinstall Mountain Lion back on the second partition.Apple certainly do not make things easy for Windows users which is strange since I think their decision to switch to Intel chipsets was, in part, so they could woo Windows users over to their hardware (in addition to other reasons).Anyway, all of this turned out to be surprisingly painless comparatively so no complaints there since I originally thought it may not be possible.Some of the reasons I ended up buying it...Try running up the same specifications on the Dell, Lenovo or HP web sites, Believe it or not, a notebook with the same specifications, if they can even make it turns out be more expensive. The MacBook Pro retina is actually a good deal!While you are at it, run up the retina MBP specs with the non-retina MBPs, you will find they are about $300 more too (Weird!)Apple hardware is very good in my experience. I paid about twice as much for my Mac Pro desktop than I used to pay for my other major brands and it has been working flawlessly for almost three years now with no replacement parts needed and no reinstalling of Windows needed.Also I thought 'what the hell...), I was done researching and up for a challenge.Some things I was surprised to find out that I did not turn up in my pre-purchase research...You cannot boot this machine off an external CD (even the Apple Superdrive), you need to make bootable USB thumb drives if you want to install Windows or OS X onto a blank drive - Not a deal breaker for most people.Thunderbolt is not hot swappable under Windows - This machine has no Ethernet jack (I knew that) so you need the Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter to get a gigabit Ethernet connection, what I did not know was that I would have to reboot Windows every time I want to plug into a network. Bummer.And the biggie which no-one else has mentioned while they drool over the display's attributes - It is 20% dimmer than a non-retina display (under both Windows and OS X) Don't believe me? Google it. I originally thought it was defective and was going to take it to the Apple Store until I discovered this. Apparently the 4 times higher pixel density requires a lot more power to get the same brightness (400 cd/m2 compared to 340 cd/m2) so they limited the screen brightness to get better battery life.Anyway, all in all, I am happy with it and glad I bought it.I have also discovered a side effect that I find myself booting up to OS X more just to play with it (I am typing this on it right now) since, with the SSD, it is very quick to change from one OS to the other. I will still always be a Windows man though since I exclusively use Windows-only applications.New Discovery - When you use the Thunderbolt to Ethernet adapter under Windows, it prevents Sleep Mode. i.e. when the Thunderbolt adapter is being used and you close the lid, the whole computer shuts down requiring a full reboot. The issue took hours of my time to identify until I put two and two together. When you add this to the fact that you cannot hot swap the Ethernet adapter - If you need a wired Ethernet connection regularly, this is a major problem.", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Still the best you can get for your money", "Author": "gr3atwhit3", "ReviewID": "R1JAK77UTPZ8W2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although expensive, you Do get what you pay for.  I've had my 2.6GHz, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD (ordered through Apple) for about a month.  I do have the LG screen, and have not had any issues with image retention (IR).  I do use the machine for hours, displaying the browser or editing window in the same spot, no issues with IR.Regardless of the screen, which has simply amazing clarity (compare the retina model directly next to another, ...you will see even more of a difference!), the machine is a powerhouse for such a portable laptop.  Now I can quickly encode video on my laptop instead of always using my desktop (I could do it before on my 17\" MBP, but the time it took was not practical).  This is all thanks to the quad core i7 of course.I recommend the 16GB of RAM if you do any virtualization, which I believe almost anyone will end up getting involved in now.  I have win 7 installed through bootcamp, and get a 7.4 score for the windows experience, and it runs windows better than all my PCs...Overall, as a heavy user (running a couple VM's, office apps, browsers, iTunes, FaceTime, iPhoto, etc; all at once), this machine rocks!  It doesn't help me manage my OCD, b/c it allows me to do everything at once!! lol  If you are on the fence about the purchase, I highly recommend it.  I've worked on Macs for over a decade, and this one doesn't let down.  If you do end up with issues with the screen or whatever, just be persistent with Apple customer service until the problem is resolved, it IS worth it  (I know, it sucks to deal with that, but even Ferrari's have problems!!)", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best laptop on the market", "Author": "rbtk", "ReviewID": "R3J4AOJ0W5A7S2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Macbook pros are always held to a higher standard, because of their reputation and cost. The level of scrutiny we give these products is generally higher than that given comparable windows machines. First things, first - the cost of this machine, given it's SSD, pixel density, processor and build quality is about right. A similarly equipped Windows machine of a professional build is not going to be substantially cheaper.The screen is excellent. My particular machine has a samsung screen - I had a 2.3/245GB model that I exchanged out for the 2.6/512GB due to my need for a larger HD. That previous computer had an LG screen, so I can compare the two. The Samsung uses a PLS display, as opposed to LG's IPS display. The Samsung's screen has a brighter screen and no reported incidences of image retention. I never saw any image retention on my LG, but the color uniformity was not as good as the Samsung. There was an almost imperceptible yellow cast on the L side of the screen. IPS panels are notorious for this and it's luck of the draw if you get one. Luckily, Apple has incredible customer service and will readily accept returns (as does Amazon). In any event, my current MBP screen is perfect - with true white, deep color, excellent contrast and perfect uniformity and pixels. To check out your panel use this command in terminal:ioreg -lw0 | grep \\\"EDID\\\" | sed \"/[^<]*</s///\" | xxd -p -r | strings -6LSN=Samsung, LP=LG when the results return.The computer is very fast  - the SSD is quick in real world use, though I haven't run a benchmark on it. Boot times are within seconds and application load times are virtually instantaneous. Retina compatibility is growing, so app support hasn't been an issue. Performance wise, I don't have many complaints. I have noticed that the Safari browser doesn't run facebook as smoothly, unless you are running the adblock extension. That's probably the only negative I've been able to pick up so far (and it's a trivial issue). Chrome support for retina resolution exists, but it doesn't take advantage of the MBP's horsepower - the speed is suboptimal compared to Safari. The pixel density really pushes the graphics capability of this machine to it's limits. If the software is not optimized - you will know it.Compared to my HP Elitebook 8560w (which is an excellent Windows laptop), the MBP is just faster, better built with superior display, better browser performance and vastly better trackpad. It's simply a better experience, overall, for a comparably priced computer. It's a clear step up from my previous Macbook.Highly recommended.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Apple - An American Champion", "Author": "R. Williams", "ReviewID": "RCEF009X2OQWW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In my opinion, this is the finest computer ever built - it is simply extraordinary.After going through the initial setup and messing around for a few minutes, I felt as giddy as I did when I first experienced the 3G iPhone, 27\" iMac, iPhone 4, iPad, and iPad 3... another step forward.Every little detail is accounted for.  The case is gorgeous with not a blemish or burr to be found - extremely precision.  It feels very sturdy, too; no flex.  The chiclet keys do not compress quite as deeply as past keyboards and the scalloped area they sit in is not as deep (as past MBPs) either.This computer is extremely snappy, virtually instant-on, both boot-up and wake times.  The solid-state HDD makes all the difference, combined with 8GB of ram - everything feels like it happens instantly.The trackpad feels perfect - easily the best pad in the industry.  The click is just right, and gesturing is buttery-smooth.The sound really is impressive for a laptop, and such a thin one at that.  Great voice clarity.And of course I'll save the best for last - the Retina display is game-changing.  I'm a visual learner so this means everything to me.  It reminds me of the first time I started watching HD programming, then seeing the amazing resolution on the 27\" iMacs, and then the Retina displays on the iPhone 4 and iPad 3 - except that it trumps all of those.  The clarity just leaves you awestruck.  The overall experience is breathtaking.I've read all the formal reviews and was aware of the potential scroll lag/frame rate issue on certain web pages at the highest resolution raised by Anantech (which is about the only complaint I've heard besides the price tag and lack of upgradability) - and I absolutely wouldn't let it deter you.  Out of the box, it feels great even with Lion.  Further, you can see videos on youtube of people running Mountain Lion that say any of the aforementioned minuscule issues have been smoothed out.  I would also add that everything is very tiny at the highest resolution to begin with, so using the classic scaled sizes will probably be the preference of most users (which still benefit immensely (4x sharper) from the Retina display).  It will take awhile for all apps/browsers/etc to be Retina optimized, but such is the cost of being first with the latest technology.Regarding upgradability, everybody knows that the components are hardwired this time and the battery is glued in - to me, it's as simple as ordering what you need up front.  I chose the base model for several reasons:  a lot can be backed up in the cloud including your matched music (which at $25/year is a great deal), a 1 TB portable drive (about the size of a wallet) is around $100 if I really need to bring a ton of content somewhere, and this being the first version, I'm sure there will be improvements in subsequent models, at which point I may sell this and upgrade.Lastly, I wanted to mention that the packaging by Amazon was first-rate.  The white rMBP box came packed in another box with robust cardboard corner inserts that capped each corner (of the white rMBP box).  Then that box was packed in yet another box, with air packs filling the small gap.  The white rMBP box was in pristine condition with perfect corners.

After much use, I can say it blows my other Mac (2008 Aluminum Unibody Macbook) out of the water.  Not just because of the massive processor upgrade, but also, the graphics are incredible.  Another nice surprise was the outstanding sound quality.  I video recorded the fireworks on the 4th in full hd, then made a full project in iMovie.  That was more than sufficient to create an outstanding home video.  To test the graphics, I used pictures from a Leica D-Lux 5 as well as Sony NEX-3 using the traditional 18-55mm lens.  The picture quality is outstanding and I can zoom in well past 200% before I start losing picture quality of landscapes.  The video is in one word, amazing.  I have an Asus external blu-ray/dvd drive, that I connected to watch Avatar via Aurora.  Apple in no way stretched the truth, when they bragged about the graphics.  Write and transfer times are very fast.  Don't ask me how fast because I haven't been able to test it graphically.  I can tell you that it took me less than two minutes to import more than 2000 pictures into Aperture from my Xtreme 2.0 flash drive.  It's easier than ever to set up a Mac, apps can be installed through the App store, music downloaded from iTunes Match in the Cloud, and everything else (mail, address book, calendar) automatically syncs with your apple id.  I sent my grandma an iPad to chat with the kids because it's user friendly, and this computer is no exception to that rule.  I love that launch pad can be organized with folders to place apps wherever you want them to go.This computer rocks and I'll break it down like this:If you have an android phone and are a casual laptop user, get a pc, it'll work better with your apps and transitioning data.If you have iOS devices (iPad, iPhone, iPod touch) and you utilize a computer for business as well as intensive media, get this computer.

The screen does take alot of energy to run, and that fact they even managed 7 hours of batter life into this gorgeous machine despite the other hardware is Very impressive!Now the other hardware, the new chipsets they have installed run cooler and can still excel in all modern applications, and should for the next few years, with a trubo boost of in the upper 3GHz range, you might as well buckle in for a long term relationship cause you will not need a faster CPU than this for some time.The Video card is also a Major bonus, the degree of technology they have invested in this area if commendable, you can run the most demanding games in relative ease, all in such a small package with such a beautiful display, its like peanut better meets jam all over again.

The lifespan of this machine is much more efficient because of this super fast interaction between the already high powered CPU and Graphics, its a no brainer and certainly an Major step in the direction of producing Faster more Efficient machines.And all that crap about ethernet and not CD drives, thats just amature.

Let's run over the main features.1. RETINA DISPLAY. If your eyesight is such that you run even standard laptops at non-native resolutions \"to make the letters bigger\", don't waste your money on this. If, on the other hand, print on standard-resolution laptops looks insufferably blurry/smudgy to you and hardcopy at the same size doesn't, the retina display will be a delight. (Same consideration applies to the New iPad vs. the iPad 2.) The extra resolution in rendering fonts, BTW, greatly helps the eye: while my previous laptop was an MBP with the \"hi-res\" 1680x1050 option, I can fairly comfortably run this one (same screen size) at 1920x1200, and on occasion (when I really need the screen real estate) even run it at full native resolution (2880x1800). A 3rd-party utility named SwitchResX is very helpful in this.Incidentally, a fringe benefit is that this machine now actually has an IPS panel like the iPads and the iPhones --- all of Apple's older laptops use TN panels of different qualities. The difference in usable viewing angle, especially, is dramatic. The \"native\" HiDPI virtual resolution is 1440x900: other HiDPI resolutions are handled by rendering at 2x the resolution in the GPU, then downsampling to 2880x1800 (the physical resolution).The basic idea of \"HiDPI\" resolutions is simple: double the resolution of the panel, then render all fonts, icons, interface elements,... at twice the dpi (four times the pixel count) as before. The result is the same physical size image as before, but dramatically sharpened. Newer applications (particularly anything written in CoCoa, Apple's newer development environment) support this out of the box. Some older apps (notably Office 2011) do not, and those render as if the resolution were just 1440x900, 1680x1050, ... WITHOUT HiDPI. A little utility called Retinizer [...] proved very helpful with that, at least with Office 2011. Adobe CS will supposedly soon come out in retina-savvy versions.2a. FORM FACTOR. This is of course a heavier machine than a Macbook Air, and it will be difficult to use on an airplane seat in economy class (although the readability of the display under unorthodox viewing angles helps). In return, you get not just the display but a quad-core CPU and a GPU that can handle all of the above and more. In my office, I have the machine tied to an Apple Cinema Display 27\" in video mirroring (it gets letterboxed on the laptop screen): the GPU handles the 2560x1440 screen without even breaking a sweat. If you need all this power, the Retina can be your desktop replacement. If you need a machine for web browsing and presentations, get a Macbook Air 13 instead. If having on-board Ethernet and an optical drive are so important to you, stick with the \"regular\" Pro. (One trade-off for the thin form factor is having to put up with all sorts of small and cute, but easily misplaced, adapter cables. There just is no physical room for the obsolete-but-still-common VGA port, so if you're speaking at conferences, make sure to carry the Thunderbolt to VGA cable and preferably a spare.)2b. CPU power: again, some people need a quad core (I sure do, as will anybody who runs numerical simulations directly on their laptop or otherwise tax their machines), and this machine gives as much power as you can get in thsi form factor, in or out of the Appleverse. But if it's overkill for you, you can easily shave off over 1/3 of the weight by going for an Air 13 and 1/2 by going for an Air 11 instead.3. SSD. THis is an unqualified yes: I had no idea what I/O hogs recent versions of Mac OS X had become, and the performance on an SSD versus a conventional hard drive is just day and night. This isn't just a function of data transfer rates but of the heads on a physical hard drive not being able to be in more than one place at a time: so with multiple concurrent data requests, performance of a single HD drops like a stone while that of an SSD doesn't. The flip side, of course, is that SSDs are (for now) much more expensive per GB. My machine was paid for by work so no complaints there.4. OS. My machine came with Mountain Lion (10.8) and I upgraded it to 10.8.1 on the spot. A lovely enough OS, but if you are dependent on older programs requiring Rosetta (the PowerPC emulator), you need Snow Leopard (10.6.x) or earlier, and nothing below (I think) 10.7.4 (Lion) will run on this. For those preferring Windows (emphatically not me!) I am told that both Windows 7 and the prerelease Windows 8 install on this.5. Fan noise, battery life: seriously, best I've ever seen in any real laptop. Still I keep a vigilant eye on \"Activity Monitor\" for stuck processes (when you're as \"abusive\" a computer user as I am, this is simple prudence). But, considering the behavior of modern Intel CPUs (google \"TurboBoost\"), power consumption will go up dramatically when CPUs are stretched to the limit, and batteries will be run down quickly, so one recipe for battery autonomy is to leave yourself enough performance headroom.6. Minor things:Speakers are much improved over any Apple model. Then again, for this price... On the third hand, there's a limit to what can be done in such a form factor. Few people would be willing to carry around a laptop sized for near-HiFI speakers.Keyboard is comfortable enough. Speech-to-text is still not an alternative for me.7. Upgradability. Basically, nonexistent, which is why I bought mine in maxed-out configuration. In particular, since software becomes ever more of a memory hog, I would strongly recommend going for as much RAM as you can afford on purchase, unless you know beforehand that you won't be taxing the machine (if, say, you're a professional writer who likes the Retina display but otherwise just runs Storyboard or Scrivener and a web browser).\\8. Ruggedness. There are essentially no moving parts in this computer and construction does feel solid, but I still treat it with more  physical care than I have treated past computers, in part owing to its high cost (even though it wasn't my own money).One tip if you own a New iPad as well (I do): check out Air Display, which allows you to run your iPad as a 2nd monitor (over WiFi), and is now HiDPI-savvy.My overall recommendation: if, based on the above, this is the machine for you (basically: you are a power user and/or have very discriminating eyesight) and you can afford it, you won't regret buying it.

Macbook pro Retina LG displays have many problems with ghosting, color correction, burn in and brightness. I hunted for a Macbook Pro Retina with a Samsung display and my display works perfect, I took no chances. It's brighter with nice native color correction and no ghosting or burn-in problems. I don't know why Apple would use two different manufactures to make the same computer displays, evidently that was a HUGE mistake Apple did. I hope they learned from it and only use Samsung for all their computers now. Samsungs reputation in quality is superior vs LG's, why mess with that.ALL Programs need to be updated for Retina display computers - Yeah they still work on Retina but they look awful. Many major software companies have already updated but many are still not. Programs that are not updated for Retina look pixely and worse then the ice aged computer graphics. It will take time before all programs are up to date for Retina but I would think not more then a year since most programs come out with the next version year after year.The internet web images that have too much optimizing to them (most do) look very blurry/fuzzy on HD Retina displays. All web designers will have to update their images and code to accommodate the new HD Computer screens. I am a designer and I have come to reason to just suck it up and do my web images over for HD displays since HD computer displays are our future. This laptop will come in very handy for work to update my web graphics for HD results. The original image has to be 2x the actual size for web images to look as sharp as the text on HD displays, then downsize the image to actual 1x in CSS or HTML inline image dimensions. especially for icons and small images.The battery power is the same as all other laptops. not even 7 hours.No cd/dvd drive but Remote Disc works great! I just connect the Retina to my other computers Cd/Dvd drive wirelessly using the built in Remote Disc. It's neat and amazingly works FAST! for wireless, you can also buy the extra external compact Cd/Dvd drive if you really use a lot of cd's or dvd's on the road.You have to buy an extra adapter to connect Firerwire to Thunderbolt port. There is no firewire port.So they say the Ram will never be upgradable and/or Apple has to do it if it does become available to upgrade it, but who knows what the cleaver DIY people will come up with in the future for parts. They always come up with something to fix and upgrade yourself... I still say if Apple can fix and upgrade, then eventually with the right parts made and instructions, so can we. It's too soon to tell.  I am not worried about this because this little machine kicks butt and is SUPER FAST! regardless of specs the Flash drive is FAST! and you can really push it beyond with no problems. I have tested using photoshop, dreamweaver, illustrator, final cut pro and firefox all open at once going back and forth, it has no problems at all with 8 GB ram. It just depends on what you are going to do in the programs and on how far you can push it rather you would need more ram or not, but It seems GREAT so far.EDIT 01/16/2013: I had people asking me how to tell the difference between a LG or Samsung Display before they buy and they also asked me how did I find it with a Samsung display. I thought I would put my information here as well to help others out...This is how I determine the make of the Retina display. In applications under utilities is an application called Terminal. You can use Spotlight to quickly search and find Terminal. After you open Terminal copy and paste this code in it and hit enter.Note: This code only works for the 15\" MacBook Pro Retina NOT the 13\" .I don't know what code they use for the 13\" MacBook Pro Retina to find out, you will have to search the internet for 13\" code.ioreg -lw0 | grep \\\"EDID\\\" | sed \"/[^<]*</s///\" | xxd -p -r | strings -6This code will bring up the display part number. The first number right after \"Color LCD\" is the part number. Mine says LSN154YL01001.The way to tell is... if LS is at the beginning of the part number then it's a Samsung display if LP is at the beginning of the part number then it's a LG Display.I found this information on Tuaw. Amazon doesn't let you put links here but if you search \"Tuaw Retina Samsung\" in Google the first website will come up with the information titled \"Are Retina MacBooks displaying screen issues?\".When you go to the Apple store explain your concerns and that you are only looking for the MacBook Pro Retina with a Samsung display in it Not the LG display. Apple has no way of telling this without opening the box (so they say). They will let you exchange it until you find the right display BUT you have to buy the first one to check it. You can check it right at the Apple store. Open the laptop, go to the internet using Safari and look for that Tuaw website, copy the code and paste it in the laptops terminal, then keep your fingers crossed and see what part number comes up. If it is a LP part number = LG display, then tell the Apple sales person you want to exchange it for another one and try one more time. \"Each\" Apple store will let you do an exchange once a day so if you don't get a LS part number = Samsung display after all that then you have to go to the next Apple store and try again. They will let you keep exchanging but you may have to go to the next store or next day to keep doing it. It took me 3 times of exchanging at 3 different Apple Stores before I finally got the Samsung display. It all depends on how determined you are to get it. You may get lucky the very first time.Hint, Only exchange it because if you return it then go buy another one... then your credit card will take 4-6 days to show the return/refund so it's important to just keep exchanging it till you get the Samsung. If you give up and no longer want to try then just Return it within 14 days.If after trying 3 times I was seriously thinking I was not going to buy it and just return it but something told me to try one more time. It's true what the say... things happen when you least expect it, because the last time I was willing to try...VOILA! it was a Samsung part number, finally an LS at the beginning of the part number. Even the store manager congratulated me and gave me a high five. I was very excited. It was like winning the lottery!

I will never buy another Dell. So when it came time to get a computer to handle work and play my options were basically between the MBP and Samsung. An informal poll of my friends found that the majority had Apples and that they loved em and they lasted. Those using them in business had few problems in the business world.I obviously went with the Mac after playing with the Samsung. Yes it is more expensive.

It performed great for it's time, I got the components I liked best for it and it stood the test of time up until it just died. I didn't want to have to replace parts at the time so I sold it's working parts and moved on into the world of the Laptop.I owned a series of ASUS, HP and other notebooks for a couple of years, moved on to some more powerful machines as money allowed for it, an Alienware computer for example with all the 'fix-ins' that cost me a pretty penny more than the MacBook Pro with Retina did. Eventually though with all the mechanical issues I had with that machine it was time to say bye-bye and I bought my first Mac.I am not a professional, although I do dabble in photography but my passion is computers, I just love them whether it's the newest technology, design, ease-of-use or whatever else you can think of, I enjoy them - Windows, Mac, Linux, whatever!My first Mac was the 2010 MacBook Air 13.3' (This does negate however that I had a 27'' iMac for a small time that had to be returned due to an issue with the screen.) it lived a strong life since I had bought it, it was a wonderful computer in almost every way except one - I was, maybe it was a bad thing, spoiled by power. My older computers ugly as they were had more horsepower than the my Air did. Now, I loved the Air, it never failed me and Hell it actually did good with somethings. I was never a heavy \"gamer\" and hate the title, but in some dull drums and fits of boredom I'd turn on some games. I actually got that little Air to push as hard as it could and run Grand Theft Auto IV which I bought on Steam for four dollars when it was on sale.But it still wasn't quite enough for me, so paying attention to all the news as I usually do I saw that Apple's conference was coming up and I paid apt attention to what was going on that day and what they were announcing, I did not expect them to announce this computer at all. But when I saw it's attributes, it's features, etc I knew that it was what I'd been waiting for, or at least I hoped so!Two weeks later, I'd sold my Air and worked very hard to find a Best Buy that had it. AND IT WAS HARD, no one had one and I was very lucky to be able to acquire one, I was scared I wouldn't...HANDS-ONLike opening any Apple product it was a lot of fun, that's just how it is... I've never bought a product from another company that made me so happy to both use, open and just to own it.But I doubt most people care about this, it's the operation of the notebook that matters.I purchased the 8GB, 256GB version. I did not need more power or hard drive space, because there was no reason for me to have it - The computer was already a pretty penny shy from $2,500 with tax. So that was the version I went with.An I have no complaints about it at all or regrets it runs faster and smoother than any PC I've had before it both on Windows 7 and Lion and hopefully Mountain Lion as well.The form of the computer has impressed everyone, even my father who raised me on Windows and HATES (I mean with a passion) Macintosh computers. It's thin, light and fascinating.The screen is unbelievable, stunning. People aren't kidding when you say you have to sit down with one to really realize how incredible it is, using it with anything is just a pleasure. Yes there are some compatibility issues because things aren't scaling right. I bet that will change over time and even if it doesn't, things still really look awesome in the classical sense.The hardware is superb and yes, you can not upgrade it but why would you need to? Even the \"Base\" Retina model is more powerful and more ahead of the curve than Windows PCs will be for some time, I would hope and pray this computer will last me as long as my \"favorite\" computer did, four years plus.It does not have an ethernet port, which is a downfall, of course but it has an easily attachable doohickey, if you do actually need it.It's construction is superb, not a wobbly-bit in the whole system, it's just solid, truly solid.I loved my Air but I think, all things considered this is my favorite computer I've ever owned so far and hopefully as Apple rolls out new OS'es it will continue to evolve!Now for one big con...Seeing as this was a surprise announcement from Apple, there are no CASES, NONE!

My last laptop was a Dell Inspiron XPS M1330 Notebook, which I got five years ago and hated within the first week of use. That computer was half the price of this MacBook Pro, and really, the only reason I decided to go all out on this current purchase is because of how much I disliked that Dell Notebook that I ended up having to use since 2007. I was actually quite worried because all I remembered about Apple growing up was how it wasn't compatible with anything. Obivously, lots have changed over the last 15 years, and I've had no problems using this MacBook (the other thing I remember about Apple computers was how they weren't user friendly, which I also haven't had a problem with).So I figured if this computer lasts five years and, because of its hefty price tag, remains in better than average running condition, then I'll be quite happy. I just downloaded two massive games, Batman Arkham Asylum and StarWars Kinght of the Old Republic, both of which needed huge amounts of memory to run, and both of which run as smoothly as if I had them on a game console. This is the kind of computing performance I'm hoping lasts with this admittedly expensive laptop for at least three years, if not the entire length of time I'm hoping to keep it for.My only negatives about the MacBook Pro has been mentioned by other reviewers. It's true, the screen is a bit dim. I didn't know what was up with the StarWars game at first, and started playing it in the dark so that I could see the details better. I guess this has something to do with Retina display, or battery life, or something. I also kind of dislike how right and left click is done with the keyboard touchpad. Maybe I just need to get used to it, but I prefer the two clicks to be separate, and not on the same pad. This becomes especially annoying when playing games. And I miss keys like PageUp/PageDown, and such. The MacBook keyboard layout is still taking me some time to get used to.Overall, though, I'm loving this laptop, which I'm happy about becasue, as I've stated, it costs enough. Of course, the opening price listed here isn't accurate. Once you add everything together like taxes and such, and if you get any upgrades in performace or additonal Apple care protection, you'll be paying almost twice what the price is stated on Amazon and Apple websites.UPDATE 9/3/2012: I wanted to add to my original review that though I still love this MacBook, there are some issues that potential buyers should know. First all, the battery doesn't come close to lasting seven hours, or six hours, and perhaps when you first buy it, you may get five hours. In less than a month, my battery is already lasting between four and five hours. Now, perhaps I run too many programs, and I know gaming definitely drains the battery. But even when I'm just listening to music and using Word, the battery still doesn't get close to seven or six hours.Also, the edges of MacBooks are sharp, and can become quite uncomfortable to somewhat painful on your wrisits. I've gone to different forums on this topic, and I know some people have an issue with this, some don't. I am *definitely* one of those people who do. The previous Sunday, I didn't have much to do so stayed on my computer most of the day, and my wrists are still feeling the effects of the edge of the MacBook cutting into them 24 hours later.Anyway, I won't keep updating this review, I just felt that battery lifespan and painful wrists are serious considerations to anyone thinking of buy a Mac. Despite this, though, the MacBook Pro with Retina Display is really an amazing machine, and I have watched movies to Youtube to streamed videos to games on it, and the visuals are truly amazing.

That was my favorite laptop I'd owned up until that point, but this huge chunk of metal was cumbersome to travel with, the battery life wasn't great, and it would get so hot it would literally burn a hole in my pants. When the 2nd generation MacBook Air was released to rave reviews, I downgraded to the 13\" MBA and while it is lightning fast (boots up in <15 seconds) and is a delight to bring around... I've struggled with the reduced screen real estate. I wound up buying an Apple Thunderbolt Display Monitor (also compatible with the mbpRD) because I found that I just didn't have enough space on the 13\" to work on complex tasks simultaneously. While the massive Display is great, it's not optimal for comfort if you have to do extended reading. Accordingly, I wound up buying the iPad3 and for the last few months I've had all these Apple devices to serve the job that this MacBook Pro with RD accomplishes by it's lonesome. It's ultra powerful when I have to run intensive processes and almost as portable as the MacBook Air. The screen is unbelievable - ads don't do it justice. If you spend 15 minutes looking at the Retina Display and then return to a regular resolution laptop you will think you are going blind. The difference is similar to high definition vs. regular definition on television. The MacBook Pro with Retina Display is truly the best of all these Apple devices rolled into one dynamo.I do understand the concerns of someone considering switching from a machine with a much larger hard drive. I went from a 17\" Macbook pro with a massive hard drive to a 13\" Macbook Air with just 250GB just a few months ago. I quickly realized how much unimportant crud I was accumulating in my computer. By spending a second to decide whether a file is actually something worth holding onto, you develop a much better understanding of exactly what you have on your machine and this has dramatically improved my productivity. With such a massive internal HD, there is also the hidden perils of developing reckless attitudes towards backup your essential data externally. It is an metaphysical certainty that your HD will fail at some point (most will go bad within just a few years) - by appreciating what data is on your machine, your are inherently better prepared to protect your most important files and memories.The notion simply because this device can't be upgraded it is somehow not worth it's price tag  is based on an archaic paradigm of technology. You should not purchase a laptop with the expectation that it will last you more than a few years. The base MBPwRD hardware specifications are so loaded with excess that you would have no reason to upgrade it's internals for the foreseeable future.I could provide a laundry list of Apple policies that have frustrated me and products that have underwhelmed me... but if you have the money to spend and want the best computer experience possible - theres nothing else that's even close.***EDIT***Now that I've been using this for a couple of weeks, I feel compelled to point out a few issues with this laptop that I did not notice when I posted originally.1. Laptop gets very hot if not properly ventilated. I don't even try to bring it outside with me anymore because I'm scared it will melt - it seems to conduct and retain heat in excess to any other laptop I've previously owned.2. The Retina display isn't as perfect as I originally believed. Text is certainly crisp and graphics looks great - but the \"best for retina\" setting does not allow for nearly as much screen real estate as I would like. This did not bother me at first because I would toggle between the \"best for retina\" when I was focusing on a single task like reading and then use one of the optional higher resolutions while multi-tasking. The problem is that in my experience, the resolution settings above the \"best for Retina option\" lead to very poor CPU performance (constant application freezing, slowed responsiveness, etc). This problem only gets worse when you are running several applications at once, which ironically is precisely the reason you would want to choose the higher resolution (so you can multitask with greater productivity).3. The laptop is significantly lighter than it's predecessor, but it is way way heavier than the Macbook Air. MBA converts (like me) should go to the Apple store and pick it up to get an idea of what I mean. When you get used to carrying around a weightless laptop - you really notice when you go back to a heavier item.These complaints aside, this is still an exception computer and I would highly recommend it highly.Hope this helps..", "Date": "June 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best computer I've ever owned.", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "R2K47NNAYXL6F4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this computer the day it came out and ended up returning 3 of them before I got one that wasn't flawed in some way that made spending $3,000 seem like a shame. Apple eventually got me the flawless computer I thought I was getting in the first place. They also made right on my inconvenience by giving me a couple of accessories free of charge. Aside from some bumps in the road here and there customer service was excellent overall.I've had a few months now to make use of this computer and I've slowly grown to like it more and more.This is my first Apple Laptop. Obviously it runs a different OS than the Dell it replaces, OSX, which in my experience so far is a superior computing experience over Windows.Construction:-The laptop is on another level from anything I've owned before. It's incredibly well designed, every corner and curve seem perfectly conceived. It is carved from metal but is somehow soft. It appears soft to the eye in most light and the smooth lightly textured surface has a softness to it. The surface is functionally well considered. It's textured and very slightly grippy as a result, but not sticky the way rubber or plastic are. It's similar to fine grain paper.Touchpad:-The touchpad is superb. It's highly accurate and very easy to use. Again, the surface texture is perfectly defined here. The level of friction is the exact amount needed to allow you to move your finger freely and feel the physical distance your finger travels. Being able to sense the speed, distance, and positioning of your fingers so easily makes performing gestures second nature. I've found that I use gestures all the time even when I use a mouse. One great feature is being able to click and hold to drag an object, and while still holding the touch pad down with one finger, use another finger to continue dragging a file across the screen. This intelligent multi-touch feature is just one example of how Apple has understood human considerations at a finely grained level.Performance:-I have the 2.6ghz model with 16Gb of ram and a 512MB SSD. It is extremely fast. It just flies on everything. Compiling a 10,000+ line application in IntelliJ literally takes just a second. In addition to software development I also use this machine to run Autodesk MAYA, & Adobe Creative Suite 6 with Retina ready Photoshop & Illustrator. It screams on all of the above. Whether you're loading the apps from memory or off the disk, it takes just a second or two to be up and running. Saves happen super fast even on large images or Illustrator files.- Testing on Geekbench shows that this laptop has a higher system score than 2011's iMac, in fact the only computers faster than this computer made by Apple past or present are the new iMac and the Mac Pro.Screen:-The screen is superb but on two of my three exchanged rMBP's the screen had image burn-in issues, your screen should not have this issue, if it does, exchange it.-When it's right, the screen is fantastic. It's not quite as amazing as the retina iPad and iPhone but it's impressive. One thing I love about the iPhone is that you can hold the phone an inch from your eye and it's next to impossible to discern the pixels. The 15\" retina screen has 220 dpi which is about double the non-retina 15\" display but you can still discern pixels when you lean into the screen. Since I do some design work I do lean into the screen to select control points on vector artwork or align graphics in a sheet of sprites. Seeing the pixels here isn't a detraction it's simply not as amazing as it could be.-I installed Modern Warfare 2 to test speed and a 3D game running at retina res (yes it's blazing fast). MW2 can be run at 1920x1080 with max settings, or you can run the game at full retina resolution with no AA . One nifty side-effect of running at retina resolution is that it's not necessary to use anti-aliasing. However, if you're running at less than retina resolution it IS still necessary to use anti-alliasing.Keyboard:-The keyboard is great but I prefer the Classic Macbook's slightly increased key travel. That makes this the second best laptop keyboard I've used. Each key has a solid positive feedback and it's easy to type quickly with minimal mistakes.Battery:-The battery life leaves a little to be desired but is decent for what you get in form factor and performance. Expect to get about 1.5-2 hours if doing 3D gaming non-stop, and expect 4 hours for continuous work tasks (creative suite, compiling/debugging etc). You might just sneak past 6 hours if all you're doing is browsing the web/checking email. Whenever I go mobile I pretty much get 4- 4.5 hours of battery before I have to plug in. In my view it could be better.A couple detractions:-One niggle is that it can be difficult to blindly plug in a USB/Thunderbolt peripheral. I kind of have to drag the plug against the side of the computer in the general vicinity of the receptacle if I don't crane my head over to look at the side of the computer. The problem is that the opening for the USB plug is maybe a millimeter wider and taller than the metal part of the USB plug. The precision on the cutouts for the ports is definitely a case of form over function, but, it is a minor annoyance.-Another annoyance is heat dissipation. The CPU/GPU heat is dissipated into the aluminum uni-body. This means that the area just above F1-F4 gets hot to the touch. After a couple hours of gaming certain keys will also start to get hot. I wouldn't want to game with this computer all the time. It can do it for an hour or so but beyond that heat saturation takes over, like when holding the \"G\" key to throw a grenade and the key itself is uncomfortably hot.Conclusion:-So it's not a perfect computer. But it's reliable, beautiful, functional, blazing fast, just a thoughtfully considered and well executed package that ultimately is the best computer I've ever owned. I'm more productive with this computer, it's enjoyable to use in a way that other computers I have owned are not. If you're willing to spend the money, and will mainly use it for work or general computing functions, I would recommend it above all others. I can't recommend this system for 3D gaming, it just doesn't dissipate the heat well enough to pull that off.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Probably...", "Author": "Sabitbol", "ReviewID": "R1KQOC9OHM5L2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The best computer I have ever used.

I knew that I enjoyed gaming from time-to-time, and even creating videos using iMovie, and the occasional video-encoding, so I knew the power packed in would be plenty for me. But I am not any type of professional, nor am I a filthy rich kid who has been given loads of money. I saved up over the past few months, and I knew I had to pick this.Screen: It's absolutely breathtaking. I mean, it literally is the best screen quality on a laptop that i've ever seen. What else can I say, the thing is scaled to look like 1440X900, but JAM-packed with 4x the number of pixels. Good lord, it's ridiculous.Keyboard & Trackpad: Apple without a doubt makes the best trackpads on the market. Once you become efficient with all the gestures, you can literally control the entire PC with a degree of efficiency that is orders of magnitude better than any Windows based laptop. The keyboard is great too. The only keyboard that I personally think that beats it is the keyboards on ThinkPads, but come on, Lenovo is famous for that.Build: It is very quintessential Apple. And by that I mean the build quality on this thing is outrageously good. Thin, relatively light, and built with such precision and rigidity. Amazing.Gaming: I do think this can be a great gaming machine, but contingent on one thing: that you don't feel the need to crank it up to full retina resolutions. I don't think many full desktop GPU's could handle it, let alone the 650m inside this. Now yes, people, and even I, have played games with it turned on, but truly, you don't notice much difference past 1080p anyways. Now some may disagree, but I really don't see that much difference. So if you turn settings to a reasonable level, with a reasonable resolution, this thing is one of the first \"gaming\" laptops by Apple. Very cool.TLDR verson: Overall this is one hell of a good laptop. Yes, it does cost 2199 starting out. And upgrading is crucial due to the inability to add anything other than aftermarkets SSD's provided by OWC - which are pricey at the moment. But I was looking at similarly specced laptops, and honestly, the 2199 model is actually a good value. The Razer Blade has lower specs in every way, yet costs 2800. So all in all, it's not a terrible deal. It just may not be for everyone. Also, consider AppleCare for this one, parts will be expensive, so having that would be a wise investment. But if it is for you, you're going to be blown away. Best computer I've ever owned.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worthy of the Hype", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R1HHXI4H1DUCXP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think it goes without saying that this new Macbook Pro has so far lived up to the hype it has generated and meets the expectations of those (myself included) who have been waiting over a year since first rumored. Most of the positives go without saying, and with a price tag this high one should expect no less. With this review I'm going to try to highlight more of my criticisms of the design and direction Apple have taken since the pro aspects have been beaten to death for the most part.Love it or hate it, Apple has chosen a new and radical direction for the prosumer laptop at least among their lineup. Much like many other consumer goods these days including cars, Apple has chosen to make their laptops smaller, more compact, less serviceable, more disposable and less versatile. In the end it's all a trade off, but Apple chose thinner and lighter at the expense of less external ports, an optical drive and even less noticeable things like the traditional battery LED indicators or sleep indicator light. If you compare professional level PCs to these new MacBooks you will notice that they are all about versatility; they have every port imaginable, an optical drive including blu ray, and are often designed to be upgraded in the future at the expensive of being larger and bulkier. Personally I don't care about most of this stuff and since Apple finally put an HDMI port on this the only port I will be missing is Firewire 800, but they should be releasing a Thunderbolt adaptor for that soon. It is ultimately up to you if this new trend is worthy of your hard earned money, but most of us will not miss optical drives, traditional hard drives or useless ports that require a thicker case (Gigabit ethernet).There are two things that I would like to mention that I don't like about the design of this new MBP. The first is the new MagSafe connector, where not only is it annoying that I can't use all my other chargers (unless I buy an adapter), but it disconnects even easier than the old one and while sitting on your lap it likes to get disconnected. Part of it is a weaker magnet compared to the old connector, but it is also closer to the corner making it easer to get knocked off. It's hard to describe, but if you get one it will probably aggravate you. The second annoyance is how sharp the milling is for the thumb indent to open it. I don't recall the unibody MBPs having corners this sharp, but it can be aggravating while using the trackpad and looks to be a form over function decision (I think it's funny how this artistic design just oscillates between sharp and rounded edges). Another thing some might consider a negative is the transition from a regular display to the retina. When you first start using the new MBP you will notice that it indeed looks nicer, as was the first time you saw programming in HDTV. The bad thing is that if you transition back to using a traditional display the difference is far more pronounced and will look blurry by comparison.A lot of people also like to point out the fact that most mac programs aren't yet optimized for the retina display and don't look so good. This really depends on what you plan on using but it seems to vary on how bearable older programs are to use. I can tell you that with the programs that I currently use Lightroom and Aperture look fine with Photoshop CS5 looking slightly worse but still tolerable. The program I use that looks the worst though is Mathematica 8, and where you can expect companies like Adobe to come out with updates quickly, I wouldn't hold my breath for a company like Wolfram or other smaller companies that will take their time. All of the most used apps look great however, such as Safari, Mail, and all other standard Apple programs. If you are a Firefox user or hate Safari for whatever reason, for the time being you will probably want to use Safari since most webpages look significantly better on the retina display until they come out with updates. In a way I guess the retina display is almost too good for it's own good at the moment, and moments when you see lower resolutions scaled or other displays will probably aggravate you. Even so after using these new displays I would never want to change back and the benefit it gives photographers/graphics artists/movie producers is unprecedented, and more importantly it will begin a shift towards everything being higher resolution like the HDTV shift a few years ago.", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you can afford it - buy it. It is without peer.", "Author": "Sam Park", "ReviewID": "R3E2FOEO18VYZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here is my brutally honest review of my 2.6Ghz Retina MacBook Pro:Before I talk about the screen, solid-state storage or reduction in size and weight the thing that always comes up before buying a computer that ends up being a bit north of $3k is, is it worth it? In my honest opinion, if you have to ask yourself that question then it's probably too expensive for you and you'll be better served with a MBA (MacBook Air) or a non-retina MBP. For all the rest who don't have an issue spending $3k on a computer - in which case I'm guessing it will reside amongst several computers in your household, along with a plethora of other expensive electronic devices - this review is more for you.1. The retina screen: without doubt the biggest selling point is the new retina display. There are 3 things that make it a joy to use: The first is the uber sharp resolution that makes everything literally pop on the screen and especially makes vibrant colors (such as the dock icons) look painted on the screen. The second, and often overlooked, aspect of the retina display is the new manufacturing method that eliminates a glass cover over the LCD display itself. The outcome of this is that glare is dramatically reduced. The literature states by 75% but in use and if compared with any non-retina MBP, it is a world of a difference. In most cases glare does not exist. Lastly, the use of IPS technology makes viewing angles crazy good. So good as a matter of fact that it really doesn't matter too much which angle you put it to - everything looks good. But when you do hit the sweet spot, as there invariably always is a sweet spot, the screen just looks magical, mundane things look like artwork.2. SSD: this is the future of all portable device storage. Apple created the SSD marketplace with the iPod, which beget the iPad, which beget the MBA, which finally beget the rMBP. Again everything will ultimately move in this direction in several years but Apple is again ahead of the curve - or in this case creating the curve. It's wicked fast. Don't waste your time looking at those silly youtube videos that compare boot time. What really matters is random and sequential read/write speeds and it blows the doors off of metal disks spinning, no matter how fast they spin. Who turns off and on their computers regularly anyways? Mine stays on perpetually until it needs a restart due to a OS update. Goes to sleep instantly with lid closed and wakes up iPad fast.3. New guts: This is the most boring part. Yes, Ivy Bridge is fast and more efficient than Sandy Bridge. Next.4. Finally USB 3 - long overdue but finally here. PC world has had it for what seems like forever. USB 2 was decade old tech compared with Thunderbolt and USB 3. Don't complain about losing the Firewire 800 port as you can always use a Thunderbolt adapter for any legacy devices  (if you can afford a $3k computer you can afford a $30 adapter). Both USB 3 and Thunderbolt are faster. Not many devices have Thunderbolt yet but everything has USB 3. Bonus is the HDMI port.5. Size - Don't compare it's size and weight to a MBA, completely different product category. Compared with the last gen MBP's the rMBP is much lighter and worlds thinner. It changes the look and feel of the laptop to a degree that's hard to describe unless you hold it in your hands. It makes the non-retina MBP look very dated.So in summation, if purchasing a $3k computer isn't too big a deal for you - and there are plenty of you out there since inventory is so tight - buy without hesitation as the rMBP is without peer. Sure you'll have to wait a bit for some applications to become retina optimized but I'm guessing this isn't your only computer.

You know, iPad, iPhone, i this and i that. She says why don't yo get an Apple laptop so I will be familiar with it's OS.

Even with the powerful GeForce 650M graphics card powering the device, the resolution is just too high, but you can set the resolution down in both games and it doesn't look too bad.Playing Blu-Ray discs in Windows in native resolution looks great, the video quality that is... however, there WILL be some screen tearing that you will see as the movie plays which is a bit disappointing. It seems that the resolution is just still a little too early for it's time with regards to being powered by a mobile graphics card.Great computer, build quality is there, post purchase upgrade options are non-existant, will last a long time if you're using it for business purposes. But if you're using it for gaming then of course it will be outdated in a few years due to the graphics card. If you do purchase this though make sure you get the bigger memory size and hard drive size as you won't be able to change those onboard options in the future.The only reason I deducted the 5th star was because of the inability to upgrade the hard drive or memory. I definitely understand the reason it's ability to be thin was because of decisions like these but it still doesn't help if the hard drive or memory goes bad.

I originally had enough money to either get this or the Samsung Series 9, but after I reviewed the tech specs I realized that this was by far the better purchase. I did buy both computers in the end, but this one has so much power that it is unmatched by any other computer. Even Alienware(tm) and Lenovo(tm) cannot compare with it's specs: there is no other computer that can have tech specs so high and only weigh just slightly under five pounds. With this computer, you really cannot go wrong!Before I continue, I must add that I got my computer from Apple(tm) because Amazon did not provide the configuration of the computer that I wanted. My computer has 16 GB of RAM, 768 GB of SSD, Intel Core i7 Quad-core Processor that clocks at 2.7 GHZ (per core) and has over-clocking at (up to) 3.7 GHZ.This computer is amazingly lightweight for it's size. I use it mostly for digital sculpting, and because of the dual graphics cards (it has Intel HD 4000, as well as NVIDIA 650M), I can easily do with with no problems. Some people said that they are uncertain whether or not they would prefer the 13\". I must say that personally, there would be no use for the computer for me because without the NVIDIA graphics card, the workload that it can handle is limited. If your willing to spend the extra money, go with the 15\"!Pros:Screen Resolution.Great Processing SpeedRuns high-end games smoothly (I've played Dishonored and Assassin's Creed with out any lagging(about 50fps for Dishonored))Very Easy to Install Windows 7 (there currently are not any drivers for Windows 8, but there will soon be)Beautiful DesignVersatile and light-weightInstant-on (meaning that startup is a breeze; it took it less than six seconds last time!)Great speakersSilent fans are great (powerful, but can get a little noisy when there is a high workload)You can edit full, un-compressed video files in 1080p format, right from the editing panelIt stays extremely cool for \"everyday\" computing tasks, like surfing the web and editing photosCons:If playing games, the computer can get a little hotThe fans can get loud when using large applicationsThe lack of a CD drive can get annoying, however if you have a portable drive, its barely noticeable (I have an external Blu-ray player that works great on both the Windows and Mac partitions!)After getting used to the native screen resolution, displays with lesser PPI look extremely pixelated (not sure if this is a pro or a con...)The price may be steep for those that are going to use it occasionally...As you can see there are many pros, and but only a few cons. This is by far the best computer that I could have ever gotten, and, though it is almost flawless, there are still flaws. Though these flaws are, at most, marginal errors that one can easily overlook, once you gain favor of this great laptop, there's no way you can go back.

This laptop is thinner, lighter, faster, and sleeker than ever before. It also comes with Apple's brand new 2880 by 1800 screen resolution with the all new retina display. With \"over 5 million pixels on the 15-inch model, the Retina display on Macbook Pro is an incredible engineering feat\" (Apple). But it is the opposite of heavy. With the thickness at just 0.71 inches, this laptop weighs barely 4.46 pounds. However, this all comes with a price. A whopping $2,199 plus tax (Apple). Most laptops that fit in the same criteria of this new Macbook Pro do not even come down to half this price. So is this new Macbook Pro worth its price tag?  Most laptops in the $1000 price range now already come with the same specifications as the Macbook Pro--the latest quad-core Intel Core i7 processors with hyper threading, an NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M dedicated graphics processor or better, and up to 16GB of GDDR3 RAM (Random Access Memory). These specifications are easily feasible in today's modern laptop lineups, with not even half the price (Newegg). Even if the processor of this new Macbook is faster with the additional costs, it will hardly be noticeable. Flash storage, such as the solid state drive that is available on the new Macbook, can be obtained with any other laptop as well. However, many other competing laptop brands cannot achieve the \"thickness\" and weight of the new Macbook Pro.  If you are looking for amazing hardware, you probably will not find anything noticeably different between the new Macbook and other competing laptop brands. This is because it all comes down to the design of this laptop. The Macbook is thinner and lighter than any laptop that would contain all these specifications. However, in order to accommodate for its small size, everything has to be integrated onto the motherboard in the new Macbook Pro. That means the RAM, the flash drive storage, the processor, and the graphics processing unit has to be made on the motherboard. This is problematic because if you wanted to upgrade the parts on your laptop, you would not be able to do that on the Macbook Pro. Everything is integrated; you cannot swap out old parts for new ones. Almost no other displays on the market can match up to Apple's 2880 by 1800 pixel screen resolution. Not even flat screen LED televisions. With this, it delivers the most stunning, crisp video and imaging playbacks, immersing you into the screen with immense details. The design is lightweight and versatile; it has no large screws and rough edges that you would find on other laptops. The flawless design gives it a stunning look. However, this thin profile has led to Apple having to eliminate the optical drive and ethernet port. The Macbook Pro comes with a standard backlit keyboard. Most laptops can only give you the option of having it either on or off; Macbooks can adjust the intensity of its LEDs. On both sides of the keyboard, you will see two huge speakers with a built in subwoofer. These stereo speakers produce a huge sound in a small package. Compared with built in speakers on other laptops, the winner is clear. The speakers on this laptop are impressively louder than many other laptops. The battery life on this laptop is amazing and can easily be compared above many other laptops in the same benchmark.Looking around on the design, there seems to be no vents or fans. But that is because they are hardly noticeable. Near the bottom of the left and right side of the laptop are two tiny slits for air to flow in. Under the display near the back of the laptop will be one larger vent where the intake fans are. These fans are thin and highly efficient. While moving the maximum amount of air with these fans, they are nearly silent (Apple). Other laptops have large vents with huge fans. However, the fan sizes on these laptops do not determine the cooling. Although large, these fans are immensely inefficient and can produce a lot of noise during extreme work or gaming. The only downside is that Macs cannot play many of these games because they are PC orientated games.  Apple's operating system OS X Mountain Lion and many previous versions of the Mac OS cannot run many programs that are oriented for windows based computers. This means programs such as the latest games today, the latest versions of Microsoft Office, and many other programs fit for Windows will not work on Apple's Macbook pro. You can run Bootcamp on a Mac, which allows you to use a windows operating system on your Apple computer, but that will take another $119.99 out of your wallet. Most of the programs on the Mac OS are oriented toward business or professional use--not for ordinary college or high school students. Most modern day students will rarely many programs that come with the OS. That is because most of these programs are based more for professional based use for music and video/image editing. For students who are picture enthusiasts, it is widely known that the application Instagram will more likely be used.  Most users today are not professional entrepreneurs or hard-core gamers. Most are just ordinary students or adults who use laptops for email, word processing, social media, web-browsing, and maybe a little bit of casual gaming. That would tone down the price of a modern day laptop to around $500 with necessary programs already preinstalled onto a typical user friendly operating system. So for a laptop more than four times the price of an average laptop with an operating system that is not essential for ordinary users, is the price really justified (Grevstad)? In the end it really comes down to the users. Ordinary users who will just use their computer to browse the internet or post \"vintage\" pictures on Instagram will not really get much out of it. But for movie editors and hardware engineers, this laptop's hardware and software will definitely meet their needs. \"If, however, you're a serious content creator or an image or video enthusiast, dealing daily with 20-megapixel-plus photos or multiple 1080p video clips, the MacBook Pro with Retina Display is not just a wish-list or status-symbol laptop--it's a ticket to new levels of productivity.

In fact had owed the retinas predecessor. I absolutely LOVED my Macbook Pro. When my Pro got dropped among other things it was a hard choice to chose wether or not to upgrade to the Retina. Because Best Buy gave me the 1700  i spent on it because i had the protection plan on it. I decided to \"upgrade\" to the retina. I write \"upgrade\" because it's really a trade off. Each Computer has it's pros and Cons. The Retina well... has the Retina Display. And the Display is stunning. Seriously. I cant tell you how much i LOVE it! The Text is amazing, photos are brilliant. And it really does create a whole new experience with your computer. However. There is no Disc. Drive. And not everyone pirates all their media ;) I do miss the DVD/CD drive. Solid Stats hard drive is nice... but not necessary. I would of rather have a larger Hard Drive and less speed.  I\"m a videographer. I know the advantages of having a faster hard drive. But size really does matter. Also - the Retina lost my Firewire port :( Sad day! All my hard drives had Firewire. I loved Firewire :-/ But i gained a HTMI Port! :D Thats amazing! Finally! No more stupid Mini Display! Now... the Thinness of this computer is just 'down right cool' It's so sleek and thin, and beautiful in design. No doubt because they took out the poor Disc. Drive.The speed of this computer is amazing! Photoshop CS5, Final Cut Pro X, runs flawlessly on this masterpiece.So - should you buy it?Depends... Do you really want a Solid State Hard Drive, Or the Retina Display? Then Sure buy it. But if you can live without that. Then i would say It's not worth the money. I would pick up the Previous model for cheeper, larger hard drive, and a DVD drive. Sure.. this is the \"latest and greatest\" but if Best Buy didn't give me 1700 for my old one because of their protection plan on it. I would NOT have upgraded to this one! All the Bells and whistles are nice. But certainly not a necessity!Both models have their pros and Cons. Weigh each of them and then cringe as you part ways with your cash.

But there is just so much to say about this laptop. I bought mine directly from Apple.com. Keep in mind if you do this it make take a while to get to your doorstep since it is built in China. I was okay with this, it was nice to know it wasn't sitting on a shelf in some warehouse for months on end.This is my first macbook and I'm glad I waited until this one came out. I have been using a very capable windows machine I built myself about 8 months ago, but I found that I missed the portability of a laptop. In my opinion the price is very reasonable at 2199. IPS displays aren't cheap, let alone one that runs at 2880x1800, which FYI, didn't exist in the consumer market until now. You can't compare it to the competition, because it has none. I won't go into deep details about the display since there are plenty or other reviews praising it. Simply put, its something you have to experience to truly appreciate. The three things that I think make the macbook pro with retina worth the price are, 1) the display, 2) Flash storage 3) battery life. My biggest beef with high end laptops has always been battery life. My last laptop was an HP. It was very powerful, but it might as well have not even had a battery. With this laptop running at mid brightness and doing regular tasks, web surfing over wifi, email, listening to music and typing I can get about 7-9 hours. The main reason for this is because I bought the base model with the lowest powered CPU(which is still a very powerful CPU). On a side note I will say that this thing actually has amazing speakers for a laptop. Obviously there won't be any bass, but they still have rich and powerful sound. In my opinion this was just more icing on the cake.Pros:Gorgeous display that currently can only be found on this laptop. This is why you want the macbook pro with retina.  Excellent battery life that is unmatched for something this powerful  great speakers  backlit keyboard  excellent trackpad, but still not good for games  Mac OS X mountain lion  excellent software choices, despite not being a windows computer  despite being so thin, it is feels very sturdy and well built, though I would expect nothing less from Apple.Cons: high entry price(but understandable given the specs)  cannot upgrade the ram or replace battery unless you send it to apple. If you don't know what 8GB of ram even means then it will probably be more than enough for you.  Maintenance is very expensive. I wouldn't recommend taking this somewhere where it could easily be damaged, unless you buy the expensive extended warranty. Stick to coffee shops. And buy a protective case  no ethernet(but HDMI and usb 3.0 was added) This could be an annoyance for some, but I always connect to WIFI anyways. You can buy an adapter for this too.This is a laptop designed for professionals, but everyone will want one. If you are not a heavy user, I would recommend getting a regular Macbook Pro, my dad just bought one and he loves it. I wouldn't really consider the Air unless they release it with a retina display. This could happen as early as next year, but I wouldn't count on it. If you don't care about portability I would recommend an iMac 27 inch, they are powerful and have a beautiful display.If you are worried about learning a new Operating system, let me put your mind at ease. It's easy. I feel like I have mastered the basics without really trying that hard. OS X is very intuitive and user friendly.The new Macbook is also not a bad gaming machine. Even if you have windows games, you can easily install windows 7 for those. A lot of games are now offered for Mac and Windows. Diablo 3 and Starcraft II are my favorites.All my friends are Apple haters, but even they were impressed by what this laptop offers. Don't listen to the haters out there.

CS6's Mercury engine does all rendering using software... not the GPU which is disappointing. It's still renders super fast though. Hopefully Adobe will provide an upgrade to support the NVIDIA GeForce GT 650M.For me, the overall performance of this laptop is what made it worth it.Using my previous Macbook Pro 2011 with 8GB's of RAM, when I finished running a Windows 7 program on Parallels, I shut my VM down as soon as possible as it really degraded my response time on the Mac side.  With this new laptop, I purchased it with 16GB of RAM for an extra $200 and I can now keep my Windows VM running and the MAc side is still faster them my old i7 2011 Macbook pro.

I was amazed by how great it sounded!The new magsafe falls out easy when it's on my lap. If I just lightly touch it with my leg it falls out, not horrible but it's less then the best design in my opinion. I foresee the power cable breaking on the inside and having to purchase additional power supplies at least yearly. I hope I'm wrong as they are not cheap.I hear the fan when I load the CPU. It's not super loud but it's not silent either. It does get hot under load but it feels cooler then other Windows 7 desktop replacement laptops I've used. It's manageable.The keyboard feels fantastic, I love the response of the keys. The fact that I had to buy a GB Ethernet dongle and an external DVD was not a big deal. I love the 2 USB 3 ports, finally! Thunderbolt, I may use it one day for something other then the Ethernet dongle.The only other ding is I had to reset the SMC as from the factory it did not sleep on battery when I closed the lid. Once I reset the SMC it slept fine and the battery is better then my 2011 MBP though still lacking. When the CPU is being pushed it does suck power. 4 to 5 hours is what I'm getting and I do load it.

This is my first Mac and I have relatively little prior experience with it. The gesture-rich touchpad requires maybe half an hour to get used to, then it comes quite naturally. Very nicely designed, here is a few things I dont like:1) Lack of standard ports, the need for a lot of adaptors- No ethernet port: Although wireless is very ubiquitous, i sometimes need to transfer many gigabytes and ethernet is still the better way as of late 2012.- No Microphone jack: need a USB adapter for external microphone- NO CD drive2) No upgradability- Memory chip glued to board, so you will be stuck with 8 or 16GB of RAM forever, which is probably the only thing that might need upgrading in the next 5 years.3) SSD is a big tradeoff. I guess I preferred the SSD thats why I got it, but 256GB is only enough space for a few big programs, and cannot hold many big files that I work with4) Well, cannot adjust the resolution (like halving it if desired). Looks very nice in native apps, and crappy for other apps...5) No reparability. I've opened my share of computers through the years, and often successfully fixed them. Just opening this one requires getting some strange screw drivers.6) the machine is too light, I like getting some exercise hauling things aroundI am impressed by:0) The touchpad is very usable. On any other machine I've used, it is annoying to work them without a mouse. I can actually just use the touchpad without getting annoyed.1) the screen2) how quiet it is now with no spinning harddrive, the only thing moving is the fan.3) download at 20MBps, and install programs in an instant with the fast SSD.4) Very thin for a powerful machineBesides those. If you are a former linux user, all the unix commands that you've learned over the years still works here. You can likely adapt quite quickly if you are familiar with Windows GUI, but there is always a few strangeness that takes a while to get used to, and make sure you learn the gestures. This machine still interacts better with all the linux servers than a Windows machine does. And it is just a smoother machine than any linux machines I've used, I still love them, but they just lack the polish to be usable for most consumers without the terminal.Probably one the best machines at the $2000 range. If I am to buy a computer myself, I probably would have bought a very good $1000 PC. But if you have a $2000 budget for a machine, then PCs get expensive very quickly without getting much better (there you should buy memory and harddrive separately). zareason is a supplier of pretty good linux laptops, and you cannot actually get it to be clearly better without going into the 3000s. Samsung series 7 and the good old thinkpad are all good options at the $1300 range.

Yes, it's expensive, but I believe well worth the money.First off, the main reason to get one of these MBPs is the Retina screen.  The contrast and clarity of this screen is amazing.  The native resolution is equivalent to 1440 x 900 (Which is considered optimal resolution), but you can bump the resolution to a 1920 x 1200 equivalent.  That's the same resolution as on the old 17\" model.  Even though it's not the native resolution, because the pixels are so small you can't event tell and it still looks insanely crisp.  What's also cool is that since the screen does not have a cover glass, when viewing the screen at a sharp angle, the picture seems to be pasted right at the surface.  Even though there's no cover glass, the screen is not any less sturdy or protected.  There are also some third party apps that will let you use full resolution (2880 x 1800) if you don't mind tiny UI elements.  I will admit that my MBP had a small defect in the screen.  It had a tiny light leak in the lower left corner, but after taking it in to the Apple store and having them look at it, they said they would ship a new one out to replace mine (putting a deposit on my cc in the mean time so I wasn't without a laptop).Components.  I have the base model with a RAM upgrade.  Those of you who are weary of the lack of upgradability shouldn't be concerned.  Ask yourself 2 questions... will I ever upgrade it? and why would I need to?  For me, I wanted would have wanted to upgrade myself because I felt the premium Apple was charging for the components was a little steep.  I wouldn't recommend a SSD upgrade because the price increase is ridiculous.  It's got USB 3.0 and Thunderbolt ports.  For less than $500, you can get an external 512GB SSD that runs at full speed on USB 3.0.  I upgraded the RAM on mine to 16GB since it's soldered on the main board.  At $200 I didn't feel like it was too much more to pay.  Getting 2 8GB 1600 RAM sticks will run about $120.  It's an $80 premium that Apple charges over your own upgrade.  Since most laptops that come with 8GB of RAM will usually have 2 4GB sticks, you'd need to buy 2 8GB sticks anyways, so you'd be paying for 24GB of RAM but only using 16GB (the 2 x 4GB chips that came with the laptop + the new 2 x 8GB chips if you did your own upgrade).  And you might have to go through the trouble of faulty RAM or whatnot, so the price Apple is charging is justified.The whole package.  The best part about this laptop is that all this power comes in an amazing package.  It's ridiculous how slim the case is.  It's incredibly light and easy to carry around and feels very sturdy.  The build quality is exactly what you would expect from a $2000+ laptop.  The quality of materials is outstanding.  I will say that when you close the lid and press down on the center of the laptop (where the Apple logo is), there is some give and the case flexes (still not nearly as much as my 16\" HP whose screen is about as thick as the entire MBP), so I wouldn't put anything relatively heavy on top of it when it's closed, but it's still much sturdier than any other laptop I've ever owned.  It's portability is amazing.  Compared to my last HP laptop (HP hdx1000) of the same size, I think the full thickness of the MBP is just slightly thicker than just the LCD portion of the HP.Battery life.  People complain that the battery is glued into the case and a new one costs $199.  It's a big battery and can power the laptop for an average of about 6-8 hours with moderate use.  A comparable battery on any other laptop would cost just as much.  The battery also has a life rating of 1000 cycles which means it can go through 1000 full charge cycles before it starts losing capacity.  You can still use your battery after 1000 full cycles, but with less maximum capacity from the battery.  A cycle is a full charge so 2 days recharging 50% of the battery would count as 1 cycle, etc.Price.  It's expensive.  But so is a BMW and a BMW does basically the same thing as a Hyundai.  Actually, if you do a price comparison with a PC with similar specs, the PC may end up being around the same price if not more expensive.  Not quite the same, but they recently spec bumped the Dell XPS 13 ultrabook to match the specs of the 13\" Macbook Air, and it was more expensive than the Air.  Besides, I don't think there are any other laptops out there right now that can match the specs on a MBP Retina at the moment.  Even if you spec bump the brand new non-retina MBP to a comparable Retina MBP, the Retina MBP will come out around $200 cheaper.Final verdict.

This laptop deserves 4.5-5 stars for several reasons, even though it might have a couple drawbacks. All the other reviews have mentioned most of the benefits of this laptop with good clarity, so I won't bore you with telling you how awesome it is besides two critical points I mention below:First, I'd like to comment about the price. Apple always gets hate for having a premium price, but in my opinion the product you buy is always worth the price. You are paying for the design, engineering, premium components, screen (especially in this case), etc. What's more, with this particular laptop, when you put things into perspective, it really isn't \"more expensive\". If you want to buy an old style 15\" MacBook Pro with the same specs as this new 15\" MacBook Pro with Retina Display, you would be paying $300 more for it! Sure you'd get an optical drive, but you'd also add a pound of weight and get less resolution. It's a no-brainer to get this over the old style MacBook Pro.Next, I'd like to comment about the weight. Yes, it's heavier than most ultrabooks, but it's also a lot more powerful than them--this is a \"Pro\" laptop, with pro specs. For once I was satisfied with a laptop's factory specs. I have no desire to upgrade anything because this thing flies as it is. I might have wanted more hard drive space on the base model, though (it comes with 256GB and you can't upgrade the base to 512GB, you have to buy the higher model of the computer). I've had the older 15\" MacBook pro before Apple went unibody and this thing is thinner and lighter than that (it's obviously also lighter than the old design unibody). In other words, for me, it is noticeably lighter and light enough to carry around everyday. How \"heavy\" something is, not in terms of actual pounds, but how it feels to carry something around differs from person to person. For me this thing feels light, especially compared to other 15\" laptops of this power on the market. The point is, weight (the feel of it) is relative and you have to hold this thing to decide if it's light enough for you. If you're in the market for a laptop and this one is in your budget, I'd highly recommend it (at least check it out for the retina display ;-)Thanks and hope this helps!", "Date": "June 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "First time Mac user", "Author": "Nimajneb", "ReviewID": "R1YL7SXSSZH6ZF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "About 4 weeks ago, I purchased my first Mac - the 2011 MBP. I was amazed at how slick the graphics were, how fast it booted up, how fast programs loaded, how intuitive it was to use, and how gorgeous it was compared to the Dells, HPs, and Thinkpads I've owned and used for the last 20+ years. Note that I'm a management consultant and therefore a power PC user, and still use my company-issued PC for work everyday.So I mentioned how much I loved my new Mac to some buddies who then basically called me a moron for buying a 2011 MBP when Apple was about to update their entire Macbook line in a few weeks. So I used my 2011 MBP for 14 days, then returned it to wait for Apple to launch the new line.On June 11, I promptly logged onto the Apple website and ordered the MBP with Retina display. I received my unit on June 18. Holy cow - this thing smokes! The quality of the display is unbelievable. I play Diablo III and Starcraft on my PC, and remember how they looked on the 2011 MBP. Let me say the Retina display blows both away. The games are super crisp...I notice things on the game that I never noticed before. Little details. It's like having cataract surgery and finally seeing everything clearly for the first time (not that I would know how someone with cataracts see). In addition, this thing boots up in like 5 seconds. Programs load almost instantly. It's thin and light. Battery lasts almost 7 hours (2 hours when playing games that use the NVIDIA processor).The only negative I can think of is that it doesn't have a slot with which I can use my cable lock. So if I'm in Starbucks and need to use the bathroom, I have to take it with me. Also, while the fact that this MBP is not upgradeable bothers me slightly, my actual experience with both work and home PCs is that I've replaced them every 2-5 years anyway.

Retina screens do make a difference for phones since people often hold phones 6in to 1ft away from their face. However, normal laptop usage is 1-3ft away from the screen and I guarantee that you won't be able to see the pixels of any full HD screen. High resolution is also conducive to unnecessary eyestrain as many people neglect to increase the font to an appropriate size. Beyond the Retina screen, there really isn't anything special about this laptop. It doesn't even have the fastest mobile Ivy Bridge processor. Graphics professionals are the only people that might need this laptop are but even they should do most of their editing on much larger screens.  Also, most programs don't even work properly with the Retina screen yet as indicated by many other people.  Until Apple fixes this, you'll have less graphics functionality than you had with previous generation Macbooks and this graphics functionality is exactly what you paid for!The iPhone (due to subsidy) and iPad are good value buys but this PC simply has a stratospheric price. For the price of the best model, you could buy an ultrabook with similar specs (around $1000), a much more powerful desktop with dual 24in monitors (around $1000+$300), and a tablet (around $500). I have no problem spending this amount of cash on a computer but the only way we can get these Macbooks at reasonable prices is if people stop buying them at ridiculous prices. You might ask, how could you give bad to a decent product? Well, if a vendor sold overpriced gold-bars, I'd guarantee that it would receive numerous bad reviews even though the gold bar is as high quality as any other that can be purchased.The most cost effective thing to do is get an older laptop version (Ivy Bridge is not much of an upgrade from Sandy Bridge) and add a SSD drive and you'll get more or less the performance of this laptop.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Future of Portable Computing?", "Author": "M. Harward \"squark192\"", "ReviewID": "R3RDIO0ZQ01I7R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was really torn on this computer.  I initially ordered the 8GB version with plans to upgrade to aftermarket 16GB memory.  Then my co-worker told me I couldn't do that.I cancelled my order and stewed about it for awhile.  I was upset with Apple and felt like they were moving in the wrong direction.  I almost bailed.But I kept coming back to a few unavoidable truths.  Namely...1.  If I want the retina display, then this is it.  I do development on my MacBook Pro.  And screen resolution is everything to me.  Nothing else even comes close to this right now.  I am currently using a 17\" MacBook Pro, and this blows it away.2.  The specs are excellent.  For a notebook this size, I can't think of what else I would need.  Honestly, the last time I loaded a CD / DVD into my current notebook was probably a year ago (although my daughter uses hers all the time).3.  This is probably a glimpse of the future in notebooks (at least from Apple).  Like the iPad and the iPhone, Apple is increasingly viewing notebook computers as consumer electronic devices.  Think TVs, not computers.  I wouldn't think of cracking open my TV and upgrading the components.  This is the future of Apple.  Make stuff that works, de-emphasize the individual components, and simplify the device for the consumer.I can't say I totally agree with the direction, but I also can't say I have a real issue with it.With my current MBP I upgraded the memory once.  And I upgraded the hard drive 3 times.  I made sure to max the specs on my new MBP Retina to minimize the need to upgrade.  We'll see if that strategy works.However, I also had to replace my current MBP's battery once.  I'm a little concerned about that with the new MBP Retina.Having said that, though, I thought the same thing with my first iPhone... I thought it was a huge mistake by Apple to not let me replace my phone battery (because every prior phone I'd had needed a battery replaced at some point).  And the absence of external storage seemed heinous at the time.  I can honestly say that I've never thought twice about my iPhone battery or storage.Same with the iPads.  You pick your storage and that's it.  No upgrading it.  No consumer-replaceable battery.  You got what you got.  And I've never thought twice about that.So I'm going to give Apple the benefit of the doubt.  It's worked in the past.  I'm still not totally sold on moving the notebooks closer to the iPad / iPhone model... but that's mostly for legacy reasons.  I'm willing to give it a shot.I do feel that the price should probably be a bit lower.  Not because of the components and what I get, but because it feels like the plan is to replace the computer every 2-3 years.  That has to be factored in at some point.With all that said, the new MBP is much faster than my old (first gen) MBP 17\".  The retina display really is stunning.  I've tuned mine all the way to the \"More Space\" setting and the resolution is amazing (for anyone who doesn't notice much difference with the new display, it's likely because it's still set to the factory default, which looks like a brighter version of the old screen).3rd-party apps that don't take advantage of the new display are noticeably lower-quality than the Apple apps.  I'm hopeful that all my primary software vendors release updates soon to take advantage of the new display (a smaller, temporary gripe that should be fixed as more publishers update their software).I did briefly consider backpedaling a bit and getting a new MBP non-retina to retain the upgrade path... but I just couldn't get over the screen.I think I'll be happy with my decision.  I'll edit once I've used it a bit longer.But I'm sure of this... like it or not, this is probably the future of \"consumer electronic\" notebook computers.

I then have to reset and just live with using a PC to grab the files and either email them to me or upload them to a google drive.  I would think this issue is only because my computer might have some programming issues... however, like I said, I have about 7 co-workers who have the exact same issue.Problem #2: Whenever doing a \"system update,\" after installing the new files, it sits at the 99% installed slider-bar for about... 20 minutes or more (20 minutes was the longest I could wait before not doing work).  The only choice you have to get the computer to work is by doing a reset.Problem #3: If ever you by chance download a .zip or .exe file on accident... guess what!  Frozen!  Only solution?  Reset!

The slider ends at 1920 x 1200 (Which is nice!) You can find apps the push the resolution all the way to 1800p but be ready to be hovering your nose over the keyboard and into the display.6.

I can't get a replacement cause they are in no apple store to be found. I would have to wait almost a month to get a new one, given that I return this MBP that i have now... but i can't let it go.

I own many Apple products and I admit that I am partial to the brand.  The reason I am partial is because the products they sell are not only innovative but among the best quality available.  In our home we have 2 iMacs, 3 Macbook Pros, 2 iPads, 2 iPhones, 3 Apple TV's, and a ton of accessories for all.  Every product has served us well over the years and has been reliable and generally problem free.  The new Retina Macbook Pro is the nicest of the bunch.  Its slim, lightweight, and very fast.  The retina display is absolutely gorgeous.  Photos look incredible and text is sharp and clean and easy on the eye.  From power off to full boot is less than 10 seconds every time.  The battery lasts a long time in between charges and can charge from completely dead to full battery in very little time.  It feels lighter than my 2010 13\" Macbook Pro and slides into the laptop sleeve in my backpack with no problems.  I purchased it 2 days after the release date and have loved every second I have used it.  I see many reviews from people who haven't even purchased the product, some good and some bad.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  It is expensive but I feel that you get what you pay for.

Ware Cornell Jr. \"anotherlawyer\"", "ReviewID": "R32OV5782512QC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When Steve Jobs uttered his now-famous last words he knew that the Retina Display was headed for the Mac Book Pro. Now it has arrived and while I hope these words won't be my last \"Oh wow!\"My wife thinks my acquisition of the new 15\" MBP was impulsive. To some extent she is right. I did not expect it to be in stock and when I found that it was in stock, I had it and an AppleCare Protection Plan for Mac Laptops 15 Inches and Above (NEWEST VERSION) in hand.So why would an often sensible lawyer get so wildly enthused about a new Mac? The answer is just not the Retina Display. A Retina Display is a term Apple dreamed up for a screen with an pixel count so high that even close up, the human I cannot discern individual pixels. The result of this technology is an eye-popping exhibition of high mega-pixel photographs and 1080p video. The speakers are upgraded as well, but is not the excellent audio quality that has driven buyers to the new Mac. It is clearly the display.And in some respects the focus on pixel count is unfortunate. This may be the first laptop that is powerful enough for \"heavy lifting\" (which to a lawyer means legal memoranda, briefs and contracts) while light enough to give you pause as to whether you can get by with an Apple iPad MD368LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T; 4G, Black) NEWEST MODEL. We may be entering the post PC world, but there are still times when a laptop is necessary.My new MBP replaces a 2 1/2 year old 17\" MacBook Pro. There is nothing wrong with it, and as Apple products hold their value incredibly well, I expect to sell it for about two-thirds of its original price. When I move beyond this model, I expect similar retention of value. That is a factor to consider when purchasing laptops. Windows machines are much cheaper, but the resale price of a two year old Windows laptop is minuscule.One concern I had was about the storage. This model has 256 GB storage which is about half of the hard drive capacity on my 17\" MBP. Since I back up wirelessly with Apple Time Capsule 2TB MD032LL/A [NEWEST VERSION] I knew I had more data than the solid state drive could handle. However, much of that was in photographs, movies and music. All of my music, or at least most of it is in the cloud thanks to iTunes Match. My photographs are mostly in PhotoStream on iCloud, and my movies can be retrieved from the backup devices. With that savings I was left with about 75% of capacity.This laptop weighs in at a little over 4 pounds versus the 7 plus pounds of my last MBP. It is also thinner. It is obviously heavier than an iPad, but its a nice size for a full service machine.So how does this 2.3 GHz Quad-Core Intel i7 processor run? Like lightning.Aperture 3 used to take minutes to boot, now it is almost instantaneous.Some will say that solid state drives are more reliable because, unlike conventional hard drives, they have no moving parts. Bear this in mind. This is still a machine. I buy Applecare for a reason and that reason is peace of mind. It is probably the best warranty program out there, so pick it up when you buy.As Steve would say, \"Oh wow!\"", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "arrived quickly, in original box", "Author": "Kathy J.

And other times it's harder to pull out than I would expect.  I feel similarly about the adapter itself.  The fact that it comes with an extension cord seems nice at first, but now I hate having to keep up with the extra plug.  The material they use also doesn't fold up well.  I think they were going for something that doesn't tangle easily, but for me it gets in the way.- The retina display mostly works well in OSX.  My problem is I want to run Ubuntu in a VM, but at native resolution it's too small, and at the scaled resolution it's too big.  If I choose something in between everything's blurry because it's a non-native resolution.

Ive always wanted one but never could afford one. I decided to try this one out because of its superior build quality, better battery life, amazing screen, great apple support and how light and thin it is. I tried two macbooks that were idenical and they both had the same issues. The main issue or defect I had was that there was a creaking/clicking noise coming from the right corner next to the touchpad. Initially I thought I would just make an appointment with a mac genius and get the issue resolved either by a replacement or repair. As I used the macbook pro retina more I found more and more things I just didnt like that were not defects. I use my laptop mostly at my desk connected to my 32 inch samsung led tv as a monitor and wirless keyboard and mouse. When I hooked up the macbook to my tv via hdmi I found that there were ony 2 modes. One mode was mirror and the other was extending the desktop using both screens. I was used to using my tv as a monitor with my previous windows pcs by disabling the laptop screen and just using the tv screen. There was no way to do this with the macbook. I googled and googled and went on forums. There were a few workarounds like placing magnet over the left speaker grill to disable the internet screen or closing the clam shell of the macbook. I wasnt happy with these solutions. These solutions required the macbook to connected to power source and I had to initiate it every time turned on the macbook. I was surprised that a $2400 device could not do what my windows laptop which cost a fraction of it could do. Another thing that continued to annoy me about the macbook was the power adapter. I found it disconnect very easily from the macbook even if I didnt put that much pressure or pull too much. At first this was a defect or that I was missing something. I tried another macbook and also asked on the forums and found this was just normal. Both of the macbooks I got had the LG screen which wasnt suppose as good as the Samsung screen. The macbook also didnt work with samsung laser printer. I tried many drivers. The macbook did however work with my logitech wireless mouse and keyboard. I found the macbook speakers to be very flat sounding when compared to my current lenovo y580. The macbook also got very warm even with light tasks and hot extremely hot when gaming with civ 5 or even just more intensive tasks. I also found the fan to be fairly noisey on the macbook. On the good side the screen was aboustley stunning and battery life was also very good. The macbook was very light and thin and great looking. I also really like that the macbook had dedicated shortcut keys like: volume, music controls, brightness, keyboard brigtness, etc. The keyboard was extremely easy to type on and the best laptop keyboard I have ever used. I really liked the keyboard backlight brightness controls and the fact that I could set it switch off after a certain amount of time and use the light sensor to set the brightness. I also really liked the touchpad which was very smooth and easy to use with tons gestures. It was almost like using a touchscreen. I was disappointed with the mac app store. Considering it has been out for over 2 years now. I found it to be very limited and apps were extremely expensive. Windows 8 already has more apps and more commonly used ones and most of them are free. Overall the macbook was great but there were many little things that I mentioned which I just didnt expect to have issues with. Since I only use my laptop for browsing, email, youtube, gaming with civ 5. I would recommend this macbook to people who really need it for work like for photo editing, movie editing, web design, app designers, etc. My lenovo y580 That I purchased for less than half the price of the macbook is faster and is fully up gradable. I found the lack graphics card options with macbook disappointing. My y580 has double the vram and much better graphics card.

I just recently purchased the 15\" 2.6GHz 512MB version and while all is nice, there are some limitations for me which are severe and thus don't make it the right time to actually keep it. I tried to like the computer and was intent on keeping it as my main work computer, but I couldn't take it longer than the three days I had it and used it extensively. The biggest problem for me - the browsers. Are you dependent on using Google Chrome as I am for computer work? I do computer programming, quality assurance testing, and design work on my computer all day. The problem with Google Chrome is that what you see on the MacBook Pro Retina is not what others are seeing when using Google Chrome. For example, the text is very blurry, YouTube will not play videos in full screen, the sizing of the pages don't format correctly. Yes you can use Google's developer version of Chrome - Canary (the only other browser besides Safari which supports MacBook Pro Retina), and this will improve some things, but you still can't properly display YouTube videos in full screen mode. If you are 100% happy with exclusively using Safari then this will be a non-issue for you, but if you use ANY other browser then you will be disappointed. I find it hard to believe that Apple and Google didn't ensure that their browser will work properly on the MacBook Retina prior to launch.Also, I'm not thrilled with only 512MB of hard disk space (SSD) on a standard configuration computer. Yes you can custom order a configuration from Apple to take you up to 768GB SSD, but it will set you back an additional $500.00, quickly turning your $2700 computer into a $3200 computer. Also, you'll have to wait for any custom configuration from Apple. You can't just order it on Amazon or walk into a computer store selling MacBook Pro's and pick one up. I'm also concerned about not being able to add additional RAM into the computer. For now 8GB should be sufficient, but what if I want to add another 8 to take me to 16- you just can't do it, at least not yet as the RAM is physically built into the computer. Also, the battery is glued into the computer so if you wish to replace it one day it probably won't be something I can do on my own. Same with the SSD, if you want to upgrade on your own to a larger SSD you can't - it's also built into the computer. Seems that the design has been so streamlined into the smaller form factor that Apple wasn't able to provide the ability to allow more technically savvy computer folks to upgrade things on their own. In fact, I doubt that you'll be able to ever go to the Apple store and have them update RAM or the SSD for you. I assume they'll be able to service the batteries though, but that may involve sending your computer in or will the Apple Genius' be able to unglue and replace the battery?Do you use a firewire device for backups, such as with Time Machine? If so, then there's currently no Apple adaptor for FireWire to Thunderbolt which will allow you to leverage your device. Apple is slated to release the adaptor soon, but it's currently not available (there is one third-party solution available, but it's VERY expensive). You'll need a Thunderbolt adaptor because there are no longer any FireWire connectors on the MB Pro Retina. If you like to go wired for your Internet connection, you'll need to purchase an additional Thunderbolt adaptor. Do you already have MacBook Pros that you're using and would like to share your power supply/connector with your retina? You won't be able to unless you purchase a new Magsafe to Magsafe 2 adaptor. So be prepared to upgrade a bunch of the equipment that you may already have to be able to still leverage them with your MB Retina.So, while this is certainly a beautiful and top-of-the-line laptop, there are currently too many issues with software compatibility (i.e. browsers) and too many limitations on future hardware upgrades and longevity (battery) that make it a poor choice to be locked into. For those whom these are not issues then perhaps this is still a good laptop choice for you.Update: To see just how difficult the Macbook Pro Retina is to upgrade or work on see this: [...]", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "3rd time I've purchased a macbook and had to return it", "Author": "Michael J.

They weren't really sure what was wrong but I've read online others have experienced the same problem and alleviated it somewhat by turning off the automatic graphic card switching in energy saving preferences (this helped a little, but once Safari loaded up a page, the mac would randomly have the spinning wheel and crash, and restart).  This delivery of broken units has happened twice before with the 2010 and 2011 models, and you'd think the third time with this new retina model would be the charm and Apple would have the courtesy to refund at the least the shipping charges on the purchase (since I paid extra for fast delivery), or provide some caveat like a free apple protection plan for providing a faulty unit after a 3k purchase, and making me wait another two weeks for a replacement as well as for the time spent going to the genius bar.This review would be five stars if it wasn't for the fact that Apple really needs to do some better QA before shipping units out, 3 bad units out of 5 I've had is making me question the quality of Apple's macbook line and maybe if someone at Apple's customer service reads this review and upgrades the specs to the highest possible on my replacement unit, and the new unit works as advertised, or at the least, provides an apple care plan for the replacement, I'll consider changing this review.

Everything lags. I went to genius bar and they say my hands are tied and wait for update to see if that fixes. I should not have bought apple!The problems are:1) The wifi does not work2) The wake up screen freezes too long3) The noise of graphics card is too huge when watching movies4) When I slide between the desktop it freezes atleast sometime before it come backs to normal5) The safari is the worst browser.  a)  It lags when you scroll in safari  b)  Lately, when I open safari and slide between the deskstops it takes foreever as if the trackpad is not  working.  c)  It keeps logging me out of facebook.  d)  It is dirupting the display when you scroll the pages.6) When I try to use mission control it simply lags very ugly.7) The battery performance is worst. It not even close to 7 hrs as in advertisement.8) Its not even quieter when I watch movies or any other applications as told in advertisement.9) I did not have credit card so I did not make apple account so when I formated my computer as directed by the apple customer care I had to buy OS X mountain lion againg.And I spend 3000 bucks for this laptop and when I go to genius bar they expect me to just listen they can't help anymore. Why did I even buy this thing?", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best notebook computer ever created, by Apple or anyone!", "Author": "smc4242", "ReviewID": "R1UK6D41IEV023", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Now, I've been looking for a new laptop for a while now, and I decided to wait and get one after Apple's WWDC; and it was well worth the wait. While watching the conference, I was hoping to find a computer that would work for me, and this is the one. As noted in the presentation, this is the highest resolution notebook around today. You can't get anything better.  As well as being incredibly thin (though not as thin as the Macbook Air), it's also incredibly powerful. It's got the new Ivy Bridge processers, as well as a new graphics card. Another good thing about this is the addition of USB 3. No, not a USB 3 port that's separate from the USB 2; but for this computer, it's USB 2 and USB 3 being the same port. There are also two Thunderbolt ports, which can be used as either a data transfer port, like USB, or a video port, being known as MiniDisplay port. It's possible to get thunderbolt adapters to a gigabit ethernet port and a Firewire 800 port. You can also get an adapter that can transform MiniDisplay port video into VGA or DVI. Another great thing about this notebook, is the inclusion of HDMI, so you can connect it straight to your HDTV, which is what I intend to do. Flash memory is used instead of the hard drive, which is great. With the lower-end version, you get 256 GB of flash storage. With the higher end one, which is the one I got, it gives you 512 GB of flash storage, and configurable up to 768 GB.I've rambled on enough about how fantastic this machine is, so why don't I give you a list of Pros and Cons.Pros:Best display EVER put on a notebookUSB 3.0Ivy BridgeHDMITwo thunderbolt portsGreat graphicsTHIN!Cons:No optical drive (this isn't much of a problem, at least it wasn't for me)no gigabit ethernet or FW 800 (as I said above, you can get thunderbolt adapters for these)**EDIT**I'm taking it down a star for the lack of upgrade possibilities. On my old Macbook Pro, I replaced the harddrive three times, and upgraded the RAM once, and that was after Applecare expired. Even though it's more expensive, you should get what you think you'll need in the future, when ordering the Macbook pro with retina display.", "Date": "June 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "After years of not using Apple products, I was right.", "Author": "V4G480ND", "ReviewID": "R2FS4UTRILYNXS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Pros- Nice screen- Aesthetically pleasingCons- Overheats when running nothing but email- Severely lacking software support.
