{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The dual-mode video cannot be normalized on this model", "Author": "David M.", "ReviewID": "R2AQEUI2P0WT3F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We have all Dell laptops at our business and always ordered the performance video chipset.  For the previous models that had the Intel/NVidia combo video (E6420, E6430), we went into the BIOS under video and disabled Optimus.  At that point the Intel dual mode dropped out and you had only the nVidia video.  This permitted boot video while docked and otherwise made the laptop behave normally.The E6540 is using a dual mode Intel/AMD chipset instead of the Intel/NVidia and does not have Optimus as an option to disable under Video in the BIOS.As a result, you will often find the laptop performing some video with the power-saving Intel chipset when it should be using the AMD and when docked, you don't get any boot video until you are at the login prompt.If Dell releases a BIOS update that permits the machine to use the AMD video full-time, I will update this review.  Other than the crippled video, this is a really nice laptop.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E7LX8IO"}}
