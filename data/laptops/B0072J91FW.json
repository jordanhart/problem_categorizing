As for everything else, it runs smoothly and quickly. But take it from a guy who just found out his laptop was broken today, BE CAREFUL. I did not take good care of my laptop at points, and it came back to bite me in the arse. I had been getting troubles with my laptop over the past couple of days, and today, after well over 2 years, old nelly has crashed on me. The starting sounds happen and the LED power light is on. But the screen stays off. Whether the screen is broken or the heater is dead(the laptop doesn't warm up after being turned on in its current state, even after 5 hours of my absence), the laptop is dead.i do recommend this laptop, but take good care of it. I will be upgrading to a higher grade Acer Aspire due to price comparison of the used product and I will be getting 1gb more RAM, but I will be sticking with Acer. Thumbs up to over 2 years of an excellent laptop.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect!!!", "Author": "Erica MOnroe", "ReviewID": "R1SUC3NCDDOYDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for my son. it was his first laptop. it works perfectly and he loves it. it was a fast delivery and right on time for Christmas.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Screen Size: 15.6\"\nScreen Resolution: 1366 x 768\nProcessor Type: AMD\nProcessor Model: E-350\nProcessor Speed: 1.6GHz", "Name": "Acer 15.6\" Aspire Laptop 3GB 320GB | AS5250-BZ455", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ykMHNugSL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0072J91FW"}}
