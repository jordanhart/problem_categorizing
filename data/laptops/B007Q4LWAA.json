{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Was great for a year!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3FVZX9AY23R2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really loved this laptop when I bought it. Beautiful graphics and a reasonably fast processor. Connects via HDMI with full 1080 resolution. Very lightweight. The big issue now is the screen is SO lightweight that the left-hand corner where the hinge is mounted delaminated and the hinge fell apart. Impossible to close and open the laptop. Of course this happened just after the warranty ran out. It is not a simple fix. I have seen numerous postings relating to this issue. Overall a horrible design flaw. My purchase price with 12 Gb RAM upgrade comes out to about $700 so I guess you get what you pay for. I am about to find out if this is worth repairing or just using as a rather expensive streaming media device left open on the shelf. As of now it is worthless as a laptop.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007Q4LWAA"}}
