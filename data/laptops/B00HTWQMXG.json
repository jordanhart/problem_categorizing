{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Happy So Far", "Author": "JLDLF", "ReviewID": "R2HAEU041PYA1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I first purchased this laptop, I did not realize that the touch screen element didn't work because I thought I had to turn it on and I focused instead on setting it up. Since I had not used a touch screen previously, except with my smartphone, it wasn't an immediate necessity. I then realized that the screen actually did not work and after working with Asus customer service, it was determined that I had to send the unit in for repair, which I did. They prepaid for shipping and sending it in and getting it back took a week. They replaced the unit. Now that I have the touchscreen available to me, I love it! I am generally adverse to change but Windows 8 and the touchscreen interface is great. I upgraded immediately to Windows 8.1 although I'm not sure how much of a difference there is between the two. I really like having the functionality of both the touchscreen and traditional laptop functions of mouse and keyboard available to me. The various apps are great as well. The system is faster than I expected, although the old netbook that this unit replaced was very slow so perhaps my expectations were low. The picture quality with streaming video is quite good and the audio quality is very good as well. I like the feel of the keyboard and the mouse is responsive. I like going back and forth between using the mouse and touchscreen, depending on what I am doing. I've not yet determined the battery life so that could ultimately impact my rating. It is a little heavier than I would like but that's a minor consideration for me. For the price, this was definitely a good buy, in my opinion and I would recommend it.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "I own one, Great GNU/Linux Notebook", "Author": "Timothy M Butterworth", "ReviewID": "R2A6CYP1TBNZWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am currently writing this review on my Asus X200CA-HCL12050 with I dumped MicroTrash Windows 8 and Installed openSUSE 13.1!This is a great notebook with good solid well supported open source drivers for Linux. The Touch Screen, Special Function Buttons, Wireless, BlueTooth, WebCam all immediatly worked directly from the openSUSE x86_64 Installation DVD before even having to install updates.Using KDE Plasma Desktop Kwin works flawlessly and special effects are fast and responsive.For the price this is a nice entry level notebook, it is the lowest CPU spec of the X200CA Series so if you want more processing power then I recommend spending a little extra and picking up the i3 or Pentium version after verifying the rest of the hardware specs.The Celeron 1007U x2 1.5 GHz processor does max out quite a bit but on an up side I have not used more than 2.2 Gig of RAM so far due to the CPU bottleneck.I was able to successfully virtualize Android X86, openSUSE 12.4 with PA, Kubuntu etc with out locking up the notebook even with the small processor and even the touch screen input works with VirtualBox Guests!Bottom Line this is a great notebook to utilize with GNU/Linux if anyone is looking for one!As the touch screen is fully functional it also works well for testing/using KDE Plasma Active!", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Be weary of FALSE reviews!", "Author": "The Myth", "ReviewID": "RLHRF1BIJ3DK4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is just a note to be VERY weary of FALSE reviews here.
