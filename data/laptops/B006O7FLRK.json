{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Disappointing", "Author": "brad bohland", "ReviewID": "R377F20FWI44D7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this because I've looked at other Asus laptops with Nvidia cards that had great graphics and looked well made.  This is a little cheaper laptop than the ones I looked at, but it looks and feels a lot cheaper.  On top of that, one of the hinges on the lid was popped out and the video card didn't work.  I would probably still consider an Asus if I wanted to spend $1,000 or more, but I wouldn't buy one of their less expensive ones even in the $700 or $800 range.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "The Paul", "ReviewID": "R2O7HYZ061WDAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome computer. I've had it for 4 months now, and I'm completely happy with it. It has just the right amount of power for gaming and more than enough space for my work. It gives me minimal problems for performance, which is surprising considering all the graphically intense games I do. It never over heats, the hot air goes to the side instead of going out the bottom.It's an all around good computer and I would highly recommend it!For anti-virus I would recommend E-set 5, http://www.amazon.com/ESET-Antivirus-V-5-3-Users/dp/B005EIZ77O/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1349980720&sr;=8-1&keywords;=eset", "Date": "October 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "a key between \"P\" & \"]\" is OFF, returned & ordered it.", "Author": "923", "ReviewID": "R3DYYR2AOP3JSL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this model as Christmas gift for my kid.I'm a big fan of ASUS, using more than 10 ASUS Laptops.It is my 1st trouble with ASUS laptops.I return the defective one and ordered the same model today.Wish next one is defective free.", "Date": "December 12, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5 2450M Processor 2.6GHz\n6GB DIMM RAM\n750GB 5400RPM Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen, NVIDIA GT 610M\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "ASUS K53SD-DS51 15.6-Inch Laptop (Brown)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41XKQB40q0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006O7FLRK"}}
