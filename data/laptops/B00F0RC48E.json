I got it for 580 from staples, but i would have easily paid 650 for it (but pars with computer that sell for 800).Pros - It's a laptop for the future. It will last you the years to come (technology wise). It has the 4th gen i5 processor, 8 gigs, touch screen, and a flex hinge. All of which will most likely be standard in 3-4 years, and old in 5-6. So this laptop should run you about $100 a year. But you can get all that now for $630! Even if this thing didn't flex, it would beat all of it's competition. There is no other, aluminium, touch screen laptop, w/ 4th gen i5, and 8 gigs.- 6-7 hr battery life. (15% is one hour of use)  // Edit: The battery life has finally stableized out to 5 hours.- takes only 1 hr to charge from dead to full.-Flexes to presentation mode. (so useful, and will amaze anyone you show it to. - plus they will jump when they hear you got it sub 1000(touch still has the wow effect with computers)-Windows 8.1 with a touchscreen is fairly productive. Got rid of most of 8s kinks. There are options to make it basically like 7 if that's your thing. (watch some videos)- The keyboard is very nice. - not backlit. - but very fun to type on.- 8 gigs of ram-.87 inches. (about the width of a penny)cons-15.6 inches. For me, I would have much preferred the 14, but the deal was too good, I had to overlook this. This choice is a personal pick-I don't think the RAM is up-gradable. But you may have to double check, I'm going of rumors on this one.-The screen resolution is standard HD, not super awesome cool 2k, or 4k, like some other laptops right now (but those happen to be 900+, and this will just look like any other laptop.Overall, I looked over all the cons because the price is too good. There is no other laptop in the market that compares. The Asus vivobook wont hold against this. The Aspire v5 wont do it's charm. And apple, . .. well, you could get two of these in the price of one of those. Toshiba has promise, but too expensive as well. All of them are fine when for now, but they will be obsolete far quicker, making there price much more than this one(per year).It's only real competitors are laptops that cost around 800, and why buy one that's 800 if you can get this for much less.Bottom line: Buy this laptop, If you don't like it for any reason, don't buy anything else in the mid-price range, move up a tier to the high priced laptops. If you cant afford the high priced, come to terms with your beleifs and buy this, you just can't get more for the money.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "It has SSD hard, Perfect laptop with great features", "Author": "Ramtin", "ReviewID": "R3CV81KV83DAOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from amazon on cyber Monday. i am surprised that price is still the same, and even on cyber Monday it was cheaper than lenovo site.

They replied ASAP to all my annoying e-mails which finally ensured myself I did the right choice buying an IdeaPad Flex 15. This laptop arrived on time and safe, that`s why I`ll continue shopping from this seller and recommend JustBEST to all my friends. Thank you!!The Windows Experience test revealed 4,9 out of 10 score.It scored:  6,9 Processor,  7,6 RAM,  4,9-Desktop Graphics,  6,4-Gaming graphics,  5,9-Primary HDD.The overall performance is lowered by the Desktop Graphics performance, all the other scores vary between 5,9 and 7,6 points out of 10.It`s a slim and easy to carry ultrabook. The touchscreen is properly reacting to any touch and room illumination change, and excepting the glare I`m not accustomed with, it is very good for this money. From the big-guys-having-big-fingers-as-mine, =)) point of view, the screen it`s big enough for the majority of the common tasks required by the OS and installed programs. Just change the font and icons size from Control Panel - Personalization-Display-Change the size of all items...As a home user and a between-ages individual, I am pretty impressed by the battery. It lasted 2,5 hours continuously copying files from different partitions of an external HDD (permanent working internal HDD and also powering the externat HDD),at HIGH PERFORMANCE battery setup. I consider this as very good and I assume (not tested yet) that on Balanced/ Power Saving option (suitable for internet browsing, music listening or watching movies)it will last as advertised, for about 5 hours.I still wait for the OS stabilization, as it has the extra 8 Gb NAND Solid-State Drive (not seen in MyComputer, used by OS for fast wake-up, and not able to be used by the user) still dealing with the system`s most accessed files.The keyboard is not illuminated but looks solid and comfortable for a non - professional and normal use.It has a small AC adaptor, easy to pack and carry.The loud and clear speaker`s sound, the touchscreen and the browsing offered by Win 8, make this system almost perfect for watching movies, listening music and surfing the net while at home or waiting somewhere else...Bottom line: This is the best laptop you can buy for this money.

I found touchscreen to be the best feature on this laptop. Had it for couple of days now. 8 GB ram & 256 SSD makes it faster. Difference between i5 & i7 was $175 more. Again, kids usage made me think twice.

It is my wife's birthday present and I am setting it up. This is my first time with Windows 8.Brightness....big issue but I found out how to turn off the Windows monitoring of it so it always stays that brightest. Go to Setting...Change PC Settings located on the bottom...Power and Sleep....the top one is how to turn off Brightness automatically.  This is HUGE.So far, the computer has been fantastic. I am not a novice and this was my first time with Windows 8. I did all the Windows Updates, including 8.1 and installed Classic Shell so it looks like Windows 7. Now, it starts in Windows 8 but I rearranged the Start icons to have Classic Shell so she can utilize it either way.The sound is pretty good. Nothing special but it is only a laptop.The flipping of the monitor is fantastic. And I say that typing with the virtual keyboard laying in bed. I don't see why someone would purchase a Windows 8 computer without a touchscreen.The USB 3 port is very good. It took no time to move over her files from her old Acer.All in all, Windows 8 is shocking at first. But read a few things online and it isn't \"that\" bad. This Lenovo so far has been more than I anticipated and I am a big Lenovo fan (I purchase all the hardware at my job and everything is Lenovo).I would recommend buying this. It is fast and once you get around the screen brightness issue, the few hours I have used it...no problems whatsoever.If I remember, I will update this is a few days.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Computer for the money!", "Author": "Book Lover", "ReviewID": "R3NTBG1INWE2PH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I'm a big fan of Lenovo.  They are like the Honda or Subaru of the PC world in my opinion.  They just keep running and running.This is my fifth Lenovo, so I've had some experience with them.  You will find the PC is responsive and more than adequate for everyday use.  Love the flip top design.  It's great to share stuff, play games, or simply watch a video.....now I know what you are thinking, doesn't the keyboard get banged up on the bottom once it's flipped?  Nope.  Lenovo thinks of everything.  There are little rubber foot pads on the end in the corners and the degree of tilt still leaves the keyboard a tiny bit off the surface.It's got a nice bright big screen (but not too big) and it's a touchscreen, which in my opinion is a must for Windows 8 (as navigation is just clumsy without it).  It has an Intel Core i5 (not the i7, but still awesome and FAST)., 500gb hard drive, and 8gb of RAM!  Holy crap!  That's quite a bit for the price.....or.....you could go to Wal-Mart, pay between $400-$500 and get a piece of garbage you are ready to throw out the window in a week.Trust me, it's worth the money too.Now, more about Lenovo.  My daughter's pc seized up and I contacted Lenovo.  No problem.  I shipped it to them and it was returned in a week.....now here is the interesting part.....it was not a Lenovo problem, it was a Windows OS issue.  I think she tried to install something and it caused an issue....anyway, they reformatted the hard drive and returned it to us promptly....no charge.I could go on, but you get the Idea(Pad)", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "How is this laptop so cheap?", "Author": "Mitch Drabenstott", "ReviewID": "R25JTCSPOOQJPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a HUGE improvement over my 2 year old HP computer.

For mobile applications I would recommend the SSD as there are no moving parts. Amazon might decide to stock a version that has this feature but for now Newegg rocks. Sure, 128 gig is not that large, but I don't store a lot of things on my laptop anyway and there's an SD card slot for extra storage for a movie or two, if need be. I also got the model with the i7 processor since I tend to have multiple applications going at once, but the i5 is probably enough for most people looking to surf & check their email.The chassis is nice and light, there are enough USB ports for my uses and the keyboard comes with a number pad. The touch pad is better than I thought it would be but I like using a mouse anyway, space permitting (sometimes not possible on an airplane. The touch screen with Windows 8 is also more useful than I expected. I use Windows 8.1 on a desktop but never bothered with these features since my desktop - as with most - does not have a touch screen. I upgraded this laptop to Windows 8.1 and so far so good. One caveat for Windows 8/8.1 users is the apps available from the store sometimes are not as full featured as the web versions accessible from a browser or downloaded directly to a computer (Evernote is one example). This may change as more people start to realize the benefits of the touch screen interface.The one valid negative I've read about this laptop so far is the screen brightness. Even at the brightest setting it still could be a bit lighter. I have not tried to watch a movie with it yet but it's probably adequate, though I can see how some people might be a bit surprised it doesn't get any brighter.
