{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good notebook", "Author": "CDS", "ReviewID": "RDR2IKQZ635W6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:-User replaceable battery! Hard to find in thin notebooks.-Lots of aluminum!  Keyboard, palm rests and screen backing are all metal.-Bottom/underside is a thick plastic. Not cheap feeling at all.-Matte screen with a 1366x768 is perfect for 14 inch display.-Chicklet keyboard leaves a bit to be desired, but my desktop has a mechanical so its a bit of an adjustment. Adequate for typing.-Very easy to get to the memory and HDD bay along with the screw holding in the ODD.  Memory comes maxed out for this computer (8 gig max supported) but that is plenty for the foreseeable future.-Mouse pad is smooth, not that annoying bumpy junk lots of notebook OEM's are using.-Dimmable backlit keyboard.-Dedicated Graphics card.Cons:-Quite a bit of bloatware.  Easy to uninstall, would rather just get a disc and install what I want.-Mouse pad placement is not good for me.  My left plam/thumb keep tapping the upper left corner of the pad causing typing errors.-The mouse buttons are not good.-Pretty much I hate the mouse pad.  There, I said it.-Speakers are bad.  They are loud, but that's it.  Very tinney and hollow sounding.  No range at all. Even for laptop speakers, they have a lot of room for improvement.  Speaker placement is right under the palm rest.Overall, I am really happy with this machine.  Besides the mouse pad, its just as good in my hands as it looked on paper.  After making sure I was going to keep this computer, I immediately swapped out the HDD for an SSD I had laying around the house.  The stock HDD was really a huge bottle neck.Here is the WEI;Processor 7.1Ram 7.5Graphics 6.6Gaming Graphics 6.6", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop..", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R15RUUG3QXFES7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Researched many laptops. ASUS U47VC is the best around. I always have had great luck with my ASUS custom builds and this laptop is better than the 16\" one I previously bought and took back. You cannot upgrade memory on many others. With this you can go up to 16GB. Best laptop I have had. Im not nit picky about the sound since I have a sound bar that sits on top and sounds great. Like I said before. Alot of research went into this laptop.HD,upgradable,great chiclet backlit Keyboard. Very easy to type on.Highly reccomend this model", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent design. Lightweight. Feature rich!", "Author": "Kice", "ReviewID": "R2TBRR647YT6KV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 2nd Asus laptop in the U series line. I previously had a 2011 model #U46SV and sold it recently to my cousin for a cool $700.This review will be comparing both 2011 and 2012 models. As always with any laptop or ultrabook, I do a clean install on Win7 Pro x64 OS and installed a fresh Vertex 4 SSD 256gb I got on black friday sale!My impressions with this year's model U47VC has met higher expectations than I thought.It is slightly thinner, a bit lighter, and has extra features over last year's model.Aesthetics - I find the design of this laptop to be a major upgrade over the U46SV last year.  The battery is a lot more narrow and lighter.  Illuminated keyboard shines in the night time! Big + for me as I'm typing  this review in the night time :)  Brushed aluminum in gray this year over a silver finish. I like both whichever.  Touch pad design is neat and sleek. No separated buttons this time around.  Omission of VGA port. Finally yes! I cringed all the time, now it is gone!  Screen is anti-smudge fingerprint. Big + over last years model!  10/10 score on design and even feels like an Ultrabook. Well done Asus *Cheers*Battery - The battery lasts between 5 1/2 hrs - 6 hours. It is just about the same amount  hours I get from a full charge than last year's model.  8/10Gaming - I played Walking Dead so far on Steam. Runs great with this nvidia 620m card.  However, I jumped from a 540m last year to a 620m and wonder if this year is weaker  or nearly the same performance. This is the only sacrifice I made in getting this  U47VC laptop.  Since I don't do much gaming on the go, this area here really suffices for me.  9/10Features - This laptop has an extra USB 3.0 port oppose to only one last year. The nice  architecture about Ivy bridge is it supports USB 3.0 natively from intel.  This means no more installing third party drivers. Yes finally!  10/10Only downside to this laptop is the panel used in most laptops. TN panels have disaster viewing angles. I say enough is enough already with this low quality tech. IPS or AMVA panels are desirable.9/10 laptop score overall. It is excellent and I hopefully will keep this gem for a few years to come until I get a super slim ultrabook.Asus U47VC hits a homerun in the U series line in 2012. Again well done.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice, sleek little notebook", "Author": "Brushstroke \"Brushy\"", "ReviewID": "R2SIF9H6HOKJYK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this as an upgrade to a notebook I received for Christmas in 2010, and it's a very nice upgrade indeed. I've had some time to play with it and set it to my liking, and here are my thoughts:Pros:* Very light and thin, but it still has the RAM and storage space of a traditional full-size laptop* 8GB of RAM, expandable to 16 even though ASUS says the max is 8!* A dedicated graphics card. Not the best, but it'll do for some photo/video editing work and light gaming (can handle Portal and Team Fortress 2 just fine if that tells you anything. I don't think anything like Battlefield 3 would run at high settings though EDIT: Can play BioShock Infinite on high settings at a reasonable framerate. That should tell you it can handle just about anything you throw at it.). I should add that this laptop's cousin, the U47A-RS51, has the exact same specs minus the graphics card.* 6-cell battery, lasts a very long time. Max is about eight hours which is great.* Can easily be customized. ASUS is known for this.Cons:* The trackpad. Damn it, I hate the trackpad. You'll get used to it, but it's still kind of annoying. It can get in the way of typing at times and the multi-touch scroll is awkward for people with large hands (like me).* ASUS bloatware, but this comes with any computer. Install Windows 7 (or 8 if you prefer) from scratch and you should very nicely get around all that.All in all, great purchase. 10/10 would buy again.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Getting used to it", "Author": "Jsparks", "ReviewID": "R10XP1YD6Q7IYG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It took some getting accustomed and the mouse/cursor does jump around a lot.

Franklin", "ReviewID": "R3HLDDKR41Z1DS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Asus U47VC is perfectly positioned between the ultrabooks, which are wonderfully light but uncomfortable for real work, and the heavier-weight laptops that have all the features but are too heavy to lug around all day.  I am very happy with mine.  The only problem was that I found upgrading to Windows 8 involved  uninstalling and re-installing numerous drivers.  I wish Asus would just put a Windows 8 drivers file on their website so that you could update everything at once. [Are you listening, Asus?]Pros:  Light weight.  Great Keyboard--comfortable for work, no shallow feeling.  Optical drive, unlike ultrabooks.  Nicely sized, bright screen.  Solid Asus build.  8 gigs of RAM & fast processor.  Battery can be replaced by user, unlike ultrabooks.Cons:  Touchpad makes the cursor jumpy, but this may merely require more adjustment.  Upgrading to Windows 8 is tedious and confusing.I honestly don't know why there are so few professional reviews of this notebook out in the media.  It is a terrific, elegant design where, for a few extra ounces, you get a computer that is much more than a toy for surfing the web and sending the occasional e-mail. This is my 3rd Asus notebook, and I continue to be impressed with the thought that goes into their best products.", "Date": "January 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "What a Nightmare!", "Author": "CaliPalosVerdes", "ReviewID": "R11V7DFBFE5GXV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop in May of 2013.  The track pad didn't work properly from the outset, but I solved that problem by using a wireless mouse.  The next issue was the erratic wifi connection. I contacted tech support, and that problem  was only partially solved.  In November, 2013, when I attempted to start the computer, it completely crashed!  The operating system wouldn't load.  When I contacted tech support, they had me try two different methods of fixing the computer.  Both failed.  I lost all of my data and just mailed the laptop to the Asus repair facility.  This Asus laptop is only 6 months old.

It's very clean looking with great graphics card so I can finally play games on my computer. It's lightweight so I can carry it around everywhere but is still powerful enough to run what I need.Pros:--Lightweight, compared to my old dell.--Size (14.1'' diagonal). Perfect to carry around school but big enough to still immerse yourself in games.--Everything else not mentioned in cons.Cons:--That is doesn't come with Microsoft office.--The speakers. They are under the front of the computer. So the sound has to bounce off a hard surface to sound good. This  doesn't bother me that much since I usually have my head phones in.--I wish the screen tilted back farther so the keyboard and the screen would be in the same plane.*******Looking at other reviews for this computer, everyone hates the track pad. Most people say it's twitchy and doesn't work. I have not found this to be the case. It is much more sensitive than my old computer, but that's usually a good thing. The two finger scrolling works wonderfully. The only thing I'm not used to is being able to zoom with the track pad, so I keep ending up with huge icons, but I think I will just disable this feature.Overall, this is exactly what I wanted.Hope this helped.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "The issue of the keyboard and text that jumps around is so annoying that it's not worth its price!", "Author": "Jill", "ReviewID": "R30N5K9CPM45NB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I read the reviews before buying this and kind of blew off the part about the sensitivity of the keyboard and mouse and how text would suddenly be in different spots than I intended because the cursor seems to mysteriously reposition itself.  I wish I hadn't!  It's such a nuisance!  I'm a fast typist who can look elsewhere while typing, but not with this!  Suddenly, a large chunk of text will be highlighted and my next key stroke will delete an entire paragraph or section of whatever I'm writing.  So as a laptop, it's a major pain.  If I need to write something far more important than email or if I need to transcribe stuff, I will sit at my desk and plug into an external keyboard and mouse to save myself from this aggravation.  Mind you -- the mouse pad on this laptop doesn't even need to be touched or grazed -- I don't know if it's sensitive to movement just above it or what.  But no -- I would not buy this again!  I can't even speak to the other features which I guess are fine because this keyboard thing is a deal-breaker for me!  I don't upgrade my computers often due to the cost, and now I just spent $800+ on something I am highly disappointed with.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Powerful Lightweight Laptop", "Author": "srtalukdar", "ReviewID": "R18PTGB78BNAXR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used a number of laptops of this model. First, got one for myself and then found it so good that I recommended it to my friends and they also got the same model.Pros:Weight: At 4.2 lbs this computer is not the lightest but it is quite portable. With this configuration, if you are expecting some real performance then please don't go for the ultra-portables. They are just joke! This computer is no joke. It's meant for serious computation.Screen: The screen is extremely bright and vivid in colors. The matte screen ensures that you get to see the video, and not your own face. I hate those glossy screens because of self reflection. But this one with its matte screen simply is great!Graphics: Dedicated NVIDIA graphics make you feel that it's special.Keyboard: Backlit, chicklet keyboard. The best thing I liked about the keyboard is that it has separate Home and End buttons. One important factor is the up/down scroll buttons. They are separate and nicely spaced unlike some other laptops in which these are so tiny that you end up pressing one in stead of the other!Speaker: Very loud and clear sound.It has DVD drive. So unlike other lightweight laptops, you are not handicapped with this one.Overall, it's a power packed compact laptop.
