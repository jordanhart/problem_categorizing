Wow, my office think-pad can't even resume from sleep that quick.* No nonsense pre-installed crap. Nice and clean right out of the box.* Liked the quality of webcam.* Speakers are good, definitely powerful/better than two think-pads I own.Cons:* Had some minor issues with trackpad initially but after installing the new driver, its running fine.* There is no VGA or ethernet port on this machine.* No backlit keyboard (my biggest complaint)* If I am not wrong, memory is limited to 4GB and can't be upgraded.Overall, very happy with the laptop and Amazon service.Update:======I have been using this laptop for last 2 months. I have to say this is an amazing laptop. After coming back home, I hate to touch my Lenovo office laptop. I may in-fact buy one more for office and return the office laptop back to my employer. This laptop is about screen + weight + performance and at 599 I couldn't ask for more.Regarding keyboard, I agree there is some issue with it but its like 1-2 misses in 1000 keystrokes. I have linux installed on it as VM and I do write code everyday using this laptop. I love coding directly on this laptop so much that I stopped using my external 24 inch monitor/keyboard/mouse setup. I don't get why others are making so much fuss about it, may be its my typing style.If I would have to rate this laptop again, I would upgrade it to 5 stars.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Laptop Ruined By One Major Defect", "Author": "Nathan F", "ReviewID": "R39VTH7FUWYOCI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Note: Read on for some tips if you are interested in doing a Window 7 install.This Ultrabook could have been perfect, but unfortunately has a major defect that makes me not recommend it. I'll start with the good, however. As for as laptops go, it is ridiculously thin and light, almost bordering on too thin. (It is ever so slightly difficult to open; you almost have to use your finger nails.) And unlike the netbooks of yesteryear, it flies. Windows 8 boots in about 5 seconds from a cold start. Its Toshiba SSD has 400+ MB/s sequential read/write speeds, and great random read/write as well. Overall, it's very enjoyable to use, and subjectively feels very fast. The 1600x900 screen is excellent resolution wise, though it is glossy, and exhibits some vertical \"screen door\" effect that a lot of new laptops seem to have.From a hardware standpoint, Vizio gets major points for making an extremely accessible system. Just remove a number of torx screws on the base, and the bottom half of the case practically falls off revealing access to everything. There is no glue or harrowing plastic clips to deal with. RAM is soldered on and not upgradable (boo!) but the wireless card and SSD are. Unlike the 11.6 Asus Vivobook I looked at recently, the wireless card has two antennas instead of just one. The SSD is mSATA. The power jack is a separate board attached to the mainboard by a detachable cable, so breaking the jack does not necessarily mean junking the system. (Though, good luck finding the part anywhere...)Now for some of the so-so. As far as general driver availability goes, Vizio is showing just how young they are to the PC market. They have no BIOS updates available for any of their systems, and they also do not have any Vizio specific utilities and drivers for download, such as the Fn key / OSD utility. (See below for their response to this.) The way they provide drivers is probably the worst I have ever seen. Each driver is an EXE, which is a Vizio wrapper of the actual manufacturer's installer. This is not too uncommon. But rather than just extracting the mfg's installer, the Visio wrapper actually installs each and every mfg installer to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VIZIO\\My Product Name, complete with an Add/remove programs reference for every driver before you've actually installed anything. These are somewhat minor issues, but are still a tad on the annoying side.So what could ruin an otherwise decently favorable laptop? One word: the keyboard. Typing on this in any serious capacity is an exercise in frustration. Firstly, missed key presses abound. In fact, if you push very lightly on purpose, you can make any key depress and \"click\" but not actually register a press. This should be impossible on a well designed keyboard; any key that is depressed, no matter how lightly, should always register. Second, mysterious double presses occur far more frequently than random chance would allow. That seems to contradict the first issue, but somehow Vizio used their incredible engineering capabilities to create a keyboard that is both not sensitive enough and too sensitive.Overall it is a slick system with a lot going for it, but the keyboard is bad enough that I would recommend looking elsewhere for an Ultrabook if you do any serious typing.Windows 7 Notes: I did a successful fresh install of Windows 7 on this system, but ran into some issues along the way. First of all, they do provide Windows 7 drivers on their site, but they neglect to mention that the Win 7 model of this laptop has slightly different hardware from the Windows 8 version, even though it has the same model number. For instance, you need to get the touch pad driver straight from Synaptic, as the Win7 driver on Vizio.com is for a different manufacturer's touch pad, and the Win8 driver does not contain bundled Win7 drivers.The Intel rapid start technology driver is also a pain to get working. I'll post a link in the comments to a Dell PDF that shows what you need to do to get it installed. In short, you need to use diskpart to create a hibernation partition, otherwise the Intel installer will say your system does not meet requirements. The Vizio provided driver also does not work, and again I had to go to the mfg's website (Intel).Finally, as I mentioned earlier, Vizio does not provide any Vizio-specific utilities or drivers on their site as far as I can see, so that means I was not able to find a Fn key / OSD utility. Thankfully the brightness and volume keys work, but the key to disable the wifi or switch to an external monitor do not work, and there is no OSD or any of the keys. Not a big deal, but worth mentioning. I just wrote Vizio support, and will report back what they say.UPDATE: I wrote an e-mail to Visio support on the keyboard and driver issue, and here is their response:--------Dear Valued Customer,Thank you for contacting VIZIO PC support, I can definitely assist you with your inquiry.You'll need to press the keys all the way down for the keyboard to register a keystroke, you can also adjust the sensitivity of the keyboard in the keyboard's properties by clicking on Start, then in the search field type in Keyboard and open the properties window. If you have installed a version of Windows 7 that is not the VIZIO image of Windows 7 Home Premium the driver for the function keys will not work.If you need any additional assistance feel free to contact VIZIO at 1-877-878-4946 or chat with us at [...]Thanks and have a great day!Kali Lewis--------So unlike every other PC mfg on the planet, you have to use their image to install because they cannot be bothered to provide all the drivers that are necessary to operate their product. Is that not the point of providing drivers in the first place? The bit about pressing the keys down all the way is really a joke, as is the helpful tip to adjust sensitivity in the control panel. (There is no such ability. You can adjust the repeat rate, but that has nothing to do with key sensitivity) Needless to say, this will be my first and last Vizio PC.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Linux ultrabook", "Author": "W1ll1am", "ReviewID": "R7IWC6N3B5K3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i gave it 5 stars because I can't give it 4.5 but it is better than a 4.The only issue is keyboard related sometimes key presses are missed sometimes there are double taps.

As of now i dont have any problems at all with the keyboard, it works as expected and i can type as good as with any other laptop.-Available ports, well i suppose most of the buyers weighed in the pros and cons, including the specs.Pros-Very good design, probably the best design of all Windows laptops-Screen is gorgeous-Runs very fast-Very very good price since this is an older modelCons-Track pad needed a driver update before it worked properly-Keyboard not backlit-A bit hard to pen the lid, lets see if this improves over timeAt the current prices, this laptop is a steal. After updating the drivers it turns out to be a very good laptop. The complaints regarding the keyboard and ports boils down to personal preference.

DON'T buy any Vizio!!!", "Author": "SeeAutoRun", "ReviewID": "RCLFJHITIXJQD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After owning this computer for about 4 months and dealing with Vizio customer service for multiple issues, I have to warn folks not to buy this computer.  I never provide feedback on products, but I'm so ticked-off with Vizio and myself for buying this clunker that I felt I had to warn others.  I've had many issues from the get-go; however, the primary one that I know others have experienced is the keyboard repeating multiple keystrokes for a single depression of the key.  This will drive you insane!  It isn't something you notice right away as you figure you are making the error, but after owning the computer for a few months, I am now certain the keyboard is defective.  I've done the research and I've seen others state the same problem.  I contacted Vizio and they blame the software - I've changed every setting every which way, the problem doesn't go away!  So, don't buy one.  From what I gather, all of Vizio's ultrabooks use this same keyboard, so don't go thinking you will escape the problem.  Also, I'd like you all to be aware of my experiences with Vizio's customer service - they claim they are concerned and different than others (they do speak clear English which is nice - I'll give them that).  However, their customer service is also terrible.  If they were to do the right thing, they would just take this computer back and give me my money back.  I thought I was so smart and that I would save a couple hundred (it was either this or the ASUS) - what and idiot I was.  Save yourself the headache, get something else.

I don't regret my decision, you get a lot for the money.  Notably a nice sized SSD and high resolution screen.  Windows 8 is OK,  a bit of a learning curve from W7, but have gotten used to the changes.  I've used the laptop now for a week, my first impressions are listed below.The Good:-Feels solid, heavy, but still very slim.  Nicely designed.-Very fast for my use.  Boot up, web browsing, excel, email, ect.-Screen.  High resolution, very bright.  Exceeded expectations.The Bad(feedback for the prod dev people at Vizio):-Hard to Open.  Not a deal breaker, but could be a nuisance for some.  That said, it does make it impossible to open for my 2yr and 4yr old.  An unintentional child proof feature.-Mouse pad software.  Pre-installed software stinks.  I uninstalled the Synaptics software and installed the latest version from their website.  The mousepad now works fine, not bad and not great.  Definitely room to improve overall.-Batter Life.  Ok, it's not bad, just not the 7hrs I was hoping for.  I get 4-5 hours tops with avg use(browsing, some video streaming, chatting).-Keyboard.  Feels flimsy.  Wouldn't want to type much on this.Windows 8:-Like I said, it has a steeper learning curve than previous OS launches.  I don't care for the start screen, but once on the desktop I can essentially do everything I need.  I kind of get what Microsoft is going for here(integrating all their devices/platforms), but don't think it was done well.  Maybe I'm just resistant to change, and this will grow on me, but so far am not impressed.  Would have preferred Win7.  I won't ding the laptop's rating for this, just a consideration for future buyers.In summary, the good outweighs the bad and think this is a good machine for a casual user.

Many times, when I close my laptop when i leave, I notice that instead of going to sleep, my laptop keeps the power going... and I come home to find that it is very very hot, pretty loud, and I do not think that this can be good for my computer.  If this issue remains I wouldnt be surprised if I had to deal with overheating or even memory loss.Also, sometimes when it does this, it doesn't even allow me to turn the screen back on at all.. Instead, I have to power down by holding the power button, which we all know can be very harmful long term..

Its hard to come by 14 inch laptops with a 1600 x 900 resolution screen and stunning design especially in an ultra thin form factor. The laptop and two USB 3.0 ports, a full size HDMI port and the cooling vents are hidden beneath the screen hinges and helps it run cool and also aesthetically improves the looks. The 3rd generation Intel i5 processor and the speedy Toshiba SSD makes this ultrabook perform real snappy. Its very light to carry around a has a full aluminium alloy construction with the base comprising of a rubberized covering for extra grip and coolness.  The laptop comes with Microsoft signature which means you get a clean version of Windows with no bloatware at all. Its not an easy task to accomplish all this in such a thin and light form factor and I believe this ultrabook serves its purpose well.The Keyboard has wider and shallower keys and takes some time getting used to and the battery life is average with 4-5 hours of moderate usage. The only real complaints I have are the lack of an SD card slot and the below average responsiveness of the mouse pad. I hope Vizio comes up with better drivers to rectify this. I have used a wide variety of laptops and overall, I am impressed with this ultrabook and credit Vizio with coming up with such a product which stands out on its own considering its the company's first step into the competitive laptop market.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "minimal use", "Author": "e.j.", "ReviewID": "R37YIXNOTJMAND", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a computer I bought so that I can take it to class without breaking my back (3.4 lbs).

I bought this for college because its thin, portable, beautiful screen, and 128Gb SSD. When it first came in I was really impressed. This thing is zippy, looks great, solid aluminium build, the IPS 1600x900 screen is divine!Then came the problems. (Ill go from least critical to most annoying)Firstly the touch pad. its not bad... I know you cant expect a macbook touchpad on a PC, but this thing is just sub par. I have used a Zenbook touch pad and its much much better (or any other glass track pad) Basically, it feels cheaply constructed, its hard to push down and you have to find a sweet spot (the lower middle section) for it to click nicely. Out of the box the leftclick area was embossed into the laptop slightly and I always fear clicking it because it seems like it will get stuck one day. It feels like the same aluminum material as the body of the laptop so when moving my fingers across they tend to stick and then jump making navigating a pain at times. But whatever, its livable, not a deal breaker......if it wasn't for the keyboard. Typing papers is a pain. Basically the keys are hard to find since they are so flat, the keys don't register: you have to hit it exactly in the center and hard... but not too hard because they will register the letter TWICE! Many reviewers have outlined this issue so im not gonna go on about it, but just to reinforce this is an issue. Well, okay say your not a crazy typist and just need a laptop with a nice screen to watch youtube or stream netflix. Well your in for a nasty surprise.The WiFi goes off constantly (mine came with the Atheros card) and the update drivers do nothing to fix this. I went through support a few times, reset my PC to stock, uninstalled and re installed the drivers according to Vizio support instructions and still no luck. I finally found a fix online where you have to manually install a driver, something the average pc user probably wont know how to do, and it worked fine after. Still I think Vizio just doesn't want to admit they that are using old drivers.Ok, so by this point I'm kind of annoyed with the laptop, but I think to myself... It cant be that bad, I got it for 600$ on BF sale, that's like $300 off list price. No, what cut it for me was the fans. They go off EVERY 30 SECONDS! My CPU is at 5-15% load while browsing with 1 tab open, not even watching videos or anything, sitting in a cool room on a cool desk, and this thing idles at 55-60C which triggers the fans to go off like crazy! Even worse I take this thing to class and while taking notes on the little OneNote app the fans go off... and they are not quiet...In all my experience owning laptops (both thin and thick) I never had fans go off like that unless my CPU was under some serious load.So I did myself a favor and promptly returned this lovely piece of hardware and will start counting my pennies for either a macbook or a less expensive windows notebook.TO RECAPITULATEPROS:very nice screensolid aluminium bodybeautiful designCONS:sub par touch padinaccurate keyboardhard to fix WiFi problems out of boxloud fans go off every 30sec-1minuteNow if your a media junkie who just needs a nice screen to watch movies and you are technically capable of fixing the wifi issue (or if Vizio releases an official update that works) and you don't mind the sub par touchpad or keyboard nor the constantly winding fan then ... eh...no.. still cant recommend this. Even if you do spend 600$ on it like I did, its just too problematic. And you would be crazy to spend $900. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.I hope this review helps you make a better purchasing decision, I tried to be as objective yet realistic as possible in outlining the good and the bad in this product.

I contacted Amazon yesterday about the return of the laptop because I noticed a little dot on the screen that always appear. At first I thought it's dirt, but it's not. It is not really obvious, but when I watch a movie in fullscreen mode, it bothers me.What I liked:The laptop is really light! Easy to carry around.It is very quick to turn on the laptop as well as turn it off! Just like it advertised.The picture quality is great compare to my older Dell inspiron.What I didn't like:The laptop came with the new Windows 8 which I've now used for about a month. It's terrible compare to Window 7! More difficult to use!The sound quality of the speaker is just so so. I have to plug in my own speaker most of the time when I watch movies and listen to music.The laptop is hard to open, like some have noted, I have to use my fignernail to open it since it's closed tight.The most frustrating part is, like many others have complained, the keyboard. It's a shame that they made such a crappy keyboard on a overall good quality laptop. It often gives me more letters when I type, or the letter I type doesn't show up. It's frustrating!

It is VERY thin, I can carry it like a folder.  It boots in <10 seconds and shuts down in <4 seconds.  It is very stylish- it looks a lot like a Macbook Air, except with a logo that no one will recognize.  It has exactly the ports I use- and nothing more.  Some people might miss having an integrated SD card reader, VGA, or a CD drive.  The keyboard is a little different, you have to stretch a little more than normal for the shift key, and the up/down arrows are half size.  However, the keyboard is not a deal breaker by any means for me.  It is not as good as the Dell XPS 15 or Inspiron 15 laptops I have used, but better than my Asus G53SX keyboard.  After one week, I am completely used to it.  I bought this from Microsoft, so it came with nothing installed, except skype and windows 8 apps.  Microsoft office had a button on start, prompted me for an activation code, then installed.Like other reviewers say, the touchpad isn't very good.  I have never owned a laptop with a touchpad I loved, but this one doesn't cut it- I just carry a mouse now (though this is the OS's fault).  Where the touchpad fails is clicking.  Left clicking occasionally gets stuck down and I have to tug on it to get it out from under the edge of the laptop.  I am not used to the integrated click buttons and touchpad, so I often end up zooming when I try to move the mouse with my finger still on the click area.  Also, right clicking is often mistaken for left clicking since it's one integrated thing, which is especially annoying in Windows 8- bringing me to my final point.  Windows 8 is horrendous without a touchscreen.  I haven't had any experience with Windows 8 before buying this laptop, and I came in open minded.  Windows 8 is very fast, but with this laptop, it is a downgrade from 7.  If this laptop had a touchscreen, maybe Windows 8 would be usable, but with this sub-par touchpad you will spend longer complaining than you will doing work.  Gestures work about 1/5 times, once you get used to them.  If you accidentally left click trying to right click, be ready for ~30 seconds of attempting gestures and clicking to get back to some screens.  Unless you have used Windows 8 on a computer with only a mouse (and like it), are OK with the idea of using third-party apps to make Windows 8 more mouse-friendly, or are ready to spend some time getting Windows 7 to work on this computer, I simply cannot recommend you purchase it.  If you find one that comes with Windows 7, I absolutely recommend it.  The OS's shortcomings aren't the laptop's fault.Update: After a few hours of googling some registry hacks and 3rd party apps, I've basically turned windows 8 into 7.  All \"apps\" are uninstalled, so they never go full screen and make me gesture to get back to desktop (except when I want to change PC settings).  I also found that there are no page up / page down buttons, and also no end or home buttons.  They aren't on a function key or anything, they just aren't there.  I didn't notice this until watching a movie, but the display is exceptional; 1600x900 is great for this size screen.  Also, the power cord is very long and convenient, with a 90deg bend at the computer to keep it out of your way.  People may be interested to know that Skyrim plays lag free with short load times on the lowest graphics.  I didn't try to up the settings at all.  Sure, low settings is pretty weak, but for a paper thin computer with no dedicated graphics card, I am impressed.  However, at the end of the day, I wish it was a touch screen.  For a similar (or lower) price, you can get a thin touchscreen laptop.  This will allow you to use Windows 8 to its full potential, and probably not hate it (like I do).Second Update: I simply cannot recommend this computer to anyone.  I now intend to return item.  The wifi drops every 5 minutes for 1-2 minutes.  I called vizio, explained the issue, and mailed it to them.  A week later, I got it back, and nothing has changed.  For all I know, they didn't even replace the wifi card like they said- I got no communication from them.  They obviously did not verify its functionality before returning it to me.

Overall I think this is a great thin and light and  is affordable.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Linux laptop (I mean this in a good way)", "Author": "KeepS", "ReviewID": "R3U6RQ2EJE5MTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Unlike some other possible reviewers, I primarily work on Linux so I had no intention of running Windows. For the cost, this laptop is pretty sweet. Keyboard doesn't light up, there are other little tchotchke items missing, but its simple, thin, light, fast and especially inexpensive. As far as I'm concerned perfect for what I do, and I like the feature choices they made. So if your planning on running Linux or any other non windows OS, here is some advice. It has the Atheros wifi, just google it and you'll see lots of issues, not just with this laptop but many ultrabooks + linux. I loaded fedora 17 first and wifi was shotty, and kept dropping so updating was a long process. I finally pulled the updates and once I did the wifi worked fine. Basically I didn't have to fix anything, pretty much everything worked once I went to the more recent kernel. I'm guessing Ubuntu is also gonna work fine. It doesn't come with any media so back up your disk or at least grab your product key(download belarc advisor before you reload), its not printed anywhere on the case. create a Linux USB install disk, power it off. When you power it on you have to hit f2 like crazy, took me about 10 tries (called support, they were american and super helpful, not that you have to be american but they spoke English perfect and were on the level with how to get into bios and set it to load another OS, not like other support where I felt like I was talking crazy with simple questions), modify the bios to support virtualization and boot to usb first, after that it loaded up and works without a hitch. I Also have windows running in a KVM guest in case I need to run something windows related, which also worked great.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful laptop ruined by few flaws", "Author": "Bee", "ReviewID": "R20JNP8PPD7VUG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Overall very solid build quality.  Can be bit of a challenge to open the lid.  Mediocre battery life.  Trackpad is decent with the latest driver update from the Vizio's website. 1600x900 display is gorgeous.The keyboard can definitely use some MAJOR improvement.  If you type a lot on your computer, the keyboard will turn you off. The keyboard is a deal breaker if comfort and accuracy is important to you.  I ended up returning mine due to some keystrokes not being registered.  Vizio better do some homework on this keyboard for their next release.This would have been best bang for the buck ultrabook if it wasn't for the keyboard.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009PJHE4W"}}
