Like other people have stated the specs on this thing put it out in front of many of the other laptops on the market in this price range.  I looked at a ton of different laptops before settling on this one.  I agree with the windows 8 comment.  The laptop hardware wise can keep up with it and it runs fine, however Windows 8 itself sucks with anything that doesn't have a touchscreen IMO.  The OS is really meant for phones, tablets and laptops with a touchscreen.  I still can't figure out what MS was thinking forcing this interface on users who are running desktops and non touchscreen devices.  Scrolling sideways with a track pad is not very user friendly.  I upgraded to 8.1 preview and although it helps a little it is still not a fun experience.  That being said I wiped the laptop clean and installed Windows 7 Ultimate and Kali Linux in a dual boot configuration.  If you plan on doing this, you will have to change some bios settings, but other than that it is pretty easy to accomplish.  I have done some gaming on it and I was amazed how well everything played.  Games like BF3, Crysis 2, Torchlight 2 all ran without a hitch and at good frame rates.  The laptop does get a little toasty after long periods of time, mainly when gaming.  I would recommend this machine to anyone who is on a budget and wants a fast and capable laptop.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "liked it so much, I bought a second one", "Author": "S.

The son's laptop died, so I started the search.  This machine was SUCH a better machine then anything else I saw in this price range that I really thought Amazon must have been wrong. No other internet retailer had this laptop with the A10, a better/newer processor.  And the machine comes with more RAM, and a larger hard drive that all of the comparable laptops.Anyway, the laptop arrived, and it is a WONDERFUL machine and everything Amazon stated in their ad.Yes, it is Windows 8, but get real folks, unless you want old hardware, anything new is going to come with Windows 8.  Hopefully when 8.1 is released in October, Microsoft will have resolved some of the more annoying things about 8.So, today, I ordered a second machine to replace the wife's old Dell.P.S. Amazon, if you read this, please tell your packers to put some bubble wrap UNDER the laptop box as well as on top.  The laptop box was directly against the bottom of the external shipping box.  Fortunately, Lenovo's packaging was good enough to keep the machine safe.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best laptop for its value", "Author": "Robert", "ReviewID": "R2GHEIBO54B576", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly the greatest laptop I have owned in the last 7 years since my first laptop. The A10 processor breezes through what I do with ease. The graphics are amazing for the games I play on it (Mass effect 3, LoL, battlefield 4) and it runs most others with relative ease, granted some better than other.The battery life tends to be a solid 5 hours, give or take usage, screen and sound are great considering the specs and price. Best webcam i've used on a laptop built in. Does get toasty when gaming, but I find taking the battery out while it is plugged in for gaming fixes that.Windows 8, runs fine, 8.1 ran better. I know people have a hate for windows 8, but i love it.I have only 2 complaints:first is the hard drive, slow 5400 rpm, bad. but That is pretty common so its not a huge complaint, just something ill fix with an SSD in the future.2nd is with microsoft, mostly due to them not really giving a proper tutorial on how to use windows 8. While I love windows 8, they did not make it easier for those not so tech savvy to grasp it quickly and typically will use it for a day, quit, and complain. Though once you get the hang of 8, it runs like a breeze and personally better than 7.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!

In my wait of a solution I tried some games (Because I bought this laptop for playing occasionally) I played Call of Duty: Black Ops II And NFS Most Wanted And I should say! The Games run perfectly! No lags! I also tried the Wii emulator and works fine. The screen is not the best of the world but even is the worst! I can say the same of the speakers. You can free update it to Windows 8.1After a Loooong time of waiting,(December 20) the solution was available, It was a simple update of the BIOS I updated it from V. 1.2 To 2.05 And it just take 4mins. And of course the problem is gone :D I was happy to cannot return it to Amazon because since the update the laptop works better.I will gave you all the Windows experience index:Processor AMD A10-5750M APU with Radeon(tm) HD Graphics - 6.5Memory (RAM) 6.00 GB - 7.2Graphics AMD Radeon HD 8650G - 6.7Gaming graphics 3175 MB Total available graphics memory - 6.7Primary hard disk 718GB Free (892GB Total) - 5.9If You see the Hard disk drive has the poor qualification, but 5.9 is not even terrible, another possibly reason of that punctuation could be that the \"Hard disk power saver\" was enabled. And of course if you want to speed up the computer you can change the unit for a SSD. Also the RAM can be upgraded to 16GB.And this is the Graphics information:Display adapter type AMD Radeon HD 8650G  Total available graphics memory 3175 MB  Dedicated graphics memory 768 MB  Shared system memory 2407 MB  Primary monitor resolution 1366x768  DirectX version DirectX 11 or betterThis laptop fits all MY requirements with the stock hardware, I will use it to university next year and I'm very sure it will works perfect!

My last two laptops were HPs and while I looked at quite a few of them, I kept coming back to this one as it was a lot of computer for the money.Windows 8 took a bit of getting used to but I think anyone with a smartphone can get around Windows 8. The biggest thing was finding everyday work things that aren't where they are in Windows 7! But that is the OS, not the computer.I like the bigger hard drive. While outside hard drives are commonplace and an easy storage solution, I live in a very small cottage and space is premium.My biggest disappointment is the battery life. The product description says that this model has five hours of battery life. It doesn't. It barely has 3.

It boots in half the time my other Windows 7 laptop does, and in regards to people complaining about Windows 8.1, I love it. You don't have to use the start menu that is preferred by a touch screen user. You can simply boot it to desktop mode and keep it that way. Simple and easy, those who complain without trying this are idiotic. Windows 8.1 runs all programs at about a 15% increased performance.

I've been using it for a couple of weeks with no *major* snags or problems, and for the price I paid ($500) it's a very good deal. There are, however, a few annoying minor issues I've encountered so far.One thing is the battery and battery life. Obviously the battery doesn't last as long as the maker claims (that's kind of--sadly--to be expected); it lasts about 3/3.5 hours when I'm just running normal processes like searching the internet and writing a document. But besides the battery not lasting the claimed amount of time, the computer also doesn't READ the battery properly. Currently my battery says it has \"74hr 43min (78%) remaining\". Half an hour ago it said it had 80-something hours (89%) remaining. The percentage seems to be about right, but the time estimate it gives me is obviously...a little off.The keyboard is decent, normal, has a number pad and everything, but it flexes more than normal when you press on it. The keys also aren't very responsive, so you have to press hard on them to get them to work consistently. The computer came with a basic document-writing program, but NOT Microsoft, so if you need things like Excel and Powerpoint you'll have to get it yourself. This computer also runs on Windows 8, which, compared to Windows 7, is not a very user-friendly interface. For instance Windows 8 lacks the \"Start\" button at the bottom-left corner of the screen, and comes pre-loaded with lots of mostly-unnecessary Apps that you have to sift through in order to find what you really need. If you're not very tech-savvy, it could take you a while to figure out what's going on.Oh yeah, lastly: the camera quality is decent, as is the speaker quality, and the monitor picture quality. However, this computer doesn't seem to have come with a built-in microphone (or if it has one, mine isn't functioning) so if you want to do things like Skype with people or do anything else that requires audio input, you'll have to get a mic.That's pretty much it for the \"bad stuff\" that I've noticed. On the good side, processing power is absolutely fine for what I need (would not recommend this as a gaming computer, but I mostly just type documents, listen to music and surf the internet, and I have had NO problems doing any of that). The computer also has a fairly quick start-up. For the price tag, the processing power is excellent, and the other problems are just matters of personal preference or annoyance (or, in the case of the computer misreading the battery, I'm pretty sure that's an isolated bug).Overall, if you're looking for a basic home or light-office-work computer on a budget, this does its job and is not likely to freeze up or break down on you. If you want more than that: I'd suggest expanding your budget.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid laptop for the money - decent for mid-range gaming too!", "Author": "Patty OBrien Novak", "ReviewID": "RTKO63D3UG8TN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this Lenovo!  We looked for a laptop for my children for a year.  We wanted to balance cost with some advanced gaming attributes.  After much research, we came to learn which graphics cards were in our price range.  The processor and graphics card in this Lenovo are such a good deal compared to what's out there.  And we love the keyboard - typing is much lower effort than some of the laptop keyboards out there.  When typing longer papers (which is one of the reasons for a laptop for my kids), keyboard ergonomics have an impact.  This laptop will meet our needs for several years to come.

One of the reasons I bought the 505s is because it has the A10-5750M Richland APU which is the only one to natively support faster 1866 memory. The laptop ships with 1600 memory, which is fine, but before I bought the faster memory I asked Lenovo if the 505s would support it, or if it would just default it back to 1600. The answer? 1600. So at least I didn't waste $80 on memory, but massive disappointment in this inexcusable lack of support. Hope this can be fixed with a BIOS update. Also sidenote: I loathe UEFI BIOS. Completely unnecessary and no \"F12\" or \"DEL\" option to enter to BIOS... you have to deliberately press the little button. It's the answer to a question no one asked.I digress...  Build quality is pretty good. Only slight flexing in the bottom/middle of the keyboard. Otherwise pretty solid. Battery life is also pretty good. I miss K10stat though for max undervolting.. The lack of a FN Lock key is puzzling, especially because the hotkeys are set on by default and you have to hold the Fn key to access F1-F12Finally, Windows 8 is terrible but that is another story.

It runs much slower and takes a lot longer to wake up. I'm not a fan of how the keys press down when typing and the scroll pad is way too wide so when I'm typing sometimes the side of my hand hits it and puts my cursor in a different place, screwing up what I was doing.

This laptop is mainly used as a portable machine for school purposes such as Microsoft Word, Powerpoint, .pdf files, and so on. Nothing heavy.I did my research. This laptop was the best specification-wise compared to other laptops with similar specifications. I was impressed, and I wanted this laptop, so I bought it.This laptop comes with an AMD A10-5750M APU 2.50 GHz, 6.00 GB RAM, 64-bit Windows 8, AMD Radeon HD 8650 graphics, and 1 TB of storage.Not too shabby for the price range; however, this is not a high-quality laptop.Right out of the box, some of the keys on the keyboard are uneven, either low on one end or high on the other, which makes the key harder to press. Not to mention having uneven keys on a new laptop out of the box causing the emotional effect that you just bought something new that already has problems.Secondly, the screen borderlines on almost worthless. There was a review online that said the screen quality was the worst out of the bunch when compared to other laptops this price range; however, I ignored this thinking it wouldn't be that big of a deal since the price was so low. If you look closely enough, you can actually see the pixels. The screen actually looks fuzzy when you look close enough.Thirdly, the performance feels sub-par for a machine with this hardware in it. There were some other reviews on Amazon, before I even purchased this, that were saying the performance was low when they benchmarked it. I ignored those reviews because I simply did not believe them with a computer having these specifications on it. This computer does perform well for most computing tasks, but It is definitely not performing on a level that it should with this processor.Fourthly, there is a problem with sleep mode when the lid is closed. Sometimes the laptop goes into sleep mode, sometimes not. I called Lenovo twice, and they went through there 123rescue.com technical support and looked through my computer. All the power settings under the basic tab and advance tabs were correct. They were set for when the lid closes the laptop goes into sleep mode. They checked windows update, claiming that the laptop was updating, which the logs says it did not update. They checked the event log which nothing showed up. I checked the wireless card settings to make sure the box, \"allow this device to wake the computer\", which was not checked. This laptop had all the most recent driver updates from AMD and Lenovo's website including BIOS and Chipset updates. Honestly, if you were to just shut the computer off when you are done, then this would never be a problem; however, I feel that a computer should run properly without avoiding certain techniques.Fifthly, the case has a lot of flex to it. It feels cheap. If you are buying this laptop to carry around for school, work, or any portable uses, it is best to buy a laptop that is sturdy.Sixthly, the trackpad and the left and right click that comes with it is useless. The trackpad is rough and unresponsive. The right and left click are uneven making them unattractive and cheap looking. The right and left click is very loud making it a problem for other people in the library with me.In conclusion, I have always bought quality products such as ASUS or Sony. ASUS had a comparable laptop with an AMD A8 series-processor and was about 50 dollars more, so I turned my head to ASUS and bought this Lenovo. I made a terrible mistake. I sacrificed buying a quality brand for another brand that looked better on paper but ended up being what it is. Cheap.2.5 out of 5 Stars. Props for good specs and low price.
