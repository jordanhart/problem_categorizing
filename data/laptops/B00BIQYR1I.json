Mine came with 8GB and not the 6GB listed.  Screen is nice and bright, It is speedy and easy to use.  Setup was a breeze.  The keyboard has a really nice touch.  Not liking the Windows 8 all that much so I installed \"Classic Shell\" and it made it much easier to use and gives me time to play with Windows 8 when I have time.  Great Value for the price.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, so good", "Author": "Mira", "ReviewID": "R21GT0ZHIDGZN0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought an option with 6GB RAM, and so far it is doing good. GrAphics are good, speed is satisfactory. Battery life is less than I expected tough, realistically it lasts for about 3,5 hours. W8 is a bit annoying to get used to, but performance of this configuration is pretty good. The only downside are speakers that are really bad, but thats expected in laptops, and is a small price to pay for configuration as good as this one.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Asus K55A computer-Great buy but need time to get used to windows", "Author": "ggyghhhygg", "ReviewID": "R2PF1P553KM7TF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really like my computer however it took a while to get used to the new windows 8.  I like it but it is different and has a few quirks to get through but I figured it out.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "This computer is definitely perfect for me!", "Author": "AR904", "ReviewID": "RV5YBPQVGT3XC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i love this computer. This however does not come with the Accidental Damage Protection (which Asus told me it did so be careful. You will need a serial number to know for sure) but I spoke with the owner of the place I bought it from and he was AMAZING! He helped me so much and was really great! I would have to say I do not like Windows 8 that much though. I definitely prefer the previous Windows much better but I guess this is the future. The computer always jumps around to the start screen when I am in the middle of stuff so it is hard to like an operating system that so clearly has a mind of its own. BUT the seller advertised Windows 8 so I cant dock them points because they held up their end of the bargain.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Smooth Sailing!!", "Author": "Waldo", "ReviewID": "R3J8KDR90QLIIT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Quick shipment from supplier was excellent.  The machine is the perfect size w/good speed.  The only dislike was that the unit came with Windows 8 and upgrading was a major PAIN. Also, speakers are not very strong.
