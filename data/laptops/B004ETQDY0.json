I've taken it all over the world (literally)and used it as a desk top replacement for a full year. It just keeps chugging along, I love it.  Haven't had any major problems.  The unit looks good, build is solid enough, screen is still sharp as the day it was new and it is still very fast. The keyboard took a little getting used to since it and the mouse pad are off center due to the 10-key number pad, but that was minor and I like the key pad.  I do find the mouse pad to be a little bit sensitive, but I usually pack a wireless mouse anyway.  I surf the web using multiple tabs, run powerpoint and the entire office suite, stream videos from amazon, hulu and net flix, and occasionally do some minor gaming.  Never had any serious issues.  ONe minor eccentricity is the volume, caps lock and number lock visual flags seem to disappear after running and update. Not a big problem and they come back after a reboot. Biggest con I have is I've had issues with Skype being slow or dropping calls and sometimes WiFi connectivity problems.  Not sure I can blame the computer for that, pretty sure it was a bandwidth and/or signal issue since it seemed to occur at specific times of day when I know the local WiFi network was running at high capacity. Although other people in the same area with Macs weren't having that trouble as bad as I was.  I do maintain it well, always cased when not in used including the static dust cover, run Norton 360 to keep it free of malware and tuned up and regularly run the windows updates.  I also cleaned off all the addware that came with it right from the get-go.  Still please as punch with this machine, I've gotten more than my money's worth out of it and it acts like its ready to keep running for  several more years.  Gateway had a bad go of it for a while, but my NV55 seems to be a winner.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "She likes it.", "Author": "Stogie", "ReviewID": "R24K0XH2UIQDYE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this computer for my wife after her desktop went down.

I bought 2 of these laptops. The first lasted approx 3 weeks and then it would not operate without the cord plugged it.The second lasted only 2 days then shutdown and would not turn on.I personally will never buy a gateway product again.  My experience as stated is that this is complete junk.I had my money returned for the 1 that lasted 2 days,  but on the other it was sent out under manufacturers warranty and I am stuck with it.

First one went back 3 times and now more trouble.  Second one ker-plunk after one year.  Previously, I could talk to tech support but now you must have IMPOSSIBLY SMALL ID NUMBER before you can reach them on the phone or online. Computer #1 is an SX2851-33 and #2 is an FX 4710, but I'm going to post a one star on as many Gateway products as I have time for.  I don't know where to go from here... perhaps back to Dell, but they have troubles too.  ALSO, the SX28** is made by Acer, so stay away from them too.  I hate expensive Apple but they may be better than this...  It gripes me to see companies give up on their customers and start selling junk like this.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Gateway Laptop NV55C38U", "Author": "Franklin G.
