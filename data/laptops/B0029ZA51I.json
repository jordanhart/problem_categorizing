I returned it to the store and my only other option for the same price was this laptop. I absolutely love it! Its 100x sturdier than the Gateway and much better looking with its lightup \"HP\" symbol and cool design. Also, the performance is just as good.PROS-durability-style-speed-price-hardware-audio quality(high definition)-ports (HDMI, eSATA, VGA, USB)-comes with a remote-battery life (over 2 hours of heavy use)CONS-runs hot-seems to be a little buggy (video card driver crashes every once in a while but recovers itself after a few seconds. Reinstalling driver didn't fix the problem)-there is no program that comes with the computer or from HP that allows the webcam settings to be changed (resolution, quality, etc)Overall I LOVE this laptop though and I'm glad that I bought it regardless of its flaws.

Honestly, the HP wasn't my first choice, I wanted smaller and lighter, namely the dell latitude e4300 which is about 2 pounds lighter, 13\" and $900 more. The dv3 wasn't light enough for me to justify the extra hundred and fifty dollars I would have had to spend for a 13\" HP. When the dell failed to appear at my price range I knew I needed to make a new choice.  Having previously had a nearly indestructible Compaq, I settled for this model when I was able to get it for $50 less than the going rate (about 150 off of the initial manufacturer's recommended price)about 5 months ago; so far I haven't been disappointed. Battery life is about 3:45, about what I expected based on reviews and the always inflated advertised life. There's always a 12 cell battery available if I wanted to upgrade. On the other hand I will use it mostly plugged in since I don't see this as a \"light\" or \"portable\" laptop, IMO to qualify for that category you can't top 3.5 lbs.First the good stuff:Mine doesn't run hot at all (apparently it was a problem with some dv4 models then fixed by HP) This is HUGE as I exclusively use my laptop in my lap; my compaq ran hot, the acer was unbearable, the fujitsu was so so.I have recently taken to using a lap desk with it, and with a hard surface underneath I rarely hear the fan, even after hours of use.The biggest plus though, it has more than enough power to do anything I want it to (I am currently running 29 tabs in Firefox, something that alone would have killed my last computer, MS Word, a remote desktop connection). The Adobe CS4 tests seemed solid for this class of laptop which went a long way in selling me on this model. In the end I switched from CS4 to Lightroom so I don't need as much processor power, but it is nice to know that it is more than enough machine to handle my hobby usage.I don't expect instant boot but it is fast enough for me to turn on and pull up a document without becoming a painful wait for my client on the other end of the phone.I like the fact that the DVD is removable and an insert is provided for travel/etc to get the weight lower. My Fujitsu had this and it made a huge difference when I used the insert (I took that laptop with me everywhere, every day, so it had to be super light) I have yet to use this feature on the HP but I have yet to travel with it either.I am not a big video on PC person, but the few netflix streamed movies I've watched have been sharp and pretty with decent sound. The screen and keyboard are both comfortably sized without being huge. I love the HDMI option and the fact that the usb ports are on both the left and the right.Finally the cons:I seem to have problems with the touchpad when working in remote desktop, if a review of the dv4-1433 is correct, the pad is sensing the heat from my hands and the cursor ends up jumping around. Oddly I don't have this issue as frequently when not working remotely. The ability to turn the touchpad off adequately compensates for and solves this issue when necessary.The shiny surface of the brown version of this machine (slightly different model number) can be a major fingerprint magnet. I happened to like the white better and luckily it hides fingerprints somewhat (not as much as a matte surface machine, but way better than the brown one)", "Date": "February 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "It just keeps going", "Author": "ally", "ReviewID": "R83CWP2LSJJ87", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop right before my first semester (Fall 2009)of college for school stuff. And eventually I wanted it to replace my main computer (running Linux I was tired of the hassle). Its had its problems: the screen went out within the first year and the charger stopped charging are the big ones I can think of. But HP has a warranty for the 1st year to the screen was fixed quickly and freely! As for the charger, that was my fault this laptop has been dropped sooo many times, and a few on the charging plug while it was charging. But this problem was also fixed quickly and freely due the the extended warranty I bought. So its been almost 3 years, I'm still running vista because I didn't want to upgrade. As far as wear and tear the left/right buttons are starting to lose their metallic finish, but after 3 years of heavy daily use I think that's excusable.", "Date": "March 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good value - basic laptop", "Author": "Gabo \"Artist & Writer\"", "ReviewID": "R2L88CCGJAV8FE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My sister needed a basic laptop to run Powerpoint and use web based apps like gmail, google docs, etc. And take it on the road while making presentations to customers. A netbook was tempting but she needed the DVD unit so we chose this one instead. It is slow, but that was fixed by turning off many unnecessary Windows Vista services that just consume too much CPU power. After tweaking Vista (it took about 2 hours, you can google the term \"Tweak Windows Vista\" and get to a great site with the proper info) we manage to run it very fast. We also did a clean install of Windows XP and it works even better. At that point we got what we wanted: a Netbook with god battery life and a DVD unit all for less that $499 after rebates. For $499 a good value. For $700 it is a bit overpriced as at that price point the basic Macbook at $999 is a better option hardware wise.", "Date": "August 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "ok", "Author": "JAMES RODGERS", "ReviewID": "R2843XFZFZYCN0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product was more then I expected,only thing found bad was the battery.I was suprised too find windows 8.1 instaled.

I've had it for a year and a half now. During the first year, the computer went through a phase where it would just shut down for no reason. The sound card would also turn off intermittently, as would the sound control. The battery died the day the warranty expired. I'd been having trouble with the CD player for a while, but it would play some CD/DVD if I got lucky. I didn't use it that often. Now the CD drive is not working at all, and none of the fixes suggested in the support pages work.The cover also gets very easily scratched.", "Date": "May 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "AVOID, and also, don't believe what FRYs tells you about laptop batteries.", "Author": "Infimae", "ReviewID": "R2Z9GJK3AGNCUU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This computer gave me SO many problems. While I was pleased when I got it, this computer absolutely caused me to hate technology. I dealt with problems ranging from the soundcard to the wireless adapter to adobe flash. Better yet, over its 1 and a half year life I had to replace the hard drive, the ac adapter, battery, AND motherboard. I don't know that much about computers, but I know that's plain wrong. If you are lucky enough not to have the same problems I did, that's great. However, you'll probably still be disappointed with the meager battery life, the trackpad, and the customer support from HP.", "Date": "March 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Basic Laptop", "Author": "Eddie", "ReviewID": "R3MD9O94BSHMKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for almost a year now and it hasn't failed me once. I've never returned it or reported any problems with it. The only thing that was mildly annoying was the bright light in the back, but I covered that by sticking a Magic the gathering card on it.This laptop can handle plenty of games too. World of Warcraft on lowest settings runs 20-40 FPS, Team Fortress 2, Civ4, etc. etc. It can handle all non-graphically-intense games, which is surprising given the cheap cost and the borderline-netbook size. It can do anything most people would ever want in a laptop, while at the same time being fast and useful.Oh yes, I remember a problem I had at the beginning. My typing would always make the cursor accidently click, making it hard to type with a malpositioned cursor. Problem easily solved by disabling the touchpad and relying on a $10 USB Mouse from Walmart.", "Date": "May 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value", "Author": "degani", "ReviewID": "R30KVKCPUS2SPN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop about a month ago to be used primarily at home, but needed something that was highly portable for trips, as well as something I could use for remote work logins.  Since it is a Vista unit, we've not yet gotten all of the RDP/VPN kinks worked out, but it's just a matter or time.THE GOOD:The size and weight of the unit is perfect for portability, and while the color (white) is not my all-time favorite, it is not an unappealing color scheme.  The built-in mic and camera work flawlessly with any of the messenger-type applications I've tried.  Goodbye, plug-in webcams!  The image, too, is better than I thought it would be.  I was also concerned that the battery would jut out in the back, as many of the newer laptops do--this one does not.  I actually use it as a lap top PC--it rests on my lap as I type--so I did not want a battery configuration that would prove to be uncomfortable.  Plus, it came with *almost* all of the features I was looking for--a wealth of USB ports, webcam and mic, DVD player (with lightscribe).  Slingbox software also comes preinstalled on this unit, though you will have to purchase a slingbox if you want to use that functionality.  It also runs DVDs well.  If desired, you can use it with the included remote control (I have not).THE BAD:The biggest drawback to this unit is its battery life.  I charged the battery up fully before disconnecting the power supply initially, and have run it down fully before recharging each time, and even on \"power saver\" mode, the battery life does not reach 3 hours, though it is rated for 5+.  That is pretty disappointing, but I recognize that using the Internet with multiple applications open simultaneously does drain the battery faster. The other thing I had hoped to find on the unit was a full version of MS Office 2007.  It, like many, comes with a trial version--though there are units out there now with full versions of this product at comparable price points.THE UGLY:Aside from the issues of Vista compatibility (particularly with the RDP/VPN issue above and the \"run as administrator\" idiocy), there's not much about this laptop that falls in this category.  Plus, since this unit came with a free upgrade to Windows 7, it is hoped that that sordid Vista tale will have a happy ending.CONCLUSION:This is a compact, full-featured laptop that is very well priced.", "Date": "September 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bad Omen!", "Author": "Lola", "ReviewID": "R3OC17S24BJPGT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, how to start....The specs on this quaint little laptop are pretty nice for the price. I've never owned an HP and I was debating between the DV4-1430US and the Toshiba Satellite A505-6973. Both had similar specs, the Toshiba with a bigger hard drive. But I'm a sucker for the 14\" laptops for their mobility. I must say that I didn't actually purchase the HP from Amazon. I got it from another retailer because of a lower sale price. So, out of the box, this is an attractive little unit. Light weight yet sturdy. Basic functions are quick. I'd heard that HPs ran a bit hot and that this model was not an exception. But I didn't find it to run quite as hot as my previous laptop that is only a year old (gave it to my nephew - that's why I bought this one). Anyway, for the basics: internet, writing papers, doing some programming -  it was fine.Here's where the review goes downhill and the reason for only 2 stars.Never got a chance to really test the \"entertainment value\" of the DV4-1430US. My keyboard stopped working. Wouldn't respond to anything. Luckily, I was within the time frame to return it to the store and did so immediately. Exchanged it for another - same model. By the second day of having the new one, definitely noticed that the hard drive was running very loud. I'm an IT Systems technician for a large company and while some people may not really notice the loud hard drive, I recognized it right away as something that would wreak havoc very soon. Because I have another week to return it to the store, I've hung onto it to get a chance to \"window\" shop for another because I'm definitely not returning it for the same model. Well, guess what....? Blue Screen of Death tonight. So, I'm pretty much guessing that's my queue to figuring out whether an HP is right for me. Too bad. They have some nice looking laptops.Will probably go with the Toshiba. Amazon still has it for a nice price and I'm a big Toshiba fan. Guess I should learn to stick with what I know works.", "Date": "August 26, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0029ZA51I"}}
