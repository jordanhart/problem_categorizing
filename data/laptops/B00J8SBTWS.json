The drive that comes with it is a Toshiba 500GB drive.  Toshiba has never made a great drive that I've ever not had a problem with.  I even owned a laptop and a TV from them and I regretted both (the TV used to crash every time you used the antenna -- you know, what TVs use).Anyway, I replaced the 500GB drive with an SSD and the performance was much better.  Replaced the 2GB DDR3-L DIMM with an 8GB one..... even better.  Just to get more space, I put back in a 9mm 500GB hard drive (which actually does fit with some work even though it's meant for just a 7mm drive).But let's just say that if you're not tech savvy to do some internal upgrades, you're better off just getting a different laptop.  I also replaced the wifi module and put in a BCM970015 hardware video decoder and used a wifi USB dongle (and bluetooth one with APT-X).All I can say is that video playback is good out of the box as is (except for Flash sites -- which is why I bought the BCM970015 card).  Still, I'm happy since I bought it for $150 at Best Buy -- any other price is just not worth it.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very sad - deceptive advertising on Amazon (who'd a thunk?)", "Author": "Bill Spindler", "ReviewID": "R2ASCF0SZNPGEU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Acer Aspire V5 122P 0869 does not have a backlit keyboard despite what the advertisements for this line of computers says.

Tatum", "ReviewID": "R3JCS7LBNGYU12", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The last time I owned an Acer product, it was when Windows Vista was new.  Sadly, the unit \u2013 a full laptop with a DVD burner/reader built in, had repeated quality issues.  After getting it repaired for the second time, I dumped it on eBay for an HP laptop with the resolve that Acer needed to work on its systems, and that spending less on a system isn\u2019t always a good thing. Acer had been on my blacklist for several years.Until today. I decided to give Acer a second chance, hoping they\u2019ve learned their lesson about shoddy workmanship. Curious about the new breed of netbooks \u2013 or smaller laptops without an optical drive \u2013 I happened upon the Acer A4 1240 at a Best Buy store.  The thing that grabbed me about the unit was its price \u2013 just 250 dollars!  And it had a touch screen!With Microsoft digging its heels in with Windows 8, more and more portable computers \u2013 not tablets, mind you, but actual keyboard systems \u2013 are coming with touch screens to take advantage of Windows 8. The Acer Aspire V5 which I\u2019m reviewing this go-round is one such machine, but there are quite a few others. Before deciding on purchasing this Acer unit, I scrutinized a $329 Acer touch-screen netbook which had just 2 GB of RAM on board, and a sister unit for $399 with 4 GB of RAM.  I also eyed an HP Pavilion 10, a cute but tiny netbook at just $279.  I passed them all up, deciding to try this incredibly low-priced system.  And while the experience has been far from perfect, I would say this system will be a great deal for someone wanting an inexpensive netbook \u2013 for $250 it packs a lot.But, first things first.FIRST IMPRESSIONSThe Acer netbook I bought is a faux brushed silver which Acer calls \u201cchill silver\u201d.  It is an attractive body \u2013 the screen cover has the Acer logo on the back, and the lid looks like it will resist fingerprints nicely.Contained in the small box is the Acer unit, the power supply/charger, a standard VGA connector, and documentation.Something I will make clear here, and will repeat throughout this column \u2013 this is not a tablet like the Surface. It does not have a detachable keyboard. It is not the Surface II, either, with a sturdier keyboard which detaches. This is an actual netbook/laptop-style unit. If you are expecting to read about a tablet, please don\u2019t go on. This machine won\u2019t satisfy your needs quite that way.I say that because the unit is not light like you might expect. It\u2019s definitely lighter than my 17-inch diagonal Sony Vaio, but it is not something you\u2019ll swing around one-handed.  Having said that, this Acer does indeed feel sturdy, like it can handle just a little bit of knocking around in a backpack. And the lid/display assembly doesn\u2019t feel flimsy, either.When you open the lid of this Acer, you see a full keyboard. And it is a keyboard that\u2019s nice to the touch, which was one of the deal-closers for me on this unit. The original generation of netbooks did have functional keyboards, but they never felt \u201creal\u201d. They felt plasticky or flimsy \u2013 the Acer has a good feel to it. The vertical travel is not very deep, vaguely suggestive of a membrane with keys on top, but it works.  One issue I had with the keyboard, though \u2013 not right-side Ctrl key.  That key is filled instead with a context menu key \u2013 which most users could easily access with a right-click of their mouse key. I am hoping to find a key remapping program that will let me convert this menu key to a proper right Ctrl key because I know I\u2019m going to want that.Another small surprise is that you turn the Acer unit on from the right side rather than from a button above the keyboard area.  I would rather the power button was where it was clearly visible, but this is not a critical knock.PORTS AND SLOTSThere are a handful of ports and slots on the V5 \u2013 two USB jacks (one 2.0, one 3.0; can\u2019t tell which is which!), an audio jack (RCA 3.5mm), and (mercifully) an SD card reader.  Note that there is no microphone jack!  There is a built-in microphone, though, as well as a webcam for Skype calls and what not, but a microphone jack missing was a bit of a surprise. Again, though, this is a $250 unit!There is also a peculiar jack for which Acer gives you a special plug for standard VGA only.  There is no HDMI out on this machine. There may be something another vendor can provide to get the video signal there, but then again, this is a $250 machine. We can\u2019t expect everything, right?DISPLAYSpeaking of the display, it is 720p HD resolution, or 1366x768.  For a netbook in this price class, the picture is quite good, although (obviously) it is not \u201cretina\u201d quality. But if you\u2019re watching a 720p video or movie, you\u2019ll be pleased.The touch screen is also nice, and is pleasantly responsive.You can open the display back to about a 150-degree angle, which is nice, but not all the way flat.  Again, this is not a tablet computer.SOUNDI anticipated that the sound on the V5 would be underpowered, and I was right, but not by as much as I thought. The sound is good from the built-in speakers, but in a noisy room you\u2019ll want either headphones or external speakers.BATTERY LIFEThe V5 is rated at 3.5 hours, but other reviews online have said that may not be quite right. So far, the reviews I\u2019ve read elsewhere have expressed disappointment at the relatively short batter life of the V5 \u2013 such articles claim a couple of hours is all one might get.  But \u2013 and say it with me now \u2013 this is a $250 netbook.  If you don\u2019t spend a lot, you can\u2019t expect the moon and stars.RAM AND STORAGEAnother head turner for me with the Acer Aspire V5 is the amount of RAM that comes on board \u2013 it\u2019s 4 GB, which is a decent amount. There is a 500 GB hard drive, but don\u2019t expect the solid state type \u2013 this is your conventional 5400 rpm drive which, amazingly, is very quiet.  You might not think anything\u2019s happening!PERFORMANCEBut against the  V5, there\u2019s the heart of it all, an AMD 1.0 GHz dual-core processor.  This is not a netbook that\u2019s going to set any speed records, nor will be suitable for running CAD programs or any other memory hungry software.If you notice off the bat that the performance seems abysmal, that is not because of the machine itself; it\u2019s because of the McAfee Internet Security software bundle.  The first thing you\u2019ll want to do when you get this unit, is to uninstall the ENTIRE McAfee package and replace it with something lightweight like Avast Anti-Virus (visit www avast com to download). I didn\u2019t realize that McAfee was such an issue until I kept trying to install Word 2007 and failing time after time after time.I also noticed that McAfee was making performance jerky. Before uninstalling McAfee, playing a TV show on the built-in Netflix app showed some hesitation. But after replacing McAfee with Avast, the jerkiness stopped.NO OPTICAL DRIVESpeaking of which, the new breed of netbooks no longer come with built-in drives. With the seemingly ubiquitous USB jump drive around, you can copy files to and from your system using either of the USB ports.But what if you have legacy software on DVD or CD? What then? My advice to you would be to purchase a slimline, separate DVD burner/reader drive, self-powered by USB. I found such a drive from Samsung for about $30. Attach the drive through a USB port, let Windows install it, and then place your software disc in the drive and install that way.If you have a home network, and your base machine has an optical drive, you can add your V5 to the network, share the optical drive, and install your software that way.Finally, you can also find a utility to convert your software\u2019s disc files to an ISO, copy that to a USB jump drive, install a second utility that can read ISO files as \u201clive\u201d drives, and do the installation that way.  You will have to be creative if you want to install software from discs with this and other similar netbook units.OTHERThe only other issue that jumped out at me is the mouse pad, which is oddly wiggly.  As stated in other published reviews elsewhere, it\u2019s not as responsive as it could be, but then you have touch capability to complement it.  So there\u2019s that.FINAL VERDICTPickier netbook users or power users who want a true \u201cthin and light\u201d computer should not consider the Acer Aspire V5 unless they just want to own one of these as a backup computer, or as a curiosity. But for many other users \u2013 especially those on a budget \u2013 a $250 price point for a touch-screen system with a half-terabyte hard drive with the footprint of a piece of paper is too sweet to pass up.So at this point, I do recommend the Acer Aspire V5.  I just hope that Acer has learned its lesson about quality control.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$329.99", "Features": "AMD A-Series Dual-Core A4-1250 Processor - 1.0 GHz (1 MB Cache)\n4 GB DDR3 RAM\n500 GB Hard Drive\n11.6-Inch Touchscreen Display, AMD Radeon HD 8210 graphics\nWindows 8, 3.5-hour battery life", "Name": "Acer Aspire V5-122p-0869 11.6-inch Touchscreen Laptop (1 GHz A4-1250 A-Series processor, 4GB Ram, 500GB Hard Drive) Chill Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Np-KxxJ5L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00J8SBTWS"}}
