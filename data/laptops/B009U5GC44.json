{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Disappointing in every possible way", "Author": "Alan Mead", "ReviewID": "RLB0MA04IX5OE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Cons:  I loved my old ThinkPad but that was a while ago and if this model is representative, I won't be buying any more. I hate this model.  Windows 7 Professional doesn't seem to work well; I had a lot of trouble updating Windows.  Maybe part of the problem was one or more of the dozen additional programs installed.  Some of them might have been helpful to enterprise clients, they were just in my way.  I know this laptop is inexpensive, but brand new computers usually seem pretty fast.  This laptop did NOT. ever. seem fast.  It is often sluggish and sometimes grinds to a momentary hourglass halt for no apparent reason.  I added a 2GB RAM module and things are slightly better.  Software that works fine on other computers fails on this one.  The computer is also flimsy.  After light usage in a padded backpack, the screen is permanently damaged by scraping against the keys; apparently, the case backing the screen is not sufficiently rigid to prevent the LCD from being forced against the keyboard.  This is literally the most disappointing of the 50 or so computers I have used/owned.  I may be forced to install Linux to make it useable.Pros:  The track pointer works.  And... well, it hasn't burst into flames (yet).", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "LadyGram", "ReviewID": "R17UEETWQS07E9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Needed several updates, but very happy with this purchase.
