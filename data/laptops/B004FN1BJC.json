My main goal was a portable device to take with me to be able to work on, tether a camera on a photo shoot, take notes in meetings with clients, or show a client my portfolio.Overall, it is a really good size for me.  I used to have a 17\" laptop which became too cumbersome to lug around everywhere.I do have a few gripes... the \"a\" key has a different springy feel when pressed, and the left mouse button has a jiggle when released.  I'll see if a break in period losens these up.  I also noticed that he lid when closed has a little bit of play on the one side.  ...ok, maybe I rate it 3.5 stars.The matte black finish of the machine is very cool, and overall it is very light.", "Date": "March 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop for my needs", "Author": "Kyle O'Rourke", "ReviewID": "RMCBJ4QEFPW50", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for 3 years now and it has held up great so far. The battery life is excellent and the computer has enough grunt to get through most work. The computer runs solidworks fine as well as games fairly well. It isn't the most powerful laptop but it is certainly more than enough power for typical users and even those who need a simple workstation type computer for graphic or design work. I mainly purchased this laptop for its size and weight as I use this as a portable workstation. My only complaint would be the track-pad. The track pad itself works great but the position is a little awkward and it can be bumped when typing causing the mouse pointer to move. I normally use a mouse and disable the trackpad so this isn't too much of an issue for me. When it is time to upgrade again, I would definitely consider MSI.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Blue Screen Issue", "Author": "lot", "ReviewID": "R3HZXVSCO7PFH6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We ordered this machine because of the excellent specs for the given price point. However, we encountered blue screen issues for our first unit, and also on the second unit we ordered as replacement.The first unit worked well; but after a few hours of surfing the net, it blurted a \"blue screen\". We kept the machine for a few more days thinking that this is a legit error or conflict that will eventually be resolved by driver updates and/or windows updates. The blue screen, however, continued to hound the machine and has appeared intermittently for two weeks. We decided to return the item for a replacement for the same item.The second machine (replacement unit) arrived and we were quite happy of the fast turnaround (three days shipping is awesome). We opened the package, seated the battery in place and turned on the machine for some testing. After only a few minutes of surfing the internet, we were shocked to see the same blue screen (no time to check up the error codes though) on this second unit. We decided to ship this one back on the very next day; it's quite unusual to have the same blue screen issue to appear for two identical machines.We are not really sure as to what's the problem with these machines, but I guess part of our expectation is for the machine to work well out-of-the-box. I haven't heard or read too much issues with Windows 7 on a well-built machine throwing out blue screens when you haven't even installed much software into it. We were disappointed with this particular machine only FX400-062US (we previously owned an MSI U123 netbook, it never encountered issues like this) and would not want to have it anymore. We requested for a refund so we can get something that at least works with regards to specifications and common customer expectations. I hope this helps you.", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "I have FX720. A TOTAL GARBAGE.

I didn't do any upgrades and used it just as it came.  This computer was always on a desk, meaning I never carried it around or dropped it.  After only three months of using it, the CD rom drive stopped working.  I could not get it to open it even after talking to tech support rep.  I sent it to their repair center, which took literally over three weeks AFTER RECEIVING the notebook (I checked the tracking).  I got it back and CD rom is opening now but still don't use it much because it started to act funny again... I don't feel like sending it again because you can't fix a product that is built like a garbage like this one.
