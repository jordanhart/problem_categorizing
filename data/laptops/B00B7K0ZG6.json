{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Best 15.6\" Ultrabook Touchscreen at its Pricepoint", "Author": "ProfessorF", "ReviewID": "RHX1WV3R4AY0S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own three of the latest tablets/laptops and this is by far the best of the bunch in terms of balancing power, weight, and usability.  The other two laptops I own are a Microsoft Surface Pro (too dinky and unstable) and a core-i7 Dell w/ a maxed out graphics card (too big and heavy).Before I begin the technical part of my review, let me say how I use my computers.  As an information systems & digital media professor I use my computers for basic tasks like writing papers, lecturing, and presentations.  With it's 15.6 inch touchscreen, it's perfect for those.  However, as part of my research and teaching, I also use my computers for programming, 3D modeling, animation, visual effects, digital inking, and video production.My computers need to be powerful enough to not only run Microsoft Office, but Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, and Premier, as well as Autodesk Maya, and the Visual Studio programming environment.Rather than just list features I'll describe why I feel the ASUS is better than my other computers.Why the Asus is better than my Surface Pro: Both the Surface Pro and the Asus S550CA have core-i5 processors running at the same speed.  The Surface Pro has better screen resolution (1920x1080 vs 1366x768).  HOWEVER, the Surface packs 1080p into an 11 inch screen, which is too small to use especially in desktop mode where it's hard to touch the tiny icons.  I find the ASUS's 1366x768 *perfect* for selecting icons in desktop mode.  Of course the Surface Pro is more portable, but you pay for that portability.  It only has a single USB 2.0 port, whereas the ASUS has 2 USB 2.0 ports and a USB 3.0 port.  The ASUS also has a VGA port, which is still the standard when you're hooking up to projectors.  If you want to hook up to a VGA projector on the Surface, you need to buy a $40 adapter.  So to summarize, the ASUS is just as powerful, easier to use in terms of the touchscreen, and has better connectivity.Why the ASUS is better than my maxed out Dell: the Dell's too heavy and gets too hot.  Yes, when I need speed for my apps and when I want to play games I use my Dell with it's quad-i7 and discrete graphics card.  But the Asus is fast enough for all the applications I mentioned and I only notice the lack of power when I render videos & animations--not while I'm creating them.Anyway, I don't want this review to get too long. I want to end by saying that I compared the features of my Asus to other ultrabooks at the same price point like the Acers, HPs, and Lenovos, and what I found, to my surprise, was that these other ultrabooks were missing the DVD writer and the VGA port that my Asus had.  You may not need these features, but they're important for what I do.Bottom line: Highly Recommended!", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good balance of cost and quality", "Author": "Clayton James", "ReviewID": "R3NUD6RCQIO5NU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this s550 vivobook from Costco a few weeks ago. I got it from Costco because the assurance if I do not like the item, I can return it (up to 90 days, was it?).I had an HP DV6 6119wm before I Got this laptop. I purchased the HP a year ago and was so upset with the quality and lack of HP backing their own product, I actually just decided to sell it and get a new one.Things certainly changed since a year ago. Most of the laptops now are touch screen and with windows 8, which when I was at the store I had to spend about 20 minutes just trying to get used to how to navigate windows 8.  The touch screen was nice and it had 10-key which I need. It's fast enough and light with a sleek design that is not cheap looking like some laptops in this price range are.The good:Slim, light and ample amount of ports including VGAHas optical drive and card reader10-keySSD makes for SUPER fast resuming.Quiet! this laptop is very quiet and that is very nice to have.The bad:The 10 key is nearly useless because the arrow keys actually take up space within the 10-key's real estate. I REALLY hate this. The ZERO key should be horizontal and twice the size, the shift/ctrl keyes should be made smaller and the arrow keys should take up the rest of that extra space to make this a PERFECT 10 for me, but since these design mistakes are there it's just shy of that for me.The ugly:Battery life is so-so, but then when you see how big the battery is you'll know why. I don't need to be mobile and i'm almost always near an outlet but it would be nice. Perhaps I could play with the settings to increase this?The touchpad is too far to the left. It would be nice if the divider of left/right click was raised because unless I look at the pad, I often times are clicking to far to the right and end up right clicking, problems I haven't had with other laptops.The 6GB of memory is the max this line can take and that is terrible. My last year's HP DV6 I maxed out to 16gb. 6GB seems oftly small of a limitation for new hardware.In short, this laptop is a good buy for the price. You get a lot of features and I don't feel like i'm missing much.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "value for money", "Author": "Sush", "ReviewID": "RA7QUXLHKLGSE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned an Asus laptop previously (a 2007 model) and used several HP laptops in the recent past. I will be basing my review on my experiences with these and the Asus S550C.The Asus S550C looks beautiful with it's aluminum finish and is light weight. the screen is very nice and bright and colours are correct with good contrast. The touch screen is very nice and responsive. I feel the touch screen is an excellent feature to have if you are running windows 8, as the apps work beautifully with that and closing an app is easily done using the touch screen. (in case you are not familiar with win 8 apps; they do not have a close button like the windows programs, and always run fullscreen. to close an app you have to left click at the top of the screen and drag the curser to the bottom of the screen. this is not easy if you use the touchpad only.) Plus this being a laptop, you don't have to hold the screen up with one hand.The laptop is very very fast, 10 second bootup from shutdown, and 2 second wakeup from sleep. Core i5 is very powerful. 6GB RAM is more than adequate. the sound is good and loud. (Some HP have ALTEC LANSING speakers that do a better job though.). And has one USB 3 port, HDMI out port, which are all very useful.But...it is not without drawbacks either. The screen has a gloss finish and is reflective (not a major issue though). If you touch the Alumunium cover with oily hands, it will get print marks and these are really hard to remove. The camera is crap compared to HP. (this is just like the one I had in my 2007 model with poor low light performance and bad in backlit conditions.) the DVD drive open button need to be pressed quite hard to open it. The touch pad is slightly mal-aligned (probably in my copy only) and the SD card slot is under the power/charging light set and you have to tilt the laptop up to see it. And to see the SD icon you need to turn the laptop upside down (Initially I thought this was a defect in the cover until I realized it's the SD slot. the SD slot is not marked in the manual either!!!!). There is only one jack for headphone and mic. So if you have an old headset with one jack for speakers and one for the mic, you need to choose which is more important to you , or buy a new headset. The keyboard is not good. the feel of key-press is not good and sometimes the key gets half pressed and you miss a letter. the HP laptops had better tactile feedback and the keys feel more precise. I think even my old ASUS had better keys.If you can live with these limitations this laptop is a very good buy for you. It would be best for you to try out a few laptops at your local store before deciding on one. And do compare the keyboards before buying as it may be a game changer if you do a lot of typing.", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad experience", "Author": "AcAdemist", "ReviewID": "R1HINWI4D8Y420", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have purchased my ASUS S550C almost 5 months ago. It looks beautiful with touch screen and sturdy structure. But it has one big design flaw which renders this beautiful notebook completely useless. It shuts down randomly (by hardware) unexpectedly with no warning. First I thought this was a specific problem with my machine, but then it became apparent that I was not the only unlucky ASUS customer experiencing this due to a \"Northbridge\" chip design problem.ASUS maintenance did not even bother answering my emails.So now I have a beautiful notebook that I can not use it for anything serious like bank transactions because you don't know when it is going to crash. (By the way it is happening quite frequently.)My advise to you, stay away from it.My advise to ASUS, you are hurting your company reputation badly.

Only differance is that the ASUS VivoBook S550CA-DS51T 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black) has a CD/DVD drive.As far a boot speed, good. Not the quickest but not the slowest but lets remember SSD and HDD configuration instead of straight SDD drives.Keyboard layout is slightly smaller than normal but I am a 6'3, 210 lb male with large fingers and no major problem - takes a bit to get used to to using the numerical keypad and the numerical keypad keys are slight smaller and closer together than normal.Love the number of USB ports, hate notebooks with only two ports (Apple take note)!So the Pro's and Con's:Pro's:-Fast boot time from SSD-Good Memory size-Numerical keypad (for anyone in the numbers business this is key)-Bright clear screen-Touchscreen - have to keep reminding myself that I can touch the screen)!-Trackpad, actually not bad - love the vertical line on the bottom to let me know left and right sides - very smart!Con's:-Slightly smaller than normal keyboard-Screen resolution - would love to see higher resolution but understand that limits with touchscreens-Would love full SSD version.-Would love to see higher memory configurations.Basically, I keep on the leading edge of technology and when it came to looking for a slim notebook that includes everything (touchscreen, numerical keypad, SSD, slim size), this notebook was the closest on the market.Hopes this help :)", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer with a few minor issues.", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R2QXVN4EA16BD0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I fist picked up the computer after receiving it, I was like \"wow! is that it?\"  I've never had a computer this thin.  It didn't feel like a normal laptop in my hands.  I really like how thin and light it is.  The display is great.  (personally I don't need super high-definition or anything like that)  The almost edge to edge glass gives the screen a nice look.  It is definitely built to last being made almost entirely out of aluminum.  The underside is plastic but the keyboard area and top are all aluminum.  The silver aluminum around the keyboard resists marks and fingerprints wonderfully!.  The dark aluminum top is a different story.  Fingerprints easily show up when touching any part of the top.  This of course doesn't affect the performance in any way, you just have to be cleaning the top often for it to continue to look nice.  I've only had the computer for a few weeks but I give it a hard use.  I teach online, use it for entertainment, etc... basically everything.TOUCHSCREEN - If this were a windows7 computer the touchscreen would be useless, but since this comes with windows8 I love having the touchscreen!  Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but the touchscreen makes it so much easier.  Also the smart trackpad is awesome.  You have to learn the different gestures it accepts which are different from a normal laptop trackpad.  If you are used to using touchscreen phones, etc. it will be super easy and it really adds to the windows8 experience.  Having a glossy screen, it does get fingerprints on it easily, but the computer comes with a nice cloth that cleans them off in a few seconds.KEYBOARD - The keyboard is ok, nothing special.  Several other people have mentioned that sometimes you think you've pressed a letter but it doesn't show up.  This happens to me too, but less and less as I am getting used to the amount of pressure I need to apply to the keys.PERFORMANCE - The computer is decently fast.  I haven't noticed any lagging so far.  Be sure to turn off automatic updates, or it will obligate you to restart no matter what you are in the middle of doing every once in a while.  Twice while watching Hulu it restarted by itself for no apparent reason.  It hasn't done it since though, so I'm not sure what that was about.  While teaching I will have multiple programs open at the same time (blackboard collaborate, browser with up to 8 windows open, gtalk, powerpoint, word and skype) and it continues to work perfectly.  The i5 processor and 6gb ram do a great job for what I need it.COOLING - Tons of laptops have issues overheating.  My last two were HP's which had tons of problems overheating.  I'm not sure how Asus does it but this computer stays supercool!  I've never heard the fans running, even on high performance with all my programs open.  The aluminum stays cool and only sometimes will it feel slightly warm.  I love this aspect of it.SPEAKERS - The speakers are oddly positioned on the bottom of the computer.  I couldn't figure out why but, regardless they work great.  They are louder than any other laptop I've ever owned, however when turned up past 80-90 the sound quality starts to suffer a little and I think it could damage them if used often at those levels.  Where I live there is a lot of ambient noise and with my last laptop(15.6\" hp)unless it was the dead of night I would almost always have to plug in extra speaker.  Since buying this laptop I've only had to do that once or twice.I would definitely recommend this laptop to almost anybody. It's a well-built, fast performing laptop especially for this price! Windows 8 needs a review of it's own.  I don't mind it and think it has some nice features especially with the touchscreen.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Definitely work the  money. Impressive Laptop.", "Author": "Lm Nlandou-tchibindat \"Kashile\"", "ReviewID": "R1TQAJAWVNXD6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted to say that as someone who has owned multiple laptops in the past, none of them can beat this one.I was very hesitant to buy this laptop because of bad reviews on windows 8 but since I am the type of person who likes to see, test and review for herself I thought \"Hey, why not give it a try myself and if I don't like it...well what can be worse than my last laptop dying on me after only a year of use, right ?\"Pros and cons:At first I was very surprised at the finish and body of the product, it seems to be made of aluminium, this stuff seems resistant to random falls or hits, it gives the impression that it can withstand any blow (I wouldn't try to drop it on purpose though...just for the sake of finding out if it can lol).Aesthetically, the aluminium finish makes this laptop look very posh, I feel like I own a Lamborghini in the form of a laptop. The design is just plain gorgeous.The thing is, for an ultrabook I was expecting something lighter than a regular laptop but this laptop is heavy, no joke ! Compared to my previous laptops, this is the heaviest laptop I have owned (It's probably because of the aluminium finish).The other thing that pleasantly surprised me is the size of the laptop screen and bottom part, is this  laptop really a 15.6 inch laptop ? Nope, it's slightly bigger than this, I compared it to my old vaio 15.6 inch laptop and the asus is a lot bigger, the screen is wider, and the quality of the screen better.The touch-screen is so responsive and amazing, My little sister owned a lenovo touch screen laptop and because the touch wasn' very responsive I was afraid to buy a touch screen laptop but I was very pleased with the asus touch screen, I barely use the mouse now. It makes accomplishing tasks so much easier.I'm not too fond of the keyboard though on my old laptops I just had to press the keys lightly for them to respond, with this keyboard you have to somehow apply full pressure for the keys to respond, it's annoying for people like me who type quite fast because of that I like to use the on-screen keyboard instead.The speakers...when I first opened my laptop, I did not pay attention to the speakers, I like to listen to music while drawing and working, my last laptop had poor speakers not to say the least, so when I decided to put some music I was not expecting the next thing that happened. The music blasted out of the speakers so loud and clear that my little sister and I were taken aback, shocked and panicked because my mum was asleep next door and you could hear the music from miles and miles...ok, not that far but you get the point.The integrated camera is also good for a webcam, the quality is better than most laptops' webcams I have used so far.Overall, only positive things to say about this ultrabook. Asus has done great on this one.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thin and not THAT heavy...an ultrabook that has good functions.", "Author": "KIM", "ReviewID": "R664L59U8R33Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "PROS:-I am so particular with the weight, since I travel a lot, and I carry my laptop so I can do my work anytime, anywhere. I am not disappointed coz with all the functions i.e. optimal drive, and great cooling fan (no noise at all), the laptop is light as what I expected. Compared to my former one HP..its optimal drive was the culprit..making it heavy.-Cooler...battery does not overheat. I can put it on my lap, still will not make any complaints about it.-Touchscreen-easy to navigate, the glass monitor is really amazing...I am not worried w/ scratches (unless I use diamond fingernails)-Thin-I like my 15.5\" monitor..does not look big at all, but I don't have to totally constraint my eyes.CONS-Keyboard is not user friendly---I type the best I could, but I have to retype some letters...perhaps I need to key in the letter a little bit hard, than the usual way...? I prefer a soft touch keyboard-Mouse Pad---have to press harder if I want the left or right button-LAN Port does not hold the cable properly. It has to have a lock otherwise, it keeps on falling.***Overall....I give it a 4star. Maybe you think I did not go in depth with my review..which is true, because I am not a techy.

What I wish it had was better resolution, back-lit keyboard and lighter weight, but as I said it does what I bought it for beautifully and I have no problems with it.  Windows 8 apparently doesn't have native CD/DVD support so most machines don't come with them. This one does and I love to have it there and Asus has included utilities for using it. Exterior finish will not stay without fingerprint marks. I wish there was a potential to purchase Win8 Pro with the machine rather than Win8 (home), since I would like to use Win8 Hyper-V available in Pro and Enterprise only, so I will be upgrading shortly.Getting used to using Windows 8, but I still hate the crap out of it. Hoping 8.1 would resolve a lot of the hatred.  I recommend the machine to anyone but will make sure they understand the limited screen resolution, which I think is the biggest drawback, although not a deal-breaker (hence my rating of 4 stars). I suppose a higher resolution screen would have cost another $200 or so, and the question is \"would I have been willing to pay $200 more for a better resolution?\". Answer would probably be \"No\".  The thing is if you are going to use the Win8 in the Metro mode, the resolution is fine.

For instance, when you tap the pad with both fingers it is the equivalent of right-clicking the mouse.  However, this feature does not always respond on the first few trys.  Sometimes it does not respond at all and I have to click the right button on the pad.  Not a huge deal, but the product should consistently do what it is built for.2. The touchscreen has similar flaws.  For example, it doesn't always respond to the swiping action from the far left side of the screen to the right.  This action is equivalent to the alt+tab feature on windows which alternates between programs that are open.  Again, no big deal, but it should work consistently.Beyond the stated flaws, everything else is great.  The touchscreen is a great feature, the weight, dimensions, processor, 6GBs of RAM, and 500GBs of hard drive space are a great deal relative to the price.  Also, ASUS has the most consistant ratings for reliability in laptops across multiple surveys.  Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase...so far.

The touch screen is an afterthought or bandwagon feature that doesn't lend any increased capability or functionality. The angle at which you would interact is harsh and very uncomfortable (hover your hand 6 inches off the desk, and half an inch from the screen and you'll see it's awkward). In my opinion as an industrial designer with user interface/experience experience: touch screens are the new bandwagon bull stuffer feature like fingerprint readers and color screens were in the past (does your oven need a color screen? It did for a year or so when miniaturized color screens became available)The volume is controlled by a pair of buttons, \"FN\" and \"F11 or F12\". The spread between these three buttons is 7 inches. Too bad since these buttons have to be pressed at the same time. The SD card slot is located on the underside chamfer of the front end. So inserting a card often requires me to lift the laptop so I can catch that underbite of a card slot.This laptop is a mid-level market filler.

It meets and exceeds my expectations in almost every category.Pros:--The laptop itself feels fairly high quality.  I love the brushed aluminum finish on the keyboard and wrist rest.--The touchscreen is bright and colors vivid, though the viewing angle is a bit smaller than I would like.--The speed!  My old laptop was...well let's just say very old, so the speed of the processor on this ASUS is a breath of fresh air.--It is light and feels sturdy.--The battery life so far has been around 4-5 hours, this works just fine for me.--Optical DVD Burner drive was a must for me, even though they say they are on their way out.  The base of the laptop is still only around half an inch thick, even with the drive built in.--Almost no bloatwareCons:--The lid is black plastic and it is a fingerprint magnet.  I have gotten used to wiping it down with a microfiber cloth every time I pick it up.  I love the look of the laptop when it is clean and wish that using it did not immediately leave it smudged with oils from my fingers.--The trackpad mouse is not very responsive on a single or double click.  This was mentioned in several other reviews and I hoped it would not turn out the be the case, but luckily I tend to use an optical mouse and this circumvents the problem.  It becomes frustrating very quickly when the pad does not respond to taps.--The speakers are nothing special, they sound slightly tinny and occasionally muffled.--Window 8I know the Windows 8 debate is already old and tired but I have to say I have never been more disappointed with a piece of software or an Operating System in my life.  It is not intuitive and requires a pointless jumping back and forth between the \"old style\" Desktop screen and the new Apps screen.  In the beginning the design was confusing and frustrating enough for me to set aside my brand new laptop for several days (something no gadget geek ever wants to do) and now after almost a month is waning towards simple annoyance instead.  Learning the swipe tricks and other \"shortcuts\" has helped a bit, and yet I still find myself longing for Windows 7 instead.  Before purchasing and using Windows 8, I thought surely those who couldn't make it function must be older, non tech types.  I consider myself rather tech savvy and it is still more hinder than help to use this system.All in all, a few personal tweaks (optical mouse, bluetooth speakers instead of built-in, and installing Classic Shell to make Windows 8 more navigable) have taken this computer from fairly decent to great and I look forward to using it for some time.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "love this laptop!", "Author": "felicia", "ReviewID": "R2AJ3BB2WM2XMJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my laptop had broken so i had to search for a reasonable priced laptop that had everything i wanted. i wanted a thin laptop that still have a cd drive and i finally found this one ! only thing it didnt have was a finger scanner but i can live without it. this product is even touchscreen, dont use it much but its a plus ! only con i have is that the smart gesture center sometimes doesnt work when you close the laptop and reopen it so you cant scroll with the touchpad, but when you restart it, it works again !", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SL5V9DZX7GHN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Awesome product for the price touch screen works extremely well and fast booting is a plus to say the least.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Done after 5 months", "Author": "L.

It has been one problem after another, to where now I'm hesitant to even turn it on, let alone try to do any work on it. That's why I'm composing this review on my old computer.First the good:It's a good looking laptop and on first appearances seems well made. Nice keyboard. The touch screen is very smooth and with a little investigation online (not much help from ASUS or Microsoft) you can figure out how to do pretty much every thing you can do with a mouse or a touchpad.The bad:When I first opened the laptop I noticed that the bottom of the touchpad (the side closest to the user) was slightly bowed up in the middle. Upon trying to use the touchpad, I couldn't get either the left or right \"buttons\" to work at all. You can use it to move the pointer around the screen and to double-click icons, but there's no way it can be used to access context sensitive menus that can only be reached with a right-click.The worst part is it repeatedly crashes. It has crashed when using Internet Explorer, it has crashed when moving start screen tiles, it has crashed when there's no activity at all, and it has even crashed when the Charm bar \"shut down button\" is touched. By crashed I mean it just seizes up. Dead as a brick. Even Ctrl+Alt+Delete does nothing.When these crashes occur, the only way to shut down is by holding down the keyboard power button. In one instance, on restart it did a full system recovery (without warning) which took over an hour and deleted every I had done on it since taking it out of the box. Two other times it \"rebuilt the profile\" (whatever that means) which is about a 10 minute process. Then each time I would have re-download the 44 patch from Windows Update. Sometimes, but not always, after restart the McAfee antivirus would not automatically load and would have to be started in the Control Panel.I have not heard of Windows 8 being this unstable, so I assume the problem is either this particular laptop (infant mortality) or perhaps some incompatibility between this model laptop and Windows 8.This has been a most aggravating experience.I presently plan to return it to Amazon.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice computer but not good for work - Random Shutdowns", "Author": "Phillip Bruce Rittgers", "ReviewID": "R4KPSVYLC3PF4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "About once a week, out of the Blue it shuts down.
