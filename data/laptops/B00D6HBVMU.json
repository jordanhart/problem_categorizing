{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Most bang for the buck", "Author": "M. Murray \"Msquared\"", "ReviewID": "R1ORKNRUNH26KQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews, but it seems that the left hinge issue is the biggest one.  All I can say about that is if you are spending this much on a laptop these days, it would be wise to include the four square protection program.  I didn't, but may go back and correct that.  Anyway, this laptop is heavy compared to others on the market, but it's also the most powerful, and sturdy feeling that I've ever owned by far.  For laptops I've always been a Mac guy, but for less than a new Macbook Air, I can't believe I got this kind of power, and really, who can't lug around ~six pounds?  It's quiet and fast; overclocking to 3.4ghz, and I'm even starting to get used to Windows 8.  I'm actually not into heavy gaming but I do a lot of multitasking, and you won't see \"buffering\" messages on this machine as videos load up while you are working on something else immediately.  For the first time ever, I didn't need to add any upgrades to this box.  It's perfect \"as is\", other than the free disc eject app shortcut that I downloaded for the desktop.  People will say that to enjoy Windows 8 you need a touch screen, but I say that the finger pad works just fine to simulate that and keeps the fingerprints off your screen.  And the included port selection makes this thing totally versatile to be your source for HD monitors, blue ray players, you name it.  It also doesn't build up near the heat of my old Macbook Pro.  I'll always have a soft spot for Mac OSX, as that is a real operating system, but proprietary power cords, software, etc. gets old, not to mention the price just to get the basics.  It's too bad Atari computers, like the ST didn't hang around to keep Apple's prices down, as back then anyone who cared about graphics would never have touched a DOS based box, but that's the way the cookie crumbled. Lastly, I wanted a laptop that is going to last me three to five years as technology changes and this will do the trick with room to grow the RAM and upgrade the HDD to an SDD down the road.  Bottom line; at least to me, this is truly an excellent value and I'm happy.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love it.", "Author": "d.stuck", "ReviewID": "R2WQZ77OJZWI40", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for about a month now and I love it. I was not sold on alienware at first so thats why I waited to write a review. I'm a big fan of steam and use this laptop for what it was made for. I've seen some of the other reviews on here about the 14x which this is not. it's the new 14 inch I can't speak for the older 14x but this one works great. the only draw back I've had so far is in order to take out the battery you have to unscrew the bottom and then unscrew the battery it self. I'm a fan of popping out the battery if I'm going to be gaming for more than an hour. outside of that I would have no problem telling some one to buy this. I would make sure you get it with the blueray also it has a pretty good screen at full 1080.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it so far", "Author": "Kevin Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2MCLY0L6RKEOQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great little laptop.

Yes. Worth it? I believe so. Great speed, great build quality, looks GREAT, expertly packaged - trust me the box is something you'll never throw away - and overall, just a sound product from alienware. It's my first gaming PC, but even my roommate who tends to hate anything with big name brands like alienware, razerblade, apple, etc. can't help but admire it when running games. I won't say you can't find this kind of hardware for less, but for a quality build, sleek design, and great customer support: look no further.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing multitasking computer", "Author": "Rayne", "ReviewID": "R33GO3WSZUSAD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is AMAZING, I do a lot of mulitaking, with many many window open at a time and can have a few games running in the process and it still runs like a gem!

I started to use mine 2 weeks ago and the hand rest area already shows the marks of my hands like if I had used the computer for some years.Again, it works fine but when you pay more than $1,000 dollars you expect perfection in every single detail.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D6HBVMU"}}
