{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best. Laptop. Ever.", "Author": "Jon Vandergrift", "ReviewID": "RLY6OIQO8TS5E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been holding out on a laptop purchase due to my reliance on desktop systems for performance with gaming, design and audio production. In short, this is the best computer I've ever used.Pros:Out of the box, this was easily the fastest system I've ever used - Photoshop CS6 opens in 2.5 seconds. The SSD makes all the difference in the world.2GB NVIDIA graphics is adequate to run Borderlands 2.The 17\" touchscreen is great for a virtual console for audio production.Battery lasts longer than expected (around 2.5 hours)Backlit keyboard is comfortable and easy-to-type on, which is not always the case for laptops.Con:The two 1TB drives are 5400 RPM. I will most likely replace at least one with a hybrid drive. For now, I only use one for file storage and the other for Linux.In summary, I dedicated weeks researching notebooks to find my next system. This price tag on this HP Envy was more than I wanted to spend, but I don't regret one cent of it.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Can Satisfy Both your Mobile & Desktop Requirements", "Author": "J.
