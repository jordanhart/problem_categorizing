I bought it on the 21st of June, they never sent it until the 24th, and I received it on my birthday, the 25th. I didn't start using it until July 24th and I only used it for 9 days, it quit working, it wouldn't turn on, I finally got that to work by taking the battery out, then it worked  then the screen quit working, I couldn't get anything to come up, I had to do a complete reboot of the system. It worked again for a day, I didn't turn it off but just closed the lid. I opened the lid about an hour or so later and it would not turn on again, and nothing on the screen, again. The company would not give me my money back they said the 30 day warranty was not in affect. Gee how can I get the warranty up and going on it if I don't received it until 4 days after I buy it? To me the warranty started from the day that I received it. I had to send it back to ASUS to get repaired, I got it back, but this time they didn't send a battery back with it. What's wrong with this company? I'll never buy from them again.I definitely WOULD NOT recommend this company,PC Outlet. I don't blame Amazon, I'll always buy from them.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B2AODA0"}}
