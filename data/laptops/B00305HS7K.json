Right out of the box I noticed the the keyboard was very warm.  To prevent overheating I began elevating it to ensure good air flow and prevent excessive overtemp problems.I loaded StarcraftII and after playing for a very short time it just shut down, no warning - nothing.  After restarting and going back to Starcraft I noticed that the left side of the keyboard was extremely hot, too hot to touch and then it shut down again.  After several of these events, I began to get Windows file corruption errors most likely due to the improper shut downs.I called Toshiba and returned it for repair.  Unfortunately their tech ignored the overheating problem, re-imaged the drive and returned it as \"fixed\".  I had to call Toshiba again and complain about what they'd not done.  They respond by asking me to return it again.  We'll see what happens this time.The problem is mentioned on the Toshiba forums [...] though Toshiba has not admitted there could be a problem.The heat issue was also mentioned by [...]so it isn't just in our heads.I CANNOT recommend this notebook until Toshiba comes up with a viable fix.  Especially if you need it for your livelyhood, there is too much downtime if you get a bad one.  Also it's pricing needs to be reigned in.  Even if it worked properly it is currently too expensive for the features included.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor Quality Control - Horrible Toshiba Support", "Author": "C. W.

I'm knocking the way sellers on here keep raising the price of the Toshiba due to its popularity. When I 1st started looking at it and comparing it to others that I was in the market for it was only $1,899.00. Now I look and they want $2,499.00 for it. Thats $150 more than the 17\" Mac Book Pro. Its also nearly $800 more than its currently listed for on other sites, like new egg ($1,725.00) or even Toshiba itself ($1,899.00.) My advice is to simply buy this product where the seller isn't gouging the price to customers in order to get one. Nobody beats Amazon for their customer service and return policy but only 3rd party sellers are currently offering this product on here.", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Shipped a different model", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R21KN7C7VT160F", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This one-star rating is not against the product, but is posted because I was sent a totally different model and specs.  The model listed on the box I received was a Q860 and not a Q830.  There is nothing I could find on the Q860 online, so it must be a new model introduced by Toshiba.  However, this version comes with an i5 (not i7) processor and no blu-ray.  The hard drive is larger too, but that is a plus.  If these differences do not bother you then I am sure you will be happy with your purchase.  As always, Amazon provided great customer service and is providing me a full refund that includes shipping costs.", "Date": "January 8, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00305HS7K"}}
