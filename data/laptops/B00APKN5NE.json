Love IT. Has everything you need in a lightweight laptop. Plus the size and extras that you don't get with a notebook. I am very glad I made this purchase and would do it again.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very happy with the purchase", "Author": "julia gordon", "ReviewID": "RKCZUCQY1HQLO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this used and the model I got was actually a 3520 which was noted by the seller. When I got it, the physical appearance was better that I had expected. It looked new. I like the speed. It's much faster than my old laptop. The mouse pad and keyboard can be very annoying though. They're all over the place and doing own thing when I'm trying to use them. That's the only flaw I find right now. Other than that, I love this computer and I would definitely buy it even if I had known about the mouse and keyboard before. I think it was worth the price. So far so good. Hope I don't run into any issues in the long run.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Rebecca Schrader", "ReviewID": "RLDEX8KEG3GE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm in love with this laptop, I use it all day long and I don't have many problems with it.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Laptop, Not a BIG price!!!!", "Author": "holly  M", "ReviewID": "R2Y1703YFYS4BV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it!, It's the best Computer ,I  ever bought, And this is the fifth, , And also the third Laptop,, I started on a used windows 95, , Then I bought a New Dell Computer, then I bought two Laptops, Dell 600 XP, At separate  times, Then I bought this Dell Laptop from Amazon, And it's great. It came with so many Free APPS. And Freebies from the Dell Store where they have 1000's of Free APPS for any thing you can think of that  you care to read about/ or watch Free Movies with one click to the APP you care to check on another thing is that you can Save to your start window or Save to your Favorites! there are Free APPS for any kind of Movie/ TV Show/ cooking show, Close to any thing you could  ever want to Watch!  All are And All  were Dells. And  I wouldn't  ever  want  to  have to use any other Brand besides my Good Ole Dell's , People can say all they want to by  saying telling others that it's just a name EXCUSE ME!! But the Dell's are and always be on TOP!!  In  other words OUT to you men!!!, I love/ like / into my Dell Laptop as I am into my Chevy Truck And My late model Firebird, I have had my Firebird since started driving. And my Chevy Truck 84. It's Great to be able to love And trust whom you can rely on to keep you work going Smooth, And with the Dell inspiron I can see that I can do things  much faster And it's much easier And much  better using the Dell 115-1364BK, I have and will always tell people how Great the Dell inspiron, It has a shredder to shred all and any files you care for no one to see,  Heck it can even restore from factory and time you care to redo any thing on the Laptop, What more can I say?? IT'S GREAT!!!", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great computer", "Author": "mark f.", "ReviewID": "R31FFFJ01GW0Q7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife loves it.

I have had other brands of laptops, I just like Dells a little better. Now onto the software installed......Windows 8 is the most unintuitive, hard to use, impossible to figure out, complete reversal of all things \"windows\" I have ran across in all of my computer using days ! You can pick up any PC running a Windows operating system that has been made in the last 20 years and they all have the same basic mode or style of operation, Not Windows 8. Did I mention I really don't like windows 8 ???", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00APKN5NE"}}
