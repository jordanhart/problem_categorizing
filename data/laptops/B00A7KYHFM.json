{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little laptop", "Author": "Steve F \"Steve F\"", "ReviewID": "R29J9HV9KAQEJ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I replaced my 5 year old Toshiba laptop with this ASUS and have been very impressed.  I was just looking for a basic laptop for web browsing, email, Youtube, etc, and this fit the bill.  It's slim and lightweight (at least compared to the other older laptops we have) and runs very cool.  With the Intel i3 processor along with 4GB of RAM it's not cutting edge by any means, but as a basic laptop it's more than enough.I've got an ASUS netbook that's a couple of years old and have had no issues at all with it, and hopefully the new laptop will fare as well.  If you're looking for a good, basic laptop then put this on your list.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Computer!", "Author": "giddy", "ReviewID": "R1BJ7A2OS9OFXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very shocked at how well this computer runs and works.
