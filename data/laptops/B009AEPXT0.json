I kept seeing reviews about a wifi issue.. ?I do not have one. I'm about 60 feet away from my router, and my speed is like lightening.Anyone considering getting a Windows 8 pc should know to disable the gestures.It is not the laptop with the problem.. its the windows 8 software that's annoying.If you swipe the trackpad the wrong way it will pop into something else.Once I disabled the gestures, I no longer have any issues.Loving my new ultrabook YAYYYY!", "Date": "March 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "A great computer for a great price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1B6Q97GH02JWY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Edit on Feb 6, 2013: I reduced number of stars from four to three because of a small bug and lenovo has not found a solution for it yet.If you start using MS Office products, the synpatics touch pad loses its advanced ability to scroll, gestures etc. This makes scrolling very annoying. In general the touch pad program exits and does not come back until you manually restart it from the Program files or restart the computer, and then it loses the ability as soon as you start working on MS Office. There have been several complaints about it online, but it has not been resolved even in the latest update.End EditI bought it on Frys for $598. It is still expensive at most stores. This is a very light and good computer. The battery can actually last for more than 5 hours. I have still not gotten used to Windows 8 so there is no point in reviewing that. The laptop is light and doesn't get warm.", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5 3317U 1.7 GHz (3 MB Cache)\n4 GB DIMM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive, 24 GB Solid-State Drive\n13.3-Inch Screen, Intel HD 4000 Graphics\nWindows 8, 6-hour battery life", "Name": "Lenovo U310 13.3-Inch Ultrabook (Cherry Blossom Pink)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/417e0ggDHjL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009AEPXT0"}}
