It has numerous great features like built-in wifi capabilities, 512MB of memory, a highspeed processor that makes this laptop just speed along. I think its only flaws-- and minor ones too-- is the limiting 30 GB hard drive that can get filled up far too quickly and it's small screen. While 15.6 is a standard size, it can be hard to read sometimes nontheless.Yet this laptop is a great bargain for the price as is. Still, once I got it I decided to upgrade the hard drive and get a mouse to replace the sometimes troublesome pointing stick. If you need a good laptop but don't have a major budget, this is the one to get.Ron", "Date": "May 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Jacob Shumann \"\"VG freak\"\"", "ReviewID": "R30E6DA3W73XGD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good to have if you're just starting out in college.

Walcott", "ReviewID": "R1YX0MZZP0HP91", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was purchased as a sacrificial test bed for software testing.  It was presented as a VERY used item that was far from 100%, so I didn't expect a \"factory new\" product.  Yes, it looks like the heck was beat out of it before it was resold, but (for the most part), it DOES work!  Unit was also shipped with Microsoft Office and AntiVirus software (long out of date, but it did update itself on 2nd use --- 2nd use because of hardware component failure.)  Item was shipped with caveat that battery was \"feet up\", but the battery holds a charge, just that it SOMETIMES doesn't transfer energy to the motherboard (but sometimes, it does).  Ditto the internal NIC card.  It was NOT listed as defective, and (as a matter of fact) presented as fully functional.  Well, it worked the first time, and failed thereafter.  I had to purchase and use a USB adapter to access the Internet (after which, the computer sizzled and popped and the NIC card came back on line and remained for a few days before quiting again.  (I found that smacking the laptop a few times would bring the NIC back on line, because when it sizzled and popped, the computer kept re-rebooting during startup. Smacking it, stopped the sizzle/pop and often brought back the NIC (task bar showing operation of the USB adapter [running at 72Mbps] the internal adapter [when it ran, it was only 11Mbps, so commanded to be off when it did run], and the ethernet connector [which also failed when the internal adapter failed --- thus the NIC card seems to be de-laminating from the motherboard).ALSO problem was unit was presented as having a CD/DVD drive.  Uh, not quite --- unit only read CDs (and Device Manager concurred --- is NOT a component failure, but is the type of installed component), so I had to purchase a USB DVD drive to install software too big for flash drives.  Also not mentioned, is power switch is finicky.  Sometimes it works, sometimes, not so much.  Actually, when if fails, it will function if I unplug the AC power cord until it turns on and begins reboot.  Then, not trusting battery, I will re-plug the unit into AC power.OVERALL --- would I recommend as a valid laptop, or a backup unit, or a starter unit?  Heck NO Would I recommend it for the purpose for which I bought it?  Heck YES!!!  Darned good super-El-Cheapo unit for sacrificial testing --- and so far it has done what it was purchased for.  If it continues working for another 6 months like this, I could say that \"I'm In Like Flint!\" for this unit.  Would I do something like this again.  YES!!!! ((I'd use better French to emphasize my pleasure, but want to keep this as a \"family\" review)).

Other then it being little this thing is powerful. I was searching for something affordable for about 2 years in a row and never found nothing that was worth trying but when I ran across this Dell Latitude for only 120 bucks I couldn't resist.I was so nervous the day I received this big ol box by Ups . My husband just looked in shock because I always chance things and they always end up bad lol , but when I did open it and saw how clean it was with not one mark on it we both started getting excited. I then turned to him and kindly said \"we'll now that you seen mines , you better order yourself one because this one is only for my use\"! (I know mean right , but you have to understand why I said it)So going on , I  had to order 2 more the same day.I must say my whole family loves this computer. Especially my son, At night I hear him in his bed room playing music and I have to go in and tell him to turn it down(another plus it can get very loud). One night I even had to take it away from him because I knew If I didn't he would've failed his test the next day. Honestly guys/girls this is really a good purchase. If I had to say anything on a neggitive side this would be my only complaint, NO WEB CAM! That's pretty messed up but I can always go and buy one for 50 bucks . That's a small problem to a giant.

PC tech input:After taking a look at this Dell Latitude D600 I was already concerned about the price she had paid of $150.00 for a machine that is hardly worth that even in mint condition.Upon inspection of this unit I had discovered all 3 of the batteries the seller had given her were bad.  One of them even had the word BAD written in permanent marker.  She even complained about the faulty battery and they sent her another faulty battery to remedy the problem.After further inspection of the machine the internal hardware wan not as stated, product description states a 30gb HDD is included.  30gb isn't alot to begin with but is ample amount of storage for documents and a decent amount of photos and music.  This unit was equipped with a measly 20gb HDD.Furthermore the overall cosmetic condition is Par at best, they have been so kind to include some sticky pleather material on the LCD lid to cover up the huge gash and any other cosmetic blemishes you might not like.I peronally have refurbished well over 50 laptop machines in the past year and know that from a recycling facility these guys couldnt have paid more than 25-30 bucks for this unit, bought a square of pleather from JoAnnes for a dollar, jacked up the price $120 and called it a day.He is probubly some loser who lives in his moms basement for free and needed some more beer money.
