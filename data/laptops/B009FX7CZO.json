{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome laptop", "Author": "newbie", "ReviewID": "R3LOCJ6AXU3E5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There aren't many laptops on the market that can offer the ergonomics and build quality of this new XPS 15. I wanted an Ultrabook like feel/battery life, but with a larger 1080 screen and disc drive. I have never before been impressed by a Dell product, but they have clearly stepped up their game and this fit the bill perfectly.I have been using this computer for about a month now, and I honestly have 0 complaints. While this is the most basic XPS 15 offered, it still gives excellent performance. The i5 on this particular model is only dual core, but I have had no problems gaming or with any other task I have given it. Coming from a quad core AMD on my previous laptop, this processor hands down performs better, not to mention, I can usually squeeze a good 4+ hours of use out of the battery.The screen is brilliant and the fact that it is 1080p makes the 15\" screen feel like a 20\" screen when carrying out everyday tasks. If you're looking for something sleek and solid with an HD screen like--dare I say--a MacBook, look no further. Perhaps I was being picky but in looking through just about every Windows laptop currently available, this was the only one of its kind. Compare the price of this to that of a similar MacBook Pro and the XPS 15 is a clear winner. I have to agree with the other reviewer that said this laptop is worth every penny.One thing to note is that the hard drive seems to be more of an HDD/SSD hybrid drive. From what I can tell, you cannot access the 32gb SSD portion independently from the HDD portion. It will act as a single 500gb drive, but the 32gb SSD gives it some sort of \"cache\" that improves performance and boot time.UPDATE: Buyer beware. I really like this laptop but there are some well known issues with the wifi due to the aluminum. Under certain scenarios, you WILL NOT get the same throughput as you will on any other cheaper laptop. I also ended up purchasing another one of these. The 2nd unit I purchased has recently started making an incredibly annoying squeaking sound that sounds like it is coming from the hard drive.", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell XPS 15", "Author": "Chilihead \"Denny\"", "ReviewID": "R1JXB3IXPT4OL9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am extreemly impressed not only does it have beautiful graphics but super fast.

It has a RGB screen!", "Author": "Kaiyuan Shi", "ReviewID": "R2E5G77SMRIU0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Yes, a RGB screen. But it probably means nothing to people who are not nerds. Beside, you get what you paid for. DELL has started order from the major Chinese supplier of Apple, so there should be no quality issue at all.

By searching this you can find all the information that you need.Great value of the price and functionality wise too.The Screen 1080p quality is really amazing and boot time is 3 seconds, that is true 3 seconds from the time you press power on button to see Windows 8 screen.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Touch typist misery", "Author": "Donald Walker", "ReviewID": "R2VOU2EBYJY9N5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There is much to like about this laptop. Here's why I want to throw it out the window every time I use it. I am a touch typist. The touchcpad on this laptop is too big. The heels of my thumbs touch it while I type, so my computer is always doing surprising things as I type, like moving the cursor around, deleting sentences and paragraphs, and other aggravating things. I go from 80 words / minute to about 10 after having to constantly fix what I've already typed. I hate my laptop. Also, my laptop is terrible with holding onto an Internet connection. I spend lots of time now working in the lunch room because I can maintain an Internet connection there. My office is now just a place to hang my coat. (My netbook, old laptop, and iPad have none of the connection issues this laptop has -- in the office, at home, in hotels, in coffee shops.) BTW, I have a Dell 15\" XPS laptop. What exactly other identification numbers to with it, I have no idea. In regard to the problem noted above, I have had to fix this review four times while typing. I think I will put duct tape over the touchpad to see if that fixes the problem. I'm serious.", "Date": "December 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Long story short: I returned it", "Author": "ian", "ReviewID": "R2D7ZM2MOG4G7V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First impressions of the computer were great. It was nice, it was fast, and the screen was outright beautiful and vibrant. However, there were many technical issues. For example, the screen brightness would not change, even with the function keys or through the operating system -- even though it showed the brightness was going up and down, it never did. This was due to a faulty driver I had to uninstall (an Intel driver). I also had major Wi-Fi connectivity issues. I would have four bars on the Wi-Fi strength, take two steps into another room (no joke, it was two steps) and no connection could be found. Even when I managed to connect, it was very slow.Additionally, even though its not as big of a deal as the other two issues... The trackpad was bad. Its made out of some sort of glass and it isn't very smooth or slick, so it is hard to move my fingers around and navigate.I would not recommend this product, it looks nice, but its junk. I mean, did Dell not test these things (especially a faulty driver)?", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009FX7CZO"}}
