{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's the right laptop for what I wanted 4.5*", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R34G4W3XZYZY4T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wanted a 13.3\" laptop, something smaller than my 17.3\" Toshiba and larger than my Acer Netbook.  The 17.3 is too big for travel and netbook has several limitations and requires external drives.  Started looking for a reasonable 13.3\" but found this HP dv5-2135 DX midsize unit is slightly larger (.5\" wider) than a 13.3\" and had everything I was looking for, so I ordered it.When it arrived my first impression was it was physically larger than I thought and I too at first had a hard time with the sensative touchpad.  But was soon relieved when I compared it side by side with the 13.3\" and I have aclimated to using the touchpad, yes it is different from those used in the past.  Learned to use only one finger as the buttons are part of the pad.  The screen is very bright which is good for persons of a certain age, ha ha.  Contrary to some others comments, I really like the keyboard it has good key spacing for my large fingers, is positive to the touch and I very seldom missed keystrokes compared to the high dollar Toshiba!  The wiFi has been flawless so I can't understand why someone complained unless they had a lemon.Now, was this the perfect laptop?  Has anyone ever found the perfect laptop? In my application it's as perfect as it get's and I would highly reccomend it.If I didn't have the learning curve with the touchpad I'd give it five stars, I gave it four, as there is no way to give it 4.5 which is where I think it belongs.JerryB", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Why all the negatives.", "Author": "Eddrington Allen", "ReviewID": "R99RW1A2V9AO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "omg. this is a great computer. the screen is bright. the speed is fantastic. the wifi is good. check your own router. all i can say is that it is a very good laptop. there are some things u need to know about this laptop. the battery lasts about 2 hours. the mouse is sensitive but thats good as u do not need to press hard to operate it. the sound is a little soft hence a reason for headphones jack. the keyboard is fine. it's called an island style keyboard.so to sum it up very good laptop. have it about a 10 months. got it for university. works great for all my projects and etc. the entertainment aspect is great also.games can work.", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice but a couple glitches", "Author": "SteveE", "ReviewID": "R1NFFMKE7P9ZEJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Nice screen, keys are well spaced so if you have larger hands this is just the ticket.

It makes too much noise and heats up very fast.2.

My largest complaint is that the wireless connection device in it is horrible and cannot establish a decent connection for more than 10 minutes; you have to stop whatever you are doing to fix it every time it is disabled. This is not a router problem. All the other wireless devices in my home connect just fine. Another problem is that the keyboard is horrible. I am a fast typist (around 90+wpm) and I have had to stop to correct the letters that were not registered at least 15 times thus far in this paragraph. I am an English student, so I have to type a lot of notes and papers for classes.  I got this laptop on sale at Best Buy for around $550, but this is something I would have payed about $200 for. DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP; IT ISN'T WORTH IT.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "It is just ok.", "Author": "CSE", "ReviewID": "R1MNYT43U7SWQK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have owned this PC for 3 months. It is not the worse laptop, but it is not very useful for work. The keyboard is horrible. Typing requires you to type very slowly and with great force. If you try to type by touch at a decent rate (30+ words a minute), you will find that many of the letters that you typed are not registered. Additionally, for a entertainment laptop, it is difficult to open the cd/dvd door. The Sound is not that great for even a laptop.
