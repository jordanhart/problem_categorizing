Took it back and the store gave me a different one since it was within 24 hours and it seemed to work good, then started having little glitches and I got the 'blue screen' in less than 5 months the hard drive died... Dell sent a new one to Geek Squad and ever since it has been ok... Kaspersky was a huge mistake to put on here as an anti-virus, so I would avoid that program at all costs. I love how big the computer is but I'm now in school and I'm afraid to take it because it could get stolen, get knocked off the desk (because it is so huge), so I think this will be a stay at home computer and I'll look into a mini.... I'd rather break something thats $200 than $800! The computer seems pretty quick with its processes thanks to the i5 core processor. Great graphics on the screen which is very crisp and bright, and has a decent battery life. I can work on homework online for about 4 hours before I need to try to get plugged in. The key board takes some getting used to because it is very wide, but once you have the hang of it, you could almost never go back... I love the size on the computer for watching TV shows or movies off Hulu or Netflix. I would recommend this computer.. I'm just a little gun shy though since the hard drive died on me in less than 6 months of owning it!", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it, and Windows 7", "Author": "Brett A.

I haven't had one single issue, I use some pretty powerful applications like Visual Studio 2010 Professional, and SQL Server 2008, and have never had any of the issues that they have. Every manufacturer has DOA units and ones that have hadware issues due to mishandling by shipping companies dropping boxes, ect. It's a great HD laptop for the money with a huge screen!

So I had to install all of them right out of the box.  When the headphone or speaker cable is plugged in the laptop, sound still came from the speaker on occasion.  So it required some immediate driver updates.  The speaker sound is horrible compared to other laptops (non-Dell), so you better always use speakers or headphones.  I'm not going write any comments about the OS because that's not what the review refers to.More audio problems:  screencasting does not allow recording from the speakers, only from the microphone, but I need both, because I make many tutorials, how-to videos, and presentations for work.  After reading about many other people having the same problem as me, I discovered it is because of the Dell hardware and drivers.  It turns out all Dell computers have this problem, except the Studio line of computers.  This is not a Windows 7 problem at all, the OS works just the way it's supposed to.  If I knew this very powerful laptop can't do something as simple as screencasting, I would have never purchased this laptop.  So I'm currently using an external USB sound card and it works just fine with Windows 7.  I can't blame Microsoft for the design of the OS, I can only blame Dell for using shoddy hardware when building the computer.  This was my first and last personal computer by Dell.  I have always used HP before this computer for home use.New Updated Review Made On October 2012: (now two stars)After first purchasing the laptop, nothing was functioning right as well as lots of junk software pre-installed, so I had to re-install Windows 7 (which I always do on new computers) on the brand new computer; this was two years ago. I recently re-installed Windows 7, three months ago, and re-partitioned the hard drive over the summer and after getting everything set up the way I want, it seems to be working optimally. It was a pain to get the sound drivers to work right again (sound drivers seem to always be a problem on Dell computers), especially the ability to record from the wave-out function while screencasting, so you have to be willing to fiddle around with different software for it to work right. For some reason, after using a second sound card software and hardware, that fixed the problem with the original soundcard, so be prepared to get upset with this \"scumbag\" computer, but it should work eventually after tinkering with it. After two years of using it, the battery only holds a one hour charge and I have always allowed the battery to charge and discharge on it's own daily and nightly. Other than that, the computer runs just fine.  The speakers in the computer have always been lousy, so always use headphones or a real speaker system. After reinstalling the OS, video games seem to be running great on this computer as well.  Dual operating systems running via VirtualBox seem to keep up with the amount of memory and cpu power without slowing down.  Since this is a two year old computer, I would suggest to find a more powerful computer for this same cost or less cost, which is completely possible as of now.\"It is not so much using a Dell, as it is tricking it or fooling it into doing what it is you really want it to do.\" --Hunter Cressall.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Never buy anything from Dell", "Author": "moe", "ReviewID": "RFGSP57024UCV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought an inspiron 1764 from dell.  When the microwave gets turned on my internet is lost.  Never happened with my Toshiba!!  First off, I will say that Dell customer service is the worst!!!  Never have I seen such bad service.  I complained to the BBB and they sent out a technician with a new wireless card but we spent 2 hours trying to download the driver.  Then the technician came out again and they sent the same damn wireless card and we had the same damn problem!!!  They wanted to leave that card in my laptop and then have me call their software division to get it working...Since I knew how incompetent dell was I said no!!  When I tried to call them back they said the person I was speaking to would call them back and I never heard from him!!!  If you want to risk buying a laptop from dell with very bad customer service, then I wish you the best.  My Toshiba was a great laptop and have heard people praise Toshiba and people say the same about dell as I have!!!", "Date": "November 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dude! I got a Dell!!", "Author": "Moo", "ReviewID": "R1CQVHQVP3TQ9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been working with computers for over 18 years. I have to say Dell puts out some amazing machines and some poor ones too. With the mass production they have to maintain, I expect a few bad ones or at least hear about them. I am a former Geek Squad employee and I have seen my fair share of Dell systems. Sometimes its software and sometimes its hardware that goes wrong, but the laptop I have received from the seller on amazon is just amazing! This is my first 17 inch screen laptop and I must say it is performing just great! I know some things can go wrong over time, but I have yet to see anything since I got the laptop about a month ago. I am still trying to benchmark this laptop and I was hoping to find one with a dedicated video card, but apparently there have been some issues with them and dell opted for a shared memory video card in these laptops. Now with that said, I ordered the max amount of memory, which is 8GB, and installed it the same day I received the laptop. I have no issues with video or speed of the laptop, since I do not plan of using it for gaming, this is just going to be used for internet and college! I also suggest installing a security suite software before trying to surf the internet with any computer you own or buy. The only thing I see wrong with this machine is that it did not have an express card slot, but that is my fault for not paying attention and it was not a necessity anyway. I really enjoy this laptop since I was looking for one that can act like a desktop but be mobile. So if you plan on getting a Dell, always get an extended warranty, because as with all machines they are bound to malfunction at some point. Also, don't forget to register your Dell on their website so that when you call for support, it will be easier for them to help you.
