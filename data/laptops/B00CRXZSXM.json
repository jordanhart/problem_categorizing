{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ignore the bad review! Great budget laptop! *STUDENT REVIEW*", "Author": "Andres", "ReviewID": "R1JUCLTJOTPL3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop with college in mind, after using it a few days I can say its a great budget laptop, feels snappy and starts in no time(just needed to uninstall some bloat that came from factory)Pros:-The touchscreen is really sensitive and works great, it makes getting used to windows 8 a lot easier!-Battery file is acceptable(around 7 hours using word processing and making slideshows)-Function keys are reversed(meaning you hit the function key to use F1,F2,ect, instead of the functions)-The screen is great for looking at pictures and 1080p videos with no lag.-The speakers are actually good for music and movies(placed below the laptop)-Windows boots in around 7 seconds, even after installing a lot of programs.-Full keyboard layout! you have a full numerical pad.Cons:-While its no big deal for most, it doesnt comes with an optical drive.-Depending on your way of typing angle you might have issues the keyboard.-My biggest issue would be with the space bar, as you need to hit it firmly if you press it on its side instead of the center of the key-you might touch accidentally the touchpad depending on how you place your hand in the laptop when you write( the touchpad is slightly to the left instead of at the center, probably because of the full keyboard layout)The relation price-specs is great, and while it can be considered a budget, it will be fast for normal use, web browsing and working, you can easily use it a full day of college if you use the sleep mode and the balanced performance, the build quality is surprisingly good, while its plastic, it feels sturdy and resilient. and while at first you might encounter some issues with the keyboard, after a few hours you get used to it and wont hinder your typing speed.So dont let a bad review scare you! Its a great laptop that will suffice the needs for any student :)!P.S. I typed this from the Laptop. No problems handling my typing speed at all. And ask questions if you need them answered.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT listen to the 1 star....Great computer", "Author": "Lucas Vance", "ReviewID": "R215QZS35FYGXE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Due to the fact that the person who was the only one to have written a review i feel the need to write a truthful and understanding review from someone who actually knows more about computers than they have buttons...so i bought this on the black friday sale and i could not have less regretted my purchase...overall a great computer, the keys on the keyboard are very smooth and the touchscreen is flawless...even when typing....is very quick in comparison from my older laptop(dual core AMD 4GB RAM Acer) i love the intel i3 so smooth...yes it doesnt come with a DVD/CD drive but that is expected with the newer lighter computers...this computer is not heavy at all...the screen is crisp and bright...windows 8 takes a lil bit to get use to but so far i love it...its also really good with touchscreen they're definitely made to go together...hope this helps people make a great choice...once again i do not regret this buy at all", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice!", "Author": "susie", "ReviewID": "R2IE2311P5GB2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very, very nice laptop, exactly what I was looking for.

Intel i3 is more than enough for daily use on surfing webs, documents, movies, ect.. Certainly not for intense 3D gaming, but touch screen feature adds extra fun experience for games on MS app stores which unable to enjoy with traditional keyboard/mouse/touchpad.touchscreen + Intel i3 cpu for less than $500 (current price as of now) at year 2013, good deal to meI was lucky enough to purchase this notebook $399 from amazon during the black friday sale.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lenovo, who?

I now own a $500 brick with a black screen that will do nothing except sit there and the start switch blinks.  Can someone explain to me why this wasn't pre-loaded with Win 8.1??  What a joke!  And Amazon won't take it back either since its been opened - so I'm really and truly screwed!!

Seems to be a little slow in loading web pages. Most frustrating is that I can not update to Windows 8.1. I tried it several tomes but when it comes to restarting the screen stays black and the PC wont restart to finish the upgrade. It seems like that this is an issue with Lenovo and they are apparently not helpful at all if someone contacts them about it. I am not a computer geek and I guess I can work with what I have but it would still be nice to get what you paid for. Looks like I will not recommend any Lenovo product in the future.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "dvd player would be nice", "Author": "marla schlesinger", "ReviewID": "R1RDMGC9IVQ4EU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was disappointed to find that the laptop did not have a built in dvd drive.
