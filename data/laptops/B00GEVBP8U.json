The fan makes high sound when running for high graphics applications and being hot rearward. I can live with that because the high combatibility is amazing. The buyer is very keen to make the customer happy. I will buy from them again.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "A remarkable machine", "Author": "BobinmidMO", "ReviewID": "R2ZDSEOGOGWXB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While the idea of spending $3,000 on a notebook sounds insane, this time IT'S WORTH IT!  Having owned mine for three months, I'm surprised daily over just how capable this machine is.  The battery life makes it a portable workhorse that will exceed nearly any computing need you have today or that you'll have for years to come.  For those with vision diminishment, the Retina display must be seen to be appreciated.  Now I can enjoy computing again:)  That's why I got this model.  Buying this maxed out flagship makes sense since it's a long term purchase.  Don't forget to add Apple Care.  Three years of insurance plus tech care over anything and everything makes is a comforting insurance after hitting the wallet this hard.  Apple really does care about us the owner after the sale.  Apple Care proves it night or day.  Believe it or not, this isn't a machine for those with egos.  It's a sound investment for those who want the best.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GEVBP8U"}}
