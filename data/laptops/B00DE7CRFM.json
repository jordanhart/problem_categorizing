But, that is because the version that I purchased had one hdmi port and no other display ports. Now, this notebook has been upgraded with an additional VGA port. Secondly, the earlier version sported an integrated dispay chip, the i7-4600. This newer version now has the newer i7-4800. For a comparison, I would copy and paste the following link into your browser: [...]For Whom: ANYONE. In my first review, I had said that it's affordable (at $1800.00) to the average consumer who needs a powerful home/business/entertainment laptop. Also, this PC bundle is exactly for users who are looking to spend their money carefully. Since that price is now above $1900.00 (but still below $2000.00) I'd consider carefully what your purposes are for buying this laptop.What I said in my earlier review was: Should You Wait For SSD Prices to Come Down?: That is certainly your option and I respect it. I asked myself the same question. My conclusion is that, for now, most manufacturers seem to be using smaller SSDs and marketing them as \"boot drives\" that direct data to an on-board, secondary drive - Yep, it's that familiar spinning disk drive,still revolving at 7200 rpm, or 5400 rpm. Marketers now call these secondary drives, \"data storage drives.\" But it seems that computer makers also want you to link SSD boot speed to the fictional idea of owning a super-computer. To be fair, your laptop may boot up faster. You may even see some improvement in the speed of programs you run. But the latter depends upon a whole lot more than booting through a small SSD. You may not see much improvement. At least I can promise this - you will notice that you are poorer. I still stand by this.In my earilier review, I'd stated: For now, the price point ($1800.00) for this particular HP Envy computer bundle is where buyers like me want it to be. For this relatively low and competitive price, this powerful HP Envy should yield several good years of use, not to mention the fun of a Windows 8 touchscreen environment, while delivering much needed computer speed. And did I forget to mention that the form factor of the HP Envy is sleek and well designed? You'll even feel that quality in its body. Even the HP Envy keyboard is well engineered to provide a noticeably more natural and comfortable place to rest your fingers. Now, I leave it to you to decide. The upgrades to this new configuration are absolutely fair. The laptop won't get cheaper when you increase its power and longevity. Sadly, it isn't within my comfortable price range anymore, given what I require it for, but if you purchase this, I will certainly be jealous. (I'll still be glad for you; this laptop is still so fairly priced, it is still the least expensive and well-built laptop on the market.That's about it.P.S. Again, keep in mind that the earlier version laptop that I purchased had only one hdmi port and no other display ports. Now, this notebook has been upgraded with an additional VGA port.
