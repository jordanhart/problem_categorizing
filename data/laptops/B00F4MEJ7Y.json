{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great, portable bang for your buck, with a touchscreen to boot.", "Author": "Drew Williams", "ReviewID": "R1A8J222QSQT94", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently picked up a slightly higher performance version of the 14r-5437 (i5/8G/1TB) and had to find a place to write a review about it. I must say that I'm very impressed by the performance of this thing. Quick to boot/wake from sleep, runs just about anything I need it for, and has absolutely *astounding* battery life.The battery is by far the part I'm most impressed with. I've had it about a week, and I've literally plugged it in twice the entire time. Factor in how much I'm using it (because it's new - setup, configuration, tinkering, toying around, etc.) and you'll get an idea of what I'm talking about.I take all of Windows' battery life estimates with a grain of salt, but at 100% charge it actually estimated over 16 hours of charge remaining. From an i5? Are you kidding me? This is my first experience with the 4th gen ULV Intel i-series processors and I must say I'm thoroughly impressed. I'm coming from a dual-core 2nd generation (35w) i7 Ultrabook and the difference is unbelievable. Very similar performance and (at least) double the battery life.The only gripe I have about it is Dells choice of a 5400 RPM HDD (though I can't complain about the amount of storage). Resuming from hibernation is a little sluggish with the amount of memory my model has (might not be as much of an issue on the 4GB models). If it were offered with a SATA-3 SSD, it would be the perfect portable powerhouse, *and* would have even better battery life. I'll soon be completely decommissioning my old Ultrabook and swapping out the SSD in it for the mechanical HDD in this one. I know I won't be disappointed since this thing supports the full 6Gbps transfer rate of SATA-3.Overall, very impressed.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F4MEJ7Y"}}
