{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Switched from Windows: More good than bad.  Great hardware", "Author": "Jeffrey Stanley", "ReviewID": "R1DA3BK8I1XXDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Mac computer.  My first four computers ran Win 3.1, Windows 95, XP, and Vista (from about 1995-present).  I have quite a lot of time spent on each of them.  Switching from Windows to Mac is not difficult, but it can be a bit frustrating for a week or so.  There are Windows features that you will miss, but they are mostly overcome by overall advantages in my opinion.I've spent two weeks with this machine now.  If I had written this review after one day, I would have probably stated that I regretted the switch to Mac.  After getting more proficient with the machine and realizing how well it works, I would definitely recommend it to a friend.This review is going to be a mix of my impressions of both the hardware and the Mac operating system from a new Mac user perspective.The only difference between my machine and the one on this product page is that I ordered directly from Apple and upgraded the hard drive to 250GB (from the 160GB base option).  I am using 2gb of ram and the lower-end processor.My Mac OS impressions:The biggest thing I missed from Windows at first was the task bar.  Mac uses the \"dock\" to replace the task bar.  The dock is kind of like the quick launch toolbar in Windows spread out across the entire bar, with large icons.  Having used windows with a task bar for the past 13 years, I missed the ability to see all open programs and switch between them with the task bar.  The dock has a tiny dot below the icon on running-programs, but nothing else to separate it from other program and folder icons.  The dock is not nearly as useful for multitasking as the task bar.The saving grace that rescues the Mac from awkward app-switching while multitasking is called expose.  Expose is activated by either pressing a key or using a multitouch gesture (four-finger swipe).  Expose uses the entire screen to display all open windows and allow you to switch between them.  It's like alt+tab on steroids.  Having used the machine for a couple weeks, I miss using expose when I use my Windows machine.  As much as I hated the dock at first, I have to give the advantage to the Mac for managing multiple windows while multitasking.The controls for open-windows are quite different than in MS-Windows.  In Mac, there is a resize, hide, and minimize button instead of maximize, minimize, restore, and close.  To close an app on the mac you need to use a menu command or keyboard shortcut.  The Mac resize button kind of works like restore/maximize, only it's a bit more awkward.  A commenter here pointed out that it resizes the window for ideal viewing without using the entire screen.  I find myself resizing windows by dragging corners more than I ever did on a Windows machine.  I really miss the ability to maximize, if for no other reason but to avoid distractions.  The green resize button may be better on an enormous monitor, but not on a 13\" notebook.  When you minimize or hide an app on the Mac, it is only available from the dock and is hidden from expose.  I'll give the window size-management advantage to Windows in this contest.  The windows system is just easier and more logical in my opinion.  It isn't a deal-breaker, but I do miss the Windows \"window controls.\"  If you are a frequent user of the F11 key while web browsing in Windows you'll have to kiss that feature goodbye.  Neither Firefox nor Safari will go full-screen.Windows Explorer is \"replaced\" with an app called Finder.  Finder is kind of like the start menu and an explorer window all rolled up into one.  Compared with older versions of Windows, finder is adequate but Vista's explorer is quite a bit easier and more logical to use.  I prefer Vista's preview pane to Mac's coverflow.  I miss the \"up folder\" button.  I have found myself mostly using the view that puts files, folders and apps into a column view for easiest computer browsing, and it just isn't as elegant as Windows Vista.  The lack of a maximize button has caused frustration especially in the finder, because the finder likes to stay in a very small window unless you drag the corners.The Safari web browser is nice and quick and has a decent security reputation.  I have been switching back and forth between Safari and Firefox.  Firefox has crashed a couple of times and I really like being able to use multitouch gestures with Safari, so I'm leaning toward making Safari my main web tool.  Reading RSS feeds, and the bookmark toolbar are really well done in Safari.  Browsers are so personal that it's difficult to recommend one over the other, but as a Firefox user in Windows I think I have high standard and Safari has met or exceeded them.I absolutely hate the iPhoto app.  Iphoto does not allow you to organize and browse your photos in folders.  It imports your pictures and sorts them itself based on time/date stamps on the photos.  This works fine for personal vacation snapshots but it completely mixed up the rest of my images.  Folders that were neatly organized for work projects, and fun web clippings, and adult stuff were all shuffled into one big mess after I imported my image collection.  I ended up just deleting all of them and not using iphoto at all.  Right now I'm just using Finder to browse my photos and the preview app to view them.  Light editing work isn't possible in the preview app and I still haven't decided what to use for a basic photo editor yet.  Vista's photo app is junk but it's still superior to iPhoto if you like to keep your photos organized using your own folder system.  I know people who love iphoto.  It comes down to whether you want the ability to organize your collection yourself.  If you have a big mess of photos, you'll love iphoto's ability to organize them via event and face recognition.Edited to add: you can organize your photos into \"albums\" after you import them into iPhoto, but be prepared to spend a lot of time reorganizing everything.  Even after you organize into albums, the main library screen gives you views of your entire collection (perhaps things you don't want everyone to see).I have not used Garage Band or iMovie yet.  I'll update later when I get a chance.Edited to add: I played with garage band a bit and it's pretty powerful.  It allows you to import and export AAC and MP3 tracks and record sound in multiple tracks.  Very easy to use.  The only other audio app i've ever used is audacity and I much prefer Garage Band.  I haven't used any of the music lessons it offers yet but plan to soon.I played with iMovie for a few minutes and it seems pretty nice and very intuitive.  I actually don't mind Windows Movie Maker, which is included with Vista.  I would not consider it a big step up from Win Movie Maker, but it's a nice app.The mail, calendar, and address book apps are basic but work very very well.  The address app will import common file types easily.  It will sync with yahoo out of the box.  Address book will only sync with Google contacts if you own an iPhone or iPod Touch.Everyone has an opinion about iTunes.  I'm a big fan of it.  It's exactly like the windows version only it runs a bit faster without the bugs. If you have an iPhone or iPod touch, the Windows-iTunes bug with time/date being wrong after the computer sleeps is not an issue on the Mac.Time machine is the Mac's backup app.  It is amazing and very simple.  I'm using an external drive plugged into my Apple Airport wireless router, as a backup disk.  My wireless disk showed up on my desktop instantly once I plugged it into the router.  Time machine noticed the external drive right away and went to work backing up my files (after asking permission of course).  Now my machine automatically backs up any changes every hour as long as I'm in range of my wireless access point.  Time machine is a big load off my mind.  If I ever have a drive failure or my computer is destroyed I have an exact backup of everything without remembering to backup my files.  Vista will backup according to a set schedule, but it lacks the ability to easily look through backups for specific files.  Time machine is wonderful and make wireless backup effortless.The Mac disk utility is almost as good as the one in Vista and it's easier to use.  It's far superior to the one in XP.  I used it to format my external wireless drive because the Mac router couldn't read NTFS formating (although the computer can read NTFS drives via USB for some reason).The graphics control software is a joy to use.  When I plug in my external monitor it immediately extends my desktop to the new monitor.  Adjusting everything from resolution to rotation couldn't be any easier.Boot camp is a utility that allows you to create a partition and install Windows as a secondary boot system (you need to own or buy a legal single-disk 32bit copy of either Windows XP or Windows Vista).  When you start up the boot camp utility, it gives you a choice between using either 5 or 32 GB of space for the Windows partition.  I learned the hard way that Windows XP SP3 won't fit into 5GB.  You need to give it at least the 32 GB (which left me with almost exactly 200GB on my \"250\" GB drive).  Installing Windows using the Boot Camp utility is very very easy.  Once you get Windows loaded, your OSX install disk makes quick work of installing drivers for all of your laptop's hardware.  It's too bad that Nvidia and HP aren't as good at putting together easy Windows driver packages as Apple.  In order to boot into Windows, you simply press the \"option\" key during bootup and it allows you to choose which OS to run.  Windows XP absolutely screams on this hardware.The hardware:The hardware is where this computer really shines.The biggest advantage is stability.  My last computer purchase was a vista machine.  To say that I had stability and hardware compatibility issues with my HP Vista desktop is an understatement.  The main reason I turned to mac for this purchase was the fact that the hardware, drivers, and software are made for each other.  This machine has ran flawlessly for the past two weeks.  I did have two crashes of the Firefox browser while watching Flash video, but only the browser went down rather than the entire system.I have connected an external monitor, camera, ipod, USB drive, and router to this machine.  All of the drivers were already installed and everything has \"just worked.\"  The hardware is a joy to use when it just works.  It is difficult to put into words how happy I am with the lack of effort in using this machine.The speed isn't blazing-fast but it runs very well, even with many many apps and windows running.  My Vista desktop has similar specs, but my new Mac feels slightly faster.One outstanding productivity feature of this machine is the touch pad.  I honestly prefer it to using a mouse for office and browsing tasks.  I can't say enough good things about the multitouch gestures.  Two finger scrolling, two finger right-click, three finger forward and back in Safari, and four finger expose make this machine feel like like it is part of you.  Having the entire surface of the touchpad as the button is brilliant, especially for drag and drop operations.  The large size of the touchpad makes it very precise.The keyboard is really nice.  At first I thought the keys were a bit soft and the travel was too shallow, but I quickly got used to it and now prefer it to my more \"clicky\" desktop keyboard.  I don't know how I lived this long without a backlit keyboard.  The backlight is more useful than I thought it would be.The display is beautiful.  It has good color, a wide viewing angle, and is plenty bright for indoor environments.  I would prefer that the screen wasn't glass, but the reflections aren't as bad as I feared.  If there is a bright light source behind you, you'll need to angle the screen to reduce the glare but it's workable.The DVD drive is a DVD drive.  It feels slow and makes a lot of noise.  I've never owned an optical drive that I considered fast and quiet, and this one isn't any exception.  It works well, but isn't anything special.The battery life is incredible.  The seven hour battery life is not an exaggeration if you are using the computer for light browsing and office apps.  Expect about 4-5 hours if you're using it for heavy web browsing and a bit of media.  Listening to music with the display off would easily last over the advertised 7 hours.  Streaming high definition video on netflix using wireless will knock it down to at or below three hours.  I haven't watched DVD movies on battery power but I expect it to barely get you through a single two hour film with a bit left over.The size and weight are ideal for portability.  4.5lbs doesn't exactly feel light until you compare it to similarly spec'd machines that weigh a full pound (20%) more.  I wouldn't want a larger machine if I had to lug it around much.The speakers are quite good for a small light machine.  Don't expect much bass, but the sound is very clear with good mids and highs.  The speakers are plenty loud for listening to podcasts or music in a semi-quiet medium sized room or office.  I won't need to pack external speakers for use in my hotel room when I travel, like my last laptop.The \"magsafe\" power adapter is more than just a gimmick, and more than just a way to avoid tripping and breaking your machine.  The \"power brick\" itself is a lot smaller than my last dell laptop.  It's exactly the same size as the USB wall adapters that used to be included with ipods.  The cord is 6ft long and the brick includes fold-out wings to wrap the cord around.  It is very well thought-out for travel.  With the cord wrapped up and the plug folded into the body, the power brick only takes up about 2.5\" x 3\" x 1\" in your bag.  When you are using it at home or at the office there is an included 6ft extension cord for the power brick so you aren't as tethered to your desk.The computer runs very cool compared to most laptops.  Also, there are no vents where super-heated air blows out.  While I'm sure it uses a fan, I've never audibly actually heard it run or felt a stream of warm air from it.  I think it may vent through ports and the keyboard but it runs cool enough that you don't notice it.  Edited to add: it does get rather warm when watching high resolution video, but stays quite cool when web browsing or using normal office apps.  Even when very warm, the fan is still quiet (the only way to actually hear the fan is to hold it near your ear).The only drawback to the hardware compared to Windows machines is the fact that there is no option to hibernate when closing the lid.  It sleeps when you close the lid but it still is using a small amount of power.  If you're only going to be away for a couple hours this isn't an issue, but you must completely shut down when on battery power if you're going to be away much longer.This machine is a lot more expensive than similarly spec'd Windows machines but I feel that it's worth the money.  I'm a very satisfied Mac switcher.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Macbook graduates to PRO status!", "Author": "Nate \"bigetan\"", "ReviewID": "R3IO3TVYYXPJVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well I must say I am very happy i did not buy apple's first iteration of the 13\" aluminum macbook last year b/c they really got it right the second time around upgrading it to a macbook pro!  Its nice to have that \"pro\" stamp on a 13\" now!  Apple has listened to their customers adding almost everything we have asked for and more, and managed to reduce the price!  Thanks Apple!CHANGES FROM LAST YEAR- $100 less- 13\" aluminum macbooks became macbook pros- 2.53Ghz up from 2.4GHz dual core- 4GB RAM up from 2GB- led display has 60% greater color gamut than previous model- new advanced built-in battery that lasts up to 7 hours vs 4hrs- FireWire is back (after all the complaints of first model)- SD card slot (replaces express card slot)- new models now come with iLife '09- separate digital audio input is gone- new model uses the same integrated mic and headphone port as the iPhonePROS-  finally a price cut with a performance upgrade!  i knew apple could do it.  i was tired of paying for aesthetics and not performance.-  new Snow Leopard Operating System comes pre-installed! Same great ease of use with much faster performance!-  much better lcd screen! inline with the pro models...still glossy and still some glare but much nicer!-  backlight keyboard on all 13\" models now! ( i really enjoy this as it can be controlled from low to high)-  battery life is significantly better than last year.( i get about 6 hours w/ regular use not the 7hrs that is reported)-  the computer is designed beautifully truly a head turner.-  iLife 09 suite is superb for pictures, movies, and music.  Good software really does sell hardware.-  SD card slot accepts SDHC, which goes up to 32GB and works like a charm.  (can boot from SD card as well)CONS- aluminum outer casing does dent easily if dropped. (buy a soft case for it!)- power cord is short and does not reach as many places as I would like...must sit very close to power outlet.- battery can't be removed easily- SD card sticks about half way out of slot. eye sore.- blu-ray option would have been nice but understandable given licensing fees. (many blurays are offering digital copies which help)Taking into consideration all the great improvements over last year with a nice price cut I can now truly recommend this near perfect Macbook Pro!", "Date": "June 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not sure why all of the haters keep griping about Compact Flash...", "Author": "DR", "ReviewID": "R29AN2GC4M6VZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my brand new 13.3\" Macbook Pro in the mail. I customized mine with 4GB of RAM and a 250 GB hard drive, but with the entry-level 2.26 GHz Intel processor. I unboxed it in front of my mother and sister, and they were both oohing and aahing about how beautiful and thin it was. They also loved the magnetic connector on the end of the power adapter that snaps the power cord into the computer nearly by itself. I powered the computer up, went through the Leopard setup screens, and within minutes was logged in. While starting up, the light sensor powered on, the screen dimmed, and the keyboard lit-up automatically. Everything about this computer suggests ingenious design and engineering, with great attention to every detail. It is very light, and since I am using this for school, I am very happy with the size and form factor, particularly the charger. Switching from a large Dell that sported a charger that could be used to bludgeon somebody to death, the small white charger that is about the size of a wallet is a breath of fresh air. This laptop will be a pleasure to travel with.Are there things this computer lacks? Yes, there is no Blu-Ray player, which would have been nice, but for me was not a deal-breaker. I suspect that the next-gen MBP's will phase out the rotary hard drives and switch to solid state as the standard, and will all have Blu-Ray players. Until that time, this little laptop is more than sufficient.If I had to come up with a gripe about this computer, there is really only one- and this is true for most of Apple's products- the iPod, iPhone, and MBP's- I wish that they would not coat portable products with textures that are so easy to scratch. It is apparent that after a few months of toting this to class, it is going to have some scuffs on it. It seems like a bit of a paradox that a company that puts so much value on aesthetics seems only to care about how the product looks when it is taken out of the original packaging. That said, this laptop feels extremely sturdy, and apart from normal wear and tear marks, I am not fearful that it will fall apart, which is a whole lot more than I can say for my previous piece of crap plastic Dell.In reading other reviews, people seem to be unable to understand that this qualifies as an ultra-portable laptop. It is simply not going to have a peripheral hookup for every type of flash card and five USB hookups. Are people serious with lambasting Apple for merging the audio jack in/out ports into one single port? Really, who gives a rat's a$$? This is a PORTABLE computer, not a media center. If you are a user who favors those things, then you are free to go out and purchase the necessary adapters, but I would rather have a lightweight computer that I can easily tote around. If you want a laptop that is prepared for any occasion, go buy an 8 lb. Dell desktop replacement, and have fun. I for one think people just want a reason to moan or find something to complain about. The fact is that for the money, you are not going to find a better laptop than this one. It costs a bit more than competing PC products, but I have owned Dell's and HP's, and I can tell you, you get what you pay for. If you use your laptop for at least a couple of hours a day, I think it is worth a couple hundred extra to get a really high quality product that makes you happy, and that is why I upgraded to the MBP.", "Date": "June 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Apple's lightest full-featured notebook", "Author": "Cuyler", "ReviewID": "R3NW0EN92LKU0J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There are lots of positives.  First, the aluminum unibody design is both gorgeous and practical.  The precision construction gives the whole unit a solid feel.  Aluminum and glass won't wear out like the plastic on many other laptops.  The silver matte finish with black keys looks classy as well.Fingers glide easily over the large, glass trackpad.  The trackpad also operates as a mouse button -- it takes a small amount of pressure to click it.  Other trackpads I've used often register a click just putting my fingers down -- the MacBook Pro's trackpad gives physical feedback which reduces those mis-clicks.Multiple-finger gestures make it a snap to navigate through documents and websites. Pressing with two fingers instead of one performs the equivalent of a right click.  Swiping with 2 fingers scrolls the current window.  Spreading fingers apart zooms in; pinching zooms out (similar to the iPhone).  Swiping 4 fingers exposes the desktop or switches between applications.  These gestures are intuitive and it is hard going back to the Windows laptop after getting used to their convenience (I am really hooked on the 2-finger scrolling).The keyboard automatically lights up as the room light dims.  This isn't an essential feature (especially for touch typists), but is helpful for picking out the correct function keys after dark.  It's little touches like this that make the MacBook Pro a pleasure to use.Apple put a lot of thought into the design of their power supply.  It has a special connector that attaches magnetically to main body -- so it connects easily and won't cause your laptop to crash to the floor if you trip over it.  The connector even has a light that shows it's connected and charging (turning green when the battery reaches 100%). A little plastic clip on the cord helps manage its length.  When traveling, the extension cord can be replaced with a retractable plug that goes directly into an outlet, so there's even less to carry.  The U.S. plug is included with the MacBook Pro, but you can order plugs for other countries.The solid body, backlit keyboard and MagSafe power supply are nice design flourishes, but the important feature is the long battery life.The built-in battery can last up to 7 hours between charges so you can get almost a full day of work out of it.  The downside is that the battery cannot simply be swapped out when it gets low or reaches its end-of-life.  Apple says their smart charging method allows up to 1000 recharges and batteries should last for up to 5 years.  The inability to swap in a fresh battery could be an issue for people that take long intercontinental plane trips, although a HyperMac external battery can keep a 13\" MacBook Pro running up to 33 hours.The MacBook Pro's LED backlit display provides a wide color gamut (Apple says it is a 60% improvement over the MacBook). This is major plus for art and photography applications.  A lot of people complain the glossy display is hard to use outdoors -- I like its sharpness and mostly work under indoor lighting.  However, I can see how this might annoy some users.Apple has added a FireWire 800 port and support for up to 8GB of RAM.  Currently, the cost of a full 8GB of memory is prohibitively expensive, but 4GB is quite reasonable.  Eventually memory prices should drop and the MacBook Pro can be inexpensively upgraded to its full potential.  The support for more RAM is a welcome feature as we enter the age of 64-bit operating systems.  If you are using Photoshop, editing video or running Windows in the background, you might consider extra memory (the manual describes how to upgrade the memory yourself).The MacBook Pro is a reasonable value for the money, but cheaper laptops are certainly available.  I'll leave it to others to argue the merits of one operating system over the other.  Because the Macs are Intel-based, they can still be used to run Windows applications, either through Apple's Boot Camp or virtual machine software such as Parallels or Fusion (or Sun's free VirtualBox).  The Mac operating system, OS X, is easy to use, so Windows users needn't worry about switching.The new Macs now ship with Snow Leopard, the latest version of the Mac OS X operating system. If the 13\" MacBook Pro you bought came with Leopard, you can upgrade to Snow Leopard for $9.95 via Apple's up-to-date program (be sure to sign up within 90 days of purchase).  Google \"snow leopard up to date\" for details.What's not to like?  This MacBook Pro does not have an ExpressCard slot which limits its expandability.  Apple is probably right that most users will be satisfied with the SD slot, but pro photographers might prefer to insert their compact flash card.  3D graphic designers might want to consider one of the higher end MacBook Pros that offer a separate graphics processor. Hard core gamers should probably invest in a PC. And it's no deal-breaker, but a writable Blu-ray drive is still on my wish list.  There are rumors that the MacBook Pros will be upgraded with faster processors in January 2010.The aluminum body is durable -- I have had mine for months now and it still look great.  Naturally, nothing is totally scratch-proof and scratches on the anodized aluminum case cannot be simply buffed out.  Scuff marks happen -- true road warriors must learn to accept this as a fact of life.  However if it's a big concern, a Speck See Thru Case or InvisibleShield might offer some piece of mind.  Personally, I prefer to just be careful and carry my MacBook Pro in a Tom Bihn Ristretto messenger bag (the STM Small Alley Messenger Bag looks like good alternative).The 13\" model is perfect for someone wanting a full-featured laptop that's easy to carry around.  The MacBook Air is even more portable, but has less battery life and is not as expandable (plus the Pro's built-in DVD is convenient). To work on a larger screen, plugging into a standalone display turns the laptop into a desktop machine.  I can tell you, I would have loved to have a MacBook Pro when I had to march 20 minutes to campus for computer classes.", "Date": "June 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "A True Pro Laptop", "Author": "A. Chan", "ReviewID": "R16ZRDX88506KF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Unibody MacBook in October, and I sold it just to get the new MacBook Pro. I have to agree that the new 13\" MacBook Pro deserves the name \"Pro\" in it now. It has much better features, and this should have been the computer that the Unibody MacBook was back in October. Ever since Apple introduced the Unibody MacBook, many people complained about the loss of FireWire and the terrible screen quality. Fortunately, Apple responded to those complaints with the new 13\" MacBook Pro. The return of FireWire has made a lot of people happy, and the surprising addition of the SD Card slot made it even better. The quality of the screen is also a lot better. The screen displays much better colors, and it still carries the revolutionary LED backlit.The pricing of the MacBook Pro line has also dropped significantly. The original 15\" Pro was starting at the price of $1999, but they dropped it by $300 making it $1699. The Unibody MacBook was asking for $1299, but they are now asking for $1199 with the addition of the new features. I am very pleased that they dropped the price, as it is very rare to hear Apple drop their prices. The new features make it much more affordable. The computer still looks identical to the previous October notebook revision. It still carries the sexy Unibody design, and the backlit keyboard is now standard on all models. I actually find the backlit keyboard very useful, even as a touch typist. The gorgeous glass multi-touch trackpad still pleases me with the features and the size.After the rebranding of the Unibody MacBook, and the addition of the new features. Apple has really stepped up to the plate. They successfully tightened up the competition, as the new MacBook Pro line is now much more affordable and is priced very well. The new 13\" MacBook Pro does feel like a \"Pro\" computer, where the performance is hard to feel unsatisfied. The graphics are incredible. Even if you feel that the MacBook Pro line is still too much, Apple is also offering the classic MacBook line for a low price of $999. If you purchase this laptop now, you'll be able to upgrade to Snow Leopard for only $10. With the gorgeous Unibody design, LED backlit display, and trackpad, $1199 is a price that cannot be beaten.

The best thing going for Mac computers is OS X.  I'll use Windows in business applications, Linux in programming applications and for personal matters I'll use what is important to me for photos & videos. That is OS X.  At first I thought of getting an inexpensive net book, but its crippled in capability and doesn't have a DVD slot drive.This 13.3\" MacBook Pro has sufficient power for photo and casual video editing.  It has a small foot print that is thin, light weight and very quiet.  True, Apple charges a premium for this laptop, but it is really no more than $200 for what you get. So there is a premium for modern industrial design.There are very few laptops like this MacBook Pro which can offer the following for this price and features, namely:1.  Good resolution 1200 x 800 13.3\" display and video card can drive a 30\" monitor 2560x1600 at full resolution.2.  LED back lighting display with a very good color gamut for 13.3\" display.3.  Long life lithium polymer battery, greater than 5 hours, and excellent heat dissipation.4.  Excellent mouse tracking feature.5.  1066 MHz front side bus.6.  High quality construction, fit & finish.Now tell me if someone can find something comparable in price with a 2.53 GHz processor, or better, and 4 GB of DDR3 RAM?  They can't.

I never laid an eye on a Mac products until last year.  I have to admit that ever since the new iMac and Macbook Pro came out, I couldn't stop thinking about it.  I had 2 Dell laptops, a 14\" and a 12\", which lasted me about 6 years total before and they were fine.  I never had a recent to purchase another laptop until last Black Friday sale from Amazon which turned out to be a great deal.  I pulled the trigger on this and I haven't had a regret since.  The design and the OS is easy to use.  The keyboard lit is a great feature at night time.  The screen on this is SUPERB and it sure beat most of the PC laptops out there.  The clarity is unbelievable.  I purchased an additional 2GB or RAm to max it out and upgraded to a 320GB 7200 RPM myself.  Both installation were easy and fast.  Instructions were available in the manual and on apple's website.  If you're still debating on getting this laptop, DON'T, JUST DO IT.  I assure you won't regret having this laptops compare to any other PC one out there.  Sure there are many that are cheaper and have more features but the quality of this is excellent and it's thin and did I mention GORGEOUS looking.", "Date": "March 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "I'm finally off the fence!", "Author": "R. Reed", "ReviewID": "R33FVS66MMYY1B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a long time PC user and had been in the market for a notebook the last few months.  I wanted something light and powerful that I could take along with my dSLR and photography gear and to do some light post processing in the field.When at home, I planned on hooking it up to an external display for more critical post processing work, so a 13-14\" notebook was perfect for my needs.I seriously looked at the Macbooks because of the thin and light form factor, build quality, and I wanted to take a serious look at OSX Leopard after having so much fun with my iPhone 3G.  Plus I could run Windows apps (I've got Adobe Design Standard CS4 for Windows) with virtualization software.These refreshed Macbooks finally make the lineup truly worth considering for those looking at a Mac over a PC.  Spec wise, these new macbooks are much more comparable to their PC competition (eg. Dell Studio XPS 13).I picked up the 2.53GHz model because with the education discount and free iPod Touch promotion (through Apple), making the jump up to the higher end 13\" was a no brainer.  According to early Macworld speed tests, the performance differences between the two new 13\" MBP models is more than just 2GB RAM.Pros:- Rock solid build quality. My wife's Dell Inspiron 15 feels like a plasticky toy in comparison.- Thin and Light (not quite MacBook Air, but you're not making the same compromises either)- OSX Leopard (and all that entails)- **NEW** Display.  Vastly improved over the previous unibody MacBook. Now on par with 15\" models.  I do find myself adjusting the angle of the display to minimize reflections, but it's not as distracting as people are saying.  It's all a matter of personal preference though. The glass is what enhances the display, so there's the compromise.- SD Card slot.  People are complaining about the 15\" MBP losing the express card slot, but since the 13\" unibody MB never had one, this is an additional port.- Battery.  With the right settings, the battery feels like it can go on forever.  I've pushed the battery life meter to 8 hours...though 6-6.5 hours is more achievable.Cons:- Heat. Under heavy load, the aluminum acts like a radiator and it heats up near the left hinge.- Aluminum susceptible to scratching.  I barely had my MBP for a weekend and there's already a little scratch on the lid.  I'm going to consider a Speck SeeThru Satin to protect it.- Having to figure out how to get the Mac to get access to my PC's printer and external storage...not a real con, but there's an obvious learning curve.", "Date": "June 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Review from an MCSA.", "Author": "M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R2UUB79J2FAMO1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "<!--\n\nfunction

the record, I am a Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator and a Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist.  I've used PCs since before what we know of as \"Windows\".  I have used multiple operating systems and servers from Microsoft over the years, and I am a TechNet subscriber.  I also work in an IT/Desktop Support role at my place of business, which is 100% Microsoft.  I have four PCs - my work Dell, my Gateway P-7805u FX Edition (lovingly referred to in this review as \"Big Poppa\"), my Gateway netbook from Verizon Wireless, and an Acer AspireRevo that is basically a media server. I have built PCs, troubleshot PCs, installed, configured, and reconfigured PCs, and work with virtual machines all day long.But something was missing.  As much as I love every machine I own, something was missing.  I'm not new to Apple - my first personal computer was an Apple IIc, where I wrote my first Hello World program in BASIC.  At school I used Apple IIe computers where the Games folder was restricted by the teachers.  My mother then bought a Mac Performa from the MacMall that used to be in San Diego in the late 80's/early 90's for 2000 bucks, which was my first color computer.  When I started working at 18, my exposure to Macs dwindled as I saw companies were always using PCs.  It was a shock moving to Windows, but I started to see how intuitive the Windows environment really was.  There was a lot of functionality and detail that allowed me to control my environment like Mac never would allow me to do.  In the back of my mind I wanted to return to the world of Mac, if for nothing else than the lower maintenance required versus Windows.  I never could, because Macs never dropped price.  The Performa my mother bought back in the late 80's had 64MB of RAM, a 200MB hard drive (I think), no Ethernet, no wireless, just a built in 56k modem, and a color screen with a plain CD drive and 3.25\" floppy drive.  It was heavy and ugly.Nowadays, Apple is selling iMacs and Mac Pros for roughly around the same price as what they used to sell them for.  People continue to buy Macs because they're easy to use for the basic home user, but for the advanced IT person it just wasn't practical.  But then it all turned upside down; Mac OS (formerly System) went to a more open format, based on standards like Unix, which opened the door for developers to create applications that worked just as good as the Windows counterpart.  Not all is perfect, but it's a step in the right direction, and I wanted a piece.  Apple started to cut prices on its MacBook Pro line, and it was finally time to reconsider a return to Mac.  But it had to be right - I needed my Windows environment.And here I am.You'll want to understand the differences between the various MacBooks.  You can get a regular white MacBook for a grand.  In terms of power it's average; it's not going to shock you with its speed, but it will get basic jobs done.  You shouldn't have to be too concerned about email or browsing, it'll handle those just fine.  Snow Leopard strives to improve on things found in the previous version (Tiger) by making efficient use of the power afforded to it by the hardware, and because it's based on the newer operating system core, it's extremely fast and durable.  The next step up is the MacBook Pro line, the aluminum unibody.  You've likely heard about this line as the premier part of the laptops from Apple, and for good reason.  From little things like aesthetic lighting to larger things like full LED screens that are vibrant and easy to read, the MacBook Pro line is where you want to go when you have more demands than the basic MacBook can handle, like virtualization and multi-tasking.The MacBook Pro 13\" comes in two flavors; the 12 hundred bucks version has a 2.26GHz processor and less hard drive space, whereas this one, the 2.53GHz processor and larger hard drive not withstanding, is 3 hundred bucks more.  Whether you really need the increased size and space is a matter of discretion on your part; if you're running VMs you should really opt for the larger version.  What determines the need to run VMs?  Migration, and that's what my review focuses on...migrating from PC to Mac.I've had Big Poppa since my birthday last year.  It's a beast of a laptop, boasting monster specs and touting itself to be a gaming laptop.  For me I just needed the power to run the intensive applications I threw at it - and for the most part it took them like a pro.  The problem with Big Poppa is that I relied on it so much as a desktop replacement that I did not consider its impact as an actual laptop - it weighs nearly 10 pounds by itself and doesn't fit into many bags.  The screen was large and vibrant, but might have been causing me eye strain trying to take in all of the real estate.  It was also a fingerprint magnet - something I didn't mind, actually.  It ran hot because of the abuse I was putting it through, and it never shut down or overheated due to its cooling, but it got annoying having to hear its fan during these times.  It was then I decided to invest in a MacBook Pro, a smaller machine.This MacBook has identical specs to Big Poppa, except for the screen resolution and size, of course.  Where Big Poppa is nearly 10 pounds, the MacBook Pro clocks in at nearly half the weight.  I had my concerns about the real estate of the screen versus the 15\", but in actually using the laptop it doesn't feel cramped at all.  This is mostly due to the various zoom and sizing options found on the applications with just a swipe of the finger.  Those familiar with iPod and iPhone will already know these gestures, such as pinching.  Some feel like gimmicks to me - like the Expose app - but that's probably because Windows has no such feature and thus I find no need for it.  What was really impressive was the speed of Mac OS on the MacBook.  From dusk to dawn it only slowed down on two occasions, both of which are preventable, and performed significantly faster than Windows on Big Poppa with the same hardware.My plan for migration was to load up my Big Poppa configuration into a VM and move it to Mac, running it in VMWare Fusion going forward.  This plan fell through, because none of the Mac applications I tried were able to effectively get this done.  I tried the Parallels Transporter, VMWare Fusion's conversion agent, and even various backup and imaging solutions that VMWare claimed were compatible, but no matter what I tried, the Mac side would not import the file.  I was finally forced to build a new VM with the same OS and processor, and do Windows Easy Transfer.  Of course, I lost all of my applications and will have to reinstall them.  A word of warning to anyone wanting to make this transition - it is NOT as easy as it should be.  After researching it appears there were two issues working against me.  First, it seems the migration tools aren't friendly with 64-bit operating systems.  Since these are quite prevalent these days this was distressing - and the MacBook Pro's Core 2 Duo is a 64 bit compatible processor, by the way.  Second, if you have more than one OS installed on separate partitions, it will fail unless you migrate them all, even if you only want one.  This is because it reads the whole drive, not the partition, and will freak if you try to limit it.  In Windows it's smart enough to know that you selected a single partition and will take action, but the Mac side does not have the same intuition.If you choose the VMWare or Parallels route, you'll be able to not only share documents and files seamlessly between the environments, but also applications.  So you can dock your Windows applications and they will launch in the VM when you need them, so you don't have to fire up the VM every time you just want to load one application or one file.  Also, if you open a Windows document stored on your Mac, it can launch the Windows application from the VM.  Using VMWare's Unity mode or Parallels Crystal mode, you can even set it to where these documents and applications open directly in Mac without the need for the VM to be visible.  Windows 7 has an analog to this called XP Mode, and it's quite useful if you need that compatibility (which you will).Startup and Shutdown times on Mac OS are a fraction of Windows 7.  Because things only load on startup when you want them to, and because there is no \"registry\" to preload, nor are there applications that have auto-starting DLLs, it means you are never tethered to the machine for extended periods waiting to get to the desktop.  As I said, if you're a quick-and-dirty browsing/email person this computer will do you just fine - but then, I would consider the computer significantly overpriced for such an application.There are some other issues.  Like the fact that Snow Leopard does not seem to understand what \"hot swap\" means.  In Windows XP and above, you can configure the OS to allow certain storage media types to be hot swappable, meaning you can plug and unplug them at will without risk of data loss for the most part via USB or SD card slots.  Snow Leopard yells at you for unplugging a device without using the right click --> Eject function.  This is seriously annoying and I can't express to you all of the reasons why.  The whole benefit of USB in particular is the idea that I don't have to eject it.  It's not an IDE, SATA or SCSI device.  This one nitpick slows down my entire process and forces me to consider other options besides USB - like networked devices.An eSATA port would have been nice, as Big Poppa came with one and I learned to love the increased speed of transfers.  USB is down to about 15-20MB/second, eSATA is anywhere from 50-100MB/second.The touchpad is going to take getting used to and in some ways I wish Mac had stuck with the two button format, even if only as an alternate option.  The problem isn't the gestures, it's the click.  The entire pad is a button and you can configure one corner to be a \"right click\", but the problem is that those who are accustomed to just tapping the pad (not me...I hate tapping) will get frustrated with the notion that they now have to press harder to get commands to submit.  This is especially problematic when navigating folder structures where multiple double clicks are necessary - what a nightmare.Speaking strictly about the laptop itself, the build quality is solid and it doesn't feel like there are any overly loose parts, although I do find the case design itself to be uninspired.  Speck offers a clear case, located here: Speck MacBook 13\" See-Thru Hard Case - CLEAR which, when applied, gives the laptop a clear aesthetic appeal that is reminiscent of the Mac Mini and the old iMac computers; no idea why they have not designed them this way by default.  The screen hinge is large and centered instead of the classic two-prong variety and feels solid, but the screen moves way too easily for my taste.  If you lift the laptop by the wrist pad, the screen flops around loosely; something I'm not used to given none of my other laptops do it.  I assume they made it easily movable to appeal to those who complain that laptops are hard to open.You will notice the laptop is extremely quiet with day-to-day regular usage.  It won't turn on the fan hardly at all unless you're doing something intensive.  These are the times you might notice slowdowns - for example, when working in VMWare Fusion, I ran a Windows Experience rating and the laptop was brought to its knees. As I type this, I'm processing a video for this review and the fan came on, getting progressively louder as it continues its process.  This isn't unusual for computers, but you should realize that while it will be quiet for a basic user, you will hear some noise as you start putting it through its paces.Some have commented on the glossiness of the screen.  I find it annoying only because of the way the screen was designed.  Because it's an entire uniform glass surface, it means the reflective nature of the screen is not shielded in any way like with PCs where there is a non-reflective bezel.  In other words, on the PC you'd have to be directly in the way of the sunlight or other lighting in order for it to affect you; on the MacBook Pro it's apparent no matter what you do or where you sit.  Clearly Apple tried to counter this by using the LED screen's depth and saturation, but it doesn't work in a brightly lit environment.  At night it's a thing of beauty, of course.  Just keep in mind that it's not designed for outdoor working at all; there are some antiglare overlays, but unless you got the model from Apple that has it built in, it's going to look like a poor alternative.In short, the MacBook Pro is a solid laptop - still somewhat overpriced, not nearly as much as before, but it is...and your migration path away from PC might be difficult if you were a heavy PC user.  If you've never used Mac before you'll want to read all of the documentation you can because you will need to learn most simple things from scratch (Print screen anyone?).  If you've used Mac before you should be able to get back into it fairly easily, though some things have changed and not all for the better.  I would definitely recommend VMWare Fusion if you are considering a migration, so you can still have Windows available when you need it.  There are some things that Windows can give you that Mac OS can't - applications that don't have a Mac version.", "Date": "February 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "A jewel with imperfections", "Author": "T.

It's not glossy like the plastic screen of the white macbook, but a mirror-polished glass surface that gives much brighter reflections. If you're sensitive to motion sickness, this may create mild headaches and nausea because each eye sees a different reflection, and the reflection bounces if you're typing on an unsteady surface. Couple this with the brightness or cold grayness of the LED backlighting and a slight 30Hz flicker (which I measured using a solar cell and oscilloscope) and you have potential problems.Some people have complained of burning, achy eyes, and headaches and slight queasiness. You can somewhat minimize the problem by turning brightness down to half, calibrating using advanced settings with gamma around 2.0 and color temps around 6300k, but the reflections will still be an issue. Yet other people have no problems at all. Just take this into consideration, as it can be a deal breaker: what's the point of having a powerful beautiful machine if you can't even use it for more than ten minutes at a time...So, if the screen works for you, you'll be thrilled with this machine. If you are sensitive and get eye strain and worse, then you'll regret your purchase.

People can get a little crazy about their reviews and preferences, and I want to state that this is just that - a review. My decision to buy a Mac was a preference - there is not just one computer out there that is right for everyone. I also want to note that I upgraded to 4 GB of RAM and a 250 GB hard drive.Pros:Absolutely amazing battery life (when I was trying to kill it for calibration, it lasted 5.5 hours - and it wasn't calibrated yet!)Very fast - takes less than a minute to turn on fullyGreat size and weight - I don't even notice the difference in the screen from my 15\" Acer, but I do notice the drastic weight difference!Very, very well-made - when I first picked it up, it felt a tad heavier than I thought it would be for its size, but that's just because it's so solidly built. My old laptop had more flex.Trackpad is great and easy to useIt does not get hot, unlike my old computer, which could melt chocolate and burn my legs. If I put it on a blanket, it gets a tiny bit warm (but not uncomfortable at all); if I put a magazine under it on my lap, then it stays as cool as if it weren't running.Super quiet - I can't even tell it's running half the time.The speakers are great, especially considering there are no speakers visible on the computer! I think the sound might come up out of the keyboard.\"Cons\":The trackpad does take some getting used to. Not because of the \"lack\" of a button (the trackpad is the buttong) or the multitouch gestures, but because it's so BIG I keep accidently resting my palm on the side of it, which prevents the pointer from moving! However, I appreciate the big size and am quickly getting used to it.No hibernate. However, you can get a widget from the Apple website for the dashboard called Deep Sleep that enables hibernate - I love it!Can't close the lid without putting the computer to sleep - however, this is probably a good thing to protect the computer from owners like me who would endanger their computer by moving it while the hard disk is spinning.As you can see, all my cons are not really cons - just little differences that are easily fixed or adjusted to.A lot of people are mad about the glossy screen, but I haven't had a problem with it. Yes, there's a bit of a glare, but it's the same amount as on my TV. I can easily ignore it while watching video. I prefer it to my Acer's old traditional, matte, screen, because this one I can easily clean. It's just glass. It even comes with a cleaning cloth.It also comes with a really cool charger. The magnetic connector is nice - I once tripped on the cord of my old computer and it went crashing to the floor! That won't happen now. People have said the cord is too short, but the power brick comes with two attachments: a plug so you can plug the brick itself into the wall, and a cord that makes the adaptor reach farther. I like the choice, and with the extra cord, it's the exact same length as my former adaptor.Others have complained about the edge of the computer hurting their wrists; I have had no problem with this. Granted, I have yet to use it at a desk, which might create a different angle, but the edge hasn't bothered me (and doesn't even feel sharp). I do have small hands and wrists, so that might be why I'm not bothered.Initial start-up takes but a few minutes, and after that, it takes less than a minute for the machine to be up and running. It is NOT hard to get used to a different operating system - if you just fiddle around for a few minutes, you can find out everything you need to know. If that is the only thing keeping you from buying a Mac, no worries. You can do it.If you think you want this computer, you will not be sorry! I did not choose it for its looks but it is pretty - I'm almost afraid to use it, it's so nice! If you are willing to sacrifice some battery life or size for price, then you can get a PC for less that will fit your needs. I was just not willing. Besides, with the recent drop in price, the student discount, the free iPod that I sold to defray the cost, and the free printer, this computer only ended up being about $100 more than the other PCs I was considering that only had 4 of the 5 things I wanted in a computer(13- or 14-inch display, under 5 pounds, fast processor, great battery life, well-made and durable).", "Date": "August 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent 13\" Laptop Choice", "Author": "Lovethefuture", "ReviewID": "R30NF9U1TY7M3D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "* I should start this review with a warning. I had a major issue with my Macbook Pro, which I detail in the last paragraph of this review. I have not let this issue affect my rating for this laptop because I believe my situation is rare and not to be expected with the majority of 13\" Macbook Pro's purchased.The 13\" Macbook Pro is an excellent choice for consumers looking for a portable, sturdy, beautiful, and easy computer to work with. The build of this laptop is by far the nicest you'll find of the 13\" variety. At 4.5 lbs this laptop is very easy to carry around. Perfect for a college campus or someone who is often on the go with their laptop. The screen is glass from edge to edge, providing rich and vibrant colors. With wifi on, bluetooth off, Itunes open, and some email along the way, I was able to squeeze out 5 hours on a single charge. VERY impressive. Firewire 800 has been included now on the Macbook Pro which is excellent if you plan to use your computer for video editing, etc. Also, Leopard as an operating system is fantastic and blows Vista out of the water.The only thing that I wasn't thrilled about on this laptop is the glossy screen. Glossy is a love/hate thing for me. The glass screen looks fantastic when the sun goes down, but indoors you need to be very careful during the day if you are sitting in a room that has sunlight coming through it. Glossy is notorious for picking up glare in said situations, so be warned. The truth is matte screens are more rare these days in laptops, so this is often an issue for any laptop you will purchase. If you want a Macbook Pro and want to go for a matte screen, it is an $50 additional charge and only available on both the 15\" and 17\" models via Apple's online store.Now to the issue I had with my Macbook Pro. Be warned, I don't believe this is a common issue, however from reading online forums like Mac Rumors and Apple's, other users have had this problem too. My Macbook Pro would often get the dreaded \"beach ball\" a couple times every hour. It would last for about 20 seconds during very simple applications like web browsing. My laptop also made numerous clicking noises when I would move the laptop side to side. This is an issue with the sensor motion. I ended up returning my Macbook Pro because I've read this issue can be found in the 15\" an 17\" models too. Again, this should not be a concern to you, but just be careful in case your Macbook Pro has the same problem I had.", "Date": "August 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Okay, not impressed.

Franzel", "ReviewID": "R2XIYRKERGFJNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using Windows machines for about the last 20 years.  For a change, I decided to try the Mac in late 2009 for a home machine, as I wasn't impressed with any of the PC/Win Vista laptop offerings at the time.  I use the Mac just about every day as a home computer for mail, surfing, photo organization, etc.  I also continue to work on a Windows machine at work - meaning I have to switch between the two daily.  A few main points I would like to share:1) Need to run Windows with BootCamp, Parallels, or VMWare - I purchased VMWare thinking I would need it, but haven't even installed it yet.  Most everything I need comes with the Mac, or is available on the Internet for free.  In fact, I have not purchased any software for the Mac, other than a word processor / spreadsheet application.  All file formats I use and/or create (PDF, DOC, XLS, JPG) can be passed between my Windows work machine and Mac w/o issues.2) The small form factor of this laptop, within the aluminum case make this a joy to fold up and carry around.  With any of the Windows laptop I have used, when you unfold the machine and start to use it again (waking from standby), you are not sure if the machine will wake up correctly, be connected to the Internet, etc.  The Mac works flawlessly in this respect, in that you open it and its ready to go in a few seconds.3) The screen / video is great.  I am sure you can get the same screens and video hardware in Windows based laptops, but you will have to pay a bit more.  Thus, for the hardware you get, you don't a lot more for the Mac than Windows PC (at least for the 13\" model)4) The machine is quiet, and you never hear the fan running.  I laugh as I write this as my wife's Toshiba fan is kicking in, making this terrible whirling noise.5) The touch pad is large, about twice the size of a typical Windows laptop.  This large size makes the OSX 'gestures' usable, for scrolling pages windows, moving back and forward, etc.  Once you get familiar with the gestures, its makes the laptop experience a lot better.  I find myself not needing the external mouse, and never use one.  One problem though, when I move to my Windows laptop, and by habit do the same gestures, w/o luck ;)6) OSX versus Windows - I think both are great OS's.  I will say though that the Mac/OSX environment is much more controlled, and this is where the advantage comes in for stability and performance.  Think about the fact that Windows must support 1000's of different hardware types, including device drivers for all of these.  The chances of instability, conflicts, etc. is quite high.  With the Mac, the hardware is very limited and specific, allowing developers to focus and test much better, with the results being a more stable platform.7) Applications - Windows has many more choices of applications.  However the limited number of applications available for the Mac is also sometimes a blessing as they are integrated better, and play nicely to together.  Take for example iPhoto integrated with iMovie, etc.  This become even more important if you have an iPhone, as you want to have a smaller set of 'good' applications playing nicely together.8) Mac Keyboard shortcuts - if you don't use a mouse, keyboard shortcuts make things happen much more quicker.  Mac has a lot of support for keyboard shortcuts, and you can do just about anything with a keyboard shortcut.  This makes the usability and experience much better, you just need to learn the shortcuts.9) Reliability - I have read some reviews both on Amazon and professional.  A computer is a computer, and if you abuse it, it will break.  Hard drives are hard drives, used both in Windows and Mac PCs.  Eventually they do fail, and the harder you are on your laptop (moving, shaking, bumping), the quicker they will fail.  The same goes for other components, great care is required to get maximum life.10) Support - While never needing support from Mac, I have read that its probably the best in the industry.  Combine that will the Apple Store, where you can walk in, and talk to a real person who understands English.  For anyone who is not that familiar with working with computers, this is a huge advantage.In summary, for the standard computer user who is not an IT wizard, the Mac Book makes a lot of sense.  Yes, the price of a Mac is higher, but if you combine the better stability along with the better support from Apple, its money well spent.", "Date": "April 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great computer....not for everyone", "Author": "Stephen E.

Being a college student/small business owner I need to be able to have this flexibility. I've owned about 4 laptops which have all helped to feed my workaholic lifestyle. I rely on my laptop so much that I don't have an entertainment center, my cd's are boxed up, my encyclopedias are never used, my file cabinet rarely gets used, and I don't have a personal secretary.Typically I go and buy a cheap/mid range computer which usually works just fine for me, but they usually wear out very quickly.

I've had several friends who have been very pleased with their macbooks and macs because of the organization/computing power. So I decided to finally jump the gap and buy a macbook.I'm pleased... The computer is great, battery life is good and the operating system makes perfect sense for someone who needs organization help.

Yes, you might say that the computer is simple and boring, and that would be true if you were expecting the computer to alleviate boredom. However, if you use your computer like I do, then you will be pleased that the computer seems to only do what you want it to do and nothing more.So if you use your computer as a tool to simplify and organize your life, buy the macbook.

I have built PC's from scratch as a teenager, worked in hardware, troubleshooting, etc and know a PC inside-out. I had tried using a Mac in 2003 and was so frustrated after 2 weeks that I planned to never use one again. Well, fast forward to 2009 and I wanted to buy a new laptop to replace my trusty 6 year old Dell Latitude that was giving me trouble. As I wanted a lighter laptop, I decided to stick to the 13\" screen. After lots of research I narrowed the choice between the Dell XPS 13 and the Macbook Pro 13. After further deliberation, bugging friends for their advice and spending time at the Apple and Microsoft store (yes, we have one in Phoenix!), I decided to take the plunge and buy the Macbook Pro.I have not used a Windows laptop since that day 2 months ago!! This is by far the best laptop or computer I have ever owned! One of my major concerns before I switched was adjusting to a new OS and learning stuff all over again. Let me tell you this: Apple is a very smart company and has made their OS so much simpler for a Windows person to use when compared to at least 6 years ago. No wonder so many people like me have switched sides and are continuing to switch everyday. I had planned to use this laptop for 2 weeks at least before I returned it because of frustration. I thought that it was a fair amount of time to get used to a new OS. In reality, it took me about 10 minutes to get used to it!! It was that easy and intuitive. I have waited until today to write this review as I was trying to find a list of things that did not work on this laptop or things that frustrated me. There are a couple of minor pet peeves (Eg: the 2 USB slots are so close together, that only one can be used at a time with most devices; the laptop does get hot on the left side near the screen when using for extended periods of time) but they are not huge deterrents. Everything else has been like magic. I am amazed at how fast this baby wakes up from sleep. 2 seconds!! Yes, that's right, I said 2 seconds. Anyways, there's so many things in the MBP (Macbook Pro) that just make everyday computing simpler and you can read about them in other reviews or on Apple's site.One thing I would like to mention is the new trackpad. It is a thing of sheer genius! Once you use it, you will never want to use a normal laptop trackpad any more. The different finger gestures are so intuitive and easy and will take you about 2 minutes to get used to.I guess this review is mainly to convince others like me who have always used a PC and are fairly technical/advanced users of it that you too can make the switch. The 2 things I would ask anyone seriously thinking about switching to do are:1. Go to Apple's website and watch the \"Switching to a Mac\" and \"Basics of a Mac\" video learning guides before you buy a Macbook. You don't need to watch all of them but watch as many as you can. It will greatly reduce your frustration in the first 10 minutes of opening a computer with an OS that you have never used.2. Buy \"Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Missing Manual\" by David Pogue after you buy the MBP. Mac OS X Snow Leopard: The Missing ManualI bought mine on Amazon for about $15. It is well worth the money. Pogue has written a gem and reading it has helped me discover so many things about the MBP and Snow Leopard that I would not have otherwise learnt. Shortcuts, guides, how-to's, cool features, hidden things, etc. You name it, the book has it. Like the title suggests, the book should come packaged with every MBP.This is my first review on Amazon and although I have bought tons of stuff in the past, I was never so passionate about something to ever write a review.

Having used the White MB (Late 2007 release) in the past, the differences between the two in terms of quality are immense.The White MB I owned was a poor quality product, the polycarbonate body was prone to cracking, it suffered random hardware failures for no reason and the screen on it was horrible - pathetic viewing angles and color reproduction.On the other hand, the MB PRo feels like a high quality product (externally) The Unibody construction process has resulted in a computer that feels built to last. These are the features that make it a compelling purchase.The LCD screen. It is glossy and that can be a problem in certain environments but the MB Pro screen has a 60% greater color gamut and it beats the MB screen in terms of black levels, color depth and accuracy.The glass trackpad is a pleasure to use for navigation due to it's design.  Unlike the old MB Pro trackpads, this is a single large glass trackpad with no visible buttons - the whole trackpad can be used as a button once it's configured in System preferences. Scrolling, clicking and dragging all happen effortlessly once you're used to it and, once you're used to it, it will be hard to go back to using regular or smaller sized trackpads on other notebooks.Firewire 800 is another addition - for media professionals who need a better and faster way to transfer data than USB 2.0Bluetooth 2.1 - easy to transfer your phone data to the macbook by using bluetooth.SD Card slot - finally Apple realizes that consumers may want a convenient way to download their photos or videos without using an external card reader. An SD card slot is built in - tough luck for Pro's who uses other card formats or who need an express card slot but something is better than nothing.Backlit keyboard wth chiclet keys - good for typing in dark rooms and comfortable to use for long periods of time.Built in battery - 7 hours of power as advertised by Apple, your mileage may vary but it allows you to be mobile for 5 to 6 hours. It's an Inbuilt battery so once it's exhausted, it's back to the Apple store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider for replacement. However, Apple states that the battery will hold 80% of it's charge for up to a 1000 charges which means approximately 3 to 4 years of daily use. So it should be a while before you have to go in for that battery replacement.A few things to take into account before you make your decision  -Whatever you do, please buy the Applecare.Protection.Plan AppleCare Protection Plan - For Portable Apple Computers 13.3 Inches and Below. Unfortunately what most customers don't know before they buy their first Apple computer is that if you don't have Applecare and a product malfunction occurs after the first year, the repair / replacement charges are much higher than other PC makers in most cases.Apple's products are as prone to failure as any other  PC because Apple sources components from manufacturers just like every other PC maker. But If something goes wrong with a Mac, and you don't have the A.P.P, you'll be paying exorbitant fees for getting the hardware repaired.  Keep in mind, the A.P.P. only covers hardware failure - not accidental damage so it's still expensive for what you get but it's better than paying Apple's prices for repair/replacement parts.You will also NEED to upgrade your ram from 2 gb to 4gb if you plan to do any image processing or video editing.With the standard 2gb of ram, my machine starts to stutter the moment I try to open up a large image file and listen to music simultaneously. That's being cheap on Apple's part, considering a customer has just bought a computer for $1200 and it has only 2 gb of ram. This is not a netbook, its supposedly a \"PRO\" notebook. For the ram, that will be another 80 to 100 dollars.Crucial CT2KIT25664BC1067 4GB 204-PIN PC3-8500 SODIMM DDR3 Memory KIT (2GBx2)If you're a datajunkie, the 160 gb that Apple includes with the MB Pro is woefully inadequate so factor in another 80 to 120 dollars based on the hard drive you may buy to replace the stock drive withThe MB Pro has a mini display port, you'll have to buy a MiniDP to VGA convertor or MiniDP to DVI convertor if you ever feel like connecting your MB Pro to a larger monitor - since Apple is nice enough not to include it with the machine it will cost you $30 more IF you buy it from Apple. Here's a cheaper option - Mini DisplayPort to DVI Female Adapter Cable for Apple Macbook, Macbook Pro, iMac, Macbook Air, Mac Mini LaptopYour total cost would actually be $1200 + $200 A.P.P + $80 RAM = 1480 dollars + applicable taxes. I'm counting the ram as a mandatory upgrade if you want to avoid a sluggish user experience.Taking all of that into account, the machine is still good for me - well built, fairly capable and it works well. It could have been great if Apple stopped diluting a supposedly premium product experience by being cheap and skimping on the ram and hard drive capacity. However, if you are buying a 13 inch MB Pro I recommend buying the standard 13 inch MB Pro instead of the high end MB Pro 13 inch and upgrding the hard drive and ram yourself.

However, when I'm on the road, or simply away from my desk, I want to have a really powerful notebook, but keep some degree of portability.  The 13-inch MacBook Pro fills that solution, for me, perfectly.For years, I had used a 12-inch Powerbook G4, to fill that mobile computing need, but it had become so much slower than my intel based desktop computer, so it was time for an intel based Mac notebook.I chose the slightly faster model, but it has proven to be so fast, that I am certain the cheaper MacBook Pro 13-inch would be nearly as good.  Thank goodness Apple has finally included the backlit keyboard on the lower priced Pro model, while not always a necessity, it is one of those ultimate cool factors, to see your keyboard light up under low light levels.The SD card slot will get those pictures from your digital camera to your computer faster than ever.  It always felt clunky to me, to hook up the cable, and I am already appreciative of popping the SD card right from camera to notebook.  The return of firewire 800 to the 13-inch model was also a key for me upgrading because firewire is still very common in external hard drives, and it allows for convenient firewire target mode, for transferring settings and preferences between Macs.Finally, it was the right time for me to buy because the computer comes with OS X Leopard.  Snow Leopard will be out in September, but it will cost only $29, so it was not worth waiting several months, to save only $29.  I save that much by simply buying from Amazon whenever possible.Overall, this MacBook Pro 13-inch has fully impressed me.  The build quality is amazing, and I do not think anyone could find a more solid notebook computer anywhere.  What I love about this generation of notebooks is that you do not have to sacrifice much performance, when you are on your notebook.  In truth, my model actually has a slightly faster processor than my 18-month old iMac, and I can tell this difference when encoding video and doing other intensive tasks.  The integrated Nvidia graphics in the notebook while not earth shattering are the best integrated graphics that have ever been in a notebook.While long requested, the display of this notebook is finally somewhat higher quality as well.  I have no complaints with it.I'm certain this MacBook Pro will serve my computing needs for a long time to come, and do that while being such a beautiful and fun experience along the way too.

But for the most part it is true. Yes the first day or so I had some choice words for my new MBP. But now, everyday I am more amazed what this thing can do. A lot of thought went into the design of this computer. The speed of just shutting it on and off his truly remarkable. In the morning I would turn on my HP, make coffee, and if I was lucky it might have made it to the desktop by the time I got back. I then clicked the Firefox icon and went to the bathroom and read War and Peace. When I got back I was on the internet. I'm not even going to mention email. Suffice to say. It wasn't quick.The other day I went on my wife's HP. It was like stepping out of a Ferrari and into a Model T. Most people, me included, get hoodwinked into believing you get more for your money with a HP, Dell, etc. Yeah you get a bigger screen, more Ram and a bigger Hard Drive. But you also get a plastic piece of crap, constantly updating itself with more crap, capable of catching more viruses then an epidemic of Swine Flu. Honestly; I don't know how the competition stays in business.The bottom line. When you have one company who designs the computer, the OS, browser, and virus protection, built on a rock solid Unix foundation you can't go wrong. My HP ran Windows XP Firefox browser and McAfee virus protection. It was agonizingly slow with loads of compatibility issues.To sum it up...The Mac and the HP... the difference between a spaceman and a caveman.Apple's slogan should be...

I was using a Compaq  running a 2.7 AMD processor yet my Mac with only a 2.26 GHz Intel processor out performs it in many of my benchmarks. The Nvidia 9400M, which uses 256 MB of you systems ram, performs great. The 9400M performs well enough to playback 1080p files on my 42 inch screen perfectly. I am even able to play Need For Speed and World Of Warcraft in Windows using bootcamp with 25-30 Fps in NFS and 55-60 Fps in WOW. Now onto the RAM. This configuration comes equipped with 2 GB of DDR3 RAM. I found that in general applications this was plenty. I upgraded my system with 4 GB of RAM from Crucial, I found apps such as PhotoShop, IMovie, GarageBand and VMware Fusion to run faster. With that said, I suggest upgrading the ram yourself and not paying  apple to do it as they overcharge. With it being able to support up to 8 GB of Ram there is plenty of room for expansion.DesignThe new Macbook Pro is carved out of a single block of aluminum. What that means is that the computer isn't made from multiple layers of plastic of aluminum, it is just one solid piece, which gives the computer a nice sturdy feel. The computer features a chic let style keyboard that is nicely backlit and has a very nice tactile feel to it. The trackpad is just one large, glass covered button. It also supports multitouch very much like the IPhone but also includes a few new ones.  All the Multitouch features are very smooth and responsive. You will find very quickly that it is hard to live without these features but can be disabled if they are not you your cup of tea.ScreenThe screen on the new 13 inch Macbook Pro is simply stunning. The display is led backlit which can give amazing blacks and bright whites. It runs at a resolution of 1280x800. Side by side the new screen is clearly better and has a much better viewing angle  than previous models. If you want to see for your self go to an apple store and play the new Iron Man trailer in 1080p from the website and you will see what I meanPortsThe Macbook Pro has an array of ports. It the MagSafe power port which connects to the computer with a magnetic connection instead of a physical on. So if someone trips over the cable, it breaks away cleanly and wont send you laptop flying across the room. I have broke many power cables on previous machines. Then there is you  ethernet port which is pretty standard. Then is the return of firewire with a firewire 800 port. Then there in the mini Display Port which requires the use of an adapter to connect via HDMI or DVI to a TV. This can be a hassle and wish apple would have used just a HDMI port because the only thing you will find display ports on are Apple products. Moving down the machine you find two usb ports. I wish there were one more Usb port and the current ones were a little spread apart but it was most likely a space issue because when the computer is closed it is just under an inch thick. But moving on you find a SD card slot which is the first time this has been a feature on a Mac. When a SD card is put in it does stick out a bit but I don't find that a problem. Then there is the audio in and out ports which has been combined into just one port. If you plug in the earphones that come with  the IPhone both the earphones and the mic work at the same time. All of these ports I have mentioned ore located on the left and on the right you have a slot loading superdrive (much like the PS3 and Wii) and a Kensington security slot that doesn't block the superdrive but comes very close. And that is it for the ports.BatteryThe battery on the Macbook Pro is simply amazing.

(The best PC laptop on the market, in my opinion is the Sony VAIO Z series with the high res screen option).I recently traded the 15\" for this 13\" and although I greatly miss the 15\" screen and the wonderful speakers on the 15\" (the 13\" speakers are good but not as rich and bassy as the 15\") but overall I love this smaller machine.Let me get what I don't like out of the way:--wish the screen resolution were much higher (compare to the Sony VAIO Z series which has such outrageous screen resolution)--wish it were a bit lighter that 4.5 lbs (although this machine is exceptionally sturdy, so willing to deal with a little bit heavier than similar size machines)And that's it for the wish list.  Now what I absolutely love:--the ergonomics -- way better than anything else out there, PC or Mac.--backlit keyboard, comfortable typing area (feels luxurious to rest your hands on the surface of the textured aluminum area)--fast OS (Snow Leopard), fast machine, great power management--first machine i've owned that doesn't get overly hot, in fact even barely warmWhat I do highly recommend though is to get -- if you can afford it -- is a 256Gb SSD (Corsair).  This gives the machine extra speed, better battery power, and true longevity.  No need to worry about damaging the disk while traveling, defragmenting (oh, so glad that era is over).  This is an expensive option ($650 or so) but really well worth it by a long shot.

I also have another laptop which has Windows and Linux installed on it. I am not an Apple fan, and this is the first and only Apple product I have purchased.The reason I got this machine was the Garageband application. I'm an amateur musician and I wanted to record my band practices, as well as to compose new songs. In that respect, it served the purpose. I'm very pleased with the Garageband application.However, be warned: It takes a while to get used to the Mac OS. It's very different than Windows. Second, do not get rid of your Windows machine. You will need it!This is not a product that once you take it out of the box, everything will work. For instance, I'm from Europe, but MacBook does not play the DVDs from other regions of our global world, something even the cheapest $20 Chinese DVD players can do! (To be more precise, you need to select a region and stick to it). It also keeps giving errors when I try to play any copied DVD. (Just google the words \"mac\" and \"dvd region\" and you'll see a flood of complaints and frustrations) Also, most of my external hard drives do not work with MacBook.In addition, when you connect a camera or handycam to Macbook, it automatically saves those files to a very weird, almost hidden, location. In order for the Apple applications, such as iTunes, iPhoto, etc. to read those files, they have to be at a specific location, which is really annoying. You cannot choose where to put your photos!I find Apple much more controlling than Windows. Its operating system wants you to do things the way they want. Of course, it's more stable, faster, and less vulnerable to viruses, but all that comes with a cost. (The latest version of Windows is also very fast, so I'm not sure if there's a significant difference between Mac and Windows anymore in terms of speed)Overall, do not expect too much. Like all the other Apple products, it looks pretty but it has a lot of limitations. Keep your Windows (or Linux) machine nearby. You may also need to purchase an external DVD player and a new external storage disk. MacBook is pretty but far from being perfect.", "Date": "August 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "My first Mac.

It is difficult to find applications (Spotlight does not index reliably). I have had to manually re-index the drive several times.- Battery life is not as good as advertised. It is only about 4 hours in normal use. The battery drains much faster than a Windows notebook is \"sleep\" mode.- I tried using iWorks '09 with Excel spreadsheets. Not only is the iWorks software difficult to use compared to MS Office (even my 17-year old daughter agrees), it also corrupts Office files.

It sounded simple, and I did it. I waited 1 hour, and 2 and 3, and then called Amazon again, and they said to wait couple of hours, and I will get it. I waited until 12AM Sep 5th (since I wanted to go out of US, and needed to do this before leaving), and they assured me by the time I am up, I will have that number in my in-box.Next day there was nothing from Amazon, so again I called, and this time I was assured by 5PN that day the number will be there. At 6PM it was there, and I used it and made a 1279 dollars purchase.Amazon tried to put 3 charges, each 1279 through my Bank, therefore they stopped all of them, and I did not know about any since I was out of the country, until Sep10th(which was the date, I was suppose to get the shipment delivered to my house0. Again I had to call Amazon for almost 6 more times, and every time some joker was telling me, that let me know your Bank phone number, and we will take care of it, and for 4 days this went on, and on. I called Amazon again, since daily I was getting e-mails from them saying my order has not gone through, because of insufficient funds in my account. I called, and asked the rep what is going on, and after her trying not to answer my questions, she said let's call your Bank, and talk to them directly(I am not sure if you have tried to call your bank directly these days or not, but it is not an easy task) but we did anyhow, and my bank's rep told the Amazon rep, that the reason the charges were denied, has been the quantities of them, and she said in the past 2 days alone, Amazon has requested 5 times, the amount of 1279 dollars(If you remember I bought it a 500 gift certificate, and the true charge should have been 779 dollars), so I told my bank give a verbal OK with Authorization number to Amazon Rep and let's get this thing resolve once and for ever, and when she tried, Amazon refuse to accept it, and told me that I have to cancel my order and order this again, and when I asked her to let me talk to your manager, and why did you ask to have my bank online, if you knew that later on you will refuse their Authorization, she put me on eternal hold, and then I got cut off.So I tried to cancel my order, but the system would not let me, so I called Amazon again, and asked to talk to a manager, and every time you call you have to tell your whole story otherwise you will not get an opportunity to talk to a manager. When I told him that, he said no Robert, you do not have to do this, and we are putting your order through, and charge you 779(since I did lose 7 days by then I upgraded the shipping, and after 500 dollars gift certificate, my charge out of my bank account raised to 809.00), and he said he will e-mail me about our talk, and this amount, and do not worry about anything Robert, TRUST ME.Believe it or not I never got an e-mail, and on Sunday 13th, Amazon went ahead and charged my account more than 1300 dollars, and since I did not expected them they will do that, and I got assured the total amount after 500 dollars gift certificate will be 809.00, I went ahead, and used my ATM card for other purposes. Amazon by doing that caused my account to be over drafted and I ended up getting 100 dollars bank fee for that reason alone.So what did I do today? Guess. Called Amazon again (this was my 17th times, since Sep 4th). They said that Amazon Gift department somehow missed giving me credit for 500 dollars, and therefore 1309 dollars went through my account instead of 809 dollars, and it will be 10 days until they can resolve this.I wish Jeff Bezo will know these types of horror stories happening to his loyal customers.
