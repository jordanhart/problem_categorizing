I have 2 other computers that have been factory refurbished & that have always worked good. Factory refurbished from Dell usually has the same warrenty with refurbished as a new one. The computer I got had a very noisy hard drive and was the definition of slow. It functioned this way until it quit in late Feb. I notified the seller on March 2nd, 2013. I was told it sounded like the hard drive and for only $49.00 I would get a replacement. I got the used replacement, which was just as slow & nearly as noisy, I put it in. So when it quit again on April 24th, I was told it sounded like the hard drive, again, and for only another $19.00 I would get another.  When it quit after it's 3rd start up, I was told if I sent the computer back, it would cost only $40.00 to fix whatever is wrong with it. Not much of a deal after all, huh? Factory refurbished?

Installing Ubuntu 11.10, 4-Disks DVD Installation and Reference Set, Ed.2012 was relatively simple except that I had to go find and install the internal wireless adapter drivers.  I had recently purchased a more recent model Inspiron and had had no issues installing Ubuntu so I was hoping for no hiccups here.
