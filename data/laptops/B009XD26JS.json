Works well with windows 8-Windows 8 is really nice with the touchscreen, all the security and all the new features.-definitely worth the money, only 700 when I bought it-beats audio integration is good with the headphones, not so much with the speakerCONS:-Average display, really not that noticeably great but it isn't noticeably bad either. what you expect to get for the price.-Speakers aren't really that great, not for prolonged music listening, but work well.Overall, a great all around laptop for  students, workers and personal use.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "HP", "Author": "William F Caten", "ReviewID": "R16J1B7O9S2UL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this touch screen laptop!! The only problem it has no optical device. It was easy enough to solve with the purchase of a NU Slim USB Multi DVD burner.I realized that I rarely need a optical drive but nice to have around when needed!!", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Enjoying the Touch screen and Ultrabook experience", "Author": "Slippy", "ReviewID": "RD9IFUB2E9HSL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Laptop has been awesome. Had a hard time choosing between a nice tablet or a touch screen laptop. I love using Windows 8 (didn't take too long to figure out). My daughter loves the picture password and the touch screen has enabled my 3yr old son to navigate games without use of the mouse or keyboard.At times I still would love to be able to fold the screen all the way back (Yoga style) and making selections (opening links, folders, files...) with the touch screen doesn't always respond well. I've also had a couple times when the WiFi wasn't working even with a connection and good reception.Overall, I love it.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Product failed after three months", "Author": "Jeff Krueger", "ReviewID": "R35H3WS7X6IH6D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In the middle of working on this ultrabook it turned off and never came back.  Calls to tech support were difficult (offshored support).  They insisted that the power brick failed. Unfortunately the ultrabook was fully charged and was not plugged in.  It would appear the motherboard has failed.  Does anyone wonder why the \"PC\" market is hurting?  It's not just tablets, or mobile, but quality and useability.  The overall product, when working, is very good.  Windows 8 is questionable as a useable operating system.  Develop something easy to use and compelling from a productivity standpoint and people will come (i.e., Apple).  The device is under warranty and HP will fix; why didn't I spend the extra money to get a MacBook!  Hey HP - high school students are paying attention and they might be your next set of customers...probably not.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP Envy", "Author": "Shawna", "ReviewID": "R1GUPRMXBFQOGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this Ultrabook for a few months now and I love it! :) it does everything I need without any issues.
