I did not like it at first and my wife had no idea how to use it, as it comes standard with windows 8. I ended up formatting the hard drive and installing my trusty old window 7 and life has been good.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for my mom", "Author": "Christine Boynton", "ReviewID": "RZJQO3XVZJDKA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased a 10 inch tablet and it just did not work for her - no real key board and going from a 15\" laptop to 10\" tablet screen just was to frustrating.  So back it went and instead went larger and up to date with this excellent laptop from dell.  Clean, quick processing, excellent screen with 900 pixels instead of 700, and lastly don,t let windows 8 scare you.  The new dash board style is easy to learn and I honestly think a touch screen would even complicate it for her (65).So bottom line she loves it and I am happy too.  Great overall value with good specs and quality from dell.Thanks amazon!", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3rd Generation Intel Core i3-3227U Processor (3M Cache, 1.9 GHz)\n6 GB DDR3 RAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n17.3-Inch Screen\nWindows 8", "Name": "Dell Inspiron 17 i17RM-2258sLV 17.3-Inch Laptop (Moon Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41i-ytVucdL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AM7MNHO"}}
