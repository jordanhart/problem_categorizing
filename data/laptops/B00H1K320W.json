The last 4 desktops I have used have been all HP and I received great customer support for each one. PLUS they have all been long lasting.Everything about this laptop works for me. The integrated graphics bug me a little, but I'm not specifically using it for gaming anyways.I am mainly using this laptop for 2 reasons:-Capturing video/audio (Which is why I went for a 750GB)-And portability for when I'm not at home.If you don't need the extra Hard drive space, go for a cheaper version of the HP 2000. However, definitely go with HP for the quality.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beware update to 8.1 process", "Author": "Richard E. Fischer", "ReviewID": "RUP0C906P4ICV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I spent several hours trying to get this thing to update to 8.1, including interminable hold time with HP support.  Never could implement.Amazon, though, is terrific with this sort of problem.  I was able to return it conveniently and without any hassle.  I seriously doubt a big box store would be so accommodating.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computing speed for the price!", "Author": "Randall L Krause", "ReviewID": "REBP4NIC3JQSO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great product.

I give a little because I ignore the fact that there is no drivers for Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium.  However, if you are in no need of communication or have a spare computer for basic internet and stuffs, you are good to go.  This laptop is just too new for me with the pre-installed Microsoft Windows 8.  So I downgraded it to Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium.  Microsoft has been great with downgrades.  This particular Hewlett Packard allows you to downgrade to Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium as far as I can see.  I believe it is a blessing in disguised since there is no virus.  I recommend downloading tried and true programs on another computer then using that to transfer it over to the laptop.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "MY FIRST LAPTOP, LOVE IT SO FAR AFTER ONLY TWO DAYS", "Author": "Lee A.

IT WAS THE LAST ONE THEY HAD BUT IT HAD SOMEOTHER GOODIES BUNDLED W/ IT.  WE FELT THAT IT WAS AN EXCELLENT BARGAIN.  WE WERE NOT VERY IMPRESSED W/ THE SALES PERSON.

It is also a quick, zippy machine that is great for browsing the web. To make it run games a little better i would recommend to add an additional 4gb of RAM for that extra boost. This allows you to do more things at once and run higher quality settings. Over all, if a kid wants something to play Minecraft on this is a good Machine", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value for this laptop", "Author": "Latoya Martin", "ReviewID": "R2OEYAB89YZ45F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item is a great value - very reasonably priced for its functionality. It is good for what I need - using various office software programs and downloading/playing music, and Windows 8 is very good (I just need to become more familiar with it, having used Windows 7 previously, and Windows 8 seem substantially different from Windows7). I don't use it so much for video; so, I can't really comment on that.
