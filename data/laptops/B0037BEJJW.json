Krehbiel", "ReviewID": "RQAWG7JMTUKML", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased my D810 with windows XP refurbished from Tampa Laptops.It is a good solid machine. The screen appears to be wider. It is a heavier machine. I notice it on those times when I need to carry it a ways. Not alot but more than some other computers. It has a very solid cabinet. Nice sized keyboard is easy to type on. Once in a while the keyboard gets warm. My battery on this used one is running around 3-1/2 hours on a charge which I consider fine. The battery of course varries on used machines due to it's condition. But this tells you that a good battery runs for a good length of time. I like the machine. I am runing lots of older vintage software like the great Lotus stuff, etc and wanted to upgrade computers but not throw out all my software that won't run on the newer Windows Systems. This was a great purchase at a nice price.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dell d810", "Author": "Jackie Dean Caraway \"sgtch2\"", "ReviewID": "RY5PEL2AM3X0L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great item a little on the large size but sturdy and works great.

The laptop works great, plays movies very well as we use netflix and Hulu with it and you can play games very well also. I liked the price and thought the product was worth the price. We have had it for a couple of months now and I am not technical, but there seems to be no problems other than when we got it, we had to get a new adapter for it as the one they supplied was not working, Other than that, everything was great!!!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "First Lap Top Was A Success", "Author": "journeyman", "ReviewID": "RP46BRS393UFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really didn't know that operating a laptop would be so fun & easy.

I had problems with the D810 (may have been operator error I don't know) but they sent a new one right away.  I needed help getting it set up and one of the guys helped me on a Saturday and had to go into the office to get me up and running!!  I couldn't believe it.  Their communication has been excellent and they are very concerned about having happy customers.  I love my laptop!!  It is refurbished and runs perfectly.  Wish I could give them more than 5 stars I am that happy with this transaction!!", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Non Working System!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "KEVIN FERGUSON", "ReviewID": "R1CCLV6IATPLV0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "non-working system....seller had his personal info/account info stored........not able to WiFi/connected to the internet.... very slow startup and operating system failure.......  also was shipped inappropriately (not packed correctly and was disgustedly filthy and dirty)", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Glad I got this.", "Author": "Loren Edwards \"Ed\"", "ReviewID": "R28PLB1DL5DVE2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Does everything it should.The bottem does get very hot after using it for a long time.The wireless wifi always works.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product and fast service", "Author": "Ken Ace \"Ken\"", "ReviewID": "R86UK79RYW96D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought that for my grandson too.
