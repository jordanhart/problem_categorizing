No random restarts, no hot heat or fast dying battery. Actually the battery lasts a long time for me having the battery setting on \"high performance\" than \"battery saving\". I'm sure the latter feature makes the battery last even longer. The only complaint that I have is the trackpad doesn't always respond, I use touchscreen 90% of the time anyway, even to scroll, but the trackpad has some response issues. I've updated the trackpad software and even messed with the settings and it seems to be much better, but I still wonder if it's a problem with solely my device or if it's an issue with all of the computers. Anyway it's not that huge of an issue, especially since there's a touchscreen but that's all I could think of. Oh also The screen looks great but this computer cannot playback 1080p. The screen won't allow it. 720p Hd is fine though :)Otherwise it's an awesome computer, nice sparkly color, fast and customizable. I highly recommend this as a starter computer or for those like me who just watch videos, use for school, social media, etc.ORIGINAL POST:I bought this through Wal-Mart for Black Friday and had to wait for it to be shipped. I just received it yesterday and I love it. I previously had a MacBook from like 2006 so it was time for an upgrade. I plan to use this for school and home, nothing too crazy like photoshop or editing, but so far it's awesome. The keys and trackpad are taking some getting used to. The trackpad is smaller than my MacBook's and the keys feel different as well, but I'm sure I'll get used to it. Multi-tasking and the touchscreen are a breeze! I barely use the trackpad. Although I have only had it for 24 hours, I have ran into no hiccups. I've already updated the software, downloaded apps, multi-tasked, watched YouTube, connected it to my printer, taken a photo, etc and have had not the slightest of issues. The computer seems to run very fast and smooth and is quite quiet too! It's much lighter and thinner than my MacBook as well. The Dolby Advanced Audio sounds very nice and loud and the screen's quality is nice and crisp. I couldn't be happier and will update my review after a month or so. BTW, I did get this one through Wal-Mart and not Amazon though.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exceeded Expectations", "Author": "Nathan Moore", "ReviewID": "R6A35JQ6LH7BJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my HP Pavillion TouchSmart on Cyber Monday for a price that I assumed to be pretty low (about $360). At the moment, I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Granted, for $360, I can't expect the computer to last too long. But as someone who mainly uses my home PC for social media, reading articles and watching Netflix, I think I got a pretty good deal!", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "so far so good and I like it", "Author": "Ronito101 \"$$$$$$\"", "ReviewID": "R5682M00E5VIC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good Laptop.

So, I was really excited about this item when I first saw it on Amazon sold by another provider and the price seemed just right. However, when I realise there was no DVD port, I was a bit disappointed but I figured I will just have to deal with it. I did not have much time to spend checking out it's features until the next day. When I did, I realised that the camera won't work; kept getting a message that said, No cam detected, if you are using an integrated camera, please turn on or install a camera. I was so frustrated. I knew it would be too costly to return the item so I had a few persons and Technician take a look at it, but it was no use. I was told I will have to get an external Cam. Boy! then I was upset. So I emailed Amazon and I'm telling you; these people mean business! They got in contact with the provider, sort everything out and they decided to grant me a partial refund to assist me financially in sorting out the issue.Sometimes, products on Amazon may be faulty but \"AMAZON\" makes the difference! They are reliable, professional, customer pleasing, caring, they act fast and man they have made me one proud and happy customer! Amazon is amazing. Word of advise to customers... always read reviews before purchasing items, simple... It's the best way!Additional two stars are for AMAZON customer care REPS.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "JackiO", "ReviewID": "R2WF8FJ238RHO6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, I find this to be one of the best values in the marketplace.

It has now been 3 months and I have to say it is a very good laptop. At first I was hesitant because of it having Windows 8 but it is much easier to use than I thought.  It also has the old desktop setting if you really dislike the new Windows 8 set up.  It has everything I need for an amateur video maker and student. At first I was freaking out because it didn't appear to have Windows Word which it doesn't unless you purchase it separately BUT it does have Wordpad which is practically the same as Word and has all the basic and necessary functions. This laptop also has a better version of Movie Maker with a very good microphone/speaker than the previous computers Iv'e had. The touchscreen is decent but it is not like a smartphone touchscreen which I would expect.  I love that it has me sign in with my email account and has Netflix on my desktop and is super easy to access, even easier I should say.  The webcam isn't of spectacular quality but it is decent. Oh. and I LOVE that it has a brightness setting that I can pull up by swiping the left side of the screen, I would despise using my laptop at night because it would be so so bright especially when watching movies.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP Pavillion TouchSmart Computer", "Author": "Marlys", "ReviewID": "RW1QTIW05AF23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There was a mix up on my first shipment.
