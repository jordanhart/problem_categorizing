{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great laptop for the price", "Author": "B. Dunn", "ReviewID": "R1GMZEOH7ISHC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop at Best Buy considering it was only $402 after taxes and i got it in the store Which beats getting it shipped ( since its not considered for amazon prime as i wrote this i would have to pay for shipping as well..)The AMD APU is great value if your not one of those Hardcore gamers but it is great for value. The cheapest Intel i3 that i saw with the Intel HD 4000 was around 500-600 dollar price range ( the only Intel intergrated gpu i would consider buying from intel). It has 2 3.0 USB ports along with a 2.0 USB port along with HDMI which is great if you want to use it on a monitor ( also a VGA i believe. I can play Diablo 3, Wow ( good settings visually) and also Swtor on it so it does a decent job for games if your willing to play most of them on low :)", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Delightful notebook and Windows 8 is really fast", "Author": "William Wilson", "ReviewID": "R1J32MZE62NO1D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a bit reluctant to go with Windows 8, however, the motherboard of my 2007 HP notebook [Windows Vista HP OS] died for the second time, so I decided that a good refurbished HP notebook for $335 was worth trying. Several desktop start-up options were tried; settled on StartIsBack which is a great choice to a desktop start-modification [avoids the Metro start screen boxes]. Speed is very good and everything seems to be working well. Was able to get a 3 yr warranty from HP for $175; the only question I had about the AMD A6-4400M was the operating temperature of the CPU [ranges from around 89 C to 130 C, with average of around 115-119 C; though this is hot, the surfaces of the computer are relatively cool. Even without the up-coming Windows 8.1 modification, I expect the software to have fewer potential glitches than Windows Vista.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quick Review", "Author": "Rhiannan Wallace", "ReviewID": "R37SC2RRFC5SCQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is good. It does all this things I bought it for, is able to handle running pc games and editing software ect.The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because there have been some problems with the windows 8. The laptop works fine but whenever windows tries to update it freezes, can't finish the update, restarts 3-4 times before undoing the installation.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "happy with computer", "Author": "chunter131", "ReviewID": "R28SFHYJ6UHI1M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer arrived very soon after ordering, well packaged and all items as advertised.  The computer is in like new condition.  No scratches, no anything that was not as it is supposed to be .  Very happy with the purchase. Windows 8 was a challenge (having replaced windows xp) but I am learning.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Windows 8", "Author": "Charles McLean", "ReviewID": "R1T6886UYAYLKV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far the Windows 8 takes some getting use too.  Don't have all the access too everything like Window's 7.  You have to download apps for things that should already be on the computer.  But it does seem to be faster on the start up.  All in all I would rate it a 7 on a 1-10 scale.", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is AMAZING!!!", "Author": "Amy Schuster", "ReviewID": "R2OCTP1D8VTECX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this laptop.
