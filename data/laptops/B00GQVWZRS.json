Microsoft royally screwed things with Windows 8, so having the option for Windows 7 is great. Also I can dual boot Linux Operating System in this. It is easy to upgrade as far as upgrading the RAM and Hard Drive. It also comes with a DVD Burning drive. It is AMD A-8 Quad Core. Boots up fast. Apple Macbook Pro eat your heart out. This feels like a Macbook Pro except I can do more and have more flexibility. Get this while you still can with Windows 7. $999 can't beat the price with 8GB of Ram and a Samsung SSD.", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mine was a lemon", "Author": "Donald E. Kuhn", "ReviewID": "RWHLRCW1XULCL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1.  Battery would not hold a charge2.  Windows would not boot on the battery3.  On AC I tried a restart.  The screen went blank and the computer would not automatically restart.4.  Every time  I tried to boot up on the battery I got a Windows error recovery screen; one continuous loop over and over again5.  Took the computer to a computer service store at which I have had excellent service in the past.  They diagnosed the computer and found, \"The brand new computer does not run properly on the battery alone.  When adjusting some power settings, the laptop does stay on while not plugged in but the wireless adaptor shut itself off\"They did not open up the computer since it was still under the 30 day return policy.  They recommended that I return it since they felt there was a major problem with the motherboard and I would continue to have problems with it.Needless to say I was very disappointed in and dissatisfied with this computer and returned it.  I did get a full refund.I have since resurected my older laptop and will continue to make do with it.I have always had good experiences with HP products in the past.  I think this one was just a lemon.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop computer", "Author": "Thomas W.

It took almost 5 minutes for it to recognize and install a drive for a wireless mouse! Same thing when I inserted an SD card to retrieve pictures. There is very little on this machine so I don't know why its so slow. But everything else about it is great. Comfy keyboard, good display. I found it in TigerDirect for 40% off the price and no, its not a refurb.", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GQVWZRS"}}
