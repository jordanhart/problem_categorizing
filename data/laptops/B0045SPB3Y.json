Charron", "ReviewID": "R6T87D9GN0BFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this laptop at a big-box store (price was lower) - and I love it.  It's a replacement for my 3-year old desktop, and I couldn't be happier.  I run a lot of photo-editing software so I needed a system that could handle multiple large programs at once and this laptop doesn't flinch - everything is smooth and seamless, the display is beautiful and the 10-digit keypad is a nice touch.  The battery life is solid at 3.5 hours, too.  No complaints!", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great so far!", "Author": "Sparkfly88 \"Kyle\"", "ReviewID": "RB7XVNJ62378V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from best-buy yesterday evening to replace my antique desktop.So far it's done everything I wanted it to do.Windows 7 pro sure is sleek to compared windows xp home. Plus having a processor bigger than 933mhz is amazing :DNo cons yet!", "Date": "October 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Definite pro's and con's", "Author": "Jason G.", "ReviewID": "R1PYEPLVGPJYCK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My wife bought this for me at Christmas and I definitely have opinions on it. Experience level: Geeky =]The screen is beautiful, and movies and such look great.Performance was surprisingly slower than I would expect a 4 core processor to be, but it is running Win 7. It's possible some more RAM may help, or putting Win7 on a diet (preferred) would be in order.Love the half a terabyte!As I commented in another review, getting used to the offset keyboard and mouse took 5 weeks or so, but it's worth it. I assume they put the keypad in to fill the lower portion of the laptop. I do like the keypad, it's handy!The worst thing they did was the mouse pad. It is a capacitive type that allows for pinching which I turned off a few days into it. Unfortunately it also makes the mouse movement erratic during normal use, and when the cover is closed and it's left on, the mouse does it's own thing. When I return I find many windows have been opened- sometimes 20+, and it's dinging at me because Windows wants input and the mouse is still possessed. FAIL. Especially when you have it next to the bed.", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "don't like off-center touch pad", "Author": "HK \"heatherks\"", "ReviewID": "R33159NWAIHP7J", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm a skilled touch-typist and long-time laptop user.  Bought this one a few days ago from a big-box store (lower price).  Fingers kept hitting the wrong keys.  Couldn't figure out why, until I realized I needed to move the laptop about 4\" to the right, so that my head is in centered on the touchpad, not the center of the screen.  I don't like this design.", "Date": "October 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "VPCEB36GM BSOD New HDrive New Memory", "Author": "Mark Twain \"Einstein\"", "ReviewID": "R11B70LR6ZGKRR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had an opportunity to use this laptop or attempted to.  I was tasked with removing a suspected virus from this laptop which was thought to be causing BSOD on startup.  Placed hard drive in another PC to scan for viruses.  None found.  Ran complete system recovery to return system back to factory default condition.  System recovery ran to 100% and upon restart would BSOD before even making it into windows 7 pro.  Replaced memory and hard drive with new.  Ordered recovery CD's from manufacturer.  Thought this has to work.  Same results.  I would not buy this laptop.  Even with new memory, new hard drive and factory recovery CD's this system would not startup even on factory recovery completing to 100%.  The only thing left is to send unit to Sony.  This laptop either has poorly engineered cooling properties or is not truely x64 capable.  I would avoid this laptop.  Valueable advice...anytime you get a NEW laptop.  Make your recovery CD's immediately and then run a complete system recovery to ensure the integrity of your new purchase.  If a NEW laptop cannot function after running complete system recovery, it is not worth keeping.", "Date": "February 27, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0045SPB3Y"}}
