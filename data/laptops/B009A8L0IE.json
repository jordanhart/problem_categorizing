{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Long and dark, shiny and black", "Author": "Jon Folkers", "ReviewID": "R2AD9DK6AZYR56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"Long and dark, shiny and black ... open up your engines, let `em roar, tearin' up the highway like a big old dinosaur!\" said Springsteen about Cadillac Ranch, and the same could be said of this four hundred dollar laptop from Acer. I got it as a desktop replacement to run Windows 8 as well as indie PC games, and I think it's going to work out fine.It's a big, heavy, shiny black plastic thing, portable but not light. Hinges and latch move well. The screen is bright and sharp, with adequate but not great viewing angles. I wouldn't mind watching a movie on this screen, but it would be difficult to share it with someone else given these viewing angles. I suppose you could consider this a privacy feature. The chiclet style keyboard has full size keys with good tactile feedback and an intelligent layout. The full-size number keys are particularly welcome. I wish it were backlit but that's something for a higher-end machine. Functions such as media playback, volume control, and brightness control require two hands -- one to press the function key on the left side, and another to press the desired action. Not optimal but fair enough considering the price.There's a webcam with microphone and a \"Dolby Home Theater\" speaker grille up front, both of which work as expected. The large trackpad is off center with the screen but lines up nicely with the keyboard, and is responsive to touch. The trackpad buttons are easy to hit with your thumbs. Up front is an SD card slot, which SHOT THE COVER ACROSS THE ROOM when I tapped it to eject it. Be careful with your photos when loading them onto this machine!Ports on the left side of the machine: Power (where it should be, near the recessed power button), gigabit ethernet, a large exhaust vent, a full size VGA port, HDMI out, USB 3.0, microphone, and headphone jacks. Ports on the right side: Kensington security slot (I wonder about its usefulness given the plasticy feel of the machine), a pop-out DVD tray, and two USB 2.0 slots, unfortunately right where a right-handed person would want to use a plug-in mouse.Wifi-N is superfast, the 500GB hard drive speed is a bit pokey but acceptable, system boot speed is quick, and graphics performance is wonderful for the price. A8 Vision from AMD is considered the budget gamer card of choice, and it does not disappoint. I threw every 3D game from my Steam collection at it, and the only title that required me to turn down the graphical detail was Star Wars: The Old Republic, and then only down halfway while running at full resolution.The system ships with Windows 8, which is a mixed bag -- check the reviews elsewhere for that. It's as schizophrenic as they say, but it's probably going to get better with software updates. The Acer suite of pre-installed software is innocuous and easy to remove.Verdict? If you want an inexpensive laptop that can play games and run Windows 8, this is certainly worth a look.UPDATE: I've added some new hardware to this machine. It's no longer a four hundred dollar laptop, but know this: the machine can take 16GB of 1600MHz DDR3 RAM (despite the manufacturer saying it maxes out at 8GB), which bumps the Windows memory rating up to 7. Add a solid state hard drive and the storage i/o rating goes up to 8. Both upgrades, especially the SSD, really make this machine /sing/.UPDATE #2: The Wifi driver is inexplicably set to power down by default, which explains the unreliability some people have reported. Solving this problem requires you to simply uncheck the box in the wireless network interface Properties pane.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "A $600+ laptop for $400", "Author": "Srath", "ReviewID": "R1KXKKOPOXTVWZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've spent a few days with this laptop and I absolutely love it. Though it has shortcomings, the outstanding price/performance far outweighs them. I could throw a slew of benchmarks at you that I've done on this laptop, however, that would do little to represent real world performance. I'll try and keep this as short as I can.Right off the bat I should say that I upgraded to 8 GB of RAM. There are two RAM slots and you can throw up to two 8gb SODIMMs in this thing for a total of 16gb if you'd like. Although, I would recommend just 8gb. If you want to optimize your graphics performance (which uses the system RAM) spend a little extra and get memory clocked at 1600mhz. I always recommend G.Skill memory products and after installing 8gb of it into this laptop, (for gaming) I jumped an entire preset up in most games, sometimes two presets. I mention this right away because I want to make it clear that upgrading the RAM in this machine will make it shine.The included HDD is 5400rpm. It's passable, but will slow down loading for larger programs where a lot of data is involved like Photoshop, video editing software, and games. I wouldn't necessarily recommend an upgrade to an SSD unless you want to put up the cash for a high capacity drive. I'd stay away from 7200 rpm HDDs unless you want to cut your battery by 20% or if battery capacity isn't important to you.Speaking of battery life, It's alright. It's average for it's class, getting around 4 hours on a full charge - more if you conserve with no audio, video, or heavy use. Less if you are doing any gaming while not plugged in. Keep screen brightness down for best results.The keyboard is fine. It's comfortable to type on and the trackpad is well positioned and sized. My only gripe with input devices is the keyboard not being backlit. The numberpad is a nice touch also.The screen, while average resolution, is pretty nice. Color reproduction isn't very good (for all you artists), however text is very readable and the display generally looks great in most lighting conditions. The viewing angles are just okay, but some may consider that a positive for privacy.The speakers are above average for laptops in this class, however nothing amazing. The sound is clear and gets fairly loud. However, as is a problem with most laptops, bass is almost non-existent.Enough ports to get the job done, and USB 3.0 is a nice touch, albeit a little anemic at a single port.Windows 8 is okay. I'm sure that it will only get better with time, but I've encountered many bugs with the OS so far that have almost made me switch to 7. After getting them fixed though, I'm pleased with how the OS works. The learning curve can be steep if you're used to 7 and not prone to picking things up quickly. Microsoft took 8 out of the oven before it was done, but it's really close to being a great operating system.A quick note on upgrading. Everything is easily accessible via a removable hatch under the unit towards the front. Good call, Acer.The processor, while not as powerful per core as a lowly Sandy Bridge Core i3, is actually quite speedy with four cores and \"turbo core\". I've had no bottlenecks with everyday use and gaming. The only situation where the AMD silicon has let me down is multimedia editing. Photo and video editing is clearly this CPUs shortcoming. While not terrible, the i3 outclasses it by at least 10% under full load. The Intel architecture is simply better and more efficient. Don't let this hold you back from purchasing this if you're on the cusp however. I, myself, am a photographer and use have used this in the field on numerous occasions to great effect.As I said right off the bat, the graphics performance can be greatly improved with an upgrade to the RAM, as the integrated solution uses the onboard RAM as VRAM. For you gamers on a budget, this is a great buy! But, you should manage your expectations. This is a laptop. The hardware is specifically designed to work with a 1366x786 res screen. If you plan on hooking this up to a 1080p display, remember you might need to back off on the post processing a bit. While I don't have specific benchmarks as I couldn't get my license of FRAPS to play nice with Windows 8, here are a few games and basic presets this machine is capable of with the specified RAM upgrade: Fallout 3 - High (Barely Playable on Ultra) , SW:TOR - Medium , Skyrim - High , Borderlands 2 - Medium , Saint Row/Third - High , Portal 2 - MAX.I hope this review was helpful. I highly recommend this laptop for almost anyone. With or without a few hardware upgrades, it is worth every bit of the price tag and more.", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Wife's Favorite Early XMAS Present", "Author": "E.

This little rig runs great, is more than capable of casual gaming, holds a charge and is very easy to get used to.  Windows 8 is still a bit frustrating, but we're getting there.  Got the Logitech T650 with it, and the two work together perfectly.  Learning gestures is something completely new, and is much harder for me than my 9 y/o son who this laptop was bought for.  He had limited exposure to Win7, so is taking to Win8 like a duck to water, and once you get over the appearance differences, there is a familiar interface underneath, so I can make adjustments and set some things up for him.  The smaller working area of the touchpad is a benefit to his small hands, but often makes my old hands feel like clumsy hams on ropes, and using Win7 since beta, every day, on many different PCs significantly steepened my learning curve for 8.  I'll keep Win7 on my workhorse rigs, but for younger, more permeable minds, Win8 really is very slick and works in a fairly obvious fashion.The laptop itself is very functional, looks great (but is a fingerprint magnet), and so far has no heat issues.  Everything works as it should, software installs and uninstalls without a hitch, and there doesn't appear to be an overabundance of bloatware pre-installed.  The first couple of hours, as usual, were uninstalling all the \"free\" junk, setting up his user account, syncing with apps I already had from G Play and Amazon that were compatible, getting a good AV, virtual disk and network/file explorer installed, a media suite (we have a media server for all the household devices and as it has to be cross-platform, no PC will natively be able to play the files), set up his email and online accounts, and he was off to the races.It is all plastic, so time will tell if will hold up, but at this price point, we're not expecting a tank.  Have not found any \"quirks\" like a few of our other laptops have had (Toshiba in particular), and so far, it is reasonably fast, runs like a little top, and is remarkably unremarkable in that it just does what you want it to do without any quibbling.  I don't know what else one could ask for without spending a LOT more.  Retina? No.  Server?  No.  Tournament FPS gaming rig?  Not quite.  But for a student/gamer/netizen/app junky on a budget?

All my friends were against this company because for some reason their Acer laptops did not work properly. It was also the first computer with AMD processor I was getting. What I'm going to say? I love it so far. I added extra 4 gigs of RAM because I work with music on this little guy.It is stylish (but attracts dust and fingerprints), not so heavy (for 15-inch), and big enough. The touch pad is comfortable (after using Dell and Sony laptops); it is like Lenovo's.I'm giving four stars because of the graphic card. I work with Photoshop CS6, and the picture goes black when you select it sometimes. It is a pretty common problem for Radeon cards, as I found out, but it can be fixed, if you switch to lighter settings. Saying more, these lighter settings work for me much better than the fancy ones (I could not get used to them).Windows 8 is fun to play with. Not a bad system, but I mostly spend my time on desktop without using apps.So, if you are still thinking about purchasing, I would say do so. AMD is not a bad processor; it is four-core and works pretty fast; however, I would recommend paying $50-60 more and getting some extra RAM for this guy because it can make your life even better!_____Update 1/16/2013So, one week before the warranty supposed to be expired, a charging part got broken. I immediately contacted Acer, and they said they will fix this issue. I mailed the laptop while I was out of the country, and expected it to be fixed by the time I will come back. Nothing was fixed whatsoever! The issue stayed, and now the laptop does not even charge! So, I waisted money for shipping for nothing!AVOID THIS BRAND AS HELL!!! NEVER BUY ANYTHING FROM ACER!!!

Performance vs Price was amazing. However, with 268 days left in warranty.(about 90 days of ownership so far) Many of the keys are flaky at best and feel like they could break off at any moment. I BABY this thing no drops, no hard typing, nothing. The touchpad has issues and is nearly unusable. I always use a mouse so I wrote it off as a quirk. Well, now the laptop just shuts off, like the battery and cord have just been ripped out. It sometimes happens during first boot, sometimes while checking email.I thought I just got a defective laptop and it's understandable, production line problems happen. I am on a tight budget though and to get the broken laptop I was sold fixed I have to pay shipping myself. So after you add on the $50 of shipping and packaging required by Acer(5 inches of bubble wrap on both sides), oh and you are responsible if shipping damages occur as well so make sure you have enough insurance to cover it, you could have upgraded to a better laptop than this one, or at least \"sidegraded\" to company with better support. Oh and since it's most likely a motherboard problem, I imagine I will be receiving a refurbished laptop or at least the important parts of one. So now we throw in the fact that I have now paid around $500 for a \"used\" laptop, because there is no telling how old the replacement is or where it came from. I am OCD and that bother the hell out of me. I say stay the hell away and try ASUS, MSi, or Gigabyte. HP/Compaq laptops I own are worse off than this one. I will stick to custom building my desktops and deal without portability from now on.They also tell you to pack it in the same quality as when they ship them out to insure a damage free ride, but if you tell them you are putting it back into it's retail box you received it in and shipping it in their own Styrofoam and packaging they are quick to tell you no and that it needs a minimum of 3-5 inches of bubble wrap on all sides.

I can run some of the more graphics-intensive games with ease, such as Skyrim, The Witcher 2, and Assassin's Creed 3. Overall, I'm completely satisfied with my purchase.

Great for college!", "Author": "Shayna Pulley \"Shayn\"", "ReviewID": "R3FW1LAQ200Z7V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since receiving this computer as a \"back to school\" gift 3 months ago, I have been pleasantly surprised.  Initially I was very frustrated with Windows 8 and didn't really start using this laptop until the update for Windows 8.1 became available.  Now I'm using my laptop all of the time!  The hardware on this computer is excellent, and it's inexpensive to upgrade.  The HDD doesn't make much noise, the fan is silent, the machine runs very cool, and for 5.5 lbs I really don't notice the weight at all.  Personally I will be adding more RAM (to be a total of 8 GB) because I'm notorious for having thirty tabs open, plus Skype, plus a movie, plus Facebook and a word processor- all at the same time.The keyboard is amazing with only one caveat: you must use the Fn key to control brightness, volume, mute, and to toggle a few other features.  There is no way to make the Fn key \"sticky\" (without changing BIOS settings), so this means that if you are an amputee or disabled, you cannot control the volume and brightness with one hand.  You'll have to go into the control panel settings and adjust the settings from there.  Several of the other Fn key applications are easily accessible through Windows 8 via the charms bar, so that's a non-issue.  For volume you'll have to use the desktop taskbar to adjust levels, and for brightness you must go through control panel or power settings.The touchpad is a little finicky at first, adjust the settings until you can be comfortable with it.  It's very plastic and the buttons don't give a satisfying \"click\".  I got over it.  I struggled initially to get the two-finger scrolling to work the way I wanted it to (I don't prefer \"reversed\").  It took me a few days to get to know its quirks and adjust accordingly.  One big nuisance you'll find about Windows 8 is the \"edge swipe\" function of the touch pad.  This drove me bonkers and I disabled it as soon as possible.  I've since re-enabled it.  It grows on you eventually.  Now my touchpad and I are good friends.Windows 8.1 is still an adjustment from all other Windows operating systems that you may be comfortable with.  It runs beautifully on this Aspire V3 and it wakes from sleep in under a minute most of the time.  If you're a first time Win8 user, I encourage you to ignore but not get rid of the \"metro/Start Screen\" feature.  Eventually you'll tip toe your way into that feature and find it pleasurable for media purposes like Netflix, Facebook (finally!), Skype, and internet radio.  I like having those things separate from my desktop so that I can focus on more school-related tasks.Windows 8 does NOT come with any version of Microsoft Office/Word/Excel/PowerPoint.  You cannot open these documents unless you download/purchase a program to do this.  Very frustrating at first, but I've since coped with free third party applications.Additionally, Windows 8 does NOT come with any way to play a DVD.  There is a DVD player/writer built into this computer, but Windows 8 does not provide any sort of program to play DVDs. Acer was amazing and included pre-installed software on this PC to allow DVD playback, for free.  The program is called Acer Media (also known as \"clear.fi\") and it plays DVDs like a charm.  Just set your region the first time you load the program and it's ready for you.I don't like the plastic body of this computer.  It makes me very nervous because it seems very vulnerable not only to fingerprints and scratches, but maybe even breaking.  I'm very careful to keep my computer protected whenever it's not sitting on my desk.  I'm used to the older laptops that were made with very hefty plastic that could take a real beating and show no fear.I might add more to this review later!-Update 12/27/2013 I just installed an extra 4 gb of RAM yesterday totaling 8 gb of memory.  My computer doesn't get hung up/freeze as easily when I perform large tasks. Before doing this yourself I recommend watching a video on YouTube of someone opening up their own Acer Aspire v3 551 laptop.  I was helpful to see how much force someone else uses to open and re-close the hatches (it requires a lot of force).  Watch carefully how they put the DDR3 RAM chip into the metal clip- it should be inserted at a diagonal and then pressed down in the holding clamps.  There were no included instructions with the computer on how to perform this upgrade effectively.-Update 12/20/2013 I just factory reset my PC.  The onboard Acer Recovery Management software made it a long but painless and easy experience, I highly recommend it.  Unfortunately, you'll have to install all of the Windows 8 updates before being able to re-install Windows 8.1 for free from the \"store\".  That was even longer than factory resetting the PC.  BUT IT WAS WORTH IT!  Why?  Because I had tried downloading new sound drivers from the Acer website specifically for this PC and it caused a LOT of problems.  The pre-installed Dolby Home Theater software disappeared and my computer made awful loud screeching and beeping noises when pressing certain buttons or at random intervals.  I recommend not updating the drivers on this computer unless you've experienced a problem with your hardware.  Don't fix what ain't broke!!!!!!

Overall, in one capacity or another I've bought five Acer laptops and desktops alone, second only to Apple products (which I started using in 2005 and never stopped).I say that to premise my experience with my purchase of this, particular Acer because, based on my prior experiences, I think I was incredibly unlucky to get a dud with this computer and therefore would not hesitate to buy another Acer. I would not, however, buy this particular laptop.I was shocked when I was actually talking to a friend on Skype who, suffice to say, is an \"IT person\" (it would, in reality, be an insult to call him that), the computer was on standby as we were discussing some configuration options, when there suddenly appeared a message on the screen indicating that the computer was shutting down because it was too hot. When I attempted to restart the computer, it was dead as a door nail (indicative of the motherboard going out, according to my \"IT person\" who saw what happened and said he had never seen something like that happen in 30 years (hence my conclusion that my experience with this particular laptop is not indicative of Acer's products)).Unfortunately, I bought the computer when I was in a crunch and therefore was not able to deal with trying to return a computer to Amazon (rather than a \"brick and mortar\" store) within the 30 days. I have not yet to be able trying to navigate the warranty replacement under Acer and have no idea whether that will be \"quick and painless\" or whether it will be like dealing with Dell 10 years ago (which was an absolute nightmare curing me of ever being tempted to buy another Dell). As it is now, it's just another problem to deal with for which I have not had time.That being said, as far as the actual computer goes, I liked it; however--and bear in mind that I used the computer for less than 20 hours and never even had it fully configured, in hindsight I think the Acer Aspire One AO756 that is currently being sold by Amazon for $299 is the best value for money spent. The Aspire One has 8 gigs of memory, dual cores (which is all you need if you won't be running any virtual machines on it, as I was planning to do), Intel, and a 320 or 500 gig hard drive. I forget the speed on the AO756, but whatever it is, I did not notice a difference in performance between the AO756 and this laptop. The most obvious difference between the two is that the AO756 has an 11.6 inch screen, which is preferable to me anyway because if I'm using the laptop's screen as my main screen rather than having it displaying on a monitor, then under almost any circumstances 15 inches is just to bulky and cumbersome.Theses are two different computers and, looking at the specs, the AO756 might not seem comparable, but I think most people would not detect an appreciable difference. I purchased this laptop because I wanted to run a virtual machine on it and therefore needed the extra power, but I don't think most people do that (I would have no idea how or why I would want to do that absent my friend's suggestion).I hope this helps someone who might be on the fence trying to figure out the differences between the various models and price points.Cheers!Melisa L.

My first quick impression was instant dislike for fit and feel, the screen seems to torque in an uncomfortable way when you pry it open, if you have owned better you will understand, the keyboard is one of the worse I have ever used, the touch pad and clickers are even worse than the keyboard itself somehow made to confuse the user and make you hunt down the buttons in the bland black darkness, if this wasn't bad enough the pad is placed to the left side of the keyboard, better for a left handed person maybe but forces a right handed person to cross the center of the keyboard to control slinding motion. The touch pad starts in the center and goes left from there about three inches pretty dumb in my opinion. They went against the proven idea of giving you some kind of groove to hold on to while opening the system from closed position, and without something to grip when opening you almost always end up having the sytem slide out of its placement to get it open.

Acer also has intel based drivers listed on a AMD machine?  No thanks to Acer this machine is working, I could not live with the touch pad so I bought a USB mouse I think the machine is better for the improvements. Acer forces you to give them the 22 charactor SN for every question you submit to them and responds only fifty percent of the time.

It came nicely packaged in a small box which contained only the bare essentials - the laptop, the charger, and an instructional diagram. Getting the laptop up and running was a piece of cake. The laptop itself is made of plastic. Despite this, it does not feel cheap or poorly constructed. The plastic backing is shiny and has a \"premium look\". The keyboard and speakers are also arranged in an aesthetically pleasing manner.The laptop comes with the regular edition of Windows 8. It comes pre-installed with quite a bit of \"bloatware\" from Acer, i.e., programs that they likely get paid to include on the machine. This includes McAfee antivirus, Norton backup software, Acer music and video software, a video editing suite, and numerous other Acer programs. I spent about an hour and a half deleting all of this software using the \"Add and remove programs\" feature in the control panel. Luckily, they uninstalled painlessly and left no discernible traces behind them. I also deleted the included links to eBay, Amazon, and Netflix, and deleted all of the pre-installed Acer \"apps\" found on the Windows 8 \"Metro\" interface. The only Acer apps that I left behind were \"Launch Manager\" (for the hot keys) and \"Identity Card\" (which displays your laptop's serial number). This left the system with a clean look and zippy feel.I then proceeded to install the new student edition of Microsoft Office, Google Chrome, and Google Drive (the latter of which I used to download all of my personal files from my other computer). If you do install Office, make sure you open Word, Excel, and PowerPoint individually to uninstall the included AcerCloud add-in. This may be done by going to options, add-ins, and then manage COM add-ins. Remove them to speed up start up time. Now the laptop is looking good and working well. I fired up a few videos on Youtube to test the speakers and they actually get loud and produce pretty good sound quality. The screen resolution and overall video quality is also good for the price. Battery life so far seems to be about three hours (the description on the website says five), which is enough for me.I \"upgraded\" to this system from a two-year-old HP Pavilion dv6t running an Intel Pentium i7 processor with 8 gigabytes of RAM. So in a sense this was a \"downgrade\", but actually, the responsiveness of the system is about equivalent to that of my more expensive HP. Also, this computer is lighter, has better battery life, and doesn't make nearly as much noise or get as hot. So it was a worthwhile trade off. I chose an Acer this time around because I used to own one (back in 2006) and it served me well and never broke down. Hopefully this one will live up to its predecessor. I have had several HP laptops break down on me and wasted a lot of time on the line with their tech support and didn't want to live through that again.I should point out to potential buyers, there is another machine on Amazon right now by Asus that looks to be identical to this Acer. However, it's a bit cheaper. If I had realized this when I made the purchase I probably would have tried it instead. It is the ASUS K55N-DS81 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black) currently available for $379.99. If my opinion of this Acer laptop changes I'll update my review in the future.8/13/2013 - I've now been using the laptop for about three months. I haven't had any problems with it so far. It still feels very responsive for browsing the internet, watching videos online, and document editing. I also use it quite a bit for statistical analysis using the R programming language and have been happy with its responsiveness. Battery life is as advertised when using power saver mode.", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "BOUGHT BASICALLY INTERNET USE", "Author": "Tri", "ReviewID": "RL0WPR86LIWG7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My first one could not hold an internet connection.

There is a GOOD reason for that. I currently own Aspire 5742-6811, and my personal experience with Aspire is terrible. Your laptop will likely hold just fine for roughly 6 months, but it goes downhill from there.1. Common overheating problem- if you regularly use any programs that is at least moderately demanding, I suggest backing off of Acer, especially the Aspire model. The internal fan might as well not exist. If you must buy this laptop, it's imperative that you buy a TOP END fan. I suggest Coolmaster.2. Deteriorating Performance- as time goes on, your laptop will naturally decline in performance due to all the junk we put in there, but Aspires respond especially badly to age. Within a year, you can expect your laptop to significantly slow down after using a moderately demanding program for at least 5 minutes.3. Cheap sound system- most Acers, including the Aspire line, have terrible sound quality. If you have and will always use a headset, this one does not apply to you. For anyone who ever plans to use the laptop's speakers, be warned: the laptop's max volume is a fraction of its competitors at similar price ranges. Competitors have adopted more advanced sound systems that will allow you to hear sound well from about 10 feet away, but not Acer. Max volume will be comparable to a volume setting of 7 in the average vehicle.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worked right up to warranty...", "Author": "Diane Harris \"Dharris\"", "ReviewID": "R2PALM74IM6NYB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My monitor went out just before the warranty expired.
