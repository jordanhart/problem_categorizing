I needed a light weight, system with Toshiba's excellent keyboard. I needed a laptop I could replace the O/S with our company image without needing to spend hours searching for proprietary drivers. I was not disappointed, All the drivers to create where found on Toshiba's website with a easy to navigate menu. I over-wrote the Toshiba image which came on this system.All the features worked. The boot time is around an incredible 10 seconds to the login screen. Everyone I have shown the laptop to are impressed with the light weight, fast boot time, excellent keyboard and display.While this is not yet my \"daily driver\", it gives me the great service that my other Toshiba laptops have given me.An excellent product.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "light, good specs, but flimsy and unreliable", "Author": "I.
