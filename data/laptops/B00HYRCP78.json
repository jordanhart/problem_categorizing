{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good multimedia laptop for someone who needs a lot of storage.", "Author": "Deron Baker \"angry music fan\"", "ReviewID": "R2HKWSOTRH2S4F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is a modified version of the stock HP Envy TouchSmart 17 inch laptop series.  Eluktronics obtains the base model from Hewlett Packard and replaces the hard drives with larger capacity ones.  I actually went to the HP online store and attempted to custom build a laptop similar to this.  I was close, but HP\u2019s site only offered a max of 2 TB total storage.  This model from Eluktronics turned out to be a better deal, especially considering the touchscreen and SSD (Solid State Drive), both which can be pricey by themselves.Let me start with a quick summary and then elaborate.  It\u2019s a great laptop for high def videos, a good laptop for music, an okay laptop for gaming, but a poor choice for simple school work.  In essence, this laptop is designed for someone who needs a lot of space to watch high definition video or edit video, in a semi-portable format.  This laptop could also prove useful for music recording or editing, especially if you needed space to store \u201clossless\u201d music.  This is primarily a multi-media laptop, not a top-tiered gaming laptop.  Gaming is possible, but only in medium graphic settings for modern games.  It\u2019s also an overkill if you only need to do school work or documents/spreadsheets.  (Note that Eluktronics offers less expensive variations of this laptop with less storage space which may suit your needs.)The defining feature of this laptop is storage space.  You cannot find this amount of storage from any pre-fabricated, store-bought laptop.  The two, non-primary hard drives are 2 TB each (not linked by RAID) which provide more than adequate space to store hours and hours of video.  (Uncompressed, full 1080p video is approximately 13 GB for 1 hour of footage, just to give you an idea.)  On the first night I transferred about 1700 files of movies and TV shows (of various resolutions) to one of the hard drives.A second feature that distinguishes this from a standard, store-bought HP laptop is the addition of an SSD.  The 256 GB SSD is the primary hard drive, the C: drive.  Eluktronics installs Windows 8.1 directly to this.  (Windows is not installed on another drive and then \u201cmirrored\u201d to the SSD.)  This is the best place to install program files, too.  The read and write speeds of this drive are much faster than a spinning hard drive, thus allowing the laptop to boot up in about 8 or 9 seconds, and reboots in about 15 seconds.  Programs also install and launch faster.  I've only had the laptop a week and am already convinced that I need an SSD in every computer I buy from this point out.The included NVIDIA GeForce 740M graphics card is middle of the road, good enough for most HD video editing needs and can easily handle 1080p video playback.  I was able to jump forward and backwards through the movies with almost no stutter.  With the included Blu Ray player you have everything you need to import movies, convert to other video formats, edit, store, and watch videos to your heart\u2019s content.This is my first touchscreen laptop and I will never go back to non-touchscreen.  It makes navigating everything faster.  Also, trying to use Windows 8.1 with only a mouse or touchpad is tedious.  You are almost forced to have a touchscreen with Windows 8.1.The other components of this laptop work as advertised.  The Beats Audio speakers and subwoofer (on the bottom of the body) provide a good, but not great, audio experience.  I\u2019ve heard better on the Toshiba Qosmio series, but that series lacks the touchscreen monitor.  The Bluetooth radio works well, and I find that pairing it with a Jambox is the best audio option anyway.  The dual band WiFi radio is really good.  I am getting download speeds about 25% faster than with my previous laptop.  The keyboard and touchpad are good but not great.  Backlighting on the keyboard is well done.  They keys are spacious and the full number pad to the right is always nice.  However, as with all the HP Envy 17 inch laptops, the keyboard on mine is a little weak and flexible on the left side.  It is more a cosmetic thing because it doesn\u2019t affect typing speed.  But you\u2019ll see it if you tap any key left of \u201cg\u201d.  Part of the keypad will sink down into the body about a millimeter or two.  Also, the touchpad buttons takes a bit getting used to.  They are hidden below the pad itself and are activated by clicking the bottom of the pad.  The left button is harder to click and you\u2019ll need to learn where to press to do it best.  Granted, some of this can be alleviated.  There is an option to tap once on the touchpad itself which will perform the same action as clicking the left button.  Also, you can touch the screen to substitute a lot of the left button actions, which is faster anyway.  But clicking and holding the left button to select multiple items does take more effort.  Not a deal breaker, just annoying.One little thing to note is that the air vent on the HP Envy series is on the left side, which is the best place to have it.  Some laptops have the vents on the back, adjacent to where the monitor attaches.  This is bad because this area is often blocked by legs or anything you set your laptop on.  Not to mention, it blows hot air onto your legs when on a lap.  Other laptops put their vent on the right side, right next to where most people would use a mouse, blowing hot air on their right wrist.  HP got it right with the air vent.I used the term \u201csemi-portable\u201d in an earlier paragraph because I want to highlight its portability limitations.  Most 17 inch laptops are really considered a \u201cdesktop replacement\u201d, meaning that is has the power of a desktop but you can take it from room to room in your house.  It\u2019s bulk and weight prohibit it from being something to port with you everyday to class.  And due to the larger hard drives and SSD, this laptop is considerably heavier than other 17 inch HP laptops.  My friend\u2019s 17 inch HP Pavilion laptop is several pounds lighter, despite it being thicker.  To be blunt, this thing is a lead tank.  Also, the battery has only 6 cells, completely flush with the bottom.  So you will average between 2.5 to 5 hours of battery life, depending on what you are doing.  (However, Eluktronics provides a second battery and the laptop can be shut down and rebooted quickly.)A couple of tips if you do buy this laptop or any of the other variants that Eluktronics sells.  1)  Use the Beats Audio Settings to adjust your sound levels (equalizer, bass, treble, etc.) and turn off specific, in-app audio settings.  This menu can be accessed via the little Beats icon that shows up in the lower right of your screen.  When I first played music, I thought something was wrong. I said to myself, \u201cEither I have a blown speaker, or Dr. Dre is full of crap, because this sounds awful.\u201d  I then realized that the computer was filtering the music through both iTunes and Beats Audio equalizers.  I turned off the iTunes equalizer and the music immediately sounded better.  2)  TURN DOWN THE VOLUME to 15 or less BEFORE you plug in headphones.  Holy mother of God, I almost blew an eardrum the first time I plugged in headphones.  Volume levels do not correlate well between speakers and headphones.  3)  Turn off your HP updates in the HP Support Assistant program.  In Amazon\u2019s feedback for Eluktronics, many customers reported serious problems using the HP Support Assistant to update their laptops.  Luckily, Eluktronics was able to help them revive their laptops.  However, all the problems seem to stem from an incompatibility between the HP Support Assistant and the Solid State Drive.  It\u2019s almost as if this program is not expecting an SSD (because these laptops came from HP with no SSD, it was added later) and it crashes the system when an update is attempted.  So, in the program look in settings for the line \u201cHow would you like to receive software updates and messages from HP\u201d and choose the option:  \u201cNever check for updates or messages (not recommended)\u201d.  You can update your computer via the regular Windows update found in the Control Panel.  App-specific updates can be done in the app itself.  You don\u2019t need a third party software doing updates for you.  I had an old HP laptop for 3 years, disabled the HP Support Assistant, and never had a problem updating my laptop from the Windows Control Panel.Lastly, let me say how impressed I was with the customer service from Eluktronics.  I was hesitant to spend over 2 grand on a laptop online from an anonymous vendor.  But I emailed a list of questions and their representative responded within a few hours, answering all my questions.  As per my request, the IT department performed Windows updates on my laptop (no extra charge) before shipping.  This way I was ensured that the Windows updates would be compatible with the SSD.  They also provided feedback after I received the laptop.  If you have a specific need or something you want customized, just email them to see if they can provide that for you.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,799.99", "Features": "2.4GHz/3.4GHz Quad Core Intel Core i7-4700MQ CPU, Genuine Windows 8.1 64-Bit\n17.3 inch Ten Point Touch Screen LED-backlit display, 1920-by-1080p resolution\n4.25TB's Storage via 2 x 2TB Hard Drives & a 256GB Primary SSD Performance Drive\n2GB (2048MB) NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M Dedicated Graphics, 16GB DDR3L 1600MHz RAM\nFull Size Backlit Keyboard, Beats Audio, 2 x 6 Cell Batteries, Intel WiFi-N 2x2 Dual Band AC, 2 Year Warranty", "Name": "HP ENVY TouchSmart 17t-j100 Fully Loaded Core i7-4700MQ Quad Edition Multimedia Notebook PC (EXTREME PERFORMANCE & MASSIVE 4.25TB STORAGE, 16GB RAM)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FtJhrEwEL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HYRCP78"}}
