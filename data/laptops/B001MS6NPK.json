The tech was supposed to call us and when he finally did he said he found other things wrong with it...like the mouse thing. What???Then they accuse me of breaking it on purpose and stuff. Who in their right mind would do that? They said they even called and got a \"confirmation\" that thats what happened? HELLLLOOO? WHAT? Who would they call?

Not fantastic, but I didn't have any major problems with it. Then the fan started to make a ridiculously loud noise. I go online, find out it's a known issue, called Sony, and had them come fix it for free. No problem. Then the screen starts flickering and showing horizontal lines across the bottom, which gradually gets worse until the screen is basically unusable. I go online, and find out that this is also a known issue, which Sony offers a five-year extended warranty for. After sending it in to Sony, they now refuse to fix it because of what they claim is corrosion due to liquid damage. To my knowledge, no liquid damage had been done to the laptop, so I asked for pictures. The pictures they provided are nothing but dirt and cosmetic damage, which is going to happen with a 3-4 year old laptop. Last time I checked, being dirty did not void your warranty. None of the so-called \"damage\" has anything to do with the issue at hand, which is the fact that Sony produced a laptop that eventually begins to have problems with flickering in the screen. They KNOW they produced a laptop with this issue, yet they refuse to fix it. I have been around the bend several times with Sony customer service, and this whole experience has turned me from a loyal, dedicated Sony fan to someone who will never buy a Sony product again.To summarize: Sony refuses to stand by their products, even for problems that they acknowledge are their fault.
