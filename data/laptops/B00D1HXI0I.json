{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent", "Author": "R. L. Owen \"DUI Sparky\"", "ReviewID": "R1VRU5AMJ1Q5XF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this a year ago. It came with Win 8 on it, and I honestly tried to like Win 8. Seriously. For 6 months I used it with Win 8. I went the route of having to completely re-learn where all of the things I want are located within the OS. Exasperation was a daily occurrence - often multiple times a day - just trying to find simple things that used to be so easy to locate, or waiting for programs - even simple programs like Solitaire - to load. Finally, I gave up, wiped the HD and loaded Win 7 Pro. I've been happy ever since. Hardware wise, the unit is decent. I added more RAM and replaced the HD with an SDD for better performance. It's been a good, reliable laptop - well, ever since I installed Win 7 anyway.", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Seller was awesome", "Author": "lemcbee", "ReviewID": "RRYCEVKBRSOIS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this by mistake.  I did not want Windows 8, I was trying to order Windows 7 Professional.  I spent a lot of time picking one out and I swear it said it was Windows 7 Pro, but it arrived Windows 8 and when I looked at what it said I ordered it was the right thing.  The seller was awesome about letting me return it though.  I did have to pay a restock fee because I had unknowingly opened  the box before realizing I had a problem.  I will say that I have tried to figure out how to order a Windows 7 Pro but at this point hesitate in ordering any of them.  I also see how I made the error.  When you are reading the descriptions of the laptops they state Windows 7 Professional, but if you look further at specs or technical details, it changes to Windows 8.  At this point, I am just not sure exactly what to do about this dilemma.  Anyway, please understand my star up there does not reflect much on this laptop because I never even turned it on.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D1HXI0I"}}
