{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sony VGN-FW490", "Author": "Isaac", "ReviewID": "R25KIUPORDT7DW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At 6.5 pounds, the FW isn't the lightest laptop on the market, but it is probably the best value out there. Sony allows you to select a pre-built model or customize one yourself. My machine is customized:1080p LCD ScreenATI 4650 1gb Graphics Card2.53ghz Intel Core 2 Duo (3mb L2 Cache)4gb DDR2 @ 800mhz320gb Hard drive @ 7200rpmBlu Ray Player (Read only)Windows 7 64bit (came with Vista 64, but I upgraded when 7 came to campus)This machine is great for everything. Gaming, image editing, word processing, you name it, it can do it. It does get a bit hot, so lap use should be limited to the length of battery life which is roughly 2 to 2.5 hours. The keyboard is chiclet style and is unfortunately not back-lit. The speakers could be better, but I am usually wearing my MDR-500 Sony headphones (which I also recommend for people who like pop/rock music).The only complaints I have are centered around weight and placement of ports. Like I said, it is fairly heavy. I have a messenger bag that I used my first semester this year at Indiana University, and it got extremely heavy when dragging it around campus. I am going to find a backpack so that it is not as much of an issue. It is also worth noting that its 16.4 inch screen makes this thing fairly large so it take up a lot of real estate on your desk. VGA, HDMI, Ethernet, Firewire and Express Card slot are on the left side, and the tray loading Blu Ray drive and three USB ports are on the right. I would prefer if the USB ports and Blu Ray drive switched positions (drive moves forward and USB ports move backward), however, they work where they are.Build quality is pretty good. I always seem to compare any laptop against the unibody Macbook Pro, and the FW holds its own. Even though it is entirely made of plastic, it looks great and is of solid build quality.I chose the FW because it was the best deal on the market. I looked at every major brand and I could not find a cheaper computer with the same specs. In fact the only one that came close was, I believe, a Dell XPS. It was almost $200 more! The FW is a mulitmedia/gaming machine. It will play Crysis at 720p medium settings at 40 fps. All other games are playable at 1080p and high settings. It can also do some pretty hard core image editing. This a great all around computer.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just now starting to get old", "Author": "Evan", "ReviewID": "RZL67CIEVQLCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this computer since july of 2009. I have used it for everything, gaming (now low settings), autcad, matlab, surfing the web, watching videos. I have used the hdmi port numerous times and it has powered a 50\" 1080p tv with netflix and youtube, as well as a little gaming, but i like the screen on the laptop for gaming. my hardware is actually starting to age now so i must get another one. but after 5 years minus 4 months i'm impressed by the performance still. I'm using it to type this review. it runs boinc 24/7 right now and per core performance is still absolutely impressive. if you don't believe me or want to be surprised go compare this, the core2 duo p8700 to the haswell i7 4700mq on cpuboss. I still recommend this computer to friends that just want something that is usable for most anything. the gaming aspect has started to dwindle for sure, i get 4 fps in 3d mark 06.if your looking for something cheap, i know this laptops price has started to fall and i can vouch for it being able to take a lot of abuse. i have hit the processor over 106C, and it still flies. the design is nice, not too flashy. mine has a blu ray burner, or i guess had. my hard drive started to fail after 4 years, and my cd drive is the most finicky thing i have ever seen, if you don't treat it just right. it won't work. when i installed windows on my new hard drive, it was a race to click install before the disk spun down. there was less than a second free time to click everything i needed. once it spins down, it don't spin back up. same with burning cd/dvd's now if have to put the cd in and before it spins down i have to click burn. so it's old now, but a brand new one off a website that still has stock would be an awesome buy. last one i got for a buddy was under $400 for a 16.4\" screen, blu ray player, open source gaming machine. he was stoked, it ran excel, ubuntu, all the open source software. the only wall i hit was just recently in gaming, i couldn't test out the beta of a game i was excited to try because even on all low specs it won't hold the frame rate. plus it would crash. but if you aren't too into modern gaming, this thing will take you in low quality up to 2013 games, medium on games around 2009, absolutely high for anything under 2006. That is a lot of games!If you want possibly still the best deal on a laptop since 2009, buy this one. buy it for the past and finishing of everything you said you would. if modern gaming or high performance are your thing, this laptop is not for you, but if a smooth sailing laptop capable of doing anything you throw at it sounds just like what you want. get this bad boy.Just for information, i only grap laptops i think will be future proofed for about 5 years. and i found one that reminds me of this one when it first came out. though it's not middle high end of the road, it's high end. the clevo p177sm has some amazing reviews, plenty of upgrade possibilities, dual cooling fans, an i7 processor, a user replaceable gpu. so you can go from nvidia gtx to quadro to amd radeon. up to 32 gb ddr3 ram, 2 msata slots, 2x 2.5\" hard drive slots. no blu ray reader or burner, but i never once burned a blu ray.but that still doesn't match the elegance of this laptops performance. it's a middle of the road laptop that is capable of lasting 5 years, i can still do everything, though it might take a little push. I Highly Recommend this laptop!", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Sony VAIO FW Series VGN-FW490JEB\nCore 2 Duo P8700 / 2.53 GHz - Centrino 2 - RAM 4 GB - HDD 320 GB - BD-RE - Mobility Radeon HD 4650\nGigabit Ethernet - WLAN : 802.11 a/b/g/n (draft), Bluetooth 2.1 EDR - Vista Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "Sony VAIO VGN-FW490JEB 16.4\" Notebook (2.53GHz Core 2 Duo P8700 4GB RAM 320GB HDD Blu-ray Read/Write Vista Home Premium)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51zGlnUlJmL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002FM7F9U"}}
