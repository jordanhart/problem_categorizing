It's got loads of video processing power and speed, and a fine CPU for whatever the CPU is supposed to do, I suppose, though all ours is ever called on to do is Starcraft.  In other words, the vendor delivered what he promised: a powerful notebook computer aimed at the video game market.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "This laptop is a beast!", "Author": "TechnoMack", "ReviewID": "R11ZVSBS6ACSWH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is big, heavy and powerful.

The only issues I've had with it were the keyboard missing keystrokes and the GSOD issue which has been fixed.For those of you that have had bad luck with this notebook, rule of thumb is, Notebooks run hotter than desktops because of air flow restrictions. Buy a notebook cooler, I've had my G73JH on a Strike force 19 since day one, I've also had mine plugged into a APC power backup unit, 60.00 for surge protection and a warranty added to the devices plugged into it, can't beat that, anything gets hit by a surge, APC covers the repair! Also is wise to keep cans of compressed air on hand, dust is a notebooks worst nightmare. Blow those vents out good once a month, the cooler you keep this thing the longer it will last and the less problems you will have.I will admit the track pad isn't the greatest, but for me I did a search online for up to date drivers and once I installed the latest track pad drivers, I was able to actually use it without frustration, just a FYI to those of you with track pad problems.I also recommend upgrading your OS hard disk to a SSD drive, I installed a Intel X25 160GB ssd drive in mine and the performance is bitter sweet. Games on the Seagate momentus XT drive and the OS and apps are on the SSD.Also is wise to take your notebook in somewhere and have the thermal paste redone after a year, the crap Asus uses is terrible. Arctic Silver is the only way to go.  GPU runs at 73C while playing battlefield 3.Asus does have bad support but their products speak for themselves, every company produces lemons, but IMO asus puts out more honey than lemons.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "All the makings of a good machine but... ASUS sucks!", "Author": "Shrubz", "ReviewID": "R1WEXBG32YG8FH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this thing from best buy a little over a year ago. I have had unexplained crashes since about the 9 month mark and the track pad has NEVER worked correctly since it came out of the box. It has issues with a lot of games that I've tried to install and play. The original BioShock for example should be no problem for this machine, yet it took weeks of constant fiddling and google searching for fixes. Trying to get Battlefield 3 to run proved to be so frustrating; updating the catalyst drivers, then the BIOS,downloading, installing and blah blah blah that when those fixes didn't work I finally returned Battlefield 3 and purchased it for my PS3 instead... I have refrained from sending this thing in for repair, even though it is still covered under the warranty because of all the bad buzz I have heard about ASUS customer service/support and people having their laptops returned to them with more problems than they sent them in with. I have decided instead to sink the money into having a local computer repair place fix it for me even though I don't have the spare cash right now. I have had a previous ASUS G series laptop that was constant problems and crashed several times. My Fiance also has an older model from the G series line and although she had no problems for the first year, it is having crash issues now... All and all... ASUS is a bad company to look at if you're planning on buying a gaming laptop. They need to take their time and get something right rather than pushing out a new model every 6 months that doesn't work!", "Date": "January 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Read This before you buy.....", "Author": "Erniyer", "ReviewID": "R1AVTZA3Q3I08S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I ordered a laptop g73jh-rbbx05, first laptop came and had dead pixels. Exchanged it for a different one. Having trouble returning the original. Got the new one before the old one got picked up. Here's the amazing part.. the new one won't load windows... amazing how amazon have terrible quality control. I called ASUS for assistance and the only thing they can do is for me to send my laptop to them to get fixed (which is gonna cost money) and yet again do the dreaded waiting game... I expected so so much more from Amazon. What a mess.. Now I yet again have to do another waiting game just to return the 2nd broken laptop. So i have 2 laptops waiting to get picked up for return. Days of waiting for them and in the end nothing to show for it but contempt. If this isn't enough to deter you maybe you were just like me. I too read the bad reviews and thought maybe it was an isolated event or this could not possibly happen to me, or maybe you were thinking Amazon or ASUS would never give out bad products. I just hope no one has to go thru what i went thru.

By the beginning of September, it was no longer functional.  The charger started developing issues almost immediately, because it is one of those badly-designed chargers that sticks out too far from the body of the laptop.  Then, the non-skid pads came off the bottom.  Then, the vent on the back broke.  Today, I have received a replacement charger from Amazon, in the assumption that it would work with a new charger.  No dice!  The problem was not the charger, and now I have to figure out how to get my needed files off the machine before I need them in less than two days for a meeting.  It is very heavy and large, and looks as if you could throw it down the stairs, but I wanted a durable laptop.  Unfortunately, I did not get one.This machine has had issues from the start with the touch pad, which is extremely unreliable.  I had to attach an external mouse to it just to use it without frustration.  Also, the video has always had issues, because it shows a blue haze around areas on the screen where there is a lot of movement.  I was just trying to put up with all these issues, in the assumption that no more would develop.  I was wrong!

It is a tempting buy because of its specs, but PLEASE do not buy this computer. For anyone who depends on it for their work, especially if they travel abroad, their global warranty is false advertising. Repairs are only available at certain centers in the US and in other limited countries, making it almost impossible for users who travel outside of those regions to get service.

If everything on the laptop was in good shape, the only thing I could possibly complain about is the mouse pad, it drives me nuts, it skips and you need to press down very hard to click. So if you bought this PC brand new, that would be my only complaint.Now, the refurbished one I bought had several major issues. The guy who did the refurbishing must have been completely careless. CRACKED SUBWOOFER SPEAKER (Sounds terrible!), it came with software problems as well, the computer would say \"start-up is preparing your computer for first use\" each time you boot it up, so I started hibernating it instead to bypass the problem. What else... Oh yea, several burnt pixels on the screen. So, a cracked speaker, software issues and burnt pixels is what I got.

All told. I've been issued them from every place I work and have used a pile of different makes, models and designs throughout the past fifteen years. This is, bar none, far and away the worst of the lot.The summation of the failures of this monstrosity are these:* Out of warranty by less than one month, the 500GB drive begins to fail.* The trackpad has NEVER functioned correctly and ASUS despite having my contact information (remember that stuff we all put in to activate the warranty?) didn't seem fit to email me that the solution to the trackpad slamming the mouse right is to crack the case and fix their screw up.* The right side fan got loud, also a month out of warranty, due to impending failure.* Batteries? Never in stock and mine's totally dead. I never got more than an hour from it anyway.* Second slot for a drive and no cage for it - that's US$50 with shipping and you're on your own for the screws.* Atheros Wifi built it, which is has documented and unsolvable problems on mixed 802.11b/g/n networks.* Trackpad fails to track when the oils from your fingers build up on its surface - I've been using alcohol pads to clean it off to restore some semblance of functionality.* Video is glitchy at best - I've started getting screen flashing no matter what driver's installed.Their tech support is pretty much useless.
