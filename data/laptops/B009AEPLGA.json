I do not recommend.", "Author": "G. Anaya \"gaa53871\"", "ReviewID": "R3O6FXLEXZU9EN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for 2 weeks. It came with Win8 and it is very touchy like the other reviewer says. But I don't think it is Win8, I think it is this piece of junk touchpad. If you put too much pressure on the bezel next to the touchpad, the mouse jumps to another spot. I want to take a hammer to this piece of crap. The memory it came with, 4GB DDR3, is the worst in the market. I did some research and found out that the memory is slower than DDR2 in some cases. I purchase 8GB DDR3, Patriot brand, and it now runs faster and smoother. I do not recommend this laptop simply for the fact that the touchpad is garbage. I have a couple of IBM Thinkpads that I really love and I thought I would have the same experience but I was wrong. One of the problems with the touchpad is that there are no buttons, it is just a big rectangle with the buttons under the lower-left and -right corners. Sometimes they respond and sometimes they don't. JUNK!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPUTER IF YOU CAN AFFORD TO!!!", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excelente compra", "Author": "ELIS", "ReviewID": "R3FBCNP3YEEJ7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Contento con esta compra.La Entrega fue realizada a los tiempos establecidos, y es un producto que llego en buenas condiciones, recomendado 100%", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "windows 8 really isnt a good OS for a non touch screen laptop.
