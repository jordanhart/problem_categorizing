{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good laptop, but you get what you pay for.", "Author": "MBD", "ReviewID": "R1LN9WMZHA3SXF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Price, enough RAM for day-to-day work, good display with a decent graphics chip for video playback, very little bloatware, good wireless connectivity, runs relatively cool with good battery life, webcam.Cons: Said graphics chip isn't sufficient for gaming.  Likewise, the single-core processor is a tad sluggish for multi-tasking.  Not quite as bad as you'd think, but this is obviously not designed as a machine for gaming/zippy multi-media performance.[ ... ][This AMD sits around the middle in performance benchmarks, toward the later half of that range.  You can find some laptops in this price range with dual-core processors, albeit some with lower clock speeds combined with a bit less RAM.]For the money (bought mine on sale at Micro Center for $269), the Inspiron m5030 is a good, sturdy laptop.  Download Chrome, AVG and Malwarebytes, and you're good to go.  However, keep in mind that this is a budget priced-machine (and I'm rating it as such).  You get what you pay for.  This Dell will be great for internet surfing with 3 or 4 browser tabs open (one on youtube or Pandora, of course), listening/storing music, watching a movie here and there, word processing and the like.  But if you plan on playing graphically-intensive games or video editing while having a bunch of other programs running, look elsewhere.  Otherwise, this will easily get you through the day.", "Date": "August 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "worst computer I ever bought", "Author": "k. gadwell", "ReviewID": "R1K2B6LXU8EZ05", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My first laptop was a dell and I was happy.

It has been \"repaired\" three times by dell. All for problems with the laptop not charging or not recognizing the charger. Dells customer service is by far the worst that I have ever dealt with! The laptop is currently sitting under my desk waiting for me to figure out what to do with it since Dell in their infinite wisdom stated that my laptop would not charge due to \"damage\" that was not covered by my warranty. They said that the mother board needed to be replaced and i guess they did not want to cover their shotty equipment and wanted me to pay a 300 dollar service fee to have it repaired. I would say that is a bit ridiculous since that is almost the price of the laptop when i bought it. I will never buy another dell product due to their horrible customer service and cheaply made products. I expected a lot more from such a big name company. Buy a Sony Vaio if  you are looking for a well made product, I had one before the dell and bought another one after the dell stopped working.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "total POS", "Author": "luke marine \"luke a. marine II\"", "ReviewID": "R15BQH9GQ6HD60", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have worked on computers for about 15 years and this is one of the worst laptops that i have ever had the displeasure of working on. there have been about 4 of these things that have came into my store, with 3 of them having a motherboard failure and the other one with a failed optical drive. all of these machines were about 2 months past the end of their warranties. i personally do own one and it is a total POS. i have had the HD fail on it once, and the motherboard failed. luckily, i was able to do a solder reflow on it by baking it in the oven. the fact that the solder structurally failed on a 1 and 1/2 year old motherboard shows me that the build quality is crap and the company doesn't care about making a decent computer. this is the last dell that I ever intend to purchase and I will never recommend buying one to one of my customers ever again. if you want a bang for your buck and a decent, reliable laptop, i would definitely suggest a toshiba or an HP.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Problematic laptop!", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "RV7GW36OX17BZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have tech support workshop and I have seen 3 of this laptops with motherboard problems, all of them less than 2 years old, don't waste your money!", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00574IS8A"}}
