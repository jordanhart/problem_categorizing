Horrible Dell support.", "Author": "Marcelo", "ReviewID": "RKHB1FO6961SK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I finally took the time to write this review.Four months ago I decided to change my old notebook and buy a top notebook. After a lot of research I decided to pick this Dell XPS 15Z, due to its good hardware specifications, high screen resolution and good aluminium casing. No one can denies this notebook looks beautiful, but it doesn't worth the problems it brings.To be more specific, I will write one by one the troubles that I have with this piece of problems.1. As soon as I turned it on, I could already notice that the fan makes a strange noise once in a while. You can see further details about it if you google \"XPS 15z grinding noise\". There will be plenty of results to prove that maybe all the piece sold come with this problem.2. After one or two months, the notebook started to show a blue screen of death whenever I would turn it on. For first I thought it was a hardware problem, since usually the BSoD is related to it. So I decided to use the Dell recovery tool, which basically restores your computer to the original factory image. When performing this procedure, the DataSafe tool (a backup tool provided by Dell) said all my files would be available on my Desktop after rebuilding the factory image. And yes, they there. However, what I didn't know was that all my files would be encrypted and that the DataSafe tool provided by Dell wouldn't be able to open them. Whenever I would try to open my files, the program would tell me the files were corrupted. Resuming everything, I lost all my files. I even tried to make use of the online support provided by Dell. A guy connected on my notebook and seemed to have no idea on what he was doing (he basically tried to open the files, the same thing I did).3. I tried to make use of the change of ownership tool provided by Dell since I am currently living in Brazil. Seriously, I have contacted them more than 10 times and this change is always denied after some days of wait. I have never had so much trouble with support in my whole life.4. Today, out of sudden, the trackpad went crazy. Whenever I touch it, the arrow starts behaving in a random way. And guess what, I typed trackpad crazy on google and got many results. It seems like the trackpad is unstable with several drivers and I haven't found a solution for it yet.To resume everything. I am extremely sad that Dell didn't create a quality product. Seriously, it looks like that problems are appearing all the time and sometimes they suddenly disappear. And actually I was pretty much convinced that all Dell products were good when I was buying this notebook. So, I changed my mind and really wouldn't recommend anyone to buy this PIECE OF PROBLEM.", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Most expensive laptop I have ever own", "Author": "Amer", "ReviewID": "R3E745U6XQQP0A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": null, "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great alternative to MacBook", "Author": "Brice E.

This was not a simple task, since this laptop is so small and thin, doing something as simple as swapping the hard disk, or replacing the battery, requires a somewhat complicated disassembly.  Fortunately, I found a guide on YouTube that pointed out all the pitfalls as you're going in.On the \"small and thin\" note ... it's really quite cool.  Thin, light weight, covered with an aluminum/titanium alloy that looks nice but might scratch, and still large enough to hold a 15\" full 1920x1080 native glass LED screen.  I like the look and feel of the back-lit keypad, but I'm not crazy about the glide-pad, but that's ok, since I use a Bluetooth mouse most of the time anyway.  I've seen many people knocking it because they say it looks like a Mac-book Pro., this may be true, and it does seem to have all the exact same I/O ports in the same locations, including the Mac \"Mini Display Connector\", but I don't care, I like it.This laptop (XPS 15Z), had one little quirk that threw me for a loop because I never had to deal with it before, but once I figured it out, I'm really quite happy with it.  That quirk is the \"Optimus\" system that manages the two different graphics adapters, the low power Intel GPU, and the high power nVidia GPU.  Many Linux users seek out systems with nVidia graphics, because nVidia likes Linux, and in previous systems, I simply set the BIOS to only use the nVidia GPU.  This laptop does not allow that option, forcing you to learn how to manage the Optimus hardware.  In a MS Windows system, virtually all of the applications have a profile file associated with it, and the OS passes part of the profile to Optimus, which determines if the high power nVidia GPU is needed.  In Linux, you have to use an application like \"Bumblebee\" to manage Optimus, and decide for yourself if the application you're using requires the nVidia GPU.  It's really quite simple to create a launcher that starts your favorite apps. with the nVidia GPU enabled, but you have to know that it needs to be done. Also, every high power 3D graphics app. that I've tried so far, will actually run with only the Intel GPU, just very slowly.Under minimal power conditions (display brightness at minimum, keyboard back-light off, WiFi and Bluetooth off, nothing plugged in to the USB ports, Ethernet cable plugged in, Intel GPU only), I get about 6 hrs. 20 mins. on the battery ... not bad.  An interesting side note, simply turning on the nVidia GPU cuts that down to about 40 mins., also the fan gets a little loud when nVidia is running full blast.Addendum:  We have a huge fire burning here in So. Cal., and power lines got knocked down this morning, so we had a lengthy power failure.  I kicked this laptop into low gear, connected it by tethering to my cell phone (which means WiFi), and I got over 7 hours of battery life with the WiFi turned on.  Apparently, WiFi uses less power than wired Ethernet on this machine.I've jumped through all the hoops to get this thing running perfectly under Linux (Fedora 18), so if you're considering this laptop as a Linux machine, and need some help, just ask.By the way, there are a few misprints, even contradictions, in Amazons' product description.  A couple of important notes that helped me decide to buy this machine are:  The nVidia GPU is a \"GeForce GT 540M\", and the native resolution of the glass is a full 1920 x 1080.For the geekier readers, here are a few numbers:glxgears with Intel GPU only:$ glxgearsRunning synchronized to the vertical refresh.
