I paid $671.00 which is a good price for the specs. I use it now to surf the internet and anticipate using it in the near future for class assignments.Well I was going to give this 4 stars until the computer shut down only a few seconds after giving me a warning that my battery life is at 10 percent. It's plugged in now so here goes...Well, this thing looks good. It's sleek, light weight, runs fast, fits in a large purse and has great screen resolution. It stays pretty cool to the touch. But battery life is a pain, especially since its overall design would make it a wonderful little mobile computer. I adjusted the screen brightness to below 50 percent and it still only worked for about 3.5 hours instead of the 5 hours stated in the specs. (My cel phone stays on longer than that after being charged.) There is an extended battery, and although it's not bulky, I really don't like the idea of having to screw the thing on to extend the battery life. I seriously considered returning this and paying more for an ultrabook with a longer battery life that doubles as a tablet. There is a touchscreen keyboard but I don't really see the use of it unless it can be flipped back like a tablet. You can't have everything you want at a certain price point but the battery life should definitely be better than it is.Update 12/17/13I've given in to using the extended battery and enjoy using the computer a lot more now. It stays up and running for about 6 hrs or so. The battery is simple enough to attach and actually gives it a little bit of an incline which makes typing a little more comfortable in my opinion. Although, I think it detracts from the overall sleek design. Overall, I don't regret my purchase.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Spike Cover \"Spike\"", "ReviewID": "R3H2AUVOVJKQS7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Acer Aspire S7-191-6640 11.6-Inch Touchscreen UltrabookI've owned this ultrabook for several months now.  I love it.  I have a big, fast desktop w/ a 30\" Dell (2960x1600) monitor but find myself using this little gem.  It's kind of like a minicooper, i.e., fun to drive.I love the screen rez and the quickness. I attach the extra battery and leave it plugged in when I'm home.  That makes it ready to go on the road.I use Start menu 8 (making 8 look like 7) because Win 8  has little or no advantage for me and I'm not into relearning for no gain.I use a 64GB micro SD card (permanently resident in the machine), have a 1TB external drive (only plugged in when I heed stuff xfered from the big machine) and an external blu-ray player writer (just for fun).If I could only buy an extra add-on battery and take it with me when I'm not near power, I'd figure this was a decent work-around for the crummy battery life.Anyone know where to get such an extra battery?Found one here for $150! [...]  yikes!Bad stuff:The keyboard has shallow action which requires some getting used to.I've turned off the track pad (Fn + T keys) and use the mouse so that my hand doesn't activate the track pad when I'm typing.  Plus it difficult to impossible to choose a small item with the end of your finger. So, I prefer and use a mouse.The bluetooth mouse that comes with the ultrabook doesn't always connect quickly or well but I've learned how to compensate.Bottom line: I like the machine and am glad I bought it.  I'm hoping new battery technology and Intel's new lower-power processors will allow mfgrs to improve the time away from being plugged in.Extra comment: I wish MS would stop making changes that produce little or no user advantages but are just different.  I think we all know that they'd love to take over the world and have their system used on our phones, tablets and computers.  If they had a real one-size-fits-all system, that would be fine.  They missed that mark with Win 8.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "A slick little laptop", "Author": "Dustin Wood", "ReviewID": "R3GRDBTK5IE8U0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This thing is nice. I was replacing a 4 year old Toshiba Ultrabook. And I must say, I'm really impressed with everything about it.Its very slim and lightweight. Its just only slightly thicker than the monitor lid of the Toshiba I had.Its powerful too. I believe the Windows Experience number is 5.9 for desktop graphics I think. I did hit a number over 8. I loaded up Skyrim to test. It automatically set all the graphic settings to low at 1080p resolution. It plays smooth at that resolution. I'm guessing I could probably bump up a few settings and it'd still be fine.I loaded up Windows 8 on my Toshiba, and I hated it. It felt like two OS's ducted tape together. But figured it felt that way, because it was meant for touch screens. And the Metro side of the OS looked like it would be enjoyable as a tablet OS. But now after having this Acer with a touch screen, I still hate Windows 8. Its still two OSs duct taped together. The trackpad was doing things between windows that I couldn't understand. I had to look up the settings to realize that if you start your finger off the trackpad, and bring it into the side, it will scroll through previously opened screens. Was very frustrating. And after I tried to use it as is out of the box, I still did the same thing. So I shut off that option. And you know what, most of my grip with the system is about the trackpad. So I'll just stop because I could go on. Not saying it doesn't work. It does. Its just been designed to do way too much, and also mimics Apples single pad with clicking built in. I hate that.Comes with an extra battery, which is nice. It takes a minute to figure out how its supposed to attach. But stays on secure when you screw in the two screws.Also comes with a slip case. Its nice and snug. Will also work with the extra battery if you put the laptop in flipped around, with the battery hanging out.Photoshop loads quick, and works really smooth.Its a good ultrabook. Much slimmer and lighter than most of the ones you see at department stores. Very similar to the Apple Air. Also can't wait until Microsoft releases Windows 8.1, where you can boot directly to the desktop and they give you back the normal start button. Too many extra clicks to find stuff in Windows 8, compared to all the previous versions.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice little ultra-portable", "Author": "BenjaminJ", "ReviewID": "R3Q61YUZI1OXRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is beautiful, light and has the best screen you can find on a Windows PC in this form factor.

Once you get used to it, it's perfectly fine.SPEED:The time it takes to boot to the home screen from a cold start: 10.0 secondsThe time it takes to boot to the home screen from sleep: 2.0 secondsThe time it takes to fully shut down: 10.0 secondsBATTERY:Full charge, Youtube videos, highest quality, brightest and loudest settings:  2:00-2:30 hoursFull charge, MS Office work, brightest settings: 2:30-3:00 hoursAdd an additional 2-3 hours to each of the above when using the external battery pack.  Add an additional hour if using the lowest brightness and power saving features (you'll kill your eyes in the process though).The included external battery (+190 grams) is tricky to get on.  Find some videos on youtube for more info on how to get it on.Battery charges quite slowly when you're using this thing intensively but very quickly when it's shut down.HARD DISK/CPU/FAN:You're down to 77 GB of usable space after installing all the updates.  Super fast.  Quiet most of the time unless doing something intensive, then you can hear the little fan buzzing a bit.SCREEN:Amazing HD quality.  Sublime.  For something this small it's utterly impressive.DO NOT go off of other people's reviews (on other tech review sites) that claim such a resolution is way too high for such a small screen.  That's completely terrible advice.  As soon as you change the settings and increase the icon and font size everything is bigger than the icons on your local Ipad.  Perfectly visible text and icons even at a distance with NO loss in quality.  I.E. the icons and text don't become pixelated when you blow them up at the higher resolution.TOUCH TECHNOLOGY:Easy touch screen navigation.  Screen is perfectly sensitive.  Will smudge the screen with your fingers though but you won't notice it until the screen is black.When you get this computer, and need to access the side bar, make sure to start swiping your finger from right to left just beyond the edge of the visible screen to make sure the bar appears every time, otherwise you'll get frustrated if you try to aim your finger to the very right edge of the screen every time.It'll take some time to get used to the windows 8 touch technology, but in about 20 minutes of playing around you'll be buzzing around it like on your Ipad.CAMERA:Definitely not HD, but good enough for a quality Skype call.SPEAKERS:Loud enough for your regular movie.  Nothing special but not that bad either.KEYBOARD:Nice backlightOVERALL:If the short battery life is not of a concern to you, this is hands down the best piece of machinery for a comparable screen size you can get for $750.If you want a decent battery life with very similar other specs, you're looking at a $1,200-$1,500 machine.Your call.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "Lexi", "ReviewID": "R18UFZ2VR5DIAM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was concerned that the screen size would be too small, but it's just perfect! Everything on Windows you're able to zoom to view it closer. Windows 8 was an adjustment, but after a few days of some frustration, I would say I have it mostly down pat. The touch screen feature is fantastic, I love it. Also love how this product came with a nice mouse that makes everything even easier to use. The keys are just right for typing and also have a back-lit feature. The start-up is incredibly fast. The battery life isn't exactly ideal, but if you charge it every night then it gets most of the daily task complete with a low battery at the end of the day. If you're going somewhere, just be sure to pack along either the power cord or the extra battery that also comes with to offset the short battery life. It's also incredibly light. As a college student, I'm able to pack it in with all of my books without worrying about adding too much weight or not wanting to carry it, it's only about an additional 2 lbs. Love it!

I am very careful with this laptop and I tried to keep it in mint condition so it can last me for a while in college. Over time, no matter how careful I am with it, a lot of things are damaged and I begin to see how fragile the build is.At first, I loved the laptop and thought it was amazing, great speed and I could do anything I need on it.The battery life is not very good at all and attaching the external battery to it makes it normal. The external battery looks very ugly and could have been much better to match how nice the laptop itself looks and I was reluctant to use it.The update to windows 8.1 made everything seem easier to operate because it fixed the scaling of the windows to make it easier to touch.The damages I regret to inform you about involve the bottom of the laptop which is made of plastic. There is a little crack right by the usb port, the rubber padding on the top where the screws for the external battery go into has ripped off and the micro sd card broke. When I try plugging in a micro sd card in, it reads it, but does not hold it in place because the spring inside has been damaged over time.In addition for those of you who are unaware, the laptop claims to have \"a\" 120gb ssd. That is a big lie, the laptop actually has two 60gb ssds which are running in raid0. The problem with that is, yes it does combine the speed of both drives allowing it to run faster, but raid0 also decreases the life expectancy of the drives. If one drive fails, all your data will be corrupted regardless of the other drive available. In addition, raid0 also does not allow the trim function in windows 8 or 8.1 making data management less efficient.My final verdict, yes this is a nice looking laptop, fast, light with a nice 1080p ips display, but over time you will start to experience problems and see the true quality of the laptop. Personally, I regret purchasing it and wish I went with either a microsoft surface or a laptop with better build quality regardless of size and looks.", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Never Ever Buy ACER product", "Author": "Viksmicro", "ReviewID": "R2I8C8UMDFK4YB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop nearly 6 months ago..

Yoon", "ReviewID": "R1TX13S65FQWH9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this after many days of researching, actually weeks..  I wanted something that is very light and portable with long battery life and with touch screen window 8.  What attracted me most were few points : extra bettery that come with it.  (some people complain that it looks awkward, but considering how thin this ultrabook is, you have to give up something to get extra battery life. for me, it was good).  Very light and good looking (I give 5 stars).  right size for travelling.  good pricing compared to other more brand name ultrabooks.  excellent screen quality and fit and finish of the products.for the bads........typing on key board is somewhat difficult.  I do not know exactly why but i think that it is bad design of key boards (the feel is not right).  for some reason, once in a while, it shuts down and the screen turns to green.  again, I do not know why it happens, but whenever it does, i have to restart.  In one ocasion, It got totally frozen and I have to press the reset button.  Touch screen is too sensitive.The worst thing for me was Bluetooth feature.  I wanted to connect with bluetooth speaker, but the connection was keep dropping or was not connecting AFTER I PUT THE ULTRABOOK TO SLEEP OR TURN IT OFF AND ON (EITHER COMPUTER OR THE SPEAKER) and to get it working, I had to remove the speaker application entirely from computer and re-install.  That was almost every time I wanted to use bluetooth speaker which became so much hassel.  Initially I thought that it was the faults of the speaker (I bought the best reviewed $199 Bose speaker. Awesome sound, but this problem), but after trying out so many others (Bose, Sony, HMDX...etc) I realized that it is my ultrabook. (by the way, I struggled with this for many days and even down load new wireless/bluetooth software from ACER home page, but still did not work properly)  However, fortunately London Duo Bluetooth speaker was compatible with ACER Ultrabook.  That was the only bluetooth speaker without the problem of not connecting.Anyway, my final thought about this ultrabook is that this is a decent ultrabook and pretty good one for the pricing.
