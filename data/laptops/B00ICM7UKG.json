{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Purchased locally", "Author": "BobbieK", "ReviewID": "R3TVOU65KDPWKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My 15 month old Lenovo Thinkpad Twist got a bad case of terminal BSOD. I will be working to repair, but needed an IMMEDIATE solution - a local store was offering this one at about 2/3 the price here on Amazon as a special deal, and I grabbed it.Since it is local, I did not have the \"battery problem\" some have experienced on other Toshiba Satellites from Amazon. I was willing to take the risk knowing the local store would stand behind the sale. I tested all of the issues others have reported (including the DVD reader - no problems) it works seamlessly.It is about 2 pounds heavier than my other computer (full weight is 5.4 pounds), but that is because it is LARGER than the other one. I love the nice bright screen, and am enjoying being able to read \"stuff\" better than a smaller screen. Unlike some, I use my laptop at home most of the time, and 2 pounds isn't a big deal.My last one was an ultra - I love having this one where I can replace the battery myself and have a spare on hand for long trips. I really do love having the Superdrive, meaning I can watch a DVD, play a CD, import songs, burn CDs. You don't realize how often you want these features until you have a computer without it.It responds slightly more slowly than the Lenovo I had, but well within tolerable allowances. I notice it most on loading internet pages. But slightly means just a tiny bit. It takes about four seconds longer to start up following a restart.It has a full keyboard, with a 10-key pad on the right. The keyboard is \"flat\" without raised keys, but have a slightly raised point on the J and F keys making it easy to find your spot.The touchpad (I use a trackball because of carpal tunnel) is configured the way I prefer, with the two buttons on the bottom. I used the memory card reader to transfer some files (some by Drop Box) and it read the card rapidly and transferred the files quickly. I am happy with that.With three USB ports, I can easily keep my trackball at hand and yet charge my iPhone if I want, and still have room to pop in a flash drive. Only one of the USB ports is 3.0, and you can change the setting to make it into a 2.0 if you want to save battery time.The screen is bright, and I am very happy with it. It is NOT touchscreen - something I am happy about. A touchscreen also is an energy hog, and I seldom used mine. Glad to go back to simple.NOTE - if you haven't used Windows 8, you will have a hard time adjusting, but that isn't the computer's fault. :-) This one comes pre-installed with 8.1 which I had already wanted. It adds functionality to Windows 8, although it doesn't compensate for everything that is a problem. You do NOT need a touchscreen to run Windows 8. I have an iPad and iPhone and am very used to touch, but didn't need it on Windows 8.While I purchased it as an \"emergency\" fill in, I will likely keep it as my primary laptop ... it is that good. I took off the star because I felt it was a tiny bit slower, and because I feel documentation could have been better for new users. However as an \"older user\" of Windows 8, everything installed seamlessly for me.", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer if you're only searching for the basics", "Author": "Stasi Schulze", "ReviewID": "R1QY0P5HH42D4R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My old Toshiba (which was much more expensive than this one and was basically a rocket when it comes to speed) was dying after use for at least 4-5 years. I was very pleased with that laptop so I figured I'd just purchase another Toshiba. I needed a computer ASAP for all of my schoolwork, and this is (I'm pretty sure) one of the cheapest computers Toshiba offers. I had a feeling I could fix my old computer at the time, so I bought the cheapest one they had.I really don't have any complaints. The graphics are great, sound is perfect, quality of videos/movie watching is great, etc.The only complaints I really DO have is that it responds a bit slower than most computers, directly from the get-go. When you're used to computers with lightning speed, a page that takes at least 30 seconds to load seems like a lifetime (even though for us who have used Dial-Up know it's a blessing!).It also seems like (straight out of the box, mind you) Youtube is too advanced for the computer. I think it has to do with Youtube cluttering up the website with so many video ads and pictures that when you go to actually watch a video, the computer is too focused on the previous ads on the page. The sound moves faster than the videos, and I literally can't move my mouse or go to full-screen without the video failing to work properly. That is only the problem with Youtube, however. All other video players work great.The texture of the laptop looks cool (the surface is all tiny raised bumps, just not on the keyboard). However, when you use the keypad for a good amount of time, at least for me, the texture of the surface REALLY bothers the pads of my fingers to the point where I had to get off the computer.The last thing is that if you're looking for a good gaming computer, this is NOT the computer for you. This computer is the lowest of lows when it comes to Toshiba computers and it is NOT MEANT FOR GAMING. Take my word on it. My family is a huge gaming family and I can't even play the basic (no add-ons) The Sims 3 for PC because it just lags so bad. Unfortunately, the better the gaming computer, the more expensive. I would highly recommend Razer computers for gaming, but those not your basic computer. $$$The computer does NOT come with Microsoft Office, so that is something to think about when purchasing a new laptop.Pros\u2022Nice, sleek design\u2022Great graphics\u2022Sound quality is perfect\u2022Video player/music players work great.\u2022Bright screen\u2022Windows 8.1 is easy to navigate\u2022Decent battery life\u2022CheapCons\u2022Youtube doesn't respond well\u2022No Microsoft Office\u2022Windows 8.1 comes built in, *will* take some getting used to.\u2022Despite sleek design, the texture of the design bothers the pads of my fingers.\u2022Bad for gaming.In other words, you're really getting what you pay for. If you just need the basics, this is perfect--if you want something a little bit more advanced, you'll have to pay higher.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop!", "Author": "Running Bear", "ReviewID": "R86TJVMW3U70L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this wonderful laptop for my son, whose old computer was dying.

Under the product description, it said NEW, not refurbished, not used, but NEW. Well, it arrived quickly (as usual w/ amazon) and cosmetically it looked new. Not a scratch or smudge on it. However, as I tried to enter my personal information, someone failed to remove the previous owner's name and information. Talk about easy identity theft. If I had wanted an used laptop, there were plenty to choose from. I am very disappointed with the integrity of the 3rd party to try and sell something as new when it obviously wasn't.
