{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Bigger Brother", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R21TXO8G6H5LP4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "HP's Chromebook 14 is our third Chromebook because, after one year with Samsung Chromebook I came to realize that not only a Chromebook does almost everything a laptop or a PC or a tablet would do for me but it does it cheaper, usually faster and better, almost always worry-free and very much in style. We've ordered a nice HP Chromebook 11 since and now, because someone in our household wanted a one that was 'bigger', we went for the '14'.WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.\u02d5 Our Chromebooks are our most used computers excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.\u02d5 Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.\u02d5 Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chromium wasn't cracked yet.\u02d5 Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.\u02d5 Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.\u02d5 Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.\u02d5 The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.\u02d5 Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.\u02d5 Chromium being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.\u02d5 Relatively low prince, 11.6\" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.HP's CHROMEBOOK 14 vs. Chromebook 11Having owned two other Chromebooks already, from the start, it was a very familiar feeling. HP's 14 is not 'exactly like' Samsung's and this big HP is quite different from HP's Chromebook 11 but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook.Here are some changes:\u02d5 DISPLAY: HP 11's colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down. HP 14's is not as bright and the larger size doesn't come with better resolution.\u02d5 KEYBOARD. It's a draw. I like both keyboards as they have a good layout and nice travel. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both.\u02d5 DESIGN: HP 11's is more stylish design but they are both Okay as far as I can tell. HP 11 is nicer though.\u02d5 PORTS: This is where the HP 14 wins big time. It comes with USB 3.0 ports vs. HP 11's USB 2.0 and full HDMI.\u02d5 POWER: It's not too obvious but yes, the HP 14 is sometimes faster refreshing screens. Videos play equally smoothly on both.\u02d5 SIZE AND WEIGHT: HP 14 is a lot heavier so if you travel and size and weight matters then HP 11 is the right choice. If your Chromebook is mostly homebound and most of your computing and media playing takes place in a room shielded from direct or indirect sunlight then the HP 14 gives you the bigger display advantage.Overall I like HPs larger Chromebook. It has better ports options than the HP 11, it's faster and you get a bigger screen on a body that's not as light and pretty.RATINGI am not going to compare a 300 dollar HP Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because Chromebooks and this particular one are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.HP's 14 is a four-star to me because it's at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung but I personally prefer the HP 11. As far as performance, they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just as nice as expected", "Author": "Just another Music/Web/Technology Lover \"rdf\"", "ReviewID": "RTJWBT025KO5A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had high hopes for this laptop.  I already knew the differences between a chromebook and a typical PC, so no issues there.I picked up this system from Walm*** a few days ago.  The model I purchased also includes 2 years of Tmobile data.I specifically choose the HP 14\" model because of its quality and size.  Much better size than the competing 11.5\" systems.  Also, true to HP, nice quality.Size, speed, quality, keyboard, trackpad are all great.  If I had one negative it would be the lack of lighted keyboard.  On the plus side, the system I received has 4 GB ram, so an upgrade from the 2 GB listed on Amazon.  This system fits its intended use perfectly.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really nice machine... feels very \"Apple\" inspired, great second computer", "Author": "Goldengate \"Goldengate\"", "ReviewID": "RDUTXQRIXBLVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the 4G version of this for fifty more at the local W-Mart.  The other big difference between that model and this one is that the version with the roaming T-mobile data plan (free for 2 years) also has 2 GB more memory so theoretically the machine should be faster than the wi-fi only version.I'll review the things in common however.Screen:  Good size, easy to adjust brightness with dedicated up and down keys at the top of the keyboard (just like Apple).  I'm reading that the Chromebook 11 version has a nicer display and that the 11 was actually co-created with Google vs. the 14 which was supposedly designed solely by HP.Appearance:  I got the machine in white.  Snow White to be exact.  It looks awesome on the kitchen counter.  The aluminum cover around the keyboard looks great and reminds me of much more expensive Apple machines.  (OK I'll stop mentioning Apple, the whole darn thing reminds me of a $1500 Apple in appearance)Speakers:  I'm listening to Pandora as I type this.  Zero bass response but speakers still sound decent for listening to music, but if you want bass, this is NOT the machine for you.  There is a headset jack.Connections:  Speaking of jacks, there are two USB ports on the left and one on the right. There's also a HDMI output on the left so you can stream video and audio to your TV.Usability:  No, you can't easily run Microsoft Excel and Outlook on this machine.  I've read you can remote into your networked desktop and use them there but I haven't used that.  However Gmail and the Google cloud based equivalents of the Office Suite are fine.  This machine starts up almost instantly... it's like turning on a phone.  You turn it on and moments late you are checking gmail and Facebook and surfing the web.I wouldn't want this as my only computer as I do need a non-cloud based computer as well, but as an inexpensive mobile computer I find this a great alternative to my iPad at half the cost.I asked Amazon if they will be selling the 4G version of this and really didn't get a definitive answer but I'm guessing since WM is already \"live\" with it that they have some sort of an exclusive deal for now.Also, rumor has it that Toshiba and Asus will be coming out with Chrombooks for the holidays so you might want to wait to see what they offer.My biggest concern about this model was the 2 GB of memory in the wifi only version...  the reviews of other Chromebooks I've read (and I've read dozens) indicate to me that Chrome really operates best with 4 GB if you like to have lots of open tabs.A great little machine!!!", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "An outstanding device", "Author": "Krisztian Koncz", "ReviewID": "R3RSORGOVYG9IA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I bought My chromebook 14 in the UK, it is not available on amazon UK yet, I had to buy it direct from HP. Like the T-mobile version here, mine comes with a built in HSPA+ radio that gives me superfast mobile internet in the area of London where I live, on par with wifi speeds pretty much. This is the first product I reviewed that got a 5-star rating although perhaps 4.75 stars would have been more accurate. The tiny flaws that it does have are balanced out by the stupendously low price, basically this is a machine you can easily compare to a macbook or a windows ultrabook that costs 4 times as much an it will still hold its own. Obviously this is a Chrome OS device so one has to do their research if they can live with a cloud-based OS and there is a very small learning curve when switching, but honestly Chrome OS is so easy to learn, almost anyone should be able to do it. I also wrote a detailed and critical review looking at every little aspect of the device, meant for chromies who are already sold on the concept but need comparisons with other chromebooks available on the market. For my money, this particular model is the best chromebook you can get out there, factoring in things like price, battery life, 4g connectivity and screen size. Without further ado here are my initial impressions:Initial Impressions about the HP chromebook 14 UK 3G version and comparison to the Samsung series 3Feel and QualityThis is definitely a laptop, it feels very different from the samsung, the weight is substantial, it is much bigger and the fan is constantly on and very much audible. I suppose I will just have to get used to the noise, but that is definitely a step back from the Samsung. Some reviewers noted they can only hear the fan when they put their ears next to the keyboard, definitely not the case with me, I hear it all the time when I\u2019m in a quiet room. When I take it to the kitchen, where there is a lot of ambient noise from the fridge, it gets cancelled out and I can\u2019t hear a thing. Most people probably won\u2019t even notice the fan unless they use it at night in their bedrooms.KeyboardThe keyboard has a different feel to it than the samsung, it has textured keys and they keys have slightly more travel. Annoyingly, the keyboard is narrower than on the samsung despite the bigger size of the machine itself, so you get narrower enter, backspace and shift keys. The keyboard otherwise feels good and it is quite silent to type on, but not as much as on the samsung, perhaps that will change with time. The keys are not as rounded as on the samsung and I must say I prefer the typing experience on the samsung so far, but maybe I\u2019ll get used to it in a few days. There is more key travel on the HP, that is definitely in its favour.TrackpadThe trackpad is the same width but slightly taller. I feel no difference in practical use, however the HP has a slightly loose trackpad that rattles every time I tap to click, which is annoying, so I find myself preferring to actually click the trackpad. Thankfully the trackpad requires less pressure to click than on the samsung and the noise is more satisfying. The loose trackpad feels cheap, I\u2019m not sure if this is an issue with my machine in particular or if it is more widespread.ScreenThe 14\u201d screen makes a huge difference in comparison to the Samsung, I don\u2019t have to put on my glasses and I don\u2019t have to zoom in or squint to see text properly. The bigger screen is the main reason I bought this machine and overall I\u2019m satisfied. I did not find the lower PPI to be an issue, you tend to sit a bit further away anyways. The lack of an anti-glare coating is preferable in my case, text appears to be clearer and more crisp. The screen does reflect when switched off, I see no reflections when it is switched on, I keep it at about 80 percent brightness. Reflections from the blazing sun is not an issue we have to grapple with here in the UK. Maximum brightness appears to be about 10 percent higher than on the samsung, it is definitely noticeable and a welcome change. On the other hand contrast ratios are worse and colours are more washed out than on the samsung. Next to each other, the same background photo shows truer colours on the samsung, the setting sun is more orangey. The HP seems to struggle with contrast, for instance a light skinned person on a white background looks quite bad. Also, I find that I need to tilt the screen quite a bit back to get decent contrast ratios when writing and reading text on a white background, then when I watch videos I have to tilt the screen a bit forward to get better colour reproduction. It seems that constantly adjusting the screen is just something that comes with TN panels. But like I said, overall this is a pretty good screen for the price.Materials and Build qualityThis is where the HP truly shines compared to the samsung. This is a beautiful machine, well made, sturdy, quality materials, and the heft seems to add to the quality feel. The plastics used are much thicker than on the samsung, there is no creak when you pick it up. Mine is the snow white colour which is just amazingly gorgeous, I\u2019m truly in love with the look and feel of this. This all comes at a price though, the bottom half of the machine is twice as thick as the samsung, the height difference is noticeable when you are typing on the table. As for weight, this is no macbook air, I definitely won\u2019t be carrying this around as much. I plan to keep this for home use and take the samsung with me when I\u2019m out and about.PerformanceI did not get the opportunity to test this extensively, so these are just initial impressions. My Samsung has increased scrolling performance markedly on the beta channel and when I go to google plus or the notoriously heavy Verge I see no difference between the two machines in normal scrolling. The HP seems to drop frames just as much as the samsung. Where I see a real difference is in loading times, pages load in about half the time on the HP and the waiting time to be able to scroll without jerkiness or checkerboarding is also about half of what you get on the samsung. Same goes for switching between tabs. Where the HP 14 really leaves the samsung in the dust is watching HD videos, there is just no comparison. The Samsung can just about handle HD streaming in netflix, but when it comes to youtube or other flash-based streaming sites, it struggles to play videos smoothly, there are missed frames, jumping and jerkiness. Also, I found that with the samsung switching between resolutions or going full window and back is problematic and really taxes the cpu. No such problems here, the HP plays everything beautifully, HD videos are crisp and fluid, they look beautiful on the large, glossy screen. Perhaps the only drawback of the glossy screen is when you watch dark scenes, you can see your own reflection a bit, but not a huge issue overall. The speakers are loud and clear, they are noticeably more powerful than the one on the samsung. Of course there is zero base, but they are still fine speakers for a laptop. Overall, if you like to watch videos and movies on your chromebook, the HP leaves the samsung in the dust, image quality, fluidity, responsiveness and speaker sound are all superior, but that is to be expected from a bigger machine.ConnectivityWifi performance is fine, same as the samsung, picks up signals easily. This model comes with mobile internet included. In the UK, as in the US it is an HSPA+ wireless radio. In the US this is marketed as 4G, in the UK this is considered 3G or 3.5G according to some marketing materials. It is faster than normal 3G, but it won\u2019t be up to LTE speeds. The network provider is Fogg Mobile, a Swedish telecom company who have effectively outsourced the service to Three. I already have a mobile phone contract with Three and mobile internet speeds in my area are relatively fast (Wapping in East London), actually they are usually better than what I get from my BT wired broadband over wifi. Fogg mobile gives you 250 MB data per month free for 2 years, which is only enough to use in an emergency when nothing else is available. I will generally stick to wifi and tethering, but it is a good option to have and the sim is swappable, so you can easily get an unlimited mobile data SIM card from Three for around \u00a315 per month which should give you constant internet coverage without having to use wifi or tethering. The only problem I have with Three is that they don\u2019t always have their own masts, so when you head to central london you have to make do with the very low bandwidth that they manage to rent from other providers and at peak times that is nonexistent in places like the city. Still, you can insert a sim from any provider if they have better service in your area.I tested HSPA+ vs BT broadband speed in Wapping at 5.30 PM with no one else connected to the wifi network. Streaming speeds were 6537 kbps on three\u2019s mobile network, almost twice of what is minimally recommended for HD video streaming. ON BT wifi I got 9837 kbps, which is around 50 percent higher but in real world use both connection speeds are fine.Battery LifeI had no chance to test this yet, at the moment I am at 90 percent charge and the machine estimates 7.5 hours of charge left, which seems to fall in line with what most people get. I\u2019d say 8 hours is a reasonable expectation from this machine, but this will go down steeply if you stream HD videos. As for heat, the bottom of the machine is completely cool to the touch and it seems you don\u2019t get the annoying spinning up of the fans that you get from windows laptops and macbooks when you tax the CPU. The Haswell microarchitecture really shines here.ConclusionOverall I am happy with my purchase, the HP Chromebook 14 is a significant step up from the Samsung series 3. What you gain in screen size, performance, quality and looks you lose in portability and weight, so you have to examine your usage scenarios to see if this is the right machine for you. My feeling is that for the time being this is the Macbook Pro of budget chromebooks. It is heavier and more expensive than the Acer C720 or or the Samsung, but it will serve you better as a desktop replacement and it is more suitable as a workspace. Built in mobile internet is also a huge plus in my eyes as unlimited data plans are becoming more common in the UK, so you could conceivably use this machine without ever needing to connect to wifi, therefore saving yourself a bunch on a wired broadband subscription. I think that the HP14 offers real value for money, particularly in the UK where laptops are significantly more expensive than in the US even if you factor in the 20% VAT. To give you an idea about the value proposition, the 3G model costs \u00a3279 whilst the Wifi only model is priced at \u00a3250 at the online UK HP store. To find a windows laptop that has comparable specs and build quality, you would have to pay at least twice as much, with apple you will have to pay 3-4 times as much. When it comes to chromebooks, the ACER C720 and the Samsung both cost \u00a3180 at PC World if you factor in the \u00a320 cashback offer, but both have only 2 GB of ram. For the added quality and screen size, I think \u00a370 is a reasonable price to pay if portability and weight isn\u2019t paramount. It is also worth keeping an eye on special voucher codes, I managed to buy this model at a 10 percent discount, so I paid only \u00a3251 for it, there might be similar offers in the future.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Coral Peach: Because, Damn it!", "Author": "Tiger \"Tigercaron\"", "ReviewID": "R2OGQT0N4Z9XW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well yes! I made fun of the new HP Chromebook 14 (in Coral Peach, Turquoise and Snow White) when I first saw it.

There is no wait time for booting up, just open it up and the chromebook starts up.  Moving to different websites is so fast!  Rarely is there problem opening any site - once a site was very slow opening and I got a message on the chromebook asking if I wanted to wait or to kill it. I chose kill it, and I got a screen with a sad face and text saying 'It's dead, Jim\".  That cracked me up! I really love seeing personality put into technology!  The only things I'm not up to par with yet are the photos.  You upload them to the computer where they are stored onto the cloud.  If you want to print or send one, you need to download to your chromebook to do so.  It's not hard, it's just that it takes me a little time to figure out how to do that.

The ONLY thing I have not been able to do download is iTunes and hook up my ipod to the chromebook. But my ipod has wifi access, so that's not really a problem either.

Great for internet but not much else!", "Author": "Tim Mahaney", "ReviewID": "R2H3D41BSKPCFA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this device mainly because the retail price was very low compared to competitors and the device looked attractive and had a nice feel when playing with a demo model. Plus, I already used some key Google services (Chrome, Gmail and Calendar) so I thought it might be worth a shot to see how they operated on Chrome OS since in my experience software generally runs best on it\u2019s native OS if created by the same developer (i.e. iTunes on Mac OS X and Microsoft Office on Windows). I've had this Chromebook for a week now and have had the opportunity to test it as thoroughly as I can based on the things I use laptops for. Below are the observations I made while using it and I separated everything into categories for quicker viewing depending on your needs. Before I get started I want to emphasize that you should use the Get Started app that Google provides and/or do searches online if you get stumped. If you don\u2019t, then you will get frustrated and just want to get rid of it. A few times I said this OS sucked but after researching it I was able to figure out how to accomplish my task at hand by reading directions, imagine that!Media Files: On day one I tested it by watching numerous mp4 files I had stored on an SD card. I popped the card in (which does not stick out from the side of the machine) and the file browser popped up. I double clicked the m4v file and the media player that is built into the OS started playing the file. I also tried some music files I had stored on a USB drive and it worked the same way with the file browser opening up and the built in player launching upon double clicking the file. I have my music collection encoding using iTunes so they are AAC m4a files, which confirms Google\u2019s claims that these file types are supported. iTunes users should feel comfortable migrating to this environment. See this page for other supported media types: [...]Microsoft Office: It appears that Google is trying to cover all their bases with \"basic\" tasks by including Google Docs, Spreadsheets and Slides as Microsoft Office alternatives and with a little time learning the interfaces you should be able to do all the basic functions in these apps. There is also an offline option to work on your files without an internet connection which worked fine but I quickly found out that documents can be edited but spreadsheets are \u201cview only\u201d when offline. This is something that Google needs to work on ASAP because if I didn\u2019t have a mobile hotspot this alone would be reason enough for me to return/sell it. So, if you don\u2019t always have an internet connection and use spreadsheets a lot then this device and OS is not for you. I also installed SkyDrive which allowed me to edit Microsoft files in their web-apps, which look like the paid software versions but within a web browser. They too have limited functionality like the Google apps but you would be able to find things quicker if you are used to those user interfaces but you do lose the offline editing capabilities that Google provides you through their alternatives (though they aren\u2019t perfect as I already mentioned). Google Keep is also offered and it is like Notes in Mac OS X or Notepad in Windows so you do have something for quick note taking and this works perfectly offline. I don\u2019t use slide presentations so I can\u2019t comment on that program.Apps: I feel a lot of these are unnecessary because most of the ones I've installed simply direct you straight to the homepage of that website just as if you clicked one of your bookmarks in your Bookmarks Bar. One advantage I see to this though as I used it more is that you can pin more of these apps to your Launcher Bar at the bottom of the screen than you could install on the Bookmarks Bar in your Chrome browser window. The apps also allow you to open them in a separate window which is nice if you don't want it to open in another browser tab and/or cluttering up the Chrome browser. Also, hardly any of them are redesigned in any way like you are used to seeing apps on smart phones. The ones that were built differently I felt just didn't work as well as the full site so I just ended up typing the internet address in the Chrome browser and removed the app. One thing that I liked that are present in Google apps on other OS\u2019s that I saw was missing here was the speech input. On iPad I like speaking things I want to search for and that wasn\u2019t an option in the Google Chrome or Google Search apps on this machine. I do see a microphone above the screen so I know it\u2019s capable of hearing my voice, so hopefully this is something they add soon.Hardware: The build quality of this machine is one of the best I've seen at this price point! I find it visually appealing with the selection of colors they used (my model was silver/white) and the keyboard tray reminds me of a Mac wireless keyboard. This color combination also makes it impossible to see fingerprints. The soft touch material being used for the outer body of this laptop feels nice to the hands. It can take a beating too apparently because I already bumped it against something pretty hard by accident and it didn\u2019t show a mark at all! Nice job HP! This device is also very thin and is competing with ultrabooks in terms of size, in fact it looks almost identical to the sleekbook/ultrabook offerings from HP. The device also has a nice selection of ports providing USB 2.0, USB 3.0, full size HDMI, SD card reader, headphone/microphone combo jack, Kensington lock slot and an indicator light for sleep/use.Screen: I did notice while watching videos that I had to adjust the screen angle a couple of times to get the perfect viewing angle (mostly for dark blacks). Clearly this is not an IPS display, but for $300 I guess you can't expect to get a 1080p IPS display. It feels very solid and doesn\u2019t flex very much when I tried to bend the screen from side-to-side. The screen is also very thin and after applying pressure to the back of the panel to see if it would show through I glad to say nothing showed unless you were applying A LOT of pressure, which I\u2019m sure most users won\u2019t. I was a little disappointed to see that the backlit chrome bar present on the lid of HP 11 and Pixel was missing here. I think adding this would make a nice additional design element.Keyboard: It doesn't have much key travel but if you can train yourself to type softer then you should be able to adjust and make it a good typing experience (with devices becoming thinner this is just something we will have to make adjustments for). Also, the keyboard tray is solid and does not flex or trampoline at all. Some back-lit keys would be a nice addition in future models since ambient lighting isn't the greatest in most rooms I\u2019ve used this in but the grey lettering on white keys helps to combat that a little bit. I love most of the shortcuts at the top of the keyboard such as the full screen, volume adjustments and display brightness keys but the back/forward aren't necessary with trackpad gestures and anyone used to using alt+tab to switch through apps won\u2019t use the app switching key. I feel one, if not all, of these could be removed and shift the row left so we can have a dedicated DELETE key (holding alt+backspace isn\u2019t quite as intuitive for people coming from Windows). See this site for keyboard shortcuts: [...]Trackpad: I was shocked at how the trackpad had a silky smooth texture to it which reminded me of a Macbook because my finger rarely skips across the surface. I love the addition of trackpad gestures and use tap-to-click, back/forward and scrolling all the time. The clickpad is only clickable on the bottom half of the trackpad and gets easier to push down the closer to the bottom of the trackpad you get. A full clickpad might be a nice change in future models.Hinge: The hinge to open the lid isn't as stiff as you find on 90% of laptops today which require two hands to pry open, however you still can't open it with one hand. Hopefully with more use the hinge will loosen a little more since one unit I tested in a store before I made the purchase seemed to be a little looser than the one on my unit. I personally love laptops that you don't have to pry open with two hands and this is about halfway there. I think if they put the hinge from the HP Chromebook 11 on this then they would have nailed it. I also decided to grab the laptop by the lid and shook it around to test how strong the hinge was and it didn\u2019t give very much at all so I\u2019m confident that it\u2019s a solid build and won\u2019t break anytime soon if ever.Accessories: I like that the power adapter is smaller than we are used to seeing with traditional laptops but at the same time I feel power bricks have become outdated and need to be more like tablet chargers having folding prongs built in to a cube shaped adapter versus having a cord going in and coming out of a power brick.Performance: So far from my testing the performance has been great. I wouldn\u2019t think that using an Intel Celeron laptop would be something that I would brag about but I haven\u2019t had any issues with things getting hung up or freezing. I\u2019m not even sure why Google made the Pixel with an i5 processor because after using this I really don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s necessary (unless it\u2019s for gaming which is something I don\u2019t do on laptops). Web pages load pretty fast on my home network which is running on an ac router and I don\u2019t experience any lag as I scroll down from loading images. Refreshing the laptop internals to have wireless ac built-in would be a nice addition in future models.Battery: Installed is a 4 cell battery and checking the HP website results in a 9.5 hour claim. After using it for a week and monitoring usage very closely here is what I found. I was able to get 4 days of use out of it before having to plug it in and combined use time was 7 hours. However, 1.75 hours of this was watching videos so battery life could have been better if just used for web browsing and document editing only. In fact, looking at my results and doing some simple math, I\u2019m confident 9.5 hours is an accurate claim. For once HP isn\u2019t exaggerating battery life claims! The Intel Celeron processor doesn\u2019t appear to be built for extended video playback though because after watching 1.75 hours of files from a USB drive I lost 30%! So, doing the math this machine should be able to last close to 6 hours for viewing back-to-back movies if you are on a long car ride or flight. Not that impressive when compared to tablets but having files stored internally might produce better results. All these findings were obtained with active wi-fi and brightness set to 50% the whole time. Using the sleep feature by closing the lid or using the \u201cshut down\u201d feature in the bottom right of the screen or holding the power button seemed to produce the same drainage result. I found that after a combined sleep time of 75 hours I only lost 5% of battery life. I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty impressive compared to Windows machines and leaves more battery for use! Charging time from 5% took exactly 2 hours to fully charge back to 100% which is great since my cell phone charges about that quick and I consider that to be the industry standard.Conclusion: Overall I am pleased with the device but $300 might still be a little high for something that only serves as an internet browsing machine since the spreadsheet editing isn\u2019t where I\u2019d like it to be for offline use. I will probably let this device go for sale on eBay though because I don\u2019t need a third internet browsing device in my house. It simply doesn\u2019t outperform my iPad because the iWorks suite has more offline functionality on-the-go and the battery life of this machine comes up a little short. For fully functional software I will continue to rely on my home PC. HP should allow add-ons or upgrades on their website for a backlit keyboard, wireless ac, IPS display and a tablet adapter (if they can develop one). As for Chrome OS, add the option of editing spreadsheets offline and I\u2019ll give your OS another shot.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Chomebooks are the way to go", "Author": "Bill Cook", "ReviewID": "R1PBLBNISV0XOD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good solid performing machine.

I have decades worth of research to compile and incorporate so it made sense that I needed a computer compatible with my Microsoft word files. WRONG!  That machine was a true pain.  It kept crashing.  Knocked me off the internet.  Had to reload data, etc. etc.  After 8 hours of trying to get it to work for me and my needs, I gave up.  I downloaded some word files from Windows XP onto a thumb drive and headed back to Office Depot to return the HP Windows 8.1 machine.

I already have a thin and light laptop that I use for travel.  I love it, but the screen isn't the greatest and the battery life is just a tiny bit short and the fan (which runs all the time) is a bit too loud.  I figured for this kind of price I'd try something that's essentially similar, but maybe just a little bit better in some of these areas.  If it didn't work out, well, it didn't cost much and I don't mind having a spare machine.Well, it is just a bit better than the other machine.  The screen's the same resolution but a bit brighter and crisper and a bit less limited in its viewing angles.  The battery life is distinctly better.  The fan noise is still there (this is not a silent machine) but a bit quieter.  Keyboard etc. are comparable.  The one thing that's *very* different is the amazing speed with which it comes up.  Open the lid and boom, everything's there.  It's a startling contrast to any Windows/Linux/Mac laptop I've ever used.  Basically the only time I've turned on the other computer since the Chromebook arrived was to get some data off it.  The cheaper machine is winning, hands down.  That's about one third the price of what it effectively replaces, and that in turn was 30% cheaper than direct alternatives.The only downsides have to do with ChromeOS.  It works for what it does, and extra apps help, but there are gaps.  As a developer who works from home, the lack of a decent ssh client is a bit of a problem.  The absolutely laughable state of the VPN support - as far as I know nobody has ever gotten it working with any VPN server that wasn't specially configured to accommodate it - is likely to affect more than just developers.  Almost everyone else I know has flipped their Chromebook into developer mode and installed some other operating system, but I'm sticking with it because I have other machines I use for work.  If anybody's planning to use ChromeOS as a *primary* desktop environment, I'd recommend against it.

It is light and easy to carry. I purchased a padded cover which was sufficient to protect the laptop in trips to a coffee shop or on the road in a larger purse or bag.2. It does the basics well. I set up gmail, facebook and chrome for browsing and my non-technical, not-a-computer-person mom took to it right away once I gave her a quick demo.3. For older people or non-techies who do just Facebook and Internet, it's ideal. I haven't had any calls from my mom since she started on this laptop. She's on Gmail, facebook and internet. She can order things online and watch Netflix just fine.4. It has enough USB ports and connectors to do just about anything you need, like upload pics, watch the screen on a TV or save documents to a thumb drive.What's not so great:1. I couldn't work in Google Docs offline (something I do often in Windows and Word). That make me wonder how so many people say they are using this as a business/work laptop. It wouldn't work for me at all. I am not a fan of Google docs (probably since I have used Word for so long) but no offline document creation. That could be a deal breaker.2. Doesn't automatically connect to a printer.  You have to connect to Google Cloud Printer either a \"Cloud Ready\" printer or set up printing from a _different_ computer (PC or Mac) using Chrome to enable a \"classic printer\" to connect to Google Cloud Printer so the Chromebook can then print.  My mom will NEVER figure this one out. I find it an awkward solution when normally you can connect any laptop to a printer to print.3. I found connecting with the wireless network to be a bit buggy and not the instant connection I expected. It did get it to work and it seemed to stay connected without issues. I am not sure my mom could connect to a network as it wasn't THAT intuitive.4. I was underwhelmed by the selection of Chromebook apps available. It's a good basic list, but after using android apps on my tablets and phones, Chromebook apps seemed very limited in choices.Overall, I like the Chromebook as a glorified tablet for Internet, watching videos and email. And for people who just need a basic laptop without any bells and whistles, but that turns on and goes, this is a great option.

Just as an NYC apartment might be located directly over a popular bar, or across from a parking garage, or next to crazy neighbors, or not have heat etc. -- HP laptops are *always* undone by some seemingly arbitrary design error that makes you not like them.  (By comparison, the faults of Apple systems, annoying as they are, are usually interpretable from some marketing perspective.)The HP chromebook 14 goes one better, sporting TWO fatal flaws.  The first is the CPU fan.  It's always on, and emits a maddening high-pitched whine through the bottom speaker grills, which I guess also function as heat vents.  Users whose hearing isn't sensitive to higher registers will find themselves untroubled.  The rest will live in a constant state of irritable tension as they chrome-browse the net.  This could have been so easily fixed early on in prototyping, but no, nobody at HP thought it worth the effort.The second fault is the screen.  Yes, it's 14 inches, awesome.  But it must be the cheapest, crappiest, darkest, most reflective, least visual-angle-y display on the market.Many will say: yes, true, the screen blows and the fan screeches.
