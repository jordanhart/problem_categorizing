With the new 25w mobile cpu (P8400 in my case) it runs cool enough to not need an additional platform cooler while on your lap (it doesn't blow hot air either).  From the first reports they must have repositioned the Thinklight because my doesn't blind me (it's inside the bezel more now I think).  You might want to download the additional Keyboard Customizer program from Lenovo to disable the forward and back web keys that are next to the Up arrow.  I kept pressing them by mistake and causing all kinds of problems.Pros: Thinklight. pointer mouse (hate those aweful touchpads! disabled mine). thin and light. Great battery life even with just 6 cell.  Single latch switch. Cool running cpu. Bought through Ebay (ellan_mouse) for only $750 after 10% ebay discount with no tax or shipping charges (now that's a deal!). Keyboard feels the same (not flexy like other reports). XP Pro still available.Cons: Screen off to the right, widescreen (I like tall more than wide), lcd screen not the brightest and bad off angle viewing (might be good for security and keeping peepers away though). Had to install program to disable keyboard buttons (forward/back web page buttons).  Speakers sound tiny. I don't know if it's my Airlink 150N router but I'm only getting 72Mb top speed from its 5100N wireless. Not as easy to add memory as older units (must remove keyboard bezel now).Seems like a lot of Cons but at this price I am not complaining.  I have a huge home system so my T400 is just a stripped down unit with XP Pro (not whista), only 1 gb of memory (everything running uses less than 700 Mb), intel video, dvd only reader (I use flash drives and only burn dvds on my home unit).  Didn't make sense to pay another $300 for options (video, burner) that my home unit can do better and faster.  I still use the T400 way more at home for doing most things.  I just got the T400 so I don't know if it will last as long as my old T22 has (still running when I sold it) but I hope so!  It may not be the prettiest unit but it's light, fast, cheap and practical for the discriminating user.", "Date": "November 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "The best laptop I have ever used.", "Author": "Gong Cheng", "ReviewID": "R1S73E5RUJSDAT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The battery life is long 6.5 hour with surprising low heat.

M.", "ReviewID": "R2VBJLI1YWIPLG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you want a performance laptop with durability and reliability, look no more. ThinkPads have been the top of the line laptops for IBM and now Lenovo. I bought this for half the price of what a MacBook Pro costs and performed some easy installation upgrades such as Solid State drive and 8GB of Ram. With a Macbook you have to do a bit more work just to perform these tedious upgrades (Apple doesn't like it when you open up their products).This Laptop is lightning fast, the keyboard is a joy to type on, speakers are great, webcam view is clear and the very cool thing about this laptop is the Ultra bay hot swap. If you don't use the CD/DVD recordable drive as much, you can easily eject it by pressing the Ultra bay eject tab and insert an additional battery or an extra hard drive for backups. This feature is very very cool and you can't do that on a MacBook Pro!Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit runs flawlessly (thanks to Microsoft)and by far is the best Windows version Microsoft has ever built. The BitLocker encryption is a plus which allows you to encrypt USB, SD cards, folders, files or the hard drive itself for extra protection. But if you want security, this laptop has another cool feature..it has an accurate fingerprint reader that allows you to associate any finger with your password(s). In other words, no more typing passwords to log into Windows. When you boot up your laptop, it prompts you to swipe your finger and presto! Without the finger swipe, no thief or intruder can wipe or access or remove your hard drive without that finger print. You can't do that on a Macbook Pro!!Finally, I love the so called rollcage technology (durable frame inside)that guards it from those accidental drops. It also has a cool drain technology for those accidental spills...you can't do that on Macbook Pro!So do yourself a favor, if want want more bang for your buck with all these extra goodies and performance, get a ThinkPad! I also highly recommend uninstalling any Lenovo software you may not want to use just to free up some space. I only use Lenovo update software, Fingerprint and Power Manager.  Those are all you need!$1600 for top of the line ThinkPad with goodies vs. $2200 for a Macbook Pro (without SSD or 8GB Ram)....the choice is obvious!", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good deal + Good refurbished laptop + Good customer service", "Author": "Sony Tran", "ReviewID": "R2MHRX8NNZDP5F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this ThinkPad T400 on Friday night and I received the laptop at 2:00pm on the next following Tuesday.

I have been using this laptop for over 6 months and I am enjoying using it everyday. My job demands typing a lot and the keypad in this laptop series is very good. Some people say they have issues with the pointer mouse wherein it obstructs while typing - I never had this issue so far. I have a Core 2 Duo processor with XP and the processor seems to be responding faster than the ones that have Windows 7 with i3. Please read the complete specifications before buying -check if the laptop has support for all types of peripheral devices - USB3, HDMI, Video, Ethernet cable pulgin, Card Reader, Bluetooth. Incase you prefer more stylish, you can choose the new T series which is really good - keypads and touchpads are breathtaking. System has rebooted 2/3 times so far due to unknown fatal errors but no data errors have occured so far - I keep regularly updating patches and add ons and have not come across major issues. Battery life is ok when compatred with other makers and most improtantly there is no noise and more heat genereated from it - The best thing which I love in these laptops", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Price, Great Laptop", "Author": "greenknight", "ReviewID": "R2AWMHK541JDQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The refurbished Thinkpad I received from Tampa Laptops wasn't the 7417 listed, it was a 6478 - very similar model, but it has only 3 USB ports instead of 4, and a 4 cell battery rather than a 6 cell. It also has a 160 GB HDD instead of 80 GB, so I'm more than happy with the substitution. I expected the battery would be weak, but it still had more than 86% of its capacity so it will be good for a while. I was planning to upgrade the HDD, but now I don't need to, and I've never needed 4 USB ports - so it's all good.It was shipped very promptly, and was well packed with 3 layers of bubble wrap for protection. It's in excellent condition, everything works fine. I have nothing but praise for the vendor.These Thinkpad T400s are really nice. Good solid metal case with strong metal hinges - the screen stays at the angle you put it. I has good wide viewing angles side-to-side, less so up-and-down, and the image is very crisp. The keyboard is great, I wish I had one as nice on my desktop. It never gets hot - if it's really pushed hard, noticeably warm air blows out of the vents, but nothing uncomfortably hot. Easy to work on, too - if I decide to add more RAM just need to take off the palm rest, held on by 4 screws, to get at it. The optical drive pops out and can be hot-swapped with other accessories - even another HD.I love this thing.

The machine's battery does not hold its charge like I thought it would. This is no discredit to the seller, however.  And do keep in mind that this is a refurbished model. Although, shouldn't they work a little better than this?The reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5, is : Although I do love the size and shape of the keys, when typing, the cursor jumps up to a previous line every second or third sentence unless you type extremely slow. And I mean slow.Then, there you are typing away when it isn't even on the sentence you were typing on.  I thought it might be the mouse pad, but I have been unable to find out how to disable it and use a Bluetooth mouse.Which brings up my second complaint...no manual anywhere. You would think that a laptop that is only two years old would have a manual somewhere online. I called Lenovo and a rep. said they didn't have one, and acted like I was putting him out by asking him to answer a couple of questions about it.  Too bad.

Yes 16 years this is how much it is reliable.My T400 was much better than I expected which I bought for 299 US. The anti-glare screen makes a huge difference for the comfort of the eyes. Also, mine has no camera which is very good for offshore trips and missions since laptops with cameras are forbidden. The keyboard is fantastic, comfy and easy to use the best I ever seen and used. My T400 came with Windows XP PRO which I like more than Windows 7. In terms of speed I think I got more than enough and its pretty fast. Battery is like 4 hours with normal internet usage which is better than any of my other laptops. Remember, its a used laptop!All in all it was the first time I think I had a steal bargain in amazon. The T400 is very solid and reliable. If it was possible to rate this as a 6 star out of 5 then I wont hesitate. Also see in youtube the military tests made on the thinkpads.
