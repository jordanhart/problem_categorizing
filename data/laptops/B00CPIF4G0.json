Works very well, touch screen works as advertised.  Screen display and keyboard are good.  The issue I have is that the memory is basically fixed at 2GB.  Early on I'd read that this was going to allow up to 8GB, which I assumed was user upgradeable.  This is not the case.  ASUS told me that the max is 4GB and that it can only be done at a service center.  \"On board\" memory is evidently soldered to the motherboard.In all honesty, so far, 2GB has been sufficient for the simple tasks this laptop is being used for (web browsing and occasional Office documents).", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great everyday workhorse.", "Author": "Patricia Gray", "ReviewID": "R3L3EZ73HHG8XY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going for a full 5 stars on this laptop, despite the limitations the product has in comparison to other laptops available on the market today. There are several apps that come pre-loaded on the laptop including Netflix, Bing search, paint, a pinball game, but it does not come with the Office Suite loaded, this will need to be a separate purchase. There are a couple of really good free word processors out there like LibreOffice that run very smoothly and have excellent features, not to mention Google Docs.The main and only real issue I have with the laptop is the inability, as another reviewer has mentioned, to upgrade the memory. It comes with 2GB and cannot be swapped out by the end user. I think being able to do so could make up for some speed issues elsewhere. 2GB isn't exactly the high end of the spectrum, but it can push what this laptop was designed for, and I'm okay to settle with that.While many users of Windows 8 had some issues with the layout and the functionality / familiarity of the operating system, I feel that the environment works well with this laptop. The touch screen works admirably and I have not had any issues with switching back and forth between using on screen commands and regular keyboard or mouse commands. The best way to describe the operating system is somewhere between a more traditional Windows environment and a smartphone. There is a desktop, with folders, time, and all the rest we are used to seeing, and there are also app-launcher screens that can be accessed and are laid out very similar to how the apps are arranged on a phone.There is sufficient hard drive space for movies, documents, and music, but it is on the slower end of hard drives. The only time this is noticeable is when programs are starting or documents are being retrieved. On the other hand, the lower speed of the hard drive is supposed to help battery life, so it's a fair trade off.There are plenty of ports on the laptop, and while I've seen others mention the lack of an optical drive (that is a DVD drive, fyi) I cannot imagine anything that I'd truly need an optical drive for. This machine is not meant to push serious computer games, and most software can be downloaded from the manufacturer if you're wanting software of the laptop. If you're still wanting one, however, $30 can get you a USB powered drive and the problem is solved.The laptop is designed for everyday use, but not by superusers or those with unrealistic expectations of how a laptop should function. You will need to be patient upon set up, which takes about 5 - 10 minutes, and the laptop itself is a bit on the slower side. This however, is to be expected with the onboard hardware, and for the price and components, this is an excellent laptop if you're just needing word documents, spreadsheets, pictures, videos, music, and general web browsing.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for everyday use.

Windows 8 comes on this laptop. Like all the windows 8 computers, it comes without having a start button in desktop mode.

I prefer to choose the Avast free personal antivirus program, and it recognized the tablet immediately, and downloaded quickly.Intel Celeron 1007U (1.5GHz) processor is okay.

Kwashnak \"voracious reader\"", "ReviewID": "RYYC03J0211CG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The hot trend in terms of Windows Laptops is Windows 8 and touch screens. The Asus VivoBook X200CA is one such foray into the market, but it is one that is lacking. It is not as much a laptop than it is a touch screen enabled Windows 8 netbook - that class of small, lightweight and unfortunately underpowered machines that emphasize portability and battery life over power. While a fun experiment and a great way to get your feet wet with Windows 8 and a touch screen, the machine comes up lacking for any real regular use.As I am writing this, I am running the machine with the default McAfee security program and Open Office, and I'm currently using 75% of my memory. Part of that is that the system is downloading updates and the included McAfee is scanning it as it downloads but as someone who multi-tasks work, this is going to be a problem. The light memory (only 2 GB) and the beyond weak processor (a Pentium Celeron 1.5 Ghz) prevents this machine from living up to potential. Unfortunately, laptops need a bit more oomph, because unless you leave it on or you use it every day, when you boot the laptop, you need to compete with updates and downloads before you can get started on your work. Which is too bad because otherwise there is a lot of potential here. Sleek and lightweight, the machine weighs in a very light 2.6 lbs. with a bright 11.6 inch touch screen. It is built for portability - there is no optical drive but the machine boasts two USB 2.0 ports on one side and a USB 3.0 port on the other side. Video has both a VGA and an HDMI output on the left hand side to give options to hook up to a larger display. Networking is either the built in 801.11 bgn wireless, but also has a sleek expanding Ethernet port for wired networking if needed. The hard drive is a decent 320 GB, which is probably going to be much more space than you need for this type of machine, unless you use this as a portable movie media device and download a lot of files (since you do not have an included optical drive to watch from)The keyboard is fairly nice to type on featuring a well laid out collection of keys for the size of the keyboard, with the keys the raised Chiclet style that give nicely under the fingers for tactile typing, as well as an on-screen keyboard for touch screen use. At the bottom of the screen is a rather large trackpad that is set up for multi-touch gestures, allowing the user to navigate through programs and the Windows 8 screens with multi-finger gestures. The gestures take some getting used to but overall they can be used for a speedy response without having to move from the keyboard to the screen and back.The warranty and battery life are not bad at one year, and a reported 5 hours of life. Unfortunately, the battery seems to be inside the body which means that it is not easily replaceable, nor is it possible to get a longer lived battery.Unfortunately in the end I have a very hard time getting past the lack of memory and power. I understand that is part of the reason the price is more in line with what we were paying for netbooks, but I have a hard time recommending this machine beyond as either an entry level laptop for year or so, or as a supplemental, very portable machine for on the go. Otherwise, if you are able, up your budget $200 and look for full powered notebooks with AMD or Intel's i3 or i5 line of processors and a decent amount of memory. In the end, you truly get what you pay for.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Affordable compact Windows 8 laptop if you want a touchscreen", "Author": "bsg2004", "ReviewID": "R3BDNFDB5W0Q7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The ASUS VivoBook X200CA-DB01T is a compact Windows 8 laptop with a touchscreen. It is best suited as a secondary computer, not as a primary computer (unless you mostly do email and lightweight web browsing). Having said that, and despite having only 2GB of main memory and a lightweight mobile processor, it performed better than expected with the default Balanced power plan. When you switch to the power saving plan, it starts to slow down. It has a 320GB hard disk, not the usual 500GB you find in many laptops.One of the decision points whether to get this is whether you want or need a touchscreen. Considering its $300 price (October 2013), this laptop may be an affordable way to test or experience Windows 8 in its full glory, with both the Metro touch interface and the classic Windows-D Explorer interface. On the other hand, if you don't care for touchscreens or Windows 8, one of the best values ever for a web browsing computer is the Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch)Because it is a small laptop, you can increase productivity by using a longer than average tablet stylus to point on the screen. Your hands won't have to travel far to hit the screen. The combination of a stylus and keyboard and touchpad may make some tasks fly faster than keyboard and touchpad only (for example, when you have to type and navigate all over the screen, eg forms and surveys).The laptop has a small footprint, it is a good match for small round tables you find in some coffee shops. It leaves enough room for your drink!Battery is on the low end. For example, in a real world scenario, at a coffee shop, with brightness high (so I can read the screen), browsing the web (half a dozen browser tabs) and playing music with Foobar, with the Balanced power plan, it ate up 50% of the battery in just over one hour. With lower brightness, it can probably go up to three hours. If you are going to need to use it for many hours without recharging, you may want to look elsewhere. On the plus side, its AC adapter is fairly compact, it is not the usual laptop AC brick. It looks more like a tablet AC adapter than a laptop AC adapter.It does not have Bluetooth. But there is a simple workaround: I used a cheap $1 Bluetooth USB dongle I had, and it worked just fine. The laptop has three USB slots. Plus, you can turn off Bluetooth permanently in this fashion by removing the USB dongle. I only put in the USB dongle when I want to use a Bluetooth device. Most of the time it is not on.It does not have an optical drive of any kind. You can attach one via USB. I did not need to use an optical drive and I don't have a USB optical drive at the moment.On the Left side (from back to front), it has the power input, VGA output, one USB 3.0 port, and HDMI out. On the Right side (back to front), it has the security lock, the Ethernet jack (partially recessed), two USB 2.0 ports, headphone input, and card reader.Keyboard: the letters (A-Z) are great, large and easy to hit. Some of the auxiliary keys are smaller and harder to get to (eg tiny Escape). But overall, considering the size and price, it is a very serviceable keyboard. The touchpad is larger than expected. For lack of a better word, the touchpad sometimes makes a clacking sound, a \"hollow\" type of sound. No functional problems but it got my attention. This other issue might be my own typing style, but when I try to hit the leftmost CTRL key, my thumb often touches the touchpad and activates the left-side Charms menu. Annoying but you can turn the Charms off and use keyboard shortcuts instead.There is apparently a known issue with some ASUS laptops. If you change the Power Plan and select \"do nothing\" option when you close the lid, when you open the lid again, the touchscreen may not work. Do not panic. The bug is that it turns off the touchscreen functionality when you close the lid but forgets to re-enable it when you open the lid. There is a simple but awkward solution when you Google it (resetting things in Device Manager). It happened to me, and after that, I changed the Power Plan to other options.The small hump at the bottom of the device, at the back (perhaps the battery), makes for a nice grip if you are moving the closed laptop from one place to another (eg from bag to desk).While in operation, it consistently heats up at the left side under the laptop, so make sure that area is not blocked by clothing or linen or other things that block air flow.The charging and status lights are on the keyboard part of the laptop, on the front right side, at the edge as it faces you. When the lid is closed, you kinda have to look under to see them. The colors are the usual green and red/orange.The cover is a fingerprint magnet. You might as well give up trying to clean it and just fill it with fingerprints so it looks uniform :)It fits inside the AmazonBasics 14-inch Laptop Sleeve with 0.75 inch to spare on each side and about 2 inches to spare on the front (where the zipper runs along).It has some pre-installed apps but the only non-ASUS bloatware that pesters is the 30 day McAfee free trial. The laptop includes Microsoft's own internet security software, but McAfee is by default the one running. You have to manually make adjustments if you don't like the status quo (don't forget that some of the major ISPs include standard internet security software for free while you are a subscriber).The laptop comes with Windows 8, but it is eligible for a free Windows 8.1 upgrade. Since I didn't previously make a System Image, I started with that. The estimate was 56GB, it took just under 50GB. Since it doesn't have an optical drive, I made the System Image on an external USB 2.0 hard drive. It took about 40 minutes to finish. It needs an NTFS drive for this purpose.The actual Windows 8.1 upgrade went smoothly, and it took nearly two hours. I did this using the Ethernet connection, not Wifi, since it is faster and more reliable. Around 40 minutes to download the software and prep the computer. Another 45 minutes of installations and multiple reboots. Then another 15 minutes of setting it up. You don't have to stare at the screen for 2 hours, but you have to check on it to see its progress. The upgrade will try to corner you into creating a Windows cloud account in order to login to your computer. Some may find this offensive for various reasons. If you don't want to do that, research this issue onlne and have the Steps to take/avoid handy on a separate computer/tablet/phone BEFORE you start the installation process. Both the installation and running of the computer after was pretty smooth with Windows 8.1.UNBOXING: it comes in a compact package, no wasted material. It includes the laptop, the AC adapter, and some paperwork (including a handy Getting Started guide). The laptop is wrapped in a thingy you can use as temporary protection until you find a case/bag/sleeve for it. The AC adapter is partially wrapped in see-through plastic, make sure you remove it before you plug it in! I almost missed it.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Quality Mini Laptop!!!", "Author": "Lee", "ReviewID": "RJBQOWZK32A7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I completely love the ASUS VivoBook laptop!  For quite a while now, I've wanted something small, yet versatile, for both personal and work business.  Not to mention something I can easily access my favorite websites or play games on, and this laptop fit the bill perfectly!  It comes packaged quite nicely with a small handle, and once you open the package there is only the laptop and the battery to charge it inside.  No mess, no fuss.  I did plug the battery to the left side port, and tried to charge it, but realized when the green light flashed that it came already pre-charged, which was great since I could dive right in and get to know my new laptop.  And before I begin with all the internal specs, let me say this is a very light mini laptop, which is great because I'm a tiny person who already lugs around a million things, and added weight is not all that fun.  It has a nice textured top, which is great, because I did have a previous large laptop that had a smooth finish, and I swear I had to wipe it down every day for tons of fingerprints.  So this is a definite plus.  The outside front does have a battery indicator that flashes red when it needs to be charged, green when it's ready for use.  The sides house an audio jack for plugging in your earbuds/earphones, a HDMI port, two USB ports, and a card reader.  Everything that I needed in one small package!  The power cord, does have a little Velcro strap, which I, personally, like as it keeps the wire tangle free.  The bottom of the laptop does have small rubber grips so it doesn't slide around on a smooth surface like a table top.Initially, when I started the Vivobook up, it does take quite a few minutes so be patient!  I want to say it took about 30 seconds for the screen to pop up where it ask you to personalize your screen (pick a screen color and pc name), add your email account, and enter your wireless information.  Wireless was a massive breeze, and it in less than three seconds it found my signal and I was ready to go!  You can choose express settings by the way, or you can customize your own.  While it updates your information and finalizes your settings the screen does display updates of what you can do with the laptop.It does have Windows 8 preinstalled on it as well as a month trial of McAfee security, so I do suggest going into the desktop app and click on the McAfee icon to do a scan and update the security before proceeding with setting up the rest of your information.  Windows 8 has a lot of apps already preinstalled on the home screen with things such as Skype, Netflix, Microsoft Messaging, Email, News, Pictures, etc.  All of these can be easily uninstalled by simply touching the app and pulling it down slightly.  A screen will appear at the bottom, and you can click uninstall the app.  This is actually my first interaction with Windows 8, and it fits this laptop perfectly for what the majority of people will want to do on it.  You can swipe from any edge to open the system tabs, and change your settings.  Also one I signed in using my email account it did sync everything in my calendar, which was very nice!!  There is a tutorial for Windows 8 on the home screen for all those who have yet to really mess with it.  There is also a camera in the laptop, which is great when you want to talk to people, or take pictures.  All you do is press the screen to take a picture, and you can easily view it on the apps!As for the inside of the laptop, the keys are very noise free, easy to press, and it feels like I'm typing on a normal keyboard.  The touchpad works like a charm, but since this is a touch screen laptop, I don't really see many people using it.  The touchscreen is very sensitive, and one little press will open windows, play games, etc!  I've typed using the touchscreen, and I've actually put the laptop on my lap at an angle, and it was such a breeze to type on the screen versus using the keyboard.  Overall this is a perfect laptop for people on the go, those in school, those working, or for those people who just want the ease of having all their favorite things at their fingertips.  My first time using the laptop, I will say my battery died at about two hours of use, but the screen was on constantly as it had 19 updates to install.  That actually took the longest portion of time.  Another feature I liked is that the screen will shut itself off, just like normal, but with a simple press of a button it comes back on in an instant, so the startup time is pretty good when it's in sleep mode.  Great laptop, perfect for what I needed, and I do recommend it as one of the best mini laptops out there!", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Small and portable for college students...", "Author": "Footprints", "ReviewID": "R190ALBIVX251I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a very small and lightweight laptop. It fits in my backpack, so it's easy to travel with. The battery is not removable, and lasts around the advertised time of 3-4 hours. I was able to make it last around 5 hours by turning Wi-Fi off, power-saving settings on, and decreasing the brightness of the screen. It starts up pretty fast and wakes almost instantly from sleep mode, which is convenient when working on projects.It runs Windows 8 and is equipped with a touchscreen to better take advantage of it. I use the touchscreen mainly for browsing the internet, but I've found the track-pad easier with the majority of programs I use. (Most of them are not developed or optimized for Windows 8.) The touchscreen works well with the applications that were designed to work with it, especially Google chrome and Internet Explorer. It's usually responsive, unless Windows 8 has something running in the background (it seems to like to run maintenance, or updates, when I'm trying to work, I usually just cancel, or kill the process).The track-pad works well, and software is included to allow you to use gestures to control different functions. Swiping from the corners allows you to switch from different Windows 8 applications, check the status of the computer, and access the start menu and options. You can also tap with two fingers to right click, as well as touch, hold, and drag with 2 fingers to scroll. I have found this to be really convenient and useful. My only small gripe is that it can sometimes take a while for this functionality to be activated on the track pad because it has to start up every time you use the laptop.This laptop doesn't have a CD-Rom drive, but I rarely use one anyway so it's not critical for me. It has 3 USB ports, 2 look like regular 2.0 ports, but there's a blue USB 3.0 port on the left side. It also has an audio jack, SD memory card reader, a Kensington security slot, a LAN port, and a VGA and HDMI port. It also comes with a camera, 0.9 megapixel, and microphone. They are ok, suitable for video conferencing programs like Skype, though I haven't used them much at all yet.It has enough power for web browsing and projects, but I wouldn't recommend it for any mid to high-end gaming, or graphically intensive video or photo editing programs. I have tested games like Minecraft, and Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, and they ran surprisingly well. However, I use it for basic college work, and it suits the job perfectly.I haven't found any big problems or flaws with this laptop so far, and it has been very convenient and useful alternative to my desktop computer.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT WORK MACHINE!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R8WUTTDO9OMSF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this little laptop!!

So you have to be sure to start storing all your data there or the C drive gets filled fast. But your default media libraries are on the C drive. I called Asus tech service. There is no way to de-partition except with 3rd party software.The computer does get hot and of course battery life is not ultrabook. I am getting roughly 3.5 hrs or so, at best 4.

The RAM is soldered down so not upgradeable and unlike most laptops, upgrading the HDD is a pain - no single screw panel, you have to take the whole base off to access anything. It's built more like an old netbook, for cost saving no doubt.However, there is a partial workaround for the perf - readyboost is still in Windows 8 so plugging in a USB memory stick (at least 4G) and enabling readyboost through the properties has made a noticeable improvement, still not perfect but at least it's useable now.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Definitely would not recommend", "Author": "ashley dendy", "ReviewID": "R23TWSWAF4XDZG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have genuinely never been disappointed in a product more than I am this netbook I recently purchased by Asus.

The battery ceases to charge properly, and simply says 'plugged in, not charging', while discharging even if I do not unplug the AC adapter. I have sent it in to have it repaired by Asus twice, and am currently making preparations to send it in for the third time, because I have no other option. I have contacted support for the third time, and they were almost wholly unhelpful, offering only to do the same repair again that has failed to fix the problem for any significant amount of time before. When asked who I could speak to about potentially getting the machine replaced instead, I was told that wasn't an option unless the store I purchased it from was willing to replace it (it was purchased from a Best Buy, which has a 15 day return/refund policy. A policy which expired while the computer was in for repairs the first time. I never had an opportunity to return it for a refund, because I was under the impression that repairing it would fix the issue. It did not.)I am incredibly disappointed in both the netbook I purchased and the service I have received from Asus, and I absolutely do not recommend them to anyone interested in a netbook or laptop, especially if it is for purposes such as school or work.

As far as the machine, It has a pretty good little touch screen that works as well or better than any smart phone that I have ever used but the mouse touch pad is next to useless IMO. It takes a fair amount more pressure than my ten year old Dell Inspiron does to make the mouse move and the \"pop ups\" (not internet pop ups) but the windows 8 interface popups are triggered inadvertently when you don't want them to. I have had a hard  time just getting it to stay on the application you want it too when using the mouse so you are almost forced to use the touchscreen if you want any amount of control over what you are doing.

I wanted a small computer that I could grab-n-go for meetings, presentations and basic Office tasks away from my home or business office. I already had a 15.6-inch notebook but it is too heavy and bulky for the flexibility this size machine offers.I already have an Android tablet that still works fine so I did not want to replace it ir merely duplicate its function. I examined my options carefully and lengthily (\"decide in haste, repent in leisure\") and looked long and hard at the Surface series and the Asus T100 Transformer series; the former offers keyboards for extra money, the later has a KB included for much less total price. There are other similar devices by HP and Lenovo, for example, but they are very costly for what would be, for me, a convenience machine rather than a primary work station.The 10.6-inch Surface and T100 both had MS Office included, full license not trial version. The 11.6-inch Asus offers only the trial version. I could not find any machine by any maker in 11.6 that included full MS Office. Nonetheless, I went with 11.6 for two main reasons:1. It is an actual computer with 4 GB memory (vs only 2 for the 10.6 tablets) and a 500GB HD, vs 32-128 for the tablets, depending on price.  500GB is actually a lot more than I need, but the cost for this Asus versus the 64GB versions of the tablets was considerably less.2. The 11.6-size keyboard is much more usable than the 10.6's devices. Asus says that the X200's keyboard is 91 percent of full size. I find no difference that matters in utility between it and my desktop keyboard - not only because of the size but because its key and layout and tactile response are outstanding. Using the 10.6 keyboards felt cramped.Despite having only a Celeron processor, this Asus is plenty fast for me. Much of that has to do with the hardware architecture and the OS, which are far superior to Win7 devices. The Asus features instant on from sleep and it works great. Also, when the screen and keyboard are closed, there is almost zero battery usage, which is a great thing because my main complaint is the battery.The battery does not last very long, certainly compared to a tablet, and it is not user replaceable, which was almost a deal breaker for me. I understand that permanent batteries are routine in tablets, but doggone it, this Asus is marketed as, and is, a notebook computer, not a tablet, and should have a replaceable battery. (Whether is is replaceable at a service department I do not know.)Screen size and clarity: Outstanding. I have no complaints. The picture quality is better than my 15.6 HP (which is four years old).Weight: Yep, noticeably heavier than the 10.6 tablet equivalents,. which is expected. I wish it was lighter, but understand the trade offs of size vs weight.Touchscreen: This was a key factor in my decision. Had this machine not been touch screen - and many of its peer-size machines are not - then I would have passed it by.Mousepad: I'll give it a B-plus. But I loathe mousepads generally. I use the touchscreen every chance I get.Win 8.1 upgrade: Can be done only through the Windows Store, which is quite okay, but before you can upgrade to 8.1 you must install all the 8.0 native upgrades. Not really a problem just, takes a little time.First-time power on and setup: As always, don't let it default but select custom and control each step. I was surprised that there was not a lot of bloatware.MS Office: I have not activated the trial version and probably will not. I use MS Onedrive (formerly called Skydrive) to sync and store all my work files and I have MS Office on my home and work computers. On this Asus I installed Libre Office (free) and it works fine for my purposes. Also, Onedrive includes online editing of MS Office files, though without the full functionality of the desktop software. But I don't use all those features anyway, so when connected to the Internet, Onedrive's online editor fills the bill.Ports: just as useful as a large notebook. A USB 3 port is included and it is a lot faster than the two USB 2 ports. There is a full-size HDMI outlet, a VGA port, an ethernet port, full-size SD Card slot, security lock port and a combined headphone/microphone port. No optical drive.Summary: Glad I bought it and it works great for my purposes.

This piece of junk they have released in the market, however, has made me swear off the brand for good. There are so many problems with this \"laptop\" (which is not really a laptop) that I don't know where to begin.First of all, this machine does not give the human owner of it even the slightest degree of control over it. Every time I try to use it - and I mean every single time - the machine informs me that it needs to restart and update. I have tried every method at my disposal to prevent it from loading useless updates every single day but nothing works. The scenario is always the same: I turn the laptop on, it tells me updates need to be loaded, restarts, and starts loading updates, which takes anywhere between 15 minutes and an hour. Are you prepared to wait between 15 and 60 minutes every time you try to use your laptop? Well, neither am I.The software that is installed here is the eminently useless Windows 8. This laptop is in reality a tablet with a keyboard attached. As tablets go, however, it is quite low-quality. Even if you are among the very rare folks who do not detest Windows 8, you are bound to be shocked by the low quality of this product's hardware. The maximum charge of the battery out of the box was 95%. The processor is extremely slow, so you have to wait for ages to do anything. Opening a new Internet tab slows everything to a halt and you just need to sit there and wait, seething. I felt like I was back in the early nineties when it took every site ages to load.I have no idea why a laptop has to be burdened with a ton of preloaded apps. I also have no idea what the benefits of Windows 8 are. This is a device for people who want to browse apps, but forget about doing any serious work on it. You will have no control over this device. Windows, apps, tabs, etc. will jump out at you when you least expect or need them. But try opening a program or tab that you actually need. This will take forever. Windows 8 doesn't even let you turn off the computer. It needs to be on constantly, uploading nobody knows what endlessly and relentlessly.It is a very strange experience for me to have a brand-new laptop in the house that I never use. But doing anything on this device leads to such constant aggravation that I prefer simply to leave it alone. It is like this strange creature that lives by your side doing its own thing and resisting any attempt you make to get it to serve your purposes.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo":
