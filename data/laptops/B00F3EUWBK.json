I got this computer and started it up and did all the necessary stuff I needed too. I hardly put anything on the computer except a few songs and pictures but nothing other than that. So I go to play my facebook game and it is just running sooooo slow. I even had the thing freeze on me and had to end the task via task manager. I also noticed that my cpu usage is at 60% and my memory usage is around 56% and I had nothing running but task manager. I did everything without removing important stuff and I still can't get it to not freeze when I play a single facebook game. My old laptop is 6 years old, and it runs 10xs faster(ABSOLUTELY no lie). It's definitely defective and I am sending it back immediately. This product doesn't work at all for ANYTHING other than surfing the web, and depending on where you go, it's slow too. Just wish there was a decent performing laptop I could get that didn't fail on me all the time. Good riddance!!", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Update from Netbbok", "Author": "Paul Bech", "ReviewID": "RJ6XX5ZANB57H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new Netbook but wanted HDMI out and a slightly larger screen.
