And I think I got a Lemon worth $1150.  Computer Upgrade King claimed it to be \"new\".  Not sure what it means but the top of the box is retaped and the contents inside are all lose.  I did not even want to attempt opening it. It is going back to amazon fulfillment center.  I am quite disappointed with this buying experience.  I even bought an mSATA SSD and RAM memory to upgrade the laptop and now I have to return them as well.  When i asked Amazon rep if they check whether a unit is new or not before they ship, she confirmed that for products sold by tird parties and fulfilled by amazon, they don't check if that is the case.  Thus, BUYER BEWARE.  This kind of purchase experience leaves a sour taste about buying things from third parties on amazon esp. if amazon fulfills it as no one is checking or guaranteeing that you are getting what you ordered.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Deffective", "Author": "PAUL M", "ReviewID": "R3SZI3UDYUD4AP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My first Lenovo was a ThinkPad T60. Since than, the build quality is going down with each generation.
