{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Inexpensive and Powerful. Great Value!", "Author": "Josh from Boston \"joshman25\"", "ReviewID": "R3ABKBSGJEB4DL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop to use as my Digital Audio Workstation (DAW). I wasn't looking to spend too much, but I wanted a minimum spec, which this laptop filled. Most important was a dual core processer. The i5 in this machine is plenty powerful enough for my use. I also wanted a 7200rpm hard drive - this one has it. I did upgrade the RAM to the full 16GB (an extra $88 in Crucial memory) - the machine comes with 4GB and is upgradable to 16GB. That upgrade took all of 1 minute. All in, I spent under $700 for a laptop that could have easily cost $900 or more.I love the look of this thing. It's big, with a large screen. Might not be a great traveling laptop, but for my needs it is exactly what I want.Everything arrived in new condition. Fired it up out of the box and installed the updates. NO bloat ware to deal with at all, really. Just some HP tools that you don't need enable. This laptop is clean and PERFECT for my use. No processing issues when recording music - I get about 4 or 5ms latency using ASIO drivers - I can get similar latency with the WAVE RT driver as well. The Windows rating on this system is 5.9 out of 7.9 which is pretty respectable.I'm running Mixcraft Pro Studio 6.0, Superior Drummer 2.0 & Melodyne Editor 2 without any hiccups.I'm extremely pleased with my decision to go with this laptop. Yes, it comes with the Windows 8 upgrade but I'm not touching it! Windows 7 Pro is very stable and what I'm sticking with in this particular instance.I would recommend this laptop of you're on a budget and looking for performance without a bunch of frills. There's no office productivity software pre-installed so if you're buying this for business purposes make sure you have all of the software you want to run. I'm sure that's one of the reasons the price is so reasonable.For the home audio enthusiast, this is a great entry point platform for your audio recording and editing needs.", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm very happy with this laptop.", "Author": "Donna Gray", "ReviewID": "R2DEGF5TG2IRTY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the raised keys on the keyboard.  I like how quiet this laptop is.  The sound and video are very good.  Compared to other laptops I've had it's amazingly quiet..  It's nice and light.  My last laptop, an Acer, would get burning hot.  Not this one.  Thanks to some new technology developed by HP it stays cool, which is a very nice feature.  It's fast enough. I tried a Toshiba laptop before I got this one but sent it back because the sound and picture were both terrible, and because I HATED the Windows 8 operating system.  I feel very lucky to have found this excellent computer with Windows 7, which I much prefer. I would recommend this laptop.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT BUSINESS LAPTOP !!!", "Author": "Yuva", "ReviewID": "R2QIVPY8VDQT3X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Alright guys, let me see how precise I can be with this review. I bought this machine for a client of mines and they absolutely love it!First of with the build quality. Its brushed aluminium with some plastic around so the build quality does feel pretty solid. It's a bit heavier than the equivalent lenovo with the same specs but it's not terrible and of the bat, of the better things about the build quality is that everything sits securely on the machine. The lenovo I bought a while aback had q/c issues with the dvd drive sticking out. But this machine was perfect. Oh the machine is a little wider than you think it is, but its not that big a deal. the black finish at the bottom hides how wide the machine actually is.Now for what comes in the box. I TOTALLY LOVEEEEEEEEE the fact that it came with BOTH operating system DVD's. HP ... YOU GUYS ROCK FOR THAT! So this laptop came with both installation cd's, either windows 7 pro or windows 8 pro, which ever you choose to upgrade it to. And of course with all HP machines it comes with a tonne of bloatware that would take you at least an hour to get rid off (my only major gripe but I still give it 5 stars). But one you get rid of the HP bloatware it works brilliantly!Now I did notice an earlier review where someone was complaining about it coming in french which I did think was a bit odd. But for those of you who are reading this rewview pay attention. When the laptop is booting for the FIRST time a screen will come up to select which language you want installed to use your machine. YOU MUST BE VERY CAREFUL AT THIS POINT. Because once you select the wrong language it cannot be undone unless you do a complete reinstall. So I figured either the gentleman or his mom was rushing the setup and didn't realise until it was too late. So ppl, please be careful when running the set up.And I absolutely HAVE to mention the software update for this machine. Now when I was trying update the lenovo I kept getting a stupid error about the updates failing and had to go through the painstaking task of installing them one by one. Which I thought was a bit odd. And guess what, on the dare HP ... NO SUCH PROBLEMS !!! Clicked download, windows installed, even told me there were some unecessary updates and to date it's purring like a kitten !!!And one final thing is that FN key was not working on my laptop. I was abit alarmed and concerned at first, but if its one thing, I can't fault HP online customer support, and sure enough there was a nice little file on HP's website which said HP FN driver update/fix .. and with that installed the machine didn't fail to impress me.All in all I highly recommend this HP laptop, which is strange of me to say because I used to hate HP, but if I had to choose this and the lenovo(which was a fingerprint magnet btw), I DEFINITELY would go with this!If any of you who are reading this and still have more questions.

It works as expected.  I got this one because I didn't want windows 8, but wanted a decent amount of memory.  This gave me the option of sticking with 7 and also gave me a disk I could use to upgrade to windows 8 if I ever feel adventuresome.  I like the key board.  The keys are raised.  There are some features I haven't tried yet.  It is light weight.  That is a plus.  Much faster than my other laptops.  The CD/DVD slot is not well designed, is flimsy and is hard to open.  Update:  It has a strange deal with the mouse.  There is a small pin light (not a button) in the left portion of the mouse closest to the monitor.  If you touch it by accident the light will come on and your mouse will freeze.  The only thing that will make the mouse unfreeze is to tap that light several times.  Apparently my other HP laptop is like this as well and I never have been unfortunate enough to accidently press it.  Other than several hours of panic, it didn't harm anything.  But scared me to have my computer essentially frozen and unable to access my documents.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good All Around", "Author": "Roger Dodger", "ReviewID": "R2CXGZCDHMCM3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only complaint I have about this laptop is that it's a little big.  But hey, I knew that going into it.  I upgraded from a Toshiba 13.3\" ultrabook that was very light-weight and compact but lacked a little on the power side.  I found myself needing a little more power.15.6\" is a little larger than I am used to, but I can't blame HP for that -- I knew what I was getting, and I'll get over it in time.  And it's actually a lot lighter weight than other comparably sized laptops.Beyond that, I have a lot of good things to say about this laptop.  First off, it's one of the few laptops remaining on Amazon that comes with Windows 7 at all, much more Windows 7 Professional.  That was a serious selling point for me.  It's got some nice features like a fingerprint-reader that you can setup to process your Windows login rather than typing in a password, which is fun as well.It also has an excellent keyboard that feels just right...raised keys that have just enough umphh to feel what you are typing, and a 10-key! (Okay, I'm an accountant, so 10-keys matter to me more than most.)I am consistently getting about 6 hours of battery life doing light computing (word processing, internet surfing, but no video streaming or playing music.)  That's exactly what I was looking for.  And after coming from a 2nd generation i3 to this 3rd generation i5, the thing seems blazingly fast.I've had this laptop for about 2 weeks and so far I am loving it.  As long as you are okay with a 15.6\" computer, I would highly recommend this.  And it came with a free Windows 8 disk if you ever feel the desire to upgrade...thus far I do not.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I fell in love with my new pc", "Author": "Bandoman \"bando\"", "ReviewID": "R1048RZKCZPF5J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have just received my HP ProBook 4540s few hours ago and I have spent some time playing around with it. So, this is only my first impression. I love everything about this laptop so far! I have just returned my $950 sony laptop and got this $600 HP laptop, and I am so happy to do so. This is a really good laptop for students.I will write more about this laptop in few months, the time for me to go deeper in its features and usage.By the way, thank you very much to all people who write reviews about products on amazon.com and online sites. 5 stars for the seller TigerDirect, 5 stars for Amazon.com (I sell and buy on Amazon, and I love the way they handle this business), and more than 5 stars for this wonderful laptop. This is not my first laptop. In fact, in the last 4 years, I have own laptops from Dell, Asus, Apple MacBook (which I returned), Samsung, Sony (which I have just returned today). I have also owned an all in one pc from Asus and another from Sony.

So far I love it. I had to get all the advertisements cleaned out of it when I first bought it (downloads come with them automatically now I guess), but now that I've got the bugs worked out, it performs well. Glad I got one with Windows 7 instead of 8. I've heard lots of bad things about Windows 8. I'm a Realtor, so I don't do a lot of gaming and store a minimum amount of pictures on it, but overall, everything works like it should. It doesn't get hot on my lap like my old computer and is faster and lighter which I like. I also like the fact that you can turn off the thumb pad if you want with a double tap in the upper left hand corner.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP 4540S i5", "Author": "PCDuck \"PCDuck\"", "ReviewID": "RKNHKNHZH14W1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very good laptop. Make sure you create a system restore point once you buy it and start using it. You can always go to that point without using any disks.

It came quickly and was well packaged. It set right up out of the box with no problems. I also liked that it came with Win7 Pro installed, with the option to install Win 8 yourself, if you want it, which I did not.  It comes with CDs for both Win programs, and with accompanying Recovery CDs for both programs. There were quite a few downloads from Windows Update for Win 7 to take care of, but no problems with that, other than some time.I too liked the raised keys.  The screen resolution is very good and adjustable.It comes with very little in the way of added software (unusual), except Windows Explorer. It has its own security protection system, which I have not delved into yet.I will echo the complaint about the sorta flimsy CD/DVD slot, but I found the easy way to open it was to just click on it from \"My Computer\" and it pops right open.  I just try to be real careful with it because of its seeming fragility.  Aside from that slot, the computer is very stoutly built, but not too heavy or inconvenient in any way.It connected to my router right away and so far everything has been great.  Will update, if that changes.  I appreciate those that posted their opinions before me, because I relied in part on those reviews in making my purchase.I especially appreciated those reviewers who \"alerted\" to the issue of the \"language setup\" choice at the beginning of the setup program, because if one is not paying close attention at the time, and just hits \"next\", one can easily end up with French as the default language, since French is the first language listed in the choices, and I noticed that it states just below on that screen that the choice cannot be changed thereafter.  I presume that you can uninstall and reinstall since you have the CD, but it was because of that alert in the previous reviews, that I made sure to pay special attention for that particular question.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Trix", "ReviewID": "R29HYYWCYG7COS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that I don\u2019t write any product reviews, mainly because I\u2019m excessively lazy. Also, with so many people already writing such thorough reviews, I figured that the average buyer would already have a decent overview of what to expect. Additionally, I was hesitant to buy laptops online because I couldn\u2019t physically assess it (important to me, a non-computer person), but I\u2019ve been so pleased with this purchase that I felt the urge to write a review.Pros:- Windows 7 \u2013 one of the top reasons why I bought this laptop. Don\u2019t get me started on Windows 8. I find it gimmicky, loathe it with a passion, and have generally accepted the fact that I will stick it out with Windows 7 until Microsoft releases a newer version that at least offers the option to switch to a permanent desktop mode.  The laptop itself comes with both Windows 7 and Windows 8 CDs.- Looks nice \u2013 the brushed aluminum makes for a beautiful silver/grey matte finish. Go to YouTube and search \u2018HP ProBook 4540s\u2019. There are unboxing videos aplenty. It\u2019s hard to deny how aesthetically pleasing it is.- Keyboard is easy to use, as is the two-button touchpad. Call me old fashioned, but I dislike touchpads with no physical buttons.  Of course, that\u2019s just my own personal preference.- Decent battery life \u2013 about 5 hours worth of moderate use (i.e. surfing the web + streaming videos + Microsoft Word + editing software)- Automatic internet connection even after hours of idleness. It\u2019s as if I never left the laptop!This might not seem like a big deal, but compared to my old Lenovo laptop (bought 2010), which always needed troubleshooting and manual resetting for the internet to start working again, this is a godsend.- Fingerprint reader- Anti-glare LED-backlit displayCons:- CD/DVD slot is difficult to open and rickety. Even when you press the button, it takes a few extra seconds to eject, and once open, it\u2019s wobbly.- 4GBs of RAM \u2013 perfectly fine for regular school/office work use, but probably not enough if you need to run photo/video/sound editing software + video streaming + surfing the web + other programs. This is easily upgradable, however.- Heavy, not very portable, not suitable for travelling \u2013 15.6\u201d screen, about 5 lbs. Then again, you probably already know this from reading the specs.Minor quibbles:- You have to press the fn + louder/softer/mute buttons simultaneously to change the volume\u2013personally, a bit of an inconvenience- Headphone port in an awkward place, right underneath your left hand. It would be nicer if the port was on either side of the laptop.Overall though, I love this laptop to pieces. I read Josh from Boston\u2019s review and may follow suit with some form of RAM upgrade.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Notebook for business or home... Ordered it Windows 7....
