Windows 8 runs so slow that the time it takes to load pictures from a phone is measured in minutes. My wife, instead of using this laptop to browse the web, uses her phone instead as its quicker. At this moment, I found this while looking for a way to boot by CD so I can install Windows 7 on it and have been trying to do this for the last couple of hours. If I had it to do all over again, there's no way I'd buy this laptop. Do yourself a favor, RUN.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awful - Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5302", "Author": "bankerkys", "ReviewID": "RN49LS52OR1JO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Toshiba Satellite C855D-S5302 - terrible laptop computer.
