{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great spec but failed in all direction", "Author": "RC", "ReviewID": "R2QHBYGB96RBUO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this with high expectations given the great specs.1. One of the worst contrast and viewing angle for a laptop.  For the money and full HD you would expect something respectable.2. Extremely poor touch pad execution.  Until the win8.1 update I wasn't even able to turn off the useless touch pad.3. For a i7-4700 8 threads  CPU the performance is very limited due to the poor memory configuration4. The GigE network is one of the slowest (HP trying to save a few bucks here)5. Replace the Wireless card with an Intel 7260 and got reasonable performance. The generic is very limited.6. Extremely poor keyboard for typing.  Placement of keys and key travel is very limiting.7. Excessively heavy for what you get.  The base frame is VERY heavy.  Could have been easily a lb lighter.8. Poor mechanical construction.  (The edge of the case cut my hands multiple times while carrying it w/o a sleeve)9. Replaced the mSata and Sata with fast SSD helped but the above issues are still very limiting.These comments applies to most of the Envy 15t Quad models.  They all have the same poor construction and display.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not trusty seller", "Author": "Carlos Werlang Lebelein", "ReviewID": "R3HJEOG8FFD2F0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not trust on this seller, unfortunelly I had experience of buying a laptop from this guys, what a bad decision...6 months and the computer is not working, the computer go and back to the support with the same problem...without any care and quality regards of the Eluktronics...do not trust on this seller...be aware that the support do not work if you need.
