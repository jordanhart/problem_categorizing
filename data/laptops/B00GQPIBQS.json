It is an over priced, underpowered, fancy looking piece of crap. It will not only struggle to run multiple tabs in your web browser, but even watching a video is a struggle for this laptop. God forbid you try to do something else on it when you're watching a video. Sure the touch screen is entertaining for a while, but your never use it after a few weeks and it eats battery life like no bodies business. Take the money you could spend on this and buy yourself a laptop that can actually function", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "CPU Type: i5 4-th Generation\nScreen Size: 14\" Touchscreen\nMemory: 6GB DDR3\nHard Drive: 500GB with 32GB ExpressCache\nOperating System: Windows 8 64-bit", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite E45T-A4200 14\" Touch-Screen Laptop i5 2.6GHz 6GB 500GB", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41EhNoabqKL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GQPIBQS"}}
