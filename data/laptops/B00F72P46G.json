{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "007", "ReviewID": "R3UINRGLZMBBUE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm writing this review on the laptop I just received and the keys feel a little cheap but the form factor and the decent screen and the rest of the laptop seem very solid and for what your getting under the hood I think its worth it. The laptop is very quiet and the fan barely comes. The harddrive is fricken silent vs the samsung and the software can be updated without having to be approved by asus. It is FAR AND AWAY the best cheap laptop vs the samsung series 3 that I bought and should have waited for this. Have some issues that need to be cleared up with amazon as far as I didn't get a notification that the order went through and didn't bother checking to see what was going on till I went to deposit my check but that wont' reflect on the score of the laptop as its awesome!", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Look elsewhere for a budget laptop", "Author": "Michael Mongeau", "ReviewID": "R2KU4EO9CR1NUH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst laptop I have ever owned, and I have purchased many over the years. It feels cheap and poorly constructed. The key action is terrible and the space bar does not work half the time unless pressed in very specific spots.  Worst of all there are no access bays on the underside to add memory or swap out the hard drive. You have to remove the plastic covering that surrounds the keyboard and the remove some very flimsy ribbon cables to get access.  Absolute junk.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "pretty dissapointed", "Author": "ashley", "ReviewID": "R14IZEI6ORLUEU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i actually really like this laptop except for one thing...i had no idea that this laptop didnt have a cd rom drive that was why i wanted a laptop in the first place...i wont return it thought you live and learn i guess", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F72P46G"}}
