Shea", "ReviewID": "R284YNFG61TCBF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In March 2008, I decided it was time to upgrade from a G4-based laptop to one of the new Intel models. I deliberated back and forth whether the lower priced MacBook would be sufficient or whether to pay the premium for the \"Pro\" model. Ultimately, I decided upon the MacBook Pro for these reasons.Construction qualityThe aluminum case of the MacBook Pro reminds me of a product made by the Swiss. The build quality is outstanding for a mass-produced device. It feels very substantial, and all the pieces fit together nearly seamlessly. The MacBook's case, however, is made from a high-grade plastic rather than metal. It's nice ... but I found the front edge of the MacBook's case a bit sharp on my wrists as I typed.PortsCompared with the MacBook, the MacBook Pro provides an additional USB port plus Firewire 800. The latter is desirable for people who work with video and external drives that have Firewire 800 connectors. The ExpressCard slot is useful for future expansion and services such as wireless broadband (EVDO).KeyboardKeyboard experiences are subjective; but I find the keyboard on the MacBook Pro the most comfortable of any laptop I've ever used. It feels solid and responsive. Plus, its backlighting is helpful when typing in dark environments.Dedicated videoUnlike the MacBook that shares system memory for video (integrated graphics), the MacBook Pro has a dedicated video processor. This is beneficial for driving large external displays and running graphics-intensive applications.Is the MacBook Pro worth the $700 price differential over a MacBook? That depends on whether you are a general home computer user (i.e., e-mail, web browsing, iTunes, word processing) or someone who uses their laptop for more advanced purposes. My user profile is more in the second category. Also, since I intend to keep this computer for three years, I figure that the premium breaks down to about $233 each year. This seems reasonable to me for something I use every day.In view of the additional quality and benefits that the MacBook Pro offers, I think its higher price brings with it commensurate value. It's hard to imagine even finicky laptop users being disappointed with the MacBook Pro.P.S. -- There are two 15-inch MacBook Pro models. I bought the 2.4 gHz \"entry level\" model. It is the better value. I do not feel the 2.5 gHz MacBook Pro is worth the extra $500.Also, people who care to add system memory (beyond the stock 2 gigabytes supplied by Apple) ought to purchase it from a third-party vendor and install it themselves. It is a simple process.", "Date": "March 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Finally, the perfect desktop replacement", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "RAGIRU3TFA2QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Short and Quick ReviewThis model is worth the 500 difference between the entry level.  The screen is beautiful, the new LED Displays are great, better color depth, more color, the laptop doesn't get as hot as previous versions.  Everything works, it is very fast, and this laptop replaced 2 high end workstations + 2 high end laptops (A dell with workstation class graphics card, and 17 inch macbook pro).  I can edit 1080p high def video in real time with no slow down, edit my 12mp raw files in real time with no slow down.  I can play the latest games like Call of Duty 4 maxed out on windows vista at native resolution with no slow down online.With the beefy 250gb HD, ability to upgrade to 4gb of ram, the 512 graphics card, and 6mb cache, this machine is a complete replacement for me, and revolutionizes my life, work style, and workflow.It is worth buying, and definitely better than the 2k version, by leaps, read my longer review for more.Longer Fuller Review.The new macbook pros are fantastic!  I had a 17 inch core 2 duo before,  it was nice, but it didn't do everything I wanted or needed.  I was forced to keep my mac pro, and my custom built windows PC for running the applications I need, and the ability to play games (I do some freelance game design, as well as photography and animation work)I grew tired of having so many workstations, but what can you do when you need the power?  Apples new macbook pro has answered my needs.  I have wanted a laptop with a 512mb graphics card for years, it has never happened until now.Previous to this laptop, my laptops have been \"toys\" the only close workstation I had was a dell that cost close to 3k, and would break your back to carry it (but it had a 512 workstation class graphics card!)With this laptop, I have sold my other machines, it is all I need, or want.  If it meets my needs and expectations, it should be able to meet yours easily.The reason you buy this model, is because of the graphics card, and the increase in l2 cache on the processor.  The 2k model has less cache than last years santa rosa model (3mb compared to last years 4mb) this model and the 17 inch has 6mb, as well as the 512mb graphics card, dual core processor, and the ability to use 4gb of ram.After getting the laptop, I use bootcamp to repartition the harddrive (did not need to reinstall OS X, was able to do this on the fly to install windows)  I split it up to give me 165gb for OS X, and the rest for windows.I need to use specialized software that requires windows, and these programs also require very high end workstations.  The life of someone in 3d is not easy.  This workstation takes care of all my needs.  I'm running the 32 bit version of vista ultimate (the 64 bit is horrible, do not run it)  I use windows to run the programs I need (mainly zbrush, unreal engine, and 3ds max)  I can and do have maya, and can use it on this partition as well as os x thanks to the dongle, but I cannot use my creative suite software on windows, because of adobes licensees.  (though oddly enough, I can run Lightroom on both platforms)On my OS X side, I run maya, photoshop, after effects, and final cut studio (with shake 4.1, yes I need 2 compositing programs)  I have no problems running these programs on this system.  I can render out quickly, everything is snappy.  With the 8600 geforce (opposed to ATI) maya is very responsive, and I get very few render errors.  Dynamics are able to be rendered on this machine, and I can run simulations with ease.  Render times are quite quick, and this system is very responsive.I do photo editing, and this machine is fast as well (I upgraded to 4gb of ram myself for 95 dollars) my camera is a nikon d300,  which is 12mp,  I use lightroom and photoshop extensively, and at the same time with no problems at all.I also run maya and photoshop cs3 together all the time (with itunes in the background).With leopard, I find using this machine even better.  I can use spaces, and have maya on one screen, then I can swtich to another screen with photoshop to paint textures, or reference something, and go to another screen for safari or itunes.The touchpad is cool.  Even in windows, I can right click by using both fingers on the touch pad, and clicking with the bar, very smart apple!  it works in OS X as well (but you have to enable it)I bought the apple keyboard (not the wireless, as I need a full size keyboard) and that keyboard is fantastic, the best I have ever owned.  I love it.  I also bought the logitech g9 mouse to use as my mouse (I cannot stand Mighty Mouse)  this mouse is perfect, and similar price.  With the wired keyboard you get use ports on the side, so you can attach the mouse to the keyboard with no problems.  And it saves on clutter.For those who enjoy playing video games (I do help make them)  you will be happy to know you can play the latest games on PC here with great ease.  I can play call of duty 4, at native res of 1440x900 (on vista) with little to no slowdown.  Same for Unreal 3 (and all games that use this engine).  I can play Half Life 2 and Team Fortress 2 maxed out all the way, at the native screen res, with no problems at all.  I can play crysis, and bioschock (not maxed out, but pretty close).I have not been so excited about a laptop in ages.  I had the original powerbook and used it all over, but it was slow, it was something to use when on the road, and at school.  When the first macbook pro came out, I was all over it, the software was buggy, it only allowed 2gb of ram, and it was not practical as my only system, nor was it applicable for heavy use by me.  I got the 17 inch when the core 2 duo's came out, it was great, very snappy, and with the 256 card it was close to everything I need (but only 3gb of ram)  I skipped the santa rose, as It did not really address anything.  This model addresses everything.  With 4gb of ram, 2 cores, 6mb of l2 cache, and a 512mb graphics card, there is nothing I cant do.I edit HD video (1920x1080p) in final cut with no problems.  I composite this video in shake with 3d made in maya with NO PROBLEMS.  I play high end PC games maxed out with no problems!  (Call of Duty 4 is a hard game to run, this runs it and I can play it maxed at native res, online, with no slowdown at all).I work on my raw images from my nikon with no problems at all.  This machine is just perfect.  Everything works the way it should, and the way it needs to.The only complaint I have is they did not include remotes in this revision.  You can still access Front Row by using Command ESC and use that to view videos (which look very good on my HDTV).I should also note, if you buy another keyboard (such as the apple external which I highly recommend (the wired, not wireless)  You need to go into system preferences and turn off the optiion for F Keys, as this keyboad has an FN button, like the one on the laptop, and renders using your f keys impossible without pressing fn, turning on that option, makes your keyboard normal, and you can use fn to adjust the volume of your laptop.Right now I have this laptop hooked up to my HDTV using the supplied DVI to VGA cable, and a line out form the laptop.  I have sound on my tv (which I could pipe to a sound system if needed, or (what I do) have it piped to my wireless head phones).  This laptop is where it is at.Please, do not think the 500 dollars for this model over the other is not worth it, as it is very much worth it.  The difference between this model, and the 2k model is night and day for me.  It goes from a toy, I can use when on the plane, to my only computer!  And that is HUGE if you are anything like me.Now the difference between this and the 17 inch does matter.  If you get the 17 inch, you will likly not be playing the latest games at native resolution, and I plan on using this hooked up to my TV, so I do not need 2 extra inches.  If you will only be using the laptop, and have no plans on games, the 17 inch may be better for you.  After reading many reviews, the 15 inch has better response times, and everything is slightly snappier than the 17 inch, which is why I went with the 15.  There is not much a difference in size between the 2, the 17 is not much bigger than the 15, but for me, you could not get me to part with my 15 inch for anything.This laptop is perfect, get it, and enjoy it.  The design will likely change by the next revision (rumored in june / july)  this could be the last time you can get such a beautiful laptop, that works perfectly, and is everything you can want.5 out of 5, no problems at all.", "Date": "April 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Performance, Poor Display", "Author": "Joseph \"Photographer\"", "ReviewID": "R20V94KULGSNCJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "As my second Apple purchase (first being an IPOD Touch 16GB) I am quite upset. This is my first Macbook and I am Impressed with several things. Performance, Build, Style, Sound, Touch pad responsiveness and Overall quality get perfect 10's in my book. However, the reason for the 2 star rating was the quality of the display.Do a little researching on YELLOWING and you will know what I'm talking about. The first MBP I received from amazon had about 2 inches of yellow (stained) pixels at the bottom of the screen. I brought it to the apple store and the guy noticed it and offered a replacement, warning me that if I take the replacement I am risking getting a worse display. He opened a brand new box for me and the display had no yellowing but had BRIGHT SPOTS all over the place. This affected more of the middle of the screen so I went back a second time for my third replacement. This MBP has also disappointed me because it also has YELLOWING on about the bottom third of the screen.Still, I am debating of going back to the Apple store to replace or just simply return this laptop and go with something else. Keep in mind I have owned this for 7 days total. This is a very valid issue and for a $2000 plus investment it is something to consider.This is a known problem since the SR MBP's and I thought they would have fixed it in quality control but no. I will give Apple credit for great quality service, but they should really spend more money on quality control!I have the Macbook Pro 15.4\" 2.4GHz 200GB.The displays affected were the 9C81, 9C81 and 9C83... two had yellowing, one had uneven bright/dark spots.", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "This machine is simply PERFECT!", "Author": "physicistjedi", "ReviewID": "R27CDRT59SA6VR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am looking at this machine and thinking hard, but just can not find anything negative.

It is MUCH improved now - much better saturationand has the contrast of glossy without the reflections.Usage:In less than 5 minutes, I upgraded to 4 Gigs RAM - bought that for about $60 from Amazon.I am keeping my two original 1 Gig sticks in case I need them in the future.I have VMWare Fusion running Windows XP Professional for some of mymust-have Windows apps. I have given the VM 1 Gig of RAM and 40 Gigs of disk.Performance of Mac apps and Windows apps is superb.I am using a WD Passport 320GB USB drive for backups with Time Machine.Battery:Last about 2.5-3 hours with almost constant usage. The best thing is when I close the lid,it goes to sleep instantly, and wakes up instantly when I need it again, with no loss ofbattery regardless of how long it sleeps. That is VERY DIFFERENT from my experience withWindows laptops that lose battery even when sleeping. No idea why.Storage:It came with a 5400RPM 250GB HD. I bought a WD 7200RPM 320GB with a big buffer fromNewegg - I plan to swap out the HD - that  requires \"minor surgery\" so I am doing my researchbefore I do it this weekend. The new disk will be a lot faster, although the it comes withseems to be pretty fast already. I am swapping as I like doing stuff like that.UPDATE: I swapped the hard drive and did a full restore from Time Machine - it now is exactlythe same as my las back-up with all apps and settings, except with a bigger and faster hard drive.This \"surgery\" is t for the faint of heart. :-) And is probably totally unnecessary for most folks.Mac OS X:So simple. After using Windows PCs and laptops for over 15 years, I am amazed how easyand intuitive it was to use a new OS. I know Mac OS X is very powerful and I am just beginningto learn the advanced features to play with. Being able to run Windows XP in a VM with such a smallload on the system is very nice. I use software apps that are either not available on the Mac yet,or have much older versions on the Mac. This is not specifically about the MacBook Pro but thefact that the MacBook Pro has enough juice to do this is what is worth noting.Boot Times:When I shutdown and restart,  it comes up in 30 seconds or so. Much faster than my experiencewith Windows laptops. Here's the best part - if I put the Windows VM to sleep in my Mac,it comes back up in seconds! Much faster than Windows used to wake up on a Windows laptop!So for a portable laptop, the MacBook Pro is quite powerful and fast.Overall:I am glad I bought this model instead of the new Unibody model. This is by far the best portable computerI have ever owned. I've always felt that the MacBook Pro carries a price premium over \"equivalent\" ormore feature rich Windows laptops, but now I know why. They are better.", "Date": "November 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "2 weeks into the switch", "Author": "Software Craftsman", "ReviewID": "R3BU15IBGYAQM9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "There was no reason for me to switch to a Mac product.  I've always have been intrigued, but XP was doing it for me day in and out.  My current Dell Latitude was on its way out and I wanted something high quality.  I couldn't find anything that comes close in build quality/finish to the Macbook Pro.  Asus makes some nice notebooks but I didn't want Vista, with all of its assorted issues and XP doesn't seem like a sound choice given its looming end of life.So now I have my Macbook Pro.  As a software developer I was drawn to the idea of a UNIX shell as a first class citizen (sorry Cygwin).  The toughest part is learning the keys.  In XP I could move around an IDE effortlessly, with keys: home,end,ctrl-arrow etc.; not so on the Mac keyboard.  This proved the most frustrating.  The lack of the forward delete is also a disappointment but I hear there are keyboard mapping solutions.I installed VMware Fusion and XP for initial comfort and to ease the transition off windows.  BTW, Fusion is amazing.  It feels like it's native, and it's definitely faster than XP on my current Dell.  With Fusion, I can map drives, cut and paste and access servers between the two -- it's all very fluid.  Full screen your Fusion in a different Expose window and you can quickly swap back and forth between Mac and XP.Now the downside.  In the first few days I experienced no less than 4 crashes, where it had to be power cycled.  I haven't had any issues since, so I'm going to conveniently forget.  Firefox crashes still, but no more than it did on windows, and maybe less.So in conclusion, Mac was the right choice for me.  High quality in and out and at a decent price.  The interface is pure eye candy and orders of magnitude superior (usability-wise) than XP.  While there will be some pain points in learning, it will hopefully be worth it.  Get VMware Fusion and install Windows for when there is no Mac alternative.*UPDATE* I have now had the macbook pro for 2 months.  I'm really enjoying some of the UI features, such as expose and spaces more and more.  The hotkeys are awesome (e.g. show desktop, lock/start screensaver).There are however a few recurring problems that I have been experiencing.  I'm going to detail the top two.  The first issue is the screensaver hotkey stops working at times.  This is a huge issue because it is also the mechanism for locking my computer, and I cannot leave my desk w/o locking it, so I must either close the lid (sleep) or restart, which fixes the issue.Now for the second issue: often when I try and restart/shutdown, it does nothing, then a minute later tells me that Finder failed to quit and I should quit Finder then try again -- great suggestion Apple, given that you CAN'T QUIT FINDER!! So now I have to hold the power button down for 10 seconds to kill it or run \"sudo shutdown -r now\" from Terminal.So in my latest conclusion, my mac is not living up to my expectations of reliability.  I was led to believe, by many in the mac community/stupid commercials, that Mac was the panacea from XP.  The Mac user interface is *unmatched* and that along with the UNIX foundation were and still are my original reasons for choosing Mac.  My previous XP Pro notebook however was significantly more stable.  The reliability issues are getting more and more annoying and I just hope Apple is able to resolve and restore my faith in their product.  Lastly, I would change the star rating to three but it won't seem to let me.", "Date": "April 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "From PC: Macbook Pro blew past my expectations", "Author": "K.

It is indeed a very significant upgrade to my 1st Generation MBP.  I won't get into nitty gritty tech specs, as most people I know buy Macs because they want to use their computer, not the other way around.The screen is a lot crisper.  My understanding is that it's an LED-based screen, which results in increased battery life.  On the topic of battery life, out of the box I'm getting 4.5-5.0 hours worth of battery life--dramatically better than the 3 hours max I got out of my 1st gen MBP.The processing power is dramatically increased, as well.  I never had trouble running anything on the old MBP until I got Parallels--I had to upgrade the old machine to 2 GB of RAM to get performance to an acceptable level and even then it was sluggish.  Not the case with the 2.4 Ghz MBP with 2 GB of RAM.Boot up time is significantly increased with this machine and the wireless seems to have extended range versus the prior version.  I attribute part of this to using an 802.11n base station, but I also notice that I pick up more WiFi access points near me, as well and some of them are Belkin 802.11g.The one thing that I do find annoying is that Apple changed the assignments for the function keys.  Having used Mac laptops for ~5 years, I found this to be very annoying.  I was able to work around this by changing the key assignments back to what I know.In all, a phenomenal upgrade in terms of what you get out of the box, raw processing power, boot time, and increased battery life.

I remember when windows 95 first came out and how bad Macs sucked back then.  However times change.  The main thing that did it for me was that I could have both windows and OSX on the same machine using boot disk.  The verdict, I am now a Mac man.  And no I don't have the little apple sticker on the back of my car window in case you are wondering.Boot Disk works flawlessly and when I boot up windows (mainly for work) it is like I have a PC, (a really bad a** PC). When I first got it I thought I would be spending most of my time in windows using OSX for \"fun\" however after a week I realized that OS X Leopard blows windows out of the water.  Every aspect is better.  Let me say that again:  EVERY aspect of Leopard is better than windows XP.  I haven't found one thing in windows that I like better that what Leopard has.  Apple simply has the best user interface engineers on the planet working for them.  Now to be fair I haven't yet used Vista (haven't felt compelled at all so far based on what I have seen) so I don't have a basis for direct comparison to MS newest product.Wireless works great, bluetooth works flawlessly.  OH and the DVI out is amazing!  I can plug the DVI out to my receiver and watch full screen HD video on the plasma!  I tried this with my old PC, even bought a new video card to do it, but frankly it couldn't hold a candle to the mac.  Macbook pro also has Optical audio out for connection to the receiver, very nice. Speakers on the machine are better than average for a laptop but still not anything approaching audiophile quality.The machine comes packed with software that is actually useful, fun and has no crap on it.  ILife is great and easy to use.  The display is crisp, clear, vivid, etc, etc.  The best screen in the business.If I had to pick a con, I'd be price, though in comparison it is really not but a couple hundred bucks more than the equivalent PC.  What you get for that extra cash is a better user interface, better styling, smoother operation, faster performance.

The keyboard has a very easy and positive feel; lack of a numeric pad is no problem since I rarely used it when I had one. Serious design & bitmap work is done with an Intuos tablet anyway.

I have had no problems whatsoever, and it has met or exceeded all demands I have placed at its feet.  This a powerful and well designed laptop in every regard.Operating System:  #1 Reason to buy an Apple laptop.  I run Windows and Linux on my desktop, but for a laptop there is no reason not to go with Apple.  OSX is better in every aspect than Windows, and getting Linux to work well on most laptops is a pain in the @%$.Screen - #1 Reason to get a MBP over a MB.  Get the matte screen.  It is simply the best laptop screen on the market.  Hands down.  I have received compliments on the actual screen from people sitting next to me.  When you see a Dell or even a Lenovo next to the MBP, their screen just looks incredibly sad, dull and washed out while the the LED backlit matte MBP is very bright and crisp.Size/Weight:  Weighs the same as the normal MB, but slightly larger.  Five pounds is actually quite light for a laptop of this caliber.  I would prefer a 13\" form factor but the MBP wins in other regards, and the larger screen is certainly welcome.  If SIZE is a major issue, you might want to consider the MB, if WEIGHT is the main issue, consider the MBA.  If you carry around a bunch of other heavy stuff or need to travel ultra-light, this may not be the laptop for you.  However, if all you carry around is a laptop, a (paper) notebook, and some papers or a book, it's not an even an issue.  I carry this laptop a few miles walking almost every day and I don't even notice it.Quality: Top notch.  Feels solid, unlike many PC manufacturers Apple uses top quality components for ram, motherboard, power supply, etc.  If anything fails, Apple support has always been refreshingly helpful and accommodating.Metal Case:  If it wasn't for the white plastic case, I might have bought the regular Macbook.  I think the metal case is more professional, but this may just be personal taste.  Realistically, the plastic MB is probably more durable and alledgedly gets better WiFi reception.Power:  Used for extensive coding, video editing, photoshop, video playback, running Matlab simulations, etc.  Hasn't failed me yet.Battery:  Decent battery life, nothing amazing.In conclusion, if you need ultra-light, get a Macbook Air.  For all-around use or students, I think the Macbook is the best bet.  This is because I slightly prefer the Macbook keyboard, mag-latch, and form factor.

I love it.  I've been using PC based laptops for work and play for 15 years, and while I have dabbled on MacBooks (of various types) with friends over the years, this is my first Mac purchase and the first time I am using a Mac for work purposes.  In short, I could not be more satisfied with the machine itself.Externally, the 15.4 model is a sight to see.  It has an elegant, polished look about it.  More importantly, it has a sturdy feel to it.  So many PC laptops, including name brands (Dell, Compaq, etc.) have such a cheap, plastic feel about them, as if you could twist a little bit and something cheap would come flying off.  Not the MacBook Pro.  The aluminum shell and the solid body give it a confident feel, like it could take a little abuse if necessary.  The keyboard is just right: large keys, rightly placed, with a good feel--not to soft, not to much of a click.  That the FN function keys come set to serve as hardware options by default and Fn keys (F1, F2, etc.) only while holding down the Fn key seems backwards ... but its a simple switch in Preferences.  The ports on the sides seem sturdy and well place.  At first, I thought I would miss having all the ports tucked away on the back of the machine (as in the case of many PC laptops), but in the real world this has not turned out to be so bad after all.  Given the $2500 investment, I purchased a Speck clear cover and some ApplePeelz stick-on wrist guards, just to the keep the dings and sweat/grease stains to a minimum.  After all, I'm planning to take this machine for the long-haul.In terms of performance, the elegance on the outside is matched by the gears on the inside.  It really moves along.  I ponied up for some more RAM, making it a 4 gig machine, because I figured if I was paying $2500 for a machine, I may as well trick it out.  I run a typical suite of office programs - email, web, Microsoft Office, iTunes, syncing to a smartphone, scholarly research software, etc. - and the MacBook does great.  8 to 10 programs open at a time and not hesitation whatsoever.  And unlike Windows after 6 months, the overall system performance has not lagged.  I can put the Mac to sleep 6 times a day, and it always wakes up ready to go, full speed ahead.Sure, $2500 is (these days) a real investment in a laptop.  So if you just want to drop a little coin for a simple, what-you-pay-for is what-you-get machine, don't get this one. But if you are looking for a machine that looks and runs great, with an operating system that is simple (but not simplistic) and has a polish and flair that Windows has never even approached, then consider this model.

Bought the MacBook pro on Monday, received it on Thursday using free shipping.  The rebate is VERY easy to complete.  Took me about a minute to complete.  Seriously.  All is done online and you can check the status as well.Why I got this model:Spent a lot of time researching whether to get the early 2008 model or the late 2008 model.  Went with early 2008 for several reasons:1.) Price - saved hundreds versus the new Pros (even after all rebates from Amazon)2.) Matte screen - I got the MacBook Pro primarily for photography and didn't want glare causing me to keep bobbing my head when editing images.  I get enough headaches as it is.  Also didn't want it to limit where I work.  This may not be a big deal for everyone, but it was the main reason I even started to look at the older models.3.) More for the money - got the 2.5ghz, 512mb vram version for less money than the new 2.4ghz 256mb vram version.  Also has more L2 cache for whatever reason.  A speed test I came across on MacSales shows that this version of the MBP is actually faster than the new ones in about every category.  You can find the comparison in their memory sales section.4.) Perceived value - Just about three months ago, this model would have gone for the cost of the high end late 08 version brand new from Apple.  Now that the new version is out, I got this older version for significantly less than that.  Feels like a steal.MacBook Pro itself:As many people have written, I too am coming from the PC world over to the Mac world.  I have made the transition and, so far, am loving it.  I've always bought HP computers in the past and have purchased an Intel Core 2 Duo machine from HP...this computer breezes through everything way faster than any HP machine I've bought.  This is the first computer I've ever used that can actually keep up with me!  The build quality is solid.  It really is making working on a computer fun.  In fact, I wouldn't be writing this review if it weren't for the fact that I'm having fun just typing on the keyboard.  I've read some previous reviews saying that this laptop gets really hot...that hasn't been my experience.  I've been working on it for a solid 2 hours and it's very comfortable on my lap.  Yes, it's a little warm, but just warm.  Not hot.  Granted, I haven't been playing any games so if the warmth comes from the GPU, then I suppose I haven't given it a full test in that regard.  It's completely silent so far (again, something the GPU might change).I'm very pleased with this purchase.  I did A LOT of research on which model to buy, so there was no doubt in my mind that I was making the right decision.  I like the unibody case on the new Pros, but nothing else really makes me want to go that route.If you're considering this model, buy it while you can.  I'm absolutely thrilled with my purchase so far.", "Date": "December 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Notebook Perfection", "Author": "Mutulu1", "ReviewID": "R3CYKM36TF8IKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The macbook pro quite simply is the best notebook on the current market.  Currently on my third notebook ( the white & black macbook) I decided to upgrade to the pro.  If your like me and actually don't mind a larger notebook screen and paying for improved features, then this notebook is for you.  First off, you're getting a 2.4ghz processor (avoid the 2.5ghz pro, $500 for 1/10 faster processor and 50 gigs is not worth it to me), 200 gigs, dvd superdrive, 15.4 inch screen in either glossy or matted.  By the way, for those not sure which screen to choose, definitly go with the matted.  It's the best screen currently offered.  If you believe like me you purchase a notebook to mobilze it, then you are going to mind glare, shadows, sun, and other images showing up behind your screen.  It also makes sense if you are using the mbp for photo or video editing.  Glossy does not give you the true version of your images or video before moving them to dvd or image paper, rather what you look @ on matted is exactly what you're printing.  Gamers might prefer glossy.  The aluminum finish is flawless as well as the upgrades trackpad features similar to those on mba and the iphone.  I don't find myself using those features much, but it comes in handy when needed.  This machine is also an eye catcher.  i stopped @ panera bread w/ my wife after work to find 6 people asking me to see the pro.  This mbp is my primary computer (have a desktop pc and wife uses macbook white) and it's pretty much all i need.  Everything is on this computer and it doesn't miss a beat!  This machine is costly running @ 1,999.99.  However, you have to weigh the options; If you want a desktop notebook that has a large enough screen, tremendous features and fast processor and would like taking it on your deck, couch during a game, or to work, get this.  If you just need a machine parked @ the house for multiple users (family of 4??) this might not be the investment for you.  I prefer a computer for each person to avoid confusion.  Also recommend, Apeture 2, iWork, and time capsule for back up.  The only con I can give this machine is its opening latch button in the front.  I find it a bit small and you have to give it a good poke to open it.

I am the happy owner of a 15\" 2.2 GHz Macbook Pro from the last generation.  I am upgrading to the 17\" in the near future.  This is NOT a review but simply a warning.  The Amazon listing is INCORRECT.  The 1680x1050 display is NOT lit by LED's.  It is lit by CCFL's, ONLY the 1920x1200 upgrade screen is lit by LED's.  This upgraded screen is NOT available on Amazon.com  (Please note that ALL 15\" Macbook Pro's are LED screens)There is a large difference in the quality between these two with LED's being superior.  The whites are much whiter, the contrast is better.  Though they claim both are 300nits brightness, I find the LED's to look much brighter (possibly the combination of  whites and the better contrast)  Also know that Apple claims the LED screen's (that being the 1920x1200 screen) efficiency gives it 30 extra minutes of battery life over the CCFL versions (1680x1050 screens)  I hope this helps.

I wanted to share my experience with everyone and hopefully save you some time or even hassle.First off I specced a Dell XPS M1530 and saw that with some coupons I could get a much better PC at almost half the price.  Since I am not an advid Mac User this seemed like a better deal. I figured why pay more for OS X when Vista suits me just fine.  So I press the send button and placed my order.  Not being able to sleep at night I decided to see/feel the XPS at my local Bestbuy store.  First off the exterior of the Dell is quite nice and has a sturdy feel to it.  But when I opened the unit, the keboard wrist area looked kind of cheap.  I then booted it up and tried some videos / movies / games.  The one thing you will notice right away i that the speakers are AWFUL.  I was not expecting Bose like sound, but the sound reminded me of an old 386SX computer I use to have where all you needed was beeps and dings.  I went home cancelled my order with Dell.I knew I wanted th Apple MacBook Pro but then glossy or Matted.  After reading tons of reviews and opinions I decided the only way is to go down there.  I went to Apple and started looking at the screen side by side with pictures/movies/games.  Hands down in every aspect Glossy was much sharper clearer and color more vibrant.  I chose Glossy.Then of course do I get the 2.4 or 2.5 Mhz.  While I don't doubt that for some the $500.00 upgrade is needed, for most of us it is not.  By the time most programs (games) require 512VRAM the notebook would probably be outdated processor wise.  Added with the fact that Intel charges Apple about $75 for the upgraded chip it seems odd that Apple could slap us with $500.00.At the end I bough my MacBook Pro 2.4Mhz Glossy and LOVE IT.  I also took the apple salesman advice, \"you could always buy an external matted screen if you need to.\"  External matted screens are generally less expensive then their glossy counterparts.

Suddreth \"Opinion Expert\"", "ReviewID": "RT5WPAUHDMJD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased my first Apple product in over 20 years - a brand new \"old\" model (non new unibody) MacBook Pro 15 inch which was on sale with rebates, as Apple is flushing inventory to make room for their new unibody models.  My computer was the 15 inch version, 2.5GHz, 250GB Hard Drive, NVidia 8600 512k graphics, with the Glossy screen and 2GB of Ram.  I did upgrade the RAM to 4GB for a grand total of $60 and 5 minutes of my time.This computer is MARVELOUS.  It is unlike any other laptop I have ever seen in so many ways.  No fans to over heat under the case - you can sit this laptop on your - lap - without worry.  Extremely thin design.  The body is made of aluminum and is apparently used as some type of heat sink.  Screen is CRYSTAL clear.  Speed is ASTOUNDING for such a small laptop - equal to one of our servers at work.I installed Parallels virtualization software, and installed my existing version of Windows XP Professional and Office 2007 on it.  It boots this virtualized machine and runs office FASTER than my previous DELL which had a 1.8 GHz Dual core processor, running them natively.  And this from within the Mac OS 10.5 Leopard operating system.I also purchased a pair for Shure SE310 earphones for AMAZING listening enjoyment, a Corsair 32GB USB Flash Drive, and a Western Digital My Passport Studio 400GB external hard drive for high speed Firewire 800 time machine backups and auxillary storage.  All of which worked perfectly right out of the box.  Just plug in and go.If I had to make ANY complaints (when I don't really have anything to complain about), I would mention only 2 things.  First the Airport built in Lan adapter seems to have somewhat weak reception.  I am sitting in my living room about 12 feet away from my wireless hub as I type this - and I am receiving only about 60% signal strength.  This is sub standard when compared to my Dell Laptop which would show well over 95% in this same position.  The other thing I notice compared to my dell is that the built in external speakers are - underpowered - to say the least.  Full volume on this computer would be equal to less than half volume on the Dell.  Neither of these is a large issue.  The airport extreme card does seem to allow me to move all over the house without losing signal - it just seems to fall off from strong to medium rather quickly.  From the external speaker point of view - buy a set of Shure SE310 earphones, or maybe a set of Klipsch Image X10's if you prefer - and you will never want to listen to external speakers again anyway.All in all - a 5 star computer.  Excellent product Apple!  Can't wait for you to price cut the 17 inch models with the release of the 17 inch unibody at Macworld.

While playing a game, the video card died, right after my warranty expired. And lucky for me, the laptops parts are no longer made so it sits as a coaster on my coffee table. Recently I've used a Apple iBook until my principal was able to buy a few MacBook Pros. I quickly traded in my iBook for this thing of beauty. I never looked back!I'm amazed at how fast this computer loads and works. The OS called Leopard is very stable and easy to use. I've found that Macs are very user friendly. The screen is very bright (you can adjust this) and a nice addition is the fact that the keypad area is lit. The speakers on the side seem very powerful for a laptop and the superdrive being in the front instead on the right side is a nice touch. The 15 inch screen is perfect.  I've seen iLife '08 take a beating by reviewers and by keynote speakers when I go to professional development. iMovie on this laptop (part of iLife '08) is a little more confusing than the previous version. I love my iTunes though. The wireless card sometimes acts a little quirky at my job trying to hook on to the network but I am chalking this up as our network issues (we got quite a few issues with it) and I dont blame this laptop. When I go home, it does a great job detecting wireless networks.If you need a laptop strictly for work, this is a great laptop. The only minus, is that it gets very hot sometimes. Sometimes it gets extremely hot when charging. Ive notified Apple concerning this and they said it's normal however, if you feel the heat you will quickly remove your hand and say, \"Ouch!\" I cant see that as normal but so far so good.

The case is aluminum, and therefore conducts heat amazingly well.  When running vmware inside the Mac OSx, the computer will become incredibly hot. Second thing that I personally find rather disappointing is the web based multimedia capabilities out of the box...quicktime just isn't up to par with Windows Media Player.

Combined with the Intel processors, this is a wonderful performer.The GOOD:Speed.Stability of OS X.Lots of great features in operating system.Easy migration of info, docs and files from older Mac OS X-run machines.Vibrant 15\" screen.Backlit keyboard works great in dimly lighted rooms.Built-in speakers have better placement.Large storage capacity (200 GB for this particular model).Multiple ports (USB/FireWire 400 + 800/Express).DVI monitor connector.MagSafe charger port.Decent battery life for a larger laptop.Easy wireless setup and connectivity.Beautiful, sleek styling.The NOT SO GREAT:Feels a little heavier than other laptops in its class. Not a big deal.Still not crazy about Apple Mail, the e-mail client in OS X.One thing I did find--a very minor OS X system glitch--was my \"Movies\" folder was not recognized (I received an error message that read something like \"...volume cannot be found\") when I booted for the first time after setup. I have heard this happening to others, but this was an easy fix that I discovered within seconds:1.) From the launch tray at the bottom of the screen, select the Finder. It will open in a separate window.1.) On the left side of the Finder window under the PLACES menu, select your home icon (looks like a little house). In the right window pane you should see these folders with mini icons in the middle of them: Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Library, Movies, Music, Pictures. If you don't see one or more of these folders, move on to #3 below.3.) Go to the menu at the top of your screen and select File > New Folder. A blank folder (no icon) labeled \"untitled folder\". You will want to rename this folder with the name of the folder that is missing from the list above. In my particular case I was missing the \"Movies\" folder, so I renamed it that. As soon as that happened, the Movies icon appeared in the center of the folder and...PROBLEM SOLVED!BOTTOM LINE:The Mac OS X operating system combined with a magnificently built machine equates to a speedy, reliable and slick laptop that is perfect for portable media work. This is well worth the money and based on my last 20 years of Macintosh experiences, it will be a machine that will give great service.", "Date": "May 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "MacBook Pro is great.", "Author": "Yang Wang", "ReviewID": "RZ0349JUZW88O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this MacBook Pro (2.4 GHZ, 200 GB disk space) for one month.

It still works great.All of the PCs my family has owned have gotten very slow and freeze or crash constantly within a year or two. This has not slowed down at all and it has rarely frozen (once in a while there will be an issue when I'm using Corel Painter X, but I assume that's the software's fault). There have been maybe two or three times when I've gotten a message on screen that said I needed to restart because Mac OSX failed unexpectedly, but it's so rare, that it's not that big of a deal.I have Final Cut Studio, Logic Studio, and other programs loaded on my computer and they work great (especially considering this is a laptop). It's great to be able to record bands in the basement and just carry my laptop down there instead of needing a separate computer.One thing I don't like, maybe the only thing, is the noise the DVD drive makes when I put a CD/DVD in.

I LOVE this computer, but I'm glad I got this model rather than the new one and I'll explain why.1.  I love the all-silver look of it.  I don't like the black keys of the new ones.  Makes it look too much like an HP or some other kind of PC laptop.2.  I don't care for the new keyboards which have individually separated keys.  It just feels odd to type on, and the keys on this model are crisp and always feel brand new.  I love how it looks when the keys light up.3.  Matte display.  Glass screens really interfere when working with color-intensive programs.  And, as this is a portable, lighting conditions are going to constantly change.  I'd rather have no possibility of glare than have to always angle the whole computer just to get a good view.4.  DVI output rather than the new Macbook's specialized monitor connection.  Admittedly I haven't needed to hook my Mac up to anyone else's monitor yet, but if I do, I'd rather have the flexibility of a DVI cable than have to shell out more money for an adapter.5.  Firewire 400 AND 800.  The new Macbooks don't have the 400 port, which hasn't been much of an issue for me since my video camera has an 800 connector, but it's certainly within the realm of possibility that I might need to use the 400 port at some point.  This is, after all, a notebook for professionals, and I do a lot of video editing on Final Cut Pro.6.  The trackpad on this one still has a button to use.  The new ones are one single combination of trackpad and button, which sounds neat but sometimes you need the definite separation to avoid accidentally clicking something.  I guess that's why the new trackpads are larger, but still, I prefer the this version of it.The new Macbook does make some things easier, such as gaining access to the hard drive, but it doesn't make up for the smarter design of this version.  I got this computer just before they discontinued it and boy am I glad I snagged it!  There are so many neat options to play with and of course it's a big plus to have Windows running on it too.  Just add an external hard drive, and you have a computer that should easily replace any you might already have for daily home and/or professional use.

Quite frankly, for $2000 I would expect nothing less!My problem is with the OS.  It supposedly has a reputation for not crashing, yet it crashed twice the first day I got it while trying to use Open Office (a program I used on my PC regularly with no problems).  Additionally, I've had problems with the Finder- I would click on \"Go\" - \"Applications\" or another menu choice, and the window would appear for a nano-second and then disappear.  Very buggy.  I had to restart to get this to correct itself.Overall, the sturdiness and design is great, but I am unimpressed with the operating system.  Mac people have the perception that Windows crashes all the time, and that has not been my experience at all, and I'm actually having more trouble with Leopard than I have ever had with Windows.That said, with the fact that no other company offers a laptop option that is as attractive in design as Apple, this was really my only choice, and I do not regret it.  It has been worth the minor inconvenience I've had so far and I must admit some aspects of the OS are pretty cool, such as the stacks feature.  Hopefully it stops getting buggy on me!UPDATE:Haha, two days after I wrote this review the backlighting on the screen broke and I had to return it.  I went back to PC and have been on my Sony Vaio ever since.  I bought a second one for my business a few months later and both have been running strong without a problem.

Better tech support than some of the larger sellers like Dell, Lenovo and HP.  Smaller target from worm/virus attacks compared to Windows (this doesn't make Mac more secure, by the way).  Better multimedia apps which are already part of the OS.  Nice and hip design.  I can see why so many people gravitate toward Apple products these days.  Personally, though, I can't justify the extra cost for having a \"cool\" laptop.

I also don't like the old-fashioned matte screen, having been spoiled by my Acer's slick sharp screen.

This model is by far the best value out of the entire macbook pro line.  I hate the glossy screen, and the price for the 2.6 chip or the 17\" vs the benefits of these upgrades, wasn't worth it to me.  Overall the hardware and design is solid.Software -This would be my biggest complaint.  As a Java developer I can't recommend mac os vs using linux especially polished distros like fedora, or ubuntu. Why ? well they only support java 5 32 bit and 64 bit, and only java 6 64 bit. For example most gui applications on the mac need to be paid for, when in linux most can be downloaded for free.  Now weather or not you care for the polish or the fancy graphics is a different concern.  I'm looking just overall quality and choice of software.  To make the os actually usable, you have to use several 3rd party software solutions.  Example Finder is the worse implementation of a file manager I have ever seen... thats why Path Finder is so popular. Expose is a terrible alternative to finding programs.  Just compare the actions taken looking for applications when using task bar vs expose. Skip the graphics and make it useful.  When having 15 - 20 applications open expose becomes unusable.  I think the keyboard layout of mac is terrible.  Just do a comparison on cut and paste.  When pressing command or apple button + c .. your hand is curled and awkward VS .. ctrl + c .. your hand is extended, and can reach other keys easily.  Just something as simple as that.. makes a big difference to me.  Now people say just use linux or windows .. in separate partition... well I payed the apple tax to be able to use mac os.Overall comparable hardware can be bought cheaper when deals come along, and can save about 500.

My next computer is going to be a PC...", "Date": "September 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hopefully Apple will treat me right!  1 star for now... more stars later?", "Author": "S. C.

This is my first Apple and I am replacing a Toshiba Satellite that has done me justice for these past 7 years.  I guess I can say my first 1 HOUR experience with this Apple was not so cozy.  The screen had troubles.  The brightness basically did not come to life... it never reached a brightness that I could see the menues on the screen completely.  Tried everything, brightness control, restart, everything the manual instructed.  I called Apple tech support, and the lady on the phone simply was short and unhelpful to me and left me with a unpositive experience (mind you I was open for suggestions and help because I reallllly wanted to get this cool computer to work).  So I took it back to the reseller and hopefully they do me justice...  they need to make sure they get an \"RA\" number from Apple before they can do anything.  Luckily, the second Apple tech support person I called from the reseller was a little more helpful but the computer still was broken out of the box.  So, the ball is in Apple's court I guess.  I hope that Apple will do the right thing and give an \"RA\" to the reseller and  just replace this computer with a \"new\" one.  So, this review will be completed at a later date, either with a Macbook Pro in hand or another brand i.e. Toshiba.", "Date": "May 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Back in the fold", "Author": "G.

I used to have IBM thnkpad T-series notebook (now Lenovo) and it was great compare to this Mac in terms of reliability. I can carry the IBM thinkpad to work in the morning and bring it back to home in the evening without power down for SEVERAL weeks, there was no issue at all. I thought I was little rough to the thinkpad so I power down this Mac everyday after the work, carefully carry it around, well, when it happens, it happens, all the sudden, it dies. I'm in the process to recover the data, I'm mad. I'll update the review later for the service experience, so far not very good either.Another issus is you can't fold down the screen compeletedly outwards, it will break it. Bad design, image accidentaly you push down the screen for better view angle and you could break it and that's not covered by warranties.Regardless how great the MacBook is, it's a great pain when your working computer dies, you need get it repaired, resintall the application, recover the data if possible, and re-do all your work if data is lost, what about the photos you took for the special moment yesterday that haven't upload yet... too bad.No, I don't want anything fancy, I just need a reliable PC to do my things (paper, dissertation, spreadsheet, make movies), which all PCs on the market can do.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Piece of garbage!!", "Author": "RonSantoRules", "ReviewID": "R15FD3HHT3XL9A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What's nice is paying $2,000 for a new computer, only to have the hard drive fail after 6 months.
