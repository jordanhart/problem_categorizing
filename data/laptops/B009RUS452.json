{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A review from a mostly satisfied owner", "Author": "K. Jancaitis", "ReviewID": "RKKGYPJWFN2CP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer (S56CA-WH31) for my son to use at college, and have been configuring it for him for the past couple of days.  Here are a few of my impressions so far:The overall construction is very good except for one issue - the DVD tray extends out from the side of the laptop by about 1 mm.  One on-line reviewer noticed that the fit of the DVD tray was off in his review model also, but I am surprised that this got through into the production models.  It is not a big issue, but it definitely detracts from the look of the aluminum body.The screen is bright and clear and has good viewing angles.  The keyboard is nice and big and works well with my hunt and peck.  The large scroll pad is nice, and I am liking the imbedded buttons more than I thought I would.The operating system is Windows 8 core (not pro).  There is an ASUS-branded software DVD player, so I didn't have to upgrade to pro to get the windows media pack for DVD play as I feared I might have to.  There is no utility to create recovery DVD's even though the paper manual refers to one called AI recovery.  There is a Bluetooth module, so the \"reviewer\" who says that there isn't one is wrong.The 500 GB hard drive is partitioned into a number of system and recovery partitions and a C: system partition of about 186 GB along with a D: data \"drive\" of about 258 GB.  I used the Windows 8 disk manager to first remove the D: partition, expand the system \"drive\" to around 400 GB, and then used the rest of the space for a 39 GB D: drive just in case the recovery software expects to find the D: drive there.I installed Start8 from Stardock to get a start menu back on the desktop, and have ordered a 4GB SODIMM to expand the memory up to 8 GB ($25) - I figured more memory would be useful especially with the imbedded HD-4000 graphics.I don't know what the reviewer who was complaining that this was a \"slow\" computer was talking about.  It has a windows experience score of 4.8, which is not bad for an I-3 without turbo-boost and with imbedded graphics.  It won't play highly graphics intensive games, but that's not what I bought it for, not should you expect it from the online specs.Hope this is good enough for an initial review.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good for casual user, better for advanced users. Great price.", "Author": "M. McFall \"Yay interwebs\"", "ReviewID": "R3K9EZV85E4CX9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, this is a decent to good Ultrabook, providing fantastic value at the price point the i3 version is being offered for ($500 at time of purchase).  I'd rate it at 3.5 stars.  It's a handsome looking notebook and I bought this to replace a tiny netbook my wife had been using; the price of this Ultrabook is only a couple hundred more than a difficult to use small, brand new netbook, while having good functionality (good luck typing on a fancy, more expensive tablet, or sub 11\" notebook), more processing grunt than tablets and most netbooks, all within a slim, relatively lightweight profile that is suitable for travel.There are a lot of pros and cons to this ultrabook, but some of are non issues to casual users, while others make this ultrabook better suited to advanced users (or advanced users who set it up for a casual user).OUT OF THE BOX:The quality and appearance is great.  The aluminum body and top lid are very sleek looking.  The darker brushed aluminum on the top does tend to discolor and pick up fingerprints with ease.  It's not terribly heavy and while the base is very sturdily built, the screen lid feels a bit flimsy.  The top lid appears to be a combination of flimsier plastic, with a very thin brushed aluminum overlay.  Lightly pressing on parts of the lid causes the LCD screen to have fluctuations.  Despite the notebook being light, you'll want to resist picking up the notebook by the lid/screen, as it may risk damaging the LCD.LCD QUALITY:The glossy screen is clear, but has very poor viewing angles.  1366 x 768 resolution is merely adequate.  Minor backlight bleeding on right and left edges.  Colors are bright, vibrant, with a lot of contrast, but actual gamut (range of natural colors it can reproduce) is only average.  This isn't a graphics workstation replacement nor intended for photographers/graphic artists who will be using this notebook for producing color perfect prints, so it's mostly a non issue.TOUCHPAD:The large touchpad seems to have fairly high dpi sensitivity, which is a very good thing.  Swiping and navigating with the touchpad is fairly smooth, although I did experience an occasional stutters.  Two and Three finger multitouch work as advertised.  There is an easy to understand short manual showing users how to take advantage of the touchpad features.  One of the nicer ones is to swipe in from the right edge to bring up the Windows 8 \"Charms\" bar.KEYBOARD:I'm a big fan of island style keyboards and having a full numpad.  Keyboard feels very good to use and will have no problems for users who need to do a lot of typing and numerical input with it.SPEAKERS:The speakers are pretty unique and are actually integrated into the laptop's battery and produce a fantastic range of sound for a laptop.  Among the best I've heard.  UPDATE:  Apparently, they're in the laptop.  The battery has a faux speaker cover looking applique.CPU+GRAPHICS:The i3 provides a nice balance between power consumption and speed.  The i3 is not slow by any means and the Intel integrated graphics aren't either.  While you won't be able to play the newest games on high settings on this, many games are completely playable at low-mid settings.  1080p videos play flawlessly (when output to a higher resolution screen).  The Intel integrated graphics share graphics memory with the computer-- if you add another 4GB of RAM (~$25), you can, through the BIOS settings, increase total graphics memory allocation to 512MB.  I was able to play Shogun 2: Total War on decent quality settings after a small memory upgrade.  The graphics power is around that of the Nvidia GT 610M or GT 630M (with max 512mb memory allocation).HARD DRIVE:This ultrabook has an integrated 24GB mSATA SSD (short type) on the motherboard and a 500GB 5400 rpm secondary hard drive, where both operate in tandem as a hybrid HDD (via Intel IRST).  This provides relatively quick boot up and loading of most programs, but the 5400rpm hard drive a big crutch and despite any marketing, these 5400rpm drives are always a crutch and I've had a bit of slowdown on this notebook solely due to the 5400rpm drive.  I swapped it out for an SSD, but it was a lot of work, which I'll get into later.  This Ultrabook operates much faster and more reliably with an SSD in place of the 5400rpm mechanical drive.INTEGRATED PERIPHERALS:A nice amount of ports, USB 2.0 and 3.0 work at advertised speeds, HDMI and VGA out is nice, although I do wish it had an eSATA port.  The camera is not very good and produced a very grainy picture.  It's a typical low end webcam.  Bluetooth, which was included in my model, has adequate range.  I am surprised that a DVD drive can fit in this form factor, squeezing one in might have resulted in some QC issues with mine-- the eject DVD button works strangely, requiring a abnormally hard button press to get the DVD tray to eject.  The DVD drive motor is also incredibly loud.  DC Power jack seems pretty reinforced and feels like it won't be the first thing to go, as opposed to some of the other laptops I've owned.BATTERY:I get close to 5 hours with regular use which is more than adequate, considering how slim the battery is.  Not as high as other ultrabooks, but this ultrabook is also less expensive.BLOATWARE:Not too heavy on bloatware, as compared with other manufacturers.  Only had about 6 unnecessary programs to remove, albeit some of the Asus apps may be useful for the casual user (as they can provide easy file swapping options for connecting smartphones, working with the webcam, and setting up power options).ADVANCED USERS/UPGRADES:RAM is pretty easy to add another 4 GB.  I also do like that it is just one single panel to remove (2 screws) to access both the HDD and the extra RAM slot.  If you want to remove both sticks, you will need to remove the entire bottom cover/enclosure (about 16 screws).  The BIOS is very lacking in options, which is unusual for Asus.  There are no options to remove the Asus boot logo, nor are there options to select which boot device to use.  It doesn't appear that this ultrabook allows booting from a USB thumbdrive, as I tried several bootable thumbdrives when I was trying a clean install, each time met with failure.  It does allow booting from DVD, but I would feel better knowing I could boot from USB in case of DVD drive failure.  Additionally, regarding the BIOS, this uses Secure Boot and an SLIC BIOS, which for the layman, automatically loads licensing data and prevents \"unsigned\" bootable DVDs and thumbdrives from loading/booting. This is why the laptop has no Windows License sticker. This was a big issue for me as I tried doing a clean install of Windows 8 Pro, but the SLIC BIOS automatically kept loading up the manufacturer keys for Win 8 Standard OEM during install, preventing me from using my own Windows 8 license.  I was ultimately able to do a clean install Win 8 Pro, but it required some very hacky methods and backwards logic that I'll detail in the comments.Replacing the slow 500GB HDD with an SSD and installing an OS on it is a little tricky due to the integrated onboard mSATA SSD.  If you're doing a clean install you'll have to reinitialize the mSATA SSD to restore the Intel IRST functions (Fast Boot, Fast Resume, Instant On, etc).  You can also liberate and get full use of the onboard 24GB mSATA SSD as a conventional drive, alongside your own drive by deleting the GPT partitions and creating new volumes...but I recommend making a backup of all factory partitions+data from the 24GB mSATA SSD so you can return the laptop to factory settings, if necessary.  The 24GB mSATA SSD is removeable, but it uses a short card; the longer, larger capacity standard size mSATA SSD cards, while they will fit, have no screw standoff to secure it.  I'll be adding a laptop screw standoff so I can swap the 24GB integrated mSATA SSD with a 128GB mSATA SSD.  Or you can completely remove the mSATA SSD and just have a single drive notebook.  The wireless network card can be removed, but there may be a hardware lock that prevents other wireless network cards from working on the motherboard.  For now, I'm happy with the Atheros card that's in there, as it's compatible with some penetration testing software I have.  There's a limited amount of tinkering that can be done on this Ultrabook, and I do feel some is necessary to get the most out of this notebook (replace HDD with SSD).Despite some of its flaws, the underlying common denominator that makes this worthy of a purchase is it's price.  You get a lot of Ultrabook for not too much money.  With some tweaks, such as replacing the HDD, and maybe reintigrating the Start button via the $4.99 Stardock Start 8 program, it can be a great Ultrabook for casual and advanced users alike.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Ultrabook for the Price *See Updates*", "Author": "Alexander Duplessie", "ReviewID": "R1MIE9ZXCJOME", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*UPDATE AFTER SSD PURCHASE*Upgrading the internal HDD to a 240GB SSD has fixed all of the problems I mentioned in my previous update.  The computer now runs incredibly fast.I will add, however, that trying to reinstall Windows 8 with the same product key was impossible except by using an unmodified x64 iso of Windows 8.  For some reason, I could not download the iso from Microsoft and had to find it elsewhere.  After finally getting the proper iso, the reinstall was a breeze, and the OEM product key was entered in automatically (make sure you have secure boot enabled).  I also formatted the internal 24GB SSD and now use it to store my internet browser's cache to extend the life of my 2.5\" SSD.  Not having the Intel Rapid Start or Asus Instant On features has not created any noticeable affect on performance or resume speeds.*UPDATE AFTER 2 WEEKS OF USE*Do NOT buy this laptop if you don't intend to upgrade the internal Hard Drive to an SSD. The performance of the internal HDD bottlenecks the entire computer.  I cannot listen to a 320kbps mp3 while browsing the internet without it skipping/stuttering, and I cannot listen to a FLAC file doing nothing else without it skipping.  I also cannot watch an SD .avi file without it skipping/stuttering at least 10 times during a 40 minute TV show, and I cannot play Worms: Reloaded (a very simple game that this computer should be able to handle) without it locking up for a second or two EVERY 3 SECONDS.  Either the internal HDD is EXTREMELY slow (my guess because my RAM and CPU usage are always well below 100%, and it's not just video but also audio that skips) or my unit is defective in some other way.  The HDD indicator light is pretty much constantly on when I try to do any of the previously mentioned tasks as well.  I will be ordering a 240GB SSD within the next month to see if that fixes the problem.  Otherwise I will be sending the unit in to Asus. If you need a working laptop for under $500, don't get this.  I'm going to be spending at least $200 on this laptop within the next few months (SSD and 8GB more RAM).If the SSD upgrade fixes the problems, I would rate this at 4 stars again, but these issues bring it down to 2 for now.----------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:This is a review for the Core i3 with 4GB of RAM.PROS:-Great keyboard w/ numpad, touchpad, and overall build quality with ample ports.-Large, glossy screen and great audio quality on built in speakers.-Snappy performance with Windows 8 on the internal SSD-Laptop stays cool under load.-Instant On resumes the OS very quickly.-Latest 22nm version of the Intel CPU/GPU chipset (a lot of Ultrabooks in this price range are using the older 32nm architecture)-ASUS Gesture makes Windows 8 a breeze on a non-touchscreen device.CONS:-Battery life is a bit lacking with the 4-cell battery (around 5 hours) BUT it also charges insanely fast (faster than my cell phone)-LCD quality could be better; although it is perfectly adequate for a student or casual user. The viewing angles are limited and the color range is not the greatest. Tweaking the graphics settings helps quite a bit, but if the screen quality is the most important thing in a laptop to you, you probably won't be happy.-The back is a fingerprint magnet, but that's nothing a little Windex can't help.-DVD drive sticks out a NEGLIGENT amount on the backside. It's less than 1mm for me, and the front is flush. I've seen people complaining about it, but don't see it as being a huge deal.-The speakers are on the bottom, so when the laptop is sitting on a bed, sound is a bit muffled but still loud enough.-Grainy webcamAs a student, this laptop suits me very well. It's got enough battery life to make it through a day of classes without charging, and it's extremely light due to the stylish and thin aluminum design.  Sound quality is great, and the display is adequate for mobile use (I'll do my Photoshopping at home on my desktop though).  The processor is very fast as well. I've always been an AMD user except for an eeePC that had an Intel Atom.  I'm very happy with the speeds of the i3; in comparison to my desktop's Phenom II X3 2.8Ghz the i3 transcoded an album from FLAC to V0 in 160% of the time it took the Phenom.  Not bad at all.  I've yet to do any gaming yet on this laptop, but I have a feeling with a total 6-8GB of RAM the Ultrabook would have no problem playing many recent games on low-medium settings.  As far as video, the HD 4000 graphics provide a perfect HD media streaming experience.  The webcam, however, is mediocre at best with a grainy, but decently high resolution image.As far as future modifications, I intend to purchase a 128GB SSD to replace the internal HDD as well as pick up another 4GB of RAM.  A freshly booted system configured to my liking (Rocketdock & Rainmeter) uses 66% of the internal 4GB due to the onboard GPU.  I also would consider buying a larger battery if offered and if it's the same dimensions as the stock one.  These are all things that are unnecessary due to the incredible price of this Ultrabook ($439.99 after rebate for me), but they will unlock this device's full potential.In the end, I am very happy with my purchase; although I could have gotten a more expensive Ultrabook with more power, this packs a great punch for the price.  It will be more than adequate for my internet browsing, mobile music production, word processing, media streaming, and casual gaming. Plus it makes a great fashion statement because it looks even sexier than a Mac ;)", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Fantastic Linux Laptop", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R3Q48D768JUUQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd like to start out by saying that the majority of the grievances spelled out by other individuals typically revolve around the software. That is, Windows 8 and the suite of Asus prepacked crap.And they're not wrong. It truly is horrendous. Windows 8 was a massive misstep by Microsoft and Asus' bundleware doesn't exactly enhance the experience.SCREW WINDOWS 8:Fortunately this was destined to be a Linux laptop, specifically Fedora 19 ([...] I'll be using it as a software engineering student starting in the fall and this is looking to shape up to be a wonderful Linux laptop. It is fairly standard hardware and appears to be well supported (ethernet, WLAN, bluetooth, power management, webcam, etc.). I have also heard reports that it works well with the Debian based distros as well as the more \"server-esque\" distros such as CentOS and Arch Linux. The diagnostics done on this laptop were through Hiren's Boot CD which recognized all of the hardware just fine.BIOS CONFIGURATION:The first thing done was to update the laptop's BIOS to the latest version (208 as of writing this. Was 206). This, and morbid curiosity, was the only reason I booted into Windows 8 in the first place as using Asus' Windows based flash utility is the easiest way to get this done. Doing this did flip SecureBoot to enabled (it was actually disabled by default in 206). Just go back into the BIOS and disable it again. If you can't boot from CD be sure that \"Launch CSM\" is enabled under boot options in the BIOS and that the DVD drive is set to have boot priority over the Windows boot loader. If you intend to do a PXE installation you can enable that as well. Otherwise you can ignore it.HARD DRIVES:Both the 500GB hard drive and the 24GB SSD survived an extended test in GSmartControl with zero errors. The SSD benchmarked a read/write of 4.2GB/s and 344MB/s, very respectable.The drives were immediately zeroed and given the following partitioning scheme:/dev/sda1  swap (encrypt)  4GB/dev/sda2  /boot  ext4  500MB/dev/sda3  /  ext4 (encrypt)  19.5GB/dev/sdb1  /home  ext4 (encrypt)  500GBThis gives the OS, swap and applications the entire SSD and reserves the slow hard drive for data (office and Eclipse workspaces, mostly). Disk encryption works fine and as expected. Boot and application load times are snappy and responsive.RAM:I purchased an extra 4GB of RAM to go with this unit (B006EWUP4Y ) which was an easy install. Simply take out two screws, slide off a back panel and snap the module in. Numerous YouTube videos can be found demonstrating this. Both the laptop memory and the purchased memory survived six runs (10+ hours) of Memtest86 without issue ([...] I onlyGRAPHICS:The Intel HD4000 graphics is more than enough for HD video and some basic gaming (hey, Steam is on Linux these days!). If you install more RAM into the laptop you can feel free to up the available memory for the graphics to 512MB via the BIOS (the default is a miserly 64MB so you may want to up it regardless). Games such as Portal and Bastion boot up and play fine. In fact, they load surprisingly fast considering that I have my Steam games installed to the HDD.TEMPERATURES:~41C-45C while idle or internet browsing. Prime95 brought the temps up to approx. 61C. Not too bad.MISC:Yes, the webcam is as grainy as others have reported. If this is an issue for you, avoid this unit. If not, then...feh? The ethernet, wireless and bluetooth work at the advertised speeds. The inclusion of a DVD drive is nice for those of us who cannot let go. The screen is large and bright.The summary is - the hardware will do its job quite well. The issue is with Windows 8 and Asus' bundleware. If you can I would suggest downgrading to Windows 7 or dropping an alternative OS under the hood. With the right configuration this is an absolutely wonderful piece of hardware at an unbelievable price.", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent for sub $500 laptop.", "Author": "Johnnie B", "ReviewID": "R5ZANLYD4ZQ41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a laptop that's attractive, reliable, at least i3 processor and under $500.  Amazon had a gold box deal on the Dell 15N and, while it met my minimum qualifications, it was somewhat of a dud.  The thick plastic body and the cheap feel of the keyboard was disappointing but I would have kept it for just over $300 I paid if it weren't for the wi-fi connection issues.  I returned to Amazon and was credited fully right away.  Personally I feel that there's no better retailer than Amazon right now.As soon as I got my credit for the Dell return, this laptop goes on gold box deal.  Talk about good fortune.  This laptop that qualifies as an ultrabook (barely) is easily 5 stars for the price I paid.  Not many people can say that they paid just over $400 for an ultrabook.Performance is commendable.  Even though I'm a casual user and don't do much that is graphics or processor intensive, I have yet to see any slowness of my applications and, with the hybrid HD setup, is the fastest booting computer I ever owned.Reliability is top notch.  Not a single hiccup detected at nearly a month's use.  You also get the Asus warranty including accidental drop/spill damage protection.Full of features including Bluetooth, HDMI out, USB 3.0 and an optical drive that not all ultrabooks have.  Drive tray does stick out by a sliver when closed and isn't completely flush as some other reviewers noted but I wouldn't even have noticed if I hadn't read that on others' posts.Sounds great.  Best sounding laptop I ever owned.  The speakers are down firing so having this on a flat surface is best for listening.Excellent design.  At .83\" and 4.6 lbs, it is thin and light and I am a big fan of the brushed metal look of the aluminum body.  Yes, it does leave finger prints but what laptop doesn't?Decent battery life.  Was able to squeeze 5hrs.  Not the best but good for having 4 cell battery.The keyboard, while not backlit, is nice and feels well built.  Touchpad is responsive but is big, bigger than other laptops I owned so it took a little getting use to.The screen is average.  Like most mid level laptop screens it has good color and contrast with a little backlight bleed at the corners and short viewing angles.  It definitely is not an Apple Retina Display.Win8.  Some hate, some like and some get use to.  I got use to it.  Works fine for my needs.  Just glad that it came with minimal bloatware.The 500gb HDD is 5400 rpm not 7200 as stated in some places but it fits my needs.  Swapping it out for a SSD would improve performance no doubt but I really don't have the need to invest in that.  I did put a $25 4gb RAM in the open slot and that will be the extent of my hardware upgrades.Some states that the cooling fan is very loud.  I have yet to notice after 3+ weeks of use and is quiet as a whisper.  Will update post if it starts doing so.This computer looks, feels and sounds great.

I figure I will list the things I love about it and then a few things that are tiny that slightly annoy me.Pros:The cost.  I payed $400 for an ultrabook, with a CD drive, that has a 15.6 inch screen.  The fact that I was able to get such a piece of equipment for such a small price is amazing.Screen size.  I cannot tell you how un-nerved I've become as the laptops have become smaller and smaller.  For someone with fingers like mine and eye sight that can at best be described as mediocore, the size of the screen is a real plus.The keyboard. The letters are raised and set off from below by an aluminum colored base.  Then there is a number pad which is incredibly handy when inputting numbers quickly into a spread sheet.The Speaker. I cannot tell you how many Ultrabooks I have looked at that have placed the speakers at the bottom of the laptop.  The idea of placing speakers on the part that is sitting on  your lap or desk makes no sense.  The speaker is front and center which makes listening easy and enjoyable.Windows 8. At first, it was a bit annoying, as is trying to understand any new piece of software.  But after messing with it for a few hours, and getting everything as I wanted, it is incredibly simple.  Everything you need is on the window screen.Compatibility.  I love using Google Chrome.  It was very simple to synch everything that I do on google with the Windows 8 operating screen.  My calender, my bookmarks, and my contacts were brought over for me.The charge. I fully charged it when I received it and then used it until the battery was at 1%.  The time, 4 hours and 43 minutes.  That's not just sitting there, that's actual work time which is amazing.Quick Start. I probably shut my computer down and restarted it 4 times just to show everyone how quick it actually was.THE CONS- (which are just a few minor things)The disk drive. I read that it does stick out a little and it does which to me just dosent make that much sense but doesnt change my view on the laptop.The case. It is highly susceptible to fingerprints.  I mean highly, but are easily taken away with a computer cloth.The mouse pad. It can be jumpy sometimes and overly sensitive which can be taken care within the system but sometimes it gets a mind of its own.The pre-loads.  As with any laptop you are going to have a bunch of crap that you dont need.  It's a pain to uninstall them.OVERALL:I am incredibly happy with my purchase.  The computer is amazing.

This upgrade is essential on this model! There is NO dedicated video card onboard. This system uses Intel integrated graphics HD 4000. Asus should not even make the -wh31.These 1 and 2 star reviews really cheese me off.First, This is a laptop that Asus has put in their Ultrabook category. There is no standard definition for such word. Look at the dimensions before you buy if you're going to complain about the size...Secondly, I got 4 hours and 10 minutes off a single charge of active use (typing, games, movies) with dimmed screen and airplane mode on. This is one of the BEST value of i5 laptop computers out there right now. You get quite a bit of hardware for <5lb machine. I will stipulate that this is a 720p definition screen and not 1080p. I would assume this is another balancing act for price and performance. Having a 1080p screen would dump more on the integrated graphics, CPU, RAM, and battery life. Those higher definition movies would take up more Hard drive space too...Asus has done some great things here. They have a full keyboard with one of the smoothest working function keys I've ever used. There is 24gb mSATA dedicated to fast boot (works great) that can be very useful if you want to install something like backtrack 5 or whatever OS utility you want. The 5400 performs as expected, but they did not gip on the space. Asus could have given a 320 or 500gb drive and 4gb RAM but they tucked value into every corner of this laptop. They also include one year of accidental damage protection (even more value)After I burn through the first battery, I'll replace the hard drive with a solid state drive and buy a new battery. I'd expect better performance and longer battery life and recommend doing this or having it done for people who do heavier mobile computing (multiple screens, GIANT spreadsheets, Adobe Suite Users)FYI I've only owned one Asus computer before this one and don't consider myself an Asus fanboy...yet", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS S56CA Ultrabook Review", "Author": "Alfred Closson", "ReviewID": "R8WNKNLR3QI1O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I rate this purchase at 4 stars and not 5 not because of the product itself but, because I had to do some work to get the Ultrabook to work. It was highly unstable in the condition it arrived.  It turns out that the OS load was faulty resulting in the Blue Screen of Death several times a day.  I updated the system to Win 8.1 hoping this would stabilize my system but, that didn't work.  I had to reload Win 8 from scratch and this resolved the problem.  If it had arrived ready to go out of the box I would rate it a 5.  That said, it is the Best Value in a notebook I have ever purchased.  Win 8 navigation takes a bit of getting used to.  Thankfully, ASUS loads some nice tools that allow you to find things your used to accessing in a format you're used to seeing it in.I upgraded to Win 8.1 after reloading Win 8 and it works fine.  The system is quick to start.  Battery life is good enough for my purposes.  And, it is light weight for it's size and configuration (HDD and Optical Drive).  The only thing I would have liked it to have is a backlit keyboard.  Speaking of keyboards, there are many complaints on the net about this keyboard.  I don't know what they are complaining about it works just fine.  Performance wise it is as fast as most anyone would need.  Keeping open numerous tabs is not an issue.

It has all the processing power and memory needed for basic operation plus some. I enjoyed the smart touch pad that allows the user to control everything from screen zoom to desktop navigation in one convenient location. I was also glad for the option to reach the desktop by simply striking the windows key and D together, as I am not a fan of the windows 8 layout. The user-friendliness and overall appearance is the only reason I chose to rate more than a single star.Keep in mind the only use this laptop received in the month I had it was to surf the web, listen to music and write papers for my college courses. When not in use I shut the system down completely and stored it in a hard case. I noticed almost immediately that whenever the system needs to install an update or configure drivers it will crash and reboot itself, and when it does be prepared to lose whatever you were working on and wait an hour or so while it does it's thing because it is completely inaccessible during this time. Speaking of crashing, you might as well get used to the fact that this laptop crashes constantly, whether it needs to install updates or not. In addition to this the \"Bluescreen\" made an appearance a week or so after initial startup until it eventually died for good. All I get when I attempt start up is a black screen with the white Windows symbol and a status bar that says \"Configuring Windows Repair\" or some such nonsense. After a half hour of this so called \"configuration\" several options pop up for a system recovery, none of which work because according to the system \"A driver needs reinstalled/repaired or is not accessible\". Needless to say, one month after purchase, I am sending it in to ASUS for repair. Thankfully product support is fairly helpful and customer friendly, unlike that of the \"Buy With Confidence\" Amazon seller who refused my return because I do not have my original packaging.In short, this is a risky buy. I have seen some great reviews from highly satisfied customers, and I have seen reviews from individuals in my same predicament. So if you make this purchase KEEP YOUR ORIGINAL PACKAGING! Just in case...Update: Asus' repair process is arduous and incompetent at best. I shipped my ultrabook to them on the third of December and as of today, the 17th, they have yet to even enter it into their computer system. So it looks like I will be writing school papers at the local library for quite some time.

I might have given it 4 stars, but was anticipating the two shortcomings described below, so knew what I was purchasing. While looking among the many choices of ASUS notebooks, I was at first tempted by the ViVoBook S500CA with the touchscreen capability, but decided that with inputs from trackpad and mouse, the additional touchscreen input seemed totally unnecessary. The trackpad is excellent, especially after mastering the \"smart gestures.\" I love the full keyboard (very similar, in feel, to the MacBook and the Apple keyboards). It's a pretty fast PC, and I will at some point upgrade RAM from the out-of-the-box 6GB to the recommended max 8GB. The sound is very good, and viewing DVDs is a nice experience. The webcam works well. Tons of hard drive (and SSD) memory, more than I will ever need, and it comes appropriately partitioned into C: and D: drives - the former for operating system files (279 GB) and the latter for data files (397 GB). The overall performance and feel of this machine are, in my view, excellent. The 15.6\" size doesn't make it as super-portable as a 13\" or 14\" model, but it still fits - just - into my computer-bag.I have spent some time disabling some of the startup programs (Windows key + X > Task Manager > select More details > select Startup tab) for much faster boot; deleting some of the ASUS apps which I will never use; setting up (adding, deleting, pinning, unpinning, sizing, arranging) and grouping/naming the Windows 8 \"metro\" tiles the way I like them; learning the really useful Windows key shortcuts; installing iTunes and customizing sound; and so on. I'm actually liking Windows 8, contrary to what many think. And I brought back the good old Windows 7 Start Button with a free download that took all of 30 seconds from start to finish... As for the two shortcomings:* Battery-life IS pretty short - maybe four hours, less if screen brightness is cranked way up. Recharge, however, is rather fast. For my general-use, medium to high-ish level purposes, this is fine. Plugging in is easy to do! Nice small brick and cords with plenty of length.* Display - 15.6\" at 1366 x 768 ISN'T the best, especially if used to superb MacBook and iPad displays, but it's fine.

It has a full keyboard with one of the smoothest working function keys I've ever used.One nice touch is that the built-in speakers have very wide tonal range and overall sound quality for a laptop. Previous laptops I have owned have had a tendency to hiss or rattle at certain frequencies. I find the volume sufficient for listening to music while I work, but I wouldn't try to listen to music in a crowded room.This unit can handle everything that I need it for, from gaming like sc2, to casual web use, so I am thrilled.Asus has done some other great things here. There is 24gb mSATA dedicated to fast boot (works great) that can be very useful if you want to install something like backtrack 5 or whatever OS utility you want. The battery life is more than adequate for what I require. After the initial charge, I got 4.5 hours from it, and that was with some youtube watching, so it was as close to \"real world\" results as I could personally get for me.In all, if you are looking for a ultra computer that is both reasonably powerful and aesthetically pleasing, I recommend this laptop heartily.

I had to use some strength to push the track pad left click and right clicks which was tiring for the fingers and was not a pleasure thing to do. The key board was really good and I really liked them comparable to mac book key board quality even though there was no back light. The screen was not solid enough and vibrates even for small movements of laptop. Most of the difficulty was with Windows 8 and its slow response on this machine especially for smart track pad gestures. Battery was below par and was not lasting for more than 3 to 4 hours. The slow machine combined with less than expected battery power caused me to change my mind and return this machine. The cost and keypad was the major pros which I felt.

It kinda resembles a Macbook Pro with it's aluminum casing and sleek design.Windows 8:Windows 8 has been an OS I have been reluctant to adopt on my desktop PC mainly because of the bad publicity.  I had considered buying a laptop with Windows 7 but I chose Windows 8.  I like it, a lot.The OS is smooth, fast, and responsive.  Not to mention the lack of the Start button is not a complete and total loss considering the fact that it is now a Start Screen.  All of your Apps or programs that matter to you can be listed on the Start Screen so they are easier to find.  The tile feature on Windows 8 is pretty slick.  Most of the tiles that have come with Windows 8 display information that you want to see at a glimpse.  These can be the weather, Stock Market info, the news, or whatever App you download from the Windows Marketplace.The scrolling is amazing and fast and the trackpad makes great use of multi-gesture capabilities of Windows 8.  Again I think they did kinda take the smooth scrolling idea from Apple but oh well.The learning curve is a challenge even if you have been using PCs for a long time, but it is worth it!What I am using this PC for:I am currently going to college for IT and we use virtual machines for our schoolwork.  The 6GB of RAM that comes with this PC should be more than enough to run VMware or Oracle Box and run other OS's to work on my schoolwork.  I am a gamer but this computer will not be used for that because of it's lack of a dedicated graphics card.Final impression:When I was researching a PC to buy I saw this one and looked for other users reviews online.  A Youtube video had this same computer booting up at less than 30 seconds.  When I tested my computers boot time it was right at 20 seconds.  I love Windows 8 but I will not upgrade my Asus Desktop (currently running Windows 7) to Windows 8 anytime soon.  Windows 7 is still a better OS for people who are afraid of Windows 8 and don't want that learning curve.  For those of you who want something better and faster and like to try new things Windows 8 may be for you.Windows 8 coupled with this laptop is a winning combination!", "Date": "March 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "wendy c kastelitz", "ReviewID": "R1J19XTA4ORI1R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "love it!

I will edit this review after i check cold boot time.  Firefox works good on it,  doesn't appear Google chrome will, which is big disappointment for me as I will miss being able to sync with my android tablets.  hopefully I can find a work around.

So to me laptops these days are pretty throttled down to just power saving Eco friendly cost efficient things that are slow.  I knew when I bought one I'd have to get other things to make it good enough for me, so I picked up 8GB of Crucial ram, a Crucial 128GB MSata SSD, and a WD 750GB Scorpio Black 7200RPM.  These things make the laptop use the same amount of power but at the same time make it much faster.  Since the mechanical drive is no longer the main hard drive the laptop actually gets 4.5hrs of battery life over the reported 4hrs, so its a modest increase.  So even though the total price ended up at $890 with all the parts and the laptop it really feels like its worth it.  Though keep in mind if you put these things in this laptop the warranty is void because you have to remove and re-glue the MSata SSD mount to support the longer drive, and before you even begin to modify the thing you must update the bios so you can put your own windows on it.  To sum it up this was a pretty good experience for me its been a long time since I even had a laptop.  I prefer custom built desktops for the power but needed something somewhat powerful I could pack around with me.  I used the laptop with it standard hardware for about 4 hours and it wasn't bad maybe even good but I knew it could be better.  So as a toy I love it!

I own an ASUS Transformer Prime tablet, and I love it, so I felt good about buying another ASUS.  The first laptop I was sent was supposed to be new, but had obviously been a previously used one.  I buy from Amazon regularly, first time that's happened to me, I'll blame it on the holiday rush.  The Amazon exchange/return process is easy if you've purchased directly from them, so it wasn't a problem to have another one shipped.For the price I really like the second, new laptop. I'll add that I did purchase an extra stick of ram, which another reviewer taught me how to find and purchase, and YouTube taught me how to install.  I think this laptop starts up really, really quickly. I know a few people have complained about the screen, but I personally think the screen is nice and vivid, and the battery life is significantly better than my HP ever thought to be.  I'm getting just under 4 hours of use, browsing the web, and using the Amazon cloud player.  The laptop is nice and light, has an included DVD/CD drive, and I think the silver casing makes it look pretty sleek. I mainly use this at home, and take my tablet out and about, so I can't attest to its physical durability.I do have 2 main complaints, the first being the speaker is on the bottom of this laptop, so sound is pretty muffled if you have it on your lap listening to music directly from the speaker.  Also, I am not a fan of windows 8.  It seems like Windows 8 was built for touch screen computers, and tablets, and this laptop is not touch screen.  It's so frustrating to find things that were so intuitive before, the scroll function is so sticky, and the jewel bar pops up constantly, urrggg!  I just followed a tip from someone else and downloaded the classic shell program from CNet, I think it will help make it more user friendly, we'll see.

Core i5 is very nice, even the low power (uLV) version is very capable and runs flawlessly. would be perfect if it had 16GB of RAM and Bluetooth (some versions of the S56CA series have the Centrino card installed).Cons:I contacted Asus customer support and I was appalled at the fact that the customer representative blatantly lied to me about the RAM capacity. The warranty policy and computer design that make it impossible to upgrade the simple and removable components of a laptop are frustrating and ridiculous (Half PCIe card for WIFI/Bluetooth upgrade not accessible, not having all available RAM slots customer accessible, and not having the mSATA card accessible). When I asked the customer representative what I can do about this (expecting to have to send/take it to a service center, which while not preferable still makes it feasible) the representative told me \"we don't allow users to upgrade any notebook parts except RAM and HDD\" and essentially told me that they don't care. When I confronted the service representative about lying about the RAM (Intel directly states a maximum RAM capacity of 32GB and I know someone directly who is currently running 16GB in the same notebook) they gave me an attitude of not caring with \"8GB has tested by asus and it is steable and safe\". I do understand that there can be an issue with customers opening up and tampering with the BIOS or other items, but to make it impossible to upgrade common parts is absurd. I had an ASUS F9Dc notebook before this and it was wonderful, but after this pain and frustration I do not believe I will buy another ASUS.Other Thoughts:I am not a personal fan of Windows 8, it works and has some nice features added but is really meant for at least a touch screen but really seems to be meant for a tablet and \"feels\" a little clunky and awkward.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Will not buy from this vendor again or nor do any future business with Amazon.com in the future", "Author": "J Kuzma", "ReviewID": "R325M4GFD13ZUD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Amazon's search engine (and they refuse to admit it) and this vendor provided an erroneous match (bait and switch) for my specific keyword search for an ASUS Touch Ultrabook and only until I opened the box and set it up, did find out it was not a Touch laptop, returned the product but was charged 20% restocking fees for an open box (I'm not sure how I would have know that the product I thought I ordered was indeed what I received unless I opened it and set it up).", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Terrible quality", "Author": "k.rusyn", "ReviewID": "R21M11Z742JON6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At least I got mine under warranty. 2 of these laptops I have had to send back.. enough said.

I have to say it's really not usable. Maybe if I HAD to have a computer right away and it was the only one around, but I can't see how someone would choose this model for full-time use. Sure, it's beautiful and sleek and shiny. The gorgeous brushed aluminum doesn't show fingerprints. The keyboard is easy to clean.The good ends there. I'm ready to throw this thing through the window.To begin, this laptop dims when on battery. It stays that way all of the time, even when you're not using the power-save mode, even when you're working on it, even when it's at 100% power, even when you have it set to its highest performance setting. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but I'm a graphic designer so that just cuts out all usability of my machine right there. At least unless it's plugged in which means I can't take it anywhere with me if there's no outlet.Secondly, this touch pad is the worst. It's not very sensitive and I have a very difficult time double-clicking. It's near impossible to highlight anything because you can't press a button and use the touch pad at the same time. The mouse buttons on the touch pad are connected to the touch pad itself, so when you press one (and you have to press HARD), it warps the entire touch pad, moving your cursor away from where you had it on the screen. This is also super irritating when you're trying to click a link. If you use the button to click the link, it often moves the cursor away from the link you're trying to click which is infuriating. Double-clicking with the touch pad doesn't seem to work very often because the sensitivity is so low, so I end up having to double-click about ten times before it takes. I can't use the button to double-click because it's so hard to push it, I can't seem to push it twice fast enough unless I'm really dedicated to it and frankly, no one is paying that much attention when working or surfing the web.I also have a lot of trouble with the touch pad seizing up. Every few minutes, it stops working. When it is working, it just loves pulling up random windows and things from all over the place. This is what happens when you put too many functions on a touch pad. It gets confused by things you didn't intend. If you accidentally brush it with another finger or your palm, it goes haywire and you have to close windows and programs.The scroll seemed nice at first but now it's just irritating. If you try to scroll up or down, the scrolling doesn't stop when your hand does. It just sort of slows down its momentum and comes to a natural stop like a toy car that has been pushed across the floor. This means you have to stop moving your hand, then grab it and pull it back up or down the other direction to get it to stop. The result is infuriating when you're page is going too far up or down and you're trying to hone in on a specific section of the page.Oh, and if you venture anywhere near the right side of your screen, you'll pull up the settings and devices menu. \"Oh, I see you're trying to click a link! Does that mean you'd like to change your devices? No? How about your computer's setting? No? Okay, well, I'll just pause for a few seconds and not let you use your touch pad at all until I'm sure. Hm...okay, so you're sure? Fine. Here. Have your cursor back. I'll wait...okay, it's been ten whole seconds! I'm sure you're ready to change your settings now! No? *sigh* Fine. I'll wait ten more seconds. Okay, now? Now? NOW NOW NOW? How about changing those settings now? I REALLY THINK YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR SETTINGS NOW!!!\"I mean, what kind of moron thought it would be so important to someone to change their setup or search their computer so often that they had to make a quick application for it that's activated simply by brushing the right-hand side of the touch pad? Who really changes their devices and settings every few minutes? I'm tired of seeing this stupid menu pop up on my screen literally every five minutes. If there's an option to turn this off, I can't seem to find it.Add to all of this the fact that this machine is slower than the $70 busted-up laptop my father bought for me used in 1998 to take to college with me. It takes forever to open menus, run programs and browse my files. I can't believe there is a computer this slow on the market. It's like living in dial-up days again.I also cannot use the computer one-handed which is a huge problem for me because I nurse a baby. I need to be able to use the function keys but they are too far from the function button to do it with one hand. The page up/page down keys are located at the top of the keyboard, so you can't rest your hand while using them which gets tiring for your hand very fast. I can't type at all because I can't turn off the touch pad one-handed so if my hand or sleeve brushes it or even, it would seem, if the computer completely imagines that I have touched it, windows and programs begin popping open, links are selected, typed text is lost and I'm ready to scream.Also, don't believe that this battery lasts 5 hours. I can get 2 hours TOPS out of it if I don't use it for anything but reading.And apparently, ASUS still hasn't gotten the memo that putting the drive ports on the sides in the front puts them entirely in the way when you are trying to use a mouse or tablet.I'll be returning it right away for a refund and getting something - anything - else.

Apparently all windows 8 laptops are required by Microsoft to have BIOS that locks the computer into ONLY being able to use windows 8. If you try to install windows 7 or another OS, the BIOS will basically kill your computer and prevent it from working properly. Windows 8 is a piece of junk and the new restrictive features means I will be staying far far away from any laptop with W8.***Update #2, apparently there is a way to install non-W8 OS on a W8 hardwared computer...but it involves jumping through a series of hoops. You need to turn off UEFI and secure boot to install Windows 7, and even then it doesn't allow you to duel boot into W8 (making the W8 OEM you just bought with the computer worthless). Furthermore, sometimes even this doesn't work, and the BIOS is hardware locked to only use Windows 8, thus forcing you to download a program to force-flash an older BIOS onto the motherboard.
