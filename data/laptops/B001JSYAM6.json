It doesn't matter if all application programs are closed and it's been 10 minutes since the last time you used it--there's still a 50% chance it'll just hang.  There are only two ways to get out of this state: 1) hold the power slide button for 10 seconds until the unit turns off, 2) unplug the power cord until the battery is low enough that it turns off. When you power it back on, all is fine (except you'll have to jump through about 6 hoops to restore your background image).Some people might find they run out of storage with only 16 GB, but netbooks are made for cloud computing.  I've had this computer over a year and haven't used up even half the space (compared to my desktop PC, where I have a 1 TB hard drive and it's nearly full).All in all, I would recommend it.  For some reason, these days it is hard to find a netbook that has SSDs instead of noisy HDDs (which have a MTBF of 6 months compared to the 100 years for SSDs) so if you can find one of these, snap it up!", "Date": "May 24, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001JSYAM6"}}
