Morrison \"TRM\"", "ReviewID": "R86H51ZJQ8FYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop at a great price...we shopped for several weeks comparing models and prices and believe this model to be a great buy.  Sams has a different model that came in second place in our comparison and it had a larger HDD but was last generation of processor and was about $75 less expensive.  We felt the newer processor was worth the additional cost and less HDD was not an issue with the price of external HDD being low.  Google differences in the processors and several reports will come up going to great lenghts why each generation is better than the last.The laptop itself is bigger than I had expected.  The texture of the outside is bumpy kinda of a faux carbon fiber look.  The laptop has a 10 key pad and is touch screen.  The screen is very responsive...almost too much!  Windows 8 is new for us and was a challenge getting started but after 15-20 minutes you can figure out just about everything you need.  Laptop connects wirelessly to our network blazingly fast...faster then iPads and phones we have.  Downloaded and installed the free 8.1 update with zero issues.  Picture is excellent and so far has excelled at online gaming, web surfing and email.We purchased for our youngest daughter to play school games, surf the web and play some online games she enjoys.  This laptop will easily meet her needs for several years to come.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect size for the price", "Author": "Misti Holland", "ReviewID": "R2C1ST8PEI63R5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer after doing a small amount of research, but the good review on this product sold me.  With that in mind here is my experience.  I had a Dell laptop for 7-8 years that worked great.  It had outlived it's life so I was looking to replace.  Since I had such great luck with my last Dell, it was only natural I would lean this direction.  I work on a Dell all day at work, but windows 8 was new to me.  I do, however, use an Iphone, so the transition was not difficult at all.  You can delete windows you don't want, pin websites to your windows, move your windows around in the order you want, just like your phone.  I found the adjustment rather easy. I hear from my programming buddies it is a whole different ball game, but if you are a point and click person , like me, you probably wont have any issues.  I was able to download my ITunes account and was playing music in minutes.  This laptop connects quickly to my wifi and I was able to play my FB games, pay bills, check my email, and shop Amazon with little to no learning curve.  I have only had this new laptop for about a week, but have used it for several hours a day each day with no problems at all.  I love the 10 key pad, as I am an accountant in my real life so it is perfect for me. The only thing I wish I had was the lighted keyboard, but if that is as bad as it gets, I would buy this laptop again in a heartbeat.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best bargain for the Year!!!", "Author": "JesseBridgelal", "ReviewID": "RC1VTVVWGGV2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Touchscreen, powerful processor, 6GB RAM....Windows 8.1!!.. sweet laptop for the price!!

One thing I hate about it is if you use the mouse pad, if you unconsciously drag your finger from either side of the mouse pad, it makes this side program (start, control panel, etc. ) come out from the right and lock the screen until you click away from it. If you come from the left it opens the app screen. Very frustrating. Also, I feel the i5 processor is slowwww! If I had to buy again, I would purchase something different.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Product is great", "Author": "Helen Davis", "ReviewID": "R1OUV5U238OM18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Product is great but a little bigger than what I had anticipated.

Kittle", "ReviewID": "R4TIJ1WQBVDNU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop.  It feels a little cheap..I think that's mainly because of the light, streamlined design.  But overall not a by bad laptop. It's fast and the touchscreen display is cool, but I don't use it much because I don't like fingerprints on my screen.  Also I like the fact that there is a separate number pad - makes it easier to type numbers fast.  I had to adjust to Windows 8...I prefer the previous version of Windows.  I know I'm not alone in that preference.The size of the laptop is just right - big enough for watching movies but small enough to carry around.  Word of caution though - finding the program that plays the dvds is tough to locate. I did some research and found that that's because the new Windows took away Windows  media player (yet another reason why don't like Windows 8). I think the program that is installed is Cyberlink (or something like that).  I prefer Windows media player, but this isn't a bad program.  Overall I am happy with my purchase.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "No regrets", "Author": "Bernard", "ReviewID": "R1CWX66PG4PAJQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great product works well. no regrets as yet. will update as time goes by if there are any issues that come up.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Coffe Shop Happy", "Author": "Nicholas Paige", "ReviewID": "R5FZZYFCZZHL4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to write a review that would fall under the most helpful category when it comes to researching and buying a new netbook.I'll start by saying I did a lot of research for this purchase and after deciding to buy it I paid to have the laptop to me in a day and it happened which is props to Amazon.I pulled it out of the box and the first thing I noticed was the black matte' case finish is a type of material that is going to collect a lot of fingerprints and smudges. I wash my hands regularly and have had the laptop 2 weeks now and have often had to wipe off the cover, the keys, and the space where your wrists sit. This is the only thing I can say is BAD about this machine. I do not like that the keys are not lit up for ease of use at night but the screen does provide good lighting and with a bit more focus it isn't a problem.Now to the GOOD. I was going to buy the version without the touchscreen feature and less memory and ram but thinking about the last Inspiron I used, I had no choice but to go with the upgrade because I was so pleased with my last Dell. I opened the netbook to reveal the sleek keyboard layout with a ten key attached to it and enough space to type comfortably. I recommend this for someone with longer fingers than average like me. I turned the laptop on and was so excited to get started after a long 2 hour download and install of 8.1. I began downloading new apps, getting used to the touchscreen, and even got my music and pictures moved over from other devices. The toughest learning curve to get over is using the touchscreen feature and navigating how the new 8.1 works. After a day or two of applied dinkin' around you should catch on to what you can do with the touchscreen and what you can do with the mouse comfortably. I will say touchscreen is the way to go because it's a neat feature worth the extra cost and the mouse clickers are slightly too loud on this model. I use my computer for daily tasks, research, and occasionally talking to family through Skype. The camera on this machine is nice for Skyping, as well as the microphone and audio too. If you're looking for great performance, good graphics, decent sound, and an everyday medium use machine. This one is a good buy. It can burn CDs and DVDs too which is something I haven't done in years. Worth 5 stars in performance but will give it 4 ultimately because I don't like smudges.
