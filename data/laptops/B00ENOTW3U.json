I am not yet familiar with win 8 and touch screen and I believe there is a decent learning curve that I have not scaled. I am used to win 7 and 8 is very different. The tiles dropping down can be annoying when using the mouse. Fortunately desktop mode is familiar win 7 format so I can learn win 8 at my pace.The problem I have with the N550JA, and the reason for this review, is the keyboard design is BAD. It is a wonderful lighted keyboard that is fantastic if you work at night, but it is silver with white inscriptions that can b very difficult to see in daylight. The Asus backlight black keyboard is 1000% better. The reason for a lighted keyboard has been foiled with this design. I used to have a problem at night, now night is fine and I can't see during the day...urgh!Update:I was so wrong! fn13, fn14 are the function keys to adjust backlight. Turn backlight down in daylight and there is no problem at all. oops!", "Date": "February 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Asus laptop, The best.", "Author": "KAREL CASO", "ReviewID": "R18Q2D29W5DRSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A+++ laptop excellent quality, beautiful exterior and interior design, very fast computer, I am very happy with my new computer, Thanks.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Weird keyboard layout", "Author": "Sergiy Zuban", "ReviewID": "R1V4FAYB2EKFVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Keyboard layout is very unusual.

Windows 8 and 8.1 are nightmares in their own right, disallowing you to run many programs that would run fine on windows 7 (such as audio editing software and VSTi's), including many native 64 bit applications.  ASUS brings their own horrible bloatware to the table with hidden apps like Power4Gear which secretly overrides any power management options you set in Windows, ruining your work by putting your laptop to sleep or shutting it down without your permission when you least expect it and leaving you wondering what happened.I have been a big ASUS fan in the past, but this laptop has been a complete disaster for the last several weeks.  Even attempting to upgrade the special slim DVD drive to HDD storage requires special tools and professional level microsurgery involving over a dozen tiny T5 torx screws of varying lengths and complete removal of the entire back panel of the laptop (unlike most any other laptop).  If I wanted this much trouble upgrading a laptop, I would have bought an Apple.At this point, I may start over with something more friendly like an HP Elitebook.  Oh, and I'll be upgrading THAT one from Windows 8 to Windows 7!***Update***After considerable use, I must say this is hands down the worst computing experience I've had in 30 years.  When programs crash, they lock the entire system completely.  When the task manager is called via CTRL+ALT+DEL, it too crashes and freezes permanently (if it shows up at all, which is about a 60% chance).  Sadly, I've made a $1000 investment in this piece of garbage and am stuck unless I sell it to some poor unsuspecting person (which would be immoral).  Avoid this mistake and go with a company that offers support for Windows 7.***Another Update***This operating system is now preventing me from deleting files or folders I've created and placed in the My Documents folder or on the Desktop.  Restarting the computer has not solved the issue. Drive tests show the HDD to be fine, so it doesn't seem to be a hardware problem.  How bad does an OS have to be to have such a bug?  Because ASUS insists on supporting only WIN 8, the blame is theirs.  I used to be very supportive of ASUS.  All of my home-built and work-built towers sport ASUS motherboards.  They've completely lost my long term business by choosing to support Microsoft's wishes instead of their customers'.  If I had gone with anyone else, I might have had driver support for Win 7.  Avoid this laptop!!!***Final Update***Four different VSTi's (a few thousand dollar's worth) and a few other programs (some of which were 64 bit native) would not function properly in W8 or 8.1.  Amazon provided a refund.  Amazon is fantastic about that.  If all you are doing is browsing the internet or writing emails, this laptop will be fine for that.  Amazon is definitely the place to buy it for their return policy.
