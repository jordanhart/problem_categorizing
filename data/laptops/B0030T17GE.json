Because of her work as a grade school teacher she had a school assigned laptop and had come to really appreciate a laptop's utility and convenience.  We examined features, prices, etc on every laptop in the $800 and under price range and picked this model Dell from Amazon.  We've both been blown away by it's display clarity, speed, ease of use, and features like full numeric keypad, built in camera, as well as the features of the loaded Windows 7 OS.As for Amazon's performance as a seller?  Exceptional!  I can't promise this will be your experience, but we took the \"free shipping\" option available at the time, and got the computer \"the next day!\"  This is a fine computer at a great price from an excellent retailer.", "Date": "June 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Mor Lapid Reter \"Alon Reter\"", "ReviewID": "R27ZH2SKSC3D2X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop that provides good performance comparing to the price.Disadvantages:Dell bloats the OS with unnecessary software that caused some crashes.

I needed the best price for a laptop that suited my business needs.  This turned out to be just right.  I needed the large HD and lots of memory.  However, I lug it around a lot, so it had to be pretty light-weight. Dell has good support, the price was good and setting it up was so easy and almost automatic. If I had to buy again, I would buy this computer.  Special feature:  Very few laptops have a keypad, so felt lucky that this one included it.", "Date": "July 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Overheating, Hard Drive Failing Piece of Garbage", "Author": "Warming Hut", "ReviewID": "R1Y0WY7CMHDJER", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've now owned this computer for six months. My hard drive has failed once already and I'm certain it is going to fail again. It overheats whenever you run more than one program at a time. It has downright stupid fan placement. The touchpad is complete garbage and skips all over the screen while you are trying to type an email or a letter, often erasing all your work. Customer service has awful English skills and is nearly useless. I paid $600 for this and I desperately wish I could get my money back.You might like this right out of the box, but give it six months and you'll regret your purchase.", "Date": "January 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice computer!!", "Author": "Tony G", "ReviewID": "R2K4WL7QJP9NW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been over a month since we bought this computer, we have not experienced any problems.

After just 3 months, my computer would overheat to the point of automatically shutting off. I've had to take it apart, pull the heat sink off the CPU, only to find that there was almost no thermal paste, and what was left had the consistency of dried out gum. Also, the heat sink makes an arc, passing from the CPU over the graphics card part of the motherboard. The heat from the CPU just gets passed on to the graphics card, so my GPU is always about 15 to 20 degrees hotter than the CPU, which gets up to 80 degrees with just internet browsing! Horrible design.Also, the battery dies after 2 months. What's the point of having a laptop that you have to haul around the power cord or else it dies after 5 minutes?Dell lies about battery life. They said it would last 6 hours light use, 4-5 hours moderate use, and 3 hours with heavy use like gaming. Lie. When I first bought it, it lasted 1 hour with heavy use and 2.5 hours with light use. Then, like I said, the battery completely died after 2 months.Never buy a dell, period. This is not a one off situation. Search the internet about dell overheating and dell skimping on hardware. You'll find lots of results.Also do a search on how horrible their customer service is.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful Little Jet Engine", "Author": "Reece Tolkinen", "ReviewID": "R2LZPNDDO11EMF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this computer in college for my Majors in Network Administration and Information Systems Management. its been a beauty since the day I bought it. the hardware can takes the abuse of hardcore gaming, and the built in Keyboard is wonderful for typing notes and writing papers (Larger Keys are better for me at least).Pros: Wonderful Hardware for what I need, Big screen for what i have experienced in Laptops, Nice Gloss Finish, Gets the job done!Cons: Not a fan of the Function Key (Fn Key) controlling my function buttons and having my system keys (such as play and brightness controls) being the default, adding to a key to my ALT-F4 Tendencies. Oh and the Fan when it activates sounds like a jet. it pumps out heat pretty well for its size but it does get loud if you cover the intake.I'm not going to comment on the Software, seeing as how you could wipe this laptop clean and boot anything you want.Enjoy Your purchase :)", "Date": "October 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Best computer quality/price !!", "Author": "luchomet", "ReviewID": "R14VED9D136JDI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it for the price and specs and it turned out to be perfect for me.

I didn't even know if this computer was still for sale considering it's getting rather old for the computer world. I've never had anything good to say about this laptop. The DAY after the 14-15 day return policy it died. I went through a month plus of b/s with Dell and then finally got it fixed. It freezes, crashes, key board stinks, mouse stinks, battery went to crap within the first year, etc etc etc. Overheats almost every time I use it (it's about burning the poo out of my leg right now), too embarrassed to even take it to classes with me. I paid 600-700 for this computer, never ever again will I spend that amount of money on a laptop and certainly will be getting a different brand.", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Replaces a Dell \"lemon\"", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2UNYSGJGEK9I3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After having a different Dell Inspiron for less than 4 months that was a total lemon, with the help of a Dell authorized shop, Dell finally replaced it with the Dell Inspiron 1564. For the most part, what I use it for it is very good, especially compared to what I had in the past. I don't like the idea that the warranty didn't start at the time I received my new computer, but that's how Dell works & has nothing to do with the way this laptop functions. I think my biggest complaint is the location of the USB ports-all of them down way too near the bottom of the computer. I use a cordless mouse and when I plug my printer into the USB on the right, the cord is in the way of my mouse, aside from buying a new longer printer cord for my printer or buying a new printer(this one is less than a year old) I have no really good solution.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "awesome laptop", "Author": "Stephanie Jeff \"Sammie's mommy\"", "ReviewID": "R1ML8LWE71HB1Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop for the money, it's fast, easy to use, and I love windows 7.
