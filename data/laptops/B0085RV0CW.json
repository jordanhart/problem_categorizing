Wilcox", "ReviewID": "R3NJ5JV3NE7YBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife to replace a six year old 15\" HP laptop that had grown very slow and needed a new battery.  This laptop fits the bill.  It is fast, she loves the larger screen, it is not too heavy and she doesn't have to drag around an electrical cord behind her any more (for some reason she did not want to spend the money on a new battery).  The high gloss black finish looks very good.  She has had no problems with this computer which is wirelessly connected to our home network.  A 17\" laptop with these specs at this price is a good deal.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "DEFECTIVE laptop.

The first thing to happen was the rubber stopper that sits on the edge of the upper casing to protect the lid when it closes fell out.  I called the service department and got a run around.  They claimed it wasn't something they could fix under the warranty because they said I caused the damage.I didn't cause the damage.  I'm very careful and gentle in handling all of my electronics.The second thing to stop working was the touchscreen.  Seven months after buying it the touchscreen stopped working.  When I googled around to find a fix for the touchscreen I learned many have had the same problem withsimilar Pavilion laptops made by HP.I called the tech department and then customer service.  After hours on the phone they reluctantly agreed to let me send the laptop in for service.  Still they wouldn't! Honor the warranty.  HP wanted $280.

Within a few weeks of using it, I discovered that the text will freeze or gray out no matter what program I'm using: Word, calculator, spreadsheets, logging into sites using passwords, entering data online, you name it. This is the most frustrating machine I have EVER had the displeasure of owning. I have consulted computer experts and they always leave scratching their heads over this problem. No one can fix it for me. I have already had to go back and wake up the text four times since starting this paragraph. It's aggravating when I can't even look away from the screen while typing because the freeze will occur without notice and I will have to go back and retype what I thought I had typed already. This is especially annoying when trying to enter passwords; I'll hit enter and then get a message that the password was incorrect, all because the screen froze while I was typing. Additionally, I am forced to restart the computer after it has been left idle for any length of time. If I go back to wake it up, the screen will go black for several seconds and then reappear. It does this over and over, not just once. I find myself having to wait for the black screen to go away so I can see the restart button. All in all, I'm ready to use this computer for target practice and go back to my beloved Toshiba Satellite. GO AWAY, HP!!!!!", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I wish I could rate this piece of poop lower than 1 star", "Author": "Kristine Walberg", "ReviewID": "RQVGAGLJ0VJZU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I want to preface this review by stating that I have been a loyal HP customer for years, and have owned a series of their printers and laptops that were sturdy, dependable and user-friendly.  I've also been a loyal Microsoft customer both at home and in an office setting.  I've taught computer skills as a corporate trainer and as a library volunteer.  New operating systems and computer programs don't scare me at all.  What does scare me are random inescapable screens dropping down on me in the middle of a project deadline.  What makes my fellow geeks think I want a full-page announcement strobing in my face to tell me I'm not online with Xbox music when I'm balancing my business's books in Excel.  I have never been so annoyed by an OS as I am by Windows 8--and I say that as someone who first used a computer that operated on punchcards, and who once owned a Commodore 64.  Bill Gates, as your next charitable act, would you be so kind as to drive a stake into the heart of this monstrosity?As to the laptop itself, it would be fine if only HP hadn't decided to construct the disk drive tray out of the same material used to make plastic forks for the Dollar Store.  It's brittle.  It's flimsy.  It just hangs there on the underside of the laptop waiting for something bad to happen.  To add to the user's sense of peril, the button to open the drive is stiff and unresponsive, and can only be opened with the extremely careful application of a stylus.This madness began when my sister very generously gave me the 15.6\" HP Pavilion.  Within 15 minutes, I'd noted all of the above concerns, but foolishly asked myself, \"How bad can it be?\"  I got my answer 4 days later when I pushed the button to eject a disk and it promptly fell into the computer, never to be seen again.  Sure that it had to be a fluke, I decided to upgrade to the 17.3\" model.  Needless to say, I was equally unimpressed but, once more, hoped for the best.  As befits a higher-priced model, the 17.3\" held up to 9 whole days of gentle, intermittent use.  On day 9, I carefully pushed the button to insert a disc.  The drawer slid out slowly, dropping several pieces of Dollar Store plastic in its path.  That was the last sliding it ever did, and it's on its way back to Amazon with its assortment of small broken pieces and its drawer stuck half in and half out.Amazon has been great through all this, they really have, but the fact remains that I'm trying to run a home-based business with no computer to handle shipping records, mailing, bookkeeping and design work.  My business is based on creating products that will last a lifetime and will give my customers real enjoyment.  My #1 goal is make my customers happy.  I wouldn't feel right if I ran things any other way.  If I can do that, with my $0 budget, it's too bad the big guys at HP and Microsoft can't do the same.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP Pavilion g7-224us", "Author": "XmasPink", "ReviewID": "R2R1JBB8G390OD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HP Pavilion g7-224us, the quality of this laptop is of poor quality, inserting a cd is almost impossible.

It's proven to be functional for his purposes and really fits the bill for what someone who uses a computer solely for internet/email/Office software needs.Pros:-Size. My Dad wanted a 17\" screen so he could more easily read things and have a better viewing experience when watching video streaming services. This is one of the few consumer-grade laptops that offers the 17\" size at a reasonable price, so it's good for this purpose.-Weight. I've owned two performance/gaming laptops and they have both been on the chunky size. This is a relatively thin and lightweight laptop at 17\", and the power adapter is quite slim as well. I was pleased with the size/weight.-Software. Came with limited bloatware that I was able to purge easily, also ran Windows 7 which was great for my Dad who was upgrading from a Windows XP computer. Windows 8 would've been traumatizing for him.Cons:-Screen resolution isn't full 1080p. Not really an issue for him (doesn't know the difference) but for someone used to gaming-grade laptop screens it was a little jarring.-Screen quality is a little washed out, not really a sharp display. Gets the job done but nothing to write home about.-Keyboard doesn't have backlit keys.Conclusion:This has been a solid consumer-grade laptop.

Golino", "ReviewID": "R1SVWIW94B9OX1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HP is a nightmare of a company.  They do not care about their customers.  I have now purchased two different HP laptops that cost a total of almpost $1000,and both machine were worthless.  First one (different model) lasted less than two years and then overheated and stoppedaltogether.  I did everything on my part, but it did not help.I really thought this model would be better esp. with cool sense.  After 3 1/2 weeks, the machine began overheating, the coolsense stopped working, and the machine would not shut down or re-start properly because the cooling fans do not work.This is clearly a systemic issue with HP machines.  Yes, overheating can be an issue with laptops, but in many cases itis simply necessary to clear the dust out of the vents, or to update the BIOS.  When I contacted HP for help, the only thing theywere willing to do was to try updating the BIOS.  They were unwilling to try any other diagnostics, and said I had to return my newmachine for repair.  Fortunately I bought from Amazon and can still return under the 30 day policy.  I asked them to please make sureeverything had been tried, to try proxying into my macine, etc.  In the past when HP used Indian tech support, I got decent help.  Butthis is a typical case of an American company that takes its customers for granted, and does not care about them or their business.I explained that I am a writer and can not be without my pc, and that I was not having a lot of other problems (just a couple minor anomalies),and that the machine was really not getting that warm.  They did not care.  Once I was dealing with the case manager, they had made theirdecision not to help me anymore, refused my request for a courtesy in-home repair esp. since this was my second HP machine that failed onme.  I know HP is widely bought, but do not waste your money, and take a chance on having to go through the nightmare of spending weekssetting up your machine, printers, network, etc., and then have to get a new machine and start all over again.  Do yourself a favor andbuy a more reliable machine from a company that values its customers.
