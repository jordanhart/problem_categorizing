{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Mid-level no nonsense laptop", "Author": "Willis J. Adair \"\"Only in the darkness ca...", "ReviewID": "R3C6V3AMOT4OQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work for a small non-profit that is a mix platform environment. We are slowly migrating from XP Professional to Win 7 Professional. We plan to stay Win 7 Professional as our primary platform until 2015 or a version of Windows 8 that is not created for dyslexic hipster kitties. This hardware is actually usable for business application. We run two Windows 2008 R2 servers and these HP 2000-428dx laptops work really well as mid-level pac computers hooked to our network. I had stayed clear of HP for the last few years but was willing to give them a shot again because of the AMD hardware specs, reasonable price point, and a design that is more or less right for business use.We run Word, Excel, Outlook, and a custom win 32 app on it. It handles wireless networks well which is a godsend for our users. I am our agencies IT department. I have purchased 3 of these computers so far. I am going to be ordering a couple more. Two came from one of the box stores and one from Amazon. Amazon was cheaper and had them instock when I order the last one. Hardware wise all three have worked well out of the box. I installed Win 7 Pro and never ran the stock Win 7 Home. It runs well four or five business apps at a time including the Kaspersky antivirus which is a memory hog. Though the 4 gigs of RAM  seem to keep the program from not bogging down these machines. Users typically reboot at the beginning of the day and are good till the end of the day. Normal Windows 7 load time. I stress that these are fine for mid-level price conscious computers. You will not be playing Skyrim, have two dozen Chrome tabs open, running a Virtual Machine with your vintage OS2 running just to play Mahjong on it, while listening to Mumford and Sons on this hardware without seriously bogging it down. I wouldn't image trying to run say Adobe graphics software on this or non-business applications.The hardware design is functional and is aestethically pleasing. The mousepad can be turned off when you plug in a wireless mouse which makes typing much easier!  My one real gripe is the power cord seems to follow HP's model of producing cheap cords. I wish they would migrate towards designing a similar power cord more like the Macbook power cord with the magnetic lock in place of the current design that feels flimsy. I imagine the cord will break before the year is out though the jury is still out on this aspect. Overall, this model is worth the money and if HP keeps producing solid computers like this then they will have a chance at not just survival but becoming popular again. I also wish they would produce some of their computers in the USA. I would pay a extra 100 for the made in USA sticker.I have had two of these online for 30+ days with no real complaints. 1 has been on for 15+ days with no real complaints. I will update if I have any real problems and hope to get at least two years out of these computers. I will update this review if I notice any major hardware issues.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price!", "Author": "Aleksey", "ReviewID": "R3FQRASETLD0Z1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this laptop for about 6 months now. It works perfectly and the way I need it to, the price was very good for what it has inside of it. Dual core processor and 4GB of ram makes the programs run smoothly without any problems. It also has a 320GB hard drive which gives me plenty of space to save my files. This HP laptop is great and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good laptop for a good price.", "Date": "May 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "works fine, sound not so good", "Author": "Alban", "ReviewID": "RL5QXC53CGWCW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good price, works fine, sound system is poor; skeeping that it is a good computer, I use it to work, I am a travel agent and this computer is all i need.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Meh.", "Author": "TK", "ReviewID": "R2XOSZ7ZYZJHY4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this computer because it was cheap, and I got what I paid for. The plastic casing, keyboard, touchpad, and buttons all look and feel very cheap. The keyboard layout is, at times, counter-intuitive. The page down, page up, delete, and home buttons are stacked vertically at the far right, which means they're incredibly easy to hit accidentally when backspacing or hitting enter, which gets irritating.Then there's the the touchpad, by far the most frustrating part. It's temperamental and unresponsive, consistently missing taps and clicks and scrolls and swipes. It's awful, just awful. I thought it would be something I could get used to, but we've had the computer for a month now and I still haven't figured out the touchpad. If you have the means, get a good wireless mouse to go with it.The computer comes preloaded with a whole bunch of useless software(most notably: Blio, Roxy, and two or three forgettable music-playing programs, one of which wanted subscription fees). It took me several days of tinkering to pare down superfluous software, and the computer still runs depressingly slow.There's stuff to like, though. It is, as I said, a relatively cheap machine. (I found it at Best Buy for $299, only about forty dollars more than I paid for my netbook.) The display is quite wide and reasonably crisp. It's also lighter than I thought it would be, making it surprisingly portable for such a chunky computer.All in all, I would recommend this to students on a budget, but not anyone else. If you're looking for a simple machine to surf the web, do homework, and word-process on, this is a good deal. Otherwise, I would recommend spending a little more and getting something nicer.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "hp 2000 Laptop", "Author": "Lois S.

I was on a shoestring budget and looking for a light, inexpensive laptop with the resolution, speed, and power that I needed for both work (online transcription) and play (WoW, Diablo III). By some miracle I found this at the local Best Buy for $300 and was not disappointed. It is unfortunate that some users have experienced glitches with this computer, but it has been running fine for me for the past 7 months. I'm not exactly computer savvy, but this has everything I need for both work and gaming. I haven't experienced any terrible glitches, though the speakers are a little quiet, and the startup has been a bit loud at times. I usually use a mouse, but when I use the touchpad it works just fine. The only real complaint I have is that there doesn't seem to be any num pad function. I'm thankful that I found this computer when and where I did, and I anticipate further months and maybe years of good service. If you get a dud, I hope they replace it for you and send you one that works as well as mine.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "More glitches than you can believe", "Author": "B.

Ive had ten year old computers that work better and gave me less grief. This thing has constant glitches, shuts down the internet every 15 minutes or so, every other day will not allow you to send an email through your gmail account (it is definitely the computer that has the issue, as Ive tried using gmail on my other computers and iphone using our same internet connection and it worked just fine), and a barrage of other annoying problems. One of the most obnoxious issues is the shrinking of the screen to a point where you cant read the print every time you try to scroll down a page, which happens every few days or so.

First off when you boot it up for the first time prepare to spend hours updating it, but I guess that's normal with most new computers. After the updates and its booted, the first thing you'll notice is all the junk software that's piled on your desktop. After deleting all of it, the computer still ran incredibly slow, so I decided to double the ram to 8gig. Still nothing, the computer runs painfully slow.

The wireless card was not working properly but I found that out after I changed my modem and router.  From there I contacted HP and they took 3 hours on the phone to eventually agree that the wireless card was not working.  Then they told me that I could be without a laptop for 3 weeks or they would send me the wireless card to install.  Of course I installed the wireless card and it still does not work.  I owned this product for just over 30 days before I noticed the issue (probably was a problem the first day).
