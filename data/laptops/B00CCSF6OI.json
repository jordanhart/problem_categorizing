I cannot find anything wrong with this machine. I've got it refurbished but looks like new and it saved me a few hundred dollars.I've had Acers for years and they continue to impress me.", "Date": "July 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price.", "Author": "John Campbell \"MrLightRail\"", "ReviewID": "R1XP6DTSNSB7BU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Decided to go with a full touchscreen laptop, now that Windows 8 is out there, and I went with this unit for the same money a 11'' Acer was selling for at Wal-Mart, but this one had the larger screen, Intel processor, and a optical drive. Added two gigs of memory to bring it to 8 gigs, which is the maximum for this machine. Would have loved to have 12 gigs. Unit did not come with a SSD drive, and it is difficult to swap drives in this laptop. I've always had easy access to the hard drive in all of my previous laptops, but this one is a BIG exception.I've had no gripes about the unit, other than the HDD expansion/swap issue until I upgraded the OS to Windows 8.1. From then on, I could never keep a stable wifi connection. I've heard that changing your router to only support 20ghz wifi will fix the drops, and so far it has, but there needs to be a fix so I can use the full capabilities of my router.I don't use the trackpad on this unit, as my palm causes inadvertent mouse clicks constantly. Really not too much of an inconvenience, since I use the touchscreen for most of my usage. But, if I want to type, I disable it first. (like now).Overall, this is a great machine for the money. If you do decide to get it, order the extra two megs of memory. It does make a difference in overall performance.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "speedy little laptop", "Author": "David O'Dell Petersen", "ReviewID": "R3KGMTTG362AMZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Quick.
