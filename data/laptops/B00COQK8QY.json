The nice things about it are the decent screen (finally a cheap laptop with better than 1024x600 resolution, so at least all my applications will fit on the screen) and the SD card port which holds the card flush with the case (This being the main thing I hated about the Chromebook).If you want to compare it to a Chromebook, this wins by far, but it will take just a little bit of effort to make it better in every way. Namely, installing pipelight to get Netflix and Flash working properly, and fixing the trackpad sensitivity. The pipelight installation has been addressed in other reviews here, but it's worth pointing out that pipelight can also be used to install the Windows Flash which may work better than the Linux one which has fallen behind. However, I haven't seen any mention of how to fix the trackpad. If you google for \"fingerhigh fingerlow\" you should find instructions to fix that.That said, it's obvious that this is a Windows laptop running Ubuntu, and that not much thought was put into it. On the positive side of this, everything can be made to work great with a little bit of effort.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop !!!", "Author": "Lai", "ReviewID": "R1X3CVB11KIBMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my husband while he's in school and he loves it !!!

(Thank you Michael Maiorana)While on the same subject, updating Windows 7 with the latest updates will help you out regarding system resources and the notebook will run better under updated Windows 7.

As long as you know what you are buying and do not expect MacBook Air build quality and you at least have an idea of what Linux is and aren't hopelessly computer illiterate, you will probably like it as much as I do. It's the last of a dying breed, a teeny, tiny 10\" netbook, which is great for those of us who love this form factor. It has a 1366x768 screen, which is as high res as the $5-600 \"budget\" laptops with 14-15\" screens. One important note on the screen though. It looks like a screen from a $229 laptop because, well it is. That cost it a star from me. The screen is OK, but you will not want to use it for hours at a time, it will exhaust your eyes. The colors are washed out too. Like I said, it's perfectly serviceable, but if you're even a little picky about screen quality, look elsewhere, this is a super cheap TN panel that just gets the job done. The 1.1 Celeron processor is no barn burner, but it will run circles around any of the old Atom or AMD netbooks you may have used before. The hard drive is generous enough at 320 gb and 2 GB of RAM is more than enough for Ubuntu to run well. Note: The trackpad isn't great, as many others have said, but it's tolerable for me. Out of the box this machine is ready to use even for a newbie. Don't be afraid of Linux. What you have here is a clean, attractive, quick OS which will NEVER get a virus or malware and never grind to a crawl the way any Windows computer that isn't meticulously maintained will. As long as you have basic requirements, like surfing the web, music, email and maybe some light gaming, this tiny laptop will serve you well. I'd be comfortable giving one to my Mac using mom. If you come at it with a little sense of adventure and the willingness to try something new and you will find that Ubuntu is a delightful alternative to Windows and there's a nice selection of great, FREE apps to fill most all your needs and you can try them all out without any fear of breaking your computer or downloading some virus/malware/worm that's going to steal your identity. What's more is you get a nice $70 discount by not having to pay for a Windows license.

It has all the hallmarks of a hardware failure since an external USB keyboard works fine.I really did like this computer once I got used to the funky touchpad mouse. I also put a fair amount of time into getting it all configured just right.I'm hoping Amazon will issue a full refund. Since the price has gone up I doubt I'll try again since I've had two out of two ASUS computers now have problems with keys and the mouse is funky.It's really disappointing. I was hoping this was going to be the ticket and it would have been had the hardware quality been better.Is it fair to give it one star when any high volume product can experience failures? I think so given that I still haven't heard from ASUS and it's a huge PITA no matter how this problem is resolved because this was my main computer and is in active daily use. Even a new replacement will require the duplication of many hours of work getting it set up.Not only that but the price is such that it's not throw away but it's also not worth putting a lot of hours into. It's right on that frustrating threshold where you want a replacement but don't want to put more time into configuring a new one.  All in all it's a really poor customer experience and I seriously doubt I would ever chance purchasing another ASUS product because of it. What if they really do have quality issues and this isn't just a one off failure?

I use Ubuntu by choice on my other machines, so I'm at ease with the operating system provided.With a Celeron processor and 2 GB of memory, don't expect this little laptop to be a powerhouse ultra-book. You CANNOT upgrade the memory, incidentally; on most (all, according to ASUS) of these motherboards the memory is soldered on. It has a 320-GB hard drive. However, similarly-priced netbooks typically have a slower (Atom) processor, 1 GB of RAM, and a smaller solid-state hard drive; this machine is a cut above.Ubuntu booted and ran out of the box. I added a wireless mouse (worked with no configuration needed) and a LE brand external DVD writer (again, Ubuntu recognized the hardware and no configuration was needed). I added an extra app dock (Cairo-dock) and a Gnome-style application menu (ClassicMenu Indicator) to supplement the Unity interface. The installation of Ubuntu came with most applications pre-installed, but of course I added a few of my own favorites as well. (For Windows users: Ubuntu has an official application repository, and programs found there are malware-free. Programs from outside the repository can be loaded as well; all the ones I've loaded are clean as well. In general, the Linux universe has far fewer adware/trojan/malware dangers than Windows. Edit -- nearly all the applications are free for the downloading.)Software: you get Firefox, an office suite, email and messaging programs; a number of system utilities, photo managing and image editing software, a couple of music players, CD/DVD burning software (though you have to get an external optical drive), movie player, sound recorder, and some other stuff. All apps are fully functional; there are no demo or time-limited trial apps here.Many other reviewers have noted the difficulty in hitting the right-side \"shift\" key; I have the same problem. But, looking at the keyboard layout, I can't really see how ASUS could have done it much differently without altering the modern QWERTY layout. ASUS has pushed the keyboard out nearly to the edge of the chassis, and I think it's about as good as you're going to get for this form factor. I read that the trackpad is difficult to use as well, but as I planned on replacing it with the wireless mouse that wasn't important to me.Sound is predictably tinny. None of the laptops I've used have good sound; again, I don't think the manufacturers can be blamed. It's hard to imagine how to get full-spectrum audio out of speakers wedged into a thin, flat, non-resonant plastic case.Note that on this ASUS the audio jack is a combined headphone/microphone jack: you'll need an adapter that splits the 3-contact pin to one 2-contact headphone socket and one mono microphone socket. They're readily available.The screen is sharp and clear. Viewing angle is just average. Color balance is good.I've run a couple of other Linux-family operating systems on the ASUS, using USB installations: Puppy Linux and -- the most interesting -- a port of Android to x86. For the latter I had to use the Ice Cream Sandwich version, 4.0, because the newer ports wouldn't boot. For the small screen, Android x86 makes a pretty sensible OS for light web browsing even though the ASUS has no touchscreen and you have to use mouse gestures instead.To boot from USB on the ASUS 1015e you insert the media before bootup, and then click \"esc\" repeatedly as the machine boots. If an OS is detected on USB then you'll get a menu offering the option to boot from media or from the hard drive.The Ubuntu operating system could present a learning curve for exclusive Windows or Mac users, but Linux has come a long way from the days when you had to be a terminal-code guru just to install a network card.

I have medium hands and it's almost too small. Yet I can touch type at normal speed after a warm-up. It also feels solid. Keys are whisper smooth. Very nice job there.Used it as a workstation.

Battery life not nearly as good as advertised, but still a lot better than a lot of devices. I get maybe 4 hours, which isn't bad considering the power of this little guy.Brain flatulence: Would it have killed you, Asus, to have upgradeable RAM? Really, now, maybe $1.50 a unit? If it's a space problem, make it 2 mm wider and kill two birds with one stone (cooling and RAM slots). Oh, and the shiny black plastic on the cover is tacky. The matte finish elsewhere on the machine is very nice, though. Shiny bits make it seem cheaper than it really is.Otherwise, awesome computer and a great value.

I'm used to it now.-The right shift key is really tiny, so I keep hitting up arrow by accident, then adding code in the wrong place.-If you unexpectedly find that you need to use more heavyweight applications (in my case, Android Studio), you'll find that it's pretty slow.

I can use it intermittently all day long at school without worrying about charging it, and it's light in my backpack.  It's less than half the weight of my Dell laptop and the battery lasts more than twice as long.I don't like the version of Linux that came installed so I installed Xubuntu, which works great for me.  I tried Mint, which I have got to work with a Broadcom wireless chip once on the Dell, but with school going on I don't have time to try to figure that out again.  With Xubuntu, the wireless worked with no problem.  I did need to download the ISO for Xubuntu and I used UNetBootin to install it to a USB drive (it took > 2 GB).  This is necessary because there is no disc drive.  If you're going to want to do anything fancy -- multimedia presentations, use a TV tuner, or even attach your own printer to it -- I can't guarantee Xubuntu will work.  The Ubuntu that comes preinstalled is more likely to work, especially after you update it, but I don't really like the desktop, customization, or the shell.  You could do a dual-install and have 2 versions on there but your safest bet for multimedia is Windows, or Mac if you use that.  The laptop will do things like play YouTube videos and stream music on Myspace, though.Typing is pretty easy, even with my somewhat large hands.  The only downside is the touchpad.  It is the worst touchpad I've ever used.  It's workable but such a pain.  I changed the settings to disable it while I'm typing so the cursor doesn't jump all over the screen when my palm touches it.  When I absolutely need it, it works but it's hard to pinpoint things, hard to click and drag, and on Xubuntu the right-click doesn't work (although there is a context menu key, which I miss on my Dell :) ).  I live with it because most of what I do on there is typing notes for class or programming.  But if you can't live without Eclipse (I avoid Eclipse anyway), you'll need a mouse because Eclipse makes you use the mouse all the time.All in all, this is a good laptop if you're on a budget and just want it for simple things like writing papers, email and Youtube, scripting, etc.  Not the Cadillac of laptops but it's been really helpful in college.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ubuntu Lives On", "Author": "shutterbug \"shutterbug2\"", "ReviewID": "R3I2E7TZ21AR31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son is a hardcore Ubuntu user.

It is the only tiny laptop with a full size(for a small laptop) hard drive and dual core processor. I chose one with the Ubuntu OS for four reasons: it lowers the price by a considerable percentage since it is open-source; it is less likely to require virus software; it should run a bit faster than Windows 8(I do love Windows 8 on my desktop!); and I wanted an adventure! I am thrilled with the quality of the device and how well it functions. I have no problem attaching devices, such as a mouse or optical drive, and I love the keyboard and the trackpad. When you pick this device up, you can feel that it is very solid.As far as Ubuntu goes, I like it very much. The software center is amazing, including thousands of free(and some at cost) downloads that are Ubuntu compatible. That, by the way, is the key to success with Ubuntu: Do things \"the Ubuntu way\"! A lot of software will not run on Ubuntu, but plenty will. Don't try to download directly from the internet. If it is not in the software center, the only reason is that it is not compatible. For example, Skype that comes from the software center has a different look from the Windows version. In addition, as a scientist, I was very impressed by all of the technical software, much of which I have never even heard of, available. In fact, some software actually runs better on Ubuntu than on Windows 8! For example, I cannot get Eclipse(for Java programming) to run on Windows 8 and to install it requires unzipping files and so forth. With Ubuntu, Eclipse installs with one click and works well. Freemat also runs better on Ubuntu(on Windows 8, in Freemat evoking \"help\" causes the program to shut down).To make sure you have no problems using this, be sure to allow it to update, which is especially important when you first set it up. If you are not familiar with Ubuntu(and if you are reading this, you probably aren't), it may be difficult to notice when it is asking to update. You will see the update manager trying to get your attention on the left side of the screen in the launcher. Two tiny arrows surround the icon and it flashes a bit. You click on it and a screen will appear which will be self-explanatory. You may also click on the top icon to get the desktop(the \"dash\" in Ubuntu) which allows you to search for applications. Just type in \"update\" and the update manager icon will appear on the desktop for you to click on. You should also do this from time to time.Is this a good laptop for a first-time computer user? Probably not, since fewer people are around to help with Ubuntu.

It's *not* intended to be user-serviceable.  There are a couple of videos on YouTube that show how (search for ASUS 1015 disassembly) and there's no need for fancy tools, but you have to force a lot of plastic tabs, some worryingly hard, and open / close various ribbon cables (of the \"no plug, just printed wires\" type).But having said that, it all worked.Installing OpenSuse 12.3 worked fine - the installer automatically did the correct boot type (UEFI or whatever it is).However, once booted up, the network card did not work.  It seemed to be auto-detecting / loading a b43 module, but that lacked firmware.  Searching for that I found a script to install the firmware (download to a connected machine and copy across on USB stick), but that didn't help.  More searching and it turns out that the chip I have (BCM4313 acording to lspci) needs the brcm module.  So I blacklisted b43 and rebooted.  That turned out to need different firmware, which is described at [...] - I cloned the git repo ond copied across the brcm directory.  And that worked!  It's currently updating to the latest packages over the net.So, in summary, install of OpenSuse 12.3 on SSD works OK, with a little footwork.

This one works fairly well, however the battery life is considerably shorter and I've had more problems with it.  I am a fairly novice Ubuntu user, but am familiar.  When the computer arrived, I immediately updated to the latest version of Ubuntu, which took a couple of days to get through.  When I was done, the computer did not suspend (still doesn't) and the touchpad was very touchy (jumps every time I go to click by tapping the touchpad - usually resulting in clicking on the wrong thing).  I contacted Asus support - they were fairly quick to respond, but the only advice they could give me (for both of these problems) was to reinstall the operating system (reverting to the one that came installed).  Since I had considerable time invested in updating this, I wasn't so inclined...  Since others have had the same experience with the touchpad, I am led to believe that it is not a software issue.  I am using a mouse with the computer when practical, other times it is enough of an annoyance to make me wish I had shelled out more for a better computer, but not enough to make me give it up yet.I did have the screen fail on me (not sure what happened) and I sent the laptop off to Asus for repair - they were quick to respond, repair and send it back to me in good working order.

I needed something that I could use to do schoolwork that had an actual keyboard (in other words, not a tablet) and long battery life. This laptop is exactly what it says. It gets about 6 1/2 hours of battery life on the internet and is super light and small. Ubuntu runs pretty well on the hardware and I haven't really noticed any huge performance issues so far.The only two drawbacks that are apparent so far are the track pad and the right side of the keyboard. The track pad is just too sensitive while typing. I have wider hands so I always seem to move the pointer when typing (even though I have the sensitivity turned all the way down and have the \"turn off track pad when typing\" enabled). The right side of the keyboard is quite cramped. The right shift key is particularly bothersome as it is way to close to keys that I normally use it with and as a touch typist I find myself taking my right hand off my home row a little to often.Other than these rather nit-picky design issues this little machine is one heck of a bargain. And don't worry if your no computer geek. Ubuntu is a \"gateway\" GNU/Linux distribution, so you should be fine!

Unlike my first netbook, the Asus 701, this keyboard is big enough to be comfortable and I have little trouble touch typing on it. I was originally looking at a chromebook for web surfing and checking email. When I saw this I had to try it. The display is excellent and is anti-glare coated, which I appreciate. The resolution is great for web browsing, unlike the 701 which was much too small.If you are looking for an Internet \"appliance\", this will work fine. The Linux build is solid and sets up easily. One negative is that you won't be able to watch netflix on this easily. There are some work-arounds, but they can be complex. It does everything else I need as a \"google\" appliance. But it is capable of much more. There is an incredible amount of free linux software available. You just have to look around.The laptop doesn't seem to get very hot at all with just normal browsing. If you tax the processors more it will run hotter (and use more battery). The fan is quiet and not objectionable.Just for fun, I tried installing windows 7 x64 on this machine but was never able to get the video drivers to load without a bluescreen. I went back to the Linux build. If anyone figures out how to do this I'd love to hear how you did it.I took off a star for the touchpad. It is useable, but not great. The buttons are integrated into the pad itself toward the bottom. If I leave my left index finger just resting on the pad above the left button, I lose control of the cursor. A minor annoyance, but something I noticed. I also dinged it for not having upgradable ram or an easily upgradable hard drive. I understand the size constraint, but thought I would mention it. However, 300GB of hard disk and 2GB of ram is likely plenty for this machine and what I will use it for.Overall an excellent buy, and of course sent by Amazon quickly and on time.Update:I figured out the windows 7 problem. The Intel HD video drivers would cause a bluescreen on reboot. Before installing the drivers, I installed Service Pack 1 into Windows 7. After installing Service Pack 1, the Intel HD drivers installed without any problems.
