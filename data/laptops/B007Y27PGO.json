Harper", "ReviewID": "R1ZQZWHL6PG78Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a graphic designer and casual gamer, so I was looking for a laptop that could handle graphics well without totally shattering my budget. This laptop does exactly that. I've been totally thrilled with it from the moment I got it.Performance:It had a very easy setup - some bloatware, but not too much. I downloaded a few games to test it out, and it handled everything admirably. Skyrim, Borderlands, CoD:MW3, and Deus Ex: HR all ran without a hitch, even with other performance-intensive programs running in the background. I have the Adobe CS5 collection, and so far I've been able to run as many of those programs as I wanted simultaneously without any problems or slowdowns whatsoever. The system runs very cool - I played Deus Ex for between 6-7 hours and had no temperature problems. There's a fan control on the keyboard in case you do need to control your temperature. The high resolution is especially nice for working with Adobe - I have much more desktop space for all the toolbars and menus, while still having large sections of my projects in view. It has a nice sound management system for hooking up to headphones or external speakers. There are plenty of ports available for peripherals. There's a slight overhang from the keyboard, so if you have a particularly fat flash drive it may be a tight squeeze, but that's really the only difficulty I foresee.Aesthetics:The keyboard is especially nice; has a very good feel. There's a quick access button for turning the touchpad on/off (very handy for gaming). There's a glossy bit on the case right around the keyboard that tends to show a lot of scuffs and fingerprints, but the rest of the case has a \"brushed\" feel and stays pretty clean-looking for the most part. The backlights in the keyboard attract a lot of attention, but they are very useful if you do a lot of work in low light or if you do a lot of gaming. The built-in speakers aren't TV quality or anything, but they are surprisingly good for a laptop.The Good:Performance, graphics, priceThe Bad:Weight - this thing is a beast; if you need something highly portable, think twiceOverall:Would absolutely recommend this to just about anybody!", "Date": "September 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent gaming laptop", "Author": "S. Barrett", "ReviewID": "R22TQMX93CUPWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a really good deal for a gaming laptop.  I use it for work and run my work OS in a VM.  This thing has more than enough power to handle anything I throw at it including running multiple virtual servers in my lab.  One thing to note, it did not come equiped to handle VMs, the BIOS on these machines is extremely locked down and MSI had not set the setting to VT-x to \"on\" in the default BIOS, they have since resolved that issue with an update.  Also, getting into the laptop from the bottom side is a little \"iffy.\"  The back black you have to take off to get access to the hard drives and second set of RAM is extremely flimsy.  You have to be very careful with it.  Also, there is a misleading sticker on the back that indicates if you remove the back plate it will void your warranty.

Get it before Windows 8 becomes the dominant operating system. Anyone who has spent 5 minutes on it would know what I am talking about. Windows 8 is NOT ideal for competent users who do a lot of file management or use their computers for actual work rather than just screwing around.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better and Cheaper end game laptop", "Author": "batangX", "ReviewID": "R2H94PV7FKFHQB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Design:This is a stunner, a headturner laptop. I love the design its really better in real life than what you see in the internet. The keyboard is fully customizable just like my old alienware, u can choose a 3 different color and make your keyboard have 3 different color at once and could add some effects on it. The screen has a anti-reflection coating which is good for a gaming laptop. Its is also lighweight (8.6lbs) compared to other gaming laptop in its category.Performance: Ive been using this laptop as a desktop replacement for 2 months and so far its pretty solid. No crashes whatsoever, everything works out of the box. I use this laptop everyday for like 8-14hrs a day and play games like WoW, dota2, d3 CS, battlefield and more but be sure to have a good cooling pad on it like the coolermaster notepal x2.

The steelseries back lit keyboard is also very cool.", "Date": "October 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best laptop to date.Kills all of those heavy gaming laptops out of the water!", "Author": "LKGG18", "ReviewID": "R2TP5IDNS6LSHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from Newegg.com since it was cheaper and on sale during the time. The laptop is so light it is amazing. When I opened the box, I saw that the laptop was well sealed and protected from the protected wrap. When I first turned it on, it gave me a couple of problems as to didn't know that the laptop had a blackout screen button that is touch sensitive on the front panel by the power button. When I turned it back on, the monitor had artifacts on it so I was worried I might of grabbed a defective unit. Well turns out that I just needed to restart the computer. I set everything up and loaded windows flawlessly. So far it runs WoW on max settings, Diablo 3 on Max, and pretty much any game you throw at it. I was able to run BF3 on flawless settings and also CoD4 on 120FPS!!!! The graphics card is a major beast.I saw that some people are having problems with the swappable graphics card. I suggest you program your software first before opening up. I saw the Intel graphics made my webcam choppy on Yahoo Messenger and Skype so I made both programs to use the Geforce and fixed the problem.The major downside to this is the warranty sticker on the bottom of the laptop base. If you remove this sticker, your warranty is shot. This means you can't upgrade your memory, hard drive, or being able to clean it.I suggest you buy a accidental warranty to back your warranty up if you are going to upgrade it. The stick on the back of the laptop says if removed or snapped, it is considered a voided warranty according to MSI so please be careful on this.Overall my best 5 features:1. Swappable Graphics for better battery life (Gave me 5 1/2 hours of battery life on Intel graphics and low power settings on battery)2. Fan Control Button which is awesome.3. Turbo Button for quick overclock. Made my 120FPS CoD4 to run a lot better on turbo mode4. Very lightweight. Best gaming laptop to date that is not heavy.5. Sound quality is at its best and never had an Amped up headphone jack before and wow! I hear the difference between my G78s Asus laptop and my new MSI Laptop. Very nice!!Overall It is well worth to get. I bought an extra battery for this thing with no problems so parts are there to order if you need an extra battery or power cord.", "Date": "September 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "USB charging while off...WHA?!?!?", "Author": "Patrick Flynn", "ReviewID": "R1QKNP5NCBBAJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to go over what has been mentioned here, but I went ahead and bought it elsewhere.

The performance is what you would expect from a $1g+ computer. Apparently MSI computers are known for having hardware issues which I was not aware of. Yesterday morning I go to turn on my laptop and get no response, all that happens if the Power button blinks. I tried all the methods they say for fixing it and nothing worked.So now im left with no laptop for 3 weeks ( While im in college ) and have to pay the shipping to get it fixed. Thats honestly sad you pay that much for something that crashes a week after you buy it.Like I said though, when it was working.

It would sit at the loading screen for ages until I would give up and power it down by holding down the power button. After a few times of doing this it would finally start. After awhile it seemed to clear up.3 months or so later the real problems start. when I had it plugged in it would randomly power down so I had to charge it while it was off then use it with out a power cord plugged in. I later found that if it was fully charged you could leave it plugged in to keep it fully charged.Then the audio out of the 3.5mm jack started sounding messed uplastly, the laptop started smoking with the power plugged in.When I purchased this Laptop I was extremely busy just started a new job and had to do all sorts of training and had to move 6 hours away in a rush, I didn't register my laptop with in 30 days of purchase. I rarely do any way, and never have had a vender refuse to honor a warranty. I am very upset with MSI, I bought my Laptop from Amazon who has been a dream to deal with when problems arise, just wish the major problems happened in the 1st month so amazon would have been the one I would have been dealing with.my GT70 is now a $1500 paperweight. thanks MSI... hope you enjoy my money.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "MSI Discontinues Batteries", "Author": "sam78", "ReviewID": "RY7MTQ4C0I0JX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would not buy from MSI because I bought an A6200 planning to buy their long lasting battery for it and they discontinued this battery within a month after I bought it!
