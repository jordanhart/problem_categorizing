I have a ProBook 4510s that I carry around that I love cause it's small, this 4720s is just like that but with a larger screen which is nice but heavier to carry and now that I am getting use to Windows 7, sort of, I like that as well, although I will keep all my XP systems as XP.  I also have the ProBook 4730s and to compare the two it's like this.  More money for the 4730s and it has the finger reader built in so it's a bit nicer.  Other then that there the same, least I think they are, for I do not overload the memory and such to notice a difference.So, that's my short version of this laptop.  O, also like the finish on the outside over the slick black of my older 4510s that shows every fingerprint.PS>i bought an open box one and was worried a bit but see no issues with it.", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0049OKVSE"}}
