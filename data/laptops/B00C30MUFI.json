Many might complain about a slow HDD speed, apparent \"too heavy\" characteristic, etc, but this computer makes up for it in great and many ways. If you worry about speed, it is only a real problem if you have to boot something immediately (I recommend having it always on sleep or hibernation- there's always a plug nearby where to charge the poor battery); if you think it's too heavy, it is time to check a doctor or hit the gym because you are too weak. Great sophisticated look, fabulous screen, huge memory. Only flaw is not having a number keyboard. The Windows 8 problem is only temporary: after a while you get used to it and it becomes very helpful, but if it doesn't work for you, there are solutions out there that will give some previous Windows OS functions to your 8 (like a Start button on your desktop).", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Product.
