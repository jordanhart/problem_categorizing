By far, this machine is tops in its class. It is fast, quiet, cool, and runs everything I throw at is just fine. The only downside, is that the sound quality is minimal at best. The battery life on this unit is about 6 hours with normal power settings.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba C655-SS206", "Author": "Christopher R Chismire", "ReviewID": "R1E9BF9VIP9IVP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything as advertised, great battery life, large disk and internal memory to meet my program requirements.

Faulty hinge design. Needs revision, and not durable at all", "Author": "StudioDude", "ReviewID": "ROKSLQ5VKUY6O", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like the title says, the hinge design is not good, and it needs to be rethought out. The plastic casing isn't durable at all, so if you drop it, you're out of luck. To elaborate on the hinge on this computer, it broke with very light usage, and I don't recommend this to anybody.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Buen producto", "Author": "Zenem", "ReviewID": "R1956C281BMJ16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ha resultado ser un buen producto y bueno el servicio de entrega.Cumple con las especificaciones ofrecidas por el proveedor.Recomendado.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great everyday laptop, but...", "Author": "David Galli", "ReviewID": "R189WPLOUHDWIF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Satellite C855-S5206 laptop (which is the model higher than this one, but Amazon doesn't seem to carry) about a month ago and use it for school, limited gaming and everyday computing. Fast processor and it does save a lot of energy when it come to power consumption.  My only complaint:  The \"F\" keys (F1-F12) in the upper row, which are also \"FN\" keys for things like audio and turning on/off the WiFi are NOT what you think. You have to hold the FN key to use the F1-F12 keys, instead of holding the FN key for the other commands like volume, touchpad on/off and WiFi on/of. So, those of us that are used to using \"Alt+F4\" to close a window, now have to push \"FN+Alt+F4\" which is REALLY annoying! But, other than that, it is a great machine with a long battery life even with WiFi being on.  So, 4 out of 5 stars because of the FN key row.", "Date": "October 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "As expected laptop", "Author": "K.

This was the best I could afford.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  It does everything I need and a bit more.  The keyboard seemed a bit tight, but I love the 10-key.  I have adapted.  I would still rather have spent a grand, but for a little over 400 it is great.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "I will never buy Toshiba laptop again", "Author": "David Amey \"Older than most dirt\"", "ReviewID": "RTZNVY7UZSPC6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am one of the thousands of people who got the F3-F200-0002 error on their Toshiba laptops that are running Windows 7. This is the kiss of death. The recovery discs don't work and my only option is to send the unit back to Toshiba and wait a few weeks to see if they can figure it out.  My unit is four months old and is one of the CG55 line. Don't say you weren't warned. Good luck if you already have one of these pieces of junk.", "Date": "January 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005ZLRVT2"}}
