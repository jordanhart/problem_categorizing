{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Warning!!! This PC has issues....", "Author": "Arne D Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3P6G02YELU9F5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Might be a good idea to stay clear of this model! Specs are great but (as I found out too late while dealing with HP tech service) this model HP e140us laptop has issues with shut down, sleep, and hibernation. If you don't mind having to press the power button for 5-seconds every time the laptop goes to sleep, hibernates, or when you attempt to shut it down normally, then this is the laptop for you. Just hope it doesn't go to sleep in the middle of your edits, or they will be lost.Note that these issue happened out of box, and continued, even after all HP drivers, HP software, and Windows updates had been installed, with no other 3rd party software loaded. Restoring factory defaults did not help. Anyway, a search of the internet indicates my laptop was not unique to this issue... seems many have dealt with the same problem, without a cure. One other thing, while trying to resolve the issue I found I could not update to Windows 8.1. It's possible this was related to whatever was preventing the machine from being shut down properly, but then again maybe not. Anyway, be warned. I've always liked HP's, but get another model, not this one!Update: Sometime between me purchase (2-weeks ago) and my review (2-days ago) I noticed that HP began selling this model with Windows 8.1 installed (versus the 8.0 sold with mine). Interesting. This might indicate they've also addressed the shutdown/sleep/hibernation issue. Based on the other reviews, it appears I may have just been a victim of poor timing.
