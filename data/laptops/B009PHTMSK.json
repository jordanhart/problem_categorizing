I mean I have the best connection in my house. all my iPads, iPhones and good old laptop never ever have any issues with my wireless-N router signals. everything is working just fine except this acer thing which is breaking connection every 5 minutes. interestingly i have observed that whenever i do stuff on the internet the frequency of breaking connection increases. as if it cant tolerate the 'load' of the data transfer. now please do not teach me the steps I should take to improve the signal and reception. the problem is with its hardware. in next few days I will decide whether or not it is worth living with this problem or just get rid of the headache once for all.update: downgraded to 1 star. Guys,  DO NOT BUY this piece of CRAP! I guess you get what u pay for.update: I was about to ship it back. i thought i should give it one more chance. so i chatted with customer service about this wifi issue. they said that it was a well known issue and had a simpler than expected fix. they forwarded me a link. i was supposed to uninstall the wifi driver and then reinstall it from the link. BOOM!!! Problem solved. now it is working like a charm. i am upgrading it to 4 stars. i would have given it 5 but this wifi thing was very inconvenient and acer should fix this problem so that it worked right out of the box.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price", "Author": "Blackberry7", "ReviewID": "R3DLK5JFRMIWCM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop on sale on another website. I thought the cpu - 1.5 ghz Pentium 987 dual core would be a little slow but truthfully it does quite well if you use this for basic document creation/editing and net surfing. The machine runs quietly and stays fairly cool. Reviews of other V5 laptops mention a problem with the wifi signal but I did not have that problem with my unit. Windows 8 is different but it's nothing you can't learn in a day or two. To minimize frustration go to the Windows app store and download the Windows 8 shortcuts app as soon as you set up the laptop. Note that this laptop does not have a touch screen so you manipulate everything from the touchpad or a mouse. The touchpad (smartpad) was great while it worked but it went crazy in just a few days and tweaking the settings did no good so I had to return the laptop. I will try a laptop with a faster cpu and touch screen next. Apart from the touchpad problem however, this Acer laptop is not a bad machine for the price.", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "this sucks", "Author": "daniel jimenez", "ReviewID": "R3RASTVGDENZ8C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "a half of star the dam thing dont work right and i call tech support and get the run around....", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW !", "Author": "garymetz \"reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2AF64OLNO19CD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything I ever wanted in a Laptop .
