Burrese \"Author, Speaker, Mediator, ...", "ReviewID": "RCTG7YW2ETLMC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony VAIO 14-Inch Laptop is a nice introductory computer. This isn't a high speed gaming computer, but it isn't priced like one either. It's sleek and stylish with a 14 inch screen, which puts is smaller than many, which depending on your preference is good or bad. Some people really like a larger screen, but then you have the larger computer. If you want a smaller one, this is a good deal.The keyboard lights up making it easy to use in the dark. The screen and picture are great, and it has good sound for a laptop. You can always hook up speakers if you want more.While a number of laptops no longer have optical disc drives, this laptop does. You can watch DVDs with the included CyberLink PowerDVD program, or you could load another player. You can burn CD and DVDs too.I really liked that it comes with different programs, especially Sony Movie Studio Platinum and Sound Forge Audio Studio. I had been planning to purchase Sound Forge, and it is nice to get it with this computer. I have not played with Movie Studio yet, but it looks like it will do some cool things with video. Acid Music Studio 9 also comes with the computer, but I have not really had time to check it out yet. And finally, it also comes with adobe Photoshop Elements 12 which is also a nice program to have included.I don't really like that mouse pad. Seemed to jump around on me. I like it better when I hook a mouse up to one of the USB ports. I also don't care for Windows 8 that much. I much prefer the older versions, so I guess that is something I have to get used to with this laptop.Overall I'm very happy with this computer. I think it will be great for doing some of the audio recording I'm planning, and I will try out the video tools as well. I don't know if the i3 processor will deal with video as fast as an i7 computer, but will have to find out.For writing, music, audio recordings, watching DVDs, or getting on the Internet, this laptop does a great job.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "my pleasure", "Author": "Alee", "ReviewID": "RX4WDFF0S2XCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had another Sony Vaio that was my favorite laptop of all times, that was stolen. I finally could afford another one and except for Microsoft bugging me to switch all my accounts to them (which finally stopped) it provides with the same smooth great performance. I have deleted/removed most of apps and now I am rolling with the experience. I am a very mild user (Office and Internet mostly) in fact and just need a good quality machine that is fast and smart - this is it!", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "that I loved. Purchased another brand", "Author": "Gabriele Blankenship", "ReviewID": "R3RQJ173TR7PMG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a Sony for many years, that I loved.  Purchased another brand, that broke down quickly and was in repair more often than not.  Went to a Mac due to frustration.  Now I had to download a program that is only Microsoft compatible and bought the Sony.  The 8.1 version has me confused as it is a hybrid of Mac and Microsoft.  I know it will take me a while to master, but it hasn't been easy so far.  I cannot blame it on Sony, but on the 8.1 version of Office.  It is completely different and revamped.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is my 3rd Sony Vaio laptop and it won't be my last.", "Author": "AJ", "ReviewID": "R19E9J2J3OBESC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the third Sony Vaio I've owned and my next laptop will likely be a Vaio as well.  They are just good, solid laptops.  This one suffers--through no fault of it's own--from having Windows 8 (which I hate) as it's operating system.As with my previous two Vaios, I'm not nuts about the keyboard.  If you like to use your computer in bed, the backlit keyboard is not going to be your friend.  Unless you get the angle just right, it can be hard to read the keys with the screen brightness and the backlit keyboard. I've also had issues with the keys themselves. On my first Vaio, two keys eventually broke off, and on my second, the coating wore off several of the keys (mostly vowels), and the texture wore off in spots on the touch pad.  I haven't had this new one long enough to know if it will have similar issues.One big change from my previous Vaio is that this one has no separate button under the touch pad, it's built into the touch pad itself.  I can't tell yet if I'm going to warm up to that change, but so far it still feels awkward.The weirdest thing was that it wouldn't let me install Norton.  Not from my disc or downloaded from the website.  I've never had an issue installing Norton on any of my computers (and I can't blame it on Windows 8 since Norton installed perfectly on my new desktop).  It was bizarre.Complaints aside, I still really love the laptops from Sony Vaio as they boot up faster than any other laptop I've owned and seem to always outlast my friends and family.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sweet little laptop.", "Author": "Kiki", "ReviewID": "RBP1AGTHCJ1J9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this slim and nice feeling little lap top. It has quick start up, and I really like that! It seemed like a luxury at first, but now that I'm used to it, i couldn't live without it.  It is a true time saver.The laptop itself is slim and light, only one inch thick, only 4.9 lbs.,and quite pretty: a very light shade of gray, almost white. A very classy look, according to my 17 year old daughter. I also actually enjoy the keyboard. Our old laptop is about three years old, and it doesn't feel anywhere as smooth or nice as this one. Even the keyboard feels clunky, where the Vaio has a lovely streamlined look and feel.I am slowly learning to tolerate Windows 8.1.  I know we'll all learn, but it is an experience. This particular model of the Fit laptop does NOT have a touch screen, but we do have a Vaio that does, and it is definitely easier to navigate throughout Windows 8.1 with the touch screen, but that still doesn't mean I really like it. I also greatly dislike the Hotmail app. SO annoying.As far as speed and storage on this unit, it is very good. It comes with a really nice Adobe Photoshop (Elements 12). My daughter has used it several times, and she felt really comfortable on it, and on this laptop. The screen is super clear HD and provides a lush, beautiful picture, and just the right size for a laptop. I certainly wouldn't want anything any bigger than this 14 inch laptop.I hope they start to include it in every model.  Perhaps it would be affect the battery life in this might?This particular model of the Fit does also NOT come with a back lit keyboard, which was a huge disappointment to us. That seemed like a really good feature that someone decided was too expensive for this particular model.I really love the touch pad, very responsive, most of the time, and everything is quite easy to adjust to your specific likes.I have yet to use some of the features, like the movie and music ones, from Sony, but the sound is quite good on this laptop, although I'd still use speakers to stream any amount of music.This laptop seems flexible and useful in so many ways.It has several different ports, and you can easily use it to charge your phone, even when the laptop itself is sleeping! Clever idea, great for emergencies. And of course, you can play cds and dvds in it, and burn them as well.This laptop has lots of storage space (500 GB hard drive)!  And a fast processor, the i3.  Bluetooth interface and a nice software package are included: With Sony Movie Studio Platinum, ACID Music Studio, Sound Forge Audio Studio, DVD Architect Studio, Adobe Photoshop Elements 12 and more. Includes 1-month trial of Microsoft Office 365.Another wonderful feature of the new Sony Vao computers (we have two) is the new ASSIST button. This button can be used to help you when something goes wrong with your computer, and even when it doesn't turn on correctly, it will rescue you!  It is also useful for regular maintenance. Very futuristic, the machine that repairs itself!I'm really happy with this Sony. The first computer we ever had was a Sony Vaio, back in the late 1990s. It was a premium product, and I feel like the company has managed to maintain that premium feel. I have always owned Sony products: I love Sony Walkman as a teen, and I've had several Sony digital cameras, as well, we love the Carl Zeiss lenses! So this pretty little laptop is a lovely addition to our family. )", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Customers service is a crap", "Author": "hazem", "ReviewID": "RZDR4LJTYA7QQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Customers service is a crapI bought this laptop few months ago,and i think it was the worst decision that i had made in my life,the screen get cracked spontaneously, and Sony refused to repair it.they have the worst customer service.i am not gonna buy any Sony product again.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Christianne", "ReviewID": "RHJ3JRS5G2LJI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Looks great, quite light in weight and easy to use..

Now they say it has been damaged and for them to repair per \"agreement\" it will cost me $470. The initial repairman said nothing about damage but all they say is that \"Our tech says there is damage and it is not covered\".  Really!! Damage all of a sudden appeared even though it was not working before and you don't acknowledge that  So all I can say is, DO NOT BUY ANY SONY VIAO COMPUTER.  I am now looking at buying another computer since I definitly am not paying to get that computer back and have another problem to go though this again.  It is just a wasted initial purchase of over $600 that I made, but don't make the same mistake.  We are mailing the \"damaged\" computer to the President of Sony Electronics in San Diego for a paperweight.  Stay away from Sony.  If I can help someone else avoid that problem then maybe that is why this happened to me.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i3-4005U 1.70 GHz\n4 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive0 GB Solid-State Drive\n14-Inch Screen\nThis SVF14322CXW does NOT have a touchscreen.", "Name": "Sony VAIO SVF14322CXW 14-Inch i3 Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41f%2BtrfOHfL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HF2LY9M"}}
