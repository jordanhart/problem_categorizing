{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great netbook", "Author": "Osudoc", "ReviewID": "R1TCBSGZGKFUD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased an HP 5103 netbook a few weeks ago after my year-old ASUS netbook died.  I tend to be rough with my laptops.  I travel quite a bit and so my laptops get bumped a lot.  I needed something sturdy.  So far, the HP 5103 has held up great.As soon as I took the netbook out of the box, I could tell that this machine was built better than my ASUS. The netbook casing is an aluminum-magnesium alloy.  And according to HP, the hard drive has a sensor that stops the drive from spinning to prevent damage in the event it is bumped or dropped.  Thank goodness.The keyboard is great.  There is a little space between each of the keys, which makes typing easier (at least for me). The netbook comes in \"espresso\" -- dark brown. The finish does not show off fingerprints like some other netbooks.I got the 6-cell battery.  I've gotten close to 9 hours of battery life doing basic word processing.Overall, I wanted a sturdy netbook with good battery life.  The HP 5103 has delivered on both ends.", "Date": "October 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "An Awesome Laptop at Great Price!!!", "Author": "Single Mother Of Two", "ReviewID": "R1M3K5XJ5Y6FE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Netbook is a perfect size to be carried around the whole day in my shoulder bag and used for 9 hours without me having to worry about it running out of battery like the regular size labtop that required charging every two hours of usage.  The espresso color is just beautiful.  The 250/2GB capability sealed the deal for me at this price.", "Date": "January 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not as fast as I expected", "Author": "Andris Madariaga", "ReviewID": "R1FMPSAZEATRPT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the first netbook from HP, the 2133 fully loaded, and it was a rocket (Vista Business, 1.6Ghz, 2Gb, and 7200rpm HDD), with this new business line model, I was looking for something equivalent, but didn't get a rocket this time.The boot time takes longer than my previous HP netbook, and the relation resolution/display size it's not good at all. With the new large task bar of Win 7 on the bottom or top, you loose valuable space of your screen, not mentioning that there are some dialog boxes that when pop-up, you are not able to see the buttons for the actions to be performed.I was looking for the higher resolution model, but didn't find it pre-built on Amazon, I needed with urgency, so I sacrificed that feature.I think that if you are buying a Business computer, you are allowed to pay 100 o 200 extra dollars to pay for extra-features.", "Date": "January 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Netbook is fine but battery.......", "Author": "Gabriela Astolfi", "ReviewID": "R3MDKC9M1EAJC0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received the mini 5103 and it was what I expected. The only problem is that it would not recognize the battery (\"no battery detected) and no matter what you do (update BIOS to 2013 version, uninstall ACPI, and every possible solution found in the web) it still does not recognize the battery.My recommendation: buy it if you do not mind expending quite a few extra bucks in an OEM battery or you are fine using the netbook plugged all the time", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "To Slow", "Author": "Steve & Marsha Basant", "ReviewID": "R3GW1N5YUOOFJQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Computer is pretty neat.
