{"Reviews": [{"Title": "PC to Mac", "Author": "NavySeal", "ReviewID": "R1IZQWJJ73YP8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying that I've been using PCs my whole life and I am now 17.  I decided to buy a Macbook Pro for college because I am going two years before I would have actually gone to college.  I was torn between the 15 inch and 13 inch.  I decided on the 15 inch because I do a lot of programming, mostly for fun, but I'm also on a robotics team, because I'm a Physics major.  I decided on the 15 inch model and I'm very happy that I did.  The screen size is perfect for extended periods of use while programming.  The free software on the Mac store called xCode is a great application.I've used PCs all of my life and the Mac OS is head over heels better than all of the Windows OS versions.  Although, Windows 7 is a much closer competitor.Parallels Desktop 7 allows you to run Windows 7 on your Mac also, this adds the best of both worlds.  Mac's killer OS and Windows' programs.Pros:Multitasking is AMAZING ON THE MAC!!!  I love it, Mac OS Lion is great in the ways of multitasking.It is extremely fast.The screen size is perfect.The Mac App Store is great.The keypad is backlit.Trackpad has amazing sensitivity.The battery life is good.Cons:It gets a bit hot on the bottom if it doesn't get proper ventilation.Glossy screen, but for me it isn't that bad.The fact that there is an App Store creates so many possibilities for the future of the Mac.  It also adds so many things you can do in the way of note taking, applications that help you brainstorm for writing papers.  It has been a big help with my 5 page essays.I would definitely recommend this for anybody who likes to program because the screen size is perfect for extended periods of use.  This is a great computer.  It would be even better if you have an iPad or iPhone.  If you have either of those than I would strongly suggest you get a Macbook because of the application compatibility.  This is a great computer and the pros heavily outweigh the cons.  The heat only happens if you have it suffocated by your lap.  This is a great computer and you should definitely get it for college, or any other work related things.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Get the 15\" it's worth it!", "Author": "LNC", "ReviewID": "R1VGQS8QAI27XE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 15\" is worth it, it's not too small or too big and heavy like the 17\". the 17 has it's place like home or office. the 13\" is slower, check out the i5-i7 spec's.

The old canard that it's more expensive than equivalent Windows laptops just isn't true.  You have to dig into the specs of this thing to really make a comparison.  But that's irrelevant, let's talk about the laptop itself.The good* Very nice graphics.  When plugged in you get nice HD video from an AMD 6490M (when you're plugged in) or from an Intel 3000HD when on battery.* Multi touch (well almost) trackpad.  It's missing a couple of things from the huge Magic Trackpad from Apple, but it has everything I can use.  I can really maneuver around the computer with my trackpad.* Brilliant screen, 1440X900, absolutely HD.* OSX 10.7 Lion.  Really the best OSX by far, and amazing what it can do.* Speedy quad-core i7 processor.  My massive Excel spreadsheets recalc fast.  And working with Photoshop and Aperture show no issues whatsoever.  This laptop really can be considered a mobile desktop.* Beautiful aluminum case.  Just makes it feel expensive.  (One note, aluminum does bend easily, so if you're rough with your computer, get one of those protective skins.)* Nice built-in camera for video chatting, Skype or other things.* Easy to upgrade to 8GB memory.  And you can get it for a lot less than Apple charges.Not so good* I'm not a big fan of the speakers.  They don't put out very much sound, even at full blast.  It's kind of hard to watch movies without a headset.* The hard drive is light for the price.  Amazon sells 1TB 2.5\" hard drives for a good price, but upgrading the hard drive takes some skill to do it right.Overall, I am very happy with the laptop.  I use it for everything from basic web browsing to photo editing to business work.  I have had a lot of MacBooks, so I guess I'm not only used to them, I know how to get the most of them.

Very satisfied so far.  Feels like the sturdiest, best designed laptop I've ever owned.My only complaint is that as of today (09/19/2011), Amazon's product description states that \"This Mac comes pre-installed with OS X Snow Leopard, but you can order a free upgrade to OS X Lion...\"  In fact, it ships with Lion pre-installed.  Dozens (if not hundreds) of major 3rd party applications have yet to announce compatibility with Lion, so this can be a significant issue for quite some time.  Amazon is not \"set up\" to do something as simple as send a customer an OS install disc to fix a problem clearly caused by their own product data.Long story short, I did call Apple and, as it's still under warranty, they dropped a Snow Leopard disk in the mail and will be here in 2-3 days.I requested that Amazon change the product description, so I'll update this review as soon as it's published.", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Upgraded from MBP 13", "Author": "Art", "ReviewID": "R9YIGDKO5ZW5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The 13 inch MBP 2010 was my first mac and I thought it was the best laptop I ever used. Recently I got a special deal on the MBP 15 inch 2011 and decided to upgrade although the price of this thing is quite  high. Right away I busted this thing open, took out the DVD drive and installed a INTEL 120 GB SSD drive in it's place. Now I have 2 drives. The SSD is for OS X + software and the 500 GB spinning HD is for video since I use this to edit HD video H.265 filesAll I can say is that it made quite a difference after the switch from 13 inch. Running Premiere CS5.5 is much more spaced out and comfortable on the 15 inch. Much faster processor too.Internally the MBP 13 uses 1 fan and a small speaker attached to the main board. The 15 inch has 2 fans and 2 real speakers. There are other additions but you can look at apple's site yourself if you want to compare the models.With the SSD drive installed, my applications load instantly and everything is faster than a Macbook Air.Although I was loyal to Windows and PC all my life, I can now tell you that the average user would fall in love with OS X Lion compared to using Windows. Windows is sloppy, virus prone and doesn't operate smoothly with its hardware as Mac products do. I used many windows laptops and they all feel cheap and the trackpad always sucks no matter how expensive the unit is. Lots of people around me switched to Mac after playing with my laptop. A granny can learn to use a new mac in 1 hour while a PC might get tossed out the window.I know you've heard it before but I switched to Mac and don't plan on going back to PC.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Apple MacBook Pro 15.4\" widescreen", "Author": "kjsand", "ReviewID": "RQUB00VJBPM8M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I LOVE this MacBook Pro !, after having nothing prior but PC's this was a big step to take. I figured that since I already own an iPhone4 and several iPods my learning curve wasn't going to be insurmountable.Since this purchase I haven't touched or missed my old PC with Microsoft's CONSTANT and annoying security updates.I'll NEVER go back to a PC, in fact I'm currently trying to decide which iMac that I want for a desktop", "Date": "July 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "It's Hard To Give A Complete Review Of A Notebook", "Author": "Mister Murse", "ReviewID": "R2IBXAWR86PKXL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "There are many different factors to consider when writing a review of a notebook, but I'm just going to go with the topics hardware and software.First, the exterior/hardware. This is the first thing that you see when unboxing so it only felt right to start here. Of course when you open it you're in the awe of actually owning an Apple machine. The aluminum unibody is extremely attractive, clean, and just stunning. Then more time sets in, and if you're like me, you begin to inspect it, wondering if it really is as perfect as you first thought it to be. Upon inspection of this machine (my 1st of two, BTW) I noticed there were some flaws. First, I noticed when the lid was closed, there was a gap on the right side (the drive side) compared to the left. Upon further inspection, eyeballing at an angle I find hard to describe, I can see an imperfection in the form of the aluminum, as if it was bent. Secondly, after some use, I also noticed two of the backlighting on the keys, keys 'B' and '7' were noticeably dimmer than their counterparts. Lastly, upon inspecting the powercord, it looks like there are some imperfections in the sheathing...I don't know from what or how, but just another thing to make my mind boggle. For a machine of this price and from a company like Apple where form and function are supposedly equal, I personally could not 'suck it up' and live with these things, but I'm sure there are those out there who would...to each is own. But other than those things, it definitely is a striking machine that leaves an impression.Second, the software. Being this is my first time owning an Apple and working with OS X, I have to say I am pleased right from the get go. It truly is simple to use. I don't know how else to explain it, but I've been using Windows for years, and after a short time, a couple weeks on a Mac, I feel quite oriented with it. Setting up things seem much less painful on a Mac, as the system often recognizes things in advance, ie setting up an internet connection. For the experienced, not impressive by any means, but for those who have trouble fathoming wireless anything, it works like it's supposed to without needing to be \"experienced.\" I'm sitting here trying to think of a more compelling example to share, but all I can really tell you is that things work in a straight forward way. Recalling my Windows experiences, there are often multiple sidesteps that would be taken to finally reach a certain destination, but here its a straight shot.Personal experience: As stated above, due to the hardware issues/imperfections, I bought a second MacBook Pro and returned the first one. I truly love my second one, as all the hardware imperfections are no longer there...the lid is even all the way around, the backlights work on all the keys, the power cord doesn't have any weird marks. I'm happy. I will say though, I don't know if Amazon was trying to be slick or if it's common practice, but the box this 2nd one came in I noticed had been opened before and a new clear piece of tape was placed over it. I'm not entirely sure what that means? I will also say too that the first one ran much cooler, as this one seems a bit warmer...(uh oh, did I make things worse for myself?) Not hot enough where I feel like I'm getting burned, but noticeably warmer...but I have read things about 'thermal paste' on these MBPs being excessively used, so I'm not sure...have to look further into that. But all in all, this is what I initially expected, form and function are top notch, as they should be to match the cost.MBP #1: 3 starsMBP #2: 4/4.5 stars (Would be 5 stars if it operated at the same cooler temperature as the first one)", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "VERY FRUSTRATED", "Author": "Jack Carter", "ReviewID": "R1OYZYG30XPMWG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "right out of the box the wireless card did not work.

The closest I got to a Mac was in school and I thought they were terrible.Back to 2011, I felt the need to buy a new laptop to replace my existing Windows 7 laptop (i wanted a sandy bridge and faster laptop). I was hesitant at first because of the ridiculous pricing but this macbook pro changed my mind entirely of my perception of macs.The laptop finishes booting up a few seconds quicker than my Acer laptop and the user interface was beautiful in its simplicity. This is the key word here folks: simplicity. Windows involve more menu clicking and finding compared to a Mac. Dont get me started on the screen, WOW! My eyes WILL get used to this when studying. In fact, it will make studying easier because the screen doesnt have dull areas like on my acer. Now the trackpad, it is the best trackpad I have used. You can move on the trackpad and click simultaneously without letting go of your finger. I like the chiclet keys plus the backlighting LED makes it look cool. The side speakers have incredible volume that I actually have to LOWER the volume because it was just too loud! My acer's volume fail in comparison but Acer's laptop have a smaller speaker.Overall:Apple Macbook Pro design is sophisticated, clean, and functional.

I was also considering the 13\" MacBook Pro and the Dell XPS15z. All of them are worthy laptops. I was attracted to the XPS as it is very well priced and a great looking laptop. But in the end I stuck with Mac. I have been a Mac user since about 2002. So, all my private software etc is Mac. Switching back to Windows would have been a struggle as much of the software is not available on Windows and if it is, the look and feel and functionality is a step down from Mac. So then had to decide on whether I go for the 13\" or not. I have always had the 13\" models. In the end I went for the 15\" because the sound is better and the sheer power of the laptop is brilliant.

I always wanted to make the switch to mac from pc, but never had the funds. This year I will be attending college so it was mandatory to buy a laptop. I did some research and it was final I was getting a Macbook Pro. I thought about buying the higher end model (2.2, 6750m) , but I will not be doing any heavy gaming so the base model was fine with me. So far is awesome. The glare isn't nearly as bad as people say, and the screen is the beautiful! The 500GB 5400rpm HDD is very snappy and I don't think I will be upgrading to a 7200rpm or SSD anytime soon.

I had sold my last Macbook (White polycarbonate) to go traveling and bought a Dell instead. It wasn't the brightest idea I've ever had. My Dell wasn't an entry level laptop it was actually the XPS M1330 with all the options. After upgrading to Win7 I thought my laptop was fast enough and the screen was bright and crisp. After breaking it I decided it was time to go back to a mac. I wasn't disappointed.This laptop can run laps around my Dell. Paired with a Seagate Momentus XT 500 GB 7200RPM SATA 3Gb/s 32 MB Cache 2.5 Inch Solid State Hybrid Drive ST95005620AS-Bare Drive This laptop is faster than most $2300+ Windows computers and outperforms any windows pc in terms of start up/standby/resume/shutdown speed. I find that the graphics switching helps keep the laptop cool and the fan quiet under normal web browsing and document drafting. 3D drawings load quickly and you rarely find any lag while working on large 3D projects.I only carry the charger everywhere with me because I never know when I'm going to be spending extra time in the library or spending all day away from home. However I rarely find that I need to plug in during a normal day of classes and some study time inside the library. In case you need to fuel up between meetings and whatnot the battery charges to 80% fairly quickly.Usability is greatly improved over Windows machines with the extra large trackpad that conveniently doesn't get in the way while you're typing on the full size keyboard that is a joy to type on. I find that with the keys the way they're designed has me typing ~10 WPM more than other less intuitively designed keyboards. The backlight in the keys also help when you're on a plane or other dark places like certain lecture halls. It does however eat up more juice than I'd like.If your anticipating on doing more Graphics design or 3D drawing I would suggest upgrading to the Apple MacBook Pro MC723LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop otherwise this will be more than plenty to satisfy the general user and student.

I purchased my 13 back in September and about 6 months later I saw the new MacBook pros came out and comparing the specs I felt like I needed to upgrade. I replaced my 2010 Macbook Pro 13 with this and I must say that I am very pleased. The dual core on the 2010 seemed fast but when compared to the i7 quad core the dual core isn't even in the same universe! The 15' is super fast and great at handling multiple apps at once. The new Lion OSX is excellent and apple has added  a lot of things to make this os superb to others. The only drawback is that Apple has axed rosetta which means power pc run applications and games are no longer supported. However I like the fact that if needed you can add windows via bootcamp (if you want to play pc games or need to use apps that are not compatible with macs). The battery life on this laptop is great. I can usually get 6 to 8 hours of life from a single charge depending on what I am doing. Most laptops can only get 3 or 4 max. The battery can actually be calibrated to help get the most out of a charge. Ilife 11 is a great addition with this laptop and apps like iMovie and iPhoto couldn't be easier to use. Portability isn't as good as the 13' but with this computer being pretty much 2x-3x faster that the 2010 13' I'm not complaining. Overall I am extremely pleased with my purchase and if your thinking about converting to a Mac, DO IT! You will be very satisfied.PROS1. The processor is a super fast 2.0 ghz quad core i7 great for gaming on bootcamp or on lion (2x-3x faster than previous generations).2. The battery life is great. ( A little less than my 2010 13' mbp but it averages about 6 to 8 hours a charge depending on what I'm doing so I'm not complaining)3. Osx Lion is a great upgrade from snow leopard and does a great job at keeping everything organized and fast.4. Great apps included like Garageband and iPhoto.5. The case looks very sleek, thin, and professional and the backlit keyboard can be super bright or dim depending on how you want it.6. Bootcamp is a great feature that many people may not know used to run windows on your mac if needed. 7. The screen is extremely bright and big and hd videos look crisp and clear.CONS1.

I also do a lot of photography and developing pics is just an out of the world experience on Mac. The screen is so vibrant that the pics almost speak out.

It does take a little getting used to if you aren't familiar with Macs, but once you get a good feel for where everything is located you realize that the system is much more intuitive and geared to the user than windows. The battery life is outstanding, the processor is incredibly fast, and if you get a solid state hard drive the thing is indestructible.

From what I understand from talking to her, most universities have a large open pit in which they stone the students who arrive for their freshman year with PCs.  It's all about cool and image.

While I have yet to see what that extra thousand bucks gets you, it did buy me freedom from at LEAST a year of griping and foul moods from my daughter.

A dongle, what is this 1988?3) One day the battery will conk out and because of Steve Jobs' neurotic tick about external batteries, I'll have to shell out 250 bucks or so to get a new one.

I needed a Macbook Pro with a built in optical drive due to the nature of of my work so I didn't want to get the latest model of the Macbook Pro.  Although this review is not for the seller, I will just say that this laptop was in pristine condition and everyone that I have shown it to says that it looks brand new.That said, the Quad Core i7 in this machine is perfect.  The only thing i did is upgrade the RAM.  It is very fast for all tasks and I do a lot of media heavy (i.e. - audio and video editing) things that require a lot.  Is it a Mac Pro?  Certainly not, but by necessity I do much of my work on the go and a desktop is out of the question most of the time.Even though this machine is a couple years old it has more than enough horsepower for 99.9% of standard computer users and even though for power users.  If you want the latest/greatest like Retina display, thinner, lighter, then this isn't for you, but if you want an laptop with a built in optical drive that still delivers on the power side, this Macbook Pro definitely delivers.  I got my unit for just over $1000 which I felt was a great deal, especially given the perfect condition.
