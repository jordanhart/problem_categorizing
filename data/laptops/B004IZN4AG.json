I've owned it for a little over a month now, so I think it would be fair to say I can assess its tru value at this point. I was impressed by the specs, looks, and size, and for the price (including free xbox with amazon student deal) it really can't be beat in the ultraportable market. I would recommend anyone considering a Sony, Apple, or Samsung ultraportable look into this model as well.I was looking for something this size and weight, with decent specs, but not a blazingly fast, top-of-the line performer. I'm used to the $2000 and up, upgraded Macbook Pros, so I know performance and reliability when I see it, and this thing meets my expectations and more.Pros:Perfect size and shape (same thickness and weight as 2010 Macbook Air)Plenty fast and reliable (though not an i7, or 2011 MBA)Great looks (I actually prefer the flat rounded-smooth shape and color instead of Macbook)Very nice keys trackpadDecent screenDecent WebcamGood software included (Good version of Windows 7 64-bit, Little bloatware)Cons:Keyboard not backlit (I still look at my keys sometimes, so typing in dark is hard)No SD card slot (Not a dealbreaker obvuiously, but would have been nice)Battery underwhelming (2.5 to 4 hours isn't bad, but competitors are getting 9 from a charge)Unless you are a superuser, and you need gaming on the go, or video and music editing, this will be more than enough for you. If you want to be doing very processor intensive tasks, then ultraportable probably isn't your class anyway.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Light and good look, but a bit too slow", "Author": "Chi Li", "ReviewID": "RBKWVJ7W2T2RK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro: Love the design, and the screen is amazing.

Speed is not exceptional but is adequate for its class. the keyboard felt really good and the system is really queit. I looked at the specs and was really good.Here are the cons:When I bought the system I read it could go up to 8gb! but the system I have only can stay at 4gb! it suppose to have 2 slots of memory! but after calling Lenova I found out that not all models have that! So! its a big Minus to me when I try to upgrade the memory .Access to HD and memory is really difficult. since it is kind of a self contain unit and not able to change things out.3rd issue is the battery cannot be easily change !have to pretty much strip the unit to get to it! if you do decide to have a spare! since the battery life on this unit is not impressive! rated at 4hr! but I am getting more like 3 hr max!Overall! was a bit dissapointed with some of these items I mentioned! other than that! I loaded up Office 2007, Adobe Photoshop CS5, and even run some of my game well.DaveC", "Date": "September 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Poor product and poor repair service", "Author": "Kelly", "ReviewID": "RGVBMU6MDHB8T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop 5 months ago. I loved the color and thinness of the laptop. At 33 days old, it would not start up at all and had to be sent in for repair. It was returned not properly functioning, so it had to be sent back. Now 4 months after that the hard drive has to be replaced again. I have purchased many brands of laptops and have never had any problems within the first 2 years. This laptop is awful and the customer service is worse. Please reconsider making this purchase. I had heard good things about Lenovo products, but I regret buying this laptop. I am already in the market for a new computer 5 months after my purchase because this product is too unreliable for a law student, and I am only certain of one thing my new laptop will not be a Lenovo.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Unbelieveable...", "Author": "L.

In fact, I prefer many of it's qualities to the more current MacBooks.  For one, the use of a matte screen is extremely welcome. Secondly, this notebook has superb ergonomics and a warm, tactile quality that is indeed very book-like - from the exterior metal covers and their soft, grippable texture to the leather-like palm-rest and silky smooth trackpad.  The clever use of all these various materials and treatments to enhance the user experience is quite well done and the size and weight seem ideal.  There is certainly an Apple-like attention to detail but I think the actual feel and look of this notebook is the polar opposite to that of current Mac's, which can come off as cold and sterile. Anyway, there are a few con's, as well as a few things that could have been executed just a little bit better.  First up, the battery life is only about 3 hours.  Combine the short battery life with the use of a standard HD (instead of a SSD) and I have to wonder just how much more battery life could have been achieved had Lenovo used a SSD.  I also think the screen, while nice, could have been a little better with regard to viewing angle.  For instance, it's nowhere near the quality of my ancient Powerbook G4 and it's Samsung-made screen, though, in fairness, no current Apple screen - matte or glossy - is that good either.  The other cons come with the thin and light aspect I suppose.  First, there are limited ports and there is no card reader.  Secondly, upgrading this Notebook with, for instance, an SSD drive, or replacing the internal battery will require disassembly of the bottom half of the laptop. Overall, though, I believe this is one very nice notebook.", "Date": "March 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lenovo good as usual", "Author": "Hashem Ali A.

When I sent it in for warranty repair, they kept it for 3 weeks (not including shipping time) before shipping it back and telling me that they couldn't replace the hard drive because I \"installed Linux on it.\" This was absolutely not the problem, as I completely wiped the hard drive before sending it to them, and it still failed almost instantly using the manufacturer's diagnostic utility. Rather than spend the effort to fight them on it and spend another month without a computer, I just bought a replacement drive and installed it myself. This fixed my problem, but also voided the warranty (big mistake). I should note that this was not Lenovo directly, but rather the company they contracted to do warranty repair, but still.After 6 months, the display failed. It would still output video, but the output was duplicated across the screen at lower resolution, making it completely unusable. Since I usually use an external monitor, I was annoyed by this, but not enough to pay to replace it. At 7 months it stopped turning on completely. Warranty repair was refused, and I ended up buying a new computer. They offered to repair it for less than the cost of the replacement, but I was not about to give them another penny for this piece of crap.So I would not recommend this computer at all. It's a piece of junk that breaks very quickly, and they will weasel their way out of warranty repairs with bs excuses and by making the process so time consuming and difficult that you will give up.", "Date": "April 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Graphics card died after two months of light use.", "Author": "A.D", "ReviewID": "R2YC64922P6OS3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I usually disdain writing reviews in general, but I am compelled to do so on this one. This computer is a piece of junk, period! The video card failed on me after two months of just light use from doing basic research online. I called Lenovo and it turned out that Lenovo contracted their services to another company. If you want to cry about their products, good luck on that one. I had to purchase a new netbook and will send out this piece of junk back to Lenovo for repair. The rep told me that a tech will take a look at the laptop to determine if it is a genuinely defect or due to my fault. Wow! I was speechless and not to mention pissed-off. Of course, the rep wasn't a Lenovo's employee per se so I just didn't want to take my frustrations out on the poor guy who works oversea. Take note of this Lenovo! I will continue to write a distasteful review if my laptop is not going to be repaired right.

The last PC I purchased was a Dell back in '03. Since then I have used nothing but Macs at home and at work. I bought this nice little notebook today. The Lenovo looked perfect. The perfect screen size for me, perfect weight, the keyboard was fantastic and really, it's just a well manufactured PC laptop. i was very happy with my purchase.So I charged the puppy up and started my computing. My first foray into the world of Windows in so many years was underwhelming. I found the OS to be confusing and slow. For example, to update Windows, I had to go to the Start Menu>Accessories>Windows Update> and then click \"Update Windows\". A really long process compared with Apple>System Update. Another example is the icons when Alt+Tab (switching between programs). The icons on Windows 7 are actual real-time representations of the programs, and not the icons of the programs like in OSX. Extremely confusing when switching programs.It's not fair for me to give this computer less of a rating because of it's operating system. After all, millions of people use Windows 7 and are just fine with it. But if you are a Mac user who is looking for a comparable version of the MacBook Air or MacBook, this might be a good choice if it weren't for the OS and a couple of other things.A note about the hardware, it is BEAUTIFUL. The textured, almost leather-like skin is amazing to touch, the keyboard is perfectly in place, the unit is perfectly constructed, solid and appears to be of fantastic quality. A truly amazingly designed unit. My only peeves about the actual computer is the trackpad and the battery life.The trackpad suffers from not being Mac-like. It is small and has no gestural functions, which is unacceptable for me. The battery only gave me 2.2 hours at the default settings and a full charge. Know that there is NO optical drive and NO removable battery. So you'll be taking this thing in for a battery change.All-in-all, if you like Windows 7, and like your computer to be solid and small, this is your laptop.So sadly, after 2 hours, I am returning my Lenovo. I'll be getting a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro upon return.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004IZN4AG"}}
