{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Highest Performance Laptop I could Ask For", "Author": "rabidreader \"rabidreader\"", "ReviewID": "R13SNYZAZ4VKPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having this laptop a few days, I am ecstatic about it's performance. My work typically involves me opening anywhere up to like 30 tabs at once, and this doesn't impact the speed of processes at all. It may be a bit pricey for all tastes, but it is worth every dollar.The keyboard is also nice, responsive and well spaced between letters.Only thing that I'm not too pleased about is the responsive of the touchpad (which seems a tad sluggish). Sometimes I end up tapping 3 or 4 times for a click. But all in all, that won't keep me back from my work.Awesome, two thumbs up", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,645.00", "Features": "Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit; 4th Gen Intel Core i7-4702MQ (2.2GHz-3.2GHz) Quad Core CPU\n15.6\" diagonal LED-backlit HD anti-glare (1366 x 768); Intel HD Graphics 4600; VGA; HDMI\n128GB Solid State (SSD) Performance Hard Drive; 8GB DDR3L 1600MHz SDRAM (2 Dimm)\n802.11b/g/n & Bluetooth 4.0; 720p HD Webcam & Dual Array Microphone; DTS Sound+\nFull-sized, spill-resistant keyboard; 2 USB 3.0, 2 USB 2.0; Gigabit LAN; 1 Year HP Warranty", "Name": "HP ProBook 450 G1 Series 15.6\" Quad Core Windows 7 Professional Business Notebook PC (Intel Core i7-4702MQ, 128GB Solid State Performance Hard Drive, Win 7 Pro Laptop, 8GB RAM)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419JeLtUatL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00JHE36S8"}}
