I wanted to stick with HP because of my previous experiences with this brand. I was really excited when my new laptop arrived, and after the initial installation, I realized that the Wi-Fi Strength signal was really low (1 bar and sometimes the computer couldn't find the network) compared to the old Pavilion (it's 4 years old and it has 4 bars and sometimes 5).I thought it was something related with the drivers, and after I finished doing the updates (Windows and HP), the problem persisted.I contacted HP Tech Support (Chat and Phone) and they did the whole remote connection (when someone access to your PC via Internet)  and tried to resolve the problem (ip renew, ip release, checked the router, re install the drivers), yet the issue was still there. They also asked me to open my new laptop (screwdrivers and everything) to make sure the Wi-Fi was placed correctly. I did everything, but guess what? Problem was still there.After 4 hours with Tech Support, their conclusion was that my old laptop had a better wireless card because it was custom made. Therefore my Wireless reception was stronger. My response was, \"I cannot conceive that an old notebook is better than a new one with the top-notch technology.\" I packed it and sent it back to Amazon.PS: It was my first time returning an item, and kudos to Amazon for helping me with this issue.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Product", "Author": "Sharleen Annese \"grammaneesey\"", "ReviewID": "R2KMWSWTAJ76TB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Terrific computer, keyboard is very responsive and easy to type on.

I didn't mind waiting. I was hesitant to get a laptop over a desktop but I'm glad I went with the laptop. For the price and what this has to offer it's perfect for me that is. I also only like HP products. They seem to work well with me since my Packard Bell days. Aging myself.  Well I've had this laptop for a little more than a week and did have a few issues. I tried to load an old version of Microsoft Word and Excel and it didn't like it. Gave me error messages. Then Norton wanted to fix the problem. I just uninstalled it and Norton was happy again. Here are my pros and cons.Cons: Windows 8 is hard if you don't watch the videos or tutorials. I watched them because I read a few reviews on people getting frustrated from going from one screen to the desktop and getting lost. I find Windows 8 easy now. So I don't know if this is really a con. Mouse or pad is very touchy and times it jumps but this is a problem with all laptops.  My wife has a Toshiba and it does the same thing. Important software has to be either purchased or rented monthly or yearly. This is how Microsoft gets everyone. It's not HP. I'm trying it for free for the next 30 days.Pros: To many to list. Screen is large and able to adjust brightness. Sounds come through the speakers really nice at times I have to lower the volume. Very fast when you turn it on so you can start working. I takes about 10 seconds or a bit more but not much to get to the sign on screen and your there. You can see the system is still loading after you sign on and your at the apps window but you can start working. Over all it's an excellent choice for the price.If I had to buy another laptop this would be the one again. My wife wanted this one and would give me her's. Like I said I'm an old Packard Bell man who fell in love with HP. Sorry honey this one is for me. I stuck to my guns this time. Like I tell everyone who is looking for a desktop or laptop first see what your budget is and then start doing your research. It took me 2 months to get this after researching and I'm glad I waited. Good luck and I hope this helped.Enjoy", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Falls Short of What I know HP is capable of.", "Author": "Frank Nunez \"hypernez\"", "ReviewID": "R1D5TZ5QLFTMQS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "At first you think this is a good buy. Then you start Playing with it. You are tempted to return it, but if you get used to the changes, you will start thinking it is a good buy after all.HP has changed the display technology. This new technology is supposed to recognize more colors, however, when you turn up the brightness or the contrast, or the Gamma (In Graphics Properties)the whites in the display turn yellow. You can get them back to white by reducing the settings on brightness, gamma, and contrast. You have to play with it using several programs such as Microsoft Office, Power DVD, and watching the Desktop to hit a happy medium.  The settings I have found to be closest all around are: Brightness, -10, Contrast 49-50, Gamma 1.0, Hue 0, Saturation -25. You just right click on the desktop, and select Graphics Properties, then select Color Enhancement. Don't forget to save the changes.Windows 8 has a learning curve of about 4-8 hours of playing with it(depending on your level of Windows experience) in order to find where Microsoft has hidden all the controls you were familiar with in Windows 7.It does seem to be faster than the older models with Windows 7. You have to get used to pushing the power button to wake it from sleep or hibernation. Older models used to wake by opening the lid. In order to get to the Dos Commands such as regedit or winconfig, you simply type them on the keyboard when the Windows 8 Display is active. I use the older Windows 7 display as it is more easily configurable. You have to get used to placing your mouse pointer in the corners for the different displays such as New Windows Desktop, or System settings.Windows 8 try's to force you to use Microsoft Outlook for any mail programs.It try's to automatically load your mail settings by typing in your email address and hit continue. However it won't load Roadrunner Mail settings automatically. You can manually enter them and then the mail system works just fine.Once you get the adjustments for the display adjusted, this laptop is faster on Movies, and playing videos. It recognizes all Audio formats. It doesn't come with any Blu-Ray programs or Systems that will recognize Blu-ray DVD's. You can add a USB external Blu-ray Player/Recorder and install The latest CyberLink Suite and it recognizes, burns, and plays Blu-Ray media just fine. I found this is much less expensive than buying the Blu-Ray Models that can cost almost twice what this one costs. For the money, this laptop is a good value considering what else is on the market.", "Date": "February 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT!!!", "Author": "HuffDaddy2530", "ReviewID": "R1S597FH3ZBB5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best laptop I've ever owned.

highly addictive blackberry playbooks - for the last 2 years, and so found windows 8 interface very easy to use and intuitive. if you dont yet have a tablet, just play with windows 8. after all, it is more like windows 7 with a new start menu and apps.the new windows start menu is cool looking, with has large tile, which are very easy to use for all your regular tasks. just leave all the heavy-lifting to the old desktop interface. once you begin playing with this new os, you'll see it is not a big deal. in fact, it is not a problem at all.however, there are many problems that come with windows 8.  there are hundreds of crappy apps which install themselves  immediately. upon restart, they waste no time, and go out collecting and sending your data. they do it all behind your back and without your consent. microsoft feels free to impose them on you, without asking. and it can do so, thanks to the capabilities of w8, and no laws to stop microsoft.amazingly, these companies collect and sell your data, and then try to make you believe they are giving you something for nothings. do not trust them! in fact, it is you who gives them a lot for nothing. they install these \"free\" apps to gain access to your data, and to convince to pay a lot of money for the worthless software. information is power, just ask google guys.as always, do your homework before considering an hp envy, or any other laptop for that matter. if you are not at all concern about privacy, security, bugs, warms, trojan horses, viruses, spiders and spies - then, by all means check out dv7. otherwise, it is probably much wiser to look elsewhere. maybe seek out another manufacture/model that could be shipped to you with a minimum amount of bloatware.between unwanted hp crap and microsoft crap and other providers crap, it is an uphill battle to secure your data and your laptop. hp is the manufacturer who controls the process, and hp is clearly at fault here. if hp disclosed the risks involved in getting their laptops, i would have never bought this envy. maybe it is called envy because you will envy anyone who does not have to waste their time with hp bloatware. now, since hp bundles made this laptop into a security risk, it is going back to hp.good luck to all!", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not an hardware issue", "Author": "English_Wolf", "ReviewID": "RFU1ULMWEX7DU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this product and sent it right back when I realized it had window 8 and cannot be downgraded.I assume that HP has created a good laptop, they usually do but the OS is a total downer.", "Date": "January 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY", "Author": "Unsatisfied", "ReviewID": "R275MWAMB2K8MS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased my HP DV7 refurbished in mid November. I was assured that the laptop would hold up well, and do everything I needed it to. Now it's late December and I find that the laptop does not recognize the integrated webcam anymore, and the HP help section does not give a feasible resolution to this problem. Then today, the computer crashed mysteriously. Fortunately it started right back up, but it's even slower than when I first bought it. I should also mention that when I first bought it it had 4Gb RAM, and I upgraded that to 8Gb. Let me be clear, it is slower than when it had the 4Gb as of right now. To make matters worse, I bought the laptop because I was moving to Africa and needed something that was new and should hold up. Looks like I'm just SOL, because I don't think HP is going to be willing to have it shipped to be fixed. Good job making a terrible product HP, it looks like your general reputation is well deserved. Next time I'll just buy a pile of rusty nails and be done with it. Thanks a lot.Update 12/30/2012Since the last review I have also found that either the CD rom or Windows Media Player itself is having trouble reading audio CDs. This is a terrible product. DO NOT BUY.Update 01/25/2012Since the last update I have corresponded through email with HP customer service representatives via email several times. Unfortunately, they are unable to make long distance phone calls, so if I am to speak with a representative I have to foot the bill for that. They have also let me know that if I would like to have the laptop repaired I will be responsible for the bill to ship piece of junk to the US, which I will not do as I have already paid entirely too much for this computer.
