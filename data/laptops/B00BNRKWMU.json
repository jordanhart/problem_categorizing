But thought I'd include it here to help.Update 04-22-2014: About a year old now and this is still going strong.  I've just upgraded the HD to 1 TB Samsung SSD SATA Samsung Electronics 840 EVO-Series 1TB 2.5-Inch SATA III Single Unit Version Internal Solid State Drive MZ-7TE1T0BW and another 1 TB mSATA SSD Samsung Drive Samsung 840 EVO MZ-MTE1T0BW 1TB mSATA Internal SSD Single Unit Version for 2 TB of SSD.  (one of the advantages of being able to upgrade the components).  It's also running with 16 GB RAM.  I have the mini docking station HP (D9Y32UT#ABA) UltraSlim Dock 2013 Docking Station for EliteBook Folio 9470m Notebook which I wasn't going to get originally, but it is great and simple to use, one quick connect.  I have 3 monitors going, 2 24\" HP widescreen monitors HEWLETT CPQ LA2405x 24 LED Monitor - A9P21A8ABA and the laptop screen.  (One monitor is using the display port, the other using the SVGA port, both off the docking station.I also purchased the extra battery slice 2QN9167 - HP BA06 Long Life Battery for extra time.  Keep in mind, the docking station does not support having the extra battery in place, you have to remove it which is a nuisance, so I usually don't have the battery slice on.  I will take it only if I know I'll be away from a power source for a long period of time.  Also to note, the battery can't be charged without it being attached to the laptop.  The battery adds what feels to be 2/3 of the laptop weight and height, although the edges are tapered, but provides around 15 hours which includes using the existing laptop battery that came with it.Previous Update: I've upgraded the SSD to a 512GB and I'm loving the quick response and large capacity it now offers.  Makes quick work of video rendering also, very little heat noted also.Original Post / Impressions:I would rate this more a 4.5  This laptop has it all.  I'm going to review this a bit backwards with what I don't like first, because there's so much I do like.Fan noise loud (It seems to run constantly, even when I'm just browsing.  Yes, running as I type this review).Screen Resolution seems limited considering the resolution screens are coming out with today.Missing touch screen capabilities and Stylus, so all windows 8 perks would be lost.My first thought unboxing this was how large this is.  I'm use to a 13\" ultrabook.Part of me wishes it came in a 13\" model, but the 14\" is growing on me.  This is thin and very solidly built.HP has answered basically every issue I've had with existing ultrabooks on the market these days with the above exceptions.  Most laptops are always missing a few of these features below, but not this one.Backlit keyboard - yesFull SD Card Slot - yes, no usb card reader neededBig touch pad - yes, also nice size wrist/palm rest.VGA port - yes, no dongles neededNetwork port - yes, no usb adapters neededUser Expandable!!!!!!RAM, up to 16 GB (2 Slots)HD (If you want to exchange for a larger SSD)Battery can be swapped out.Comes with an option for an extended battery (haven't seen yet, but supposedly thin and clamps to the bottom to provide almost 20hrs work time so probably more like 12-14 hrs real time, but that's all day computing without plugging in.Nice featuresDedicated Mute buttonBio metric readerFilled only 1 of 2 RAM slots, one slot remains open, so to expand to 8 GB, you do not need to purchase 2 4 GB chips, only 1 needed.2 USB 3 ports next to each other - great for that external DVD recorder that you may need from time to time (Most DVDs require 2 USB ports)Sim card slotRubbery like coating on the outside case, minimizes finger prints and makes it easy to grip.Docking station capable180 GB SSD vs. typical 132 GB SSD.Sound, not too badMissingFront Camera - good for recording meetingsWould like to of seen a higher resolution screen10 point touch with pressure sensitivity screen with digitizer stylus for pen inputMy other ultrabook has an i5 processor, but this is so much faster.  Part I belive is the SSD,the other part though is because it's new and not alot of software has been loaded to slow it down.I can't get over how smooth and thin this is.  Although it's long / tall.  Typing on this is not bad, keys have plenty of travel.I've installed MS Office 2013, a pdf converter, picasa, Fujitsu scanner software and a few utilities.  HD space avaliable is around 95 GB out of 144GB.  The extra HD space given helps (180 vs typical 132 GBs).  I still need to load lightroom, camtasia, captivate, proshow producer pdf converter and a few other utilities.I'm on the fence debating if I should upgrade to the 516GB SSD.  I've already ordered 2 8 GB Ram chips to expand the memory to 16GB Ram.  I'll update this with my findings.  I'm also posting pics for reference.The power brick is also nice and small so if you are a road warrior, this is an ideal travel companion.  Only thing missing is the ability to convert to a tablet and having a stylus and touchscreen.  Perhaps the next version.Hope this helps.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Unit for Work", "Author": "iTibTenzinL", "ReviewID": "R18HBDUMDBUER4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this product!

I suspect it's a lemon as I purchased two of the same model at the same time -- one for myself and the other for my business partner.  Hers is fine.  Mine is a disaster.  I purchased both Elitebook 9470m devices in October 2013.  I also purchased an on-site support care pack from HP for each device because, as a partner in a small business, I can't really afford to have significant downtime with my primary work device.  Unfortunately, I've had trouble with this particular HP Elitebook since it first arrived on my doorstep.  It crashed during initial setup, and I had to do a system reset several different times.  A software issue?  Perhaps, but not a good start to the end-user experience.  I've had intermittent problems with most of the Office 2013 programs since October 2013.  They crash or lock up without warning.  I've learned to back-up work frequently, but the hassle factor is still high.  Again, perhaps those are just software problems.  HP support was certainly quick to assign the blame to Windows 7 and Office.  Then, about 10 days ago, the hard drive on my Elitebook 9470 started making a loud clicking noise. The dreaded \"Smartdisk Imminent Failure\" message appeared shortly after that.  I backed up everything, ran a hardware diagnostic, and learned that the drive was indeed failing.  I wrote down all of the error message information and called HP's \"Elite Support\" on Wednesday of last week.  The gentleman who took my call required only about 2 minutes to concur that my notebook's drive was bad, and he told me that a new drive would be shipped, picked up by an HP certified technician and then installed in my notebook on Friday of last week.  Now, that's not the 24 hour turnaround time HP promises, but it was close enough.  Friday came and went, but no technician and no hard drive ever showed up.  We were expecting poor weather in our area, and that was the reason I was given initially when someone representing HP called to tell me that the support visit would be rescheduled for Monday.  I called the HP rep back and asked for an expedited service request.  I explained that I was traveling for business starting on Saturday and would effectively be without a functioning notebook until I returned home the following Wednesday. That's when I learned that the weather was only part of the problem.  The replacement hard drive apparently hadn't been released for pick-up by UPS.  After multiple calls and conversations with several phone support personnel, I learned that all of the people with whom I'd been speaking during this 5 hour block of time weren't even affiliated with HP.  By then, the weather had turned poor, and any chance of a service call had gone out the window. The best solution they could offer was to reschedule the service call for the Wednesday I arrived home.  That was yesterday.  The HP tech did show up, and he brought the new hard drive with him.  Before he installed it, he asked me to give him my backup media.  All I could give him was a blank stare.  \"Back up media?\" I asked.  \"Yes, a DVD or maybe a flashdrive that has a copy of the operating system for this device on it.\"  Just one problem with that: my Elitebook Folio 9470 didn't ship with any back-up media because it doesn't have a DVD drive.  HP's \"Elite Support\" confirmed this when I called them to complain.  \"That particular model doesn't ship with backup media because it doesn't have a DVD drive, and the backup media we'd normally send is on 2 or 3 DVDs.\"  When I asked why I hadn't been told that during my initial support call, HP support couldn't give me an answer.  When I asked how long it would take to get the back-up media, I was told that it would be 3-4 business days unless I wanted to pay for expedited shipping,  When I asked if I was going to have to go purchase an external DVD drive just to reinstall the O/S, HP Support told me, \"Yes, that's what you're going to have to do.\"  There were no other options.  I requested expedited shipping and told the HP Support supervisor that I expected not to be charged for it.  He said he'd take care of it, but when I asked for a tracking number he said he didn't have access to that information at the time.  I asked if there was someone to whom I could speak to register a complaint about this entire, week-long miserable experience, and I was promised that someone from HP's Customer Care group would contact me by noon today to discuss the matter.  It's now 2 pm, and no one has called.  The back-up media?  Not here.  Moral of the story: if you want to be bumped around HP Support and its various subcontractors, spend hours on the phone, wait a week for support that you paid to have provided in 24 hours, and have that support arrive in incomplete pieces, and then wait even longer to resolve the problem with your device, then by all means buy an HP Elitebook Folio 9470m.  And be sure to fork over several hundred dollars more for one of HP's awesome Customer, (we couldn't) Care (less) Packs.  What a great value!  Or, you can do what I'm leaving my office to do right now: Buy a MacBook Pro.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BNRKWMU"}}
