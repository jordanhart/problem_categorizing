{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The Little Sony That almost Could...", "Author": "Mox \"Sunshiner\"", "ReviewID": "R1VI2O937LU5C9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have now owned this little traveler for a week and have seen its worth and its warts. First, and vital to me as a frequent flyer, I adore the size of the Vaio P series. It is so easily carried in a brief case - along with its small power brick. The weight is amazing - so light that it almost makes you wonder what's really in it! So in the travel department the Sony VGN-P530H is a hands down winner.The screen resoultion is fantastic! I never use the zoom since I can easily read the fine resolution print. And in programs like Microsoft Word they all have their own zoom factors so it is not a problem to me. I do a lot of touch typing in the Word format and the keyboard works very well for me - but I do have small hands.The battery life? Well there's the rub. The standard battery in normal usage last me an hour to an hour and a half. I have ordered the extended battery (and a case) from Sony Style.The speed? True the loading is a bit long but once up and running I find the system, while not perky, at least adequate. A bit of tweaking with startup settings and it did improve. Also keeping the Vista sidebar to bare bones or none ar all helps.Overall - I enjoy this little beauty and look forward to many airmiles with it.", "Date": "March 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great netbook, just don't expect it to be a powerhouse laptop", "Author": "Fabio H", "ReviewID": "R2ATYUZHJFW8YW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like the title of my review says, if you're expecting a netbook to play 1080p videos while doing Adobe Photoshop while playing Crysis, then this is not a machine for you.Screen is really sharp and the fonts seem too tiny at first (8\" screen coupled with 1600x768 resolution), but if you adjust your font size dpi to 120dpi or higher, it's very manageable. After a while of using the Vaio, all other notebook screens look so coarse.Portability, excellent keyboard, and excellent screen is the main reason I like this unit.Cons: The Intel Atom Z520 1.33Ghz is slightly underpowered. I have a Acer Aspire One as well running an 1.6GHz Atom, and the 0.33GHz difference is there, even though the Acer has 1GB of memory, and the VaioP has 2GB, the extra memory helps a little, but not much. The Aspire One is definitely speedier.Battery life is ok, since you can get 2 1/2 hours under normal use. The recharge time seems kinda long, but it's ok for me, since it's better to have a battery charge slower vs. faster, so it wears out less.I got the VGN-P530H which is the 60GB PATA HDD model. I played with the 64GB SSD and 128GB SSD models in the store, and frankly I felt as if the SSD models were slower, mostly because SSDs are slower because of write operations. Windows is a OS that swaps to disk a lot when memory is low, so having an SSD is not that beneficial. The $300 price premium over the HDD doesn't seem worth it to me, so go for the HDD version.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "High Priced, Low Performance", "Author": "Mugur F. Tolea \"Better with M\"", "ReviewID": "RMTCDDG7SKF1U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This computer has style. It has everything you need from mobility prospective - especially the Verizon broadband connection that complements the regular Wi-Fi ($45/mo plan required). The screen is sharp and bright, keyboard is ergonomic, fast boot mode is useful. Definitely for someone that is travelling a lot and needs a lite, stylish and connected computer - this is IT.However, there are negative elements that you may consider in your purchase decision:- Microsoft Vista makes it a VERY slow computer, with a lower than average performance index - including regular start-up, launching programs, video sub-optimal (I cannot watch iTunes or YouTube videos in normal conditions);- touch pad and stick are very sensible - I had to disable them and use and external nano USB mouse;- screen size is too small, text is very hard to read;- GPS application is crashing often, the wireless/connectivity dashboard has to  disabled to use the mouse correctly;- Internet Explorer 7 is crashing regularly, I had to use Firefox, Safari or Chrome.- short battery life - about 1 hour with only one wireless connection on (all others and GPS are off);- there are not useful productivity or multimedia applications installed, however there are all kind of obscure things pre-installed that take a lot of space;- Microsoft OneCare is very slow and clunky;- price is high, accessories are expensive, not a good value.Overall, this netbook is not worth the price, better value and performance may be found in Asus eee PC or Acer Aspire One.", "Date": "April 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "VERY SLOW", "Author": "Reno Ross \"Techno Rover\"", "ReviewID": "R22DJICT98SVEY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "PRO: The design is world classCON: Very SLOW. I am surprised that Sony would use Vista operating system for this. Don't they have quality control?

Kim \"HaMa\"", "ReviewID": "RSDQ2ZVMEW9DM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have used few other laptops and desktops. But this was my first try with \"netbook.\" This products has a great features, style, and size and that's one of the reason I bought this netbook.  There are some pros and cons about this and I'll let you know to help you on purchasing this item.pros:1. The Size: size of this product is just amazing. There are few other netbooks came out but this is the smallest. Very handy and portable. I mean who's gonna beat the size of 9.65\" x 4.72\" x 0.78\" and the weight of 1lb 4.8oz?  The only thing is, it's not going to fit on your hip pocket, like it advertised. But It will fit on your hand just fine, or for girls, it will fit on your small purse.2. The resolution:  Most of the netbooks came out with the screen resolution of 1028 x 680, but Sony made this 1600 x 768, which provides more comfortable views for users. Although, the 8 inch screen is kindda too small for that resolution, you might feel tired after looking at the screen for long time.3. The instant booting system:  The instant booting system (based on Linux system) takes about 15 seconds to boot up, you can browse websites, watch movies or listen to musics.  You can also boot up the computer to windows mode from there.  This comes very handy.Cons:1. Sony just had to make it with the Vista.  The performance goes dramatically down running Vista on this product.  You can also downgrade it to XP, which makes VAIO P much faster to perform, but you will find lags watching movies because there's no GMA 500 chip set driver for XP. The best way to use VAIO P is to upgrade its operating system to Windows 7, overall performance was very nice. Although, it might be slower than XP, you can use GMA 500 driver and overall performance is good.2. VAIO P is using 1.33GHz Z520 Intel Atom Processor.  This chip set makes VAIO P not able to perform as fast as other laptops, but for netbooks, it is pretty fast.3. The price of this is about $1,000 when most of netbook's price is around $500. I don't think VAIO P performs twice as much as other netbooks, but the design of it is more than twice as much as other products.4. HD (Hard Disk) performance is much lower than SSD (Solid State Disk) performance. I think it'd be much better to choose SSD model if you want to buy this. Bad about it is the capacity. It only holds 60GB for HD, and 64GB for SSD.Overall, This is a netbook that I personally thought of best. I think this is definitely not for the main computer, but great for sub-computer. It comes very handy and portable, so if you are looking for a sub-computer (or laptop), this is one of the best.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just Crashed!!!", "Author": "U.

Somewhat slow with Vista and 2gig of ram but a lot of good features such as wifi, bluetooth and the screen is just plain awesome. The keyboard is a chiclet style which makes typing a bit easier and the mouse is the pointing stick. I use to like the pointing stick when IBM used them in their Thinkpads so it's no big deal to me. I like this unit much more than any netbook I've owned and I've owned a few. The price is somewhat steep if you pay retail but I bought mine for 435 bucks so I'm not disappointed in the price. For listening to music, watching video, checking email, contact book, writing occasional documents, cruising the in internet with a compact and pretty machine then you  might like this unit.

Vaughn", "ReviewID": "R1XM5JCZWKOE19", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The packaging is beautiful and the size is wonderful. The battery life is simply not good enough to make the product useful to me.Booting the machine is painfully slow. It takes something like 5 minutes for a complete boot. If you want to tinker with registry and stuff maybe this could be reduced a bit.What I want is a PC that acts like a cell phone: you open the cover and it is ready to go. 5 minute boot is not acceptable in that scenario.You can avoid the boot by making the system sleep/hibernate when you close the lid. It takes less that a minute for it to wake up, and I could live with this, except the system consume significant energy when it is asleep. If I close the lid (and put the machine to sleep) on a full battery, it will not make it through the day asleep. If you use it for a half hour, you have reduced the sleep time quite a bit (a couple of hours).I am sure Sony has a list of tips for extending battery life, but I don't want to become a laptop energy expert.My guess is that people who give powerpoint presentations would love this, also people who fly a lot. It would be great for them because it is so small and light and the battery life wouldn't matter because in both these situations you could plug it in.I'm curious if replacing the hard drive with a flash drive would help. Also, maybe a faster hard drive would make the boot quicker. Windows 7 might help. Maybe running Linux would help the boot time too.I've toyed with getting the extended battery, but the thought of spending another $100 after the original $999 is not very attractive. I'm seriously wondering if I can find someone who would trade a Kindel DX for the Sony.", "Date": "October 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Sony P Series", "Author": "Sofie Le", "ReviewID": "RDSHVNZX33SG5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This latop is the most beautiful thing ever.

Yes, it is stylish and lightweight, and easy to carry (fits perfectly into her favorite handbag!).  But every time I use it, I get so frustrated with its slow speed that I want to just toss this thing out the window.  Apparently there is no system malfunction, applications are kept to minimal, and the power-saving mode is set to high performance (at the expense of battery hours), but it is still too slow.  Small notebooks coming out of Taiwan in recent years cost less than 1/2 of this unit, and they are more than twice as fast.  If you are looking to make a fashion statement, then go for this Vaio.

As soon as my notebook arrived I tried out the keypad and it was a perfect fit for my fingers however, the scroller implanted into the keypad is a little bit hard for me to control, I would strongly recommend something easier to command by.Now the software (windows vista) is brilliant, my parents have a mac and the software on there is boring, but with windows vista it is amazing . What i adore about the features on the software is the \"Windows movie maker\" it is awesome I love making home-made little videos of my dogs.  And also the search widget on the start program. It is more easier to look for things than just scrolling down and looking for things.The model is quite cute and is easy to carry however i would suggest maybe a cd slot to watch movies.here are my thoughts and I would strongly suggest you purchase this notebook .thank-youWilliam copland henderson gowans", "Date": "May 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice piece of hardware but vista is SLOW!", "Author": "D.

First of all, it's over priced, you should get at least 120gb hard drive!  Half the space is already gone before it's delivered to your door.  The screen is pretty small, it's really hard to read at times, you can increase the screen size on Windows Explorer but that makes it hard to navigate through the pages. Secondly, I can never use it for an extended amount of time because it freezes. I have to shut it down and reboot !  I haven't loaded anything on it because there isn't room so I'm not taking up any space.  It also crashes and reboots on its own, I'll get some kind of crazy blue screen.  Also, regardless of where I am, when I'm using the internet, it decides to disconnect or give me a limited connectivity messages. Lastly and worst of all, the screen cracked!  Not sure if the dog or one of the kids stepped on it but I opened the screen and it looks cracked with broken pixels.  Called Sony, because I figured it would still be under warranty and was told it's not covered!  Had the same thing happen with my Dell computer and they fixed it with no problem, no questions asked!  Then, these people at Sony had the nerve to tell me that a new screen would cost around $600!!! That's over half of what I paid for this piece of garbage!  Oh well, you live and learn.
