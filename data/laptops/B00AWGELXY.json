AMD did a fine job with this!the sound is better then other laptops i have owned. it has some dolby program settings that really help.750 gig hard drive is plenty! 4 gig ram installed (upgradable to 8 gigs)-  the video uses 512 itself plus more if it needs it-  the dvd drive seems a tad flimsy- but works with no problems! as long as you are not beating on it i think it will last you. for 300-400 bucks i really cant find another laptop that compares- and i searched everywhere!this thing just works!!  windows 8 takes a bit to get use to- but once you mess with it for a little while its fine!i dont use apps so i just uninstalled every app and only log in as local user (dont want microsoft account)then i turn off all the reminders,apps,pop ups----etc  so its like windows 7 (sorta)  then i replace all the app icons (squares) with my own programs. so that start up screen has just what i want there and no apps!!  ok im drifting off here--- this is well worth the $  btw- windows 8 may take you a min to get use to but one thing i have to say, it is a very fast os-stuff opens quick on this laptop!  none of that click n wait!  very zippy --  im gonna order 4 more gigs ram this week and that should even be better :)", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "Breanna", "ReviewID": "R2ZHMYFESUC6MU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was nervous buying a refurbished computer but this is great.

I am a very hardcore gamer see a powerful laptop was necessary. Gamers this computer let me play Warframe, Warhammer dawn of war 2, Torchlight 2, The Stanely Parable, and most likely much more. Windows 8 also works great and had no such problem getting used to the interface. The only problem I had is that the \"fn\" button does not work, for the most part i can live without it.  Webcam works very nice, and the mic is a nice addition as well.
