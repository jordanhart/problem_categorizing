I bought this from best buy, here the price quoted seems ok since I paid around $360 for this. I was looking for 11 inch laptops, tried an ASUS upfront, the 1.5 celeron equipped one, It was non responsive and was very slow in action. This looks pretty good in this price range.I have one concern about the screen brightness and contrast. This looks something strange for me sometimes, since sometimes it brights up itself, sometimes, low light. I use Mac book pro as well, but when I switch to this for personal use, I can see a huge difference in display.May be the power management software is not good, or the default settings for brightness and contrast is not so good.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Cheap Ultrabook for Business Traveler- With a Couple of Notes", "Author": "PA student", "ReviewID": "R3O2Z1U2CCHRN1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First the likes:small, light, great battery life, touchscreen, Windows 8 (yes I do like it)Dislikes:Screen resolution is so so, keyboard is very cheap- had keys canting after less than 3 weeks.If you are like me and a tablet is nice but need a real keyboard, this is nice. If you don't want to drag a full laptop along but like touchscreen this is a little gem at a really cheap price. Its really a tablet with full windows, attached keyboard, and a dynamite processor / package for the money.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It not a good deal for the Price.", "Author": "Mulugeta", "ReviewID": "R3JSXYCWEIWE1X", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product is just Ok.
