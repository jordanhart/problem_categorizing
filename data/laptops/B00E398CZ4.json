Bordas \"A Buyer\"", "ReviewID": "R22SD6XA5OY9A3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The seller is a 5 star seller, but this review is about the product, hence the 3 stars. Also, I wont spend any time talking about windows 8 and YES, you are tied with Windows 8 if you buy this laptop as Windows 7 drivers are hard to find or none existing.I would have giving it 3.5 stars if I could. I'm pretty sure that most of the points I will make also apply to the complete 2013 Envy 17 inch line.On to the review...I've had this laptop for about a month now. This is a fast PC, which was to be expected from a 4th gen i7, 16 gb ram and SSD. I run Photoshop, Illustrator, some games at full specs, etc. and everything works smoothly. Everything else that you would expect works great: wireless, speakers, camera, etc.The design is what truly makes this laptop stand out. You have aluminum monitor cover and aluminum upper body (the bottom of the laptop is plastic though). The touch and feel is great. My wife was a 13 inch MacBook pro retina  which is full aluminum and you can clearly see that HP went after apple with this design. Apple is still a whole league ahead in terms of design, but this is as close as you are going to get on a PC. My other options were Asus, MSI and Alienware and I simply couldn't show up to a meeting with any of those since they look like the controls from an alien spaceship.While all of this is really good, again, it is to be expected from the specs and the price of the laptop. There are 2 minor problems with this laptop and one HUGE problem:1st, the keyboard flexes down on the left side when you type. Even without any pressure, simply pressing a key around where the S key is will \"sink\" the entire area just a little but enough to be really annoying. It also makes you wonder about the durability of the keyboard and the construction quality. You can search on YouTube for a video that another user posted about this problem, which leads me to believe that it is a very common problem. Nonetheless, I consider this to be a minor problem since it doesn't really affect performance.2nd, the track pad buttons are really hard and they just feel awkward to press. For some reason they don't feel natural, specially when you have to hold them down to drag an item. HP wanted to follow mac here and make the buttons integrated with the pad, but unlike a mac, the entire pad is NOT a button, only the lower part, and there is no line or nothing to let you know where the button area is. Again, this just feels unnatural, but I still consider it a minor problem.3rd, the monitor. This is what almost made me return the laptop. While this monitor is 1080p, you can clearly see a tiny gap between pixels. This creates vertical lines which are very noticeable on solid colors like your browser background. My 5 yr old HP that was 1600 x 900 (basically 900p) looks MUCH better than my new 1080p laptop. I read about another user here in Amazon warning about this issue but it never crossed my mind that something this horrible could be kept so quiet. That user called it \"windowed pixel\". I have become used to this problem and it doesn't bothers me as much as it did before, but when you see another monitor you get that \"wow, my laptop monitor is really bad\" feeling, which you shouldn't get from your new computer.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP Envy 17-j029nr Quad Edition Windows 8 Notebook PC; 240GB mSSD, 1TB HD, 16GB RAM...", "Author": "Christina L Ogren", "ReviewID": "R1Z73UFYEN0B14", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am loving my new computer.  It has taken a bit to get used to since my old computer ran Vista.  I debated on touch screen and in retrospect feel that I might have been happier having included that option.  I am, however, very happy with the anti-glare screen.  I want to give a shout-out to the team at Eluktronics who were AMAZING at fielding my many calls/questions.  They were incredibly helpful in discussing any and all options available through Eluktronics, Inc..  I ordered either 1 or 2 day ship somewhat late in the day and the Elutronics team really pulled through!  I have a beautiful HP laptop with which I am exceedingly happy.  I am also happy to highly recommend Eluktronics, Inc.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,999.99", "Features": "Genuine Windows\u00ae 8 64; 4th generation Intel Core i7-4702MQ Processor (2.2GHz, 6MB Cache, 4 Cores)\n240GB mSSD Hard Drive & 1TB 5400RPM Hard Drive; 16GB DDR3L 1600MHz RAM (2 Dimm)\n17.3-inch diagonal Full HD Anti-glare LED-backlit display (1920 x 1080), Blu-ray player and SuperMulti DVD burner; 6 Cell Battery\n2GB NVIDIA(R) GeForce GT 750M Graphics; Intel Wireless-N and Bluetooth\u00ae; 120W AC power adapter\nBacklit Keyboard; Beats Audio with 4 Speakers; Fingerprint Reader; 4 SuperSpeed USB 3.0 Ports; 1 HDMI 4.0 Port; 2 Year HP Warranty", "Name": "HP ENVY 17-j029nr Quad Edition Windows 8 Notebook PC; 240GB mSSD & 16GB RAM Upgrade", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qBbiVJvgL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00E398CZ4"}}
