So my first impression is very favorable.So I'm in the process of getting all the software sorted out, which i guess is fun.Here's my initial pro's/cons:Pro's:1 - This beast barely breaks a sweat - I mean its so quite, the stealth image does do it justice, it's very quite almost silent, when I reran the window index thingy the sound never changed, and doesn't even feel warm.2 - Screen is lovely Matte and very very bright clear and generally amazing, way too intense in a dark room, my old dell xps 1330 which is sitting besides with both at max brightness it looks like a dull yellow compared, it has very good angular visibility too.3 - Keyboard is nice, firm well spaced out, I like the keyboard lights - without it keys actually very hard to see in low light, as the text doesn't contrast at all with the black keys.3 - Touchpad nice size and nice to have multi-touch gestures.4 - Asus software, actually some useful software(and bloatware see Cons) - like fastboot which delays boot items.5 - Backpack (rucksack) good amount of pockets, sturdy and compact, only just fits laptop in fact, but has plenty of space for extra stuff, nice touch Asus.I don't know about performance as not pushed it at all yet, but from the index score its pretty good, I am mainly using it for graphic's work so its more important to be fast processor and memory than graphics, but I am tempted to buy and try some of the latest games cos this beast is designed for them. Btw in case you don't know one downside to this rig is the graphics card has a 128bit memory bus instead of 192, which from what I have read makes a difference, the 17\" has the 192 bit bus. It's no big deal for me and having a usable size for a laptop was more important than Memory bus speed, still would have preferred to have the option for this, recon most gamers will pay the extra and Asus should have made some models with the bigger bus, and given us the choice.Cons:1 - Bloatware - crappy crappy annoying bloatware, such a shame cos in my mind Asus has really got there stuff together, making some seriously decent equipment and marketing and doing everything right, except bowing to the pressure to include crap on their rigs (for a small dime no doubt) - I decided to create a backup disc set and reformat which took hours only to find that the backup disc puts all the crap on again except the drivers which you need, so either way you have to uninstall it all. I ended up taking almost everything off then using the asus utility to load the drivers and useful stuff back on. thing is there are tons of processes running and I hate not knowing whats happening behind the scenes on my rig, I wish I could completely disable/delete most of these processes and services running but I don't know what they all do.2 - included gaming mouse is nice, uninstalled software for it, limited control and adds to the startup.Will update after a while when I learn more.Update 1:Had a problem with the Realtek Lan network drivers, they kept failing to install fully and could not get windows to get the drivers to work or install, spent many hours trying to find the solution online and in their help guides, was thinking either the lan hardware was dead or in some kind of zombie like deep sleep. Eventually got it to work, uninstalled everything Realtek driver and windows device hardware, rebooted then manually installed by handpicking the type of device and the driver -thankfully everything started to work! - I now have lan working and don't have to do a emergency disk reinstall from scratch or send it back.Power4Gear Hybrid seems really buggy, doesn't connect quickly enough with the hardware button, also when I save it to screen timeout it doesn't work and the screen just stayed on, all night! - not a major bug but hope they fix with a update.Also with all the software installed or most of it, my processes list is way too big for me! I like to know what's running and keep my system simple and bare, but this is more about the extra software included, and being unsure what I can uninstall.", "Date": "December 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Built like a stealth fighter jet, and runs like one too!", "Author": "Vard", "ReviewID": "R3UK04DCDWES2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Im gonna cut straight to what you gamers want to hear.This laptop can run skyrim at MAX settings, and ittl get a TEEENY bit choppy in towns.It can run WoW at max settings, without skipping a beat. (poor internet connections may still slow the loading of orgrimmar though)It can run SWTOR at max settings, and same as wow, my slow interet speeds slow the loading of the Republic fleet on a busy day.It can run Tf2 at max settings, even when i use console commands to DOUBLE the gamespeed on offline practice mode.It runs minecraft at full settings without flaw.Im currently installing Just Cause 2 and Portal 2 and Garys mod to test those games, but based on how it handled the first 5, im sure they'll do just fineThe gaming mouse mine came with was a nice freebie, but as a long time user of the Razer Naga, i feel that the button placement for hte included mouse is horrible for gaming.  Two on either side of the primary mouse buttons. and 2 below the scroll wheel.It also comes with a backpack. Ive only used the backpack for 1 day so far, but it seems like a decent backpack.The backpack is dark grey with mild green. (at least the one *I* received is that color, peraps the colors vary)at first i ordered this laptop by mistake  ( i was reviewing the G73sx )  but after researching more,  and seeing in person  how big a 17'3 laptop is, im glad i got this version.The trackpad is OKAY i guess, but when im playing anything but SWTOR or WOW, i use an external mouse.also its easy to disable the trackpad so you dont hit it by accident, you just press Fn+F9the lighted keyboard is very nice, there are also arrows on the WASD keys, and a little jumping dude on the spacebar.The battery life depends what setting u have it on, theres a button on the top left that switches the laptop between 4 modes:1. High Performance2. Quiet office3. Entertainment (Theater)4. Battery saverat first i thought my laptop couldnt game with lots of other stuff open in the background, then i realized i just had it on battery saving mode. So dont get worried when that happens, just make sure u set it to high performance.and as the default background suggests, this laptop has the look and feel of a stealth fighter jet.This is a fantastic laptop.

The G53SX is a great PC! It was delivered early and was exactly what I had ordered, all parts in place and ready to rock and roll! I wanted a good gaming machine for Lord of the Rings Online, and it is just perfect for it! The HD screen is wonderful. It's a somewhat heavier laptop, but I chalk that up to the fact that it is made out of sturdy, quality, materials. Oh, one thing that I should mention is how quiet this laptop is. Compared to my older HP laptop, I barely know I am running anything, even my hi-def game! And it is super-cool, temperature-wise, too! I've had it for about a month or so and am very happy with it!", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I was looking for!", "Author": "J. Bumphrey", "ReviewID": "R1120NJ2SMYH0V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using the computer for just over two weeks now and love it!  When I first purchased a laptop in 2007, my main objective was to get something powerful for online gaming.  At that time I was playing World of Warcraft, and the rig I had purchased harnessed more than enough power to handle it smoothly.  Most people into PC gaming though, are well aware that WoW is not a very graphically intensive game.  So what I ended up with was a laptop that was great for playing games at my desk at home, but not practical at all for any other purpose.  It was too cumbersome, weighed somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 pounds, had a 17 inch screen and a 10\"x3x\"4\" \"Brick\" that was part of the power cord.  So I essentially had a \"mobile computer\", that wasn't really mobile at all which I spent far too much money on and turned out being a lemon after 6 months with horrible customer support.  But I'm not writing this review on that laptop, I'm just trying to give you a little history on what motivated me to buy this particular laptop.  So, back to the original topic at hand...the product review.This time around when I decided to purchase another laptop I decided to go with something smaller, lighter weight and powerful enough to handle today's games without going too far over the top on the hardware.  One of the main problems I've noticed with buying what is regarded as \"today's most powerful computer\" is that the more powerful the rig, the bigger it gets.  This laptop seems to be a perfect balance between the two for me.  The size is right, so the computer is mobile and it has pretty decent graphics power.  The first thing I installed was \"Rift\", which is an MMO similar in gameplay to World of Warcraft but far more graphically demanding.  I'm currently running this game on the highest factory setting without going into custom settings and the game is running beautifully!  The computer design is also quite unique and very appealing.  It also comes with a backpack/carrying case which makes the computer mobile in less than a minute.I would recommend this laptop to anyone who wants a decent machine without spending a fortune on any of the top end models.  My intentions are to try a few different MMOs, trade stocks and take online classes and I'm sure this computer has the power to handle any of those tasks.  This makes my 5th computer/laptop and I'm extremely pleased with it so far!", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Failed After Only One Week", "Author": "PeteL \"avid buyer\"", "ReviewID": "R1O4F13R9IWDKV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Asus G53SX is a powerful machine -- when it is working. Plays all games at \"ultra\" settings without breathing hard and at an attractive price point.However, the video card failed after only one week. Suddenly, the lcd screen remains dark during boot. It is either the screen or video card that is faulty since (fortunately) the video out port works when I plug in an external monitor. This enabled me to recover my files. This problem is apparently a known issue and more common than should be acceptable to any manufacturer. Searching the Web you'll find numerous incidents of this problem with other owners of Asus' Republic of Gaming machines (both G73 and G53 models). In fact there is a You Tube video showing another frustrated owner with this issue.As powerful this machine is and as sweet as it is to use -- when in working condition.  My advice is to avoid this machine until this issue is fixed.  Or take your chances and get frustrated with a machine that costs $1400+/- with a known history of failure. Apparently Asus has an issue with quality control of their notebooks or are ignoring the issue as a cost of doing business.Update:After getting little satisfaction from Asus Support, Amazon stepped in and reaffirmed their commitment to excellent customer service. I am a long time / avid buyer and constantly \"spoiled\" by their adherence to customer satisfaction. The growth and profitability of their business reflects the priority they put on going the extra mile to meeting the customer needs. More companies should learn from their example. It is not surprise that Amazon has such a loyal customer base.Oh - Amazon is sending a replacement. Hopefully, I will have more luck with the reliability of the machine.Update:It has been several months since I received the replacement unit and it has operated flawlessly. Continues to be a great machine with all the power you need to play any game without exhibiting any effort. I have updated the rating to 3 stars, it would have been 5 stars except for the fact that the first unit did was flawed.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome computer for the money", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1CKX4O6DSY9UT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is amazing.

I scoured many reviews and found complaints and issues yet kept an eye out for ASUS laptops due to their lower cost compared to its competition being Alienware, and Sager. I really wanted to get this models bigger 17\" brother but was turned off by the size and weight. I'm not saying that this laptop is much lighter. Its a beast.Complaints so far:Webcam and Mic are not the greatest, but adequate. I have had a few complaints using Teamspeak that I'm muffled. I plan on overlooking this by using my phones Bluetooth headset.The power port is annoying! I wish they would have wired it through the back or at least further back on the side.The Speakers as well can't compare to the competition such as MSI yet I will sometimes switch off with some headphones if I really do need to hear something.Praises:This tank is fast. Though I could upgrade it to the full 16GB ram, I probably wont because its smooth enough for me.Gaming. I am an old school gamer so graphics have never been my top priority, just mandatory. I've play Starcraft 2, Diablo 3 (beta), Terraria, Minecraft, Battlefield 3, Dead Island and Team Fortress 2. And I'm pretty embarrassed to admit. The graphics on this laptop blow my personal computer away (Need to upgrade badly now).The wireless card was a concern by reading some other reviews so I had to test it everywhere to see if I had to upgrade to an Intel card. Working at multiple sights and at home the card performed wonderfully.Two Kensington locks on the back allow for some broad security which is needed where I work.Bonus:The ROG Mouse the laptop came with is great. Though I love my Logitech G500 which stays home. This ROG Mouse will stay will my laptop.The Backpack is pretty decent. The only gripe is on occasion its difficult to close around the beefy laptop, but still possible. It holds all my gear I need and looks pretty guide and disguises the laptop well from curious minds.In all I'm glad I purchased this portable tank and for one whole week of loading stuff on it, its a winner in my book.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad Power Connection", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2NW4OE0NH1DC5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like another reviewer, I've also had started having problems the AC adaptor and the battery.

The metal end of the power adaptor will get extremely hot to the touch as well.  I honestly don't know how long this laptop will last and it really bugs me that I'm expecting this unit to fail after only having it a few months.  It's still under warranty and I will get this fixed, but it is a huge inconvenience to lose my laptop for a couple of weeks (again) for a second repair in the time that I've owned it.

I could hear windows load up through the speakers but couldnt see anything.Apparently on this model they made the cable that attaches the screen to the board about 1mm to short. This comes from a local repair tech who has dealt with this before. Being to short they are subject to extra stress on the pivot point and the connectors. Some even break during shipping straight from the factory, others never break. He said that Asus knows about it but refuses to acknowledge it as a manufacturing defect. He said he has repaired at least 20 of these and they all have come back with the same problem again. Apparently there is a 1.5mm longer cable you can get if you can find it on ebay or something.

This is my second Asus gaming laptop. I bought my first one in 2010. The one I bought in 2010 had several problems. During a 2-year period, the video card fan went bad, a USB port collapsed and shorted out the motherboard, and the display eventually stopped turning on. Fortunately I bought a 2 year extended warranty, so all of those issues were covered. But literally a few weeks after the warranty expired, the video card fan went bad again, and now the fan sounds like a lawn mower and the laptop overheats. 2 years later I bought a second Asus hoping the first one was just a lemon.During the first year of owning my GS53X it has been in for repairs 3 times. The first problem was the display not turning on. The computer would power up, but the display remains black. The second problem, the pin inside the power input port fell out, making it impossible to plug in the power cord. Now just today, the display stopped turning on yet again. I've always had problems with both my Asus laptops with the display not turning on after the computer goes into sleep mode, but after a restart it always starts working again. Now after multiple restarts the display will not turn on.The laptop is a great product...when it works. I have friends with Asus laptops and they have never had these problems, so maybe I have bad luck. It runs great, and has little problems running high-end games.

It was all very neatly boxed up, and the laptop bag and mouse that came with it were pretty nice.The laptop itself was very nice, and most of the pro's that people mentioned were true, (powerful gaming experience, being practically silent, effectivly cooling itself down, etc.) but that didn't last long. Initially when I started it up for the first time I had a odd red pixelated shading effect on my screen for about 10 seconds, but the computer fixed itself and I thought little of it.I ran Skyrim at high settings with a little more than 30 FPS and was stable. So when it came down to gaming it was pretty dang powerful for more recent games.The problem I had was that on the 6th day of owning it, I started it up and let it load up normally, and I noticed that some of the pixels on the Microsoft loading screen were really weird. Then I noticed I had yellow pixel shadings everywhere, and I had no idea what to do. I reset it, and it did nothing, if anything more yellow shading popped up.I called Asus support, and was able to talk to a human. Unfortunately I was not able to fix the problem with me, and one of the first things he recommended was to send it to Asus to be repaired, and that would take roughly 12 business days he said. Why send it there if I had the option to also send it back to amazon in 2 days and get my money back ASAP?Regardless, the conclusion is that it WAS a good computer. Having read the reviews, it seemed like a hit or miss item to get, but we gambled it. It did prove itself to be a powerful computer and was quick to use and had a number of performance options available.

What I mean by unstable is the laptop's video goes blank/black and there is no way to get the screen to turn on without having to do a hard reset or power off.  Even doing so will not guarantee it will work when turned on.

Pressing buttons, moving the mouse or touch pad doesn't do anything.- While the system is on, connecting or disconnecting the power cord causes the screen to go black.  Reversing what I just did does nothing so I have to do a hard shutdown.  Turning the system back on again doesn't guarantee the screen will turn on.- Experienced 1 of 2 things when turning the system on or restarting via Windows:1) The system powers on and just sits there with the screen completely black2) The system powers on and the screen is black but goes all the way thru the Windows login process just fine but the screen is still offWhat I have done to get around it and get the screen to turn on and see the Asus logo show up is open the screen at about 30 degrees, or opening the lid as little as possible so I can still press the Power button.  Once the system powers up and I can see the Asus logo pop up then I know the screen is on and all is well.  Otherwise, at times with the screen/lid opened all the way and turning on the system the screen stays black and I just have to do a hard shutdown and retry again.Until, I can get the system operating normally or possibly replaced with a working unit without these shortcomings I'll have to give this product only 1 star for the potential that it has...I'll update the review if I get a chance at new unit or repaired one.ASUS Republic of Gamers G53SX-DH71 Full HD 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (Black)====================UPDATE 2012-02-16: I am VERY impressed with the level of service from Amazon and its distributor.  Within 24 hours of reporting the original unit being defective I received confirmation of a new unit is being sent and I received it the very next business day! So back to the unit, the performance is superb with the out-of-box configurations and default 12 GB RAM, 750 GB HD, and GeForce GTX 560M 2GB.I was able to play most games (e.g. Starcraft II, WOW, Modern Warfare II, Unreal Tournament, Crysis) without issues at high resolution. On top of that the system is hefty enough to handle running database and web servers while playing the games.  On top of that, I am also have MS Visual Studio open and developing on the side.The built-in webcam and microphone works just fine.  Video playback of 1080i movies were great as well.  Too bad the unit didn't have a blu-ray player.Improvements I would say can be with the audio which is not as loud and the layout of the power plug input.  It tends to get in the way of my mouse movements being on the right side of the unit instead of the left or back of the laptop. I also wonder why they did not opt to go with a magnetic connector similar to the kind found on the MacBooks.  The power cord when plugged into the laptop is also not flush, giving it an illusion that it is not all the way in for a good connection.Overall I am satisfied!  Oh do expect the thing to be quite big if you haven't owned a  laptop that is classified as desktop replacement although it hasn't prevented me from bringing it around to the coffee shops or around the home office.", "Date": "January 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "First one was a dud, second one is great so far", "Author": "L.

We conducted a lot of research on gaming laptops and decided on this one instead of the Alienware one he asked for, because of all the complaints and problems people had with Alienware computers (we laugh about this now).  We received it about 2 weeks before Christmas and turned it on once to install the updates - everything worked great.  The second time we turned it on was Christmas Eve (when we were setting it up for him to find Christmas morning), and the screen was completely black, although the lights on the keyboard worked and we could hear it starting up.  We tried everything over the next few hours, called Asus tech support at 1:00 a.m. and tried everything they suggested, and they finally said send it back.  Needless to say, our son was devastated on Christmas morning.  Amazon was great and shipped a new one right away, which our son received on Dec. 28.  The new one has worked great (so far) and our son loves it.  The backpack case is nice.  The mouse that was included is a gaming mouse, but oddly a different mouse came with the first one than the second one (the first one was better).  This would have been a 5 star review had the first computer worked.  Now I'm worried that it's a matter of time before the second one conks out.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i7 Processor 2.2GHz\n12GB DIMM RAM\n750GB 7200RPM Hard Drive\n16-Inch Screen, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560M\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "ASUS G53SX-DH71 Full HD 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop - Republic of Gamers (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31SGzDt-Z0L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005PAJHU4"}}
