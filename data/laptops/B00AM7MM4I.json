{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good value (w/ Win8 is more bearable with 8.1.1)", "Author": "YourName", "ReviewID": "R3AUMZ5XPGB20A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a college student on a budget, I really needed a computer that would do many tasks on the road without hurting the wallet. I have a prehistoric 7-8 year old Dell Dimension E510 desktop that is super slow. So, I made the decision to buy a laptop under $400 yet still faster than my desktop.I set my eyes on this laptop from a local electronics store. I compared specs, from the size and weight, to the nitty features like the number of USBs. And so, here I have it.Let's start off with the design.The design of this notebook is, well, plastic. However, it isn't cheap plastic. The materials used are actually pretty good for its price point. The notebook is nice and rounded around the corners and the thickness of this notebook is about one inch. Now, most notebooks for this price point would be much thicker...Around 1.3in-1.4in, but Dell managed to squeeze everything in 1 inch. This is pretty darn good considering the tools this notebook provides. On the left side of the computer you have a headphone/microphone jack, 3 USB (2 USB 3.0) (1 USB 2.0), Ethernet, HDMI cable, and a power outlet. On the left side you have the optical drive and one more USB port (2.0). So the total amount of USBs this notebook has is 4. 4 USB ports, 2 of which are 3.0. USB 3.0 is relatively new for the market, and this allows much quicker transfer speeds compared to the 2.0s. However, most computers at this price point do not have USB 3.0s, or if they do, it would only be one or two. But keep in mind that this notebook has 4 USB ports. And at this price point, most if not all computers only have about 2 or 3. The optical drive is also a neat feature. For a 1 inch laptop that has an optical drive is pretty impressive considering the price. Most notebooks that are 1 inch or less usually skip the optical drive. Now, the bad thing about the thinness of this notebook is that it does not have a VGA port. You might need a HDMI to VGA port adapter for that. However, considering VGA's thickness and the thinness of notebooks that are coming out each year, VGA is bound to be obsolete due to the benefits of HDMI.On the interior, the notebook has a LARGE track pad. And this is good especially when it is running on windows 8 (I'll get to that later).Below the track pad, there are two left and right buttons. These buttons feel and sound cheap but that is not to be unexpected. When running, the track pad get quite warm. You really can't fault the computer for this because this is a one inch notebook. Since the ram sticks are essentially below the track pad, prepare yourself to have warm fingers. The keyboard is an island style keyboard that are evenly spaced. The key travel is okay. After writing a 5-6 page essay. It's also got a 10 key number pad. However, I do wish that number lock had a tiny light located on the button like the caps lock does. As I'm typing, I sometimes reach over to the number lock while attempting to backspace. One minor complaint is keyboard flex towards the F8-F10 keys, not a big deal since these keys aren't often used. Also, like other reviewer have mentioned before. This computer has a sharp lip. As you are typing, the sharp lip is somewhat irritating. Doesn't hurt to take out a fine grit sand paper is smooth out that lip.Lastly, the spacing between the keys have a glossy finish. I notice that this attracts dust and requires occasional cleaning.As for the hardware,You get 500gb of storage but only 456gb of that storage is usable (the non-usable storage has to be used for the operating system. It runs on 4gb of ram and although it is sufficient, you may want to upgrade to 6 or 8 gigs of ram as you load more programs. But if you're an average web browser, 4 gigs is good enough. To just give you a idea at idle, it is using about 46% of the computers ram. The computer has one extra slot. Downside is that this computer only supports up to 8 gigs of ram DDR3 PC-12800 (you can't fault Dell for the 8GB of max ram since the processor can only handle 8GB). Upside is that when you throw in that extra ram slot, it will give you extra performance due to the dual channel configuration. After removing all the bloatware and Windows finally settled in after dozens of updates this notebook starts up well under a minute. Considering a startup to be when the computer starts to idle.-by the way, uninstall the additional trial anti-virus. Windows 8 already has Defender and so that antivirus will just eat up your resources, I think it comes with Kaspersky or McAfee-The operating system,Now, I'm coming from Windows XP and 7, to be honest...Windows 8 is actually pretty cool. However, if you're an old geezer who likes the traditional interface, Win 8 probably wouldn't be a great option. Anyway, the big benefit of this laptop that allows you to enjoy Windows 8 without the use of a touch screen is the large track pad. This Dell has a 4 and 1/2 inch track pad and using multi gestures features makes it extremely easy.Of course, you can always disable the Windows 8 start up and have it behave like Windows 7. (Look up Windows 8 RetroUI) Other than that, the OS would definitely benefit with a touch screen but without it the system is still enjoyable.Battery life,On a full charge, I get around three to four hours of regular internet browsing.Now for the thinness of this laptop, this computer has a 4 cell battery vs the 6 cell that are in most laptops. Under intense radio loading such as streaming, it will drop to 2 hours...Maybe 3. Keep in mind; you do not want to torture your batteries. The lithium ion batteries used in modern laptops do not like to be charged and discharged abruptly as this will diminish battery life. But, I'm willing to sacrifice 2 cells for a thinner and lighter laptop than have a big and heavy 6 cell.Screen:15.6 inches, 1366x768 glossy.Screen resolution isn't an issue here since most laptops--especially at this price point, have this type of resolution. The problem I commonly have is the viewing angles. This Dell uses a TNF panel, which is offers a distortion of colors when it isn't at the right angle.As for the glossy finish, well, it sucks. It still amazes me why computer corporations still use a glossy finish. The glossy finish and the bad viewing angles makes it somewhat of an unpleasant experience.The WLED screen is bright but the colors could use more saturation.Webcam:It is equipped with a 1 megapixel camera.After using Skype, the picture quality is pretty good.If I compared it with my other Lenovo G560 which has a 0.3 megapixel camera, the difference is like light and day.ProcessorOkay, so it doesn't have TurboBoost or 4-way processing.I have using an Intel Pentium Processor on a Lenovo notebook on Windows 7 and it's pretty good. It gets through most tasks however you must know your limitations.Considering the computers size, weight, and battery configuration, the processor is clocked at 1.8ghz on dual core. I have previously used a Pentium 4 @ 3GHz (a single core processor) and this laptop is significantly faster considering the dual core. Out of box, it scored a 4.7 on the Windows Experience Index. After everything got settled in with the way I liked it, it dropped to a 4.6. Using my way of testing the processor speed, I calculated Pi (Using SuperPi) to one million digits and it did it in 21 seconds. Not bad considering my Dell Desktop does it in 43 seconds... It handles HD streaming off YouTube without problems however when you stream in 720p you CPU usage hovers around 35-60%. Yet, doesn't give you a lot of room of other tasks.Gaming? Well, not much. Don't expect to play WoW or Crisis. It should handle basic games.This processor is equipped with Intel HD Ivy Bridge graphics. Very similar to Intel HD 2000.I was able to play RuneScape on the highest screen settings (other than full screen) with the use of their client rather than the browser. The CPU usage hovers around 80-90%. Game play was still smooth considering it is a 3D game. However, with 80-90% usage, again, does not leave much room for other tasks.Upgrades:The only upgrades you can do to this laptop is RAM and hard drive. The stock hard drive runs at 5400rpm and although it is pretty quick, a solid state would be pointless because you'd be most likely dissatisfied with SSD's price and storage (until they get cheaper). If 500gb is too little, a 7200 rpm hard drive won't hurt.The computer comes with 4gb of ram. Although this is sufficient for basic tasks, it isn't configured as dual channel. Filling that extra DIMM slot will give you better memory storage as well as graphics performance. So why not do it?The CPU/Processor--unfortunately, cannot be upgraded. This is because it is a Ultra Low Voltage Processor (ULV) that is soldered onto the motherboard. This is a big down side since later down the road, you can't upgrade to a used processor at a significantly low price.It's portable, offers a large track pad, good keys, and is loaded with 4 USBs and an optical drive @ just one inch. Overall, this is a great laptop but I wouldn't consider this to be a everyday user. (I use it as a primary since I'm coming from a prehistoric computers, in fact this computer is twice as fast than my old desktop) The processor is the caveat. If you have the option, go for their higher end \"i Series\" of Intel Core Processors.-UPDATE-I reran the Windows Experience Index (WEI) and it jumped from a 4.6 to a 5.1. I guess Windows obtained a better score after removing bloatware and installing the latest drivers. Additionally, a dual channel RAM configuration will allow a slight bump in graphics performance.So here are the subscores that the WEI came up with:Processor: 5.9Memory (RAM): 7.7 <-- I upgraded to 8gbGraphics: 4.6 to 5.1 <-- Graphics performance increases due to a 8gb dual channel configuration, Base score determined by lowest subscore.Gaming graphics: 6.2Primary hard disk: 5.9The WEI scores are based on a scale of 1.0-9.9-Update 2-This would probably fall under build quality. Earlier today I found a missing screw lying on my desk when plugging the notebook for charging. It turns out that this screw was one of the missing screws that was attached to the bottom of the notebook. I was thinking, \"lucky me, good thing I didn't lose it\". So I screwed it back and, and while I was at it I went ahead and checked the rest of the screws. It turns out that all of the screws were not secured tightly (about 2-3 rotations loose). Although they had blue loctite on them, it was not firmly screwed on. Keep in mind, I did not touch any of these screws other than the RAM slot panels which were already secured. I don't know if it just my computer or an entire batch, but a simple production step like secured screws worries me.I would drop a star off my rating (3 stars), but I'm relatively satisfied with my purchase.-Update 3-Running Windows 8.1! The transition was almost flawless except that there was a program I had to uninstall (w/ a little difficulty).Windows 8.1 makes the non-touch situation seem more enjoyable.Couple of complaints is that the two finger tap stopped functioning even after installing the latest drivers designed specifically for 8.1. Sleep functions seems to be a hit and miss as well. Windows 8 slept fine, but 8.1 won't sleep when the computer idles. While searching around the internet, this seems to be a fault by Microsoft and not Dell.If you can live through those gripes, upgrade to 8.1.-Update 4-Now running Windows 8.1 Update 1 (8.1.1). Microsoft added several features that makes Win8 more barable with a keyboard and mouse. Highly reccomended if you already updated to 8.1, get the Update 1.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Lot of Features for the Money - But NOT a Roadwarrior", "Author": "BigdoginTexas", "ReviewID": "R1R6ZUZX7T6HZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer to use just with my Samsung Smart TV - (because the television internet interface is just so slow in performance) Please keep this in mind when looking at my four star rating and review comments.I will get the \"not so good\" stuff out of the way first.  The \"fit and finish\" of the computer overall is pretty good, not great but not poor.  The keyboard platform piece appears to sit down into the bottom case with a VERY noticeable lip edge that is a bit sharp.  As the wrist rest space when using the keyboard is really large (a plus) the edge is not right on the wrist area and so far has not been a problem; I later just stood the computer on edge with the screen hinged open and used an emery board to smooth the edge.I wish the screen had a indent or latch to use in the middle, the lid closes nice and tight, but without having something to grab onto the inclination is to just use one corner of the lid/screen to open it up, as the spring holding the lid closed is tight and the screen is so large I am sure it would be just a matter of time before the case or screen itself is damaged.  I definitely recommend using a two handed approach when opening up for use.OK, that was all I have found so far that I consider a weakness of the computer.  I purchased this computer to sit on the cabinet with my television so I could use it on the internet, and for Skype.  I do not think I would toss this into a computer bag and cart it around for use as it is not built to take a lot of bumps.I wanted a computer with Bluetooth so I could pair the existing television keyboard with mousepad to it and save the expense of purchasing a wireless set - this computer has this.  I have sense found that paring my phone to the computer when using Skype allows me to send files to the computer and then out to who ever I am online with, or just to move pictures without having to drag out the USB cable and connect them together. Bluetooth use and setup, including paring of devices  with the computer and Windows 8 is a Snap.A note about Windows 8 - it really is meant to be used with a touch screen, this computer does NOT have a touch screen, that is not a fault of the computer but the OS I decided to use.  This may be something you want to consider if you purchase ANY system that uses Windows 8 and does not have a touch screen.The computer has a built in camera and microphone, and I find both are just superb for both close up and distance use, I sit about 12 feet back from where the computer is when using the camera and microphone with Skype and the people I talk to say the picture and audio is very good.The Wi-Fi interface can be controlled from within Windows 8, or from the keyboard, long gone is the switch on side of the computer itself.  The indicator is a soft white light (as are all of the indicators) on the lower left edge of the computer, a plus I think as they are not always shining into your eyes.The power on/off switch is in the upper left corner, it is not backlit (hence it does not shine into your eyes either) but has it's own indicator in the four light cluster in the lower left.The computer has a 500GB hard drive, a step up from the 320GB capacity of others in this class of computer.  The processor is only 1.8Ghz, but this also means you , using less battery and less heat is generated.  I find that using the laptop, actually on my lap, is not uncomfortable from any heat generation.  There is a max memory capacity of 8GB, it comes with 4GB.  If you are planning on power gaming or CAD creation then consider a memory upgrade up front or go with a different computer that supports greater capacity.The graphics engine is built in, and is pretty good, full motion video looks great and so far I have not found any problems in quality.  The built in speakers for sound...well that could be better in my opinion but when I use headphones or external speakers it really shines, and as such I am not taking points of for this.Plenty of USB connectors (three on the left, one on the right) and an HDMI output (left side) - this is the only output for video and is more and more the standard, but if you need some other type of video in or out this would be a limitation.The DVD is read / write, I used it for creating my recovery disks, I could use a USB as well but wanted to test the DVD.  It is what it is, not a lot of frills software comes with the unit, but so far I find no lag or artifacts in using it for sound or video.With all the features this computer has, and being at a price point in the near $400 range it did all I wanted it to do without having to spend several hundred more for the same features and things I would not be using.For a light use, on the desk type of situation I would recommend this - keeping in mind the OS and lack of touch screen.  I am happy with the computer, would buy it again, and with the considerations of use in  mind I would recommend it to others.", "Date": "March 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for its price.", "Author": "Darren", "ReviewID": "R2VL6SS8TJFLCY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I bought this at best buy,paid 329.98 with tax added. It is very thin for a budget laptop. Yes its made out of the same hard crappy plastic all american car interiors had a few years back, yes it doesn't have the fastest processor, and can get  dirty but you have to remember that you're not paying much.With that out the way, its a pretty awesome laptop. Using the blue tooth, I can hook up my phone to the laptop and play music from my phone using the speakers on my laptop, no cables necessary. I can be in another room and start playing music on my laptop. It has two usb 3.0 ports so putting music/videos into my phone is fast. While it doesnt have the most powerful processor it's not slow. Windows8 is made to run smooth on even budget laptop (though it might get sluggish from time to time for the most part its really fast.Using the built in HDMI port I connected the laptop to my 55inch 1080p hd tv and using an app called WIFI Mouse HD, i could use my phone as a mouse and keyboard on a 55in tv. The fan is super quiet as well.The Laptop comes with something called WAVES MAXXAUDIO which is supposed to make movies and games and music sound \"extra sweet\" what it really does is make the sound reach further away but makes the sound sound tinny. Not really that great. Battery isn't bad nor good. The Web Camera is also not good nor bad,Overall, this is the best laptop to buy for the price.

The add stated that the replacement would be running Windows 7, which we are familiar with.  The computer came, absolutely NO user guide at all, nothing in writing, and Windows 8 installed.  We wasted over 8 hours trying to figure out the Windows, Live E-Mail and On-Line Internet chores and get them going.  Even getting the computer to connect to our Wi-Fi network was a major chore.

Then finally the hinges appeared that It will come out if we press hard to close the LCD. Then we reported the problem to Dell and they created report and sent us Dell Depot Box with shipping label and during the entire they were prompt and quick. The Trouble started when the laptop reached the Repair Depot and I got a call that the hinges were not covered under warranty it has been put on hold. I was asked to pay $179.00 to get it repaired then I denied it as I was never informed earlier that hinges are not covered. I was told that my Laptop will be returned unrepaired on 07/17/2013. I didn't get any information on Laptop being shipped till 7/24/2013 and the repair depot status was showing that the Laptop is being repaired after released from hold. I called customer center and they said that it is not getting repaired and it will be send unrepaired. After so many follow-ups they sent back my Laptop which improperly packed and LCD broken by Dell.I have written to Dell Director - Customer care but till no positive response.Let me mention here that same Laptop had issue with Motherboard too which was replaced after 2 months of online troubleshooting.I never expected this unprofessional behavior from Dell that they will break my Laptop when I denied to pay extra being covered in Warranty.One of the Out Of warranty representative staff mentioned me that they can't return the Laptop in same condition in threatening way that If I do not pay $179 for which they said is not covered by warranty they can't return the Laptop in same condition in which sent.So now I have a Broken Laptop (Broken by Dell) which was unrepaired and I am not sure whom to contact for my grievances.At least I would never suggest any one to buy even a small part from Dell.---------------I got several calls and emails from Dell after I raised complaint with BBB about my Laptop broken by Dell Depot and they told that my Laptop LCD, Heat Sink, Hinges, Bracets are broken which needs replacement and they just need $179.00 as Diagonostic charge and they are not charging any thing for Part. Let me tell you that I have repaired my Laptop myself after going through manuals only thing which needed replacement was Laptop Base costing $16.00 which too was broken by Dell repair Depot(They took 12 days to Diagnose or say break my Laptop).So if I would have not have repaired my Laptop myself, I would have ended Paying $179.00 (Instead of $16.00) plus Taxes.

With the additional memory, it is noticeably faster.  For an inexpensive laptop, there is really nothing to dislike.  Sure, the keyboard is basically a high end chicklet style, the screen resolution for gaming is just adequate and it is obviously not built of the highest quality materials.However, for home/school use where gaming is not the main use, it is a very high performing piece of equipment.  Lots of folks downgrade it because of Windows 8 - that isn't Dell's fault folks, Microsoft writes/provides the operating system.  But there are workarounds for W8 - look up Classic Shell and add it to the computer and it will give you a much more familiar look.The built in webcam actually has excellent resolution, the speakers are acceptable but tinny but Skype works perfectly fine on it.

I initially said dell tech support was top notch.  However, I did not expect to be calling them for months and months, and specifically, on both laptops the touch pad is defective.  It intermittently freezes.  I looked online and saw that this was a common problem.  Dell Tech goes through a series of very time consuming steps with the customer, involving updating the drivers, diagnosing the hardware etc and the problem is possibly temporarily fixed, it's hard to know, as it is intermittently malfunctioning to begin with.  However, at the end of the day, or many days, the answer is that depending on the tech you reach the options are to either send the computer back for Dell to re-install windows, which I am told by my IT department at my major university, is completely off-track (pun intended) or to send it back to them for them to replace the touchpad.  While the 2nd option seems fair, it really is not.  First of all, as there are so many inspirons with defective touchpads, odds are very good that the new touchpad will be no better than the original.  Secondly, this is 10 days with your computer away, and all your personal info having had to be backed up and erased and then reinstalled.  Third, by purchasing a mouse which is what I ended up doing, the problem is solved.  However, I should not have had to purchase a mouse, one of the points of a laptop is the touchpad.  I think if Dell has a known issue, such as defective touchpads, they should make life simpler for the customer by owning up to it, and figuring out what is wrong with their touchpads, fixing them, and then do a recall, or at the very least, mail out the new touchpads and allow 3rd party installation to be reimbursed by Dell.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Laptop", "Author": "Bill Morrison", "ReviewID": "RCFDAMG2BEAVN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was able to set easily, new windows is great.

First - delivery of original order placed gets lost, I have to wait for second one to be shipped then notice I'm charged for two even though I have email saying credits were issued. But the reason for three stars is that it works now, after the tech had to practically rebuild it. Almost everything in my Control Panel was some type of \"ware\" if not a virus. For once though, I was glad to NOT see 50 google applications.  So once this is working properly, registers cleaned and do not install anything calling itself Microsoft Register CLeaning Pro because it is not really from Microsoft.  Meanwhile, you will get pop up warnings from the real Microsoft telling you there are registry issues ... and the CLeaning Pro pops open with a Windows type logo. This is a virus.  Many  of this type of \"false pop-up scams or spam\" happen, either claiming it's from Dell or Microsoft at the same time the real Dell or Microsoft is warning you something is not right. McAfee came installed for a 30 day trial, but after I put my own anti-virus and other protection their appeared to be far more than McAfee detected. I bought this NEW, after the horrible mistake of purchasing a refurbished computer  -- which is a whole other story. ANyway this Dell is okay, but slow and doesn't stream well. I don't hear any improvement in sound from Waves Maxx Audio (my old laptop had Beats Audio which produced a far better sound for whatever mode you put it in. Maybe Windows 8 is not for me ... after going through many, many Android devices - I needed a regular laptop and this Dell model sounded right for the price at the time I purchased it (a month ago).  This was a Prime purchase but came directly from Dell - or from Dell to AMazon - and it is not a bad computer for the price - just don't buy it for your main device. Most likely you'll find listening to music and streaming movies are better with devices you may have already. The fact that half the things in my computer after 2 weeks were found to be bad news - is the main reason I only gave it three stars. I'm not one to go randomly from site to site so I cannot understand the extra $100 I had to spend to get this to work properly - also, if it's speed you need - this is not the computer for you. Otherwise it is nice to have around when Android devices prohibit your access to many things.*UPDATE December 15, 2013: A/C adapter is junk. It's the kind that has a heavy transformer thing at an odd length and so heavy, it ends up pulling itself apart if plugged in while in use, which is not that often for me. One good feature this laptop has is its warning when battery is below 20% or if you leave A/C in too long. In other words, it helps you help ITs battery last longer ...I HOPE.  I had a hard time finding a replacement A/C charger/adapter at a decent price, too. I've owned this just over a month now- it required many, many updates and drivers and now the Cap-Lock key does the opposite of what it is there for. This happens right after 30 days .... unbelievable. I've had too many computer mishaps this year so I am satisfied with this thing as it is now but not thrilled. I'm not sure if my wifi/e-printer has a problemor if it's Windows 8 that doesn't allow a compatible update ... in any case that year old printer is now useless in conjunction with this laptop.

This is NOT a gaming computer but it will do for your everyday computer needs. I wish it had a VGA port but I can live without it.

I would suggest doing it right away if you purchase and have this problem because it took some time to back-up music, favorites, pictures, etc. before upgrading the BIOS.  They are up to BIOS A09 now. The phone rep from DELL that assisted was wonderful with helping.  The only other Con I found with this product is that the left and right keyboard selections are a little clicky and noisy and the trim on the edge of the laptop keyboard is a little sharp when you rest your wrists on it but for the price I can deal with it.The performance is good so far and it does take a little adjustment to get used to Windows 8 but there is instruction on the desktop.

For instance, I was typing withoutlooking at the screen, and when I looked up, there were no spaces between the words.2 Hot: I may need to adjust the settings, but the bottom of the laptop is hot to the touchwithout a cooling pad.3 No backlight on keyboard: The keys do not light up at night or when it's dark.4 455 GB not 500 GB as advertised: It's not a deal breaker for me, but only 455 GBof free space instead of 500 GB.5 Opening laptop; BE CAREFUL: A reviewer mentioned this and I should have followed his advice. I opened the laptopwith one hand and the bottom of the laptop roughly hit the table and it almost fell. Please open thelaptop with 2 hands. With one hand, slowly open the top part of it and with the other hand firmlyhold the bottom part down.6 No free games installed: There are no free games installed, but you can download free gamesfrom the Windows 8 store.[...]Pros:1 Cheap! I only paid $300.2 Lightweight and thin3 Durable: I accidentally banged it against the table and nothing bad happened to it. I don't knowif that would be the case if it landed on the floor; but the outer shell seems durable and hard andnot light and flimsy4 Keys are easy to clean: There is a enough space between the keys to easily clean with acotton swab.5 Wireless Bluetooth connection: You can connect bluetooth devices to the laptop. For instance,I wirelessly connected my phone to the laptop, and was able to send pictures, music, and videosfrom my computer to the phone and from my phone to the computer without using a USB cord. Also,you can use your phone like a remote control.  Just click on the song you want to play from yourphone and it will play on your computer, even if your computer is in another room! On the desktopon the right side of the bottom task bar, click on the arrow (next to the flag icon) and selecta round blue icon and then select add devices, then it will locate your device and your good togo.6 Fast and reliable: I have no issue with speed if I have multiple programs open,am downloading music or movies, or watching movies or videos on the computer or webbrowsing. You can do multiple things at once, without a problem. But for gamers, probably not,but for the \"average user\" I'm sure it will  be fine.In short, it's a good laptop for someone who does not need a high speed processor, a state of theart web cam, camera, high resolution screen, or a ton of memory or RAM.", "Date": "September 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Annoying but functional", "Author": "Bridget W", "ReviewID": "R33J33A61S2A0P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This laptop seems like a great buy for the price.

For the price, I could not find anything that could touch it. The compromises Dell made were the right ones. I needed to buy a budget laptop for a limited purpose for the least amount of money, and I zeroed in on this Dell due to features.The highlights:OS - It came with Windows 8 which is an abomination on a non touchscreen device, and just plain sucks on any device. I would not use the word struggle. I don't \"struggle\" with any computer device after having done this since there WERE computer devices to begin with. But, even though I could accomplish what I needed, I hated Win 8, form AND function. I began to dislike the computer because of the OS. But that is a subject for another review. So I put Windows 7 on this laptop. Installation was painless, drivers are all available on Dell website, and the machine purrs happily now, and I do not hate it anymore.Speed - it is fast for any business and everyday task.Sound and multimedia - Dell has gotten it right! The speakers sound awesome for a laptop. There are physical limitations to what you can do with such tiny speakers, and they pushed the current tech to its limit. The sound quality AND the volume are VERY good, again, for a laptop.I can contrast it to another budget laptop (Toshiba) that a family member uses. The Toshiba is a nice laptop, comparable to this Dell in every way, but the speakers are terrible and NOT loud enough to be usable. I would not recommend that Toshiba because of it, the Dell is so much better. I have used very expensive laptops, and the sound from this Dell is on par, if not better. I find that when I play music and don't want to use headphones, I turn to the Dell more often than my tablet.Build quality - fine for the price. This is NOT a beater. It is thin and probably fragile as is anything in this price range. No worse than anything else under $600. The matte textured finish is prone to collecting fingerprints, body oils and dirt, but cleans easily.So that's about it.

Finally, they said they will send a Technician at my home with the parts to fix the Laptop. But I wonder didn't they perform quality control test before they put it on for sell?? Now they might could fix it for now because I have 1 year warranty.  But I'm afraid if another defect shows up, what I'll do then?? This is first time I felt cheated and very very disappointed with an Amazon purchase.", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "2nd problem with a \"NEW\" DELL laptop", "Author": "Dennis Mundy", "ReviewID": "R1L72IRN6O5WUG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This one has an intermittent 'card reader', I bought this ONLY as a backup for the other DELL laptop which I had to return , due to a bad 'hard-drive'.

I was dreading the software these manufactures install.  I don't think HP was actually running genuine Windows.  I was kind of glad it gave up on me.  But,  I'm in the digital media market.  I need to stay online for business.  I'll try the Dell.  I fired up my new Dell notebook.  I'm not having any problems.  It came with a Kindle app for Windows 8.  My Kindle cloud appeared in one click.  No need to download anything from Amazon.  This quality reader took care of everything.  I tried to install my old copy of Windows 8 Pro.  It said the activation key was valid.  Windows wasn't activated.  They said I needed to purchase a new copy, after all.  Trouble!  Not much...  Dell saw to it to have automatic restore points for adding features to Windows enabled.  I was back into the original Windows 8 installation the manufacturer installed.  I would suggest Windows 8 Pro with Media Center.  I'm now running the new copy I bought from Amazon on my Dell notebook.  The Dell Inspiron is probably one of the better computers on the market today!Have some fun!Sincerely,Robert Lee Kumpf", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Weird Laptop", "Author": "MommyOfFourLasVegas", "ReviewID": "R12DCMZG3K2B2M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Mousepad is weird.
