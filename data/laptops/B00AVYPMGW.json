Backlit keyboard is cool but feels a little delicate..not a big deal though. Had issues with the wifi connection dropping randomly but uninstalled the driver and installed newer driver from Acer's website (Please see that if you check the driver already installed it says the driver is up to date. But there is another latest driver on Acer website. So you will need to manually uninstall the current driver and install the newer driver). No more issues with the wifi dropping so far. Got a nice deal from Amazon. The speakers are great. Need to get used to Windows 8. Touchscreen is nice. The battery lasts about 4-4.5 hrs. Laptop is sleek and looks fancy. Touchpad is not upto the mark, but again that's not a deal breaker. Some people complained of fan noise on similar model series, but it was minimal and unnoticeable.

When I first tried it slow would have been to kind of a word. Windows 8 was another issue but that is training more that a problem. I brought up the task manager, ctrl, alt, del and watched the resource meter. Symantec was eating more than 50% of the resources and even more during an update. I removed Symantec and installed Kaspersky instead and it made a huge difference. I installed Classic Start 8, which s free and the computer now works as I hoped it would.

I got my moneys worth. After the upgrade from Acers website, I have had no problems with the wifi connection.Let me start with the Cons, because there are so few:1. The graphics display is not exceptional. But good for most uses.2. All the USB ports are on the left side. It would've been nice if they put one on the right side.3. The LAN connection requires a provided adapter. It might be a hassle carrying it around.That is all I have for the issues.Pros:1. Fast for normal use. i5 is sufficient for most everyday purposes.2. keyboard is nice - and the backlight is good.3. Touchscreen works well. I have had no problems with it so far - and windows 8, though with its own problems, is not as bad as a lot of the reviews say.4. comes with 4GB ram in 1 of 4 slots. I am going to purchase another 4 GB to make sure I don't get slowed down with the number of applications I have running.5. Quite light. The battery is tiny.There may be more things I like about this machine - the best thing is the price - around $550.For that price, this machine is a steal. I have a few other Acer machines, and they are all working fine. Good job on this one Acer!!", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Strong laptop for price. Great bang for buck.", "Author": "Nick Z", "ReviewID": "R1F5JO3OSGB758", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Where do I start...  -CPU- The dual-core i5-3337U is clocked at 1.8GHz (which is a little low, but ok for laptops.), which is normally nothing to brag about. BUT it overclocks itself to an insane 2.6GHz when needed. On top of it, the dual-core is hyperthreaded. This means the processor has 2 threads per core, which means it has double the multitasking power of an equivalent Pentium or AMD.  -Graphics/Gaming- As a hardcore desktop-gaming fan, I was skeptical what this could do. I was a little surprised though. The HD Graphics 4000 won't move heaven and earth, heck it won't even feel speedy, but it runs all 2D gaming wonderfully. However, 3D gaming is where you have to compromise. Most top-tier games past 2011 won't run well (25fps or so at 1024x576 resolution across a plethora of titles). However, some games pre-2010 can run pretty well. I was able to get a solid 35FPS on Counter-Strike:Source with all graphics on high (except AA) and at full resolution. Minecraft blew me away, with 30-50FPS on Far render distance and all graphics up all the way (you will drop to 10-20FPS on some of the big-friggin' servers with same graphics, beware. Lower your setting and you'll be fine). I believe the i5 is what really helps this guy during gaming, the 2.6GHz really makes the GPU the bottleneck.  -RAM- Mine came with a 4GB stick running at a nice 1600MHz. Surprisingly, this laptop has FOUR SODIMM slots for RAM. FOUR. So if you really wanted to, you could put in up to 16GB of RAM. 8GB is all you need, though. You can easily oipen the RAM back panel and place in 3 more sticks.  -HDD- The hard drive is your everyday typical 5400rpm 500GB drive. Not super fast, but stays very quiet, almost inaudible. The speed ain't crazy amazing (at least 10+MB/s when copying locally), but then again your buying a $550 laptop. You can only really hear it if you put your ear to the chassis of the laptop. I am not sure if you can replace the drive by yourself, but I'm sure any laptop repair place can put one in for you.  -Audibility- This laptop is quiet. The hard drive is practically silent, and the fan can only become distracting when the laptop is under heavy load (aka gaming)  -Keyboard-  The keyboard is nice enough for a laptop. It's solid and the keys feel secure. However, it isn't exactly a pleasure to type on it like a Lenovo, but it isn't bad either. It's just kinda... normal.  -Display- The 1378x768 touchscreen is very nice for a laptop. At times is almost feels like I'm working on a tablet. The 14\" display is the great size; not tiny but things are not blurry for the resolution. It can get nice and bright during day (on max setting) but is a little too bright during night on lowest setting.  -I/O- It has 2 USB 2.0 and only 1 USB 3.0, along with an HDMI, Display port, and ships with an external Display port-to-Ethernet and VGA converter. The optical drive is well... an optical drive. You can't really go more in depth than there.  -Battery- I can barely squeeze a solid 3.5-4 hours of life with general browsing and some mild battery saving-management. I get around 1.25 hours when gaming off-charger.*EDIT*- With gaming, you can squeeze more around 1.5-1.75 hours out of the battery.  -Chassis- This is a bit subjective, but the plastic chassis feels pretty solid and sleek. It's light and portable.Over all, this laptop is a steal for the price.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Can't be beat at a $500 price point.

Windows 8 and a touchscreen laptop have been a bit of a learning curve for me, but I'm getting along fine.  I would recommend it.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice notebook, not an excellent one", "Author": "P. R. B. Barbosa \"ECGAR\"", "ReviewID": "R2IG0WC1R6QUMO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Peace and blessings!.I had made some research before purchasing this notebook. My previous notebook was a HP 1030-US 14\".The reasons that made me choose this one have been:Acer brand,Costumers rating and reviews,Core i5,14 inches touchscreen,Lightweight;Backlit keyboard;Bluetooth 4.0 and USB 3.0, andPrice;After working around with it for about two weeks, I can share the following:Pros:Looks sleek,Third generation Core i5 is Ok.The fan is very silent,It has not warmed the downside cover at all, and I can use on my lap,Touchscreen is responsive and accurate, and the screen seems always clean after use. Therefore, it is not a strong finger print magnet. Point to Acer.Windows 8 is tricky and I had to familiarize with it. After some training, Windows 8 turned out to be interesting.Keyboard is backlit and lights on as I type any key, and lights off when not in use. It has also a command to turn lights off permanently. This is a good facility and allows me to spare battery.The track pad is sensitive, and has a command to enable and disable it.The notebook has a light DVD player and recorder, although I seldom use it.It comes with Office 365 and Mcafee anti-virus pre-installed (trial versions).Cons:During regular use, which means, Wifi on, screen brightness in the lowest setting, surfing the web, downloading files, battery life will NOT last for more than three hours! Once I disabled Wifi and set it to plane mode, turned off keyboard lights, dimmed screen to lowest possible brightness, also disable a sort of memory boot setting (You can look for informations about this setting in the manual), and just used for tying on MS Word, the battery dropped from 75% to 20% in three hours. Therefore, I estimate it may last up to five, maybe six, hours if fully charged, and in the same restrictive conditions of use as the later above.The keyboard is not very comfortable, as compared to other brands. Often, I have to type twice the same key to have the letter or space typed, as I write this review, for instance. Sometimes, I hit once and it types twice the same letter as, for instance, when I type the letter `a`. This is annoying!The track pad is slightly displaced to the left of the center of the keyboard. This positioning makes me often find the right border of the track pad instead of its center, which makes Windows 8 menu to appear. Again, this is quite annoying.Although fast, USB 3.0 is not as fast as the one in my previous notebook.Original boot up time had been longer when compared to other brands, like ASUS. From pressing the on button, it had taken up to 30 sec to get to the password screen. It had also taken about the same time to complete shut down. Because of that, I decided to increase RAM to eight gigabytes and replace hard disk with a SSD Sandisk Ultra 256. Hard disk replacement was very tricky, and required much attention, but I could do it successfully. To do so, I watched a tutorial in Youtube on how to tear down ACER, which was very instructive. Now, the notebook boots in less 10 sec, and shuts down in about 15 sec.Overall, I gave it four stars.I shall update this revision in a near future.Update: Feb 22nd, 2014I have noticed that the keys of the keyboard are somewhat loose on their places, which may be responsible for the lack of sensitivity when typing. Also, only when I press the center of the space bar, not its corners, is a space inserted in a document.Update: March 7th, 2014The keyboard seems to be much more flawed than I thought at first.The keys seem to be loose on the keyboard. I cannot always print a character on the first keystroke. I often have to type a key more than once for the character to be printed. And at other moments, for a reason unknown to me, when typing once the character is printed twice. This is the most uncomfortable aspect of this computer so far. I am not sure whether this an incident problem on this particular machine I have purchased (lucky me) or a problem also shared by other costumers. I would appreciate if Acer technical assistance could help in fixing this keyboard issue.

I spent a good month of solid researching to find what I needed and this laptop fit the bill.I had financial constraints and hoped to keep the cost ~500, but I was willing to spend a little more knowing this would be an investment- meaning I would own this laptop for years to come. I previously owned a netbook, but obviously that didn't have the kind of processing power that I would need. Then before that, my laptop was a 10 pounder from 2005. I love that this laptop has the Intel Core i5 processor, and the opportunity to expand the memory. I plan to expand later to help with speed, but I don't find any issues with speed as of now.Portability was also key for me because I need to lug my laptop around for clinicals and class day to day. I could easily get a cheaper laptop that would weigh more or less depending on specs, but with all the features (i5 processor, optical drive, touchscreen, 14') this laptop definitely offers most bang for the buck. This laptop is pretty thin and lightweight (<5lbs) and definitely not bulky. I've already had a few classmates who purchased new laptops for the program ask me about my laptop because it looks so sleek and light in comparison to theirs which fit the same specs as required by the program.Finally, I wanted touchscreen because I've heard it works best when using Windows 8, especially for the first time. I figured the touchscreen would give me a leg up in learning the new operating system and perhaps save me time. It's awesome!Great buy, great specs. I love this laptop! No issues thus far....EXCEPT when touching the screen in a text box area the \"onscreen keyboard\" pops up....THAT is annoying. I don't think that's a laptop issue so much as a Windows8 issue, but I could be wrong. I would prefer to disable the onscreen keyboard since I never use it...but I haven't quite figured out how to do that. It's not like you can detach the screen and turn it into a tablet...so I'm not sure why it pops up.

We had purchased one previously that I could not see the keys on the keyboard and Amazon was nice enough to let me return it and purchase this one. It is so much easier to see the backlit keyboard with the added ability of upgrading the ram, which I will be doing shortly, as I seem to be pushing it to max too often. I got rid of the bloatware of which there is way too much of on this thing and the reason I did remove a star. Windows 8 is okay, but I find myself working mostly in desktop mode and installed a Windows 7 menu for ease of use. Windows 8 apps are not intuitive for closing and moving around. They are a bit of a pain in the patuty actually! So it's there, but I just don't much use it and can see the reason for so many of the complaints. But that is not the fault of this computer, which runs great. The screen contrast isn't very good compared to my other computers and can find no way to adjust that. It looks a little washed out, but I can live with it. I have dove into my settings and can find none that would change that any better. Yes, I am at max resolution and adjusted brightness.

For the money (sale) it is great.  It has bluetooth, HDMI, USB 3 and more.  While there are more powerful computers on the market this does what it needs to do.

Compare this V5-471P-6498 to similar  models from other brands and the pricing is an incredible bargain. Even more remarkable considering 14\" laptops are highest in demand, often carrying a steeper price than the larger units that have a larger screen and additional components such as a separate number pad.This laptop has the latest 3G components from Intel, is the perfect size mobile and is fully equipped for all-around use by students and for keeping in contact using all the conveniences a multimedia provisioned laptop has to offer. I don't have a single complaint about mine, and am even considering purchasing a second laptop from where I purchased this one -- TigerDirect. As to whether having a backlit keyboard, well that is just a myth. Always check the specs at Acer before purchase, and they listed everything I received with this laptop.", "Date": "May 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "v good", "Author": "adam shareef", "ReviewID": "R1VSKFSF1M7SKO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "v good easy to use and i love it & i need to buy amzon product i m looking for it?", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5-3337U 1.8 GHz (3 MB Cache)\n4 GB DDR3 RAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n14-Inch Touch Screen, Intel HD Graphics 4000\nWindows 8, 5-hour battery life", "Name": "Acer Aspire V5-471P-6498 14-Inch Touchscreen Laptop (Silky Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41qaIHK75hL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AVYPMGW"}}
