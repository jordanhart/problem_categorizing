At first I was happy with the performance. As time went on, I became very frustrated with it.The first problem is the fact that the power cord fails. I have had to trade my power cord in 4 times in the last year because it has failed. My colleagues have had to do the same. If I had to pay for the power cord myself, I would have spent a lot of money. This is very frustrating.The other flaw is the video. I am not sure if this is the driver or the hardware, but I find myself constantly moving the screen back and forth (open to close) in order to see the screen. What happens is that the screen will occasionally have lines through it that impedes the view. I can't see anything. Sometimes it comes back, but on other occasions, I have to reboot.On a positive note, I like the feel of the keyboard. It feels very sturdy.I hope this helps.", "Date": "September 7, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "It sets a new standard for on-the-move productivity with industry-leading
