The video card (Nvidia GTX 660, 2GB) is better than the one in the 15\" Macbook Pro w/Retina (Nvidia GT 650, 1GB) -- shame on you Apple -- and the processor is also amazing.  The screen is also nice, but as other have pointed out, it's nothing special.  Mine came with a dead pixel, which I was pretty upset about, but it eventually went away with the use of free software.I am able to edit videos without  any problem using Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5 and editing photos is also a breeze.  Using Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and other programs for creating and publishing content also works very well.  [UPDATE: I'm now using Adobe Creative Cloud and all apps work without any issues.] Frankly, this is a better buy over any Macbook.The design isn't something I was too excited about when looking at the pictures but in person it's actually not that bad.  I prefer the sleek look of the Macbook Pros, but the price tag and increased performance this laptop gives me is worth more than its looks.Upgradeability is an important factor in this laptop.  You can upgrade it from 8GB RAM to 16GB which I plan on doing, as well as adding a mSSD for caching purposes (for even faster performance) and, potentially, replacing the CD/DVD drive with a HDD bay. We'll see.Bottom line:Get this laptop if you want a large but powerful gaming/video editing laptop.  Not for people who want ultra portability and long battery life.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice Laptop", "Author": "K. Finlay", "ReviewID": "R56JCZTAC9ZPL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Has the mSATA slot, Full HD 1920X1080p screen and a WD Black 7200rpm HDD. When I was looking at buying a laptop I read a lot of reviews about this and other similar laptops. I couldn't find a definite answer whether this particular model had the mSATA or not. It does.  The procedure to migrate is pretty simple. This comes with the MSI BurnRecovery software which makes recovery DVD's that restores your HDD image. I needed 5 DVD-R's to do this.  After I made those I removed the stock HDD (Western Digital Black 7200rpm) and installed a Mushkin Enhanced Atlas Series MKNSSDAT120GB-DX mSATA 120GB SATA III MLC Internal Solid State Drive (SSD) drive.  Need to find a screw to secure the mSATA because the drive does not come with one and you cannot install without it.  It's the same screw that would secure a mini card like a wireless card, modem or Bluetooth. Important!-Get into the bios by pressing Del when the MSI logo pops up and disable the secure boot option in the Bios. Booted from the recovery DVD's and restored the image to the mSATA drive. This puts 5 partitions onto that drive-EFI boot sector, Windows recovery, OS partition, Data partition and Recovery partition. Opened computer management after reboot and removed the data partition.  I also removed the recovery partition which is about 17 GB because I have the backup DVD's. Extend the OS partition to the unallocated space. This gives you about 100GB for your OS.  Get back into the Bios and enable the secure boot option again and boot into your OS. Shut down, reinstall the HDD and reboot. Go to Settings, Change PC Settings, General and select Advanced Startup. When it restarts get to the command prompt. Type in \"DISKPART\", enter, \"list disk\", enter.  Find the disk that is 698GB (should be disk 0) then type in \"select disk 0\", enter, \"clean\", enter, \"Y\" because yes you are sure you want to wipe the drive.  Reboot, get into computer management, activate disk and make the partitions you want.  I moved all of the library file folders to the single \"Data\" partition I made on that drive. Music, Videos, Documents and Downloads.  Installed 'most' programs on the OS drive and still have about 20GB left.  Takes seconds to boot now with no stability issues at all.A lot of reviews say this laptop is a little flimsy or fragile and does not seem durable.  If you live your life with a broken screen on your cell phone I would not recommend this laptop for you.  It is, however, thin and light which is why I chose this particular one.  Take care of your stuff and it will last!  If not, buy the extended warranty.  You cannot set up the mSATA as a Cache drive on this laptop due to the Bios not being able to create a RAID array so a 32GB or 64GB mSATA purchase will result in nothing but hate and discontent because you will only get 32 or 64GB of additional storage out of it.  Or, a compacted Windows install with the need to buy aftermarket file management software to store system and program files on the Data drive.  If you do this and have to wait for the transfer rate of the spin drive what is point of going to mSATA in the first place?I've had this for about a month now and love it.  When I bought this I also bought the mSATA drive and 16GB of ram (this is manufacturers limit)  G.SKILL 16GB (2 x 8G) 204-Pin DDR3 SO-DIMM DDR3 1600 (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory Model F3-1600C10D-16GSQ the entire process to do the upgrades took me about two weeks because there isn't much info on migrating the OS without an OEM Windows install disk or some software that doesn't work because of the EFI partitions.  I refused to buy another OS when the laptop I just bought has one.  There is very little bloatware on this laptop, MS Office setup, MSI BurnRecovery, Battery Calibration and SuperCharger.  That's about it.  No additional toolbars or ads as you would get with other manufacturers.  If you duplicate my procedure the process should take you no more than an hour or two unless you have already put your own stuff on the laptop.  In that case you just have to back up your files and then put them back on when you wipe the drive. If you don't want to wipe the drive you can just delete the OS partition but then you end up with dynamic instead of a basic partition because when you extend your Data partition you extend it to the left instead of the right. One last item-performance and graphics.  I use this to play WoW and I have the graphics set to Ultra settings.

Not only that, windows update didn't work, system tools didn't work and it was 10-15 minutes to reboot or shut down.After a few fits of rage about windows 8, the poor decisions of MSI engineers and a little soul-searching, I relented and actually began trying to solve the problem.  A few hours of research later and I found the needle in the haystack thread that had my solution.For those struggling with the GE70 or other similar MSI laptops, the holy grail can be found here: [...]The thread also contains a number of other things you can try to correct performance problems or other issues with the Windows 8 preinstallation image.  A key command to try in the command prompt is \"sfc /scannow\" without the quotes.Three days and sleepless nights later, the laptop is now running \"as it should,\" for a machine with its resume.  Booting in just a few seconds, running games like the Witcher 2 at just about max settings, handling multi-tasking taboos like installing and running a game simultaneously, with ease.I'm cautiously optimistic that this is going to be an awesome laptop that will last me several years, as I originally intended.Had the laptop come out of the box as it is running now, this review would have been five stars all the way.  I chose four stars even though it should have been three, because it is still awesome despite of all the heartburn and the fact that some users may not be able to figure out the problems with the machine.UPDATE:  Six months later, it's still kicking butt and taking names, and has been able to handle just about everything I can throw at it in max resolution.

So far I'm very pleased with the overall performance and the screen is great (good color and viewing angles).  It does indeed play Diablo 3 and it does it quite easily.  I haven't played other games to give other bench marks but with Diablo 3 I could unplug it from the wall, turn on power saving mode (drops down CPU and GPU quite a bit) and it still played through it smoothly.The first thing I don't like about this is that it gets hot and loud.  Under stress the bottom definitely gets hot and the air coming out of the vent is very hot.  The fan cranks up and is extremely loud and makes it undesirable to play on. This is the main reason I experimented with turning on the power saver mode while playing, the game played just about as well without all the noise and heat (well with much less at least). I'm sure this is common problem for gaming laptops but the design only has one small vent on the left side of the laptop, perhaps if the design had more venting they could have reduced the noise at least.The second thing I don't like is the keyboard layout.  They have moved the function key to where the windows key normally is ( and moved the windows key over near the right shift ctrl key) and also for unknown reasons have also put some of the keys (the ones used in combination with the Fn key) over to the far right side of the keyboard.  One of the main ones I use is the volume function combos, these are all the way over on the number pad/arrows which means two hands on the keyboard to turn up or down the volume and they aren't easy to hit without looking at the keyboard. Generally having one hand on the mouse and one on the keyboard it makes it tough to adjust the volume on the fly (maybe I'm the only one that does this). For me this has been a big annoyance since first getting the computer and I'm still not used to it, the volume thing is annoying and also I'm finding it hard to get used to the windows key switch (I use a fair amount of windows key + other key combos).Overall the computer does what it should which is give a good gaming experience on a laptop.  The heat and noise issues are likely common among gaming laptops, even if this one might be a bit worse off than others due to vent design.  The keyboard issue may be something that only bugs some people so its not a deal breaker but key layout is now something I will more closely consider in the future.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "The thumbs up from an avid online gamer!", "Author": "Oats", "ReviewID": "R2VY4P3ZVJ90GB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son bought this.

The one major problem with Windows 8 and this machine is that the clock will not stay set properly (Windows 8 bug when running multiple hardware configurations).The mouse seems to be a tad bit more responsive than what I am used to which makes it harder to use (however, I use a Logitech cordless mouse with supposed two year life and a very small receiver that works very well). Other than that, it is a great machine. It runs every game I throw at it including Diablo 3 very well with minimal load time.The only downside is that I bought this machine to be able to use in class and to game with. This is absolutely impossible because of the low battery life. Its a powerful machine and it puts a major usage on the battery, but even without the graphics card turned on the battery only lasts for 2.5 hours. So, if you are looking for a gaming machine that is highly portable and well built then this is it, but be prepared to plug it in more than you unplug it and do not desire to take it to school with you.
