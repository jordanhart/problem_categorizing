After about 6 months of just checking out different laptops, I was looking at the Sony Vaio CR series and did like it, but I also was looking at Toshiba. After collecting my graduation money, I started scanning the weekly ads for deals on laptops and found this one for only $500! The Vaio was going for $1100, so it was a no brainer which one I was going to get. I've been using it for close to three weeks now, and the only thing I have notice about the laptop is that the \"O\" key occasionally won't strike while you're typing, but pushing a little harder will fix the problem for a good while. Also, the \"Onyx Blue Metallic\" top does collect finger prints and smudges, but it's not really that bad.I've had my laptop for nearly a month. I got it through Best Buy because of the customer service (and Amazon's lack thereof when it comes to their laptops)Toshiba is a great brand and if I ever need to replace this laptop, I will definitely buy from them again.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "April Mendoza", "ReviewID": "R1A9WP6DPZ4L9L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had A215 for a little over a year now, and it has definitely been a great laptop. I upgraded the to 4 Gb and put Windows 7 on it, and I couldn't been happier. It runs very fast, and I have never had to restore it. My only issue with it is that it gets way too hot. I have had other Toshibas and HP laptops that never got this hot. This one will turn off if it gets too hot and does several times a day, so you definitely need a laptop fan for this computer. Other than that, I totally recommend it.", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great All Around Laptop For Any User", "Author": "M.

The processor is quick - usually running several programs without any slowing at all. Movie playback is great - either watching from a dvd or streaming from the net.

This was my very first laptop, and it really isn't anything special. I always disliked how it didn't have a web cam and it wasn't all that great. This computer gets heated up VERY easily. The temperature will be super hot at most times, and the fan is always on, which can be annoying. The hard drive is very low, at 160 GB. I've had it for almost three years and I only have about 60 GB left. Which is decent I guess, because I'm the only one who uses it. My favorite part about this laptop is the keyboard. It's very easy to type on here, and the mouse pad works great. It also has a nicely sized screen at 15.6\" and the quality is standard. The screen could definitely be brighter, but its just fine. My model is older, so it doesnt have Windows 7, like I desire. All together this is a very simple computer, perfect for a younger age group and beginners.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "problem with fan", "Author": "A.

I USED to love toshiba A215 too, i have this laptop for 2 years. However, i've been taking this laptop for a while at toshiba's computer techs. My laptop kept on shutting down out of no where, especially when I am doing my homework. It pisses me off because there were times that it doesn't shut down on my but it shuts down whenever I do an important homework. I can't even turn it on right away. The computer tech that went wasn't helpful at all. Toshiba's customer feedback wasn't helpful for me as well. However, if I turn on the electric fan and face it toward my laptop, at least it lasts longer. It's not convenient for me though. there are times I want to bring it at school I couldn't because of this issue.I have already made system restore twice as well. It didn't help but only gave me head aches. Then there are weird stuff that suddenly pops out on my screen when I turn it on like \"may application. restore and cancel.\" I click restore and nothing happens? Like what is that?Also, my mouse pad on the center, out of nowhere too, it tells me that it stopped working. I just wonder why it tells me that. I didn't do anything it just stopped right away. Weird.the good things though, I really love this product when I saw first saw this. I am jealous of you guys who just bought it last year and had such a good feedback about it. I love the softwares, the speakers, the screen, looks of it, how it works except for the problems i've been having. But, if i didn't have those problems. I will recommend this product.The company might have made a new good ones though.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "The Toshiba A-215 has been great (for over a year now)", "Author": "D. Snow", "ReviewID": "R2UKGSK2PN6PM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my Toshiba a-215-s5837 now for a year and a few months. I've never had any problems with it. Even running Vista, which most of my friends seem to hate. I use the laptop for work about 9 hours a day and it still works almost as well as new. Wireless seems to have good range compared to my older wireless cards. The Video playback far exceeds the video playback on my 2.8 ghz P4 Dell desktop. The only thing I don't like about it, is that the glare is pretty bad if you try to use it outdoors or in a car. But, the same can be said for 99% of the rest of the laptops out there, so it's a minor complaint. I used to do PC support for a living, and this is the most reliable computer (laptop or desktop) that I have ever owned. In all likelihood, my next laptop will be a Toshiba.", "Date": "January 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "very happy so far.", "Author": "Jack Daniels", "ReviewID": "R3S7F7DBSQ49MV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been a great product.  I bought it a little over  4 months ago from Best Buy - $475... unreal.  Anyway, the twincore amd cpu is really nice to use, I can floor the cpu with one process, and it never seems to actually slow it down. Keep a rendering program active, and go checking email... works well.I didn't use Vista at all, rather I immediately upgraded to Linux Mint.  For those of you considering this laptop and linux, know that the wireless driver is not yet available for this machine.  It's so close, but it's been that way about 3 weeks now...  Anyway, all the other drivers work fine.  great machine.Somebody mentioned that they had a mouse jumping issue with it; they were using Vista, I'm glad to see that, because mine does it too.  However, since this is linux, I thought it was an incompatibility.  I've recently found that keeping my thumbs further away - not resting on the space bar really helps me -- seems the touchpad is pretty sensitive, so... keeping away from it is a good idea.  It's also very tap-sensitive, I've been inadvertently clicking on stuff.  Of course that's all controllable too.I don't use wireless that much, though I'll admit I'd be very pleased if it worked!  My laptop is a dekstop replacement as it's almost as powerful as my desktop.  The only area of concern is the single 5400 rpm drive.  It's as slow as any 5400 rpm drive. the actual drive is: TOSHIBA MK1637GSX.well that's my review.

I bought this for my younger sister when the price was $179.00 and it was in  great condition! It's big, and so worth the purchase. There has been no problems this far. There was a mixup with my order but the seller acted promptly and professionally when I contacted him despite me being a bit hot-headed at the time. He sent the laptop but forgot the charger and had to ship it behind (but it arrived first). I was put through the ringer when it was time to collect my items because there was no invoice for the charger and I had to pay for both items separately because the were shipped seperately. Was not looking to pay $60 + just to collect a laptop but I was just glad it was here. When they told me they only had a charger for me and did not see anything about a laptop my heart sank because I thought I had gotten scammed! But everything worked out.

I've contacted TOSHIBA service department for two issues and they have not been able to fix either one. Their standard answer is to \"do a system recovery.\" One problem is that the cursor jumps all over the screen and starts to insert letters where ever it pleases while typing. The patch driver they gave me was older than the one that came on the machine and did not work. Another problem is with Internet Explorer. It's constantly shuting down and doing an automatic restart for no apparent reason. Even though the software was OEM, they insisted that Microsoft was responsible, even though it clearly states in their warranty that TOSHIBA is responsible for all software that is factory installed. In short, TOSHIBA's service is worthless, unless all you want to do is a system recovery and lose everything you have on the PC.
