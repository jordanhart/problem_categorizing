{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Chromebook the Third", "Author": "A. Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R3S69VAKMRUEVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Acer's C720p is our third Chromebook (large family) and it follows Samsung's, purchased a little over one year ago and HP's Chromebook 11 a couple of months ago. We are very happy with all three and we're likely to purchase more so, let me start by answering the obvious question (see next paragraph).WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3\u02d5 4\u02d5 5 times as much should do better most of the time.\u02d5 If counting 'hours' and excluding 'work hours', Chromebooks are our most used computers and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.\u02d5 Malware, spyware, adware\u02d5 free. Since nothing is manually 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now actually turning on and using a Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I'd rather not touch from a laptop or PC.\u02d5 Chromium happens to be one of the safest OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack it. And, as far as I know, Chromium wasn't cracked yet.\u02d5 Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns for compromising privacy. If you have a Google account you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment, including Chrome extensions, shortcuts and so forth.\u02d5 Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than getting slower and slower and gradually falling into obsolescence.\u02d5 Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while they tend to get very busy for a few minutes or longer once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades download and install. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place out in the clouds they don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.\u02d5 The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it also negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.\u02d5 Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.\u02d5 While you don't get the top of the line CPU on a $299 Chromebook, performance is much better than that same CPU on a traditional laptop because there's no need to constantly run virus scans, there is on disk fragmentation to deal with, among other things.\u02d5 No need to worry about backups and losing your data. Yes, keeping your important or very personal data in the cloud is not something that I do or I would advise anyone to do but 'everything else' should reside in the cloud just fine and the odds of that data ever being lost are quite small.\u02d5 Quite versatile. You can easily pair your Chromebook with Bluetooth (or dongled) mice, keyboards and speakers. And you can even use a remote desktop app to access a 'true' PC when you really need one. You can make phone calls and video calls and you can even play some games.\u02d5 Runs Ubuntu. I haven't tried it yet myself because... well... I have Ubuntu running on a PC already but if you Google Chromebook Ubuntu or Chromebook Linux you will get a few posts that explain exactly how it's done.\u02d5 Works offline too. Yes, it's not a laptop but there are apps that work well offline and if you don't trust Google's cloud you can access your own local NAS at least for viewing docs, PowerPoint slides or playing videos. There must be a way to save edited docs in your own cloud rather than Google's but I didn't spend much time trying to figure it out yet.\u02d5 Relatively low prince, 11.6\" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard\u02d5 core gaming even though you CAN do them, it's just that you can do them better on a PC or laptop or tablet. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use device and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'. Chromebooks, now that we have three of them around are what our kids prefer for their school\u02d5 related activity and most of their entertainment, when not playing games.ACER's C720pHaven't spent a lot of time with the 720p but, and not surprisingly so, it's all very familiar because this is our third Chromebook. The 720p is not 'exactly like' HPs or Samsung's but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook and that's a good thing.There are many common features between our three Chromebooks but there are quite a few important differences so here's what it's probably worth to mention:\u02d5 Touch, of course. I didn't spend a lot of time with the much more expensive Pixel but the C720p does what I expected. It's not an iPad or a Nexus 7 when it comes to responsiveness but it's quite decent and it's good to have options.\u02d5 The LED 1366 x 768p HD display resolution is no different from the other Chromebooks and I would say it's somewhere in between HPs (better) and Samsung's. But the differences are minor.\u02d5 USB 3.0, USB 2.0 and HDMI ports plus the SD card slot make the C720p a relatively easy to connect device, especially when compared to HPs.\u02d5 Intel Celeron 2955U processor with (only) 2GB of DDR3 RAM makes it the fastest Chromebook. I suspect that a 4GB model is going to be available soon but even with 2GB it still feels fine.\u02d5 Decent speakers. Quite impressive, in fact for their size.\u02d5 Great keyboard, as far as the chicklets keyboards come. I prefer it to the others but keyboards can be such a personal thing. It's the typical Chromebook layout and the key travel is good. As a touch typist it took me little time to get used to it.\u02d5 Good battery life. They promise 7\u02d5 8 hours. I don't know how realistic that may be but at 75% brightness ours ran for almost six ours after a full charge.\u02d5 Same freebies Google: 100GB in the clouds for 2 years being the most attractive.RATINGI am not going to compare Acer's Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because the 200\u02d5 300 dollar Chromebooks are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one may prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.Acer's device is at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung and, while not as pretty, it seems to be speedier and definitely much better connected than HPs. The price difference can be justified by the touch capability which is nice to know it's there.Chromebooks and the C720p are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as a revolutionary device as tablets.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast, Light, and Fun to Use", "Author": "George F. Rice \"free software fan\"", "ReviewID": "R3QJ03J9ISRUZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife pre-ordered the C720P as my Christmas gift, but we couldn't wait to exchange our \"big\" gift - after 27 years, we understand each other well.  :-D  So when the box arrived last night (delayed 3 excruciating days by the recent ice storm), I became a brand new Chromebook owner.Opening the box revealed the Chromebook, power supply brick, standard PC power cable, and a \"getting started\" sheet. Getting started is trivial - plug it in (though it was 79% charged on arrival), pick a language, login to Google, and (optionally) follow a brief but informative tour. I've used the Chrome browser on Windows and Ubuntu desktops and my Nexus 4, so I'm already somewhat invested in the Chrome ecosystem. As a result, I felt right at home - all of my Google services and apps I had installed via the Chrome browser were ready to use, and a familiar Chromecast icon pre-connected my Chromebook to our TV.ChromeOS feels quite natural if you've used Windows 7 - a \"grid\" icon in the lower left yields a start menu with your Chrome apps, with quick-launch icons and underlined active programs shown to its right. My grid has several pages, since I had already selected apps via my Chrome browsers on other machines - I instinctively swiped through the pages exactly as I would on a tablet. The lower right of the screen shows the time, volume, wifi strength, battery status, and the current user's picture (I snapped a new one with the webcam on my first login, but all that grey hair caused me to switch back to my younger self instead).Touch interaction is so natural that my daughter, watching setup over my shoulder, asked, \"So, does the touchscreen work?\"  I pointed out that I hadn't used the trackpad yet - all of my interaction had been touching the screen or typing. Tablets have changed the way we interact with computers of all types, so it's a huge win to have responsive and natural touch on such an inexpensive laptop. And it's really cool to go back a page in the browser just by swiping from left to right - I'll be trying this on my non-touch desktops with increasing frustration, I just just know it.The keyboard works extremely well. I'm an 82 wpm touch typist, and have had no trouble at all whipping out this review. The layout is similar enough to a standard PC that I adapted without effort. The standard function key row uses iconography for browser, screen, and volume control and a power switch, and there's no Windows key (of course) or Delete (I use Alt-Backspace). But typing is quick and easy, and far faster for me than on my iPad, even with its optional tabletop physical keyboard.I'm strongly biased toward over-buying RAM, so the 2 GB on this device worried me a little. However, I've had a dozen tabs open with no performance hit at all, and I loaded the Amiga 500 emulator in a Chrome browser window with very similar performance to my 16 GB quad-core Ubuntu workstation. As with most light laptops, the RAM is not expandable, so I'm relieved.ChromeOS on this laptop is *very* fast, with a light and breezy feeling that I quite enjoy. The app store is gratifyingly large - not Android large, but enough that I haven't failed to find anything that I have needed yet. If you have an old specialty Windows program on which you depend, you'll want a more expensive Windows laptop, but otherwise, I don't think you'll have a problem finding what you want, and will be able to window shop (Chrome shop?) for many happy hours. Over a billion apps served, and the newer apps work off-line (though I have not yet tested this).Although I've only used it for one evening, I'm exceptionally pleased with this product. My son (a senior in Computer Science) used the non-touch C720 model for his classwork last semester, running Ubuntu and ChromeOS simultaneously, and he recommended the C720P to me when I began considering a new laptop. I'm happy to recommend it to you.UPDATE: After 4 days, I've learned a bit more. The battery lasts for about 2 days of fairly heavy and somewhat intermittent use, around 9 hours total. Wifi is rock solid, and interaction with our Chromecast is reliable and seamless. I have 18 tabs open right now, including 3 Drive documents, Gmail, Angry Birds, and the App Store, and it's just as responsive as when I first turned it on. Pinch-to-zoom works fine in apps such as Maps, but it does NOT zoom on a normal web page - I use Ctrl-+ for that. The new off-line apps worked fine when I intentionally took it out of wifi range.The Chromebook has a large number of keyboard shortcuts, by the way - you can press Ctrl-Alt-? to bring up an on-screen \"cheat sheet\" keyboard overlay, then press various combinations of Ctrl, Alt, and Shift to see what each shortcut does. Pressing Esc closes the overlay and gets you back to work or play.Still learning, and still having a blast!", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "A GREAT PORTABLE COMPUTER DEVICE AT A GREAT PRICE!", "Author": "drkcope", "ReviewID": "REVK9LNL3MM20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have an Acer C720P ($299) and an Acer C720 ($199) and both are amazing machines. If you dont mind plunking down the extra $100 for the touchscreen then go for it but really you will do fine without it and save yourself $100 especially if you are buying these as gifts like I did for others in my family.Here is a list of the APPS I use on both and it runs them fast and flawlessly:Facebook, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Chrome Remote Desktop (flawlessly connects to my Windows 7 laptop and I can run any windows program remotely with ease), LogMeIn (flawlessly connects to my Office Desktop and I can access all my office records which is key since i am a family doc), Google Cloud Print (easily prints documents to all the printers i have set up), MyBible, Kindle, Twitter, Hootsuite, Weatherbug, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube, Google+ photos (automatically puts all my photos taken on my Iphone over to my chromebook), RUNS ALL WEBSITES INCLUDING BANKING WEBSITES and my mobile hospital app FLAWLESSLY WITH CHROME (including adobe flash player sites which my Ipad and Iphone still wont run)The only CONS i can find so far is no SKYPE app.....If you want to do video calls then need to use GOOGLE HANGOUTS which is much less intuitive than skype....and you CANNOT hook a printer directly to a chromebook but you can use google cloud print to print easily...needs wifi connection to do most things (this is really not a problem for me as i am always connected and they have developed a number of apps that work when not connected including document writer and email offline)Battery Life Amazing! almost 8hrs of use!Touchscreen good but not like an Ipad (can't use your fingers to zoom in with pinch)Touchpad very good! (and really dont need the touchscreen because touchpad works so well)Keyboard very solid,Can use any wireless mouse with it. (Ipad still cant utilize a mouse)Screen brightness great.Sound adequate but a bit tinnyUSB port which can use flash drives to move and transfer files (another thing I still cant do with my Ipad)2 years free of 100GB Google Drive (this saves you $120 right there)12 free wifi passes while on planes  (i dont fly much but still a nice convenience and saves you the $10 or so connection fee)Free virus protectionAll in all a great economical way to access the internet with ease and lightning speed and do 95% of what most people use a personal computer for this day and age.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "5 Star Computer Because of the Price - Student", "Author": "Joseph", "ReviewID": "R15SGV04BNNYRG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I initially tried out the HP Chromebook 11 but did not like it and my parents have the older Samsung Chromebook so this review will talk a little bit about why I like this one the best and different features of this laptop.  Like the title says, this is, in my opinion, a 5 star device because of the \"bang for the buck\" you get with this device.  This device is new so the prices have been crazy recently and way over what this should be listed for.  It is supposed to be $299.99 and if the price is over that, wait until it gets fixed.  The prices are going back and forth right now for some reason until more stock is acquired I assume.Update:  Tips/Tricks section added to bottom.I am a college student and I think this device or any other Chromebook makes for an excellent 2nd laptop and that is what this is for me.  I have a much more powerful laptop with 17 inch screen and i7 processor for my computer programming projects or anything (I am a Business Information Systems/Technology major) more serious where something must be installed or something.  I also use my main computer for campus printing as it is what I am already familiar with.Let me start with the \"criticisms\" that some people may discuss or may want to know before buying:  Screen and speakers then I will go into the rest of the device.Screen:  It is a TOUCHSCREEN.  This screen is not quite as good visually as the HP 11 if I am being honest.  The HP 11's screen is actually really good especially for a Chromebook but this screen looks just fine still.  One thing I have noticed after using this for a bit is that the \"viewing angles\" are not so great.  I personally do not foresee this being any issue because this is not going to be a laptop for watching movies or anything like that.  When looking straight at the screen or from the sides, there is not much issue but going far up or far down, colors begin to become distorted.This particular model features a touchscreen and that works MUCH better than I expected.  The screen feels very solid like glass.  There has been no flexing or anything of the screen and the touch is really awesome.  You can swipe from the left side of the screen towards the right to go \"back\" in your browser to your previous page and very cool things like that with it.  The touchscreen is one of the major things that got me to go with this computer.  You can do so much with the touchscreen which I really like and was wondering about before I bought this.  I was afraid it would be very limited but it actually does a lot more than I expected such as the example I gave about being able to swipe across the screen to go back to your last webpage.  The touchscreen is extremely accurate just like an iPhone or tablet should be.  Scrolling down pages with the touch is very smooth and accurate and if you release your touch, the screen will glide down.  Pushing the tiny \"x\" button on a Chrome browser tab is actually pretty easy and you get more used to it.  The screen is very quick and responsive.  The screen hinge offers some resistance so that when you tap the screen, it does not fall backwards on you and I will detail this more under the Frame/Body section towards the bottom.Speakers:  This is the only other thing I know of so far that one could ask to be better.  The speakers are located on the bottom of the device.  They still seem to play partially through the keyboard - though they are on the bottom so it is mostly coming from the bottom.  This won't give you the most ideal sound experience but it isn't bad and if you are buying this to mostly listen to music, you might want to consider an iPhone or mp3 player instead of a Chromebook.  I use headphones most of the time anyways.  I just did a side-by-side comparison to my 17 inch i7 laptop and the headphone sound is the same.  I swear with the HP 11, even the headphone sound was of lower quality than that of my much more expensive i7 laptop and I am not sure why.Keyboard:  The keyboard is great for a $300 device with all the features this laptop has.  I am typing this entire review on the C720P right now and having no issues.  The keys do not have a huge amount of \"return\" as in they don't compress a lot but I do not personally have any issues with that - it is just the way they are.  This has taken some getting used to for me but I see no advantage/disadvantage to this Acer keyboard over the HP 11 or Samsung Chromebooks, they are each different and I have liked them all.  The texture of the keys feel good to my fingers and have a slight \"texture\" to them.  Because of the low amount of return on my keyboard keys, they type pretty quietly which is sort of nice for taking to my classes so I do not disturb people around me.Touch pad:  This touch pad is by far my favorite out of the Acer C720P, HP 11, and Samsung.  This touchpad is fully clickable, just like the rest but this one just feels way better to my hand.  It is completely smooth and when you push down on it to click, it gives you a very nice, solid response that you know you have clicked it and I just like that feel.Frame/Body:  I waited for the release of this white body because I thought it looked better than the original slate color.  I am happy with the way it looks in person also.  The feel is sort of a \"matte\" feel and is not glossy like the HP 11 (if you've seen it) which I think is a good thing because that means it should show WAY less fingerprints.  The frame does not flex or bend whatsoever so far and I have tried to see if I could get it to.  Very sturdy frame/body.Another thing about the body of this device that relates to the screen, the screen stands firm and gives you some resistance when closing/opening it which is great because it is a touchscreen and you don't want to be tapping a button on screen and having to hold the back with your other hand or have to pick it back up right after you tap the screen and it falls back a half inch.  This is another positive to me and by no means is it difficult to open or close, it just has a perfect amount of resistance to resist falling backwards after touching the screen.  Lightweight, sturdy, clean.  I just tried to fit it into a protective sleeve I bought when I had my HP 11 (the sleeve fit over the HP 11 and was made to fit Macbook Air) but this sleeve did not zip shut when I had the C720P inside.  It fit into it fine, but hung out the opening to where my sleeve would not zip.  So the form factor is bigger than the HP 11 as well though again, this doesn't bother me personally - just something to note.Webcam/Camera:  I was actually impressed with the quality of the camera/webcam on this device.  I never expect a whole lot from webcams in the first place but I feel that this one was done well.  No, this doesn't produce a crystal clear image but it does actually pretty well and has a lot of different filters you can apply (Probably like all Chromebooks) with the camera app.  The delay is pretty minimal when you are moving side to side for example.  It keeps up pretty well and not that I video-chat a lot, but I am content/happy with this camera and I think it takes decent pictures for a low cost laptop.Charger:  The charging port is a very small hole on the left side of the device but the charger does have a small power brick with it like most laptops I have seen (but not all).  The charger/brick is lightweight though and shouldn't bother me.  The device typically can go from extremely low power up to 100% charge in about 2 hours which then gives you 7-8 hours of use (more battery info below).BATTERY USE UPDATE:  Acer claims 7.5 hours and I promised to give my input after some more use.  Screen brightness is the main factor to battery life from my experience.  When having the brightness set to around 50% (a little dim for me), I can easily get over 8+ hours of battery.  When at 100% brightness, I believe the battery life is more around 7 hours and so I have decided to keep my screen brightness around 70-75% and I have seen 7.5-8 hours of use on this setting while this C720P is brand new.  This is based on pretty regular usage which consists of some YouTube video playing with sound, casual web browsing/email, and taking notes with Google Drive.  When charging up from extremely low battery, it takes roughly 2 hours to get fully charged which I am happy with.  I will try to continue to update the battery life if I notice it being any different or changing on me over time or in different situations.After doing MORE battery testing from having this device even longer, I am seeing very good numbers by this C720P in its early life.  In class taking notes on Google Drive, I was able to see 8+ hours of screen time.  I say 8+ because I believe it was 8 hours 20 minutes and possibly a little more up to 8.5 hours.  This is with screen brightness around 65% which for me is adequate for note taking/light browsing.  I will continue to update as my usage increases and time goes on.Why get a Chromebook?For me, I am taking this to class each day and taking notes from my college professors.  I type much faster than I write and this helps me get more information into my notes before moving to the next PowerPoint slide.  This is a lightweight, small, easy to use device.  It turns on very quickly, types well, and the touch screen makes it cooler but yet you are only spending $300.This device is great especially as a secondary computer for just doing stuff on the Internet or taking to meetings, classes, etc.  I don't have to put any anti-virus software on it or any extra programs so what you pay for the device is essentially all you pay for.Chromebooks are, in my opinion, sort of between a tablet and a full laptop because they are not either.  They are like a laptop in that they look and act like a laptop which is great because I just like having a track pad and keyboard attached to a screen/touchscreen.  This device has 1 USB 3.0 port, 1 USB 2.0 port, HDMI out port, SD card slot, headphone port, a space where you can insert a cable to secure the Chromebook to a table or desk to avoid being stolen, really convenient buttons along the top row of the keyboard for back, forward, refresh, full screen mode, change page, brightness, and volume.  They are like a tablet in that they cannot technically do everything your typical laptop can.  They don't install programs (they install apps from the Chrome web store) and they do not have a CD drive (although more and more laptops are getting rid of their CD drives).I really like Chrome OS which is what this device runs instead of Windows 8 or Mac OS X.  It is simple, quick, easy to use and get used to, and I really like that about it and another big reason I went with a Chromebook.Updates to come:Performance: Still doing some testing on this and I will update after a few days of both regular and heavy use.Comment and let me know what else you are interested in knowing about through my review and I will update that as well!For those that have the device/are ordering, here are some tips and tricks I have found using the unique touch screen:1. Swipe your finger from the left side of the screen over to the right and release -- this will act as a \"back\" button.2. Swipe your finger from the right side of the screen over to the left and release -- this will act as a \"forward\" button.3. Touch the \"minimize browser\" square in the top right of the screen, swipe down and release.  This will minimize your browser by using the touch screen.4. Using the same \"square\" in the top right of your browser screen, you can touch it and swipe left to put the page to the left of the screen.5. Using that same square again, swipe right to put your current browser page on only the right half of the screen.  This is nice because for me, it really covers just half of the screen - great if needing to multitask.6. Swipe up on the top right square and it will \"maximize\" your browser page.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Acer C720p Chromebook: New User Experience", "Author": "lummox pandit \"lummox\"", "ReviewID": "R3ELHQEUMDDHJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To be honest, I am very new to the chromebook world however after only a few hours of using this machine I am instantly hooked!!  I currently have an old dell inspiron and MacBook (2008) so this was a big leap for me. My primary goal with this unit is to work online when needed and occasionally write documents and basic projects for my young kids (3 & 6).Shipping: Took a few days longer than expected but despite the cold temperatures, the unit came undamaged and was sealed properly as I would expect it to be.Unboxing: Chromebook was operational within 3-4 seconds of pressing the power button and battery life showed almost 80% right from the start. Everything was included as it should be and all items worked when plugged in.Screen: I have seen some reviewers complain about a blue tint on the screen however I did not notice that. I realize this is not a pixel or MacBook etc but for the cost I am extremely pleased with the screen thus far. I used the laptop in low light and with full overhead lights yet no issues for me on this front.Sound: I wasn't blown away by the sound when I was on ESPN however I have external speakers so I am not overly concerned with that. If I need to use the sound for an educational game or youtube then the internal speakers should suffice but I think you could do yourself a favor and purchase a Bluetooth speaker ( I have bose sound link mini and it is amazing).Keyboard / Track pad: This was a major point of contention for me before the unboxing because of my experience with my brother's Samsung chromebook. I hated that track pad and was concerned this would come off as flimsy and cheap. I am glad to report that my fear was unjustified and I was actually pleasantly surprised with how natural and easy it felt to use this. I didn't get the feeling of a \"lesser unit\" while typing and clicking the pad. So far so good!Touchscreen: I had to keep telling myself \"this isn't a tablet\" and be careful when pressing the screen. I guess for me this takes some time getting used to however the screen was very responsive when I clicked on the toolbar or highlighted certain things and clicked on a link etc. For $299 to have a touchscreen that works I am extremely happy!!I was able to put my usb drive in easily and my word documents opened up EXACTLY as they had with my Dell. So all of my saved files that I intend to transfer to the C720p look like they will be intact and that is an added bonus. Again, I am new to the  google side of things but overall I am happy with my experience and going forward I anticipate the chromebook will continue to make major headway over Microsoft and possibly certain apple laptops (which are nice but way overpriced IMO).Cons: My only real issue so far is that I wish this came with 4gb of memory as opposed to 2gb. It certainly isn't a deal breaker for me but it is nice to have that option. I was able to open 5 tabs and didn't feel the performance lagged for me. I have not tried using chromecast yet and hope that this model will suffice when using the cast. I will update once I have had a chance to merge the 2 together  I am sure an update with this model will come in the next 4-6 months but for now this laptop does what I need it to and I love this purchase.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply AMAZING!!!", "Author": "Michael P hudak", "ReviewID": "R3R6F18RH38AJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What can I say other then i love it and Acer did good with this one.

I have to say, speakers are so important to me on a small computer, and these are AMAZING, cranking out really loud, rich sound that doesn't distort.For those of you considering a switch to Chrome OS, just do it!  I haven't looked back once, have traveled to half a dozen countries with my Chromebook, and have never had a problem.  Everything I do is online anyway, and there are offline versions of Gmail and Google Sheets... but then again, I've pretty much never been without a connection anywhere... and if I am without a wi-fi connection, I create one from my phone, or I just use my phone, or I rent a 4G/Wi-Fi hotspot in other countries (sometimes free if you rent a place through airbnb in a lot of countries, otherwise about $5-10/day if you rent one at a foreign airport).  And as you know, more and more of google's apps are usable offline.Everything works through Chrome, you can store files locally but just as easily save to your Google drive on the cloud... at this price, I think I'm getting something that would/should be over $1000... and something that wasn't even imaginable a few years ago... if you told me there'd be a lightweight, touchscreen computer, with 8 hours of battery life for this price I never would have believed it.  If you then told me that I'd never have to worry about the thing getting viruses and all my docs would be stored online, I'd never believe you.  I used to have panic thinking about backups and what happens if I lose, forget, or have my computer stolen... not anymore...I'm sold, I'm sold, I'm sold.  Once you try one, you'll want to buy others for friends and family... plus it's Amazon, you can try it for a while and if you don't like it, return it.... but I think you'll love it.  And before anyone gets negative about anything, remember you're talking about some amazing features for an extremely attractive price... you should be highly supportive of anything that is such a game changer as this computer, because the competition brings about new features and lower prices and helps consumers everywhere.You'll love it.

I won\u2019t bombard you with a bunch of technical talk about what makes the hardware so much better than another comparable product, because frankly it doesn\u2019t answer the question, \u201cis it right for me?\u201d I have had the same Toshiba laptop for the past four years, and with me getting tired of the constant lag behind of doing simple tasks, i decided to purchase this chromebook. When I purchased it, I was well aware of what I was getting. I did not feel like shelling out twice as much money for material I know I will never use. With that being said, know that I use my computers for average web-surfing and homework. I do not play a ton of games or watch a ton of videos, my usage of these products are very limited. If this at all sounds like you, than this chromebook is for you.The keyboard: Has a nice spacing out, and while some dislike the \u201cchiclity\u201d type keys, I feel they are sturdy enough to handle the most common bit of word processing. Hitting the shift button while trying to capitalize certain letters has gotten be hitting the arrow buttons, but that may just be my inexperience. There is no function keys, which someone who has had a chromebook before probably knows this already. I do like the easy access to volume adjustments at the top of the keyboard. Overall, it feels just like a keyboard, I can type on it comfortably, so this really isn\u2019t a deal breaker.The touchpad: Is what threw me off at first, I am used to the touchpad with the left and right click buttons. This touch pad has an integrated button so it is something new, as convenient as that may be, I have been having trouble with the \u201cright-click.\u201d Otherwise, I do not feel any lag when I use it, but I did have to adjust the touchpad speed, but that is just a preference.Software: It runs on googleOS.. DUH. So it doesn\u2019t leave as many options to have your special programs and applications like some other OS. Though you can run Ubuntu I have decided that it really isn\u2019t that big of a deal to me. The common applications, google docs and other things I would need for my homework is just as easy, for me, to use as microsoft office. It is just like other chromebooks, so that would sum that up.The screen: At times the deal breaker, I know I\u2019m paying 300 dollars for the entire product, that the screen was not going to be outstanding. I am however, extremely impressed. Like I mentioned before, I don\u2019t plan to do much video watching but this screen is better than the one than my old laptop, which at the time cost around the same price. The touchscreen just sweetens up the deal. It works effortlessly and have not experienced any kind of problem, except for the occasional clicking on the wrong thing, but i did that on my $250 tablet.Overall: This was probably the best $300 I have ever spent. It is perfect for what I will use it for. Virtually silent until you lay your head next to the SSD. The screen while not being the LED screen you may want, well worth what you paid for. I look at it as the price of the tablet, but with that you are getting an attached keyboard and 100GB free on google drive for two years. This is a great school chromebook and business chromebook, and anyone who is looking to just do some homework and web-surfing would love. Just know, you are not getting the top of the line laptop, but you are getting a high quality piece of equipment with no bloatware and no worries.

However, it is a Chromebook and as such, people considering it for purchase should be aware that this is Google's ChromeOS and not a Windows system. If you use many of Google's services, as I do, you will feel right at home with ChromeOS. For those of you not familiar with ChromeOS, it is an operating system based on Google's Chrome browser and it requires an internet connection for optimal use. So, if you are looking for a system in this price range to browse the web, check e-mail, make video calls (Google Hangouts, NOT Skype) and some other light computing, this is probably on of the best values available. There are no programs to load, so you simply log in with your Google account and you are good to go. Google has made Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Slides available for offline use (although, I must admit, it was a little tougher than I expected to get Docs, Sheets and Slides setup for offline use). Google gives you 100GB of cloud storage (for two years) when you purchase the Chromebook.The C720P has a touchscreen and I find myself using the touchscreen for scrolling webpages and navigating though webpages. I discovered accidentally that you can move webpages back or forward by simply swiping your finger across the screen! Really cool! This can also be done be sliding both fingers across the trackpad.If you have any needs for installed apps such as MS Office (and Office Web Apps do not meet your needs), Photoshop, or other programs, then perhaps a Chromebook is not for you. Otherwise, as long as you know what ChromeOS can and cannot do, I believe this is one of the best Chromebooks available today.4/19/2014 - Update - I purchased this Chromebook since it was released and I am feeling the need to update this initial review now that I have been using it for a while. The Acer 720P has become my daily driver while I am on the road and even at home. Since the Chromebook was released, Google has updated ChromeOS multiple times, adding in supervised users and also pinch to zoom, which is great for the touchscreen! Battery life is very solid and the 7.5 hours they quote is real as long as you stay with Acer's default brightness settings. If you increase brightness, battery is closer to 5-7 hours depending on how bright you set it. The main thing I appreciate about this Chromebook is its performance. It is pretty snappy and,  after 5 months of use, it lives up to Google's claim of only getting better.

The 1.4 GHz Haswell chip does well at video on the computer screen but wasn't able to properly display on the chromecast.  Overall, the Acer computer is a very fast, responsive and nicely displayed computer.  The touch screen, is still difficult for small objects and doesn't always respond to double touching to enable a link.  However, the track pad works perfect so anything you can't do on the touch is easily overcome.  Overall, this is a very cool computer for the price and it does quite a bit for the cost.  I'm buying one for my Mom for Christmas and it will do everything she needs.  I suspect HP, Samsung and Asus will each come out with a similar device some time next year.  They will likely be slightly more fashionable with bigger screens.  I just can't wait that long.1/16/14 Just an update, after several months of use.  The Chromebook works amazing and is able to chromecast in the lower resolution no problem.  Many applications are taking on the chrome casting feature within the application.

Since 98 percent of my IT work is online and web based, I don't require Windows for much of anything. My main computer is actually a Macbook Pro which has Parallels and Windows 8 installed so the Samsung Chromebook was the new kid on the block.  The only thing missing from it was the touch factor and this Acer C720P completes things.  Comparing the two, the ACER is a little heavier but feels more solid to hold in your hand, partially due to the screen/glass being very solid. The Samsung however is a little thinner and feels like you have a Macbook Air in your hand. (it even looks like an air). But this review is about the Acer Touchscreen... the out of box experience was painless as in all chromebooks, so long as you have a google account (who doesn't these days). You sign in and everything is there for you. The charge time is short.. less than 60 minutes I should say--maybe 55 minutes. The up time so far has been easily 8 hours if not 9.. I failed to keep track exactly and have yet to run completely dry, although it is a good idea to let it run down at least once a month and then charge fully to get the max life out of your battery. Even if these batteries are not supposed to get a memory, the over all life will be much longer if you do drain it completely.  I am a firm believer is simply using the device. Whether it is on a desk and plugged in all day does not matter, nor does it hurt the battery because there are then days I will use nothing but battery. Since you do get a full day on the battery, you can of course use it that way but if it is on your desk, having the unit plugged in will only help from having the screen sleep as often, not that a simple swipe of the touch pad is that difficult.So should you be buying this unit (compared to the Samsung for example)?  Yes, absolutely!  As much as I love my Samsung,I do really wish it had a touchscreen, simply because the more I use a laptop with touchscreen, the more I find myself reaching out to use it on a non-touch device like my MacPro or Samsung Chromebook.The keys are full sized and have are raised a little higher than on the Samsung, but easier to press so if that is an issue for you...The touchpad measures the same width but a little narrower than the Samsung, not that this is an issue since you have the touchscreen as well, but the touchpad is as sensitive as you make it and the same gestures as other chromebooks.Speed is and always has been amazingly great on these units.. in fact as the upgrades happen the speeds increase as well. What other operating system does that? Certainly not Windows!  If you are on the fence about chromebook because you use Windows for \"office\" items, you should get off of it (the fence) because the Google Docs/Drive is great and only getting better. Yes, you can use it offline so stop worrying.. add the bonus features of gogo inflight and additional drive space for 2 years.. that pretty much means you are getting a computer for under $100 so what are you waiting for?!", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Redefining Personal Computing", "Author": "M.M", "ReviewID": "RCO7LZBQBQ497", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me first start by complementing Amazon on their stellar Customer Service. I had an issue with the shipping of this product, and I had a response and solution to my problem within 20 minutes of emailing them.If you want an abridged version, scroll to the bottom. I tend to ramble.Much research led me to expect an average quality experience due to many professional reviewers (not Amazon customer reviews) giving the idea that this product somehow suffered from \"issues\" such as poor screen angle visibility, average keyboard response etc. In hindsight, these reviewers are displaying snobbery and entitlement issues.Keeping in mind that this product is a $300 bare bones laptop, I can truthfully say that I am thoroughly impressed by both the quality of the hardware, and the extreme fluidity and ease of use of the Chrome OS. At this price, one cannot expect much, but at any price, it is rare that a product exceeds expectation.Acer has proven that they can cut costs without impinging too much on the usability of a product. Make no mistake though, this is not a bells and whistles computer. If you want glass touchpads, aluminum framing and a computer of such high pedigree that it runs off of caviar, look elsewhere. The C720P is a utility device in every way, but it provides everything a student such as myself needs without any extra fluff that serves little other than to perpetuate the consumer dogma.The Keyboard is responsive and sturdy with good tactile feedback and travel. It is functionally equivalent to the highest end laptop keyboards except that it does not have a back light and the texture is less smooth to the touch. Neither of these affect how the keyboard actually performs however. It is full sized and sacrifices no usability.The chassis is made of a durable plastic that does not flex. While it may seem less impressive than aluminum bodies, there is little functional difference between the two. The visual appearance is generic aptly reflecting the overall utilitarian theme of the C720P.Where many computers make sacrifices to cover cost is within the screen technology. Screens are the single most costly component of any laptop, and it goes without saying that you can't produce a $300 laptop without concessions in this area. As such, the screen is quite basic, but it meets all requirements. The resolution is fine enough to do anything you'd do with any other computer. Spoiled eyes will notice a large difference that may take time to get used to, but it is perfectly acceptable for movies, reading, and typing. The brightness is also quite fine. There are reviews reflecting negatively on it's lower brightness compared to other laptops, but in practice, it is quite sufficient. Sometimes having a brighter screen can actually be harder on the eyes anyways. Viewing angles are a bit small and in general, the screen is where the cost-cutting shows through. It's not an amazing screen, but for $300 you get a good display. As a final note about the screen, the touch ability is just right. It works very well. Anyone familiar with touch devices will find themselves right at home.Where the C720P stands above even high end laptops is in battery life. The best word to describe the battery life is \"Beastly\". You'll easily get 6 hours out of this thing no matter what you do. I've been using mine for 6 hours already watching videos, remote controlling my desktop computer, doing homework, typing this review, installing apps.. you name it. I am currently showing as having over 5 hours still remaining. No doubt there are people out there who could drain it into the ground, but as an excited first day owner, I've used it extensively and the battery is just waking up.Much of the battery performance is due to very low energy hardware. The specs on this machine are very low. Many people may fear that this means it will chug along like a drunkard at a beer fest, but I can tell you without doubt that the power is more than adequate. I've had no slow down or performance issues with anything. Much of this is due to the efficiency of Chrome OS, but Acer has also opted to put the value where it matters by maximizing meaningful performance.Finally, the purpose for any Chromebook and the star behind the screen would be the Chrome OS. Make no mistake, haters discounting it as nothing but a browser are sorely mistaken. I use Linux, iOS, OSX, and Windows 7 and 8. Now, Chrome is hands down my favorite due to its simplicity and effectiveness. Gone are the days of searching for windows  in the background or juggling screen swapping features. When all of your computing is organized in tabs, immediately and constantly updated, and your hardware doesn't have to hold a cumbersome OS over its head every waking moment, things come together so fluidly that I am amazed no one has done this sooner. Even on my desktop, chrome browser is where I spend most of my time. It's not because of choice but because it is just so darn efficient to do things with google where I can as opposed to a stagnant, cumbersome OS.Are other OS obsolete then? Not yet. As senior Engineering student, I still require the use of dedicated installation type of software for heavy work, but for anything else, this is an effective replacement. However, the ease with which I can do graphs, make calculations, compose spreadsheets, write word documents, form and organize to do lists, make complete display projects from scratch, and even use installed software through remote desktop functionality (simple as a few button clicks no lie), it becomes obvious just how insightful Google has been. Apple and Microsoft have reason to fear.Acer too deserves praise. They recognized an opportunity by being the first ones to develop hardware specifically for Google's OS. It's a decision that will most certainly reward them going forward. It helps that their product is a superb piece of hardware at its price point. The C720P is snappy and durable. While the specs may not seem like much, remember that Chrome OS requires but a fraction of the hardware support to run. Pound for Pound, Chrome OS is hands down the most efficient OS and the stats on this product are more than sufficient to run it at full capacity.****Abridged Version Below****I firmly recommend the Acer C720P as an outstanding product at $300 dollars", "Date": "January 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Check out WIFI issues.

It is a nice unit, in many regards, but its WIFI reception is too unreliable.  Google \"Acer 720 WIFI disconnect problems\" to get a broader view of the issue (or non-issue).  The WIFI reception may be a problem for many users or may only be a problem for a few (if you sell a lot of units, a low percentage of problem machines sold to a low percentage of users can generate a lot of complaints).Regardless, my 720P's unreliable WIFI reception is a problem for me.  In one situation, I have just given up trying to use it as it spends more time disconnected than connected. Meanwhile, the laptops next to me are working like a charm.  (in other situations, my 720 works fine).-Acer forums have advice for those who have connection issues, some of which includes reconfiguring your router or your computer or both, advice which has met with mixed results (and which didn't help me at all). I need this machine to work in multiple situations with multiple routers and I am not about to ask if I can try reconfigure someone else's router when it is working perfectly for them.  Nor do I want to mess around with my router when it works perfectly with every other wireless unit in the house.  Nor am I interested in messing around fruitlessly re-setting the internal settings of a computer I purchased for its simplicity and ease of use.-I don't know what the problem is with my 720's WIFI.  Nor do I care.  Someone else can figure it out.  I am returning mine.-Bear in mind, I am reporting my experience with a particular 720P.  Other people, most, it appears, are quite pleased with theirs.  But, my review needs to be based on my experience, not that of others. If reports of poor WIFI reception and irritating disconnects prove to be rare, then there is little to be concerned about.

But, thought my review will help others on Amazon.I have had the original CR-48 chromebook from Google (sent free) 3 yrs ago. It revolutionized the way we use home computer. I had to choose another chromebook, for sure, as I knew I was not going to get the battery life, performance, durability, reliability from a Windows machine (with the web only use, which is what chromebook is meant for).I did a lot of study and on different manufacturers for a chromebook. This Acer 720P ended up being my choice. First, I have to commend Acer for many things. I ordered on the morning of Dec 23. It was in my hands next day, on Christmas Eve. Acer offered free overnight shipping along with 10% discount on that day. I only paid $285 (incl. tax). Also, they probably charged the laptop full. Because when I opened it, it was 80% full. I never expected to have it that soon and that service from Acer.This computer totally exceeded my expectations.. Keyboard: Feels great with rugged feel on the buttons.. Trackpad: I have had trackpad issues when lower part of thumbs were touching and taking the mouse/focus somewhere on the screen. No such issues on this one. The size seems to be right for my fast keyboard typing.. Screen: I was impressed on the quality, for the price. It is not matted look, like I had with CR-48. CR-48 was 13.4\" which was little larger than this one.. Weight: Lightest you can get. Just 2.4lbs. This was one of main criteria to buy a mobile laptop. Feels good in hands and to carry it around. Construction: The base/keyboard feels nice and sturdy. The back of the screen is pasticy, but that does not impact the use of it. It helps keep the laptop from tipping over with light weight. You do not touch it while using the laptop anyway.. Sound: Awesome. I have not had a laptop that sounded as good as this one. Acer did an excellent job on this one.. Google Goodies: Always welcome. Ports: I wanted HDMI for sure. Not many lightweight laptops offered it. This had it along with USB. I wanted the ability to connect to an external HDMI device. So, this was perfect.. Touch: I was really impressed with the touch capabilities of the screen. It is as good as a top of the line tablet. No issues in using it so far.. Performance: Did not see any slowdown when using heavy websites. Scrolling was smooth, and pages loaded faster.. Memory: I preferred the 4GB version but that has not been available from Acer or Amazon for a long time. So, settled with 2 GB. Not sure if that would be a constraint during the lifetime of this machine. But, so far, the machine is handling anything I throw at it.. Battery: We hate to keep the laptops for charging in the middle of the day. This is another criteria for me (to last the battery all day long). I did not run out of the battery yet. When I fully charge it, it says 11:30 hrs, which was awesome! I have been using it for 3/4 hr now, playing video locally and on Chromecast, it is now at 85% full, with 7:17hrs left. Could not be happier..Chromecast: This was the surprise for me. The youtube casting to the TV was instantly HD quality and very smooth. With CR-48, the casting took sometime to get to decent quality. That shows that the performance of this Acer is much better.This is only the first day of my use with this machine. I will update as I use it.

It was unbelievably light, and a friend of mine commented at the time that she'd be afraid it might break too easily. Lo and behold, a few days later the screen developed some strange sort of tear in the upper corner, which needless to say was frustrating, especially given that I'd had the computer for maybe a week at most. I returned it to Amazon, waited a couple of weeks and ordered another, but as soon as I unboxed this one I could see a section of the screen visibly vibrating whenever the screen was moved around, as if it weren't properly constructed or something was loose behind it. I returned that one as well, and after having screen problems with two separate C720s I decided that perhaps this wasn't the computer for me.Weeks later, I got wind of this new model, and after using it for a couple of days I can say that my concerns about sturdiness have all been solved. The touchscreen makes the monitor rock-solid, and though the entire computer is a bit heavier as a result, it's still much lighter than pretty much any other laptop you could buy. It's silent and has tons of battery life - I can mistakenly leave mine on and come back to find it still up and running several hours later. Though it only has 2gigs of memory, as opposed to the 4gigs you could get on a cheaper model, you're probably not going to be doing anything too memory-intensive on it anyway.

She gave me almost four years of flawless service, but, alas, she earned retirement last year, when my university gave me an ipad. Of course, the ipad is a nice little machine, but I can't work with my ipad because the limitations of the platform made by Apple forbids me to do so. So after barely a semester I was already looking for a replacement machine.Bear in mind I didn't want a big heavy machine to work at school or teach my studens. I already have a big, bad, mean machine on my desktop for all my work. So I started looking for a machine that could allow me to work on the go, play some music, watch videos while on the bus back home, and show presentations to my students, but it should have high battery life, low weight, a reasonably big screen and cheap. After a while, I had narrowed down my options to an Asus convertible with Windows 8.1, a Samsung Galaxy Tab and another Acer Aspire. Then I noticed this chromebook's sister, the C720.I started reading reviews, and comparing other chromebook models. My colleagues hated the very concept of the chromebook. I embraced it. After all, I spent almost all my day online, except when I need to work in AutoCAD. I remember trying to work in AutoCAD in Clarice, my old machine, but it was a frustrating experience. Hannibal, my desktop, is a lot more suited for that task.  So if I took AutoCAD out of the equation, the chromebook looked better and better. Then I saw the C720P had touchscreen, and I said \"she will be mine, oh, yes, she will be mine.\" So I purchase her.Ada is a fine piece of computing. I am totally in love with my chromebook. She has great battery life, Chrome OS works like a charm, the battery life is outstanding, the wifi gets signals my ipad can't, and all she lacks is a VGA port, which is good because VGA is an outdated technology. However, I had to buy a converter for the HDMI port, so the projectors in the classroom still work. The keyboard is nice, responsive, and has a good tactile feedback. The trackpad is a little piece of win: it actually has a button under it, so you can click instead of tap... and you can tap too. It is multipoint, so you can scroll with two fingers or call the contextual menu, kinda right click on a common mouse. The USB ports are 2.0 and 3.0, and work with everything you need but printers. The integrated camera does a nice job for videoconferences. The audio could be a little more powerful, though. The SD card supports high-speed cards too. And of course, the HDMI offers hd video.And the screen. The screen. I am SO glad I got the c720p instead of the c720. I use the touchpad all the time, but there are moments, when I am typing fast and furious, where I lost where my pointer is. Or I want to scroll a little bit. Or to press OK. Thank to the touchscreen, I actually press the OK button. It is just like having a big tablet. Almost 30 centimetres (measured diagonally) of touchscreen. Sadly, Ada's screen is glossy, so it is difficult to see when I try to work outside (I prefer to have lunch on the shadow of a nice tree and enjoy the fresh air... if there is such thing when living in a big city). Anyway, the screen, when indoors, looks beautiful. All in all, I've managed to get 6 hours of online work and eight hours of offline work out of this machine. Hell, Ada has been working since five o'clock and, at the time I'm writing this, one in the morning, she still have two and a half hours to go.Then there come the quirks. Of course, the chromebook needs internet to work as it was designed. But there are moments in your life where you are disconnected, you want it or not. This generation of chromebooks has pretty good offline capabilities; yesterday I worked on a couple documents, a spreadsheet and a presentation, while listening music, all offline. Then I got online, added a few images, and sync'd everything in my google drive automagically (and Google got me a hundred gigabytes free for two years, so I don't need to save everything in Ada's 32 GB SSD). I printed my work and went to class, Ada still working happily. Because you can't plug a printer, but you can print. I have an HP P1606 laser printer connected to the network, and she uses HP's eprint. So does the chromebook. It prints exactly as you see it in the screen. Of course, the offline mode doesn't work exactly as online, but it works pretty well. I miss the ability to add images while offline, but I'm sure Google will fix that sooner or later. You can have windows, lots of them, and tabs, also lots of them. You can even maximize, minimize, and pin a window to the desktop. The file manager is a lot on the quick and dirty coding, so it is fairly simple, but it works.Oh, and do you remember what I said about AutoCAD? AutoCAD 360 works like a charm while online, and while offline it allows you to show your drawings. And Autodesk Homestyler also works on ChromeOS. So does Flash, so I can watch videos and sport matches from sites whose player still uses Flash. All chromebooks lack Java support, so I can't watch a couple webcams I used to watch, but I also recognize Java is a security risk and the only legitimate program I use with java is a calculator, so I can live without it.One last thing. You can't really compare this machine with a full-fledged Windows machine. It's not its league. I wanted a machine that does simple tasks but do them fine: the chromebook simply works and boots up in no time (eight seconds, tops). I wanted a machine to do _less_, not one to do _more_. So I am in love with my chromebook. It just works.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast, Touch and does what I need it to do.", "Author": "Steve Bokleman", "ReviewID": "R3DHV51MHD50IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the Acer 720C with the 320GB HDD and 4GB, so I was concerned that I'd be stepping down to the 720P with only 2GB and 32GB SSD. But having the touch screen seemed to override my concerns.The new Chromebook is housed in an all plastic case, but it is by no means \"cheap\" feeling. It has a solid feel and does not flex unless pushed really hard. I carry it daily and so far, no issues with it being \"fragile\".Performance: With only 2GB, I figured I'd see a drop in performance under heavy loads... I'm happy to report that that is not the case. After I completed the setup, I loaded all my normal goodies and started Gmail, G+, Google News etc.. plus opened 15 or so tabs with my favorite Chrome OS sites. No lag! I opened Netflix, logged in and started a HD movie ... still no lag. So overall, I'd say for the average user, 2GB won't be an issue.Touch: Not all applications support touch, but certainly web browsing and most games support touch. The screen is smooth (not etched) to the touch and responds without having to \"double touch\" to make things happen. Drag / drop works great (for the apps that support it).Battery: My 720C suffered from a less than 4 hour battery life. So far, I'm getting 7-8 hours of use before a recharge is needed on the 720P. This is to say that is not 100% use for the 7-8 hours, but certainly I would call it heavy use. Stand-by time is about 1.5 to 2 days, depending on use. Charging fully takes about 2 hours from the AC charger.The only single complaint I will make is the SD slot is not a FULL slot. The SD cards hang about half way out vs. full insertion on the 720C. Not a huge deal, but it makes portability a bit less.All the other ports work fine, I did not have any issues hooking up to the TV via HDMI or external hard drives by the USB 2/3 ports.Overall, I'm glad I purchased the 720P. It is fast, lasts all day and does everything I need. Highly recommended!!UPDATE: After 2 weeks of use, all I can say is \"Fantastic\"... runs all day long, fast, touch is great, no lag with heavy use. No issues with camera, touch screen... again, just wish the SD slot was a full size. Other point I'd make is this does not have a VGA port like the 720C so hooking up to TV/Monitor is only with HDMI. None of my monitors support HDMI, but it works great on the TV and no issues with Chromecast.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value proposition!", "Author": "F. J.

Battery life is absolutely fantastic! There are plenty of apps out there to meet my needs. Bluetooth and Wifi radios seem very robust. Keyboard and touchpad are more than adequate.

It showed me that I could be productive, but the performance left a lot to be desired.  Video's stuttered, sometimes network performance was slow and on occasion it would lock up for a few minutes.  Fast forward to this little gem...The ACER's screen is about the same size as the Samsung's 12\" screen, the color of the Samsung is warmer and better, and the keyboard keys of the Samsung feel firmer and make for a better typing experience but that's where its advantages end.  The Acer is faster, shows youtube 1440HD video without stuttering, I can open as many tabs as I need, and although I WANT the 4GB of memory, from the earlier Acer, I am really not missing/noticing the any performance lapse because of the reduced memory.  As a matter of fact the ACER outperforms the Samsung on every level except the afore mentioned keyboard/screen quality.The acer has Bluetooth, USB 3.0, SD card slot AND 32GB SSD, and a touch screen. I thought the touch screen was a bit gimmicky initially but after you find a few Google Apps that use it you see that the touch screen has real value.  Most notably apps like \"Cut the Rope\" where getting the right motion/timing is important.  Its so useful that when I use my Samsung again I find I miss not having the touch screen for scrolling through pictures, and opening apps, etc...Microsoft really, really needs to be nervous about Google, and its Chromebooks, especially now that some of the apps like Google Docs and games like Cut the Rope, can be used without a network.  Add the bonus of 2 years of 100GB of storage ($120), 10 gogo passes ($100+) and one extra month of google music ($10), and the hardware is pretty much free.  Also Google continues to update the OS.  My older Samsung is at the same software revision as the Acer C720P.  On the Samsung I would notice a slowness with the computer when the updates were downloading, on the Acer I notice no such slowness.  As a matter of fact when I see the update sign at the bottom of the screen, I stop what I am doing and reboot so that I can see the new, sometimes subtle goodies/features from Google.  This beats the pants off of a MS update, which while automatic will reboot my pc with a 15 minute warning, whether I am ready or not.

I'll mention a few pros and cons:PROS:- Starts up in seconds... like, maybe five seconds.- Keyboard has a good feel.- Maintains its speed even with multiple tabs open.- Outstanding battery life. Unless I'm streaming video, I regularly get more than the 7.5 hours they claim. For non-video web browsing or when working on a document I'd estimate I average more than 9 hours between charges.- Charges full in very little time. Also, it charges pretty quickly even when you're charging while watching video online.CONS: (Some of these will sound like nitpicking, I realize, but still...)- No backlit keys. Until you know the keyboard layout and have learned shortcut key combinations, having backlit keys would be a major plus.- Limited viewing angles. You really have to adjust either the display angle or your body position to get a clean image.- Huge amounts of glare when used in an area where the light is behind you. I assume this is a function of the material used for the touch screen.- Touchpad occasionally goes unresponsive for vertical scrolling or for moving the pointer / cursor. (This is where having the touchscreen pays off, because the screen is reliably responsive to finger gestures for swiping, scrolling, and clicking check boxes. I've found that the touchpad works again if you just shut down and re-start the computer, but it's a bit annoying.) The touchpad occasionally gets a bit balky when using the computer while charging it.- No delete or page up / page down keys. (Minor quibbles. See comment below.)Comment: Google provides a nice summary of keyboard shortcuts in their Chromebook help pages at [google chromebook support page...I guess I can't post a link in a review]. Strongly recommended for those who want to maximize their efficiency with a Chromebook and for those who (like me) miss having stuff like the Delete, Caps Lock and page up/down keys. Probably the most useful of the shortcuts is the CTL+ALT+? combination, which pops up a full screen keyboard that shows just about every shortcut. It would be nice if they similarly provided a more thorough guide to all the features on the Chromebook, such as the camera, which I still haven't figured out. I probably haven't looked hard enough, though.Overall, I've found this Acer touchscreen Chromebook to be extremely useful and I'm happy I got it. It's light, compact, solidly built, and pretty much lives up to the excellent reviews I've seen.

I was blown away at the responsiveness since my expectations were set pretty low considering the price tag. The battery life is pretty amazing too and it powers on in only a few seconds. I can connect it to the hotspot on my phone and work while taking the train home from work. I am very surprised at the speaker quality - I was using a Toshiba Satellite before and the built in speakers were garbage. I'm can also pair this Chromebook to my Bluetooth headphones. Finally, I also really like the slimness and the overall design and color of the C720P (it has the clean stormtrooper feel to it).What I dislike:I consider myself a bit out of the norm, but I usually have quite a few tabs open at a given time (this is because of the line of work I'm in). After having about a 15 tabs open, I notice some stuttering. This is very noticeable when I'm playing music. This is primarily due to my own web browsing habits as I have a problem not closing tabs when I no longer need them. It would, however, be nice if the RAM was 4gb instead of 2gb.Who I'd recommend to:I'd recommend this to anyone who spends the majority of their time on a computer in a web browser. I'd also recommend it to your general student in high school or college, assuming you're not required to use an application that isn't supported by Chrome.Keep in mind, if you don't have an internet connection, the Chromebook isn't super useful.

I wanted something I could type on so I could respond to emails. work on spreadsheets, etc and those devices just didn't cut it. I just hate the pop-up keyboards on the tablets. I had visited many electronics retailers and checked out the Sony, Microsoft Surface Pro, and a few others. I had been set to purchase one through Amazon on Cyber Monday and then I saw the Acer 720P come up. No, it hadn't been released and they weren't sure of the release date at the time, but I am so glad I waited for it. I read the reviews of its predecessors, the 710 and 720 and they were positive.

The finish is not in the heights of premium ultraportable devices, however it feels all right and does not have any obvious structural weaknesses. The 7.5 hours battery life is amazing compared to my main machine, that only has 2-3 hours of capacity. The machine turns on and switches to standby mode nearly instantly. The selection of connectors is good too, attaching an external monitor to the HDMI port turns on the screen extension instantly and without issues.The keyboard feels fine it has no backlighting but I don't think it would be a common addition in the Chromebook lineup. A challenging aspect of using the keyboard is that certain keys available on full size keyboards are missing. There is no [delete] [home] [end] [pgup] or [pgdown] key, however their function can be emulated by key combinations. The list of key combinations can be recalled by [ctrl] + [alt] + [/].The touchscreen feels nice and is an outstanding addition to the usual controls. It may seem as a gimmick at first, however it provides a perfect substitute for a mouse without the awkwardness of touchpads. It has some additional features like scrolling and gesture recognition for pinch zooming or back and forth page flipping in the Chrome browser. The touchscreen feels natural for smartphone users, and navigation and zooming are smoothly animated. Some extra features from smartphones for selection copying and pasting are also included.I have mainly used the machine for web browsing, document editing with the google tools (that work offline as well) and reading pdf documents. During this time I have not observed any performance problems, the experience is perfectly smooth. Due to the nature of my use I have not run into limitations of the Chrome OS the device comes installed with. Some changes to the selection of the used tools renders the platform perfectly usable for everyday use, however in case additional needs would need to be met there is a relatively easy solution to unleash the full power of the machine.As ChromeOS is essentially Linux with a custom user interface it is possible to install a usual desktop, such as Ubuntu's Unity side by side with the original interface. The tool called Crouton takes care of all the difficulties that this operation might imply, and sets up the chosen desktop environment almost fully automatically. After the installation is complete it can be launched from a browser based shell environment, and while running switching back and forth between the Chrome and the other (e.g. Unity) interface is done via keyboard shortcuts and is nearly instant. From the alternative Linux desktop the installation of PC programs runs as usual. Due to the additional features available by this means the device poses a viable alternative to more expensive dual Android / Windows systems for people that need some additional flexibility in case the default mobile OS has some deal braking limitations.Having used the device with a tethered internet connection from my smartphone - due to its lightweight design long battery life, performance, and flexibility it seems like an ideal second laptop for road use, that keeps you productive while on the go.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Pretty darn killer!!", "Author": "Mike in CT", "ReviewID": "R1W20ZM14TQDC8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a few reservations before buying this chromebook.

I personally have a MacBook Pro because I'm a bit of a build quality snob. I used to stick with the Lenovo ThinkPads until their last model left be a bit wanting and I jumped ship. I hate using and carrying around laptops that feel like they will completely shatter if dropped or knocked off of something.I would compare the Samsung one to a kind of plastic knockoff that is super flimsy and made to a price that is much lower than what you're paying.

The screen would sway and the keyboard would mush in when you typed on it, and the trackpad was a unsensitive mess.This Chromebook however is a solid machine, which while it is plastic, feels as solid as my MacBook in day to day use. I must say this really surprised me. The hinges are solid, the keyboard is well-supported and very clicky, and the track pad is perfect. The touch screen is also very well done. I will be looking at Acer laptops when I'm in the market in the future.The only downside that I've noticed, and other reviewers have mentioned, is that the color temperature of the LCD screen is a little...off. However, since he's not doing any kind of color sensitive work, and we only noticed it when we placed it next to another monitor, it's not that noticeable.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Connor", "ReviewID": "R2HOOBOG3TPJRM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this today, so I will update this review later on as I use it more. But...so far so good! I gave my Samsung Series 3 Chromebook to my parents and picked this one up, and I noticed that the build quality feels a little better with the C720P. I always had the issue of having the keyboard and trackpad bending when I used the Series 3 on my lap--not with the C720P. I've tried loading ~15 or so tabs on this, and I haven't noticed any lag or tab reloading, which was very obvious on the Series 3. I saw reviews saying this screen is terrible, but it is fine for what it is. You can't expect this to have a retina screen for its price. The viewing angles are good, better than the Series 3 (I can't really say if the viewing angles were worse because of the matte screen). The speakers are underpowered, but I wouldn't really want to listen to music from them anyways. I like the keyboard on the C720P, but I haven't decided on whether I liked the it or the keyboard on the Series 3. The trackpad is very smooth and responsive (not sure if this glass like my MacBook Pro's trackpad, if anyone knows, please leave a comment).Now the main reason why I chose the C720P over the C720 with 4 gb RAM was because of the touchscreen. I was kind of expecting a screen that was somewhat responsive, but I was mistaken. It's accurate and responsive, though it is kind of hard to press really small buttons on the screen (but that's what your cursor is for). As I use it more, I'm sure the touch will become more natural to me. I was kind of disappointed that I couldn't use touch to make a drawing on Google Drive. Since Chromebooks are meant to be so ingrained with Google's other products, I was expecting the touch to have more functionality. But I won't detract any stars from that since it's minor and I wasn't looking for that feature specifically.All in all, I would definitely recommend this to others who are in the market for a portable laptop or are looking for a new toy to play with. I think this is probably the best Chromebook you can buy at the moment, though the touchscreen option is more expensive. If not the C720P, then I think the C720 would be just as great.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "chromebook 720P", "Author": "Richard G.

The earlier chromebooks were not too fast and not too good, but this one is excellent in terms of speed to boot up and operate.  As most of her browsing is done using google anyway and her email is google,  this is a no brainer for her with no learning curve.  Only drawback is creating documents that can be read in other systems.  Her google docs don't open in windows for example.  I guess you can go to googles website to open a document that way, but seems like a burden to have to do that.  The device itself is very good for the money. Sticky backspace key, but not bad.  I would recommend it as a low cost system for home use.  very lightweight and touch screen capable... the only other chrome book that does this is 1000 bucks more !!", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great internet machine with Apps", "Author": "BOGY.", "ReviewID": "RFX41P5MZ30TS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Up front here is what you get - an internet machine that has 2GB of RAM (which can't be upgraded) and 32GB of on board SSD storage with a nice 11.6\" touch screen display and about 7 hours of battery life.Touchscreen & Display (11.6\")The touchscreen works very well.  I never thought I would need a touchscreen but find myself scrolling and opening pictures with it.  The touch is very responsive and works great.  The display is quite nice and colors show nicely and are not an issue.  There is a bit of a glare in certain situations but it is only with viewing angles that it becomes an issue.  Overall the display will please you.RAMThis unit comes with 2GB - I wanted 4GB but this touchscreen model does not come with it.  The RAM is embedded into the motherboard so it can't be upgraded.  Overall the performance is good even with multiple windows open surfing the internet runs smooth.  Occasionally a picture/flash heavy sight will take a moment to load but otherwise internet surfers will love this device.ProcessorThe Haswell architecture has really done well for this device. Pair this with the SSD drive and start up boot time is less than 5 seconds and power down is just seconds as well.  Updates are done automatically so you won't even know when it is happening.  The device opens apps and video quickly and smoothly - just in general this device does not have any issues with processor lag.StorageYou get 32 GB of SSD on board.  You CAN upgrade this to 128GB.  You would need a few things but it can be done easily but will cost you about $100.  You would need to purchase the 128GB SSD card here on Amazon.  Then , if you have a 4GB USB drive you can create a restore point on it, power down, install the new 128 card, power up with the USB drive in the USB slot and boot from there - the rest will update.  Google Drive offers two years of free 100GB storage but I am not going there as you have to pay after two years.I purchased a Patriot mini USB storage device the size of a dime and plugged it in the 2.0 USB slot for an additional 32GB storage.  If needed I can remove the USB drive and transfer the files to a larger drive ....if needed later on.PortsYou have on the left side a 3.0 USB, HDMI, headphone and power jack.  On the right a 2.0 USB, SD card reader and if you want to lock the device there is a lock hole.  The power cord is unique to the Chromebook and not USB.  Wifi is your main connectivity as there is no Ethernet jack.  However, the Chromebook has full Bluetooth capability and can pair with your devices.Keyboard and track padHere things get a little tricky and you will need to read up online and get your grove on.  This is a bit different than your typical laptop keyboard and track pad.  There are no numbers on the right side or Alt buttons and the keys are individual and raised. The keys are not illuminated.  There are NO left or right click buttons.  The entire track pad is a button.  So, click with one finger and you left click.  Click with TWO fingers you you right click.  Takes some getting used to especially for copy and paste which can be challenging to some.APPSGoogle Play is on board and has a full variety of apps to use - I like it a lot and there are not many limitations - many of the apps you might have on your Android phone can also be on your Chromebook.  Apps like Hangouts, Youtube, Chromecast, etc will all work fine and integrate nicely with the Chromebook.BatteryVery happy at this point as the device is new - time will tell how the battery holds up.  I can surf the internet for hours - about 7 hours at this point and be fine.  Most of the time I am on for only about two hours so battery life is not an issue.Size and weightThe Chrome book is small and light - the display is only 11.6\" but you can still see everything nicely and adjust the font size which I did to Large or extra large if need be.  It is very light between 2.5 - 3 lbs you can hardly feel it on your lap.  It does not get hot and is completely quiet - noise free however there is a fan inside.WEB CAMThere is an HD webcam that works ok in well lit rooms.  In darker lit areas it will be difficult to capture a good image.  Hangouts is what you will use it for most and it works great.  I am not sure if this will work with Skype or if that app is available in the store. Also the camera is front facing - there is no rear facing camera which is fine and how most laptops are set up compared to tablets.PRICEI got this Chromebook primarily for my wife as an internet surfer.  For the price, $309 shipped it isn't terrible.  I would have liked the 4GB of RAM non-touch screen model but that is like finding a unicorn these days.  Although that device only has 16GB SSD storage at least you can upgrade the storage on the Chromebooks where as the RAM is untouchable.ThoughtsI think this device is capable of a lot of things.  Internet and Google will be your primary use for this device.  If you are looking to do word processing and spreadsheets and graphical design this is not your device.  It can do these things with limitations but this is not it's purpose.  Also, even for a young technically savvy person you will need to learn and figure things out such as the track pad and the OS (Operating System) and how it works.  Overall - I am very happy with the Chromebook and love ACER in general.  I have had many of their computers and laptops.

I can't testify yet to the computer's quality after a year or so, however, the price is certainly worth the purchase!

I came to the realization that I wanted something that had a touch screen for the instances where I would need one (i.e. games, or apps that are designed for touch screen).

It response rather fast and works well for what it is.There are people reviewing this computer saying \"is the touch screen worth the extra $100 than the non touch version of this computer (C720)\"  they seem to miss that the C720 has a smaller solid state hard drive at ~16 GH where as this one the C720P has a 32 GB solid state hard drive.  Solid state hard drives are rather expensive I would say just that bump would bring the price of the 16 GB one up about $50 so the touch screen addition is merely another $50 that is actually not bad to have the ability to use a touch screen in a $300 machine, not sure where else you would find this much power and accessibility in any other laptop.The screen is pretty nice too.

Most of our products have been based on Microsoft operating systems. I also have experience with the Intel Macintosh and a number of different tablets including Android, Windows 7, Windows 8 pro, Windows 8.1 pro and two Asus RT 8.0 systems. When I first heard of Google's efforts to produce a cloud based laptop, which was essentially the Google browser, I scoffed. Chromebooks did not make sense, particularly given the insanely high cost of the initial Chromebooks.After watching the Samsung Chromebook remain at the top of the list of best-selling Amazon laptops for many months, I decided to pick one up and give it a try. I can't say at first that I was blown away, but I could definitely see the potential offered by inexpensive systems with minimal exposure to malware and stealthy updates which almost never delay access to the system or introduce unwanted glitches. The more I used my Samsung the more I began to depend upon it for day to day tasks such as answering emails, modifying contracts, testing and managing our websites, web searches and entertainment.I began to fantasize about an affordable Chromebook with touchscreen access. When Acer announced the availability of the 720P Chromebook replete with touchscreen, I bit the bullet and ordered. I was able to order from Amazon using my prime account and expected delivery within two days. However, it seems that my order was passed off from UPS to the postal service and it arrived a day late. To Amazon's credit, I received an email apology and credit of $10.00 to my account because of the delay in delivery.The external package tape was broken as if dropped, but the device seems fine (this kind of external package damage is a first for me with Amazon electronics.) Two things immediately caught my attention when I opened the Chromebook box ... (1) the increased weight and bulk compared to my Samsung and (2) the extra-large power supply with heavy-duty power lines and cable running to the computer. As I charged the device, I could feel some heat on my thigh next to the laptop power socket. Perhaps, the saving grace is that it seems to fully charge within an hour or so. Heat on the bottom of the unit is considerably less noticeable when running on battery alone.The screen is bright and touch seems to work well. I noticed touch zoom was added to many more websites after a background upgrade. The keyboard, for this hunt and peck user, is good and better than the Samsung Chromebook. The audio is the best of any of my portable devices. Loud without distortion and enough bass to allow for me listen for extended periods. The Samsung is thinner and lighter and I will miss that, but the Acer machine feels more substantial and not uncomfortably thick or heavy.I can't emphasize enough how nice it is to log on, enter your Google account and have everything running in minutes! Chrome OS is limited and this may change as it matures but this instant on and install is addictive. It shames all other OSs. We shall see if Chrome OS can grow and stay as user-friendly. I think I spent all of two minutes booting and logging in before I had a machine with most of my settings and apps intact and installed!One major disappointment. I frequently use LG (700 and 730) Bluetooth headsets to listen to streamed music from my Amazon and Xbox music accounts. I have encountered frequent problems with Bluetooth streamed audio when using Windows 8 tablets and Windows RT tablets after upgrading to either 8.1 or subsequent Microsoft / OEM system updates. I have no problems at all using Bluetooth headsets with the Samsung Chromebook. However, if I'm any significant distance away from the Wi-Fi router when using the 720P audio may skip or pause and Netflix videos will repeatedly pause at least every 30 seconds. If I am closer to the router, Bluetooth and Netflix seem to work fine. I see this issue even when I have three bars in the Wi-Fi signal strength icon. Importantly, while in the exactly same distant location, I was able to watch Netflix video and listen to the same audio using the Samsung Chromebook paired with my LG Bluetooth headsets without issue.Bluetooth is not exactly a new standard and I am dismayed at the difficulties manufacturers and software developers have in producing portable devices that can take advantage of streamed audio without hiccups or pauses! Inevitably, Microsoft seems to first give and then later take away reliable streamed Bluetooth audio in many of its portable devices. I had hoped that I would fare better with Chrome OS devices. Apparently, consistently supporting quality Bluetooth audio is beyond the skill set of Chipset, Google and Microsoft engineers.I plan to continue to experiment with my Bluetooth Devices and media streamed to my Chromecast dongle. If issues with Netflix paired with Bluetooth audio persist, I suspect I will return the Acer. Perhaps I am odd man out in expecting portable device manufacturers to deliver systems fully supporting quality Bluetooth audio streaming.Update: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi seem to interact when using Intel based devices. I raised my Linksys router about four feet above the desk by mounting on a microphone stand and can use the Acer 720P to stream Netflix and XBox music with less re-buffering and pauses. That said, I still experience no issues raised or not when using the Samsung Chromebook in the same location.The more I use the 720P the more I appreciate the touchscreen. I no longer use my beloved Asus Windows RT tablet much. It still serves its original purpose of testing our websites and checking email, but the almost constant nagging to \"update\" to RT 8.1 has becoming tiresome. Win RT 8.1 kills BT audio and the built-in camera flash and we will not install 8.1 until absolutely forced to.I mentioned the improved touch pinch to contract and zoom in my initial comments. This update makes the touchscreen far more attractive. I just updated my Win RT 8 tablet two times. Each update put the tablet out of service for at least 20 minutes. Currently, Chromebook devices update without any noticeable interruption and is a huge bonus. Would be interesting to see how many hours, weeks or months are lost when updating Windows machines.Streaming from Chrome tabs seems to work well enough for a show and tell, but the color on my Vizio TV with Chromecast is nothing to write home about. It was disappointing when I discovered video play back from internally stored files cannot be Chromecast. Using Chromecast takes a noticeable toll on battery life.UPDATE 2: Microsoft has released direct links to online Office Word, Excel and One Note. Office links can be found in the Chrome store. Having the icons and links in your Chrome Apps pop up menu makes it easier to use online Office Apps. Unfortunately, Save downloads the file to your Chromebook memory rather than One Drive or Google Drive. I drag the file to Google Drive and delete from the Chromebook. A bit of a pain.Battery life seems to be significantly better than what I get when using the Samsung but, no formal comparisons have been made. Even with Wi-Fi / Bluetooth issues, the long battery life and touchscreen makes this a keeper.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Like it but key came off after less than two months...", "Author": "Philip Leeman", "ReviewID": "R1QE7Q4I5UMMNN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Overall, we like the Chrome OS experience and grateful for the reduced price compared to other OS, but after less than two months, a key already came off the key board for no reason.

I did not desire to replace or substitute my work laptop and did not need to use the Chromebook with Office or other software.  A lot of people are comparing the Chromebook to a full-blown laptop.  It's not.  I knew that when I started in my quest to find something smaller than my 18\" Vaio I use for work.  If you're looking for a power machine, stop here. I'm not the expert--just an Amazon user--go do your research on what the Chromebook can and cannot do to first see if it meets your needs. My friends couldn't believe I was buying a simple machine but again, the Chromebook was exactly what I needed for laying on the couch and vegging out!I went to the local big retailer and they had 3 models.  I decided the Chromebook would meet my needs but I wasn't impressed with what I found in the store.  I looked on the Google site and read several reviews online.  I debated the other models and I can tell you this is by far the best Chromebook I saw in store and online.  The touch screen alone puts it far above its competitors.  Even my brother--a Desktop Help provider at a school district--was taken aback by how user-friendly it was.  I don't use the touch screen for every click or scroll, but it makes using the Chromebook a freaking fantastic experience.  This one aspect alone is enough to choose the C720P over the other options.Again, since this is a Chromebook and they are basically identical, I can tell you other things particular to this model that please me.  One such is battery life.  It can go a LONG time without charging.  It lives up to the long battery life it promises.  All Chromebooks are easy to use but the start-up and shutdown time are also pretty phenomenal.  Life is easier for users if you are familiar with Google Apps and have a Google account, although this certainly isn't required.  It was nice to sign in and have everything--including my Drive (my leisurely writing example)--all available.  And, I can edit those documents from any other computer.  I stream Amazon Instant video, watch YouTube all the time, and have counted more than 10 tabs open at once without any loss of speed.I'd say if you've determined a Chromebook meets your individual needs, buy this one.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "As good as advertised", "Author": "jaru22 \"Jaru22\"", "ReviewID": "R16PT8DFLUH8KC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A perfect notebook for casual use.

I have the c720p and every Chromebook review I read said \"make sure you get the 4Gb version\". That to is completely wrong! The c720 series from Acer has an intel processor meaning it is an x86 based system as apposed to the arm based systems that most other Chromebooks use; I do not know why exactly but the x86 based chromebooks seem to run much faster even when they only have 2Gb of ram. While weriting this I have 8 tabs open in Chrome: Gmail, Google+, Google play music (playing music), Google Drive, Amazon (obviously), as well as two others and there is not even so much as a hint of lag.  I got the Moonstone White version and it looks amazing. I have no complaints about the look  or the feel of this machine. Build quality is great, yes it is plastic but does not look or feel cheap.  Boot time is blazing fast. From off to Google log-in in under 5 seconds. The Battery lasts very close to the 6 hours Acer claims. Even with some heavy use, like Play music and some YouTube the c720(p) will last you all day with out a problem.  So I gave this 5 stars and I do highly recommend it for anyone looking for a killer Chromebook. That said, I do have one complaint; the charger is a more traditional notebook charger/ power supply and the pin end that plugs into your c720 is tinny. If anyone owned an Acer Iconia A500 you will know exactly what I mean. The pin is small enough that if your not careful you can easily bend/break it. That is the only bad thing I can say about the Acer c720(p).

Once I jumped through the hoops to get Ubuntu on this machine there were a few problems which I managed to find solutions for on the web.  Before I continue I'll mention that yes the touch screen works in Ubunutu.The first real problem I ran into was with the Atheros wireless card.  It would connect to an access point, but then simply drop connections silently while still reporting it was connected.  This turned out to be it simply not playing nice with the 2Wire modem/access point I was using.  Connecting to my Apple Timecapsule created a stable connection.  No further tweaking was required.The second problem is neither the touchpad nor the touchscreen work right off in Ubuntu.  You're going to need a USB mouse or be comfortable tabbing through options on the keyboard.  Once you have Ubuntu up getting both working is simple.  Just search for \"ubuntu c720p touch screen\"  The first option is an article linking you to another article with a script to download.  You don't need to do step one in the second article since you're already using Ubuntu at this point.  Just go to step two and download and run the script.  It'll download some necessary packages to get everything working.  Both worked flawlessly after the reboot.The third and possibly most annoying problem is it will hang after going to sleep.  Go ahead close the lid and open it again.  It's not coming back.  It's related to a crash that happens with the sound service when it tries to sleep.  To find the fix just google for \"ubuntu c720p Pedro Larroy\"  If you do what the initial post says it will stop the hang, but leave you with a crashed service.  Try hitting ctrl+alt+F1 and watch all the EHCI errors.  Instead scroll down to Mike Lim's comment beginning with \"(Updated 12/11)\" and follow those instructions.  After that my machine woke up fine and no longer threw a ton of EHCI errors.  Oh and audio continued to work.After all that the device works great so far.

It is otherwise the same as the C720P-2666)With my Lenovo laptop, purchased at Circuit City on the last business day, becoming increasingly fragile, I'd been keeping an eye on the Chromebook hardware for the past 8 months. There were lots of models but none had a price/performance profile that I found compelling enough to buy. The Acer C720p-2625, with 4 GB of RAM, a speedy, low power processor that provides over 6 hours of use between charges, HDMI and USB 3.0 and a touchscreen at about $330 (on MacMall - Amazon is not stocking this specific model at them moment) can't be beat. I'm lazy when it comes to closing tabs. With 4GB of RAM (2GB more than most of the other C720 models) handles 20 or 30 open tabs with ease. The keyboard, although the key depth is small, is nonetheless quite responsive. Battery life has lived up to published spec. The speakers are reasonably good given the price.On top of the great hardware, which I expected, was the Chrome OS itself which, to my surprise, is far better than I expected. It is well organized, polished and remarkably feature rich. Google has done an absolutely outstanding job coming up with an interface that succeeds where the netbooks of several years ago failed. If you still have a traditional Windows laptop/desktop around, the Chrome Remote Desktop add on let's you access it effortlessly and securely from the Chromebook.

I'm not sure how much I'll use the touch screen, but it's a nice option.My one nit pick is that they changed the AC adapter to be two separate pieces (the cord that goes from the adapter to the wall, and the adapter/cord that goes into the unit) instead of one piece.

I wasn't expecting much and if it becomes obsolete soon, well, I didn't spend much either.But I am thrilled with this little device.

I read all these \"pro\" reviews that talk about Chrome not being an ideal OS for a touchscreen. Well, I have news for them, I don't spend a lot of time staring at the OS screen, I'm on the internet using & looking at all the same screens I use from my OS 8 laptop & my tablets. I have a non-touchscreen HP Chromebook 11 which is also nice but not having a touchscreen on it is frustrating 'cause it is hard to zoom in & out as needed. This thing is great & is so much faster at loading pages than any of my laptops or my iPad Air (also frustrating w/o a touchscreen but otherwise great). Still this is the best money I've ever spent on a small laptop. Keyboard is the weak point & screen colors aren't as nice as the IPS display on the HP 11' Chromebook but overall it is a much faster & easier Chromebook to use due to the touchscreen.  Wish it had 4MB of memory, but I'm sure that's coming.Update - I've had this for a few weeks now & I'm having keyboard problems that come & go. Some of the time several keys on the row with the qwerty keys stop working.  It has gotten so bad that I've now updated my C720 with an on-screen keyboard so when this happens, especially signing on, I can do so w/o having to install an external keyboard. It is very frustrating & having read several blogs, I found I'm not the only person having this issue.  I still love having a touch-screen, but if I were to recommend a chromebook to someone now, I'd recommend the new Dell Chromebook 11 - no touchscreen, but according to a majority of the reviews I've read, it is the best all around chromebook available right now. As a result of the keyboard issues, I've lowered my rating from 5 to just 3 stars. As a result of the problem, I looked around & got a great deal on the Chromebook Pixel for about 1/2 price & it is every bit as good as advertised. Best screen on any PC I've ever seen & yes it is a touchscreen too.Update May 2014 - Well, my impressions of this laptop have again returned to a much more positive level as a result of the fact that after several recent software updates of the Chrome OS, my physical keyboard issues had seemingly disappeared.why, I don't know. It just hasn't reared it's ugly head in several weeks. Fingers crossed. Now comparing this Chromebook with the HP Chromebook 11 has made me realize that despite the better screen and much more attractive look of the HP, this Acer is a much more powerful & capable internet device than the HP. I now find trying to do much of anything on the HP with more than a couple of tabs open, very frustrating. I will also compare this Acer with the Chromebook Pixel, Believe it or not the Acer compares pretty well against my Pixel in a functional sense. By far the largest difference between the two is the quality of the screens. The Pixel has the best screen I've ever seen & the c720p screen is just OK. But honestly I do not notice a huge difference in speed when using either online. I'm sure the Pixel with a faster processor & 4GB of memory can handle a lot more open tabs than the Acer, but at the same time I find the Pixel a little frustrating to use because of how fast the battery drains compared to the c720p. The Acer gets about 3 hours more use when watching movies or TV shows. So even though every single physical thing about the Pixel is better on it than the Acer (screen,keyboard, touchpad, case, etc), due to the much better battery life, I tend to grab the c720 when I'm away from a wall plug for extended periods. I do prefer using the Pixel to any other laptop or computer I've ever owned, when plugged in but I honestly prefer the Acer when out & about. I love that it too has a touchscreen & I've replaced the 32gb SSD with a 128gb card & put all my music, movies, & e-books on it so now even off-line I have things I can do. I am very happy now with this chromebook & wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

I really like the Google app called \"X New Tab Page\" to customize my home screen, making all my favorite apps, extensions, web pages etc easy to find and re-arrange (you can even upload your own images to the icon buttons) -- before I found it I was frustrated with trying to remember how to access this or that function, now they're all in one place and easy to find.

Take decent ultra book, and strip it the OS down to one basic function and that is a chrome web browser.

The touch screen was decent and responsive. Games like \"Cut the Rope\" and \"Where is my water\" work just as well as if I was playing on my tablet. The track pad was decent. Not as great as a Mac Book but still good. Only thing that I would comment is that Chrome OS doesn't really take full advantage of the touch interface. Battery was good and last a whole day, considering all you are doing is web-base activity. Screen resolution is not a super sharp but its bright and viewing angle are good. Videos turn out as well as youtube can produce and the speakers were good.I didn't really do much offline activity so I could not really rate it. Wifi connection is a must which might be down side since this very internet dependent. But what PC/Mac or tablet isn't internet dependent.Overall this is a good device for it's intended purpose. Simple set up and easy to learn. The price is the real selling point of these kind of devices and like I said you get what you paid for.NOTE: Gmail/Google account is a must, as CHROME OS was made for the Google ecosystem.For the bold and daring: you can install Crouton and it works well even with the touch screen (with some minor programing). Crouton is a program that allows you to run Chrome OS and Ubuntu at same time. With a simple keystroke you can switch back and forth with easy. Ubuntu is a full OS based on Linux and it's a good to expand chrome book use like adding a office suite like Libre or Open office and other programs like VLC player. Down side is that 2GB of Ram and 32GB of storage may not be ideal if you going to do more with Ubuntu.Update: I did end return this to Amazon a week later only because Dell Inspiron 3137 went on sale for the same price of $299 (during the holidays).", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this Chromebook", "Author": "Dh135", "ReviewID": "R37L5B17W75IOZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Acer nailed it with this Chromebook.

I decided to use the HDMI port to plug it into my 36 inch Sony tv.  It works great and drives the bigger picture perfectly.  Once the tv is active, you can close the Chromebook and just use the tv and usb keyboard and mouse in docked mode.  Essentially, there is only one software program and that is the Chrome browser.  All the Apps from the app store run on that and there is no lengthy download or updating of them.  They load and run instantly.  Because this computer is not running a bunch of software at one time, it is quite fast - even at 2GB.  Online videos, tv and the likes of Netflix run great.  If you are looking for a bunch of specialty software, this is not for you.  It did print to my wireless printer from the cloud, but it was a little tricky getting it going and there is a delay. It only prints from the cloud to an Internet connected printer.  The online Google Docs word processer and the spreadsheet are quite adequate for my simple uses.  Bookmarks from my other Chrome browser went right to my Chromebook browser, which is great.  I don't believe it will recognize a usb DVD drive, and I don't know if a portable hard drive will work either.  But a USB Flash drive will work and I transferred a bunch of files from a SD card.  WIFI always works well from my router.  Haven't tried it outside my home.It takes a little getting used to after Windows or MAC computers,  But the best thing about it is the speed.  Google's cloud storage is fine, and you can always plug in flash drives.  Essentially, I'm using it as a desktop (attached keyboard, mouse and tv monitor) and to be honest I haven't even used the touchscreen.  It sure beats the heck out of my slow old Dell and I can always count on it booting up in a couple of seconds.  Realy, the online TV and videos work better than my larger Sony Google TV.

Once you make the mental leap to doing everything online you will see why a chromebook is amazing. Superfast without expensive hardware.

I hated waiting for a long update every other time I started up my pc. You open the cover of a chromebook and go! My other computers eventually get so cluttered that they slow down to the point that I want to scream. The chromebook does not really get loaded up so this will not be a problem. And you can \"scrub\" the thing and start over if you want. \"But what about backing up my data first?\" No need, it's in the cloud. \"Now I will have to spend an entire day reloading all my software.\" No need, there is no software. No spinning hard drive to heat up your laptop and kill your battery. The battery life of this chromebook is super long. The solid state drive and RAM are small but there is no need for them to be big - everything is done on the web and it has more than enough space and power to open up 10 tabs in the browser. It plays music well, the video streaming from youtube and netflix is smooth, the screen is not super bright but it is not bad either. Connect it to your TV with an HDMI cable and get stunning 1080 streamed video. It has a matte finish so glare is not a problem. It's also small and very light. To print you will need a cloud printer or be in a home with any regular computer that is connected to a regular printer. You will just need to turn on cloud print in chrome on the regular computer, it's simple. It has USB and SD connections so you can play music or videos locally if needed. You can copy files from a flash drive onto the chromebook drive or google drive.If you have applications that need to be loaded onto a computer hard drive then a chromebook will not work for you. If you want to use it in places were there is no wi-fi it is also not a good choice as it's offline use it pretty limited.

Vast majority of mainstream casual Internet crowd will no doubt view me this way but before writing me off, I'm just like you! Originally a googler user on a Netscape browsers since 1996! Google continues to push innovation year after year, Chromebooks are no exception. One of the goals they had with Chromebook was connecting the lower class to the Web.To do this they engineered a Browser like OS(chromeOS). A software with low resource requirements in keeping prices down. In the past getting online means buying $600laptop  but mid 2011 google changed that with Chromebook @ $200!before all that ,the tech companies tried this as well! The industry created a new category called \"netbooks\" laptops 2007. Cheap but slow, a deal breaker! WHY? because the technology wasn't there yet.  Thus, we the consumer market correlated the terms NETBOOKS CHEAP Laptops = unusable SLOW.  LOL  Chromebooks changed all that a few years ago. Finally a cheap but fast machine at a fraction of a price are now at the hands of the budget conscious buyers. Is it a full working laptop? Definitely not. But it's perfectly fine for people needing to browse the internets... at least for now.Then another \"cause and effect\" shift in innovation occurred in the industry.  \"Cause\" > MOBILE devices boom, \"EFFECT\" > Faster Tech evolution.INTEL & AMD's new SoC and APU chips. To the novice readers, those two companies are the brain power of the industry.  AND the latest shift in innovation occurred late (October) 2013, higher level of processing power paved way reengineered \"Netbooks\"* to match Chromebooks affordability but offering users usability a full functionality of Windows OS and not just a Browser backboned OS(ChromeOS). The Technology finally caught up.11-14\" Touch Laptops w/ advanced SoC/APU based notebooks from various OEM are bringing back \"NETBOOK\" category to life. These was what Asus EeePC shoud have been in 2008.  But unfortunately, our frustrating experience of NETBOOKS in years past is hard to forget, the damage has already been done.  Unless you're curious enough to give it another go...and i did.Honestly I didn't expect much but I was shocked.  All i can say is you dont need$700 to have a fast windows... its possible on a $380 and bonus its a touch screen notebook!. +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++==Alternative Options==I was doing my research i found these (for the EQUAL PRICE),  Spent many hours creating this list for my own buying guide but decided to keep updating it, pls thumbs up. thanks==TOP 5 Cheap ($280-$399) TOUCH NOTEBOOKS==Typically between 11.6\" to under 14\" touchscreens, 3.7-2.6 lbs or below in weight.This is for buyers looking for functional, portable, light weight, bang for your buck notebooks thats not only good enough for web browsing (except rank No.5)NO.1  +/- $335 HP Pavilion 11-e015nr TouchSmart 11.6\" Touch Screen - AMD Elite Quad-Core A6-1450(06/01/2013) / 4GB DDR3 / 320GB HD / Windows 8 64-bit OSOR from a different seller here...HP Pavilion TouchSmart 11-e015nr 12-Inch Touch Screen Laptop Notebook (1.0 GHz up to 1.4GHz AMD Elite Mobility Quad-Core A6-1450 Accelerated Processor, 4GB DDR3 SDRAM, 320GB 5400RPM hard drive, Windows 8 64-bit)PROS: Quadcore A6-1450  SoC are usually in notebooks at +$450 category but for HPs asking $350ish ?

Prices fluctuates too much, if sellers increase their prices closer to $400 i would not recommend buying this or any 11.6\" note books.
