{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good business laptop.", "Author": "djfola", "ReviewID": "R3E3K4B99VGHK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for a coworker who needed a solid business laptop for general use. I replaced the boot drive with a Samsung 250GB EVO SSD to make it more shockproof and faster booting. The screen is bright, the computer is reasonably light. The keyboard is better that I expected. The system comes loaded with Windows 7 Professional 64 bit with a fair amount of Lenovo bloatware; I reloaded the system with generic Windows 7 OEM install CDs and updated the drivers from the Lenovo website. This process required extracting and backing up the OEM license key and activation information before reloading, a process aided by free third-party tools readily available online. Google it before you attempt this process. The system comes supplied with restore CDs are for Windows 8,  which I don't plan to use anytime soon.BTW, I bought the same model laptop for myself, although with the upgraded 1600x900 screen and am very happy with it. I also upgraded the harddrive to the Samsung 250GB EVO SSD drive and upgraded the system memory to 8GB with a Crucial memory upgrade kit. I also replaced the optical drive with a second Ultrabay hardrive adapter; the original harddrive now spins happily along as a second data drive there.At work, we've always bought Dell Latitude E65x0 series laptops but I'm switching over to the Lenovo T-series from here on; they're built as well, cost less, and work just as well as the Dells, which are fine machines in their own right.Links to upgrade parts:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E3W1726/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005LDLVAO/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Built like a Clydesdale.

Geiger \"BlessedRmeek\"", "ReviewID": "R208VOKPM7VAEQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Number 1 'LIKE' over most other laptops is, The touchpad is in the center, not offset to the left. ---- It has a dedicated volume rocker button up top. ---- The speakers, while not overly loud, use Dolby and surround technology to give the user a great listening experience. ---- I LOVE the keyboard light. except it lights too large an area. ---- Operation is sooo quiet, with no fan noise or harddrive noise. It also runs very cool. You can use it in your lap without worrying about blocking the fan or having to use a laptop cooler. ---- It sips battery power. I can run sometimes for two days of medium use on a charge.----  The LED screen gives a very good picture quality. But the screen's matte finish isn't the best in bright sunlight.----  It does take longer than my Dell to wake up from hibernate mode, but it's worth the wait. ---- It runs as fast as the antivirus software allows it to. I use Norton 360 which does slow it down a little, but the safety is worth it.---- The case it mil-spec. Which means it is made to military specifications. I have seen units for sale with cracked cases, so they aren't actually indestructible, but I haven't seen units with broken screens for sale either. I put mine in and out of a toolbag all day long and subject it to a rough ride sometimes, so I need the durability. ---- I love the chicklet keyboard. I am not a typist so I like the space around the keys. My wife is a typist, and she LOVES the keyboard. It has number keys at the top, but not a number pad on the right, so the keys that I use are centered on the unit. A big PLUS. AND The TOUCHPAD is centered. Not offset to the left like most 15 inch models. I'm not a leftist, so this is the one for me.  ----  IN SUMMARY : )  I have used a Laptop Computer for work since 2000, and paid about the same for that first Compaq with a 8 GB harddrive as I did for this one. Economically, that makes this an awesome deal.
