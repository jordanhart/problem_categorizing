{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop with few downsides", "Author": "Aman Diwakar", "ReviewID": "RNL492JHFQDVA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this laptop during black friday from Microsoft Store. Comes with Windows Ultimate Premium Home, very light, stays cool and the battery lasts for about 4 hours. Boots up fast, is mostly setup and ready to go. I hooked up an external drive using both eSata and USB and they both performed well, with eSata being faster for file transfers. The internal 320gb hard drive spins well and the 4gb of memory is enough to run multiple applications simultaneously. The screen though, is small, so you can't have too many windows opened at the same time due to the small screen real estate.The unit does not come with built in optical drive, but has SD slots, so you can use your MS, SD by simply plugging it in. The keyboard is very easy to use, for a small laptop and the keys are nice and big, so you don't really have to get used to it, its just like typing on a regular keyboard.One of the best parts of this laptop is the built in camera, which comes with a little light next to it for Skyping or other video based calling. The light brightens up your face even in low light conditions and works really well, I was very happy with it. I hooked up my Sony TV using the HDMI and the system automatically detected the television type and set the resolution to 1920x1200 (HD) and played a movie off my laptop very well, here I was pleasantly surprised at the performance of the video card and the HDMI output.Surfing shouldn't be a problem as the interal wireless antenna performs well and picks up and maintains a signal for reliable web browsing. Audio output is also excellent and very good for a small unit.All in all, great little laptop for the money, highly recommended.", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Just too great for such a low price", "Author": "S. Ganguly", "ReviewID": "R2MT5H3T8LW68O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the laptop for 400$+14$ shipping. Its got EVERYTHING I need. Its LED 13-inch screen is crystal clear, and with Atlec Lansing speakers built right into this bad boy, its perfect for movies, music and what not. Gaming? Its CPU is  bit weak(Dual Core 1.2 ghz) which wouldn't be expected to run any games. But this processor is a new one, with it's architecture the same as the i3, i5 and i7. With the 1695 MB of built in graphics memory, its runs games real smooth. Plus, its got a webcam built in. When you connect in a monitor/projector, it auto-detects the size of it and adjusts accordingly. The keyboard is just.......ordinary. You don't need to get used to it. If you know how to type, you'll be fine.", "Date": "August 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "VIVO always great to deal with.", "Author": "itsnorcal", "ReviewID": "R3TDJNZF606CMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "VIVO Technology is my go to company when it pertains to laptop screens.They ship quickly, prices are fair, and the screens are always in brand new condition.Guaranteed no dead pixels, so if a few pop up on arrival of screen, they will do their best to take care of the buyer.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Reliable, compact, good deal", "Author": "je damore", "ReviewID": "R2HNKLAEWM7XSE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had purchased an Acer and had problems right away, fortunately I was able to return it for a full refund and decided to go back to an HP and am very pleased with its performance.
