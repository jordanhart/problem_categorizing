{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great buy laptop from Toshiba", "Author": "Jed Shlackman", "ReviewID": "R29KUNU8YOMP25", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop in September 2011 at a great sale price as I was looking for a nw laptop that would handle HD videos and output them through an HDMI port. This laptop has the HDMI port and has many great features for the price, such as Pentium dual-core processor, webcam, 4gb RAM and 500GB HDD, a wide 15+ inch screen, and Toshiba's reputation for quality. It doesn't have a ton of software loaded on but that wasn't a concern for me. It runs smoothly and handles pretty much any task you can perform. The battery lasts pretty long and so far no heating up problems, which can plague some laptops. If this lasts as well as my last Toshiba laptop (which still runs OK after 7 years) then it will represent a great value for a portable computer.", "Date": "November 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Budget Laptop", "Author": "Gary Armstrong \"Hammerstein\"", "ReviewID": "R2HOK7S04K6NUJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from OfficeMax when it was on sale for $369 - $50 in store coupon for computers a couple weeks ago for a total $319. The price triggered me to buy it since I needed a laptop with HDMI out to play movies, netflix, etc... on my TV.  For the price, the laptop is excellent.  It is fast enough for my purposes, and certainly has enough installed memory.My only concern is the quality of the LCD. I find it not very vibrant and the viewing angles are limited.  However, for $319, this was an excellent buy !!", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Satellite", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R382AWAOA4Q75P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It product is is in okay position.
