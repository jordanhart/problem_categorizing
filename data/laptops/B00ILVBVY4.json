Set Default Format to 96000 Hz or higher (Sound->Playback: Speakers, Properties->Advanced)  - For whatever reason this seems to drastically improve sound quality for many users immediately, particularly with the headphones output which seems to have an obvious, reproducible bug (at least for me). Don't forget this setting gets reset if you do any driver updates etc.2.  Use the DTS app to adjust for sound quality as preferred  - Although some people reported deinstalling/updating things immediately resolved their issues, for me it made no difference whatsoever and I was able to come to a better sounding setup via DTS than with the Realtek driver settings. Unnecessary for me for the headphones out, but I could make the built in speakers sound significantly better (if still not amazing -- they have a stunning lack of bass, even for a cheap laptop)", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "less than one month", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R1C059Y3GLO66H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop lasted less than one month. Toshiba makes you pay for the shipping to send it back. I wish I would have gotten something else.What really gets me mad is that I use it for school and now I won't have it for the end of the semester. I now have to fight for a computer in the library and they don't even have the software I need. So I have to write code in notepad and send it in without running it.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "My tTshiba laptop", "Author": "PrinceQue", "ReviewID": "R1MCWGJENKDDE6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My laptop fits my need exactly.

Only problem was that the sound was horrible when I first tested it, BUT solution was easy (turn on DTS on Control Panel).Touchscreen works great, there's the option of also having a keyboard on it, so that's nice.Overall, very good product for the price.
