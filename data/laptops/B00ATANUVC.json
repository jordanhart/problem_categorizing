My husband had to uninstall MacFee and fixed bunch of settings before it's usable. Still the booting time is long (I think that's more of Windows 8 fault). Battery last about 5 hours. The right shift key is shorter than normal so I often hit the wrong key in the beginning. I wish it has backlit keyboard because when I work beside my sleeping baby, I would turn down the brightness, which also makes it hard to see the keyboard. I suppose you can see the keyboard if you use full brightness. The touch pad is a little sensitive and like to the beginning of the sentence a lot. But it's bearable. I just have to use a real mouse when working on writing tasks.It's look and feel is fairly similar to Mac Pro, I have to say. It's a power house with high CPU power but so far I haven't done any task that would use that kind of power. I'd rather the battery lasted longer. My baby spilled milk on it with the lid closed. So far, it's still working ;-). It feels tough and well-made. The keyboard feels good to type on.

I have installed Ubuntu 13.04, so this review won't address pros and cons of Windows 8.For the most part, this is an excellent laptop. Most things work out nicely, in fact, I only have relatively few complaints:1. There has been two instances where I had trouble connecting to the internet (while others around me could connect). I'm not sure about the source of the problem, but usually restarting helped here for some reason.EDIT: I have had more issues connecting online, mostly inconsistency (that is, disconnecting and reconnecting somewhat frequently). My roommates do not have this issue, so I believe it's due to this laptop.2. There has been two instances where the laptop was overheating, once while charging and once while I was carrying it unplugged. Again, not sure about the source of the problem.3. The battery life probably is not as high as advertised, although Lenovo is not the only company that does this. Battery life really depends on the settings of the computer. If A uses lower brightness settings than B, then A will definitely have a longer battery life. My suggestion to getting more battery life is to turn off Wifi and Bluetooth when you're not using it, and maybe keep the screen brightness at auto-brightness or lower.Overall, I have had few problems with this computer. I am slightly worried about the overheating and wireless issues because they occurred within one month of my purchase, but I think this computer will run well for at least three years.", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just Great!", "Author": "JassimQatar", "ReviewID": "R3CLQ8KGH6X7VJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Ultrabook has a really catchy design and very well organized when using it for the first time.I recommend it for everyonne.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Chuck", "Author": "chuck", "ReviewID": "R31ESSKFOHVHET", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just purchased this laptop.
