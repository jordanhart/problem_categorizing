Watson", "ReviewID": "R30XSLLSSWWQAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My last computer was a Toshiba P25-S609 running XP Pro. That was the top of the line in something like 2004. Finally broke down due to Windows abandoning XP. Spent hours shopping on Amazon. This was the only machine that turned me on. Maxed out configuration, yet practical. Not going out of date tomorrow. Also very pleased with this seller. Packed well, extremely responsive via email and phone, fast shipping. Delighted. I was kind of skeptical about solid state drive, but when you realize it does not need to spin up, wow, it makes for very fast boot. Recommended as configured here.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast, Quiet, Beautiful display", "Author": "Andy", "ReviewID": "ROA2JXF5JZL8M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Really like this laptop.  Never purchased a Toshiba before, but I might do it again when the time arises.  The one I purchased has a 256GB solid state Drive, 24GB RAM.  It's almost instant on when in in sleep mode.Biggest complaint about the unit is the sensitivity of the mouse pad.  When surfing the web the screen will zoom in because I horizontally swiped my thumb across the pad and had my index finger \"scrolling\" up/down.  Also, if you go to use the keyboard and accidentally swipe the mouse pad, you could inadvertently highlight a bunch of text and if not careful, delete some of your document.Overall, very very nice laptop.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EYZOFM6"}}
