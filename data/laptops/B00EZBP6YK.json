Trackpad, while large, is not as smooth as it looks.Vertical/horizontal scroll is very spotty. Only works about 15% of the time.I've gone through blogs that suggest update the driver, which I did. It still has the issue.Best thing to do: Buy this from a store that accepts returns well after 30 days (i.e., Costco) so you can return it and avoid technical support denials.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't purchase without good warranty", "Author": "Karly", "ReviewID": "R283YR6BUURO01", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I liked this laptop at first. It's a little on the large side, but I guess this is the new standard for laptop sizes, disappointing because it doesn't fit in my bookbag. backlit keyboard is nice and touch screen in a definite plus. However, this laptop began to crumble quickly. The mousepad stopped working within a few weeks and I've been using an external mouse since. Then it would shut off or not turn on if unplugged. Now today, its not charging at all. I did a backup on all my files and I'm returning it today. Thank goodness for costco's extended return periods and warranty", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.99", "Features": "Screen Size: 15.6\"\nScreen Resolution: 1366 x 768\nProcessor Type: Intel\nProcessor Model: i5-3337U\nProcessor Speed: 1.8GHz", "Name": "Acer 15.6\" Aspire Laptop 8GB 1TB | V5-572P-6646", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41n4LpK27ZL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EZBP6YK"}}
