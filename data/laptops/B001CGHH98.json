It's obviously not as fast as a brand new computer, but I can't believe how fast it is! So far I have been able to use it for everything I bought it to do.  I understand it's not good for gaming, or perhaps watching youtube.  That was not the basis for my decision as those were not things I needed.  I highly recommend this product for anyone that needs a laptop for school/internet useage.  It's been a great buy!I bought it from Technoid, and it is used but in very good shape.  Just some smudges and some scratches (barely).  The battery has lasted a long time on its first charge.

Then, after waiting for a week with no answered, call the seller and the same person who advice me to mail it then said he couldn't do anything about it. He was not going to fix either return or credit the money. So basically i lost over $200 just like that.Do not get anything from this people.
