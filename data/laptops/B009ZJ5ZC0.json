All in all not a bad laptop for my needs.  Use mainly for work, spreadsheets and presentations and all that.  Arrived prepackaged with windows 8 and Microsoft office.  I'm only giving two stars because in the past year both laptops have had the exact same problem. Both suffered lcd screen burnout.  Luckily we had, as we always do, purchased an extended warranty through Costco and simply called the concierge service to have each repaired.  In each instance Dell had the laptop fixed within a week with no other issues since. If we hadn't purchased an extended warranty we would have been S.O.L.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "Smile123", "ReviewID": "R4EHQQLHH8UZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought 4 of these computers for all of my children for Christmas, it is a wonderful gift. This is perfect for just starting out and for school projects. They are so happy with them.  It was very inexpensive and wonderful for the price.

Really cheaply made and keyboard is overly sensitive. The same day, the mousepad went out. I ignored this since the bundle came with a wireless mouse. In May, the hard drive stopped working. I contacted Dell who were very polite and attentive and they resolved the issue, saying the hard drive had gone bad. In August, the LCD screen burned out (which is not covered by the warranty).  They want $258 parts and service and $12 in tax to replace the LCD.  I'm going to replace the screen myself, sell it and trade up to a new BRAND and model.  Overall good and persistent customer service but the WORST  piece of equipment I've ever owned.

Problems never resolved after 2 months with Dell. 1) Wireless connection in my home inconsistent at best, drop-out of connection ever 5-10min (not the case with any other device in my home). Keypad, almost on usable, would jump to other locations at any given time, again never had this problem with any other computer.  Sorry to say,but Dell seems to be cutting back a quality.

They performed some manual setting changes worked until I cycled power and it was back.  Tried calling them tonight I was either put on hold or the call was dropped.

Bought this in November 2012, great until a Restart or worse, a Windows Update - all Internet is lost. Many many MANY hours spent with Dell the emails with them, then found it sort of worked at the church network so shifted to TalkTalk our ISP. After 2 evenings with them they have kindly sent a new router - then last night it wouldn't connect at church!I have (for the 15th time) restored it back to Factory settings (where it all wotks) and switched off Windows Updates (again!) and will de-install McAfee (again!) - if it doesn't work this time its going back.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolute waste of money", "Author": "ItsN0tS4ne", "ReviewID": "RMKFPZ7S0EEFJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Wow, I'm very disappointed to say the least. Not only is this laptop cheaply made, but I have had nothing but problems it ever since I got it (and I assure you, I'm not computer illiterate). I bought the laptop in January of 2013, and it became pretty much unusable by March 2013. I had it for only three months when it broke down on me, and I only used it to go online (I don't download anything, I really just come here on Amazon.com, Facebook, and the occasional browse). I have a security system on it as well and ran full scans on it every few days.Well, it has been giving me a completely black screen immediately upon initial login, making the laptop completely unusable.What is most frustrating about this is that DELL Support is absolutely useless. I have called multiple times, waited on hold for hours just to speak with somebody that can hardly speak english to gives me a useless canned response. Not to mention they also give me different responses every time I call, and they've tried to sell me one ($150-$270) \"miracle fix\" after another, after of course insisting that the issue isn't their problem. Oh, not to mention these \"fixes\" are inconsistent- it's always something else I should purchase to fix the laptop that I've only had for about 3 months.Yes, it seems like a good deal, but at this point, to salvage it, it's looking like I would have to spend more money on these \"fixes\" than I spent on the laptop in the first place.If you buy this laptop and it doesn't work, you're pretty much SOL unless you can return it to the website/store you bought it from. Unless of course you want to pay for a fix- but then you might as well get a better quality laptop.Not worth the time, not worth the frustration, and CERTAINLY NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!Plus, Windows 8 is absolutely horrid. Not user friendly, just a pain in the butt really (but that is just my opinion).", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Ports, Slots & Chassis: Externally Accessible - (1) VGA Port, (1) HDMI, (3) USB 2.0, (1) Ethernet / RJ45, (1) Microphone Jack, (1) Headphone Jack\nCamera: 1.0MP HD Integrated Webcam w/ built-in analog microphone\nAudio and Speakers: (2) 2.0W speakers w Waves MaxxAudio 3\nOptical Drive: 8x Tray Load CD/DVD Burner (DVD+/-RW Drive)\nWi-Fi Options:\nDell Wireless card 802.11 b/g/n (2.4G), BT4.0+HS", "Name": "Dell Inspiron 3520 16-Inch Laptop (2nd Gen Intel Core Processor, 500GB Hard Drive, Windows 8 64-bit)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51XOzOPghDL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009ZJ5ZC0"}}
