I've never had any signicant issues with it. The keyboard is a little smaller than a laptop, but unless you have really large hands it shouldn't be a problem. I actually bought an Asus before this one and had to return it because the mouse pad was too close to the space bar (which made the mouse jump around every time I hit the space bar- drove me nuts!). This one is a lot better because there's a nice gap between the two. Another thing I like is that it's fairly light which is nice when you're traveling. Overall I'd say it's a pretty solid machine. It's good for using the internet and word processing. I'd recommend it.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Feedback", "Author": "O.", "ReviewID": "R15N9V8WYYHGL9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The item is fantastic.
