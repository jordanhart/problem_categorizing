I would recommend this company to buy it from and as the product is always the best and the warranty can not be matched or beat. It doubles, its a laptop, no wait, its a tablet, no wait, its both. It is a must for business oriented or trainers or for just using it daily use. It covers everyone. Did I mention. I love Asus. It is very fast. Easily connect via Wi-Fi or with the included Ethernet connector. Running windows 8. Two partitions which are extremely hard to even fill up one. Included also is the mini hdmi to hdmi. The included touch pen doubles as a two button mouse. Two year warranty is excellent. The first year anything accidental is covered(liquid, shock, fire or drops). The second year is the normal parts and labor being covered. There is so many things that are truly amazing with this product that I would run out of room if I continue I will run out of space. All I can say is buy it. You will not regret it.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,049.00", "Features": "Primary Information Processor Type\tCore i7 Processor Manufacturer\tIntel Processor Clock Speed\t1.90 GHz Hard Drive Capacity\tN/A Solid State Dirve\t256 GB Webcam\tTablet: 5M Pixel Camera, NB: HD Camera Header / Model\tTAICHI21-DH71 Features\tInstant On, NFC, Sleeve, Stylus, 10 fingers Touch, B&O; certified speakers Laptop System Type\tNotebook Display Display Diagonal Size\t11.6 Inch Display Technology\tTFT Active Matrix Max Resolution\t1920 x 1080 Memory Cache Memory Type\tL3 Cache Cache Memory Installed Size\t4 MB RAM Installed Size\t4 GB RAM Technology\tDDR3 SDRAM Processor Processor Number\t3517U Dimensions&Miscellaneous; Weight\t2.7 lbs.
