It has everything I wanted and needed except for Lightscribe and a light-up keyboard (not offered by Compaq). I like Compaq, because the delete key is in the upper right hand corner of the keyboard, easily found without having to look for it.", "Date": "January 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Waiting for a refund...", "Author": "Donna J.", "ReviewID": "RKPH54R9HZHG9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The computer wasn't working properly and I returned it . The shipper received the returned computer on the  12th of October and am awaiting my refund.  I needed this computer for school and so I have replaced it already.
