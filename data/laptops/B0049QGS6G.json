I should have returned it but wanted one so bad because it is such a work of art by Steve Jobs. This computer made a sputtering noise and then after owning it a month the real problems started. I am a writer and so I use laptops as typewriters. This is the worst I have ever owned. When typing, the paragraphs would disappear or the curser would jump to another area and make you type words out of order. The keys would not make words as fast as you could type. It also could never work without being plugged in. I ended up pawning it and only got $20. Very sad.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great starter for someone that has never owned a Mac", "Author": "Ganogrlshop", "ReviewID": "R7HCNH7Z0L2G3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its an ace computer!
