Debian 4.0 (etch) installed right out of the box and everything ran except the touchpad was slow; all you have to do is edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf by adding the line: [Option \"AccelFactor\" \"2.5\"] to the synaptics touchpad section and it's fixed. Most wireless cardbus adapters work; just Google how to install them. The thing just plain works with Debian, much faster (even with only 256K!) and more stable than with anything Microsoft sells. Best part is, the OS and all the software are free! Wipe both of the Windows partitions from  your hard drive, install Debian by taking over the whole disk, and you'll have a machine with room to spare.

Pierson", "ReviewID": "R2YBF6AYQGBIW4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought it thinking that Sony was a good brand, but they clearly have no clue when it comes to making computers.The first problem is the battery life.  At first, it could last 20 minutes of websurfing, but now it doesn't last five minutes of sitting still with nothing going on.  It immediately powers down without shutting down of hibernating.The second problem is the default hard drive configuration.  Basically, they split it up which causes more problems since so many programs install to the C: drive by default anyway, plus Windows XP is bloated and takes up the majority of the space anyway, then PC-Cillin tries to take up a lot of space too and you've almost lost all of your C: drive space from these two programs alone.The third problem is the graphics card.  It's integrated with the normal memory and has horrible performance.  While I don't expect to be playing the latest games on this machine, it's not even capable of playing games that are ten years old with a decent speed.The fourth problem that I have is the LCD itself.  It's not very bright, and with any sunlight at all it's unreadable.Other than those, it's a pretty standard machine.  I managed to avoid some of the software problems others have by uninstalling one of the hotfixes of XP and upgrading the mouse drivers.", "Date": "March 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "Worst computer ever", "Author": "J.

The FXA47 is loaded with software and problems and VERY POOR customer support.  In the 2 years we have had it, it has stayed in the case most of the time because of lockups.  I have restored it several times to original configurations with no help.  Sony is clueless and wants to charge for phone supoport and has only responded to 1 of my e-mails.  It seems that everytime we install software the computer wants to lock up.  My Compaq 2715US works great with out any problems.  I will never by another Sony product.", "Date": "February 2, 2004"}, {"Title": "It's ok most of the time", "Author": "S. Pierson", "ReviewID": "R295WHG4GNUFCW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been mostly ok with this laptop until recently, but there are a few problems that I must mention:1)  The battery life is horrible.  When you unplug it, it may tell you that it's going to last two hours, but even new, the battery only lasts about 20 minutes of just websurfing (if you are watching a DVD or anything like that, you'll be lucky to get much more than 5 minutes from the battery.)2)  It gets too hot.  I've found that different programs cause it to heat differently.  I tried running Seti@Home on this laptop, but that caused my lap to almost get burned.  You have to be very careful with that.  Also, the rubber feet on the bottom of the laptop have come off because the heat of the CPU melts the glue on the bottom.  This has made a mess of the various tables I've put it on, as well as some pants when I've used it on my lap.3)  The sleep functions don't work right.  Every other laptop I've used has had a function to make the laptop shut down or go to sleep automatically when the battery gets too low.  This laptop doesn't appear to have this.  When it feels like it, it will just shut down with no warning.  This has happened at random times when I don't have it plugged into the power.4)  The drivers stink.  There are various problems related to Windows hotfixes and some of the specific hardware drivers.  I forget which one but there was a hotfix for XP that conflicted with the mousepad driver and caused the laptop to freeze up.  As far as I know, Sony never fixed the driver so I've left the patch off.I doubt I'll ever buy a Sony laptop again, but it's not the worst I've used.  I'll probably buy an IBM Thinkpad next time, because they are the best laptops you can buy.", "Date": "October 22, 2003"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000062TTC"}}
