{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The key word in the description is \"barebone\"", "Author": "John R. Godwin", "ReviewID": "RGNXEU6AL84YX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"Barebone\" can vary but typically you don't get a processor, hard drive, memory or operating system. That said, the description has other more serious errors that can be resolved by typing the model # (937-175822-011) into a search engine and going to the MSI Whitebook website. It says there that the LCD is 1600x900 not 1920x1080 and that this is for Intel mobile Haswell processors not Ivy Bridge (the I5-3320M is Ivy Bridge).  You should only buy a barebone laptop if you are comfortable with disassembling a laptop and installing the processor yourself. You will need a good heat-sink compound for this.I have an older Ivy Bridge version of this laptop and I'm very happy with it.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Peice", "Author": "xuanlin xu", "ReviewID": "RNGODLGBS587V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Key word is bare-bone, as a bare-bone kit of laptop, this is a pretty high performance piece.

If MSI is going to sell a barebones kit, and is simply mentioning what the system can handle, they need to explain that thoroughly, or people are going to be disappointed.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Didn't purchase, just a complaint.", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R4AUBDX8F48LP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "In the same light as the other reviewer, I would also like MSI or Amazon or whoever is selling these to clean up and improve the product description for ALL their barebones kits. The one star is just to hopefully get their attention.I was considering purchasing not exactly this barebones kit, but others as well however the listings were tremendously confusing. In addition to the mixed messaging whether they come with a CPU/HDD/RAM (I know they probably wouldn't, even though some specify otherwise) do they include a DVD drive, wireless card, etc? Does it even have a slot for a DVD drive?Get on the ball Amazon. I'm sure you guys don't exactly hire tech geeks, but I would expect better from you.", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Am", "Author": "Rich Ender", "ReviewID": "R139VUMLVRBJZG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Items are missing - CPU, Memory, OS as described in the listing and in the Tech info too.

It is advertised as having a hard drive an operating system, processor and components that make a computer(laptop) work. when i looked it up i found that most barebones have components that you have to put together, this one had none even with it. just a fan and battery connection. I think it should be honest about the specs and say its capable of 16gb memory,7200 rpm harddrive and windows 8 operating system. its just a shell that you would have to put another $850 just to get it working properly.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GMB4PF2"}}
