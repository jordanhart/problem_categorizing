This one I got has 4GB of ram and 128GB harddrive. I use this laptop mainly for browsing the internet and some programming. Now that you have a little background Ill give a quick review.From the get go this laptop is MUCH faster then my previous Macbook air. When you open the lid you are ready to go that second. On the old one I would have to wait a little for it to load and if I left chrome up and clicked on it right away then I would get the loading wheel. I havent seen this do it once. That could be because of the harddrive being so much faster.When I opened the box the laptop was already charged to 91% so im trying to kill it. Well I was on it ALL NIGHT last night and now its the morning and its only at 60%. That battery life is amazing and let me honest thats what we ask for in a laptop.If you are up in the air about this laptop(no pun intended). I would say give it a go. You could even buy it from the Apple store and if you dont like it just return it.If you are replacing an older Macbook air and have one thats because the mid 2012 then I would say get it but if you have the mid 2012 I dont know if I would suggest spending the money unless you really want battery. I hope this helps anyone trying to purchase this laptop.I am not an Apple fan boy. My desktop is a custom build Window machine so I know both worlds. Please if you have any questions just comment and I will be happy to try things for you or just answer questions.I am a Computer Engineer so im use to testing things so feel free to ask.(This is my first review)", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "MBA Will Be Perfect Once It Gets Retina Display", "Author": "Mike B", "ReviewID": "R434HN9G6BT0B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This might look like just a minor spec bump from last years model. However, the new MBA boasts all day battery life: 11 inch (9 hours) and 13 inch (12 hours). This is a big step up from the previous generation. This is due to a larger battery and more efficient processor. The upcoming OS X Mavericks is supposed to be even more energy efficient than Mountain Lion. The MBA is also faster due to the new processor and has a faster wifi connection. The solid state drive in this computer makes it much faster than a regular hard drive computer.This is a great computer overall. The screen is not as nice as the retina Macbook Pro, however it is not a deal breaker. The MBA is a lightweight, portable computer and the Retina screen is thicker, heavier, and more expensive. Once they manage to make a thin, lightweight Retina Display this computer might be perfect. You will probably not miss the disc drive on this computer because it is a featherweight without it and you can use an external disc drive if you have to or remotely access another computer with a disc drive.If you are debating between the 11 and 13 inch models, it depends on what you want to use it for. The extra screen space, SD card slot, and longer battery life for $100 more makes the 13 inch a worthy choice. However, some want a truly portable machine that can fit easily in a large purse or briefcase.If you are debating between this computer and an iPad with a bluetooth keyboard, consider the ease of use and functionality of the computer versus the portability and cost of an iPad. For students, it is nice to have a real keyboard and be able to easily create documents, spreadsheets, and powerpoints on an actual computer, but I see more and more students with iPads and a keyboard case getting by just fine.If you are debating between 128GB and 256GB (or custom order 512GB from Apple), consider cloud storage. Flickr now has 1 TB free photo storage with no size restrictions. Google Drive and Evernote are great for documents and you can always store your iTunes library on an external hard drive if you have a massive library.If you are debating between this and a Windows Ultrabook/ Google Chromebook, consider the operating system, reliability, customer service, and resale value. People love Apple products and you can resell the computer if you want to eventually upgrade. They hold their value pretty well. The operating system takes a little getting used to but it is a lot smoother than Windows and you will probably never want to switch back to the dark side. If you really need a Windows Program, you can run Windows on a Mac.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply the awesomest one out there", "Author": "Jonathan Arnoux", "ReviewID": "R1NSENQ6BRBUR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was shopping for a laptop for college and I was initially not considering buying a Mac by principle (anti-Apple-ism, price,...). However, I received many good arguments to buy the Macbook Air and was finally convinced because all the other laptops working under windows I was considering had problems of some sorts, as reviewed by many users. Therefore, I bought the Macbook Air with a 14-day trial. I thought I would bring it back but I never did and ever since it's been a love story.Even though you've probably already heard it all, here are overall the best things about the Macbook Air that makes it the best laptop out there (even with the new Macbook Pro):-Battery life is excellent and recovery is fast. There are several ways to make the battery last longer and some options in your settings.-It's SUPER light, which is a major plus for a college student if you need to bring it to class and around. After a few weeks working with it I was surprised how big and heavy other laptops seemed to me, you have no idea.-The design is very nice, but that's a somewhat subjective notion.-It really doesn't take long to get the hang of all the commands and you might discover some cool \"shortcuts\" by accident, like I did. The experience is just wonderful and if you need any help, there are just so many websites and blogs that can help you and have tutorials or problem solving for new-to-Mac users like me.-The operating system upgrades are free, unlike Windows'. The new OS X Mavericks is just amazing, it's slick, stylish, colourful and just so much adapted to a student's needs!-You can work on many screens, so multitasking is made easy.-If you're Windows-nostalgic, you have the possibility to install a parallel. Plus, the Office for Mac is mainly the same as the Windows one except there are maybe more templates and the designs are more aesthetically appealing. You can also install Google Chrome, Mozilla and other browsers, as you wish.-Internet-browsing is fast and you can zoom/unzoom pics just with your fingers and the trackpad.-The trackpad is life itself in the form of a technologic device: it just feels so smooth and you almost feel like you're the one moving the page like you would with a book or magazine.-The new OS X Mavericks gives you iBooks for free, and iMaps and you can add a map or directions to your events on iCalendar.-If you have an iPhone or iPad, you can sync them with your Macbook and you just have an infinity of possibilities and uses.I hope this was useful and that it helped you in your decision-making process.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing, am shocked how it far outperforms my older Macbook Air", "Author": "VeritasluxMea \"Neoplatonic Platonist\"", "ReviewID": "R1RAKRYX5GWI32", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Working off formerly a 13\" macbook air mid 2011, I just bought this new 2013 model with the Haswell CPU and low power consumption infrastructure.Off a full charge, I disconnected 3 hours 40 mins and had an external drive connected the entire time, restarted 4 times, and did NONSTOP heavy application installs (Office suite, Photoshop etc.), a total of 23 applications, and ran youtube vids in the background the entire time, and after all of that nonstop heavy loading, I had 76% on my battery, of which id have around 35% on my older Macbook Air.Further still, the entire unit has run UTTERLY COOL during this EXTREMELY heavy loading, installing and heavy 1080P video graphics play. My other Macbook Air would be almost too hot to touch underneath near back under same conditions.Even without 802ac (new Wifi connection thru the new Air), I notice roughly 25% faster throughput on likewise file downloads using my new Macbook Air than that of my older version Macbook Air.This new Macbook Air contains PCIe-Based Flash Storage Approaches 800 MB/s Read and Write. I notice BLAZING fast write speed on my 1.1 Gig Photoshop app, and seemed about 40% faster than my previous generation Macbook Air. Also, this new Air model contains PCIe-based SSD modules made by Samsung and is smaller than the previous Air model SSD made by Toshiba.These new Airs also sport batteries with increased capacity driven by higher voltages: increasing from a 7.3 V, 6700 mAh power battery to a 7.6 V 7150 mAh power battery. Other changes include a redesigned expanded heat sink covering both the CPU and GPU, which must be why this unit runs SO COOL even maxed out.ALL my apps run perfect on this new Air, including Office suite, and the entire Adobe suite and the rest of my apps, ....which it should, its still running Mountain Lion OS.I really have to say again, that write speeds on HUGE app instals is just faster than you dare hope for; its just blazing faster than my previous gen. Air.My Macbook Air has been without a question my most treasured gem of \"go-to\" Mac product hands down, I own all of them (2 Airs, Macbook Pro, MacMini etc),...I was skeptical when I shelled out $1099 today for the new Haswell Air and its presumed prognosticated \"crazy long\" battery life and improved speeds overall; but the hype isn't hype, its real and amazing. The mere NOTION that I can overload this Air with App installs, and have a 2.5\" HD attached for nearly 4 hours, run 1080P Youtube vids,...and still be at 76% Batt life is just, well, its stunning.Tested out the NEW dual (stereo) mic and it IS much nicer in record, additionally the camera/vid is much sharper and  crisper than my other Mac Air.  Considering the price point is lower on these new Airs than the older ones,  I give the new Macbook Airs a \"110%\". Having repaired laptops (non mac) in the past, and owned at least 20X more laptops than most consumers, I don't lightly conclude this is the cornerstone workhorse for everything I dare consider doing, fast got faster, and battery life now is enough to make a crusty \"hates everything\" person like myself nearly cry with joy. Congrats Apple! Homerun on this lovely gem.I didnt get this delivered in one day, I picked it up from my local Mac store, I got my buddy to sell it to me 1 day before they officially \"have\" them which is today 6/12. As for the questions about using this new Air with Photoshop and it lagging on heavy filtering and photo editing, Ive tested that fully and this IS the machine you want for ultimate portability, it works fantastic.Also of great importance is that this version of Mac Air is supposed to have \"nearly double\" fast write speeds as the Macbook Pro Retina. And the new Hard storage on this Air has \"up to 6X faster than a 5400RPM disk drive\" as found in current Macbook Pro which contain 5400RPM Toshiba Hard drives (made by Hitachi for Toshiba actually). In short, YES, this is a perfect \"must own\" book in the field or travel use for photoshop work, with just blazing fast write speeds, and crazy long battery life.This new Macbook Air brings TRUE definition to being \"disconnected\" and \"portable\" to those who want to do a LOT of work free of the power socket!

I couldn't figure out if I wanted the Pro Retina or the Air, and I wasn't sure if I wanted 13 in. or 11 in. Now, I actually own both the Macbook Pro 13\" Retina and the new Macbook Air 11 inch, and I understand most people won't want to buy both but these are my thoughts. I first got the 13\" Retina, because I loved the screen, esp. the way text looked because I read a lot and it made such a difference. I have the i7 version, plus the 8 GB RAM, and 256 hard drive. I love that thing. It's gorgeous and fast, a pleasure to work on. BUT. The only problem with it for me is the weight. I know it's lighter than it used to be but I'm petite and when I'm traveling and need to give presentations, this thing is in my bag the entire day, and I find it heavy. Many people may well be stronger than I am but I personally find it a pain to drag around when I'm on the road. Also, the battery life is good but not brilliant, so if I use it all morning and a part of the afternoon unplugged, it's dead.So I recently bought the 11 inch Macbook Air as well, the new version, also maxed out, i7, 8 GB, etc. It is so light, it's amazing. It' lightning fast and the battery life is incredible. I can use it and use it and the battery won't budge. However. The screen is so much less good than my Retina Pro. I'm not a picky person and before I got used to the Retina screen, I didn't mind but now, it's a huge difference. The text is pixelated and very small, the whole thing looks much less good.Basically, I think that if you're going to be mainly stationary when using the laptop, I would definitely go for the Retina Pro 13 inch. At home, it's all I use nowadays. It's a joy to use and looks amazing. However, if you travel a lot and will mainly be using it on the go, I think the new Air is fantastic.  I hardly notice it in my bag and the screen is fine, just not as beautiful as the Retina, plus the performance and battery life are incredible. If the weight of the Retina doesn't bother you, that would be the clear choice.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "A battery that does what a laptop needs / Volume Fluctuation Issue", "Author": "Publicagent \"Publicagent\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q0F7VTF30P2S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using the new Macbook Air for almost a week now. I actually started with the 11 inch because I wanted the lightest possibly laptop, and I used to have a smaller screen, but I guess it was just too small. I was noticing things like a shaking screen and I had been using a 15 inch Macbook Pro with the aluminum keyboard for the last five years. When I got the 13 inch, everything looked and felt just right.In my opinion, a laptop battery has one major task. It should allow users to do everything they want on their laptop without having to plug it back in. I used it for about 1.5 to 2 hours two evenings in a row doing internet surfing, minimal video watching, and some word processing. The next day I used it for close to 8 hours of word processing and internet surfing. You know you have an amazing battery when the bar goes red, and you check to see that you still have two and a half hours remaining. I did not check exact times, but I think I got over 11 hours before charging it back up (including 3 days of sleeping). I was also surprised to see that it had recharged before I went to bed!In this day and age, laptop users should understand that you never get the same amount of battery life watching non-stop high quality videos as you would using basic software and the internet. I use a laptop fairly frequently for projects/entertainment, but can not think of one instance in which I would need over 12 hours of battery life. More than 8 hours and my eyes start to blur. The bottom line is that Apple's initial estimate of 12 hours is not off, and I am happy to say that I will not be taking my charger with me anytime I plan to return to my house to sleep later that evening. I don't have to worry about battery life for the first time.One small quirk is that the time estimates of the battery are sometimes off. For instance, I have checked my battery status and seen an estimate of 17 plus hours remaining. I admittedly got overexcited before it quickly went back down to over 12. The percentage is always accurate, however, and it's intriguing to see how long you can last with 100% battery life remaining.As for the rest of the computer, the keyboard is great, the screen is nice, but not stellar, and there is a slight glare when I work in direct sunlight though it's nothing objectionable. I think that Apple has set a new standard with this laptop because it's obviously light, but the battery is truly amazing. It's also picking up the internet feed in my house as good if not better than my other devices.IMPORTANT UPDATE: I have noticed an issue with volume fluctuation when watching movies on Netflix and sports on ESPN. The issue persists on Safari and Firefox. Unfortunately, other are having this issue and no one that I could find as of yet reports it as being resolved. This is a shame. This laptop is so good otherwise I am still giving it 4 stars, but this is a major issue. I have downgraded to 3 stars until this gets resolved.UPDATE REVISED: The volume fluctuation issue appears to have been fixed with an update. Loving the laptop again.

We have an older 17\" Macbook Pro that has been through the war and still functions perfectly. Since day 1 this MBA has dropped wi-fi connections everywhere continuously, and despite doing everything by the book-phone support and software upgrades, genius bar appointments, higher level support,etc, and 3 swap outs for other machines it still drops wi-fi. This is a widely known issue worldwide, yet Apple still has no fix for it. They continue to sell it and then ignore you or make you jump through senseless hoops for no reason-there is no fix. Was contacted by an Apple engineer who made me run a diagnostic and send it to him. He said he would help me-never heard from him again.After my last genius bar appointment, after running a diagnostic that proved the drop, the best they could offer was for me to upgrade to a retina-pro-at my expense. I really like the machine otherwise, but Apple has really dropped the ball here and in my opinion is committing fraud. There is much speculation on the forums as to why and how, but as consumers its really not our problem to diagnose or fix.They know its broken-its a widely known issue world wide, there is no fix, yet they continue to sell it. The official Apple Macbook support forum has probably 200,000 views on the wi-fi issue posts and 1100+ replies....more than any other post. Wake up Apple!-fix this issue.

Lasts longer than MacBook Pro models especially retinal display4. Very Fast - solid state hard drive not a disc so very quick loadingCons1. Display isn't as nice as the MacBook Pros particularly the retinal display.2. Only two USB ports and thunderbolt  port. No SD port. No Ethernet port3. No Disc Drive \"Optical Drive\" but none of the new Mac lap tops (MacBook Air or MacBook Pro models) have this. Also it wouldn't be a MacBook Air if it had the disc drive(would weigh more) so it's a moot criticism. I already owned a separate disc drive than I can easy attach through a USB port and I never need to use it anyway since everyone can be downloaded online. Only time I need it is to watch DVD'sWhy Mac over PC1. No Spam - search the internet in peace without multiple pop-ups and adware slowing your computer down. No viruses2. Not Windows! - I recently experienced Windows 8 on another laptop and it is atrocious. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with Microsoft products and Windows. I can't believe they found a way to make WIndows more cumbersome3. Intuitive - Macs are designed with human intuition in mind. Everything is designed to be simple and easy to use. You don't need experience with Macs to use this. Since 2007 when Macs began to use Intel chips, the Macs took the best Windows had to offer and improved upon it. You can even buy Microsoft Office for Mac (which I have) so you lose nothing.  So if you are scared to use a Mac, you will find these new Macs are very easy to use.4. Great Service in Apple Store - if something breaks down, Apple is great about replacing parts, computers and honoring warranty.5.

The all aluminum chassis has a pleasing texture, it is lighter yet feels far more solid than any other ultrabook I have encountered. The hinges have no undue give, yet there is little effort needed to engage them.The trackpad is a marvel. After only a few days I am amazed I ever used a Windows laptop without proper OS trackpad integration. Every flick and swipe is picked up and acted upon without hesitation, it is a shame this responsiveness is so alien when coming from Windows.OSX is very polished, lightning fast on this SSD. I find myself much preferring it for every activity I use my PC for besides gaming. Swiping between fullscreen pages is intuitive, trackpad gestures are tight and do much to streamline navigation. I feel more compelled to recommend it to clients, no more ad-ware, no flavor of the week virus infections. No embarrassingly mid-life crisis 'reinventions' to fight with as in Windows 8. One OS for desktops and laptops, separate OS for touch-enabled devices.802.11AC Wifi! I can finally use my lonely 5GHz band! I have not experienced any wireless dropouts or hiccups as others have described.Haswell architecture has enabled an unheard of real-world 10-12 hour wireless browsing battery life while packing a fully featured quad core i5 chip with HD5000 graphics. Unprecedented for this size and weight. HD5000 tackles Skyrim at comfortable mid-level graphics and playable frames, at the expense of extreme system heat.Built in bootcamp allows easy Windows 7 dual booting for those OS specific applications, still eeking out 6-10 hours depending on usage, providing a better Windows experience than Microsoft themselves.CONS:Maybe HDD space? All my music is stored with Google, photos and documents on Dropbox and Skydrive. Install Office and Photoshop and still have 90GB left.This is not really a con, just a function of nature. Packing this chip in this form factor means heat! Working in OSX is fine, doesn't break a sweat. Once you bootcamp Windows 7 and try on your gaming pants however, expect this thing to live at 99 degrees celsius with fans full tilt.I used to argue against Macs purely from a price point perspective, but for $999 (bought at Best Buy) I feel this machine is a steal. I can see myself using this system for the next three years easily. With no mechanical hard drive and sturdy construction it will take quite a drop or impact to take this thing out.In closing, the Macbook Air shows that a carefully controlled eco-system can work in the right hands. As opposed to leaving manufacturers to their own devices and quality control standards, Apple has examined every facet of their platform and made purposeful design choices, polished them over several generations and realized them with very strict hardware standards.I have experienced the Windows 8 bombshell from ground zero. Poorly implemented and designed manufacturer software, random black screen freeze ups and hundreds of other software bugs, 5 different operating system recovery methods for 5 different manufacturers, it no longer makes sense to me.I have been assimilated into the cult of simple OS interface and reliable, controlled hardware platforms.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's small, light & the battery lasts FOREVER.", "Author": "Jonathan Edwards", "ReviewID": "R2CS3FXYZFYE3I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I sat at the store debating on the 11\" MacBook Air or the 13\" MacBook Air for about an hour the day I bought this laptop.

This computer is just so freaking fast. The design is so sexy that this is the Porsche of laptops. I have a Acer Chromebook and a ASUS 15 inch laptop. Both were good but the battery life was horrible. I never got past 4 hours with both machines. I liked the fast boot times on the Chromebook but the \"apps\" for the Chromebook were just web links to the application's website. So I used my Chromebook for Youtube and checking my email. I used my ASUS laptop for gaming and other things but the problem was it had a Pentium chip and games would just lag. I got 30-35 fps on Minecraft on my ASUS. The Macbook Air blows away both these laptops. I am used to Windows and Chrome OS which is basically a version of Linux and it's based on the Google Chrome browser. I hated using my ASUS PC because it always froze and and the fan felt like cooking an egg. My chromebook had a fan on the side (why do laptops have that  that theses days?) The Macbook Air's fan will run if you run game and video editing and stuff like that BUT the fan is on the bottom and and it doesn't kill your lap. I checked the fps on my Macbook Air and I got 80-120 fps on Minecraft which is AMAZING. The battery life is just AWESOME. I can get up to 6-7 hours doing gaming and 9-10 hours surfing the web and playing music in iTunes. This is keyboard feels so nice to type on. People think iPads are going to replace the Mac. Apple has always kept their Mac OS and iOS away from each other but has added iOS features like Maps and iBooks which will be coming in Mac OS Mavericks. I would buy this laptop or tell my friends this is a great laptop. I'm listening to iTunes and typing this review with 78% battery and I hadn't charged it since yesterday morning. It estimates I will have 10 hours left. That's just amazing. Both of my laptop's batteries would be dead by this morning. Apple just makes great products and they really care about everything from the packaging to the OS. I will never go back to Windows.

Crockett", "ReviewID": "R3FYN4AKV2DCLJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my 13\" MBA for a month and am using it to replace an iPad, whose virtues are considerable but I decided I wanted a more conventional laptop for reasons I will detail below.With an upgrade to Mavericks, my new MBA's software is current, but I should note I opted for the low-end machine since I wanted maximum battery life and minimal weight. I was taken by claims of a PC magazine review which claimed 12-14 hours of battery life for the new MBA. I wanted all-day battery life so I would not have to bring the charger along (or so I wouldn't panic when I forgot it). It does that, though there have been a couple of close calls when I do 15-hour days. I was struck by the positive review in this specific publication--in fact it rated the MacBook Pro higher than 9 other Windows machines ([...] Perhaps we can get past the silly PC-Mac wars of yesteryear: according to PC Magazine, Apple builds top-drawer laptops.The 13\" MBA has longer battery life and a back-lit display, as well as the larger screen. My wife has an 11\" MBA but that did not interest me.  I would have liked the \"Retina\" display, which is not currently available in the Air, but not at the price of reduced battery life. It will be a while, I suspect, before we can get 15-hour battery life, Retina-display quality in the monitor, and the lighter elegance of the Air in one package. My iPad was a \"Retina\" model and therefore it had a better display. So you might choose an iPad Air over the Mac Book Air for that reason. But I wanted the larger screen and the accurate rendering of web pages, in a conventional browser such as Chrome, for the computer science courses I teach, hence my choice.I was surprised in a Monday night course I teach, consisting mainly of business students, that about 70% had Mac laptops--breaking the stereotype. A couple were running Windows using Parallels and commented, \"Macs make very good Windows machines!\" Macs are generally more expensive but also seem to be better made, more reliable and hold their resale better. At least that has been my experience over 25 years of teaching computer science. I still have a high regard for HP, but it's facing a Windows market that suppresses margins that are needed for quality R&D; and production. I regret that, particularly for a company with HP's storied history.All in all, I am well pleased with my purchase and recommend it to all Mac OS (and Windows) users.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hands down the best laptop on the market", "Author": "Eddie B.", "ReviewID": "R2FVEA4J4CSLIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an IT professional, been developing websites going on 8 years and program for a few companies. I am also a full time college student returning to college in a few weeks a Penn State University.With that being said, I know everything about computers. Long story short - I have a very high end custom built water cooked Windows desktop. I love it, but I also like having a portable laptop for certain situations as well as a back up computer. Amongst this, many of my work partners/customers use Mac, and often I cannot test and see things they do. A few years ago I had a Macbook Pro on lease from my old college and loved it. After shopping around in the laptop markets (as well as owning about four laptops in the past already), I decided to go Apple.I ordered mine from Apple.com, not Amazon. But mine was custom ordered, 13\" screen with the Intel Core i7 upgrade. Another reason I ordered it direct from Apple which I recommend to others - beings I'm a college student, I was able to get a $50 discount, $100 giftcard for app's, and the CPU upgrade was $10 cheaper!The pros:- Mountain Lion OSX, compared to Leopard which I last used is a nice step up and upgrade- Fantastic camera with great picture quality- Great screen, nice and bright- Lightweight, sold aluminum body-  Quiet keyboard with backlighting- EXTREMELY FAST boot up time (faster than my custom desktop which has a Corsair Force GT SSD)`Great magsafe power adapter still the best power adapter for laptops on the marketThe Cons- No DVD drive- Wish it had a HDMI output instead of forcing me to buy the firewire adapter- Great speakers but sound quality could be a tad better- Wish there was a 15\" screen optionThe cons are very easily overlooked. This is a fantastic laptop. If you want THE BEST, this is it. Lightweight, portable, and ridiculous battery life that last all day and charges full in a couple hours. The i7 does run a little hotter if you choose that version, but it's not that bad and only runs hot if you are running alot of applications or anything.COMPETITIONI compared this to several new touch-screen models of the Windows 8 tablets. To be honest, I had Windows 8 on another laptop of mine. I hated it. I also compared this to the Google Chromebook. I was eyeing the Chromebook up for several months because of it's awesome price. But I read many bad reviews on the Chromebook about it's cheap plastic, poor battery life, and other anomalies.FINAL THOUGHTSThis laptop is worth the price. It's awesome. I love all the interfaces out there. Linux, Unix, Windows, and Mac OSX. Personally, I think Mac hit the nail on the head with laptops. I think their desktops are outrageously overpriced (in terms of the hardware) and I'm not a fan of the iPad/iPHone and other apple products. But I love the laptops. Lastly, if it wasn't for the lack of support for certain games/applications, I would consider dropping Windows completely for Mac OSX. The operating system is great. It's so much more friendly and intuitive than windows.  Yes, it IS unix with a facelift. But Mac is it's own thing, it's got a slightly different architecture and it is a great OS.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing!", "Author": "Aggietoker", "ReviewID": "R3T3Y4HDQXMIST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been waiting for the 4th Gen. intel CPU to purchase a macbook. This is my first Mac ever and I picked up on it almost intuitively as if I had always used Mac OS X! I wanted the increased battery life that the new intel processor grants (Thank you Intel!) and the sleek, portable design of the 11 inch air. It's only been a few days and I already love it!I picked up the 11 inch because small and portable is better for me personally, I will use this for office, surfing the web, Netflix, and maybe some casual games. I got my base model (4gb ram/i5/128gb) for $899 so it was a great deal! This air is replacing my Ipad 4, after years of using an Ipad (since it's original launch) and loving it, I now find myself needing more of a full fledged laptop but I still wanted the day long battery life that laptops couldn't offer (until now!) and I didn't want another windows laptop.Battery: Why not start with the high point of this generation, let me just say WOW! I cranked out 9 hours and 12 minutes (at about 60% brightness, blutetooth off, and wifi on) on my first complete charge while surfing the web and taking notes in office. I have been waiting for this kind of battery life for a long time and I'm glad it's finally here! Looking forward to Maverick and hopefully even more battery life!Heat/Fan: I've been on it for about 2 hours now typing this up while taking notes in class and It's barley warm. The only time i've heard the fan kick in was while playing portal 2 and it's very quiet!Screen: I'm sad that the resolution didn't get an upgrade but it looks just fine and I would not personally trade off battery life for more PPI, maybe in the next refresh! It's crisp and looks great for what it is which is fine with me. After using a retina screen for almost a year, I do not find it difficult or even consider the downgrade in PPI an issue.Performance: The biggest point here is that Intel made a much more efficient chip with just about equal performance of the previous gen of cpus which is awesome and it should be no surprise to find out that there is no noticeable performance difference between the 2013 and previous air model. No it's not as powerful as something you can get for about the same for windows BUT that's the reason I wanted a Mac, because it's not windows so that argument is null to me. That being said it's plenty powerful for what I use it for.Sound: sounds just fine to me, I wish the sound was a little fuller but I have no quarrels with it.SSD/RAM: Makes everything smooth and seamless.I purchased the 128gb which is perfect since I use cloud storage like dropbox a lot and have a 128gb USB 3.0 stick that is insanely fast. I kind of wish I had 8gb of ram instead of 4gb just because I'm that kind of techie however I know that I won't utilize it. I realize some people need more storage space but there are other good options for those on a budget or who don't think they need extra space and later find themselves short. I do wish it had an SD slot like the 13inch however it wasn't worth the increased size for me.Graphics: The new Intel 5000 is a very nice upgrade from the previous Gen. So far the only game I've played on it is portal 2 and it looks great and plays smoothly (sorry I don't have FPS). From what I've read though, many games run very playable at med to high settings. It's not designed to be a gpu powerhouse but it handles most games pretty well and I'm very happy with that. It does get very warm after a while (1+ hours of gaming) however this is to be expected. It took about 30 mins for me to notice the fan turn on while playing portal 2. The front facing camera is 720p but it looks great and works well enough for me.Design: It didn't change from the previous Gen. but since i've never used a MacBook before; I have large manly hands but I find the keyboard very comfortable, I find that the layout and spacing is perfect for me! The weight and sleek design is excellent for the size IMO. I love the backlit keyboard (which is a MUST imo for all laptops) and the ability to control how long it's on when not typing is awesome (as opposed to simply turning it on and off like my last windows laptop).Overall: I love it, it's not perfect for everyone but it's everything I want and need and it does it all very well. I like that MacBooks hold their value pretty well (something I did not know existed in the laptop market which tells you all you need to know about windows laptops). Perhaps the ONLY disappointment I have is the fact that the SSD and RAM can't be upgraded due to it being integrated into the MB.

I travel a lot for work so I wanted something small so I could take both my personal and work laptop on business trips. Others in my family have the Macbook Pro. I went with the Air mainly for the portability, thin size, and weight of the Air. But the long battery life is what really sold me in the end. As far as choosing between the Air and Pro:- Everything is wireless now so I didn't need the physical network connection.- I bought a USB 3.0 hub to get additional USB ports.- I also go an external HDD for backups and movies, plus I got an external DVD writer.The SSD disk drive is really nice. New programs install in a matter of seconds. I have found everything quick and snappy, in general. Much better than my Windows 7 Lenovo.Other than the excellent battery, I think my most favorite thing is how cool this thing runs. My work Lenovo runs hot and I need a laptop pad to keep from sweating. Even with the pad, that thing still gets me hot when sitting with my feet up and the laptop in the lap. This new Air is hardly even warm. I always use it without the pad and have no issues. It really is a night and day difference.This is just a nice and sleek machine all the way around.

I've had chronic problems with it ever since, but each time I take it in, they put a bandaid on the issue and run the software and hardware tests- never finding anything, and yet things KEEP going wrong.

I bought this laptop to replace my aging Asus U6 laptop running Windows Vista.  I decided on the Macbook Air because I also own an iPhone and iPad, and wanted to own a Mac notebook to complement my i-devices, and fully move over to the Mac ecosystem.  I'm going to review the MacBook Air in several aspects and then provide an overall review.Build Quality: 10/10. Extremely well built, and doesn't feel flimsy at all despite the thin and light design.  Coming from a Asus laptop that was 4.6lbs, this one feels light as a feather.  There are essentially changes to the build design compared to the 2011 and 2012 models.  The one physical feature that is different are the dual stereo mics versus the single mic, which noticeably improved background noise cancelling during calls, and helps improve the accuracy of the dictation feature.Power: 8/10. The 2013 Macbook Air packs the latest Haswell processors from Intel which promises improved graphics and better power management (more details in battery life review). This is the perfect laptop I've wanted for everyday use. If you are looking for video editing intense gaming, I believe the MacBook Pro would be more suitable.  For everyday use such as web browsing, Office computing and video chatting, the Air is great.Battery Life: 10/10.  This is the key feature that convinced me to finally upgrade my existing laptop.  The new MacBook Air boasts up to 9 hours of battery life, up from 5 hours in the 2012 models.  After using the MacBook Air for a day, it has certainly delivered on the promise!  My old Asus laptop only lasted 2 hours at max, so I am definitely very happy about the longer battery life.Screen: 8/10.  With the release of the Retina MacBook Pros, I can't rate this a solid 10/10, even though to me the screen looks perfectly fine.  The viewing angles are incredible.  I find myself having to adjust the lid much more infrequently compared to my old Asus laptop.Sound: 8/10. When the volume is maxed, I felt that the sound was adequate.  A cool design feature is that the speakers are actually underneath the keyboard, yet the speakers are still very impressively loud and clear sounding.Expansion: 4/10. Both RAM and hard drive are not user replaceable.  Make sure you choose the desired configuration for the RAM and SSD at the time of purchase!  My rationale for choosing the 4GB RAM and 128GB configuration is that 4GB is sufficient for everyday usage (not video editing or intense gaming), and I will be using the MacBook Air at home most of the time, so my external hard drive is readily available.Overall: 10/10.  Despite scores that were lower than 10 in some of the individual components, overall I feel that the MacBook Air is the perfect everyday device, and there is no other notebook that better suits my needs.  In terms of build design, battery life, portability, this notebook delivers.

They work flawlessly and the customer service and technical support are exceptional.  I have literally five PC laptops, all from the same manufacturer - a well known brand.  And while I would buy another one from this manufacturer if I was to ever get another PC, there is no way I could ever do that to myself or my clients.  Why?1. Mac's boot up quickly and consistently.  I had a one year old PC laptop in great condition.  From the time I booted up the computer to the time the document loaded into my email, 7 minutes passed!  On my Mac, it's about 30 seconds, even the one that's over a year old.  No issues over time.2. Battery life - PC battery life is about 2 hours maximum. I get 3 times that and more from my Mac, even one that I've had for over a year.3. Support - got a problem, take it to the Apple Store. I had an issue with the new one.  Took it in and within 8 hours it was diagnosed, fixed, and back in my hands for free.4. Impressive - the impression people get when they see me pull out my Mac is that I mean business, I've stepped up my game, and that I can get the job done.The other day, my wife was complaining about how slow her PC was after a year of ownership.  She was trying to place an order online and couldn't.  I gave her my Mac to try; within 2 minutes, she had the order completed.  It was her computer, not the website.So, if you want a computer that is problem free, impressive, and just simply works, get a Mac.  If you don't have enough stress in your life and have plenty of time to sit and wait, then get a PC.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for daily usage, but also for Djing!", "Author": "Erico", "ReviewID": "R257EUVK2THB3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is just incredible!I bought it to work with some of my personal projects, being one of them djing.

Multi-touch functions are useful.- Lots of accessories are available (cases, keyboard protectors, skins)- Excellent support and service*Cons- Display lacks detail (lower resolution than many of other options in the market)- Heat issues (especially when watching Netflix, etc.) - not enough cooling power. After 30 minutes of video-watching, the laptop becomes hot near the upper part of the keyboard. The performance does not seem to be affected.- Limited peripheral ports (no HDMI, no VGA, only two USB ports, no security lock ports...)- Power button is part of the keyboard, which is a little odd- Speaker is only mediocre.- Currently cannot run Windows through boot camp due to the hardware being too new.The battery lasted around 8 hours during normal internet use and about 3.5 hours for Netflix.Note:If you are a student, you can get the educational pricing from Apple. $1049 for the 128gb version plus $100 app store gift card during the Back to School promotion.I personally purchased this mac from Best Buy because they were offering a $100 discount for students (you can Google and find a coupon) - I believe this promotion ends near the end of July", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "I never thought I would like an Apple product", "Author": "Anthony Francis \"savaticus\"", "ReviewID": "R26QFA9A5VTAK5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have a pretty strong hatred of Apple and their business practices.

I eventually got used to it, but I was still happy to have an excuse for getting a lighter laptop. Returning to Apple, I can see that there are things I prefer about both platforms. I really can't wait for Chromebooks to get more established, because I imagine I'll ultimately prefer those to Windows or MAC so there's that.As for this device, I mostly love it. The screen goes dark for no reason once in a while, which makes me wonder if I should return it or see if the Apple store will do anything about it even though I got Squaretrade instead of Applecare. The device itself is very nice. I can't really think of much I'd criticize about. In particular, the trackpad is good as Apple's trackpads always are. I just find Apple to be very controlling and sometimes I get annoyed because there are so many limits to customization. Also, I got some cheap plastic cover for it, and it looks amazing. It makes me smile when I use it, just because it's so pretty.I wonder if I spent too much money on this, but I spent just as much money on that stupid Lenovo, which continues to give me headache after headache...EDIT: The one thing I've noticed though is that it's constantly dropping the wi-fi and not wanting to reconnect to the same signal.

This is a little bit of a Windows rant but I figure it might be useful for people looking into a new PC/Laptop.The main reasons are as follows:1) I need full disk encryption.  I want to protect personal data in case the computer falls into the wrong hands . I believe this is something every laptop should have, possibly every desktop.  Otherwise if I lose my laptop, anyone can get all my family pictures, bank statements etc.  To have this feature with the previous (relatively new) computer I needed Windows 7 Ultimate or Windows 7 Professional. W7-Pro does not have it.  I had Windows 7 Pro.  So I upgraded to W8 Pro via employer provided license.  What a huge mistake.  Windows 8 is the worst operating system I have seen in many years.  Even early Linux was friendlier.  Ugly design, confusing , settings all over the place, split personality, etc.  Then I thought, well , my wife is really used to Windows, so I considered getting a Windows 7 Ultimate license.  Then I found that in order to have full disk encryption you need TPM module in your computer, or you need to boot from USB drive every time.  Mine doesn't have it.  I considered Tru-Crypt, but I will not install a software that I have no idea who writes it and very few smart people in the world are able to build from source.2) I want easy back-ups.  Time machine is really hard to beat in ease of use.  Plug in a USB drive, you're done.For some people the two above reasons might not be relevant, but for me they are.Back to the MBA 11\".What I like:-Solid build.  Aluminum.-Magsafe power connector.  Very easy to plug , unplug. Compact. \"Looks\" safe.  Haven't tried pulling it, but the MBA will probably fly .-USB3, but you can get this on most new laptops.-Thunderbolt is there, even though I use it as mini display port.-Camera is pretty good for what I use it (Skype etc)-It's very light and easy to carry.-I love the size.  Compared to my Macbook Pro 13\", it's much lighter and easier to carry.  If we are going to do serious work we need a bigger screen anyway, so no need to carry a 13\" around (more on the screen below)-Battery life is excellent.-Runs pretty cool, so far.-Mac OS has a consistent user interface (on par with W7, but much better than W8)-Airport Mirroring.  Mirror almost anything to the AppleTV if you have one.-Full easy-to-use full disk encryption (FileVault 2)-Instant on as you open the lid.-Time machine painless backups (and encrypted as well).-Bundled software (iPhoto, iMovie etc)-Cheap upgrades (OS X)-Backlit keyboard-Very secure OS.  Don't even need an antivirus if you use common sense.-No bloatware. Default install is clean, no propaganda slowing down or confusing you.-You can choose the language.-Only one OS.  No Starter vs Pro vs Ultimate nonsense.What I don't like:- The screen is OK but I think Apple could fit a slightly larger screen in the same space.  The metal frame around the screen is pretty thick.- Not a fan of shiny screens, prefer matte.- Kind of expensive.  For this price it could have at least longer warranty.Overall a great notebook.

I was extremely impressed with the 4 second startup time and the 9 hr battery life. It also wakes up after going into sleep mode. His laptop is easily as fast as the macbook air if not faster. But the deal breaker for me was that the acer is 1/5th the price of the macbook air. I ended up returning the mac and bought the acer and I've been thrilled. It can't do everything the mac can do but it does about 98% of what I was doing on the mac so for me it's perfect. I'm knocking 1 star for the sleep issue and 2 more for the inflated price.

This may happen 2-3 times in a row, and each time it takes at least 30-45 seconds for the computer to turn back on. I just get a black screen with a mouse cursor button and unable to get any response by pressing any buttons, including the power button. Just have to sit there and wait for the computer to come back from the ether...Second issue is the keyboard - although the thinness is pretty incredible and great for portability, this is the LEAST ergonomically designed computer I've ever used! After less than a minute of typing on this super flat keyboard, my wrists are KILLING me and I'm young! It physically hurts to keep my hands on the keyboard - the chassis is far too thin - the distance between the edge of the computer to the start of the keyboard is literally 1.5x longer than any other laptop - so almost half my forearm rests on the computer in order to type. I should only have to put my wrists and hands on the computer to type. I end up using my horrible, clunky Lenovo work computer to do any serious typing or even gchatting with friends because it's just not worth it physically to me to do anything but browse the net or watch videos on this thing. The pain is too much.Finally, the newly designed power adaptor SUCKS. You so much as look at the thing, and it falls out. You cannot use the laptop in your lap while it's plugged in because the power cord falls out of the side of the thing. It's seriously the worst design I've ever seen. I guess Apple doesn't think you should use laptops in your lap unless they're fully charged. The only redeeming quality is the batter life is long enough where I can afford to use it unplugged in my lap for a few hours.

The third was purchased from Amazon. I got three bad apples, and I think that about sums it up. I will try purchasing this machine in the next couple of years in hopes that I don't strike out again (I'm a sucker for a good product and I believe that Apple still can provide that).I imagine the issue I originally encountered, that I gave this product 1 star for, was simply a defect in manufacturing. I own an early 2011 MacBook Pro that I love. I am (was?) an avid Apple fan and I purchased the newest Air recently. I opened it up only to find that the screen was lopsided. The case seems to close with the left side coming down every so slightly sooner than the right, which makes the whole body of the computer lopsided. When the laptop is closed, you can see that one side is a fraction of a millimeter tighter than the other.As an academic and type-A person who spends a great deal of time on her machine, this is unacceptable. When I drop a grand on a piece of equipment, it had better be perfect. I didn't think Apple could disappoint, but it did. I (exchanged) this first computer and (opened) the next one in the store before leaving. Hopefully no one else encounters this problem and Amazon will allow your return if you do.Edit 6/25: The tech at the Apple store was incredulous at first, but when he saw the gap difference he willingly replaced it. My understanding is that I am not the only individual who encountered this. The replacement does not have the same issue; I now have an excellent computer to use for work and school and am pleased so far with how things are working. I'm not incredibly computer savvy, and this is the first Air I have owned, but for someone who needed something light, small, and fast, this fits the bill. Still annoyed (and very surprised) that the first go was a bust.Edit 7/13: The second computer, after a couple days of use, began to randomly go black. Nothing would be lost, nothing to indicate why this was happening. The screen would just go dark and I would have to wait five to ten seconds for it to turn back on and all would be like it was just before the screen went dark. Kind of like an old person nodding off while watching TV and then suddenly waking up. I did trouble shoot with Apple. No hot spots on, nothing amiss. I took it back to the store; they offered to replace it. Instead, I washed my hands of the new toy and decided to wait a while to see if this issue got resolved. I was so disappointed.Then, I saw the computer go on sale at amazon for the student discount price at apple, without tax, on the 10th of July. It felt too soon, but that was a great price. I had a nice chunk of change in points and gift cards with Amazon and thought- what the heck. I bought it again, thinking there was absolutely NO possible way I could experience an issue a THIRD time.Of course, the screen on this computer was lopsided as well, like the first one. Not as severe as the first computer, but bad enough that I sent it back to Amazon today.I give up, Apple. I want to love your newer products. I really, really do. But it seems like there are some serious quality control issues and bugs that need to be resolved, and I don't want to cope with those, despite my desire for a new computer (fortunately I don't necessarily need a new one right now). I hope my old pro will last me a couple more years.

A $250 netbook can provide similar functionality.-the battery is not replaceable easily. So it's not feasible to have an extra battery on hand. And another thing: these batteries degrade over time. All batteries do. So your 10 hour battery will be a 5 hour, then a 3 hour battery at some point. Another issue is whether hackers can access your machine when it is turned off, the way they can with an Iphone. Yes, you can replace it by opening the case, but this is not a positive selling point.-Apple hard disks have been failing at a high rate. This means that you have to buy a back-up system and use it. TIP: When (if) you take your macbook in for a HD replacement, make sure to specify you want the old hard drive back. A. has not been returning these, and I had to call Cupertino over this to get mine back.-Apple will try to sell you warranty coverage over the phone.

Are you going on a moon launch? Get real.
