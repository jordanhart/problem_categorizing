It was brand new, I'm the one that actually cut open the box. I had him upgrade the RAM from 4GB to 8GB, and it flies! I recommend this computer for anyone looking for a nice, stable computer. Upgrade the RAM if you get a chance and just sit back and enjoy! I usually don't write reviews on Amazon if I didn't buy it on Amazon, but this computer is worth it. The best laptop I've had since my last Acer in 2009. I have since had a Toshiba and Sony, also both good computers. This is just what I've wanted for, not only speed, but convenience, as this is a lighter laptop then the rest have been.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Laptop for my needs", "Author": "JKaczynski", "ReviewID": "R2XIG6TBXRR0ZP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just purchased this laptop recently and I am really happy with it. Build quality seems very solid. the lid is glossy but the inside around the keyboard and track pad are not which is nice, as far as I can tell it doesn't get smear marks like the gloss.The Intel core i3 processor seems to have the speed I need. I am able to run all the desktop applications that I use on my desktop which has an Intel core i7 in it.The integrated Intel HD 4000 performs well in video situations such as Youtube and Hulu, I haven't had any issues. I tried Minecraft, Portal 2 and varies other low end games on this system. Minecraft runs about 20 FPS and Portal 2 runs awesome with all the settings as high as they can go. Considering this is not a gaming system I think that's pretty good and works well for light gaming.I like that the system supports up to 8GB of memory.One thing I don't care for as an IT Tech, the BIOS is locked down. I can only change a few settings. The BIOS is called insydeh20, I feel if that is installed there should at least be a way to disable it.Last note: there is no Bluetooth which I actually thought all laptops had.Overall this is a solid system and has some nice features to go with it. This is an excellent system for my needs.One note, setting the supervisor password for the BIOS allows you to change a few extra settings.", "Date": "February 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price, it's not bad.  But it does have its drawbacks.", "Author": "igen \"igen\"", "ReviewID": "RBAESXH41BXAC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I specifically bought this laptop for my wife to use for our small business because it was rated the #2 most reliable Windows laptop by Soluto in their 2013 reliability study (outdone only by a MacBook that cost more than twice as much--and which probably didn't clock nearly as much time running Windows as this Acer).What I like:- rated #2 most reliable Windows laptop in Soluto's 2013 reliability study- inexpensive- fastest CPU in its price range (according to CPUbenchmark.net)- power cord has a right-angle plug on the laptop end- speakers, though mediocre, are at least audible in a household environment and are better than I've had on past entry-level laptops- not overly bulky or heavy- decent battery lifeWhat I don't like:- hard drive is extremely slow, even compared to other spindle-based laptop drives (a faster hard drive or SSD would be a welcome upgrade)- touchpad buttons require too much force to click (they're not horribly stiff, but they did cause my thumb's existing repetitive stress injury to fire up again)- touchpad performance is inconsistent- glossy screen- low resolution (1280x768)- keyboard could be better- power connector on the laptop is wobbly (might be prone to failure...but I guess we'll see)- wireless connection is flaky (disconnects periodically, but turning WiFi off and back on always seems to fix it)- comes with some crapware/bloatware preinstalledThe bottom line:Unfortunately there are too many negatives for me to say I like this laptop out-of-the-box.  If you need a cheap, no-frills laptop and you're on a strict budget, then this is probably the best entry-level laptop you'll find based on the specs and Soluto's reliability study, but it does have its flaws.  If you're willing to spend $200 or so upgrading the RAM and replacing the hard drive with an SSD, you're probably better off stepping up to a slightly higher-end model with a touchscreen and more RAM (such as Acer's V5 series), and upgrading that laptop's hard drive to an SSD.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop for high-end applications and moderate gaming", "Author": "AMunozC", "ReviewID": "R2LXVM27041FUD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I seldom provide reviews and I bought this laptop some place else.Overall, I am very pleased with the product. This is an excellent laptop for someone in need of high performance and efficiency at the cost of overall design and other fluff. I paid a bit more than this current price and still have no regrets. There is ample room for multi-tasking applications with this laptop.Pros:Its fast and powerful Intel Core i3 2.4GHz processor is able to run the daily graphic design programs (Photoshop, InDesign) I use on top of Windows 8 and several other applications.With the innate 4GB memory, some heavy games such as The Lord of the Rings Online and Star Wars the Old Republic run quite smoothly and at high graphics settings thanks to its also powerful Intel HD Graphics with up to 1760MB dynamic video memory.The long-lasting 6 cell LI-ion battery lasts about 3 hours running heavy applications on High Performance battery setting and almost 6 hours running standard business operations on Balanced battery setting.Expandable to over 8GB of memory and the 500GB (450GB to be honest) HDD drive is very fast as well.Nice HDMI port and card reader.Cons:The keyboard design has a lot to desire. More separation between the alpha and numeric pads would be great.Windows 8 desktop panels are shambles. A simple download of the \"Start Menu 8\" application fixed this.There is no Numlock, Capslock, ScrollLock, FN indicator on the laptop. This is a huge flaw in user interaction design.The sound...is awfully low. It is still low even after tweaking the sound settings. External speakers/headphones are needed.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product!", "Author": "Taylor Mead", "ReviewID": "RWHF76O1F5WVZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my new acer!
