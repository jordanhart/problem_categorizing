{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Service, Great Laptop (with one caveat)", "Author": "Creed J Smith", "ReviewID": "R30NGCUZD2L4QU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the 240GB SSD & 1.5TB HD + 16GB RAM configuration.I received this laptop last week and have been very happy with it.  I previously had an HP Envy TouchSmart 15 that I bought from Costco but I returned it because it was seriously underpowered.  Still I was happy with the sleek design and compact form factor of the Envy model.  I was looking for something compact and powerful but also stays cool.  This model has those features and more.Eluktronics shipped the computer quickly but it still took a few days to arrive.  The computer was packaged effectively for shipping.I am happy with the computer although I've yet to utilize all of the features.One item of note- if you open the BIOS during boot (which I did to disable the annoying \"Action Keys\" mode) then you will be  temporarily unable to boot the computer.  Apparently this is common laptops with an HDD as the secondary drive and the mSATA drive as the primary.  I contacted Eluktroniks with this issue and they promptly responded and helped me resolve the problem.  Essentially the problem is related to the computer resetting the primary hard drive/boot device after BIOS is loaded.I was advised to:1.Remove the battery/power supply and open the consumer upgradeable components.  There is a single screw underneath the battery, I just unscrewed that and gently lifted the single tab where the screw is located and the other tabs released easily.2.Remove the HDD (not the SSD),3.Replace battery/power supply and power on the computer and log in4 Shut down the computer and remove battery/power supply again5.Replace the HDD and plastic cover6.Replace battery/power supply and power on the computer and log in again.7.Restart one last timeAfter following those steps I was able to use the computer again with no problems.  This is a minor issue in my opinion and did not affect my rating.I would recommend this laptop and seller!", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far no major issues", "Author": "Ranil", "ReviewID": "R1QYDXT1AGN54W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I read some complaints about this laptop being  a cheap looking one given the price range. I bought the one with 16 RAM, 4GB Cache for Nvidia Gforce graphic card, 1TB SSD and 1TB Hybrid memory.The touch screen is not he best and the graphics are not mind blowing but the monster like performance is there as you would expect given its specs. For some reason the screen got stuck when I was browsing Google maps. Very disappointed about this when I have such a good graphic card. I feel it is the cheap touch screen. The screen is flimsy as well - when you move your figure behind applying some force you can see the trace on your screen. It is not as bad it sounds but sends a warn about leaving this laptop on chairs o around kids.The HP finger print scanner is pretty good but at the same time the safe pass software is a pain given it every time you try to log on to account it asks to remember the password irrespective of whether you have rejected it before. There is another HP feather that monitors laptop movement and make sure the bottom temperature does not increase much by controlling the performance. It was handy so far but not sure I would like to compromise performance for that.The key board where you rest your hand is very solid but the area where you have the keys is like a spring board - I saw a Youtube video showing how bad the keyboard is when typing - they sink in as you type and usually you miss some letters here and there.I hate Windows8 start menu and I have to scroll down to get more normal menu.The sounds would have been louder.I am yet get more us of it. Have not tested enough. I may update review if I see a need.", "Date": "April 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "quick and capable service by Eluktronics", "Author": "BAI C FENG", "ReviewID": "R2M7P1WKNY947M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought Envy 15t-j100 from Eluktronics via Amazon on line in Sept. 2013. The unit was upgraded with 240 GB ssd, 16 GB memory and 1T HD. For two months, it ran properly with all functions and operating speed was really fast. Then suddenly, windows tile screen disappeared, when pc was turned on. The screen showed only desktop and HP simplepass did not work. I contacted HP and used few updates according to their instruction. All measures failed, including BIOS reset, refresh, recovery to factory condition etc. Finally the pc was returned to HP for repair. HP said, the problem was caused by SSD. They removed SSD and reset the pc.I called Eluktonics. They immediately send me a return label. The pc was quickly repaired and returned to me. 240 GB ssd was re-installed without any problem. Since then(about two months),the pc has run properly. I am convinced that Eluktronis is technically capable for upgrading PC and provide quick response and service. I recommend Elutronics to my friends and people who need upgraded PC.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Quick Shipment", "Author": "Ravi Post \"Ravi\"", "ReviewID": "R3S200D1ZNOQ16", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Eluktronics shipped myHP Envy 15t-j100 with 16GB RAM, 240 SSD and 1.5TB on the same day.Before purchase I went to their website and found the number and called them to get details, they were very knowledgeable and explained how they do customization, they are resellers or HP and authorized for customization and we still keep HP warranty.There was one Windows update swapped drive letter for SSD and Harddisk and I called their customer support, they helped with the problem, now I enjoy this new notebook PC.PROS: High speed boot, touch screen, doesn't heat up, back lite keyboard, finger print reader, loud speakers.CONS: Only the center body is Aluminum, top cover and bottom cover are made of standard notebook plastic material, the display is not that crisp as the previous non-touch LED displays, but still good. Battery life is average, approx. 4.5 hours.Overall I am enjoying my new Notebook PC.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good laptop.", "Author": "Electro Geek", "ReviewID": "R1COKER7DH0SWF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop rivals the MacBook Pro.
