Durable design, ultra mobile, more port's and expansions than most know what to do with. The handle is awesome, lets me know that hopefully they will take care of the 8K In computer's I purchased. Fast and to the point my guy's love them. Ill also add that not all of my technicians are computer savvy, but they picked this up just fine! What really made my decision was that I could still purchase it with windows 7! Teaching old guy's new tricks with windows 8 is becoming a bear.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Keith", "ReviewID": "R2LIN7OMOS72W3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work out of my truck, and have made the mistake of using \"Cheaper Computers\" in the past, I have used the Toughbook for a couple of months now, and it is awesome. it is sturdy, fast and professional looking.
