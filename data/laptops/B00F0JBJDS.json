{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Laptop", "Author": "Nick", "ReviewID": "R3IG7V4CBGJYRF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of people have been giving many laptops bad reviews because of their hatred for windows 8. With the Windows 8.1 update, they have made quite a few improvements, making it a whole lot better of an experience. But as for this laptop in particular, it is fantastic.There aren't many laptops in this price range with such great specs as well as coming from a highly accredited laptop brand. The 8 gigs of ram and intel i7 processor make actions buttery smooth, and startup time extremely fast. The i7 also is a necessity for anybody looking for a laptop with interest in extensive video editing or 3D modeling. I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a laptop in the $700 price range. The only downfall of this computer is the lack of a touchscreen, but that isn't all that much of a big deal, and for some people not a big deal at all.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Good Laptop for the Price", "Author": "Jonathan Grabis", "ReviewID": "RLAC6PCME2084", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like almost everything about this laptop.  It had just about the perfect combination of features I was looking for at a very reasonable price.  Only downsides are the screen resolution (I knew that would not be a premium feature going into the purchase) and the keyboard has a tendency to skip letters if you are not a forceful typist.  My silver lining here is that the machine is retraining me to be a more decisive key tapper.  Fourth gen i7 is fast and handles all my tasks with ease.  Battery life is good, roughly 4.5 hours under normal use.  Trackpad works well with gestures and very responsive overall.  Machine stays cool even under moderate load (multitasking, video playback).  I don't even have anything bad to say about the Windows 8.  I migrated to this machine from an old white Macbook and its been a tremendous upgrade.  I decided to go with Windows since Apple has been consistently disappointing on their recent hardware releases.  Happy with my decision and I recommend this laptop if your usage is going to be moderate graphic work but mainly general office, data analysis use.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "fast and good value; I7, 8mb, 1tb memory, a lot for the money", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3K68SQB3ADGK6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "really fast, once the boatloads of junkware are removed; a touchscreen would be a lot nicer with W8 and for general home/family use, but for Office-based programs, and especially for Dragon dictation, works very well; I'm tempted to go back to W7", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop to fit my style and needs", "Author": "T. Kim", "ReviewID": "R3KM53E2VE89J5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a laptop with a full keyboard (including a keypad so I could type accents more easily), a matte screen for easier outdoor use, a large screen, and a fairly decent amount of power for a decent price.For its price, it is fairly thin. It stays fairly cool even if I'm playing Team Fortress 2, which runs very smoothly on the laptop although the laptop lacks a dedicated graphics card. In terms of battery life, on the power-saving settings it lasts for a decent-length flight. The sound quality is pretty clear.I will note that the total memory is listed as a terabyte, which is actually achieved by having two hard disk drives, so there might be some disk-drive switching lag when accessing files on the other disk drive. The ethernet port has a small hinge to expand to fit the actual plug, which might present a possible weak point that could break off later on. Only the top cover and keyboard surface have metal plating; the border of the screen and the bottom are entirely plastic, though this hasn't presented any heating problems yet. The trackpad I'm not a fan of. I avoid using tap-to-click, and the actual clicking mechanism of the trackpad doesn't always work as well as I'd like it to. Initially, some of the keys were also a little unresponsive (I'm looking at you, \"u\"), but this seems to have gotten better over time. Also, there was a fair amount of ASUS bloatware but nothing hard to remove.Overall, this is a very solid laptop, and for anyone who isn't too keen on technical details but wants a laptop that can handle games, do work, and stay classy, I would definitely recommend this laptop.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Product for a Great Price", "Author": "Daniel Kalski", "ReviewID": "RQ9PNWGDLSKVV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product is not only built well, but works perfectly. I don't understand why people are giving awful reviews on this product, but it works like a charm. After a few updates for the computer, free update to Windows 8.1, it becomes a nice working machine.The speed of the computer is fast, the graphics are decent, and the multitasking is incredible. This laptop is something for everyone.

I have had this one a month and 2 keys have fallen off. Service says that I have to send it in for service and it could take 2-4 weeks. I use this for work and don't expect a one month old computer to have to be out for service. Second issue is he WIFI which continually drops connections. The internet is loaded with complaints on this but their technical support seems clueless in resolving it. I have re-installed drivers, rolled back drivers, tried hard coding a IP address and every other suggestion of the support people and nothing resolved the problem.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love how sleek it feels!

There is no question that it is fast! It has 1 terabyte of hard disk storage space NOTE: this is achieved with 2 separate HDD in the machine, but it does not seem to be a problem. The keyboard definitely feels pliable and this computer does not get hot (at least for me so far). The only thing that this laptop lacks is a touchscreen and a dedicated graphics card, although I'm pretty sure with the I7 and the 8 gb of ram it will be plenty fast enough to handle light gaming. And as for the touchscreen, I honestly would say Windows 8 is much better with a touchscreen, but that is only if you want to pay $1000 and up.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "I would buy another Asus", "Author": "Jeffrey Eisenmann", "ReviewID": "RNKMFGBWDQ1M0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is very nice machine, I like the quality better than the leading 2 PC mfrs.

Rolland \"RAR\"", "ReviewID": "R2SMJ0EVW8VJPZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My wife picked this one out (with some help) to be her new computer. We wanted the memory and the large harddrive.Turns out the drive is preformatted into a C: Operation and D: Data drives. I have found in the past that the \"D:\" drive was set up as a system recovery drive. This one is divided in half and as the operating system kind of mandates all the \"document\" folders under the user ID you can't move them to the D: data drive. What a waste. I was really unhappy. An online chat with ASUS tech assist said this was done for security measures and assured me my programs would let me store data on the d: drive. Well, duh. But then what is the point of all that series of folders Windows has preordained \"MY\" stuff anyone.  Other than reformating the drive and reloading Windows 8 which I can't cause they no longer give you a disk(s) we are out of luck. Other than that after a day and a half it is set up with the upgraded Windows 8.1 MS OFFICE, ADOBE products and now I just have to go in and remove all the garbage programs Microsoft put on the computer that are just taking up space AND keep popping up wanting to be bought or used needlessly.R", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mediocre screen", "Author": "Jenna James", "ReviewID": "R23WN1TSG4BC3L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This computer has great specs, which is why I was so surprised that the screen was an average, run-of-the-mill matte screen.

Swift", "ReviewID": "R277JSGSMQ7XHR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been building and repairing computers for 20+ years and in the last 10 years have become quite expert with laptops. My opinion prior to becoming very skilled at all types of laptop repair was that they were all very similar. WRONG!!!There are several brands I wouldn't have even if the price was ZERO - because that is how much I could trust them.The key difference, I believe, is the same for laptops as it is desktops. When you're building a custom computer you need to consider many things that will determine the difference between crap and amazing performance. The first, and most critical decision is the motherboard. I use ASUS motherboards in 98% of ever system I build. That means that I've build with ALL the other brands (all most) at one time or another but I choose ASUS first and most often.It only makes sense that if I love ASUS boards I would choose their brand since it stands to reason they are built on that platform too.I LOVE ASUS LAPTOPS!!!Screens, hard drive, optical drives, etc. - they ARE almost identical across the spectrum of manufacturers so go with the company that holds the key to making a difference. ASUS isn't perfect but their products have proven more reliable and better performing than most and to date, they haven't succumb to the nonsense that some other brands have. Namely, the installing of mountains of CRAPWARE on a brand new system. Nothing chaffs my chaps more than getting a BRAND NEW computer LOADED with GARBAGE!!!I've not ordered 7 ASUS laptops for my use (professional and personal) and recommended them to hundreds of others. They have all performed well.These Ultrabook laptops with full 15.6\" screens are particularly excellent. Mine had no optical drive with a touch screen (I bought an external drive) and this one has an optical with no touchscreen. They are both excellent.Last word - the sins I've seen when I disassemble to repair are far greater in most every other brand. For the price of ASUS equipment and with the long history of customer service and quality from ASUS - I couldn't imagine buying anything else!", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great investment", "Author": "Nadine Collins", "ReviewID": "R2WEIID66UT9MA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop.

The 15.6 inch matte finish screen could use a little higher resolution to properly fit some web pages and email displays, but it's a trade off with cost.

This has nothing to do with Windows 8. Both asus computers I have are Windows 7. Having said that, here is my reposted review.i have two ASUS laptops. They are the worse piece of crap I've ever owned. ASUS makes good motherboards as i have one in my desktop computer and it works great. But both ASUS laptops have had many problems. I sent one into ASUS and it took weeks to get it back. The same problem emerged within a short period of time. ASUS refused to replace the computer with a new one. They will only try to fix the garbage you're stuck with. Both computers were rebooting themselves right in the middle of important work. One has slowed down so much, I finally gave up and ordered a HP laptop. That will be my second HP. I don't work for HP and don't make a dime by mentioning them but the hp laptop I currently have has been working great for four years and has been very stable.
