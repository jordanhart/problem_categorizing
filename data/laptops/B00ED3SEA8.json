The touch screen works well as expected but the mouse sometimes just don't respond. I like the 1TB of HDD and the 8GB of memory allow you to do your works quickly as the computer responds adequately.What I dislike is the impossibility to upgrade to windows 8.1 I spent a couple of days trying to resolve the issue relating to upgrading but none of my attempting has been successful. The screen just goes blank and I wait for hours but nothing. I even installed a windows 8.1 but a few time later everything goes blank. the system does not start up. I've used the RECOVERY MANAGER to get the system back.If anyone knows how to successfully upgrade to windows 8.1, I'll be glad to read your reviews.I really want to experience the latest OS, so don't hesitate to post how this can be possible on HP Envy TouchSmart.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is not a Touch Screen", "Author": "Alberto Morales", "ReviewID": "R3CCTBATZRY2JG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This computer got to me and, it was already with a windows user and it was not a touchscreen I had to send it back.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$692.15", "Features": "2.6GHz 3rd generation Intel Core i5-3230M Processor with Turbo Boost Technology up to 3.2GHz\n15.6-inch diagonal HD BrightView LED-backlit touchscreen display (1366x768)\n8GB DDR3 SDRAM (2 DIMM)\n1TB 5400RPM hard drive with HP ProtectSmart Hard Drive Protection\nWindows 8 (64-bit)", "Name": "HP ENVY TouchSmart 15-j057cl Notebook PC (2.6GHz Intel Core i5-3230M Processor, 8GB DDR3 SDRAM, 1TB 5400RPM hard drive, Windows 8 64-bit)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZxObViYRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ED3SEA8"}}
