{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great portable powerhouse", "Author": "lemergy", "ReviewID": "R2YMDBCUWXN76H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop was exactly what I was looking for as sort of a portable desktop.  The 17 inch screen is a great size to watch media with.  The speakers are amazing and it comes with a plug in sub-woofer.  I think they limited the volume max so you don't blow out the speakers so it's not insanely loud but just great rich sound. The laptop description says it weighs 12 plus pounds which is ridiculous so I weighed it on my kitchen scale and it's only 7.8 pounds.  The mouse pad has many functions and can be frustrating at first but once you get used to the swipe motion function it's pretty useful.  2 gigs of dedicated video ram can handle video editing and play most modern games on medium or higher settings.  It has a small onboard video card to save power until the big guy is needed. The 8 gigs of ram can be upgraded to 16 gigs as the two card slots are not hardwired to the motherboard like some other laptops. All in all it's everything I'll need for the next few years.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "This laptop is a beast!", "Author": "Guillermo Castro", "ReviewID": "RBGDTVTJFQWQT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, first of all I would like to say that English is not my first language, so excuse me if I have some grammatical mistakes. I hope you understand me!The main reason why I bought this PC is for gaming. I just wanted to play every game, at least in low graphics, but I wanted to play them all. I bought it a week ago and I have already tried games such as Farcry 3, Payday 2, Outlast, Minecraft, Skyrim, Black Ops 2.Fow now, I have not any issues. The processor is great, the graphics card as well, and I absolutely love the screen. The only bad thing that I would like to point out is that on the left side of the Laptop, when playing games, it gets hotter than what I expected, but it`s still okay.Something that I would like to recommend is to install the Nvidia graphics card drivers, this problem of the temperature reduces and some games become faster.", "Date": "September 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "The latest technology!", "Author": "H.

Sound and picture are all good.But the thin and weak printings on the each key are not very readable and identifiable.

Moran", "ReviewID": "RRUCIZ1QTWX47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a mobile gaming computer and this delivered. It's a little more powerful than my year old desktop and was only slightly more expensive, which is standard comparing desktops and laptops. I had an easy time taking out the standard RAM and upgrading it to 16GB. It's almost as easy as unscrewing the bottom, popping out the two that are in there and popping in the new stuff. You then have to make sure the computer recognizes it, which was the more difficult part.It can get pretty hot so I'd definitely recommend a cooling fan, especially if you use it for long gaming sessions like I do. The new Windows has a bit of a learning curve but it's nothing terrible. It did have a lot of unnecessary apps and I spent the first few hours just removing pesky stuff that I didn't want on my machine. Otherwise I absolutely love it.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "chance", "Author": "Lorraine C. Cadieux", "ReviewID": "R34RGG9Y0BBWJF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To be honest I had reservations in buying a laptop online.  Not being familiar with the name ASUS, I was very hesitant.  So far, this laptop has performed well, I have no complaints.  I did buy the extended warranty, if things keep working the way they do I wont need to have it.  I would buy another ASUS again.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mostly Excellent", "Author": "Sheeple", "ReviewID": "RCSRNOPD1NSGH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The power of the hardware is amazing. This thing boots so fast. I put the solid state drive from my old laptop into this new beast and it boots so fast it makes my head spin!However...I don't like this keyboard. I just didn't realize, based on the pictures, that it was that type of keyboard you find on Macs. The keys are all spaced out. I hate this. they're small squares and i mistype often. Keys just aren't where i expect them to be.The touchpad is horrible. It's too sensitive. The ASUS driver lets you enable features, but doesn't let you configure the sensitivity. I constantly try two finger scroll and accidentally do the right click menu because they're similar gestures.I can't use the left or right hardware click on the touchpad. On synaptic touchpads, you can configure the area of the touchpad that will respond to touch. if this were available for this touchpad, i would tell it to NEVER REGISTER TOUCH near the part of the touchpad that contains the left and right click.I'm happy with the power, but i regret the keyboard and the mouse on this thing. I wish i hadn't bought this, and that's tough to say because i am a pretty happy guy when it comes to ASUS products.", "Date": "October 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really Great Computer, Windows 8 is the Wrong OS for It", "Author": "Xochimilco, Esq.", "ReviewID": "R2JXC3JORNXX67", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd really love to give this computer 5 stars. The screen is beautiful, the keyboard spacious, the speakers clear, the processor fast. Fairly light for the size. But it came with Windows 8, which has been a problem. Windows 8 from what I can tell is made primarily for touch screens, especially tablets. This ASUS isn't a touch screen, so you can't use Windows 8 the way it was designed. It all becomes clumsy to use. You're trying to mimic the swipes of a tablet with a touch pad...it just doesn't work smoothly.Perhaps there's a way to put Windows 8 in a mode where it behaves more like Windows 7...If I figure out how to do that, perhaps I'll give this non-touch screen computer 5 stars. It's really great.

I literally can't find anything wrong with this laptop.  It's more powerful than most desktop computers.

The resolution allows me to use visual studio in a productive mode, rather than to just put out fires.  The combo of CPU and RAM actually lets me get things done.My only complaint is the form factor.  It is about 1/8 of an inch wider than 99.9% of all 17\" laptops.  I cannot get this thing into my old leather (and very expensive) briefcase.  I had to buy a cheapy one to get around.  Even in the new one, I sheared the end off of my wireless keyboard and mouse dongle.If you don't travel too much, this is an awesome buy.  If you do ... make sure your travel accessories fit, and won't break things in use.Also, it is frickin' heavy, but that comes with the territory.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "mouse pad difiicult at best", "Author": "Syko", "ReviewID": "RAN7M9A95CLQU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Computer runs smoothly came with windows 8 but windows 8 seams to be like vista with many bugs and issues.
