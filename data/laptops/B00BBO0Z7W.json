If your someone who wants a locked down computer with no freedom to put your own operating system then this computer is great. I spent 10 hours trying to figure out how to enter the bios, then finally when I got into the bios by using FN-ESC, F2 and F10 finally I was able to enter the bios. Changing the boot order is the hardest part, you first must disable every option then change one of the lines to legacy.Make sure before buying you have the seller take off Windows and have a clean bios on this that allows you to boot off a USB if not you will spend hours trying to figure this POS out.After finally getting Ubuntu on this computer videos are working great, Flash and HTML5 works awesome. I have yet to call via skype but I was able to download via the website Dev file. I have yet to tax the processor out but I am going to run some tests and update this review.Best thing I have found so far is that this 17 inch display is very clear and has a ton of work space to get multiple things done at one time.January 04 2014:After using this for a few months I am very happy. I am using my Samsung Series 3 NP350E7C-A01US Intel 3rd generation Core i7 as my secondary computer. After setting up hard drive encryption I feel much safer if this is stolen. Using VLC as my main video player this is outstanding and has not crashed on me at all. I have not edited images with gimp yet but I doubt any issues will arise.I still have yet to fill the 2 Terra-byte hard drive but I will say it is so slow adding files to sd cards and hurtsFeb 8 2014: I just started a youtube channel tinyurl.com/dmchronicles and have edited my youtube videos on this computer using Openshot for video editing,Audacity for audio. Having used these programs the processor is taxed to its potential but I have had no problems so far. I have recently purchased the Audio Technica ATR-2500 which is a USB powered microphone. Using two of them the microphones are native USB and come up as its own audio card. Through pulse and Audacity everything is perfect. I have had way more success with this laptop than my home built tower which was way more expensive.", "Date": "July 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great Machine", "Author": "Robert J. Pipes", "ReviewID": "R2JVMJVACVRJMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a bigger laptop to use for my own purposes and also in my job giving training sessions in basic computer use. I agonized for several weeks trying to decide which one and finally settled on the Samsung because of the large 1TB disc, 8GB ram and the 17.3\" screen and also the I7 processor which could handle virtualbox software for Win 7 and XP operating systems to run as virtual machines concurrently with Win 8. I now have Virtualbox, Win 7, Win 8 and XP installed and running and it handles it with ease. The screen size is very good for me. The only downside is that this is not a light machine. When you put it in a bag with power cord and other stuff I carry around it is a load. But that is the trade off I made.I have not noticed a problem with the sound as some others have, but then again at my age, I dont need a boom box. And what can you say about Win 8? It had me baffled for a couple of days but now it is OK and I can live with it. I use an Iphone so it I kind of understand what  they are trying to do and I understand there may be an update coming that will improve it.I would reccommend this machine if you are looking for one that is this big (disc, ram, processor) and it comes at a great price.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Laptop", "Author": "Ambria Lee", "ReviewID": "R1ZGCNP2SIZ5BX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was hesitate to buy this laptop at first because there was only one review when I did.  But I'm happy with my decision.PROS:-Great matte screen-vibrate colors-big screen-full keyboard (I'm not a fan of the full keyboard but it's growing on me)-Fast Processor-Lighter than my old Toshiba 15\"-Not touch but I have my mouse with wheel to operate Windows 8-Windows 8 -- Just my thoughts on it...Love it!  If you are an android user, you'll probably love it -- if you are a Ipad/Iphone person, you'll probably hate it - if you use an android system on a tablet, you'll love it too-Desktop if you're use to Windows 7 and don't like Windows 8-Windows 8 Facebook is amazingCons:-Big laptop - I still can sit with it on my lap though with no problems, but to carry it around, it's big-No backlit keyboard-No light to tell you when the cap lock is onThis does what I want it to do and it is on the high end of laptops with it's 1 terabyte drive, but well worth the money.  You can't beat the price for what it all has in it.I bought this from ValueShop and did the 2 day shipping.
