I actually got it on clearance from Staples. It was originally $1,000 and the performance shows it!This processor is by far the best I've used so far. This thing runs Planetside 2 without any hiccups and that's not even with my graphics setting set to performance. It loads fast, gets online and connected quickly and I can't be happier. My only gripe would be that I only have 3 usb ports and battery life but that's mostly my fault because I keep screen brightness high when I game and I definitely put it through its paces. The screen is not wildly impressive but it certainly does enough haha", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's good", "Author": "Andy Kim", "ReviewID": "RP5LDYVU3YELB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am guessing, choosing the cheap route brought some defects to this product.Pros1. Graphics (I don't know if its the screen or graphics, but has some pixelation issues on videos, but its still gets that gets it aligned, might be internet problem.)2. Processor (Good processor, competes with higher end I3 or lower end I5, plus turbo boost).3. Ram (Standard computers require 4gigs, but this has 6gigs, so its good upgrade from my previous laptop.Cons1. Wifi Problem and Cover designs (Had wires oppositely connected to where it was not getting full bandwidth from my router, but fixed that, but opening the back cover was tricky too, ended up cracking end of it. -_-, should have stick with the past pavillion dv6 covers, HP).2. Touchpad, it has response issues like other reviews said, gets little annoying when using at school without mouse, but still manageable.OverallGood laptop, looks great and thinner than older models, and gets that pavillion performance.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!! (UPDATED)", "Author": "SB", "ReviewID": "R2A6WTXXF9HM2J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I bought this laptop from staples on black friday, I'll review it here for any potential buyers. First off, let me say that if you hate Windows 8, then stay away as this as Windows 8 written all over it. It was recently updated to Windows 8.1 a few weeks back for this specific laptop, also it is NOT touchscreen. I needed a laptop that could do all the typical stuff a laptop should do, but with some impressive power, especially for gaming, all while being below $500. I am not disappointed, I have a growing library of games on Steam and I have tested from older games(2010 and below) to the latest (2012-latest tomb raider and injustice on pc) I can run games from 2008-2010 at high settings with smooth framerates, while games like tomb raider and bioshock infinite might not exactly be so smooth at high but smooth at medium/normal settings(make sure you put the laptop at high performance settings so that it uses all the power it has for the gaming). There isn't significant heating if you have a cooling pad(a good one) and will only get very slightly warm, max resolution is 1366x768.only problems:1) the pad can be unresponsive at times, but that is rare, most people end up buying mouses for laptops anyway because some people don't like those touch/track pads on laptops2) windows 8 can be confusingIt is a good laptop for those who don't want to spend $1000+ on a gaming laptop, this does gaming decently while having everything a typical laptop has, also has a trial for norton internet security and microsoft office 2013UPDATE MAY 22 2014: Unfortunately my trackpad's left-click button has become sorta loose and does not feel strong like the barely used right-click, it feels like if the spring under the button gave out and now it makes an annoying click and is kinda wobbly now, still works, but definitely got loose after much use, I kinda expected this though because the track pad feels really plastic cheap.For cheap trackpad, it goes down 1 star.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$469.00", "Features": "2.1GHz up to 2.9GHz AMD Elite Quad-Core A10-5745M Accelerated Processor\n4MB L2 Cache\n6GB DDR3L SDRAM (2 DIMM)\n750GB 5400RPM hard drive with HP ProtectSmart Hard Drive Protection\nSuperMulti DVD burner", "Name": "HP HP Pavilion 15-N066US AMD Elite Quad-Core A10-5745M 15\" 6GB 750GB Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41FlJDWHpeL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GZKB2JC"}}
