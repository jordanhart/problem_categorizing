The attention to detail is amazing, for example, the keyboard automatically illuminates itself in dimly lit areas.  The single button mouse and trackpad can double as a two button mouse:  place 2 fingers on the trackpad and click the button and it's a right-click.  Place 2 fingers down and slide them up or down scrolls the page.It has been good for running games.  I have the 128MB video card in mine and seems to handle C&C; Generals and Half-Life2 with ease (via my boot camp partition running Windows).  I have even run C&C; Generals via a virtual machine, and it was certainly playable (though I had to turn some of the settings down to medium instead of high).  I haven't tried any other games at this point.  No doubt the 256MB model should handle things even better.Installing Windows via boot camp is a snap, and then installing some virtual machine software allows you have to Windows whenever you need it.  Run it side by side with OS X, or reboot into Windows natively.The worst part about this notebook is battery power.  With everything turned on and the screen brightness on high, the battery will only last 1.5, maybe 2 hours.  This isn't good for using on plane rides longer that that.  However, I was able to watch 2 movies in a row (approximately 4 hours) and still have some life left.  I accomplished this by ripping the movies to my hard drive (doing so saves power since it doesn't have to spin a DVD in the drive constantly during playback), disabling the wireless card, and lowering the brightness as low as possible.  Unfortunately I can't seem to control screen brightness when booting directly to Windows, so the battery life is much worse when running Windows.Apple just released a battery update in early October 2007.  It appears the battery life is better (I can now get about 3.5 hours with the brightness at about 50-60% when simply checking email, browsing the web etc.).  I'm very pleased with that update!There is very little learning curve if this is your first time using a Mac.  It's rock solid (in fact, the only application that seems to crash on me is MS Office), and rarely requires software updates (unlike Windows).  Though not many viruses affect Macs, some still do and there is anti-virus software available for Macs.If you're considering this but not sure, just take the plunge.

It seems well made, is  powerful and most importantly OS X is a much better thought out OS than Vista and generally better supported than Linux.  It has a few shortcomings such as just 2 USB ports, and it gets too hot due to the metal frame. I could live with these but I have struggled fruitlessly to get decent wifi internet speeds.  (My friend's Thinkpad is 10 times as fast to download and render pages on my wifi system side by side.  Ive spent ages searching the web for the solution and found loads of people have similar problems (Just Google for \"macbook pro slow wifi connection\" if you don't believe me.  There doesnt seem to be one  single problem and people have come up with a range of solutions.  Some people  say its WEP keys  that are the problem, other that its something to do with the N wifi card. I do get geat speeds if i take it to the Apple store and use their non encrypted Wifi connection. Probably I could eventually get it to work, but I want this laptop to travel around the world with so i cant afford to take  kiyt thats going to take 6 hours of headaches to get cproperly working each time I get to a place.The other  issue is working within a mixed Mac/Windows enironment.  Boot  camp and parallels are very helpful, but I still have encountrred annoying issues  eg that it doesnt like NTFS formatted disks, that it tries to format Ipods wit MAc  filing system so that they cannot be used on PCs  without special downloads.Bottom line its  a lot of hassle.

It seemed like Apple sorted out the issues and Tiger is now mature so i took the plunge.I bought mine directly from Apple since i qualify for the education discount. I must say that it has the absolute best screen i have ever seen on a computer. It is so bright that i can't view it at more than 75% brightness. The glossy screen shows vivid colors and is a pleasure to view.Mac OS X itself is an amazing OS. Very easy to install and uninstall applications, you don't have to worry about Virus protection but i did enable the firewall. I had 0 problems syncing my phone with it using bluetooth. I had no problems connecting to my printer via our wireless home network. I even added some tweaks to get quicktime to play more types of movie files.

It is fast, powerful and can even handle some mid range games you throw at it (provided you are using Boot Camp). I bought this with the intention of using Aperture 2 and Final Cut and it has served well to that purpose ever since I bought it. In that regard, this product should have received 4 stars.Now the reason why I gave it a 4. It is my belief that merchants such as Amazon should make the shopping and deliberating process of buying an expensive item such as a laptop as easy as possible. It was easy enough to find all of the MBPs offered by Amazon, but it became quite hard to distinguish between which model offered what and which model lacked a certain feature. I even called Amazon CSR to verify to see if this was indeed the model with multi-touch and was told that it was. Of course, upon receiving the product, I realized that it was not. Too lazy to deal with returns, nor did I think it was really necessary, I just forgot about it. But the important thing to take away is that the Amazon CSR basically read off the description page and knew almost nothing of what I was asking. It might be better if I had done some more research but I was pressed for time. I recommend anyone buying similar items (ie. different models of MBP) to do additional outside research or hope that Amazon will put up a comparison feature within their web page.But let me be clear, this product is near perfect.

I was a life long Windows user that switched to Mac.  I've used various Macs in the past and had become pretty familiar with OS X....but this is the first Apple I've personally owned.  Having said that....OS X is so powerful it makes the computing life so much easier.  I believe many PC users that \"hate\" Apple are more afraid of changing than actually having a reason to dislike Apple.Anyways...  My only complaint about the MBP is the screen resolution.  On the 15 inch version the resolution is a native 1440x900.  At first I was a bit put off by this--but considering how crisp and bright the LCD screen is I was willing to operate at the \"lower\" resolution.  I went from my previous laptop's resolution of 1280x1050 to 1440x900 and after a few days I'm pretty happy.  Still the question remains as to why Apple would limit you to this lower resolution.Everything else about the MBP is top notch.  At first I thought the aluminum casing would be to delicate for everyday use--but fortunately the casing seems to be bulletproof.  It doesn't seem to fingerprint or scratch easily at all.All in all you cannot go wrong with the MBR.  If you think, as I did, that the lower resolution would be a deterrent to taking the step into Apple's world--don't be.  At the very least go look at this beautiful LED driven screen and see what you're missing...or should I say not going to miss?", "Date": "December 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Top Notch and Worth Every Dime", "Author": "Deshleman \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "RPSVXZ80YS7SS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Its funny how we as consumers don't hesitate to buy something inexpensive, like overpriced Starbucks coffee every day (which really adds up), but when it comes to a $2000 investment, like this laptop, we hesitate.

I was hesitant at first to make the purchase, wondering if I really needed it, but it is an investment that is and will continue to pay off, not just for college, but for life in general.  Computers, and especially laptops, are becoming cache's of personal life. What better way to trust our computing experience and organize our digital life, than to a good computer. You pay for what you get, and Mac's are the best.So if you want a laptop that is powerful (it's my all in one solution), simple to use, great battery life (a good solid 4 hours), reliable and secure, brilliant hi resolution screen, this is what you should go for.

Mac is my new favorite at school :) It's a lot smoother and simpler than Windows and the programs that are preinstalled (and FREE!) are amazing to say the least :) When ordering this product, the only \"built in\" option I'd say you absolutely NEED is the speed upgrade from \"5400 rpm\" to \"7200 rpm\". If money is not an issue for you, then of course I'd recommend buying ALL the options lol, but if you have a budget (like most of us)...REASON (for purchasing speed upgrade): As you gradually save more information/programs on your laptop (whether it's a Mac OR PC)... you will start to see a decrease in speed on your system. With the upgrade, as your computer slows down it will then eventually become as fast as it would've been in the first place WITHOUT the upgrade. Yes, you could always purchase the doubled memory (preinstalled is $700/separate is $500) OR you could save your specific files on USB memory drives! Maybe it's only because I'm a student... but I've discovered it's easier to save all my documents/pictures/videos/web history for each class on these drives (and it also develops my organization skills! lol). I have 6 classes and with 2GB USBs at $20 each that's only $120.By doing this, the only thing slowing down your computer will be programs you later install or download... and the decrease in your system's speed will occur 1/2 as quickly than if you'd been saving EVERYTHING on it.If you're interested in any other information I can give you about this (or any computer), email me at RachelLMayo@gmail.com :) I'd be more than happy to help!", "Date": "September 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Macbook Pro 15\"", "Author": "Omar Noguera", "ReviewID": "R24SOA87QWYU3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Don't have too many words for this but EXCELLENT.Got it working with dual boot using Leopard and Win XP for a long while and it's simply excellent.

There are much better laptops available. Be aware the price offered here at Amazon by third party dealers is not the cheapest available. Apple sells it for less than the current price shown. The strongest thing going for the system is it's operating system which gives a brief breath of fresh air from the coldness found in Windows. There is also a strong community of users who will help you out and a friendly customer service team.The main issues are a screen which is horrific. Apple can no longer be known for graphics. The maximum resolution found on the screen is less than other models sold by their competitors. This is how this system was designed. Investigate.The MacBook Pro screens have a defect affecting most of the production currently. The lower 1/3 of the screen will have a yellowish/golden hue. The very top of the monitor has a 1mm bright white line. The tones from top to bottom are inconsistent. The screens background helps to mask the problem but you will see it if you ever do any work with the system.The viewing angle is very narrow. If your head leaves a 4 inch box the screen is almost unreadible and will be golden in color. This is due to the \"LED\" backlighting system. Investigate.If you are still intent on an Macbook look at the 17 inch model. You will notice the 17\" is the most commonly reviewed model because the other ones will be horribly received. It does not use the LED backlighting and the maximum resolution is higher.The second main issue is something Mac users are referring to as \"Kernel panic\". It is the same thing as Microsoft's notorius \"blue screen of death\"except the cause is the hardware. Should your system have \"kernel panic\" you will have a locked up, unusable system. The work will have gone unsaved and you will be out of the notebook for 3 weeks as they repair the brand new system. Investigate this further.Yes, stick a fork in it.
