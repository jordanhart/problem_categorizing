{"Reviews": [{"Title": "From Mac to Chromebook 14 \"The Break Up\"", "Author": "alex mayers", "ReviewID": "R3H0JTF9FOAYWX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didnt buy my chromebook from amazon rather from walmart. Coming from a die hard Apple fan, i can say i am blown away. I had to be honest with myself. Did i really use my mac book (late 2009) for anything other than word processing, emails, social media, and reddit? Nope! So i made the switch. In all honesty, i loved mac for the structural integrity of their products. They just felt solid. So when i touched the chromebook 14, i was not dissapointed. The track pad feels slightly less responsive and is not a smooth as my mac book. But all other factors trump this complaint. I was already confined to the use of the chrome browser and google drive apps while using my mac, so the transition was flawless. Rendering of PDFs and web sites is lightning fast. I have yet to explore beyond my own personal use, but i dont think this thing can do much more than what i mentioned before. If you are in the market for a new computer, ask yourself, \"do i really need the fluff and fun? Will technology be improved upon to the point that i will be frustrated with what i have in three years? \" Technology is just moving too fast to invest 1000 + dollars into something that ultimately becomes \"obsolete\" in a few years.

I've had it a couple months, & love everything about it. I use my regular windows laptop for work & a bit of surfing, but when I'm just playing, I go to this. It is unbelievably fast. From touching the on button to entering my password is 5 seconds...every time. It's amazing. Consequently, I shut it off a lot more. I got a mouse for it when I ordered it, but I'll probably give it away, because it's such a responsive, pleasant trackpad to use. I keep the 4G t mobile disabled, but occassionally our wifi goes out, & when that happened, this connected seamlessly, so I could keep going. Also, it receives the wifi signal better than my regular laptop. A couple other times when my pc left me for no signal, I went to my Chromebook, & it still had reception...must be a better antenna or something. I haven't done any work related things on this, & I haven't saved any docs, or used any of the cloud storage. I may do that, but 2 years just doesn't seem like all that long to me, & I want to know what they're going to charge afterwards, before I start putting things in the cloud & then maybe having to pay an exhorbitant fee to retrieve them. I know I could make this work for all my needs if I wanted or needed to, but out of sheer laziness I haven't really explored that option. The keys feel very solid & responsive to type on, though it looks like the lower case letters are just stickers, so I hope they last. Having said that, it doesn't actually look or feel cheap. The texture is very nice, as in you can get a firm grip on it, and it doesn't show fingerprints or smudges easily. The weight is relative, I suppose. My pc is pretty heavy at over 5lbs., so to me this is light as a feather at 4. The display isn't the sharpest, but it's not bad either. It is glossy, and the viewing angle is limited, but to me that's not an issue. I can't lie though. The main reason I bought this particular model is it's turquoise. When they were first advertised, I knew I had to have one, because I just loved how it looked. I know that's no reason to buy anything, & the last time I bought a tv, (for it's looks), it died about a week after the warranty. But I'm glad I went ahead, because this is a much better purchase. I know I shouldn't say this about an inanimate object, but I looove my chromebook!PS.I included this video to show this super easy stand I made for my chromebook while using my elliptical. It is a leftover piece of shelving that my other PC usually sits on for cooling purposes. I did place the little caps on the rough ends. See the video & save a lot of money if this configuration works for you. The CB fits so securely on this shelf it even catches under the top lip for added though unnecessary protection. I have rock & rolled my machine to 20 mph & there no slippage whatsoever.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for Google freaks!", "Author": "SHERRI HERRON", "ReviewID": "R3T8OXVMM5H664", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this Chromebook! I bought mine at Walmart and loved it so much I bought a 2nd one for my daughter. I originally bought an Hp touch screen laptop that had windows 8. It had so much junk that I didn't need so I decided to return it for the Chromebook. First of all I really only use my computer for web browsing, email, and social media so if your looking for a full service laptop this probably isn't for you. I'm a full time student and use Google docs and slides all the time. This Chromebook is super fast and super easy has exactly everything I need including a battery that lasts at least 8hrs and charges super fast as well. There is no need for virus protection because Google takes care of all that. This particular Chromebook comes with 200mb of free 4G service a month for 2yrs a plus for when wifi isn't available.This is a great second computer for around the house as well and because its so easy I would recommend it for those who aren't that experienced with computers. All I can say is I wish I had this Chromebook sooner! I love it and I'm sure you will too.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Liked it so much I had to buy two...", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "RXNB9E7BMM3VA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife's 13\" macbook pro from 2010 was due for a replacement (wear and tear and a few drops which left it still functional, but with a bent frame). We thought we'd try one of these as a cheaper alternative since mainly she's a chat, photo, and tumblr junkie. She's been extremely happy with the chromebook as a replacement for her mac.The machine is extremely responsive and fast at multitasking and app startup. Far faster than any mac or PC I've used in the past. The Chrome OS seems to be extremely streamlined and built for speed. The app selection is quite solid, though an official skype app is still needed (currently using IM+ as it connects to Skype).The build quality is excellent, and frankly the pictures don't do its exterior style justice. It's an impressively designed and built machine and is a pleasure to hold.The touchpad is one of the best non-mac touchpads I've seen (nothing can touch a mac touchpad imho). It feels good to use and has a good click pressure and isn't sticky or too rough.The keyboard feels almost identical to a mac keyboard. Definitely the best non-mac keyboard I've used.It comes with free 200mb/mo of t-mobile HSDPA internet (they call it 4g, but it's not LTE. More like 3.5g). If you want more than 200mb/mo, t-mobile's prices kinda suck, but you should be able to stick a sim-card from your phone in there in a pinch and have more data. It didn't seem to be tied to T-Mobile itself, and it was able to find an AT&T; network while I was playing with it. They don't require a CC or anything to set up the free internet access, which is nice. Naturally it has WIFI for general use.I used my wife's for about 15 minutes and got another for myself. I love the thing as well. It's replacing a Win8 Acer Ultrabook for me for casual use, though I'll still be keeping the Acer for work related things (development tools, etc). It's simply faster at sitting down on the couch and using without any fuss or waiting. It was honestly jarring using the Win8 machine again and having to actually wait for things to happen.The chromebook is not a work machine, but for general/casual use it's perfect. A huge portion of the PC/Mac market could easily replace their PCs/Notebooks with a Chromebook and be very happy with the switch. This is easily one of the best chromebook machines on the market at the moment.
