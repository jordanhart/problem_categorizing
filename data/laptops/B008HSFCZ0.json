{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great laptop but no bluetooth", "Author": "Blue RR", "ReviewID": "R263LXFJ4YG0OW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Contrary to the Amazon product features description, this particular model does not have bluetooth installed, so keep that in mind if ever bluetooth constitutes an important feature for you. This laptop also has an integrated, non-user replaceable battery, which could be an issue 2 or 3 years from now when the battery dies (following the apple/ultrabook trend). The weight is also a bit heavy for the sleek form factor.Enough of the cons and on to the pros...Price - Compared with other laptops with comparable specs the price is very competitiveProcessor - Very capable processor with Passmark score of 2862 can handle anything you care to throw at it (aside from graphics intensive games, though I personally haven't tested it out).Looks - Brushed aluminum lid and metal accents on the faux speaker grill look classySound - Dolby home theater works wonders when you connect a set of headphonesBattery life - I got 6.5 hours on the first charge, though I'm still conditioning the battery. It's advertised to get 8+ hours.Power brick - Small, light and compactOS - from the feedback I've been reading on Windows 8, I'm glad I stuck with Windows 7 this time around. Maybe I'll consider Windows 9.In summary, it's a handsome, powerful, affordable laptop.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best laptop I've owned", "Author": "EM", "ReviewID": "R29FMBIU87MNKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If this computer had a built-in light, like Lenovo's think light, it would be perfect.  Otherwise, I like the design.  It really is a pretty computer.  Fast. Runs cool. Speaker sound is excellent. Long battery life.  Key placement good too.  Yeah, I really like this one.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "THE BEST LAPTOP ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!", "Author": "NKul", "ReviewID": "R2H2MSKX3JESMS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is the epitome of an amazing laptop. It NEVER crashes, lags, or breaks down - and I've had it for a while now! It's amazing and I'd recommend it over any other laptop - the Sonys, the Toshibas, HPs, Asus, and even the Macs. It's reliable and best part is, for $450 you're getting quite a steal of a deal!!!", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little Laptop", "Author": "A customer \"Jenn\"", "ReviewID": "R24AGWNDY3WRXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had great performance on this computer since I bought it last summer.

I love the speed and it's size.

Not a fan of the blue color and a bit heavy, but otherwise met my expectations at a great price.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Suggest getting extended warranty - screen cracks easily", "Author": "Mary J. Seitz \"complex\"", "ReviewID": "R5A8ERMIWUKYQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If not for the screen cracking on 2 of these, I would have rated it 5 star.I have had 2 of these and both of them the screen cracked from minor bumps.  The first was packed in a suitcase with 2 layers of clothes around it.  The suitcase was not dropped - just went into the hatchback of a Prius and out again and it was hand carried.  The second there was a pencil in the hinge and I gently started to close the laptop and the glass broke.And Acer support was rude and tried to get me to send it to them for support for $199.  My local repair shop will do it for $180, so it's going there.  I've only had the notebook for a month; the other one cracked after 2 months.So be very careful with it.  Don't let it outside in the hot sun or cold.Part of the issue is that it's a thin notebook.  I can twist the cover it's so thin.", "Date": "January 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2nd generation Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i3-2370M Processor,4096MB DDR3 Dual-Channel 1066MHz Memory,320GB 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive\n320GB 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive,1.3 Megapixel HD Webcam,Multi-in-1 Digital Media Card Reader\nBluetooth\u00ae 2.1+EDR (Enhanced Data Rate),2 - USB 2.0 Ports & 1 - USB 3.0 Port,1 - HDMI\u2122 Port with HDCP Support\n14\" HD Widescreen CineCrystal\u2122 LED-backlit Display,8X DVD-Super Multi Double-Layer Drive,1.3 Megapixel HD Webcam\n802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi CERTIFIED\u2122,10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet LAN, Intel\u00ae Wireless Display*", "Name": "Acer AS4830T-6678 14\" Laptop (Intel i3-2370 Processor, 320GB Hard Drive, 4GB RAM)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31%2BeJh32fQL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008HSFCZ0"}}
