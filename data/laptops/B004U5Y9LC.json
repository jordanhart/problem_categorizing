I'm a software developer.It is a great machine with a few minor negatives. First the negatives:1) Even with the docking station (highly recommended) it will drive only two external monitors, for a total of three if you count the internal screen.I don't consider this a fatal flaw, as I use a Displaylink device to drive a third big monitor2) You don't get RAID on this model - if that matters any more3) Yes, it could use an SSD drive, but that would add a lot to the pricePositives:1) Very fast processor. It typically runs all four cores at 3 Ghz and can run a single core at as high as 3.3 Ghz2) Expandable: I immediately put in 8 more GB of RAM for 16 GB total. Note - I had to remove the keyboard to get to one of the extra RAM slots - no big deal  It also has an Ultrabay - be sure to get the $60 hard disk adapter - and I threw in another 500GB 7200RPM drive.3) It has 2 USB 3 ports, as well as 1 eSATA/USB combo powered port. This means I can boot from an external 2.5 \" hard drive via a special cable (sold on Amazon).4) It has an mSATA slot for an internal WAN modem OR Micro SSD card - nice!5) The screen is high resolution and very bright LED back lit. I can easily see it outdoors6) Rugged, durable build. Good thermal design - runs cool.7) Three year warranty  There are many more positives, but suffice to say that this is a great, not perfect, but a great machine.", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lenovo W520: a monster machine with few cons and lot of pros", "Author": "Gabriele", "ReviewID": "R2OU8WR6M04LU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this laptop as my photo editing portable workstation and would like to share with you some of my opinions even if maybe it's still early since less than 2 weeks passed by.CPU: very very fast, you can really tell the difference from older PCs, Canon 5D Mark II 21 Mpixel RAW files rendering was almost on the fly.RAM: 8GB seems enough but there's still plenty of space for expansion up to 32GB which probably I'll do once the prices drop down.HDD: think this is probably the only bottleneck (or at lest this is what I understand using the Windows index). There's still the possibility to add an SSD.Nvidia Quadro 1000M 2GB: still have to test it with some 3D applications, Optimus seems to work well under Windows, still have to find a way to use it under Linux though.Fingerprint reader: really nice, it even allows you to turn on the computer and login automatically swiping your finger just once. (I didn't manage to make it work on Linux yet but maybe there's a workaround)Camera: seems quite good also in low light situations.Speakers: they seem quite low, but apparently it should be something related to drivers or internal settings and not physical limitations since on Linux or VLC I can boost up the volume over 100%.USB ports: nice to have 4 of them, but it would have been nice also to have some of them on the right side since 3 of them are placed on the left and one on the back.Color Calibrator: I've found out sadly it's not present in this specific model, but it is as an option.Keyboard: comfortable enough but not as good as the Sony Vaio, weird position for the Fn (swappable with Ctrl key from BIOS) and Del keys.I'd also like to replace it with the Italian keyboard but I don't know where I should get the replacement part nor the price.The screen looks AWESOME and it's very good it has 15 levels of brightness so it can be extremely dim for the night or very bright for viewing under sunlight.I haven't tried the Display Port since I have no device to connect it to at the moment.Thermal design:it is absolutely the coolest laptop I've ever had.170W Power adapter: a HUGE and HEAVY brick but it does its job, just wish they could build a smaller one.The top cover of the screen is covered with a weird material which easily collects dust.Battery life: still have to test it in a better way since I've been using this PC mostly at home, but when I took it with me out I have to say it surely lasted WAY longer than any other laptop I've ever had even if it is so way much powerful.Overall I'd really recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a mobile workstation to work with graphic and photo/video editing or in any case for a laptop with a very good processing power and long lasting battery life in a 15.6\" form factor.", "Date": "August 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "one hell of a machine", "Author": "georg", "ReviewID": "R3VPE14RS50YF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not much more to say what the first reviewer hasnt already mentioned.I used a Macbook Pro until now (which had - after < 2 years of use - enough bugs for 3 laptops - fan out of control, cd/dvd drive broken, etc.), and I dont regret switching to the W520 (I own a W520 for a month now). I am doing a lot of Matlab image processing on my laptop, and the performance as well as screen resolution / quality is great (upon purchase, Lenovo lets you choose between 3 different screens with different maximum resolutions - i chose the highest resolution - 1920 X 1080; also they let you choose between 2 different gpus). One unique thing to mention is that you have full control over which graphics processor (integrated vs. Nvidia gpu) your laptop uses when, and for which application separately - i think this is kind of new and unique.The only thing that bothered me initially was Lenovo's trackpad, which doesnt come close to the comfort of my Macbook pad. Normal cursor control is ok, but e.g. two-finger scrolling is almost impossible. After my initial disappointment,  I got really hooked to using the red lenovo track point. It takes one to two days to get used to it, but once you have the hang of it, it's much more convenient for cursor control, scrolling (instead of 2 - finger scrolling, one uses the middle button above the trackpad), etc. than the track pad. So - no complaints there. And if you want to do e.g. technical drawing, you may want to use a mouse in any case...One thing more that took me a bit of patience to figure out was the fact that - by default - the operating system shuts down and 'unmounts' the physical cd drive when not in use. This is a good feature as it helps saving energy. However, it interferes with the installation and usage of virtual drives (e.g. Daemon tools). Anyway, I figured out that you can easily disable this CD drive - auto-shutdown option. So - if you have the money - stop looking. This is your machine.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "When it works it's great, but when it doesn't...", "Author": "Robert Ziuchkovski", "ReviewID": "R3GQOEJ7XWR9ZQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased a W520 after researching quite a few laptops.  On paper, this laptop has it all...powerful processor, 4 dimm slots and support for 32gb memory, good discrete graphics options, excellent display, great battery.  You name it, this laptop has it.That said, I believe Lenovo is skimping on parts, QA, or engineering (perhaps all of the above).  I have owned this laptop for little over a month and already run into two nasty defects:- First, the speakers on the laptop work intermittently.  It turns out the speaker wires are routed directly over the cpu/gpu heatsink and have no heat shrink protecting them.  When the proc and gpu are going full tilt, the heatsink melts the coating on the wires and they short-out.  Thankfully someone posted excellent info on the matter at [...].  What I find annoying is this problem was first reported in May 2011 [...] and W520s are still being shipped without heat shrink protecting the speaker wires.  My laptop was assembled in February 2012.  Eight months after the problem was reported, my laptop shipped with a known and easily addressable defect.- Second, my W520 suffers from the 'sudden shutdown syndrome'.  This is a problem in which the laptop will shutdown and reboot sporadically once or twice a day...no BSOD or any other diagnostics.  It behaves as if someone yanks the power suddenly.  This problem was first reported in June 2011 and has gone unresolved since.  There are over 100 pages of forum posts dedicated to it on the Lenovo Support forums:[...]Certainly both of these problems may be addressed by replacement hardware.  What irks me is that this is Lenovo's top-of-the-line, flagship laptop, and it seems they don't care if they are shipped with defects.  I would be less upset if they put genuine effort into identifying the design flaws, replacing existing flawed parts, *and shipping updated/fixed laptops*.  Instead, they are still shipping flawed laptops and are putting minimal effort into isolating the design flaws.  Yes, a Lenovo staffer pops onto the forum every now and again and says they are working on it, but it wreaks of minimal PR / damage control.  If they were genuinely serious about addressing the defects, they would ship a tested, functioning replacement laptop to those affected, and send all of the faulty laptops directly to engineering for analysis.  Instead they have cherry-picked one laptop at a time, and often these have been the laptops that shutdown sporadically once every week or so.  My own laptop shuts down once or twice a day.  I coordinated with a Lenovo employee, offering to send it directly to their engineering team for diagnosis.  I made the offer two weeks ago, have followed-up multiple times, and still they have not taken the laptop.  Simply put, they hardly care about addressing the issue.I know this likely comes down to a business decision on Lenovo's end.  If design flaws only affect 1-2% of their shipped laptops, perhaps they feel it isn't worth the effort to diagnose.  Personally, I prefer companies that prioritize their customers' satisfaction.  For that reason, this will be my last Lenovo purchase.  I would advise others to stay away as well.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "w520", "Author": "peteredm", "ReviewID": "RM93XBY4Q3SU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All in all a great laptop.

Reviews at the time (about 18 months ago) were very positive and editorial reviews don't tend to focus on build quality much because it's hard to measure.I have come to hate this machine. It does have some positives, which I will include for the sake of fairness. But it is filled with so many hardware / driver bugs that I just want to throw it out the window. Here is a list of the ones I can think off the top of my head that drive me crazy. Ready?- Sometimes it chooses not to sleep when I close the lid or explicitly ask it to (yes I've configured Windows 7 to sleep on lid close). Sometimes I hear it wake up (it beeps) in the middle of the night, then go back to sleep again, often more than once. While the lid is closed!- The built-in microphone doesn't work. The sophisticated dual-head technology for noise cancellation effectively cancels me out with it, no matter how far or close I speak from it. The other party can hear something, sometimes better than others, but it is just terrible quality. I often hang up VoIP calls in frustration and reach for my USB headset.- USB slots fail every other week. My USB mouse is dead when that happens. Rebooting fixes it.- Turning the WiFi switch off and back on causes Windows to lose the setting to automatically connect to my WiFi networks.- The screen brightness adjustment keystrokes (Fn-Home, Fn-End) do not work about once a week. A reboot fixes it.- The mute light, while a good idea, sometimes goes out of sync with the actual Windows mute state- The mouse wheel scroll speed resets to 1 line per wheel tick about once a week.  Merely opening the Mouse dialog in Control Panel fixes it.I have attempted driver upgrades which have either not helped or temporarily improved the situation until another driver update cancelled them out.Furthermore, it suffers from general poor design- Poor speaker quality- Putting the \"back\" and \"forward\" browser buttons right next to the cursor keys is disastrous. I discovered this after I spent 20 minutes typing in a web textbox. I wanted to move the cursor to make some final edits and hit the back key by accident instead. Lost all my work. I have since remapped those keys to something else and learned my lesson to never write long responses in a browser directly.- The Fn key is where the Ctrl key is typically. It took me about a year of pressing Fn when I meant Ctrl.- It doesn't have a mic jack; only headphones- It weighs like a brick (but it gives good battery life in return)I do want to state a few positives, which earn it its second star:- Performance is great- It absorbs water spills like a champion. It is designed to be water resistant, with dedicated drain holes that safely guide the water from top out through the bottom.- Great screen. Crisp, with a dark black and great contrast- I like the feel of the touchpad. It doesn't get slick from oil residue due a grid of micro bumps and a matte material- Good keyboard response. It has the right balance of softness and resistance- Mute lights (for mic and speakers)In general though, I'm appalled at the sheer number of defects which makes me question Lenovo's commitment to build quality. I will be trying a different brand for my next laptop and hope that there is still a good quality machine being made.", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great multi use notebook", "Author": "K. merrill \"mechman76\"", "ReviewID": "R31UJN8ZFSXNOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it.

Even in a quiet hotel room you might have trouble hearing some dialog on a TV show or movie you watch.- Some of the crapware included with these machines is just there to increase the boot time.  Spend some time and clean some of this stuff out.- It really is big and heavy, and the 170W power brick really is relatively gigantic- To my mind its time for ALL laptops to ship with small mSata boot SSDs alongside rotating media drives for your data.  The good news is you can configure this machine that way easily after you buy the SSD.  But there should be options to have Lenovo ship it that way.- Like others I really preferred the old 1920x1200 displays that you can't buy any more in the big 16:9 movement- The docks that Lenovo sells now are kind of crappy compared to the older ones.

I work overseas and need a reliable and powerful machine. On paper the W520 seems like the best bet, and I have had great success with Thinkpad's in the past, however this is not the case with the w520.The first week it performed flawlessly, on day 8 it would not turn on. I had powered it down for the night and in the morning it was just dead. I checked all usual suspects and contacted Lenovo. Came to the conclusion after long troubleshooting session over the phone with someone I could not even understand that the motherboard was most likely fried, and they have had the same issue before. They shipped the return box promptly free of charge with preprinted labels (a+ for effort) after a few weeks in the shop I got the laptop back supposedly fixed with mother board replacement and a few other things. No more than 3 days later the same thing, wouldn't turn on, no bios screen, nothing. called Lenovo again and they tried to say it's just a glitch and had static built up, and it was no big deal, they had my take it apart and disconnect internal battery. still didn't fix the issue. so I go through the whole process again. and Again get the repair order saying yet another motherboard is fried.So for a laptop that claims superior quality and reliability this has hit as far from the mark as possible! I am now overseas for 4 months using my old laptop b/c there's no way I can trust the w520. In less than a month's time it has completely failed.

Its NVidia card makes it perfect for working with Adobe CS5, and its built-in screen is superb. It mostly sits on a desk, attached to a second monitor, keyboard, hard drive, and mouse. A few weeks after buying it, I turned off the computer, unplugged the plugs, and moved it from one room to another. When I turned it on again, the screen was dead. No sign of damage - just black. The screen had to be replaced under warranty.A few weeks later, and the same thing happened again. I take the computer to a meeting, take it out of its (heavily padded) bag, and no screen. That time, the motherboard had to be replaced. After that, I was afraid to move it, and kept the computer on my desk.I started to feel a little foolish, treating this sturdy laptop like a desktop machine. After all, the problem had been fixed. I took a chance and brought the computer to a meeting in a big padded backpack. No problems. It left the house on two more occasions, and worked like a champ. Then, buoyed up by the prospect of a laptop that could be moved from one place to another without self-destructing, I carefully moved the laptop from my desk to a table in another room. Turned it on and both the screen and keyboard are dead.I'll have to send it off for repair again. After that, with my warranty period coming to an end in a few months, I guess my rule will have to be that I don't EVER move it off the desk.To their credit, Lenovo has a good number of service outlets - mostly independent shops with varying levels of service - but each return means at least a week with no computer.I have no idea what's causing these problems. Maybe there's some lemon component that the repair people haven't identified. Maybe it has an unusual susceptibility to static. Or maybe I'm just unlucky.

Now after more than half a year of using it, keyboard is making noise and I had to repair several stuck keys.  Once in a while when I type keyboard throws out garbage.  Basically I soon will have to buy a new keyboard.2.  Mouse pad got polished.  It comes with bubbly surface from the factory, now that bubbly surface is gone in the middle.3.  Poor construction.  On left corner, away from the screen, it constantly makes noise when I handle it.  Tightening the screw did not help.4.  Battery rattles.I paid $2000 for my notebook and I expect quality, and I did not get quality, thus my 3 star rating.  If I was going to buy a new notebook today I would not get Lenovo, instead I'd look into HP.  Chinese took an excellent brand, Thinkpad, and lowered quality.  DO NOT BUY LENOVO.  I can also attest to my statement from my other experiences with Lenovo.  I often fix notebooks, it is my job, and the #1 brand that comes in to me is Lenovo.  Problems are as always, broken plastics, broken hinges.  Keep in mind, Lenovo is not IBM, Lenovo is made in China, and everything that is made in China suffers in quality department.3 stars, this product does not deserve more.

Greenberg \"Doug\"", "ReviewID": "R3769XTIKWZ7T3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been a Thinkpad guy since the T20 days and was torn when Lenovo acquired them.  Could a foreign company really maintain the same quality control and engineering standards that set IBM apart?  I was skeptical but cautiously optimistic.  I decided to upgrade my (IBM) T60 to a (Lenovo) W520.In short, it's a decent laptop but no IBM.First, some history.1.  The IBM executive who built the Thinkpad brand is Stephen Ward.  A 26 year IBM veteran, a USAToday article described him as -- \"every inch the IBMer, from his navy blue suit to the gold company pin fastened neatly on his lapel. He's not as flashy as some tech CEOs, and he runs a formal office compared with many laid-back Silicon Valley firms.\"2.  Then Lenovo bought the unit.  They made Stephen Ward CEO with a plan to continue running everything the old IBM way.3.  But there were problems from the start.  There was an immediate culture clash between Lenovo's business model of cost cutting, budget laptops and IBM's values of superior products and build quality.  Adding to the difficulty was the fact that the Lenovo staff (now 50% of the Thinkpad dept), could not even speak English.  So they had no ability to understand or communicate with their new leader.4.  To say the least, the integration posed big challenges.  But before it could be completed, Mr. Ward strangely left the company.  This was after just 6 months.5.  What happened next was telling.  He was replaced.  But not by another IBM veteran.  Rather, by William J. Amelio, a senior vice president at (of all places)... Dell.  Other key executive positions were filled, and not with IBM people.  Rather, with folks from places like HP, Acer and Lenovo.6.  Thereafter, a high level of executive turnover ensued.  In 2009, William Amelio was eventually fired as CEO and the job fell back to Lenovo's old CEO, Yang Yuanqing.  Other key executives came and went, at least some leaving to go to Dell.7.  The results have been sadly predictable.  Amazon reviews of Thinkpads have sunk substantially.  If you compare reviews of the old IBM products they got high ratings.  For instance, the t60 (IBM's last model) enjoys a healthy 4.5 stars and 21 reviews as of this writing (not uncommon among the old IBM thinkpads).  The newer Lenovos?  Not so much.  These have tended to get about 3.5 stars and receive significantly more complaints.8.  What are those complaints about?  Mostly basic design and quality control issues.  Back in the IBM days, this was less of a problem because the company offered very few laptops (typically just the R and T series).  The limited menu was to ensure that much thought and effort was put into each product and it worked flawlessly.  Lenovo on the other hand runs on a different philosophy.  Instead of a limited menu, Lenovo offers a virtual Denny's restaurant of laptops (a whopping thirteen series in all).9.  But pumping out so many laptops naturally results in more issues.  There are so many models to keep track of, and with so many different glitches and problems it's nearly impossible to keep them all up to date.So that's about it.  A great brand that has sort of petered out, sadly.As you ponder that, why not reflect on the man who used to make your old rigs.  Stephen Ward, the 26 year IBM veteran.  According to the article (see below), he grew up in Santa Maria along the California coastline.  As a kid he worked in his father's gas station, pumping gas and washing windows.  Then he went to Cal State San Luis Obispo to get his engineering degree (I hear they have a great engineering school).  From there he went to IBM.  Neatly sporting his IBM lapel on his old fashioned suit.  For 26 years maintaining the IBM culture of superior products, quality control and no nonsense values.You know, I bet the Lenovo guys are just as good.[...]", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good purchase", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R3ELM5EVS0JUKZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Thinkpad represents excellent value for money - providing top-end capacity and quality for substantially less than the models of most competitors.
