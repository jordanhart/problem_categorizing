{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far, so good", "Author": "Pippa Lee", "ReviewID": "R2KW0N2M8L960H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since Microsoft is ready to pull the plug on its Windows XP this coming April, I decided I needed to buy a new computer. They have made it clear that it is not going to be safe to surf the Internet and do online transactions once WIN XP is no longer updated. Instead of a traditional desktop tower, I decided to give myself more mobility and location flexibility by buying a laptop.My computer needs are pretty basic: Internet surfing, word processing, light photo editing and the occasional DVD watching.  The Lenovo B590 has so far fulfilled all those needs pretty well.  This laptop has a plastic case and a matte finish that means I don't have to be afraid of leaving unsightly fingerprints or oil marks all over it.  However, I have to admit that the Lenovo B590 is not the sexiest or most exciting-looking laptop either.  It's actually rather plain looking.  It weighs a little over 5 lbs. and if you plan to buy one of those tight sleeves to protect it, make sure the sleeve stretches to at least 1 1/2\" to accommodate the laptop thickness.  What you get in the box is the laptop, the battery pack, power cord, and ac power adapter and a sheet of paper with the initial setup instructions and an illustration of the controls and indicators of the laptop.  If you want a manual or user guide, you have to download it from the Lenovo website.Setting up the laptop was easy.  I had no problems configuring WIN 7. I just followed the instructions on the screen.  The laptop had no difficulty identifying and connecting to my wi-fi home network.  Until I get a wireless mouse, I've plugged a USB-corded mouse to the laptop and it's working fine along with the touch pad.  This laptop comes preloaded with Adobe Reader X, Nitro Pro 8, Evernote installer, Skype, Lenovo tool suites to manage and check for updates from the maker, a free trial of McAfee Internet Security and a limited-time free subscription to Lenovo Cloud Storage. It doesn't come with any Office starter but there's a quick link if you're interested in purchasing it or in trying Office 365 free for a limited time.  Since MS Office is so expensive, I've downloaded the free, open source LibreOffice suite instead and it fits my word processing needs for the time being. The battery lasts me about 4 or 4 and half hours. The laptop gets warm underneath but not hot.  My brother actually complimented the keyboard of the Lenovo. He said it was better designed than his Toshiba laptop.  The tray for the DVD seemed fragile to me. I was afraid it was going to come off completely when I was pulling it further out to put the DVD in it.  The speakers didn't seem impressive to me.  The camera is suitable for Skyping.  The only things that have annoyed me so far are the McAfee pop ups to remind me to buy the their services before the trial period is over; Lenovo's ones, encouraging me to install their Small Business Solution (I'd like to know more about it before doing it) and MS Windows updates that are configured before I even had a chance to sign on to the computer. As I don't use this laptop to play games, I can't tell its performance in that respect.  Other than those pop ups, I'm happy with the B590 laptop.  It works well for my basic computer needs.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with my Lenovo", "Author": "nolan4", "ReviewID": "R1ZJQNGJWIE60W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a desktop and I had no room on my desk to put anything else but the computer but with this laptop I can push it back and have plenty of room. I was recommended to get a Lenovo Laptop and my husband was recommended to get a Lenovo desktop by our computer guru and so far they have been very good. No problem with them at all. I had never heard of Lenovo in my life till our computer man highly recommended it and we looked on the Consumer Report guide and it was rated very high so we bought the two of them.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Love Love", "Author": "crasagam", "ReviewID": "RX7JD90FP6MWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop - and it has Windows 7.

Overall the product has a flimsy feel and the edges of the computer are sharp and uncomfortable when you rest your palm against it.  I would not recommend  this as a business machine you would travel with.  I am not sure it would hold up to the bumps and bruises of the airline overhead bins.It has Windows 7 loaded and that is a huge plus for me.The keyboard layout has the smallest shift key I've ever seen and I find it very difficult to use without looking for it.  That will probably change with time, but it is pretty inconvenient at best.  Track pad works pretty good and I have not adjusted any settings.Access to the ram and HDD are excellent, however,  I have never seen such a thin piece of plastic used to cover the bottom of a computer. Lenovo has managed to produce a very thin plastic and used it for an integral part of the machine.  The cover is lined with a thin layer of metal, so it will probably protect the bottom bits okay,, but it is flimsy with only two very tiny screws holding it in place.I needed a cheap computer and this is what it is,  time will tell how well it stands up to laptop use.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer.", "Author": "kawon59", "ReviewID": "R2GA01UGCJMJ23", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a great computer.

Brown Jr.", "ReviewID": "R15GN0Q7VGS3FJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this computer for my wife and so far it is working pretty well.I bought it with 4 GB of RAM already installed, so it seems to work pretty efficiently - many of the other reviewers bought it with only 2GB of RAM and recommended that you add 2 additional Gig of RAM.Actually, after my wife had it for a while, I bought 4 additional GB of RAM from Amazon for about $39.00, so the laptop now has a total of 8GB of RAM.The laptop is very very light, so it's really easy to carry around.My wife uses it to run other apps (i'm not sure which ones) and she said that this laptop runs faster than her previous model (A Toshiba Satellite with Windows 7, an AMD CPU, and 4 GB of RAM.When you first get the laptop, you will get a few popups and you to extend the license (only when the license gets close to expiring). But since they have expired, I haven't noticed any more popups.I think that this is a really good consumer laptop for the price and would give it 5 stars, but we haven't had it long enough to determine if something will stop working or break before we expect it to.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "great laptop", "Author": "Kim Hankins", "ReviewID": "R17U6GI7LXH1BA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This machine is all that we expected.

It did ask about installing this and that but I could just say no and it obeyed.The keyboard is surprisingly noisy, it could be a problem at night if you do not want to disturb others while typing. The laptop surfaces are not glossy but the screen is.The build quality is somewhat cheap, it doesn't have a stylish look. For the price, it has an acceptable look though.It's silent during normal operation and it doesn't heat up.

Then it wouldn't charge the battery. Once the battery died, it sat for 3 days, and just like easter, it rose from the dead and charged to 100%.Had any number of techs look at it....battery was fine, charger was fine....seemed to be a driver issue.....replaced the OS, replaced the drivers......After many many hours of diagnostics, it died, never to charge again.
