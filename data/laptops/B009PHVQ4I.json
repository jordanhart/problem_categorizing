I do need that - and it had to be Windows based because of the solids modeling software I run.  At home I connect it to a 27 inch screen, keyboard, and speakers, but away from home it is just the laptop and the 17 inch screen does nicely.  Away from home, I carry it and other stuff in a Case Logic backpack made for a 17\" laptop.It is robust structurally and functionally and does everything I have to do.  I use it in a home office with no computer support.  The HP EliteBooks are made with the assumption that you use it in a corporate environment.  The security built into it can be a bit much to manage for a one person office.  For the most part, you can just go with the default or recommended settings.  At times I miss having an IT person.  But it hasn't been a barrier.  At least once that security saved me from opening a toxic email attachment in an email from a friend - and I thought I was too smart for that kind of thing.  It surprised me that, in this case, the HP security refused to let me open it - I saw no option to override.  I contacted the friend and, sure enough, he found a virus that had taken over his email.In one instance, I had a problem with a Microsoft product - either Windows or Office - and could not get either Microsoft or HP to decide it was their problem.  I finally found the solution on-line, so in the end - no harm, no foul.I had been using an iMac running Bootcamp and Windows 7.  This HP runs Windows 7 (the Elitebooks come loaded with 7 rather than 8 assuming that will be the corporate choice - and they are right).  It has been more stable than the Mac.  I have yet to have a hiccup with it and the graphics look much better.This computer will do me for at least the next few years that I will need its functionality and I was able to find it from a discount seller who held up their end by getting it to me quickly and in good condition.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "HP EliteBook 8770w 17.3\" Core i7 Notebook", "Name": "EliteBook 8770w C6Y81UT 17.3\" LED Notebook - Intel - Core i7 i7-3630QM 2.4GHz - Gunmetal", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ogLhNqFaL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009PHVQ4I"}}
