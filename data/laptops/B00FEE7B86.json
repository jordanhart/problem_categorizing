{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Had high hopes, but your results may vary.", "Author": "ridgerider", "ReviewID": "RZT1DE299SV0M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First off -- The general description and details/shipping for this listing are off. It obviously doesn't weigh 5.5 lbs and shipping weight can't be 1 lb. :-) The device is 2.5 lbs on its own and the shipping wt is likely the 5 lb figure with power supply and packaging.3.5 stars is what I'd really prefer to post at this time. It's better than okay and I like it, but...My initial experience with this unit (i5/4G/128G model, direct from Dell) was mostly positive. The build quality is excellent and screen resolution is great, but things went a bit downhill during my first 30 days. Here's my cons list with details.\"Display driver has stopped responding and has recovered.Intel HD Graphics driver.\"This problem occurs randomly upon wake-up after the screen powers off due to sleep mode.Upgrading the driver from Dell's support site has no effect. Upgrading from Intel's driver site doesn't work (\"you must obtain driver from your unit manufacturer to ensure compatibility\" or something like that).Periodically touchscreen functionality is lost returning from sleep mode. Only a restart fixes this which you can only get to using Ctrl-Alt-Del. Sometimes you have to force a restart (power button). This might be related to the display driver issue, but there is no error in this case. Sometimes there is a partial response meaning a press on the Windows Start icon on the touchscreen gives you a haptic response, but does not return you to the Modern UI screen. At that point you're lucky if Ctrl-Alt-Del gets you the screen where you can restart.BSOD error has occurred 3x since purchase identifying an issue with igdkmd64.sys. This is apparently Intel graphics related as well.On/off button is oddly placed and a bit too easy to bump by mistake, especially if you're couch sitting and getting up and down frequently or switching between laptop/tablet modes. The power button would have been better located on the outside edge near the hinge, or at least indented so it cannot be bumped by mistake.Make sure all your favorite Windows apps can handle high resolution (2560x1440) graphics. Some old desktop apps won't unless there is an update available. Otherwise screen forms will be unreadable with tiny or oddly placed text. Luckily for me this is only one app, but it is something I use every day.Another issue I ran into is my remote desktop tool of choice (GotoAssist) can lockup up the PC in wakeup-from-sleep mode, apparently trying to sync screen displays between local and remote. When that happens only Ctrl-Alt-Del with a restart gains control back.Keyboard works fine most of the time, but results can vary depending on how you hold or rest the unit on your lap. There is a sweet spot or two that works best whereas a normal keyboard with keys that travel is more forgiving.I don't think speed typists are going to like the keyboard if their work relies on fast typing without errors. I'm not a touch typist and the keyboard works fine for me. The Delete key requires a purposeful tap in my experience. That may be because it's smaller and near the edge.TIP: You can adjust key sensitivity and turn off the sound by pressing F10 key (disabling the sound will undoubtedly be your first tweak).A screw fell out!! Luckily I had the unit resting on a cream colored ottoman when this happened or I would have lost the tiny black screw for sure or not noticed it fell out. Worse -- ALL of the other screws were loose with a second one about to fall out. This leads me to believe my unit was dis-assembled for some reason before shipping. Mine is one of the first shipments (12/12/2013). From what I gather reading the Dell and laptop review forums, there may have been some changes made prior to shipping (or will be if you need one replaced or repaired under warranty).I highly suggest anyone who purchased one of these units to check the tightness on the screws. Otherwise they may go missing and you won't notice until it's too late.TIP: Teeny-Turner micro driver happens to have the right size torx mini bit for the screws.Something interesting I discovered while tightening the screws -- There are two strong magnetic spots on the bottom outside edge of the keyboard. One on the right near the power button and the other on the opposite left side. Try holding a bottle cap underneath and you'll see what I mean. Was this possibly intended to clamp the unit together in tablet mode but never implemented? There are no corresponding spots on the screen half to attract the magnets. The halves fold together in tablet mode, but loosely and not evenly in my experience. Magnets on both halves would have resolved that and added some snap to tablet mode. I would have liked that as a feature.Dell's self-service driver upload site doesn't appear to jive with the drivers installed. Yet you can't necessarily update from that site. The drivers on the site show one date and earlier dates in Windows but simply won't install (\"already running suggested driver\").I had continuous issues with sound disappearing and finally had to request Dell support via chat. That worked out well, but the rep had to logon to my unit and visit the manufacturer's site to download an audio driver update and install it. That site was dead slow to download a 60 meg installer (required three attempts). After the install and reboot, audio has been working fine since. But this means the audio driver download on Dell's support center is not current.The power plug tends to drift out a bit if you leave it plugged at handle the unit much. Not enough to halt charging, but why can't everyone adopt a magnetic connector like the iPad and Surface? It's a better design -- period.After much banter on the forums, it's official -- the XPS 11 does NOT support an active stylus. That is no big deal to me, but obviously a factor for those looking for stylus support.The hinge has a bit of play to it. It is not loose by any means, but when you push back the screen for laptop mode you need to tug it back forward and let go to get things right. If you pick-up the unit quickly while in laptop mode, the screen flops back. I'd prefer a stiffer hinge. Perhaps the Yoga works in similar fashion due to dual hinge design versus weight of the Gorilla Glass screen.Battery life is 4-6 hours in my experience (heavy use including remote connections to multiple PCs). I was hoping for more.They could have sized this unit about an inch smaller. It is almost the same size as my HP Folio 13. There's 3/4 inch of black around the screen on three sides and an inch at the bottom. I understand the need for the Windows Start button at bottom for tablet mode, but 1/4\" extra would have been fine. That means the unit could have been about inch smaller in both dimensions with the same size screen. I would have preferred that.Pros:- Premium quality build (other than the loose screws)- Nice feel to it- Backlit keyboard works just fine for me (am not a touch typist)- Screen resolution makes it easy to read tiny type, even at a distance- Excellent touchpad with default settings- Neat power supply travel plug (no need to carry a power cable)- Runs fairly cool- Decent sound (needed audio driver update from the manufacturer)Bottom line: Would I buy the XPS 11 again? Probably, but only if the operating glitches mentioned above are resolved and the screws are tight. ;-)Update 4/4/2014: NO WAY would I buy this unit again. Between the too-easy-to-bump power button, intermittent loss of cursor/kb control during wake-up, almost daily weirdness if you don't reboot it the morning, and twice a month BSOD's, it just doesn't live up to its promise.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "This sets the standard for high end convertible laptops!", "Author": "gtucker7848", "ReviewID": "RCVGDLIUOLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the XPS 11 direct from the Dell website, and have been using it now for four days. I had been using a Lenovo Yoga 11s for three weeks, but will be sending it back for a refund. Here's why.The Dell XPS 11 is more expensive. I upgraded to the 256gb SSD and paid $1,249. This is about $400 more than the Yoga 11s, and most of the other internal specs are identical, including a Core i5 processor, and 4gb of memory. The reasons for justifying the increased price are twofold.First, the display on the XPS 11 is simply the best currently available. It is true QHD, with a resolution of 2560X1440. Worth noting is the fact that the Google Chrome web browser (when installed on the desktop) runs flawlessly. This has been a well noted compatibility issue with other QHD displays, including the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro.Second, the build quality and form factor of the XPS 11 is by far superior. The XPS 11 is made from carbon fiber and machined aluminum. These material choices make it the lightest 11.6\" convertible laptop on the market. It is over a half a pound lighter than the Yoga 11s, which makes it much more comfortable to use in the tablet mode. Additionally, the keyboard palm rest is made of silicone, and is very comfortable when typing.One place where the Lenovo Yoga 11s may be preferable for some is in the keyboard. The Lenovo keyboard is a quality standard chiclet style keyboard. Experienced typists will feel very comfortable on it. The Dell XPS 11 uses an innovated touch style keyboard that will likely take some getting used to. One advantage of the touch keyboard on the XPS 11 is that it is beautifully backlit using automatic sensors. The Yoga 11s keyboard is not backlit. (really Lenovo?!?!) Additionally, the XPS 11 has several adjustable settings that will provide various levels of feedback (both haptic and audio) with each keystroke. I am quickly growing to like this new style of keyboard very much. That said, if your lively hood depends on fast and effective typing from the get go, this laptop might not be for you.Here are a few additional quick comparisons:Audio quality---advantage XPS 11Track pad quality--advantage XPS11Hinge quality--advantage Yoga 11s (though I haven't used either long enough to comment on durability)Internet speeds--huge advantage XPS11As a final comment, I think both of these devices are of very high quality. At the end of the day, I think your best choice depends on your personal needs. If you need a device to function as a laptop 75% of the time, and double as an occasional media consumption tablet, than the Lenova Yoga 11s is probably your best bet. If, on the other hand, you desire the best Windows 8 11.6\" tablet on the market, with the ability to get some lite work done in laptop mode, than the XPS 11 is as good a device as you can buy on today's market.My Yoga 11s gets returned tomorrow.I will be happy to answer any questions.Tuck*****UPDATE: 30 DAY REVIEW*****I've been using this device for a bit over a month now, and my opinion remains unchanged. This device is certainly best in class. I've covered all the very positive attributes that this device offers, including the display, the form factor, the audio quality, and the amazing connectivity and processor speed aspects. I will use this review to point out all of the minor flaws that I have encountered with this device. While none of these flaws are deal breakers, they have resulted in me lowering my final rating to 4.5 stares (though it will remain 5 stars on the listing, as Amazon does not allow for half star ratings.)*The display periodically freezes and requires a reboot. This happened approximately once a day during the first week I used the device. Upon updating all the recommended drivers, this issue has become less prevalent, now happening just a couple of times a week. Interestingly, this problem generally occurs when waking the device from a prolonged sleep. I recommend shutting the device down when not in active use. Also, this freezing issue always take place when working on the desktop. I have yet to encounter the issue when working in any of the native Windows 8 apps. When the device does freeze, both the start icon at the bottom of the screen, and the dedicated start key on the keyboard, are both still active, and will return you to the start screen. While the display remains frozen, the charms bar is still able to be activated. I simply select \"restart\", and the device reboots and works properly.*Speaking of the drivers, Dell's update process is ridiculous. When you check for driver updates, it lists all the recommended drivers for the device. The issue is that it fails to list what version of each driver is currently installed. When I updated all 15 recommended driver packages, only three were actually outdated. This is one hour of my life that I will never get back! hopefully this get changed in the near future, as many have complained about it on the Dell discussion forums.*There are compatibility issues within Windows 8 regarding this device and my all-in-one desktop PC. When I signed into my Windows 8 account on this device, the existing arrangement of the tiles on my desktop PC was not transferred properly. When I arranged the tiles properly on the XPS 11, they then looked ridiculous on my desktop PC. I had to change some of the tile sizes and placements in order to come up with a compromise that is reasonable on both devices. Content integration within multiple devices is one area that Google is still miles ahead of Microsoft.*Some of the native Windows 8 apps are not fully compatible with desktop sources. For example, Windows 8 has a very useful built in future called \"reading list\". Any article or web page you are reading can be easily saved to the reading list using the share icon on the charms bar. The reading list is then available for offline use. However, the reading list option is not available when working on the desktop. This is very unfortunate for anyone who uses chrome bookmarks for research or news browsing. Also, Google Calendar does not sync with the Windows 8 calendar app. I wish Google and Microsoft would get over this silly feud already!*Due to the QHD display, some more advanced websites are not fully compatible with the desktop. This also applies to some advanced software packages. It is worth noting that these compatibility issues are not deal breakers, as they are on other QHD devices such as the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro. For an example, when I use YouTube through the Chrome browser on the desktop, some of the minor navigational icons simply do not work. However, using YouTube through Internet Explorer (which is a native app) works flawlessly. My recommendation is to use Internet Explorer for any websites that do not work properly on a alternative desktop browser. As a hardcore Google services user myself, I've started using Internet explorer as opposed to the desktop to access Google sites. With regards to desktop software, any downloads that make use of excessive drop down menus, or very crowded navigational fields, will very likely not be compatible with this device. Of course, there is always the option of using this device with an external monitor. As you can see by the listed specs, this device has got all your desirable ports covered.*Another minor display issue I have noticed is that when I use my finger to scroll a page that has a white background, my finger motion results in a very small discolored streak that is visible on the display for a brief second. The \"tail\" so to speak, is only about a half inch long, and leaves absolutely no permanent mark. I does not concern me in the least, and the only reason I mention it is because I have never encountered this issue on any other device.*With regards to the form factor, I have only one very minor complaint. The screen face is not flush with the aluminum strip that surrounds it. This could be moderately uncomfortable for some when holding the device in tablet mode. Additionally, this small ridge around the outside of the screen is a bit of a dust and dirt collector. Before you let this scare you away, keep in mind that this is built this way to allow for very easy display replacement. This could be a plus if you intend on using this device for multiple years.As a final analysis, let me state that the above mentioned flaws are nothing more that nitpicking. This device falls into a form factor that is still in it's revolutionary stages. If you are looking for complete perfection, you simply will not find it. This device has been a real joy to use, and has absolutely changed my perception of both Windows 8 as a viable mobile OS, and Dell as a viable company for the future.As always, fire away with any questions.Tuck", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast Laptop but Movie Picture Quality is a Let Down", "Author": "intellectually_stupid \"iisgenius\"", "ReviewID": "R2S7AII1YU94F5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really love this xps 11. It's fast, well-built, flexible, keyboard layout is superb, back-lit keyboard, very light, and absolutely gorgeous.

I adjusted the colors and brightness but it still subpar (My sony pro 11, which is 1440p) has a much better picture quality than this. I also called Dell tech support for assistance but there was no improvement. I don't if I got a lemon but I am going to return this. I will purchase the Lenovo Yoga pro 2 as it's picture quality is amazingly clear and crisp.

I tend to use it primarily without the keyboard, just because I'm lazy and like to work from bed, but whenever I have to actually get down to business, i really like snapping it into the keyboard.
