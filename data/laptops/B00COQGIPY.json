I doesn't come with a Core i7 4500u processor, it comes with a Core i7 3537u, also it does not have a 1TB hard drive it is only a 500GB hard drive. I have not decided yet if I am going to return it or not but I am going to wait a day and see it it works out for me.8/15/2013Well I have been using the laptop for a few weeks now and I like it a lot. The only minor problem I have seen is that at times the glossy screen has a reflection which makes it hard to see, but other then that I like the laptop. Overall I think Asus made a good product and Amazon was too lazy to check there listing before they put it online.", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Different to what I ordered - Satisfied in the end", "Author": "Gavin Mandy", "ReviewID": "RLMYTAXJMALGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What I ordered was a notebook with an I7-4500 CPU and 1TB hard drive and instead I got a I7-3537 CPU with a 500GB hard drive. These are not desciption mistakes, but rather fundamental differences - what was delivered is a fundamentally different machine to what was ordered.UPDATE - 7 Aug 13In the end I kept the machine and was impressed with how Amazon handled this issue. I see that they have now updated the website to more acurately reflect what was delivered, however, right at the bottom of the product description it still seems incorrect.Overall I am very happy with the machine - for a 15.6\" machine it is lightweight and thin and an example of this is that you can easily sit with it on your lap for as long as is needed without the machine becoming heavy or hot. The screen size makes working for extended periods of time a breeze and the touch screen is great. There is no optical disk so if you need one you would need to order additionally.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Computer, Works perfectly I think..", "Author": "Jake", "ReviewID": "RK7YPCF9X47BW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works perfectly...

I personally like to press the space bar on the bottom right corner lightly.  But the space bar in the V500CA would often miss the key press.  After doing a lot of searching for this space bar problem, it appears to be the key not being sensitive enough.  After being annoyed with it for a couple of days, I finally decided to fix it once and for all.  I pulled the space bar out very carefully since it is very easy to break.  After the space bar plastic is off, I immediately saw the problem.  There is only one single actual key and it is in the center on the space bar.  When pressing on the corner slightly, it causes the key to press at a slightly off angle.  This cause the key press not to register.  The fix is very simple.  I just put 2 layers of clear tape inside the space bar plastic to make the contact better.  So far, it has been working fine.  Space bar is very sensitive.  Hope this will help anyone having trouble with their space bar.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty great", "Author": "Penny \"Penny\"", "ReviewID": "R2QOWYORR4TAJ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm quite enjoying my new laptop thus far. It's light weight, it's fast, and it's pretty easy to use.

I wanted one with a CD drive, the one that I saw had everything including the CD drive but when i got my pc there was no CD drive. When I revisited amazon website where it is sold I saw in the very FIIIIIINE PRINTS that this model doesnt have a CD drive. So they are fooling customers, showing u a \":model laptop\" with everything for an awesome price, so u think u are getting a \"great deal\" when in fact its not that way. Should I BE FOOLED BECAUSE I WANT A \"GREAT DEAL\" in this hard economic times. SHAMEFUL!!!!!To make matters worst when i got the pc, the battery stopped working ABOUT ONE WEEK AFTER.....it just stopped hold charge, i figured been new it may take awhile but after about 4 days  I realized the problem  was  NOT resolving. I contacted the seller through Amazon( approximately 11 dys after delivery), the buyer took about 10 days to respond and when he did his advice leaned towards me loosing my warranty LUCKILY I READ MY WARRANTY CARD BOOKLET so i didn't \"tamper\" with the computer as he wanted me to do. So when i responded with my concerns and told him that i wanted to return the product I WAS TOLD THAT THE LAPTOP WAS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR RETURN B/C 30 DYS HAVE PASSED SINCE DELIVERY and me initializing the \"return\" before the 30 dys DOESNT HELP THE SITUATION. So that's why the seller waited soooooo long to repsond the first time....hoping that my 30 days would run out.I cannot believe that this has happened and I will continue to write BAAAAAAD REVIEWS ABOUT THIS PRODUCT AND THE SELLER.
