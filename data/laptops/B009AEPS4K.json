{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wonderful Budget Laptop", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RHXEVCBE2V5KL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a medium-sized laptop that I could take to college with me. I wanted something that had decent battery life, and one that was able to play most of my video games on at least medium settings. I have a large, dual monitor gaming set-up with a gaming desktop, so I have that to play all my graphic-intensive games on ultra settings, but I wanted to be able to do school work and some play on the go. This laptop performs extremely well. I can play minecraft, league of legends, warframe, etc, on Medium-high settings with no lag. Web pages seem to load faster on this. It's quiet, but the fan does kick in when you switch it to high-performance mode and get gaming.It took me a while to get used to Windows 8, because my desktop is still at 7, but once you do, it isnt too bad. I miss having a regular start button, but they are supposedly coming out with 8.1, a free update that will give you the old functionality. Sometimes I feel like I'm using a tablet more than a laptop.The speakers on this thing are amazing, They have dolby home theater speakers on the front, and a built-in software to control surround sound and what it sounds like with headphones/without headphones. Truly amazing sound. I love it.The battery life is NO where near 5 hours. That is a complete lie. I get maybe 3.5 hrs on \"power saver\" mode, and maybe 2.5 on \"High performance\" mode. However, I rarely am without a power outlet, so this isnt too big of an issue to me.This laptop starts up lightning fast, has amazing hard drive space, and a decent amount of RAM which can be easily upgraded.The only thing I've found that bothers me is Skype. Once you sign into the Skype app with one account, you have to log out completely from microsoft and your email, etc, to log into another one. So far, it only lets me download the skype app, and not actual software to use on the desktop. A major pain for me since I have a personal family skype account, as well as a gaming one without personal information. I can't easily switch between them.I did not buy this from Amazon, I bought mine from an actual store for about $80 less.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great laptop great price!", "Author": "anthony", "ReviewID": "R2SB6UQXU8QZY9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i bought this laptop looking for something that would be able to do a lot for the price. when i got the laptop i started testing it out right away everything i threw at it wouldn't slow it down at all. i have plated assassins creed: brotherhood, GTA: IV, minecraft, and bioshock infinite at default settings with no lag at all and 60 fps the only time i has frame rate problems was when i tried recording gameplay using fraps which was too much for the processor to handle. as with the wifi it does seem slower than my old laptop its fast enough that it doesn't bother me but for you internet speed junkies a $20 usb wifi card can fix that. 4 stars for speed/gaming capabilities -1 star for slower wifi", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, great price", "Author": "ggrrqq", "ReviewID": "RYXN84K8NH5WR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this laptop. It plays all my games like BF4, Assassin's Creed IV, and Saints Row IV on medium settings. I bought it for $500, and it gets performance almost comparable to Lenovo's y510p.Pros:-Large touchpad-Great graphics-Decent processor-Good keyboard-GREAT speakers-Number pad-USB 3.0-Great priceCons:-Gets slightly hot during gaming, not even close to an overheat though.-Not much space between arrow keys and normal keyboard-Battery life could be improved, I get 4-5 hours on battery saver mode.Verdict:In my opinion, this is the best gaming laptop you can buy for under $600.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Useful", "Author": "Jessica Martinez", "ReviewID": "R1X1L4K9D8S5I7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "stylish, fast and quick shipment.

I don't do much gaming, but it can handle what few games I did throw at it. The keyboard is fantastic, yet as with many laptops, takes a bit of getting used to with respect to they layout of things. The only reasons this laptop is getting a 4/5 from me are because of the 5400rpm hard drive. It really feels like the bottleneck for the machine, which isn't too noticeable, but it would increase the speed of loading the OS and applications. An easy \"fix\". Also, the touchpad isn't so great. Maybe I haven't found the exact settings I need yet, but I can't seem to get it to cooperate 100%. It's still jumpy. I mostly use a mouse anyway, but to use the laptop without a mouse I can foresee as being incredibly frustrating.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Supper machine", "Author": "Rik", "ReviewID": "R2TTTZHRLCYYCO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Description honest and accurate.

I purchased it for use with a computer course that I am taking this summer. It worked fine for 2 weeks. The sound and display were great.Just two weeks after I received the thing, it died and will not power on. I was working on battery power when it ran low, I plugged it in. 20 minutes later, it powered off. I searched the web and visited Lenovo's website and discovered that this is a VERY common problem with IDEAPADs.I tried all of the troubleshooting techniques found...including removing the battery and charging and pressing the power button several times at varying rates to release the static charge that may linger when the system powers off abruptly. I called customer service and must now mail it to Lenovo at my expense. It will take 7 days to repair. I have school projects due that I need this computer for and school projects lost now on the hard drive. OF COURSE Best Buy has an unconscionable return policy of 15 days from original purchase (note is took almost that long to get the computer to me despite paying expedited shipping), so now I have no options and no PC.In the future, I will purchase from Amazon or other companies who stand behind the products they sell and accept returns or exchanges within 30 days, which is the standard. I am very disappointed and disgusted with both Lenovo and will no longer buy their products.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009AEPS4K"}}
