However, the laptop was in worse condition than described by the seller: on the outside everything was nice and shiny, but I guess nobody bothered to dust the inside of the poor thing. It took me about 20 minute and two cans of compressed air to make it look \"normal\"; the laptop came with a few missing screws, so I had to buy those as well; it coms with Windows XP Pro, SP1, so you'll need to do ALL the updates in the past 5 years.

Windows XP will always be BETTER than all other operating systems. Yeah I said it! From my experience with the more advanced windows such as windows 7/Vista they have always been too faulty with all sorts of random errors: Slow starting up, Trouble/Slow connecting, freezing, blank outs screens, the list just goes on & on. So random, Its annoying. I find that they over-do it with the more advanced systems, I really don't think most laptops are designed to handle all that. I much prefer this in Windows XP(Pro)! I find its more concrete, more sturdy, & I can turn them on with no surprises waiting for me. I have had very few troubles with it so far: Its fast, large screen, nice to look at, reliable, easy to customize. It even connected to my wireless internet right away & with no prompt. The battery life is decent as well though I always keep it plugged anyway. The only problem is this tea kettle whistling noise the battery occasionally makes when plugged but I hardly notice it most of the time. This is a win win for me in terms of price & quality esp since I find this better than any of the more expensive brands. What a Steal. Ofcourse the RAM, Free space & Memory is pretty small but that doesn't matter for me since I don't plan on downloading or saving much of anything at all. I'm sure I'll have to be very careful with this thing. I just hope the computer never crashes on me, that's my only concern.  But good so far. Highly Recommended it. :)", "Date": "January 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Refurbished IBM T43 Think Pad", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "RFNVTDHBXWRF5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received the laptop in a short period of time.

Now, if you're looking for something sleek and futuristic this laptop is not for you, but if you want to listen to music, stream videos, do some word-processing and browse the web this computer is perfect. The wireless also works great. I can't believe it was under $200. It was worth every penny. I bought this when my HP laptop crapped out. It was a little over three years old. I can't afford a new computer right now and needed something just for those basic functions I listed above. The computer's old so the battery doesn't really hold a charge. It's also not the lightest so I don't leave home with it very often. It runs Windows XP, so you can't install some recent and complicated software (ex. I couldn't install the software for my Zune mp3 player, but I had no problem with Spotify). These are the only minor complaints that I have. The only thing that I wish it had is a webcam, but that's not a big deal. I don't really Skype that much anyway. This laptop gives you more than enough bang for your buck.

This is really just a back up for me and all I really need to do is surf the net, send emails maybe watch an occasional video. It's running great, surfs the net with good speed, boots up pretty quickly. The only thing that seems a little lacking is the battery life. I usually have it plugged in anyway so it's not a big deal for me, but I used it for a while last night running on the battery just to test out the life. Not terrible but not great. It lasted a couple hours before I had to plug it back in. All things considered, I am very happy with this laptop.

I got mine from U.S. Micro and couldn't get the wifi working. An email from their tech support stated that they check their machines for wifi card being installed before they ship, but sometimes they forget. I got one without the wifi circuit card, and they promptly replaced the laptop with another that did. Just remember, Amazon's T43 web page indicates wifi as being a built-in feature, but it is NOT. You need to check with the seller before you buy. Also need to make sure it comes with the correct driver installed, otherwise you'll need another computer to download it. (note: according to U.S. Micro, there are two possible wifi cards, the IBM and the Intel. You need to install the correct driver for your particular wifi circuit card)Who knows what else might be listed as a standard feature, but isn't really? I can't tell yet; everything else seems to work okay so far on my machine. The T43 can come in various configurations, and it comes in two different screen sizes (14.1 inch and 15 inch).This laptop gets pretty hot after 30 minutes or so.Two USB ports is a little skimpy for some people. Consider a USB hub, or the T60/T61 which has three USB ports. Other than USB, has oodles of I/O ports, even a good old-fashioned IrDA for hotsyncing my Clie and Handera PDAs.Otherwise, this is a reliable and solidly built computer. Good performance even being some 7 years old. A champ!

It wasn't much, but usually refurbished computers won't have anyone's old data at all. Keep in mind that by current standards, the disk drive is small and the processor is slow.
