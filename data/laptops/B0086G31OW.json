{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Acer laptop FAR exceeded my expectations!  I am thrilled to own and use it.  It is the best electronic device I ever bought.", "Author": "richard e stetzel", "ReviewID": "RN7QTJOOXOPDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose the 5 star rating because it deserves nothing less.  The included apps are mind boggling.  The set up was a breeze.  It is rapid in the search mode and super easy to work with.  I would recommend this highly.  It has more features than I know what to do with.  I will be learning how to use features that my previous computers did not include for a long time.  Buy one!  It has windows 7 which is easy to use.  I tried my sisters laptop with windows 8 and it sucks!  It is not a joke that windows 8 is something to give to someone you hate.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Acer Travelmate", "Author": "Winston S Ray", "ReviewID": "R7IN5GO3WA2CN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great laptop. very happy. nothing else to say on the subject, other than having a mandatory minimum number of words makes me very unlikely to do this again", "Date": "February 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Limited Warranty\nAcer NX.V5NAA.002\nAcer TravelMate TM5744Z-4603 15.6 LED Notebook Intel Pentium P6200 2.13GHz 4GB DDR3 320GB HDD DVD-Writer Intel HD Graphics Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "Acer TravelMate TM5744Z-4603 15.6 LED Notebook Intel Pentium P6200 2.13GHz 4GB DDR3 320GB HDD DVD-Writer Intel HD Graphics Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31ApxBzpRqL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0086G31OW"}}
