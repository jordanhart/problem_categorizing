I figured I'd shell out at least $600, so I researched for weeks. Finally, I wrote down some sku numbers of highly rated laptops, including this one, and went to BestBuy, and tried out all the laptops I was interested in. I NEVER thought I'd be buying the cheapest one there, and one with a Celeron processor?!?! Amazingly, this laptop was the one I chose, and I promise you it's worth it -- as long as you're not playing Crysis or something. I wanted a laptop that could run Photoshop, Fruityloops (music-making software), have a great display, surf the net fast, and be fast while running several applications. And it does! It is very fast, the display is AMAZINGLY bright and crisp, and it does all I want it to. I did just order another 4gb stick of RAM for forty bucks, but even without more RAM you'll still be very pleased. And it's only 229 at bestbuy. So, overall I got a super laptop with a total of 8GB RAM and a 500gb (!) hard drive for less than three hundred bucks! Now that's what I call AWESOME. The Three things that I didn't like (but are all repairable) was Windows 8's UI. It stinks big time. So I quickly switched to \"classic\" view and downloaded a startup button -- problem solved, runs and looks like Windows 7. Next, the sound card drivers STINK when you first buy this laptop -- no bass, tinny sound, horrible (even with headphones, no bass). Just Google Realtek HD Audio drivers and update the drivers -- problem solved, sounds excellent. Lastly, bloatware. Took about a half-hour to uninstall. Get rid of Norton, install free internet security software (I did ZoneAlarm). The battery will give you about 2.5 hours on a charge with brighter screen settings. I've rambled too much. Get this laptop, you won't regret it!UPDATE 11/17/13: Hello again everyone. Just wanted to give a quick update on the laptop. It's been two weeks since I bought it, and I am still just as pleased with it as when I first bought it. Still super fast, beautiful, and a pleasure to use.I've been getting lots of questions and comments from some very nice people, and I've heard nothing but good stuff from their experiences. I encourage you to read some of those comments about their experiences with this laptop.I wanted to make this computer my music-making machine, and it performs flawlessly. Just bought an Audio-Technica AT2020 USB Condenser USB Microphone and it worked the second I plugged it in. Running Audacity to record vocals (with media player running in the background) and again, works without a flaw. Rendering songs in Image-Line Software Image Line FL Studio Fruity Edition 11 is noticeably faster than my last laptop (also a duel-core).I transferred about 230gb of files from my backup external hard drive and was amazed at how fast the files transferred. Less than 15-20 minutes I believe.As with any new laptop, I've been hearing lots of complaints about Windows 8. It's just a bad interface (and OS in general) for a lot a people. There are, however, MANY options to customize your laptop to fit your needs. I needed a classic desktop view with icons, and I needed a start button. Easy to accomplish. I encourage everyone with questions regarding fixing Windows 8's functionality to consult Google. There are many very easy tutorials out there. Personally, now that I've customized my desktop, I don't mind Windows 8 at all. Just takes time to change everything around to your liking.Well, that's my update for now. Perhaps in a month or two I'll say some more. Thanks to everyone for the kind words you've sent me, I appreciate it very much:)", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbeatable Value Computer", "Author": "Computer Expert", "ReviewID": "R88R3AL8F9XQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this computer for my brother, who needed a computer to take with him to school and work. It was important that it was powerful enough to do all of the tasks he needed on the internet, word processing, graphic design and gaming. He didn't want a really expensive computer though, since he is always traveling with it. The screen looks really nice, the keyboard is convenient and comfortable and it is overall very sleak. I think that for the price, this is as good as it gets.  Although it won't run the most high-end games on the highest settings, it will run almost every game he's tried on it (sometimes the graphics details must be tweaked down). We use it to stream games to the television, and it pretty much does everything that is asked of it very quickly. It also runs cool, which is important!

The battery was completely dead, in fact it had grown about a quarter inch thick lump on the underside. Not to mention, I couldn't really keep updating to the latest version of OS X due to barely meeting the new system requirements. I'd been running Linux on it the last few years anyways, and hadn't booted into OS X in as long.I'd been looking at laptops casually for a while at a local retailer, and had a desire to get a new one by or around Christmas time.I actually found a few locally on Craigslist that I considered buying, until my wife pointed me to this one. At the retailer I bought from, it was only $30 more than what I was trying to spend on Craigslist, so I figured why not? I ran to the store that night and picked one up. Aside from some initial frustrations in getting Windows Update to install all updates so I can upgrade to Windows 8.1, this laptop has been a dream.Despite what many people feel are lower specs, the \"quality index\" score or whatever Microsoft calls it was a 4.8, which handily blew away my wife's \"better spec'ed\" HP at 3.9. I'm not a computer gamer, but I've noticed no slowness at all using this laptop. The off to ready to log in time was about 13 seconds, which is slightly faster than what I was getting in Linux under my old MacBook (and HIGHLY improved for any Windows PC in my book).Bottom line, I'm very well pleased with this laptop. The only \"grudge\" I have against it (if you could call it that) is when you're holding it, it truly does feel \"cheap.\" It's a very lightweight plastic, but to be honest I'm not at all concerned about it.

I've managed to beat the deadline for returning the computer by 4 days. Amazon has agreed to pick-up your slack and refund me my money.  This is the second Toshiba I've owned and oddly enough they both have the same problem. My battery should charge when I plug in my power supply. I should not have to turn the computer off, take the battery out, push the power button for 30 seconds, do a rain dance and say 5 prayers to get my computer to run right every time I take it off the charger.I commend you on your selection of your customer service company you outsourced to. I was not fooled though, \"Ivan\" sounded suspiciously Asian. I do not dislike Asians, but don't try to fool me by tagging them with a different name. Some of my best friends are Asian or of Asian decent. I digress.... back to the topic at hand.After purchasing your computer I immediately had problems. Your website said I needed to change the power supply. I did and there was no change in status. Computer still broken.  I tried your all wise website again. It felt I needed to try changing the power supply.... again. No, I'll take the guy with the heavy accent this time. After an hour of waiting and being transferred, the guy was very polite and actually a good credit to your company as I have said earlier, but he was only authorized to tell me to send my computer away to a service center and inform me that I'll get it back in a few weeks.  No thank you. I can do without coffee for a few weeks. I can go without human interaction for weeks. I can't do without quick books for even a few days.  \"Please send me a new computer so that I may transfer files and YOU can have the broken one,\" I said. Better yet, \"Give me a refund so that I may purchase a different brand. You can still have your broken computer.\"Ivan was nice enough to inform me that I had run out of decisions on his end and that repairing their broken computer would still cost me two to three weeks of downtime.  The best he could offer me was an address to Toshiba in California where I could write a letter and let it rot on someone's desk.

If you have much higher expectations than that... I would look elsewhere.  You'd probably want to use earphones/headphones or plug in speakers if you're listening to music.Battery life good for a budget laptop.6 hours of battery life when not doing anything.. idling with the screen on (...cough Lenovo actually uses these numbers in its advertisement...)4-5 Hours of light use battery life...typing up a document, light browsing, reading3 Hours of video watchingSo, decent battery life considering Toshiba is advertising 4...and you actually get 4.  I get half the advertised battery life with my Lenovo.Chassis is a bit big.  Feels like Toshiba could have made this a lot thinner without adding any cost.Budget build quality is really budget.. The whole thing feels hollow.  There's space between the lid and the LCD..So you press behind the screen/on the laptop lid and there's some good room/flex. Lots and lots of room between the system board and the shell too, i think..Could've at least took out a quarter inch from the shell/chassis design while using all the same components.. thinner laptop that isn't any more expensive.Much much much better than the disaster budget HP 630 laptop i bought 2 years ago for $330... that I still use.If you'd a more future-oriented laptop, look for one with USB 3.0 and a Intel 4th generation Haswell chip... Haswell will get you a nice battery life boost..Sound issues with the headphone jack/port can be fixed by fiddling with the sound drivers and/or DTS sound software.If i remember correctly, by default something with the software is screwed up and DTS sound software wasn't switching its modes when you plug in ear/headphones.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good buy for the price.", "Author": "JCliff", "ReviewID": "R50HDABG9GQRO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This computer has its pros and cons.

Also, after all the research I did this computer seemed to be the best computer for the lowest price.Now the cons.  The cons are more annoyances that can be lived with. First, the mouse pad is pretty sensitive.  If you start on the far right side and scroll to your left the start menu will automatically come up.  This can be annoying at first but you just have to train yourself not to to start over so far.  Second, the keyboard is not sensitive enough.  Countless times I have spelled a word wrong because the keyboard didn't pick up that I had typed a letter even though it felt like I had and I felt the key move.  I have just had to learn to be a little harder typer than on my last computer.  Lastly, Windows 8 is annoying.

The computer loads noticeably slower than my three-year-old Dell Latitude, even though Consumer Reports referred to this as a speedy computer.Windows 8 and the entire software environment perform poorly, if, on balance, good enough for my purposes.  This is not a touch-screen model computer so it is hard to blame Windows 8 for not performing at its optimum, given that it is clearly the first Windows intended to run and exploit the new smartphone/touch screen norm.  Even so, the computer loads the various sidebars slowly, and gets rid of them slowly, so that one often feels as if the screen is being obscured and spilling out icons that interfere with one's use of the computer.If one goes to the traditional Windows screen, it works okay, but sometimes one gets, for one reason or another (i.e. for one of several discernible reasons) thrown back to the START screen.  I thought this experience would lessen in frequency or annoyance with time, but we've had this computer for nearly two months now and are still irritated by the way it functions.The main thing I bought this computer for is the speed, and that hasn't impressed.  I still do not like the feel of the keyboard two months in, though I must say it is better to the touch than that array of laptops that has begun creating low, spaced, or virtual keys.I paid way less than even the relatively low amazon price for this: price drove the purchase.

For someone who has mediocre knowledge of computers, it was difficult to get things set to look halfway normal like the old Win XP. Oh, and instead of moving the arrow like you want to, sometimes the screen will zoom in and out or the menus that pop out will select an option without you clicking on anything at all.

Considering my ex and I had just broken up, I was sure that spending a whopping 273$ was a steal I couldn't afford to miss out on before offing myself. After making the purchase, I grew into a huge depression/excitement at the prospect of a new laptop which I'm sure would be passed on to my brother but I digress. I was given a two week delivery wait, which seemed pretty good considering it's the first laptop I've ever owned!Well wouldn't you look at at that, it came in only a week earlier than anticipated, I tell ya my mother has never seen me so happy in such a long time. I even began kissing the box, death was approaching at my pace as I had already bought a bottle of scotch and some sleeping pills, both of which I had never taken in my life time. Looking back on it now, it seems silly.Opening the package, the laptop was secured with large bubble wrap and plastic wrapping which I gave to my sister as my final gift to her as I was soon to leave Earth.After going through all the hoops to create a Microsoft account and actually START up Windows 8 I have to say that this laptop runs extremely smoothly. The interface is simple and it comes with a bunch of apps that I don't really use, however I find myself using SKYPE more than usual to chat with friends.For the most part the keyboard is evenly spaced and a comfortable fit for my hands. I have steam on this laptop and play various games, however nothing that would demand too much from it such as Left 4 Dead and Thief 3.All of the features on this laptop were nigh overwhelming nor underwhelming; I was quite whelmed.I would give this product a 5/5 for it's delivery time and efficiency, however I wasted a good 50 bucks making preparations for my suicide which this laptop was supposed to be used to explain.My depression has been out shined by busyness.Thanks Toshiba, but you owe me 50$good laptop thx", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Batt\\ery will not hold a charge", "Author": "alison", "ReviewID": "R1BG9WZD7LQ3CO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Have had it plugged in for hours yet as soon as it is unplugged it turns off.
