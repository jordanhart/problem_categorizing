Had no issue whatsoever with the screen like another reviewer said, worked great since day 1 for half a year now. Also installed linux ubuntu 11.10 on it, works like a charm - the multitouch on the touchpad in ubuntu also runs great (there's a debian package for that). It's strong, powerful, and despite its tank-like build it's not as heavy as you'd expect. A friend has an older model of the series and 5 years later and a cup of coffee on the keyboard and it still works great.", "Date": "December 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent, but with limitations", "Author": "Jeff", "ReviewID": "R3JR8V9ON1DI57", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm working on a degree in Computer Science and needed a laptop with good processing capability.  After doing some research on the processors out there (I wanted at least an Intel I5), this laptop looked like a good choice for my price-point criteria.  It does have good number crunching capabilities, but when I set up a mysql database on it and ran a database intensive program it maxed out the disk drive access (this is easy to monitor in Ubuntu).  When I checked the programs running the database queries, I found they were using only small percentage of available CPU power.  In other words, this laptop seems to have some IO limitations that keep it from making full use of the CPU (in some applications).Outside of the IO bottleneck the laptop does fine.  The bezel is a bit wide, making the effective screen space smaller, but the screen resolution is decent.  As long as my eyes can make out the smaller fonts it is workable.  The built in webcam and microphone work well.  I tried training the speech recognition software in Windows 7 using the built in mics and it did OK.  Perhaps I can use that later to dictate my dissertation...All in all, I am fairly pleased with the laptop.  I spent some time optimizing the database to see if that will help relieving the disk access limitations.  We'll see how that works.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Solid Business Machine", "Author": "Micah Duchan", "ReviewID": "R2NZWH5NI5A0AM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thia is a solid business machine for the money.Pros:3 Year WarrantyBuilt like a tankI like the rubbery feel of the armrest.Nice High Resolution screen.FastLong battery life - especially with the 9 cell batteryDELL stands behind their products (might take some time on hold but they have been excellent repsonding to my needs in the past)Cons:Touchpad needs to be adjusted in the software for best use - it has many options and I recommend unchecking inertial scrolling.Slightly heavier - 1/2 pound? - than similar 14 inch laptops - I overlook this due to it's obviously better build quality.", "Date": "October 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Notebook!", "Author": "Juan Andr\u00e9s Del Puerto", "ReviewID": "R11QOH26PBAYW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Notebook for people who need durability and trust!It is built with good materials.A little heavy to carry.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wish they were all this good", "Author": "Patriot542", "ReviewID": "R1FAWDPADHUGS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used this laptop for work, 8+ hrs a day, for the last 18 months, and the thing is a rock.  Very stable, fast boot, overall very very happy my employer chose this model.  I have had a number of laptops over the last 10 years, inlcuding Lenovo, Toshiba, Dell, Samsung.

Everything arrived as described but almost a week early.

Great battery life and no hard drive issues. It runs applications quickly whether in Ubuntu 12.x, Windows 7, or even Windows 8. All have run great and without problems. I appreciate the simplicity of the system since it is primarily for business - Office applications, browsing, and email. But there is still plenty of power to work in Photoshop, Lightroom, or other photo/video editing software. Gaming is limited by the built-in graphics card, but I'm sure you could find a few goodies to play on it. The primary downside of the system is the screen resolution - 1366x768. So be sure to get the HD+ which permits 1600x900.It also runs a bit hot, but remains silent even when the fans are working hard.Overall, an aging, but still solid, choice for your business needs and/or limited media work.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Garbage at a high price", "Author": "Floccinaucinihilipilification", "ReviewID": "R15ICUHI68CR3P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Once again, Dell forsakes quality for .... nothing.Immediately on receiving the machine, I had problems with:1. the screen not working properly;2. fingerprint reader not working and no drivers installed;3. headphone jack not working in stereo.After a total of five hours on the line to the incompetent, nonchalant, rude people (who could not understand English) at the call centre, they eventually sent someone round to fix it.  The person who arrived had never looked in their database of solutions and appeared not to know much more than me.  After three visits and replacement of parts (some twice) Dell eventually agreed to replace the machine, but would not help me move my data across.Despite Dell's not having a clue about the screen problem, a simple Google search revealed this has been a known issue for more than 5 years! So much for Dell's service database.As a business-level machine, this Latitude E6420 was not cheap, yet the entire experience was cheap. Dell has chosen to compete using the worst quality parts, cheapest labour and lowest standards of service. Garbage in, garbage out.The fortunate thing about this experience was that I was testing the machine for a corporate purchase to move all our machines from ThinkPads. We now have a corporate policy that no Dell equipment will be permitted in our office.I wrote two reviews on Dell's website. Neither was published. Dell is censoring their website to prevent you knowing how bad their products are.Don't get caught. Avoid Dell's garbage.

It doesn't have a built in camera, so no skype video.  Never even thought to look.  I assumed wrongly that such things were standard these days.2. It doesn't have any system for lighting the keyboard.  Again, most computers don't brag about it but they have some method of lighting the keyboard in the dark.Most people will either have a social life and want skype or will be stuck home at night and want a lit keyboard.  In the event you don't need either there is one final flaw that for me tips this computer over the edge into the \"fatally flawed category\".3. This mouse track-pad is truly awful.  Usually you can adjust your hands slightly and get used to it.  Maybe I'm getting old, but I simply can't.  OH - that's the final kick in the teeth with this machine.  Apparently there is no way of disabling the track-pad.  It features both the IBM-button in the middle of the key board and the track-pad and no way to disable either as far as I can tell.  In theory, if you are hacker you can rewrite some code in the bios-sphere somewhere - or if you prefer hardware you can open the machine and physically unplug it.  Probably, programmers and hackers would already know enough to avoid this machine.", "Date": "June 13, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004UU89TU"}}
