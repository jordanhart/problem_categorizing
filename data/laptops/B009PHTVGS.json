That why I have a feeling of the difference. The mouse pad is smooth to navigate around, and the textured pad making the pointing more accurate and speedy. This 14\" size is small enough to be carried around in a bag and the light weight also facilitate the mobilization (I have to work sometimes inside a Starbuck!). The keyboard is sturdy, so I don't worry about a loosen one (which happened to my old Lenovo). 500 GB is good enough for me, and the 6GB RAM really a big advantage when I have to surf the web with several applications are running. The battery life is far better than my previous laptops (included a Dell, a Sony, and a Lenovo), HDMI port is also a big advantage for the entertainment.Overall, the light weight, sturdy construction, and fast performance, it is a good choice for someone on the go just like me.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "1.8GHz Intel Core I3-3217U Processor\n4GB DDR3 Memory / 500GB Hard Drive\nIntel HD Graphics 4000\nWindows 8", "Name": "HP Pavilion 14-b013nr C2K07UA 14\" LED Ultrabook - Intel - Core i3 i3-3217U 1.8GHz - Sparkling Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41T0MGa82ML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009PHTVGS"}}
