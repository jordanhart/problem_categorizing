{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Basic Computer!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RPU5A5VYXQ4UY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off all, I don't understand the negative reviews! I have had nothing, but positive experiences with this computer. Having said that understand it is a everyday basic computer! It is not for gaming. It does everything it is supposed to do! The speed will depend on your internet provider not the computer. I run mine at 10 mbps as that is the fastest connection in my area currently. This speed is fine for me. I have had NO problems with pages loading or watching Netflix, Youtube, or any other videos! Dvds play flawlessly! Will play Hd content no problem. It has never been laggy or choppy at all. Overall, this for me, was an excellent purchase. I just had to learn how windows 8 works. I mainly use the desktop which mimics Windows 7. I am very picky and for the cost it beats a cheap tablet any day for the week!!! I guess, experience will depend on the person and what you want the computer to do! It meet and exceeded my espectations.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works, but slowly", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "RMGPEYUCVR7TN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a slow, basic computer.  Don't expect it to easily multi-task (do several things at one time), or play the latest games requiring fast graphics.  The processor and cache are just not made to do it.  However, if your needs are minimal: email, Internet searches and online games like Solitaire, this will work for you.You can upgrade the memory in this PC to a maximum of 8GB of RAM by adding (1) 4GB dimm.  Unfortunately it won't help very much in terms of speed, as the processor and cache are also part of the equation.  It will help somewhat with freeze-up problems which you may encounter with only 4GB installed.It does have a media card reader, webcam and HDMI and VGA ports.  Three USB 2.0 ports are nice, but no USB 3.0 (the newest, faster standard) was disappointing, especially since it does have a HDMI port.  The keyboard is full sized, and responsive.There is both a Ethernet port (wired Internet) and Wifi adapter installed.  NO Bluetooth, but you can buy a Bluetooth adapter like this: Kinivo BTD-400 Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapter - For Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Vista which fits in a USB port and works very well.  They are about ten dollars.This PC is one I'd select if the price was low enough to give to my step-dad as a gift.  This is a guy who uses Google to search and Gmail to email.  He has discovered Ebay (much to my mother's chagrin...) and watches the occasional YouTube video.  Truly, a HP Chromebook 14-c050 (Sparkling Black) would do the trick for him, but he likes a bigger screen.Regarding price please note that during Black Friday this PC was less than two hundred, so paying more than three now would be silly.The HP 2000 series laptops are good machines, but look for one with a AMD 'A' processor with at least 3MB of L2 cache for the best performance.  The 1MB of L2 cache and the 'E' processor really make this PC very slow compared to others at this same price point.Video and sound are both OK, but nothing special.  Adding a Bluetooth speaker (with adapter - purchased separately) or headphones will help the sound.  The video is fine for online streaming and DVD watching, but not fast enough for serious gaming.Battery life is about 3.5 hours on a full charge, depending upon your usage.  If you're watching a DVD, the battery will drain faster than if you're emailing.This PC runs Windows 8, 64-bit.  I recommend you upgrade (for FREE) on the Microsoft website 'dowloads' to Windows 8.1 when you unpackage it - before adding other programs.  It adds a Start button that was part of Windows 7, but was missing from Windows 8, as well as a few other little things.  NOTE:  You get 60-Days FREE Norton Internet Security with this PC.This PC is nothing special, but as stated before, if the price is low enough, it'll be OK for the basics.These are the specs on this laptop, per the HP website:Microprocessor 1.3GHz AMD E-300 Accelerated ProcessorMicroprocessor Cache 1MB L2 CacheMemory 4GB DDR3 SDRAM (1 DIMM)Memory Max Maximum supported = 8GBMemory Slots 2 user accessibleVideo Graphics AMD Radeon HD 6310 Discrete-Class graphicsDisplay 15.6-inch diagonal HD BrightView LED-backlit display (1366x768)Hard Drive 320GB 5400RPM hard driveMultimedia Drive SuperMulti DVD burnerNetwork Card 10/100BASE-T Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 connector)Wireless Connectivity 1x1 802.11b/g/n WLANSound Altec Lansing dual speakersKeyboard: Full-size keyboardPointing Device Touchpad supporting multi-touch gestures with on/off buttonExternal Ports:  Multi-format digital media card reader for Secure Digital cards3 Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.01 HDMI1 VGA (15-pin)1 Headphone-out1 Microphone-inDimensions 1.20 in (min H)/ 1.41 in (max H) x 14.80 in (W) x 9.72 in (D)Weight 5.39 lbPower 65W AC adapter6-cell 47WHr 2.2 Ah lithium-ion batteryFront facing HP TrueVision HD Webcam with integrated dual array digital microphone", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hp 15.6 laptop 4GB just perfect for anybody!", "Author": "morella", "ReviewID": "R18LBRP93NX1SU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop is perfect for me, it' s very simple without complications and very easy to handle.
