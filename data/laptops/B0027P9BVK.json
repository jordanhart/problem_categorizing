Service sent me the recovery disks after being unable to fix it over the phone. Talked to India, but at least his english was good. A hassle but it got it working. Then it kept dropping my wireless connection to the point that wireless was useless- while my husbands laptop in the same room worked just fine (a cheap acer)- sony was no help- found the answer on a microsoft site, updated the software and fixed the problem. Another hassle, but it was fixed. Then the fan became loud sporadically, and then just this week, the hard drive died. Took it to my work I.T. guy and yes, he confirmed it is dead- just beeps and says unable to locate hard drive- recovery disks are no help when the brain is dead. Wow. And to think my husbands 350 dollar acer is chugging along- I will never EVER buy a sony again.", "Date": "March 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not what I expect from sony", "Author": "Anthony Martina", "ReviewID": "RPLDPP5WXGL8Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought a lot of these computers and most of them have problems with battery or wireless cards.

With this one VGN-CS320J/R. The first problem star with the Windows 7 upgrade and the DVD's only permit an upgrade and not a 0 installation, for this I have to install windows vista :s first and after the windows 7.So this series have a problem with a nosisy fan, and I not in USA right now and for tis they don't give me the waranty for this factory fail on the FAN.I will fix this noise (chang the fan for a new one) by my own, and sale it.

Chamberlain", "ReviewID": "R2H2QTGU454CI8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "No more Sony anything for me.My pink laptop started making loud noises and CPU utlization goes up to 40% and stays there for having one browser window with no plug-ins opened.Closing the lid does not put the computer to sleep as set.  Sony Backup thing keeps popping up when computer is turned on and no way to make it go away, even after clicking \"don't show again\".Media control button stopped working.Function buttons that adjusts the brightness, sound, screen position stopped working.Screen started flickering.I've only had this computer for 3 months. Love the pinkness and hate everything else.Spent hours talking to tech support on Dec 23 online and on the phone.  Was told to take computer into local service desk.  Found one at Beverly Center and spent Christmas Eve there. Technician told me I have to have the receipt with me (would be nice for them to tell me when I called to make the appointment). And that they have to ship in the computer and it would take at least 2 weeks for me to get it back because the Service Desk can't do anything at the store except help customers ship in the computer.Spent another 45 min on the phone with Service Center on the phone to schedule someone to come out instead.Was told technician would come out and fix it in 3 business days.  3 business days have come and gone... no calls.. so called in today to find out what's up.  Been on the phone for 2 hours now just to try to get the time the technician would come out.Asked them what part was shipped out to fix these problems and was told \"the fan\".  AMAZING FAN!!! A simple fan can fix all these issues!!!!Turns out that Sony outsource the service to a company called Nexicore and after 2 hours, Sony just told me here's the number to Nexicore... try calling them. Sweet deal.

There was a re-call on the fan a few years back but Sony was great about fixing it free of charge. A technician even came to my house. I didn't have to do anything but let Sony know I had a problem. Despite the fan issue I think the sony vaios are good quality consumer grade computers that will last years.", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "3.5 years and still going strong!", "Author": "Jack Goldstein", "ReviewID": "R207H4WKT94APY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I honestly don't know why everybody else on here is whining about the fan. All you needed to do was make ONE call to Sony, and they send out a tech to replace the fan for free. I bought this laptop in August 2009, and I got the fan replaced in May 2010. Took the tech about 10 mins. Its been golden ever since (not that it wasn't before, but the fan did make a pretty horrible noise).I upgraded to Windows 7 as soon as I could (I think I upgraded around October 2009), and that was possibly the best thing for this laptop. I had paid $750 for this thing, and its now on its 4th year. I can safely say that its been a quality product for me. Everything works exactly like it was in 2009. From the DVD drive, to the wifi, to the display, to the HD.This laptop is completely out of production, so writing a review for this doesn't make sense now. But I really wanted to because I want to dispel the s***ty reviews its been getting on here. Someone mentioned a con for this laptop being that \"it caught a virus and Sony was charging $180 to fix it\". I'm not sure if I facepalmed more at the \"it caught a virus\" part or that \"Sony was charging a $180 to fix it\". Seriously guy?I'm going to upgrade the HDD to an SSD, because I simply want to get more life out of it. A 5400rpm drive can no longer satiate my need for speed. Also, I upgraded to Windows 8 and dual boot with Ubuntu. I'm going to keep this bad boy around for years!", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Instead of just complaining about the fan - have it fixed for free!", "Author": "Grumpy 24/7", "ReviewID": "RLQJF3R7LGV1A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For all those above who complained about the fan noise, Sony did recognize the problem and even offered a free in home replacement of the fan!I bought my daughter this laptop for college, mostly because she really liked pink.  However a year later, while she was using it at the kitchen table doing homework, I noticed the fan had started getting extremely noisy and also the exhaust air was hotter than normal.  This meant the internals (motherboard, video chip, processor) weren't getting enough cooling, probably because the fan wasn't able to spin fast enough due to the bad bearing.  She had gotten used to it and didn't think to check if it was a problem.Unless the complainers above somehow managed to remove the VAIO Update tool (which runs in the tray in the lower right), then they should've received plenty of notice about the repair programs Sony offered.  While following the directions the Update tool provided to contact Sony and initiate the free in home repair of the fan, I happened to notice the display was also developing a small horizontal line across the middle.  According to the notices provided by the Update tool, this too was a covered repair so I arranged to have the screen looked at.The only downside to the repair process was Sony inexplicably scheduled two different technicians on two different days, one for the fan and the other for the screen.  When I realized they had done that I tried contacting Sony to consolidate the repairs to one tech and one visit, however Sony had scheduled the out-of-warranty repairs through two different support groups who couldn't coordinate their efforts.Despite the fact that sending two different techs probably cost Sony more than it should've for making the repairs, the fact was they were free to me and the techs even came to my home after hours so I didn't have to take any time off from work.  The repair process took less than an hour (each time) and now the fan works beautifully and the screen does too.Yes, it would've been nice if the VAIO hadn't needed these repairs in the first place, but the fact that Sony offered to perform the repairs for free (even after the normal warranty period had expired) shows to me they stand behind their products.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!", "Author": "Jule \"Snowbirdy6\"", "ReviewID": "R18BUAO09OBZFN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop with very few issues.

Overall, I feel quite comfortable in my purchase. Many others have reported an issue with the fan on this laptop. Although I have to agree that the fan does make some noises, I don't experience unreasonable volume of the fan or other operational issues. Since it is a laptop, and requires ventilation, I also use an external cooling pad while the laptop is on for several hours at a time and have never experienced over-heating or unwarranted shut downs. Anyone who uses a laptop for extended periods of time should look into purchasing one (they're relatively cheap, ranging about $10 to $30) and allow the laptop to breathe, especially when it's placed on soft surfaces like furniture, pillows, or your lap. Also, Sony has agreed to repair the fan relating to this model. Information for this can be found here: [...]. As with many technological devices, they all have their issues. I feel Sony products are very well made and they're support service programs are quite on top of any issues that arise. Additionally, they're customer service is very helpful as well.

As every other reviewer had pointed out, there was a problem with the fan (issue #1) noisy and defective. Also, (issue #2) the LCD started to blink in the bottom, first just a line, then a 1.5 cm wide band. We were lucky that it was another defective part in all the series, so Sony took the laptop for a month and a half and returned it with 2 new parts (LCD and cooler). Last, but not least, issue #3: the software is really annoying. A welcome manager gives a \"not working\" message, and the system says it's \"searching for solutions\" (never getting one), and Windows Vista is absolutely slow. The DualCore CPU means nothing.After we decided and reinstalled the whole system (with the factory restore utility) it remained slow and the welcome manager (now working) even when clicking on the \"don't open this automatically every time I turn my computer on\" option, keeps running during the start up!!?? and when you click on \"close\", it takes for ever to close down.Sony must have offered a free upgrade to Window 7 for this series, and include the Sony software and extra problems solutions in the upgrade, for sure.As long as the hardware is solid and not presenting new issues, formatting it and installing a Linux OS is the best deal for this laptop model.
