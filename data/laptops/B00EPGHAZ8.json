So I decided to upgrade. I considered the ASUS TX300CA-DH71, but it was too pricey, and I already have a high-end desktop replacement laptop. Then I saw this one. The specs looked good, and the price (at the time) was around what I was looking for. After using it for a while I like it.What I like:Full HD, no more of the ancient 1366 x 768 resolution.An i5 processor, significantly more horsepower than an Atom. I can to more than merely browsing and Office, even moderate gaming and photo editiing on it.Decent screen size, almost a bit too large, but I'm getting used to it.The flexibility to use it as a notebook or a tablet, the computer is actually in the display/tablet section.Separate dc plug AND USB 3.0 port, while just one, but it's nice to be able to keep power to the unit and use the USB, with my Vivotab it was one or the other.The microSD slot.What kept me from giving a full 5 star:Available memore much lower than I expected; my Vivotab had 64GB, with around 30GB available, so I was expecting to see at least 80GB available on this unit when I first powered it on, instead, it had only around 62GB. That seems a bit much bloatware from Asus, I'm looking into what I can get rid of to free space.Battery life doesn't seem to last what Asus claims, while this is an i5, and I do more intense tasks, given the size of the tablet I could eke out 5 hours, still, I expected longer.It's a bit weighty but that comes with the size and specs.Something I seem to notice common with Asus devices, from my Nexus 7, my Vivotab, and this unit, they seem to have a mind of their own when they will charge when plugged in. Often I will see \"plugged in, not charging\", even when the unit is like down to 10% battery. As I travel a lot and often away from outlets, this gets annoying.All in all, very satisfied and happy customer.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Much heavier than expected", "Author": "C. Nicholas", "ReviewID": "R23VFFV756QX0N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the feature that allows the screen to detach from the keyboard, however, the screen is too heavy to be used as a tablet.  The glossy screen holds fingerprints and smears excessively.  I have had a lot of trouble with the keyboard suddenly failing for no apparent reason. It drove me nuts until I figured out that shutting off the screen momentarily and restarting it will reconnect the keypad without actually losing your work i.e. shutting down fully.It also is difficult to pry the laptop open.  I have arthritis and it hurts my fingers.  Also, lifting it is painful to my wrists.On the plus side, the screen size is such a pleasure compared to my 10 inch asus netbook.  And this computer is very quick and responsive.  Start up is nearly instantaneous.  I think ASUS brand is excellent but this transformer model is too cumbersome.I wish the keypad letters were clearer--they are really kind of gray on black and impossible to see in low light.  My little ASUS netbook had white keys with black letters and was much easier visually.I'll keep this transformer for in home use-- it really will be too heavy for transport.  It is nice and thin but everytime I pick it up its heaviness surprises me.If you are young and strong and still have good youthful vision, my assessment may be quite irrelevant.  But alas, I am old and dim of sight.....", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Option", "Author": "J. R. O. Neal \"Islidur\"", "ReviewID": "R29YJE303MFQED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Asus TX300 for some time and really enjoy most everything about it. It recently came time to upgrade the wife's HP Elitepad (the Z2760 processor just has no power) and she had commented about liking the 13\" size of mine. I thought of buying her the TX300, but it's biggest drawback wouldn't work with her computing style, that being the battery life. So I went on the hunt for a 13\" Windows based tablet/convertable with at least an I5 processor. There are a few options out there from Asus, HP and Sony, but after doing in depth research on all of them, the T300 came out on top.Some things that swayed me were,The Asus has a U processor instead of the lower power Y. However, units with the Y are selling for the same or more.The Asus has a much better screen than the competition in this price range.In tablet mode, the Asus is thinner than it's competition.Previous experience with Asus quality.When the unit arrived, I was a little disappointed that it wasn't already upgraded to Windows 8.1. I spent about 4 hours upgrading and updating Windows, then transfered all of her material from the HP before I could get into testing the unit. The build quality is good and the unit feels very solid, though I'm not a fan of the plastic sides between the aluminum back and glass front. The keyboard is solid and in all my tests, never lost connection with the tablet. The keyboard does have a switch for power, but it will go to sleep if not used for a few minutes. Upon waking, it reconnects immediately. I'm also not a fan of the charging method for the keyboard. At this point, you must use the tablet to charge it utilizing the USB cable connector. If Asus had put the same kind of power connector on the keyboard as the tablet, you could charge it seperately.The TX300 has a third gen I7 processor while the T300 has a fourth gen I5. There's not a lot of difference in performance between the two. This unit completes most tasks just barely behind my TX300 and does it using less power, so the battery lasts almost twice as long. It also finishes some things first because of it's faster SSD.Side by side comparisons of the screen quality shows improvement as well. It's crisper and clearer with brighter whites than the TX300. You will want to turn off the auto brightness to see it at it's fullest.I do like the USB on the tablet, but would also like at least one on the keyboard. A backlit keyboard would be nice too.Overall, I'm please with the purchase and the wife couldn't be happier. I knew when I bought her the HP that it would need to be upgraded in a year, and was. This unit should last her at least twice that long.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Failed", "Author": "Rowdy Stowell", "ReviewID": "RCKSYZCH4NGIH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sorry to say It failed in 1 week and ASUS said it would fix it in 5-7 days.

As you can tell, I am ambivalent about this convertible laptop.  First let me tell you the good news about this.1.  The Computer/Tablet portion of this is great.2.  This thing boots up faster than anything else I have ever owned.  The main reason I got a new computer was that my old laptop took minutes to boot up.  This despite getting a faster hard drive, more memory, etc.  It sped up a bit when I re-installed the operating system but not enough.  The ASUS boots up literally in seconds.  A big plus for the computer.3.  The battery life is just as good as advertised.  I can go all day with this without having it be plugged in.4.  The screen resolution is fantastic.  Everything is crystal clear.5.  The touch screen works fairly well, at least well enough for me.  My wife's iPad works more slickly but then again I don't like the restrictions of using Apple products.  They do what they do well but some things they don't do or allow you to do at all, but this is not an Apple review.  At any rate, I'm not sure if any deficiencies in touch screen functionality are attributable to the Operating system (Windows 8.1) or the device.  I lean towards the operating system.  On the other hand, I like Windows 8.1 more than I thought I would so this is a bit of a wash.6.  The sound is good to excellent for the size of the device.  It's better than my wife's iPad.Now for the bad.  Most of the problems were with the keyboard but some things can be related to the computer itself.  Right up front, before I enumerate the many, many defects, I'll tell you this is flat out the worst keyboard I've every used.1.  The first item relates to the keyboard but is actually about the computer.  There is only one USB port.  I have no idea what ASUS was thinking here.  This is simply not enough.  The touch pad on the keyboard is worthless, which I'll get into later, so I use a wireless mouse.  That requires a transmitter plugged into the USB port.  I know I could buy a blue tooth mouse but why should I throw away a perfectly good mouse.  I use USB drives extensively and if you plug in a USB drive you can't use the wireless mouse.  Worse, the keyboard charges via the USB port so I've got three things I want to use and I can't use them all at once.  It is extremely frustrating.2.  I mentioned the touch pad and I'll examine that more extensively here.  First of all, just navigating the mouse is difficult to do.  Often the mouse simply seems to disappear from the screen and then reappear somewhere else.  Next, you are supposed to be able to click or double click by tapping on a mouse pad.  This sometimes works and sometimes simply does not.  It doesn't seem to matter whether you tap lightly or tap hard, it simply will not work when it does not want to, which is often.  You get so frustrated with this you eventually want to put your finger through the touch pad, thus I stopped using it and started to use the external mouse.  Oh, and originally I thought I could get around this by learning to just use clicking on the lower left button but once again this sometimes works and sometimes does not.3.  If you don't type for a while and then go to type again it will not type right away.  I know with other keyboards I have used that usually the computer just has to catch up with things and eventually will enter on the screen what you typed on the keyboard.  Not with this keyboard.  It either simply does nothing, or even worse it will type multiples of the last thing you typed.4.  The keys do not have a good feel.  In fact the whole keyboard feels thin and cheap.  You feel like, if you typed hard enough you would go through the keyboard.5.  Occasionally the keyboard will disconnect from the computer.  I've tried everything.  I thought there would be an easy way to relink it but there is not.  What I've had to do is to reboot the computer and then the keyboard starts functioning again.  Not ideal.6.  The guts of the computer are in the screen, which is to be expected if you want to use something as a disconnected tablet.  The downside is that, if you use this on your lap as I do, it tips over very easily.  I've caught it in time thus far but it just seems a matter of time before I miss catching it.7.  My wife has a blue tooth keyboard for her iPad and it literally goes days between charges.  Not so with this keyboard.  Battery life is much shorter than the batter life of the computer, which can be very frustrating.8.  Once again, this charges through a USB port.  One thing I learned fairly quickly is that it does not seem to charge when the laptop is closed.  I'm not sure why but there were several occasions where I got somewhere, after thinking I'd charged it the night before, and the keyboard did not work and was not charged.  I have since resolved this problem by getting a long USB cord and plugging it into a converter and then into a socket so I don't use the laptop USB port.  This isn't ideal but it works.  BTW, if the battery runs all the way down I thought I could plug it in and get it to work but apparently this is not the case.  You have to wait until it charges up.9.  Of course it's difficult to tell how charged the keyboard is because there is only a light which is either white or yellow.  How much is left when the light is yellow is only your guess.10.  With all the problems with the Bluetooth keyboard I would occasionally use the software provided on-screen keyboard.  I'm not impressed by this also, although it works.  The keyboard does not automatically pop up the way it did on my Android and does on my wife's iPad, when you turn the Bluetooth keyboard off.  Also, nothing adjusts when the keyboard comes up which can create the problem that you can't see what you're typing in because the keyboard is covering what you're typing into.  You can get around this but you shouldn't have to.OK, so why did I buy this device?  Basically I had two devices.  I had a regular laptop that was getting old and slow to boot.  I also had an Android device.  The Android device was fine for doing very rudimentary things but was incapable of doing other things.  Also, I have several very intense spreadsheets I've done using Excel.  I would bring these spreadsheets into the Android device and any and all spreadsheets I tried, and I tried most of them, would either not work at all or worse, would make changes that would render the spreadsheet unusable in Excel, so I'd have to re-do them.  The bottom line is that Android is a wild west situation with applications.  There does not appear to be much in the way of quality control.  So I wanted a Windows device that could do everything I was doing with the two devices I had.  This looked like the way to go.  It wasn't, at least not as a complete solution.My recommendation, if you do or have to do a lot of typing, ie. use it primarily as a laptop, don't get this device.  It will leave you entirely frustrated.  If you want this primarily as a tablet you may be able to get around the deficiencies but you will still be frustrated from time to time.I am very disappointed in ASUS.  Why would you create such a great computer and pair it with the worlds worst keyboard?  It makes no sense.  After this experience I probably would not buy another ASUS and that's what happens when a manufacturer does something like this.  In fact I was going to give this a 2 star rating but because the tablet portion is as good as I described it I decided it warranted 3 stars.  Too bad.  This could have been something to rave about.  Instead it's something to rant about.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great idea, but still lots of room for improvement.", "Author": "Arthur", "ReviewID": "R3ONO0XJBBCQMJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the size of it for a laptop, although it is a little too big to use as a tablet unless you put it in a stand.I don't mind the weight too much, the size is a bigger issue than the weight for using it as a tablet.The screen looks brilliant and sharp, but it is very glossy so there will be quite a bit of glare if you use it in sunlight. The screen also doesn't seem to get very bright.The keyboard dock really grinds my gears (see below) and sometimes freezes, where you have to restart the computer to get it to resume working.Here is what I think can be improved1. The keyboard docka. The most annoying attribute is the track pad sounds way to loud.b. The keyboard dock should have a connector to charge while the tablet is docked to the keyboardc. The keyboard could use lighting in some shape or form (backlighting is nice but even a book light would suffice), it is hard to use in a dark enviroment. Combined with the glossy screen, you can only use the keyboard optimally with average lightingd. There seems to be some weights in keyboard. It would be better if these weights were taken out and the keyboard was balanced with more battery or storage.e. The dock could use some more connectivity, perhaps a USB 2.0 or two (if this is possible over bluetooth, just something I can plug a mouse into)f. The tablet can only be angled to a certain point, making it awkward to use on your lap. In addition, it can fall over easily. It may have been a good idea to put in a small kickstand or stabilizer that you can put in or out.2. Another USB on the tablet would be nice, since there is sometimes the one USB connection is occupied by the keyboard to charge it. I would rather have miniHDMI instead of microHDMI, but that is just me.3. Ability to upgrade the RAM or SSD - AFAIK these are soldered on the motherboard and are not able to be upgraded4. One of the ASUS programs preinstalled is not compatible with this machine, could use less bloatware, but it isn't as bad as other.Overall, I think that this tablet is a step in the right direction, but there are many improvements that would make this better laptop. As a tablet, it is a little on the big size, making it awkward to use.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Tien from Dragon Ball Z", "ReviewID": "RCXLL104HT5ED", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Almost exactly what I wanted.Weight/Size:The ASUS website is misleading. This product is advertised to weigh 1.4lb for the tablet itself and 1.4lb for the dock, so totaling at 2.8lbs. The tablet-laptop definitely weighs more than advertised. It feels about 4lbs or a little lighter than that but it weighs much less than my old laptop so I can live with this. The 13.3\" 1080p display is a beauty to look at but for tablet use, it is ridiculously big, especially in portrait mode.Touch:I think it needs an increase of sensitivity. It doesn't register my touch at times. I find it easier to use the touch pad because it's easier to click on small links. Touch is fine for large icons though.Keyboard:It has a brushed metal look with a light purple tinged to it. The keys are responsive and but feels a touch cheap. I do enjoy typing on this keyboard. Since the tablet-laptop is top heavy when docked the keyboard doesn't lay completely flat in certain angles with the screen. I would be able to press down on the left corner of the keyboard on the opposing side from the dock so there's slight warping due to the weight of the tablet I assume.Hinge/Dock:The hinge limits how far the screen is pushed back but so far the angles have worked for me. The locking mechanism feels kind of cheap and not sturdy. Its a single button with a plastic latch that holds the tablet to the hinge. It worried me at first because of the screen's weight but its holds up well.Battery life:PERFECTION. I thought 8hrs was so short compared to the ASUS t100's 11hr battery life but my tablet-laptop lasted more than the 8hrs, granted I was not doing any heavy duty tasks but it performed exceptionally well. The charging cable is a block with a thin cord. It doesn't add much to the weight IMOWindows 8:I immediately installed updates and upgraded to Windows 8.1 after unboxing my ASUS. This took about 3-4 hours. I thought it performed a touch smoother with the update. However there was a slight glitch. When my tablet went to sleep (when I close the laptop without powering down) and opened it, it led me to recovery settings. I clicked an save and exit button which only allowed it to turn off and return to the same screen. I had to force shut down (holding down power) to turn off and turn it back on to return to my normal screen. I changed my settings to not allow sleep when I close the laptop and now it wakes up normally if i manually hit sleep.Microsoft Office:If only it came with it...activated. It comes pre-installed but an product key is needed to activate it.Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase.

Here is why...The first unit arrived on May 5, 2014.  I turned the unit on with great anticipation and as the dark screen with the nice ASUS transformer logo was being displayed I immediately noticed a bright spot which was a \"dead\" pixel near the top of the screen, just to the right of center.  Very frustrating.  My eyes were constantly drawn to this spot.  Needless to say, it was returned and a replacement was ordered.The second unit arrived on May 8, 2014 and the screen was flawless.  I spent hours creating a restore backup to USB flash drive, applying Windows updates and then upgrading to Windows 8.1.  I was really enjoying this laptop until I tried to use the Camera app to take a picture.As soon as the Windows 8.1 camera app appeared, a message was displayed saying, please connect a camera.  I was shocked.  There I was staring at the built in camera lens on the front.  I then turned it around just to make sure the specs were correct and sure enough there was a camera lens on the back.  What happened?  Why was the camera not working?I immediately looked in the device manager and could not find any drivers loaded for the HD camera.  I searched ASUS web site and there were no drivers listed for it either.  So, I called ASUS tech support and of course, they said that I had to do a factory restore to make sure that I didn't mess anything up. So, I got a case number, hung up and went about doing a factory restore.  Good thing I made a backup first.45 minutes later, the factory restore was complete and I was back to Windows 8.  I started up the camera app, and low and behold, there was that message again, \"Please connect a camera\".  More time wasted.I called ASUS tech support back, gave them my case # and told them what I did and what was going on.  They had me check the BIOS to look for a setting to enable the camera.  Nothing there.  Check the device manager and nothing was there.  They told me that I would have to ship them the unit and they would either repair it or send me a refurbished unit.  I was stunned.I decided that it was not fair that I should have to send in a brand new device and after shelling out about $750.00 just to possibly end up with a refurbished unit, so the second unit is going back as well.The MS Store is now out of stock on these devices, so no more $699.00 deal. I have now ordered one on Amazon even though it is costing me about $120 more.  I probably should have ordered from Amazon in the first place, but I was just trying to save a few bucks.Anyway, I am now anxiously awaiting the delivery and keeping my fingers crossed that this 3rd unit is a charm and will be flawless.UPDATE: I received the 3rd unit today (05/15/2014).  I purchased this on Amazon.com from National Sale LLC.  I opened the box and powered it up.  No dead pixels and the front and back cameras are working.  So far, everything seems to be fine with this one.One thing that got me a little miffed was when I reviewed the system properties, it was branded as a Microsoft Signature device, just like the 1st two units that I purchased directly from the MS Store.  I guess it was just my luck to get 2 lemons from Microsoft and this \"reseller\" was able to get a good one to resell to me.

This option didn't immediately appear for me until after a reboot. But, when you run it, expect anywhere from 2-4 hours ( depending on your download speed ).  It may even appear stuck, but just let it run.The bluetooth keyboard does NOT need to be docked as others have stated.  It will also sleep on you to conserve power if not used for a period of time.  I did experience one or two times where the bluetooth connection just dropped and I was stuck in touch screen mode until reboot. But this was rare.  Also, the device when docked only opens to roughly 120 degrees as it's center of balance would be off if it were to open any farther.  The 120 degree limitation is sufficient while at a desk, but doesn't 'feel' right if placed on your lap.  Personally, I've just gotten used to leaving the keyboard on my desk and undock for everywhere else.HDD wise, you get roughly 98 Gb as the hidden recovery partition utilizes the remainder.  I recommend either sticking with a cloud based storage solution, or investing in a 64 Gb SD card if you commonly are outside of wifi zones.  For strictly home use, I suggest saving to a shared drive on another pc and don't bother with the SD card.  Save your hdd space for programs/apps rather than filling it with photos.Speaking of photos, two cameras are installed.  Surprisingly, the camera facing away from the display does NOT have an activity light to notify anyone that it is active as opposed to the camera that faces the display.  Both cameras are fairly descent for video chat, etc.My four star rating was given purely over the audio.  Sound emits only out one side of the device which basically negates stereo sound.  The device is also advertised to have a built in mic, but no mic is noted in the manual.  Utilizing Skype, it sounded like i was speaking under water and muffled.  If you want decent sound and/or mic, you'll need to purchase a headset.Speed wise, this device is quite fast. Boot up time and wake up time are impressive as well as reboot and shutdown.  So far, I haven't run across any software that runs slow on this device.Last note, if you register your device with Asus, as it will ask you to at some point, you will be emailed a code which gives you $25.00 credit to use at the MS Store.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "An affordable and great 2-in-1!", "Author": "Dave Mai", "ReviewID": "R2V3V41WQUWXDM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this laptop for 17 days now as my daily computer. I'm a high schooler and I use my laptop during school and mostly at home for homework and entertainment.What I LIKE about this laptop:-The battery is really good. It can last a full day of web surfing, word documenting, watching movies, multitasking (snap 2 apps side-by-side) with moderate use. Power saving was on the whole time, though. So I guess with intense use, it would last about 4 to 5 hours.-The keyboard dock has an excellent keyboard and space to put both of your palms on and a hefty battery that could last a whole week in a single charge. Simple, the keyboard is just perfect for me, as a writer, too.-The Full HD screen is just gorgeous. Period. Oh, the touch sensitivity is also great.-Boot up time and shutdown time are blazing fast. I haven't noticed the shutdown time but boot up time is about 5 SECONDS! So love it.-Blazing computing speed. Switching apps is fluid and multitasking is flawless.-It has a microSD card so an extra 62 GB of storage. Nice.-The width is thin, making it easy to travel with. My shoulders are grateful of it. :D-Little bloatwares but also a useful bunch. Most of the 3rd party software that Asus preinstalled I found really useful. NOTE: don't uninstall the ATK package because it controls the connection between your computer and the dock!-2 cameras, one in the back and a webcam. I enjoy of having both.Now what I WOULD LIKE ASUS TO CONSIDER IMPROVING:-The weight of the screen is making the whole computer tilt backward when putted on the lap or uneven surface. Sometimes.-(This is what I'm really annoyed) The screen angle when docked to the keyboard is excruciating tight.-The touchpad is not that sensitive as you might have hoped and it gets pretty loud when clicked.-The weight of the screen is too heavy to be handled by one hand, or even two. I found it noticeably and painfully heavy when holding it up to play some games or surfing the web.-The computer heats up really fast when playing some game apps, and it gets considerably hot.-The usable storage is actually only 98 GB. So I recommend you purchase an extra 62 GB micro SD for a few dozen bucks for portability or just a full-fledge external hard drive if you are a hardcore user.-There is only one USB 3.0 port.-The speaker is decent but still enjoyable. Only needs to be louder if possible.-The RAM is always at 50% and above. I don't know what is being processed in the background but I would rather nottamper anything because it might mess my computer up in the process. Though, I found it plenty to use for the usable 2 GB of memory.-The volume rocker is really hard to push. You really need to give it a hard push.In conclusion, consider the price tag of this computer is a lot cheaper than all of the other convertibles, the Asus Transformer Book T300, with its good spec, is a must-have computer if you need a long-lasting battery, extreme multitasking with casual software, an excellent keyboard, a gorgeous FULL HD display and a tablet and a laptop in one with a price tag under $1000, this is the one for you.", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Top flight hardware", "Author": "David Robertus", "ReviewID": "RSWV3IHX6NVQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recall when Asus was a second tier brand.

About the weight, as the tablet includes everything (main battery, motherboard,...) but the keyboard, it is much heavier than the keyboard and it can fall over easily on the tablet side. A 12-inch size might have been a better option.This said, the hardware is powerful, making the machine reactive. The screen resolution is nice as well.

Now, I love it.  This is a very unique product that will not appeal to everyone and it takes a little tweaking to get it just the way you want it.  You must think whether you want it 75% as an amazing and BIG tablet that'll still run Office (and behave like a normal laptop) when you need it or 75% as a laptop (great specs for the price) that you can use as a tablet once in a while.  If it's the former (75% tablet) go buy this NOW!  If it's the latter, this product may drive you nuts.  Here's why:Pro's1.  Amazing, sharp 1080i screen.  Netflix looks amazing on it.2.  Good keyboard, and MUCH better than other \"docking-type\" keyboards.3.  Very fast system that runs Windows 8.1 and Office 365 beautifully.4.  \u00bd the price of a comparably specced Mac (the retina displays start at $1,349).  Non-retina displays are not 1080i.5.  I love to read stuff on the tablet (e.g. the morning NYtimes) by turning it so the long part is top-to-bottom.  Love it!Cons's1. Weight distribution.  B/c all the hardware is in the screen/tablet part, the weight distribution is a mess.  The ASUS engineers obviously had to restrict the back-swing of the screen to keep it from flopping over.  As a result, if you're 6'4\" like me, I've got to scrunch way down to look directly at the screen, while my 5' wife sits perfectly in front of the screen.  For 20 or 30 minutes, this is not an issue; beyond 30 minutes and it definitely becomes an issue.  Also, you can't really rest the laptop on anything when it's docked to the keyboard except a flat surface like a desk or a countertop b/c it's too unsteady and will flop back if you're not careful.My solution:  I bought a cheap tablet stand ($12) from Amazon and it works GREAT.  I can still use the keyboard (it does not have to be attached) and set the angle exactly the way I want.  For me, this solution fixes the problem 99%.  I looked at bluetooth keyboards at Fry's but none of them were even half as good as the dock/keyboard that comes with this device.2.  The screen is SOOOO beautifully glossy.  You take it to a coffee shop and the glare makes it practically unusable.My solution:  Stick a screen protector on it (I got the Ginovo on amazon for $6 - see my review) and the screen is perfect!  No glare at all and no risk of scratches.  So far, it doesn't seem to affect the touch aspect of the touchscreen at all. For me, problem is 100% fixed.3.  There may be something I'm overlooking but the sound is SOOO loud.  Even on the lowest setting (2 out of a 100) it blows my neighbor away.  There must me a way to recalibrate this but I haven't figured it out.My recommendation:  if you plan to use this device as a plain laptop more than 75% of the time, I would NOT get it.  The weight distribution issue will drive you nuts (unless you're under 5' xx\".  If you are planning on using the screen as a tablet more than 75% of the time (and you're OK with, or prepared to adapt to, the tiger-than-normal screen angle issue, I would DEFINITELY get this.  For me, it's fantastic.  If you're in the middle-range, it's a tough call:  if they were the same price, I'd get the retina display (1080i) Macbook Air in a heart beat or at least check-out the Zenbook.
