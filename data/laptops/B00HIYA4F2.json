{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A good \"cheap\" laptop.", "Author": "M. Stevens", "ReviewID": "RQ0Y6FF1UYZTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm going to write an honest review. First of all laptops and computers cost a lot these days. Mostly it's because most of them have a touch screen which makes the price go up. I've bought many laptops and computers in my life. I've even have a custom built desktop that I use for playing video games and streaming. With that in mind I didn't need a \"fancy\" laptop. I needed something that I could use for \"work\" which includes writing, editing videos, designing graphics, etc. and this laptop works for me.What this computer has:-1 TB (terabyte) hard drive-Windows 8.1-DVD/CD writer/player-3 USB Ports (1 for 2.0, 2 for 3.0)-6 GB Ram (5.2 useable)-2.5 GHZ processor (Yes the official listing on Amazon says 3.5 but I'm looking at my computer specs right now and it says 2.5)-15.6 inches screen (I used to have a 17.3 inch laptop and honestly after using this laptop for a little bit now the size difference doesn't bother me anymore)-5.3 pounds (Lightest laptop I've ever owned)-lithium ion battery (standard battery most laptops have)Cons:-This laptop at times feels \"cheap\" and if you pick it up by the back it sometimes sounds like you are breaking the DVD drive so be careful on how you pick it up.-The keyboard feels a little on the cheap side as well.-Comes with a lot of things you NEED to uninstall right away. (for an example get rid of internet explorer and the Skype app. Actually I uninstalled most of the apps on the laptop and only use the \"desktop\". It's like using Windows 7 for the most part.Pros:-You can basically ignore the app screen and download the full programs instead of using the apps.-There's actually a \"start\" button. On here's it's a image of a house but it acts just like the start button you see on Windows 7.-Energy Star! Means saving energy means saving money! :D-BIOS button on keyboard. This could be a con too if a child is using this laptop and hits that button though.-Easiest Windows 8 computer I've used. This is my third Windows 8 laptop I've used and for some reason this one is the easiest and actually doesn't make me want to throw it out of the window.-DVD and CD drive! You'd be surprised how many laptops these days DON'T come with this! I'm so happy this one does because I play many DVD/CD based video games and also enjoy watching DVDs.-Can play League of Legends! Now I stated before I do have a gaming computer as well so I didn't buy this to play video games but it's nice to know it could run it if I wanted to play it on it.-Can lift with one hand. I used to have really toned arms back in high school, I think it's because my laptop back then was 20 pounds. It's nice having a laptop that doesn't make my legs fall asleep anymore since it's super light.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelent Laptop for its price", "Author": "U. Tui \"JC\"", "ReviewID": "RH6Y64GVIEYQS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new laptop, due I needed something better that my small,old but good toshiba satellite (AMD A6,15\"), but I didn't want to spend more than $600 ,due to it wasn't enough for highschool work combined with gaming. I use all microsoft office, combined with skydrive, dropbox, gdrive, and some extra programs I've collected, I use to play all Age of Empires, the screen is wonderful and with windows 8.1 multitasking, it is great!This laptop is beautiful, it runs fast with this AMD A10, the sound is really good, the screen has a very competitive resolution, 1tb is enough for me too 6 gb in RAM are good the HD camera is a plus for me, and although I was accustomed to work with windows 7, windows 8 is very helpful, I ve had this laptop for two days, and i haven't had any trouble with it.", "Date": "March 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic deal! Good enough graphics, great low price!", "Author": "Daniel Steren", "ReviewID": "R2PZ0QFDAISGK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ownership: Less than a monthReason for Buying: I wanted a basic computer to get me through college but also let me play the occasional game or two. I didn't get a cheaper computer because that's the route I went 2 years ago and it couldn't handle graphics worth beans. I'm in college so I didn't want to shell out a ton of money either so this was the perfect fit for my budget and needs.Pros:It works great. For what this thing does it is a stellar price! Graphics card is good. I can play Skyrim on high quality. I just got Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (hey it was only $2.50) and noticed the intro videos were a little jumpy. Gameplay is pretty good, though I may have to turn down the settings just a little. Graphics was my only concern after looking at the specs so I'm happy to say it works just fine. I'm just a casual gamer though so I don't care about maxing out detail, fps, etc. Of course it does the rest of my computing needs just fine. Mostly word processing, a little bit of coding in visual studio. Speakers are great compared to my last laptop. Has usb 3.0. Don't use it now really but future compatibility. Has bluetooth built in.Cons:Windows 8 of course. I'm getting used to it now but there are still some programs that aren't compatible with it. There are good sides to windows 8 but I can't even get 64 bit java. Anyways, moving on. This is super picky of me but the front edge is a little sharp. If my desk is to high and I'm resting my wrists on the front edge it will dig into my arms. Oh, and BLOATWARE out the wazoo! Thanks Lenovo. :P  I end up touching the track-pad a lot while I'm typing. This isn't a big deal for me since I usually use a mouse anyways, and there is a disable track-pad button, but keep it in mind. The CPU rating in the windows experience index but I haven't ever really found it a problemSo...I would recommend it to anyone. I don't see the point of shelling out $1000+ for computers when they change so fast as it is. The graphics are good enough to get you through your basic games. It does everything else like a champ. And the price was fantastic. I picked it up when it was at it's lowest price point so I was super stoked. Of course I can't tell you about it's longevity since I've only had it a few weeks but I expect I'm hoping to get 3-4 years out of this puppy. It really is a great deal!UPDATE: Some previous reviews I read mentioned an update to the BIOS was necessary. I didn't notice any problems but figured I should probably do it anyways. However, when I followed the steps I found out that I am running the current BIOS version. So this laptop is now shipping with the an up-to-date BIOS, meaning won't have to worry about updating it.I also noticed that my bluetooth wasn't working at the start. I had to manually install the driver in order for it to work. The file is located on the D: drive partition. @ D:\\drivers\\Bluetooth\\Atheros\\8.0.1.306\\setup.exe. Just run the file and your bluetooth will start working. :)", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent for the price", "Author": "mark", "ReviewID": "R1BHW9L6FKCR08", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had the computer for a little over a month and so far am happy with my purchase. I also purchased the computer when it was about $450I do, however, have a few complaints:1. The battery life is pretty poor compared to what was advertised. It is most certainly not 5 hours not matter what power settings you choose..2. The speakers aren't very loud and seem to fade in and out of a muffled state at will.3. The touchpad(mouse-pad) is located such that the palm under the thumb will hit it while typing. It's just a design flaw on the lower portion of the keyboard.There are ways to make Windows 8 function more like Classic windows(7/vista/XP) so that was never an issue. It boots up fast and I have noticed no issues in running multiple programs at once.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Laptop for Its Price", "Author": "Bob Jones", "ReviewID": "R1HCPU0PKJLFEZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking and looking for a laptop after my old Dell Inspiron 1318 broke down, I asked on some forums for a decent laptop to play Minecraft on and do school work, along with some video editing (not hardcore video editing). The first person considered this laptop on Newegg (even though I ordered it from Amazon lol). It was $500, and looked pretty nice. After asking some people about it, I decided to buy it.Two days later I got the laptop in the mail, and I really loved it! Setting up my account took a while, and I had a bunch of nonsense installed on it (I never uninstalled them just in case I need them, which I probably won't, but it doesn't hurt, does it? ;) ), but otherwise it ran quite smoothly. It's also extremely quiet, which is a huge issue I had with my old Dell. It was so darned loud, and now I'm actually glad it broke XD On the contrary, I'm typing from this laptop and I can't hear anything from it except for the sound of the keys as I press each key. Speaking of the keyboard, I both like it and don't like it. The number pad on the side is a great add-on to the keyboard. It helps me quite a bit. However, the right shift button is quite small. It doesn't matter though, as I usually use the left shift button :P The thing that I hate the most about this keyboard is the space bar button, it doesn't even register sometimes. I've had to go back and add a space at least 10 times while writing this review. This still isn't enough to take away a star though.I tried playing Minecraft on low settings (with the exception of extreme render distance and fancy graphics) with Optifine. It runs at about 40-60ish fps, which is pretty good for me. However, that doesn't mean that it can handle other games as well. Graphically intense games probably won't be too great, Battlefield 4 is only playable on low settings, according to a review on Newegg. Dolphin emulator, however, runs very smoothly. I have games with frame limit disabled play from 50%-250% speed!The 3 USB ports help a lot, I use the USB 2.0 port for my mouse and the other 2 for various things. It took me about 5 minutes for me to move 11 GB worth of files from my desktop to my external hard drive, and about 2 minutes to transfer them from my EHD to my laptop, so the USB 3.0 really does help transferring files.Oh, how could I miss the CPU? The AMD A10-5750M is pretty good, and having 4 cores really helps. I also expanded the RAM to 8GB (7.20 GB usable), and i can run a lot of tabs on Google Chrome, Skype, and record my videos all without it lagging. I can even play Minecraft and use Synthesia without lag!Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to casual gamers and people who want to do usual things. Graphically intense games probably won't do very well on it, but it's great for just school documents, light gaming, and even video editing! (though the render times will likely be slow) This laptop is definitely something I would recommend to my friends and others.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Daniel S.

Then I came across this g505s from Lenovo.  It had most of the feature I wanted.  Most importantly it was under $600.  When I got, I was so excited to give my new toy a try.  The movies played beautifully.  I had it hooked up to my 52 in sharp tv via hdmi.  The Sound and image was fantastic.  Next, I tried surfing the web.  It was fast, but using windows 8 is something new to me.  The web address bar on win 8 is on the bottom vs the top like on my vista explore.  I am just getting use to it now.Now, the real fun is the pc games.  The laptop is a little slow on loading the game, but the graphics was pretty smooth as long as the setting was not set high.  Overall, I'm happy with its performance.  I gave it a five star.  I could have purchased a decent pc desktop below $400.  However, I wanted to be able to take my pc to other places.  That's why I chose to go with a laptop.Cons...  I do notice that the laptop assert a lot of heat.  The keyboard feels a little awkward with its keys spread out a bit.  Although it is advertised as being thin, I still find it a bit heavy.  I'm still happy with it.  It's under $600!", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "True Review", "Author": "Jeffrey Detring", "ReviewID": "R3BCU5FEVZYCGR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This laptop is good for basic end users. If you are looking for going online, watching netflix/dvd's etc this laptop is perfect for you. Probably even a great laptop if you're looking at it for school.The laptop does not however handle gaming the best.I can and have played League of Legends and Diablo 3 on this laptop. It's great. Major down side is that it seems to have a problem with getting really hot despite the HUGE venting it has. The vents are on the left side and as such, when you touch the left side you expect it be warm. When I am playing a game on the laptop it's extremely hot to the touch, almost to the point it burns my fingers. The hot area isn't just at the vent, it's also on top of the keyboard, all along the left 1/4th of the laptop.My first one died within 30 days and wouldn't even boot. That one never even got hot. The second one that Amazon sent me at n/c to me and in an extremely fast turn around time (48 hours) is the one I currently have that seems to have an issue with heating. My concern is the laptop, not the way Amazon handled my issue. The representative was very kind, understanding and did a great job at keeping basic conversations with no down time while on the call, something I struggle with constantly as a customer service representative.I would say if you order anything on amazon.com to make sure it's sold BY Amazon.

Grandma likes the large screen, mom likes the extra space for photos and recipes, kids like the webcam and app feel and dad likes the price!

FAST! And runs whisper quit. But it is a 2.5Ghz, not 3.5Ghz as listed, but I knew that already.Sound is very good too.Did software updates, Updated the Bios, and uninstalled that useless MacAfee junk and the built in Windows Defender started up, did the updates for that...The only gripe I have is I can not feel the touch pad keys or see it very well do to I have very little feeling in my fingers. I fixed that with some aluminum tape on the keys to highlight them. The other thing is Amazon did not package it well at all. I'm surprised it was not damaged thanks to Lenovo that did well with the foam packing. Amazon put it in a large 2'x2'x1' box (that's approximate foot measurements) with a metal object that I should had ordered separately. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000COU2DE/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc;=1It had the useless bags of air and not enough of it so everything bounced around with the metal object partly stuck into the Lenovo box. The Amazon box was partly torn open do to this failure in packing.The DVD drive would not open. I could hear it trying. It seemed like a mechanical problem. So I had two choices, send it back or fix it. I took it apart and fixed it. It was a tiny chunk of plastic blocking the release mechanism from operating. That was a challenge with no feeling in my hands, and then a tiny little spring went flying. I found it after a wile. lol  What a pain in the ass to work on such tiny things, WOW.
