{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bought this after returning a Lenovo T540p - this review is a bit of a comparison of these two top end systems (early 2014)", "Author": "Some Guy", "ReviewID": "RMQYH4WA14T4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is far superior.The T540p had the same 4800 processor, but it was clocked much lower.  It was apparently designed for battery life above all else.  It had sleep/hibernate problems and a screen flicker.  The Lenovo also had a really lousy touchpad that moved whenever you'd right click - with no physical button options.This Toshiba on the other hand - outstanding.  Although it might be more comparable to a Lenovo W series workstation than the T, at some point the configurations are more marketing than technical specs, and it's just a better computer.The screen is better than the Lenovo by a hair.  The case design is more attractive.  The lid is a tiny bit more flexible, but not substantially.  I was able to get a SSD for about the same price as a traditional HD on the Lenovo.It is significantly faster than the other 4800 setup - not underclocked to a paltry 2.7ghz.  My opinion: if you're paying for an i7 w 6mb cache, it should FLY - and the Toshiba does, whereas the Lenovo did not.Tons of ports - beautiful screen - reasonable battery life for such a hotrod - better trackpad - better numpad layout for a fullsize laptop.There is zero I don't like about this machine.  Granted you pay through the nose for this much juice, but if you have the right situation to buy it, or you're doing design work or video or data compiling - it's really something.  It will blow you away.Note - yes, the power supply is a small brick - hilariously enough the plug that goes from the adapter to the outlet is the same plug you'd use for a desktop power supply - but if you're buying this then you're probably not looking for an ultrabook in the first place.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Surprise, no service/parts manual available online or elsewhere", "Author": "charles h. \"Picky Consumer\"", "ReviewID": "R2IJXCHVPDNH1X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After I purchased this laptop, I found out to my dismay that it's Toshiba's policy not to provide documentation to end users--only to \"authorized service centers.\"  So if you want to repair/change something like a hdd, you need to take it to a support center unless you are comfortable taking something apart w/o documentation. (if you don't believe me, go to Toshiba's site and see what documentation is available--you'll find none.)Since my expectation is different from Toshiba's policy, I sent the laptop back to the vendor, took the 15% restocking fee, and ordered a Dell whose doc's are legendary.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Heavy huge power supply", "Author": "D.K.

It is NOT going to fit nicely in a  briefcase or computer bag. It does appear that alternate power supplies are available. Toshiba computer support argues that it is a \"workstation\" model. I would treat it as such.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,999.00", "Features": "Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 i7-4800MQ quad core processor\nWindows 7 Professional (available through downgrade rights from Windows 8.1 Pro)\n16GB DDR3L memory\n500GB (7200 RPM) storage\nNVIDIA\u00ae Quadro\u00ae K2100M discrete graphics", "Name": "Tecra W50-A1500 15.6\" LED Notebook - Intel Core i7 i7-4800MQ 2.70 GHz - Graphite Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41-gW5kfTvL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00G31W724"}}
