It suited my needs and I'm quite a Dell fan. I have the full HD version with a 500GB 7200RMP disk.The screen is bright (not perfectly even, but that is barely noticable) and crisp. The keyboard is a joy to type on (I don't like the chicklet keyboards you find on many notebooks today). I know, the keyboard catches dust and dirt, but if you're careful it is possible to remove a key to remove the dirt particle and refit it without breaking anything. When not under high load, the laptop is very quiet. When stressed, you hear the fan quite loud.Today I'm considering to add some more memory (2x4GB instead of the 2x2GB I have now) and replacing the hard disk with an SSD.I had to have the inverter of the screen repaired by DELL (luckily within the warranty period). One of the hinges has a crack in the plastic hull, the inner part is not broken though. Given the fact that I use the laptop every day for about 10hrs, dragging it from my desk to multiple meetings a day, I cannot but reconfirm my trust in the build quality of Dell.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needed a replacement computer decided on a Laptop", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RNYH2PJRG9TB5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received the item on time and took it out of the box and configured it with my own software.
