Average price/performance. USB ports grouped too close together. Nice plus is the PC Card/Express Card slot. No blu-ray drive - at this price it should have one. Too much bloatware although Microsoft Office trial and Thinkvantage Toolbox are easily uninstalled. Video card is decent (ATI Radeon 256 MB) but could be better at this price. Memory difficult to access for upgrades (must remove keyboard).", "Date": "May 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Non ergonomic design, lack of LED displays, heavy machine", "Author": "Think before u buy", "ReviewID": "RS6MFPV868S7V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "While performance of T500 is not bad, it has several flaws for anyone looking for a solid Biz machine and typing on in for hours.  First, the keyboard location/palm rest space is non-ergnonimic and will lead to wrist pain for anyone with medium to large palms. With mouse pad and related related clickable fields taking extra space, loudspeakers on the top taking space, there is not enough space to rest your palms - they end up resting on the edges and slipping off - putting pressure on your wrist area. This can lead to Carpal tunnel syndrom. Second, the location or finger reader is awkward - just under where you keep your hands instead on the side. Thrid, the weight of above 6lbs speaks against T500.  Another major flaws is that are no LED displays above 1280 resolution,  For serious user, better options are Dell E6500, and perhaps Apple until HP comes up with new series of laptops with LED displays.", "Date": "July 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Solid PC but hardware quality needs improvement", "Author": "Spike Spiegel", "ReviewID": "R1L6N5JFKDV8UE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "update (as of Oct 2012)the PC still works great HOWEVER the replacement fan has to be replaced AGAIN!  another $200-!do they make quality product anymore?  a PC should not require fan change once every year!i purchased this PC 2 yrs ago (2009)dislikes:1. poor initial quality.  3 days after delivery, the MB burned out.  had to take in to service center 10 miles away for authorization then waited for 2 weeks to receive new unit from HongKong (i was in US).2. poor cooling system.  2 yrs after purchase, cooling system (fancy name for fan) malfunctioned causing frequent system shutdown. CPU temp. got to 94C!!  warranty runs out in a year, i had to pay $200 to put in a new fan at Lenovo's authorized repair center.  tech sez an average fan lasts about 2 yrs!  i am like, my Walmart floor fan lasted 10 yrs!!!!likes:1. rugged and dull design. easy to travel with especially i am harsh on gadget. i treat computer mostly as work tool.  don't like the fancy design with multi color or shapes. Lenovo's black box works to my liking in a strange way.2. good value for the money.  i paid $1,600. came with the entire MS Professional Office, Mcaffee, 64G solid state drive. Core duo at 2.8 GHz. 4mg RAM. i don't need Blue Ray nor recordable DVD. i doubt Apple or HP offers comparable at this price band.if Lenovo improves on product quality, i will consider buying another Thinkpad in a few yrs.make a PC hardware problem free for at least 4 yrs... won't you?", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Product Features:\n- 2.26GHz Intel Core 2 Duo P8400 Processor\n- 2GB 204 Pin PC3-8500 DDR2 So-Dimm RAM (2 slots)\n- 250GB SATA 5400RPM Hard Drive, DVD+/-RW Drive; Finger Print Reader\n- 15.4\" (1280 X 800) 16:10 Display, Intel GMA 4500MHD Graphics", "Name": "Lenovo ThinkPad T500 Notebook - Intel Core 2 Duo T9600 2.8GHz - 15.4\" WSXGA+ - 4GB DDR3 SDRAM - 160GB HDD - DVD-Writer - Gigabit Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth - Windows Vista Business - Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418zaJw8ELL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001GEIZ9W"}}
