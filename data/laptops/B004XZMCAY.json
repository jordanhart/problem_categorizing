When it works it's great. It runs windows 7 wonderfully for web browsing and document editing. It is lacking in reliability.I had to send it back to Dell 1 month after I purchased it because it wouldn't turn on. Dell replaced the motherboard. Around 5 months after the first repair I had to send it back in to have the palm rest(touch pad) repaired. Now, 2 months after the second repair and 8 months after purchase it won't turn on again and is going to be sent back.I don't know about the rest of the world but I don't expect to have a computer fail 3 times in less than 9 months. I have had 2 other Dell laptops which have had no problem this model is poor quality and not up to dell's normal standards, or they have lowered their standards", "Date": "October 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "The DOCK Makes It", "Author": "John N. Sch\u00ebar \"cxxi121\"", "ReviewID": "R2RAVULQWQZQ5D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The duo itself makes a fine small (10.1\") computer and is quite capable even though it is a tad slow but it's not a powerhouse desktop either.  When the Duo is added to the Dock it makes a fine pair.  Sound from the stand alone Duo is minimal and barely a strength; however, when the Dock is added it makes a significant difference but, again, it is not a large set of stereo speakers either.  I usually turn mine on in the morning and let it run most of the time just to hear the background, music or internet radio.  I use an 8Gig flash drive to hold music and pictures; however, when I pair it with the desktop it will take several thousand Picasa pictures and show pictures all day.  This is not a tablet but a netbook computer and well worth it.  When it's time to go to the doctor and wait for what seems like forever I have my handy laptop and can use it for about 3 hours since my docs office has wireless.", "Date": "August 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fabulously Fun, but itsy-bitty battery charge", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1IAURUQBJML02", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been waiting to get this.  I love the multiplicity of it, but the battery charge is barely usable!  I had an HP mini with a battery usage ability of NINE (9) hours!  I knew this wasn't going to be THAT good, but didn't expect to have to charge it repeatedly in ONE (1) day!!  I'm a full-time college student as well s a homeschooling mom of 6, I do NOT like to be tied to a plug!  If there were anything else wrong with this, I would send it back ASAP!

There is no comparsion.  Even ignoring the difference in HD size.  The Dell just works wonderfully.  I have no issues with battery power, it lasts close to 4 hours, which is plenty. The screen is beautifly clear and the switch to a tablet works well. I bought directly from Dell however since they are now using a higher performance processor (also more energy efficient) that what is listed on Amazon. Also, I didn't want black. The keyboard is great and the mouse pad works better than anyone elses version that I have found.  I love the docking station. I also added Android apps which I find very usefull.  Dell's pricing was better than any sellers on Amazon as well. But, check around, that can change.I cannot explain the few bad reviews, I am very happy with the device and it's perfomance. I have been in the industry for many years, so I know how to evaluate performance properly. We have 6 dell PC's in the house and have never had a issue with any.  Maybe some do not know what to expect or how to understand what PC specs mean.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Don' bother.......Unless you are an IT pro wanting to work on it constantly!", "Author": "Quentin0352", "ReviewID": "R372FLZI4DIOO3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this a little over a week ago from a different retailer and have spent about as much time dealing with idiots at Dell who can only read a script as using it. It ran VERY slow from day one. I did all updates and everything I could think of to speed it up. All I wanted it for was basics like surfing the web, email and video watching. Well it did none of those well. Web pages moved slow and kerky when you tried to scroll them, same with videos both on the web and on the machine and I gave up on email since I was too busy trying to get it working.Of course the award winning Dell support in India had nice little scripts to read me to help. When you understood them over the cracking phone lines and accents it was OK as long as it followed their script. First thing was to try and run the tests, no problem except the tests which are part of the BIOS failed to launch. That should have been the first big flag on it! When that failed, they had me restore it to factory condition. Ok, easy enough and not like 15 years in IT would give me a few clues on this. I managed to do the restore no problems but then you have to run all those updates yet again. In between updates I did some of the basics like installing Office, seeing if it ran faster on videos and web and etc and it never did any better at those items.Then it suddenly started failing to boot on a restart with no screen at all showing. Several hard power downs and it finally booted to the BIOS to say it couldn't find an operating system!?!? Ok, hard boot down yet again to try and it manages to come up fine. At this point BIG red flags are wavign and alarm bells all over the place! Then it starts to update the recoverey partition from Dell and it did a blue screen of death near the end after the program had given a lot of warnings about not to power down or etc or it would risk damaging the system and etc.Ok, call that award winning service in India yet again. Oh, we need to run the diagnostics that they already knew it was not able to get in to and I told them when I explained the reason for my call. Well, we need to repair th operating system, the one it said it couldn't find at one point and you get after the BIOS boots that I pointed out it was showing major issues with. Also after I had been very careful to point out that the BIOS was showing serious problems and repairing things like this is what I do so may have a clue on the issue. Well maybe they would send me the OS disks to reinstall the OS that way? Yeah, the OS that won't load frequently because the BIOS doesn't load to be installed on a laptop from the disks when the laptop has no CD or DVD in it? Nope, not my job to fix this machine unless they wanted to pay me the $55 an hour standard rate for me to do my WORK on it.Yeah, one week old and this junk is going back to the retailer who DO have 24 hour support in the USA who can do more than read a script, understand the difference between an operating system and BIOS and don't expect me to repair a brand new laptop I just paid them hundreds of dollars for or to mess around with it until past the return date has past. I'll stick with HP who I can actually get people who know english, the difference between the BIOS and OS and have always been able to get me a higher level of tech support on request without me having to spend days on the phone begging while Tier 1 guys read me a script. They also are able to look in their database and see my name and info without as much cross referencing info as well as that I am an IT pro who deal with them at work too. Dell is too busy employing people in India with scripts for me to EVER touch their stuff again. Maybe if it works they are great but if that is their version of award winning service and support, I will stick to those who DO the job instead of buying awards to brag about!", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected", "Author": "Encyclops", "ReviewID": "RBMVFWPUNZHG7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From the reviews, I expected my new Duo to be slow. It's not. It's much faster than other netbooks I've used. I didn't get it expecting lightning speed, but I haven't noticed it being much slower than my 17\" laptop that has twice the RAM and a faster processor. I also haven't tried doing anything I knew it can't handle. I originally intended to put in a SSD to speed it up, but I don't think it's necessary now.I've heard bad things about the Dell Stage (what happens when you switch to tablet mode). Mine updated right away, so maybe that's why it doesn't lag. The only thing I had to remove right away was McAfee, to install my preferred anti-virus. Windows has been updating a lot, of course. I hope it isn't one of the updates that slows it down. Service Pack 1 hasn't.It's also a lot bigger than I thought it would be, but that isn't a bad thing. It isn't the same size as an HP Mini, which is about the size I anticipated. Not sure why, but I just pictured it smaller. I feel much better about the price after seeing how huge this thing is.One last thing. The dock is really great. The sound is much better than the Duo's speakers. It's nice to be able to put the netbook into the dock at night and just let it charge. I don't trust the power cord for the Duo itself. My last Dell went through several of those cords because of the weight-like thing that goes right by the power jack, and the jack itself ended up separating from the motherboard because of the weight. Netflix is good on the dock, too. The only thing I'd like to do that I haven't found a way to do is change the background for the dock clock thing.", "Date": "October 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Super slow and Terrible Customer service from DELL!!!", "Author": "icrews23 \"icrews\"", "ReviewID": "R2DIIMY5KS2UIA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my husband as a father's day gift and order it early so it would be there by father's day! Received it and has been nothing but a nightmare.*Don't buy from Dell directly, terrible customer service and terrible return policy on their items.  The computer arrived late and from the moment we turned it on the nightmares began.*The start up speed is so slow, I can basically turn it on and take a bubble bath and it will still be trying to get to the desktop.*The web speed is horrible.  We have super speedy internet connection and even with that the computer took forever just to go from one page to another.*When I tried to contact Dell and return it for something else, they told me from the minute you place the order your days to return it count!  Only 21 days to use and check out your computer to see if you like it.  They delivered it to me on the 11th day!  I fought hard to explain to them that 10 days is not enough time to use such an item and especially if you don't use it everyday.No way did I win on that.Now we are stuck with this super slow laptop/tablet wanna be, which keeps breaking down on us and it's only been 2 months! I suggest if you purchase a Dell product make sure you know your return days and check the date from purchase to the date of delivery.  Also, Costco has a much better policy and warranty for all their products, even Dell items.Now we are without a laptop, since it's out for repairs!", "Date": "September 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Better than most reviews claim.", "Author": "Brittany", "ReviewID": "R3UVBQ7CQ5ETMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recently I found out that for college I needed to have a tablet for the Adobe Suite. Since drawing tablets are fairly expensive I figured I would just buy a tablet pc (since the price range is so close) so that instead of just a touch pad, I'd be able to Photoshop on the screen. So far this netbook is AMAZING!!!! I downloaded Photoshop and was dreading that it'd be all laggy or something based on so many of the comments I had read, but to my amazement it worked. There is absolutely NO lag when I am drawing on the screen (although I did have to tweak the tablet and pen settings). Honestly, I can't find anything bad about it. It is very well built and sturdy. It is a little heavier than say an ipad, but this netbook has all the capabilities of any computer and doesn't run just straight apps like most tablets tend to do. I am not sure how there are so many bad reviews with lag. I mean if I downloaded photoshop, and that program uses tons of ram and resources and works with no lag, then why are so many people having this problem? For graphic design and animation I cannot afford lag as it will slow down my work process, but I found the make of it, the speed, and the hard drive space superb! Also, the docking station works really well. It is great for viewing as well as editing with sound. The speakers are very crisp. Overall, this laptop exceeded my expectations and for half the price, could probably compare to a higher end graphic arts tablet pc. I do suggest that if you WANT it for drawing and art, get two different pen styluses, one with a larger tip and one with a ballpoint tip, for broader strokes (shading) and really fine strokes (lineart).", "Date": "February 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "Roxie", "ReviewID": "R8T1ZOLQN9FAM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this about 8 months ago with the docking station and love it. It does run a little bit slower (not that bad) compared to some other laptops but this laptop is made to be portable. It is powerful enough to run Photoshop and play some games online.

About an hour if using something like Photoshop.", "Date": "November 21, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004XZMCAY"}}
