My laptop is a Intel Core 2 Duo CPU @ 3.06 Ghz 3.07 Ghz 6 GB Ram on a 64 bit operating system. Never had any problems with us, easy to walk with packs a punch and the HD screen is unbelivable in quality. I actually just saw two of these in a film I just watched, cannot remember the name its a spy one just out. Deffinatley recommend this to any buyer, mine cost like 2grand from dell so well worth the price your paying. - visit: [...]", "Date": "May 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good laptop if you have the patience to adjust for its quirks", "Author": "Ugapug", "ReviewID": "R2I8SCIGC7JJ39", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is powerful enough to run Star Wars:  The Old Republic at a playable framerate, so its gaming capabilities are not too shabby.  Make sure you're running the latest drivers available for it before stroking out about non-functional devices.  In particular, the HDMI out can be finicky until you realize that it needs a Realtek driver specifically for HDMI audio out AND the ATI driver for the video.Major issues:The lid/screen:  I recommend getting a piece of felt or sliding the bag the laptop comes in over just the lid area to protect the screen from the keyboard when its closed.  If you don't, you WILL get scratches on the acrylic cover over the screen.  This is a design compromise Dell took, and a bad one if you ask me.Power adapter:  If you look around for reviews of this laptop, there are a lot of unhappy folks about the way it throttles the system back, often making games and media unplayable/unwatchable.  This is 100% due to the inclusion of a 90W power adapter as shipped.  The first thing you should do is find the Dell replacement 130W adapter for this machine, (or hammer Dell support to send you one, politely mentioning \"throttling\"). This will prevent most if not all of the CPU slowdown issues.  There are other solutions, just keyword Dell XPS 1640 throttling and you'll find them.Heat:  It runs pretty warm.  This is due to the CPU/GPU sharing a heatsink and fan. Simple solution:  Get a laptop cooling pad.  Really, isn't your shiny new computer worth less than 50 bucks to keep the hardware cool?  Of course it is.Fingerprint NUCLEAR ELECTROMAGNET:  Yeah, it develops fingerprints insanely quickly.  Be prepared to wipe it down A LOT.Unless you just have to have the Dell Dock, get rid of it as soon as possible as it really slows down the system after login.All in all, it's a really nice laptop that's really pleasing aesthetically with very good performance.", "Date": "January 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good and bad", "Author": "DAG", "ReviewID": "R1WG1L5VBF6O7X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this computer for over two years. I upgraded my screen so it's the 1080p fancy one.Pros* Nice screen (I should hope so for an additional $400)* Keys are lit* Fast and powerful (I have upgraded GPU too)Cons* Screen is reflective like a mirror so good luck doing work where there is natural light (eg: airport)* The whole laptop has a shiny finish so fingerprints collect* The speakers have a large mesh-type surface that just gets full of dust/dirt over time* Runs hot!* Came with Vista - that's probably not the case now but it sucked at the time* HeavySo as you can see not too many problems for me. The aesthetic cons and screen reflectivity are what gives this laptop a four star. They're quite obvious faults that I knew were problems the moment it came out of the box ~ they're just stupid mistakes.All in all not bad. Note: if you buy this laptop used then its battery likely should be replaced. At this point mine lasts about an hour on battery with no music or video, no wifi, screen at the dimmest, etc.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great for anyone, not gamers", "Author": "Richard Sarno", "ReviewID": "R1CITNNWH5IPKL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop 8 months ago. Since then Dell has replaced the LCD, and 2 new motherboards. Something just keeps going wrong where i get a completely black screen ... the vidcard goes bad, which is attached to the motherboard. BUT the Dell service is actually exceptional, they are fixing it as needed for free, and nearly the next day.That aside, its an amazing machine! Gorgeous display, the light-up keyboard is one of the best i have seen, and a very functional machine!My one complaint is that it heats up like crazy! Not even mentioning the underneath, i mean even the top of it! Where your wrist sits when typing gets very hot. This is a known issue with this machine. But in my opinion, its worth it. I have to question the life of a machine that runs this hot though ...I upgraded everything possible on this machine because im a frequent gamer (well, the only game i play is Warcraft...). Dont expect this machine to be a beast in there! I have to adjust in-game video settings to lowest possible, and even then im at around 2-5 FPS in 25man content ... to anyone who doesnt know, this is not even playable. The reason for this, i later found out, is the onboard vidcard. Its a very capable card for anything but gaming. Mine has the ATI Mobility card and it sucks.This might sound like a negative review but its not. Most people are not trying to game on this system, those people will love this machine to pieces.BONUS: when you buy this pc from Dell you get a \"premium\" level of service. Separate phone number and everything! Any issues, and they don't even question it ... within 2 days you have a repair guy sitting at your dining room table with new parts in hand.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "dell studio xps 15.6 inch laptop", "Author": "Allison Dodge", "ReviewID": "R3F2X0C6EKC04O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent laptop, bought it as a gift and has proven itself to be everything a laptop should be. great for gamers and people really into downloading tons of music, the speakers are great! still surprising us with new things it is capable of doing! awesome!! totally love it!", "Date": "January 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "AVOID", "Author": "C.H.", "ReviewID": "RAVJRV7XOXN3S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop bluescreened within three hours of me turning it on for the very first time.  The dell support has been atrocious.  They delayed so long with callbacks and tests that I was out of the thirty day return policy before it was all done.  I got the two-year warranty but they refuse to take the laptop back and replace it.  It took me three months to convince them to replace the hard drive and the RAM.  Even then it took me demanding to talk to a supervisor and explaining that the computer froze on startup BEFORE reaching the Windows Startup screen and also froze whenever I tried to run check disk.I replaced the RAM and the hard drive.  That's when the random shutdowns started happening.  The computer, whether it was on battery or AC power, would just randomly shut off.  It would happen when the battery was completely removed, too.  All of the lights on the computer (the two hinge lights, the 'dashbord' lights, the light on the power button and the lights on the mouse and keyboard) just died and the computer wouldn't respond.  If I hit the power button, it would turn on again and give the 'windows did not shut down properly' so I knew it wasn't going into hibernate or some similar nonsense.  It took me four more months to convince dell that this was a real problem.  This time it took a two-hour call to tech support and demanding to talk to a supervisor, which I never got to do, for them to arrange for an on-site technician to replace the motherboard.They sent an EXCELLENT technician out, can't say enough praises about him, to replace the motherboard.  This work was done fast and the on-site technician was friendly and knowledgeable.Ever since the motherboard was replaced the computer begins to beep randomly and the sound sometimes glitches.  The beeps are incredibly distracting and I feel like I'm working on a bomb that's about to explode.  Sometimes the beeps can be stopped by blowing into the fan port...of which there is ONE.  This is a design flaw I'll go into in a moment.  The beeping is not coming from the speakers due to the fact that it continues even when the speakers have been turned off during shutdown.The laptop overheats at the drop of a hat.  Why?  Because the single fan port is COMPLETELY blocked by the screen when the laptop is open.  And I mean completely.The area the touchpad is on is a glossy black finish that shows dirt if you so much as breathe on it.  I've had to get a pair of fingerless gloves just so I can stand resting my hands on the surface, since it feels sticky and grimy after even ten minutes of use.Horribly designed, horribly made and horribly supported piece of junk.  Avoid unless you get one for free, even then, it'll be more aggravation than it's worth.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent purchase!", "Author": "Luis Varela", "ReviewID": "R34L1Y3RLHCLTN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are a student who needs one laptop for your scholastic works, this is for you.

The first one overheated to the point of burning the stickers on the back of the unit and developed video problems. Fortunately, I had purchased a 3 year in-home warranty. After replacing the motherboard twice Dell decided they would just replace the laptop with a new one when they realized it was also overheating.  At this point I was impressed. They sent me a Studio XPS 1640 and I thought things were great.  However, 1.5 years into the second laptop it also has developed video card problems after doing some Googling I have been able to determine that the video card in the motherboard is going south on yet another unit...grrrrrr.  It also gets quite warm but not hot enough to burn the stickers on the back. Clearly the high powered video card in these XPS laptops need chillers or something to keep them from dieing a much too early death thereby killing my very expensive laptop.Frankly, if I had purchased this at a box store and paid $500-$700 bucks for it would have been easier to accept but with a $1,600.00 price tag I am not happy.  Wouldn't you know my warranty ran out about a month before the video problems began on the second unit.  I will be going to a box store and buying a less expensive unit so when it dies I won't get so much heart burn...", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Former Loyal Dell Customer", "Author": "Dr. James E.

Every single computer I purchased, whether for office or home use was a Dell, without exception.  My Dell Studio XPS 1640 permanently cured me of such foolishness.That Laptop and the final two Dell products purchased after that one *nspiron and Alienware 17-X) provided the permanent cure of my sick relationship with Dell.  The only definitive comment I can make about these three models is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY FOR ANY DELL COMPUTER.  These three models, and I've heard of others too, are totally unreliable for anyone seeking reliable internet access.The method for establishing connectivity with the internet is their \"wireless connectivity\" key that is said tobe  located near the keybord. Push this key - along with a second OFTEN UNDESIGNATED OR UNIDENTIFIED KEY is auppose to whiz you off into Internet-Land.  Sadly, it almost never works.I've reported the problem while my laptop was stilll covered by the warranty.  They read me the instyructions and quickly got off the phone.

However, the more I used it, the slower it got. My brother and dad constantly have to download anti-virus software and go through and clean off my computer. then about a month later they have to do it again. When it get's slow it takes me about 15 minutes just to start it up, log in, and open up the internet. On my brothers computer it takes about 30 seconds. It is an okay computer for younger kids as a first laptop but after about a year or two, you may end up having to replace it. I constantly try to convince my dad to buy me a new one but that is no use. I am going into high school this year and it will be hard to do my homework and stuff quickly because  about 4-5 times this year, my computer just shut down on me in the middle of working on my homework or a major project. I can tell you that it pissed me off to no end when it did. I will have to buy a new computer that wont shut down on me and delete all my work.
