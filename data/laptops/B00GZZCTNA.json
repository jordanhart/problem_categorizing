{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Research pays - Know your device and OS", "Author": "LisaPcola", "ReviewID": "R29N2X0O1CUTY7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, my research for a new laptop which led me to the hybrids revealed that many online reviews are confusing the i3 (model 13-m010dx) and the NEW i5 (model 13-g110dx), across all website reviews.  Second, I work in I.T. and understand not only hardware, but that some people have a difficult time with change and learning curves with operating systems.  Users want stuff to work NOW and be easy, but often that means taking time to learn something new... like Windows 8.  Finally, my research is never just online, it's only an initial review before going into the store to look, touch and play with new technology for myself.  I'd never recommend making such an investment without a hands-on test as well.  This review is from the perspective of a tech-savvy user, not a higher-level I.T. professional, because I think the former is who will make best use of the information.  However, my recommendation would not change if my review had big geeky words and analyses in it.I found that most of the low reviews had to do with 3 things:1)  Confusion over the different model numbers.2)  People don't know/understand Windows 8, and want to right out of the box.  It's not going to happen.  Even \"experts\" have to learn the new operating systems that come out.  There are plenty of YouTube videos for all levels available.  Watch them, be set free!3)  People got a lemon.  It happens, and it really sucks.  I'd be mad too, and for all the years I've purchased technology, it's happened to me too.  If you order online from a seller who is also a local retailer, you can take advantage of their return policy and get the issues resolved quickly.I'm an open source/freeware lover, so I've never owned an Apple product personally, I tend to lean toward the less \"popular\" stuff.  My kids have iPods/iPads, because no one else had what they offered at the time... until Android tablets replaced their Apple devices. For my own purposes, I researched, purchased and fell in love with my ASUS Transformer Android tablet and keyboard.  It was this functionality that I was looking for in a Windows laptop.  The HP Split x2 i5 has everything I was looking for - as their slogan says, it's the ultrabook I need (as a writer/professor/IT professional) with the tablet I want.  Yes, it's a little bit of a heavy beast, but who cares? So is my SUV. If you have more under the hood and on the pavement, you'll have some trade-off.My observations:- The battery life is amazing.  I haven't gone past 60% drop in life whether using as a tablet or laptop, and use all day, every day so far.  But I also put it on the charger every night, just like I do all my mobile devices.- The keyboard is fabulous for a fast typist, laid out perfectly, best feel of all keyboards I tried in the store, and I typed on many.- The screen viewing quality is great; but in all fairness, I'm not a huge gamer or movie watcher on computer/tablet, so folks with a higher standard may not agree with me.  Because of the glass, there is some background glare (like from my Christmas tree lights behind me right now).  I'd recommend an anti-glare screen protector if glare is a complaint for you.- I have seen an issue that several online reviews mentioned - that the keyboard or mouse seem to freeze occasionally while in full laptop configuration.  In contrast to statements that this required the tablet and keyboard to be disconnected/reattached, I find that just touching the screen so the connection was recognized again resolved the problem, well, with the tap of a finger.  In my opinion, this is a Windows 8 hardware communications quirk that will work itself out in time.  For the record, I tested for a few days on Win8, then updated to 8.1, and haven't encountered the problem since, so Microsoft and HP may have already tag-teamed and fixed this issue with a driver update or two.- The processor/SSD/memory speed are really immeasurable at this point, because I haven't challenged this machine yet.  I'm a multi-task/multi-window spreadsheet-crunching user.  I do often close open apps in Windows 8 touch/tablet mode, just because I'm OCD about conserving resources, but I've seen no difference in performance when I have 20 apps or windows open.- Haven't had the experience mentioned in some reviews of opening the device on my lap and getting \"pinched\" by the hinge.  Easy solution - don't open the device on your lap if you're not wearing proper attire.  Seriously?As for the operating system environment, it's important to keep in mind that Windows 8 offers much the same that this hybrid laptop does - both a Windows desktop and touch-screen tablet experience.  Once you take the time to learn the difference, you will appreciate it.  Yes, I still occasionally balk at having to switch between the two, but I'll get used to it, just like I did every other change in OS interface back to DOS command line tweaks. Many of the \"cons\" that folks listed in online reviews about this machine had nothing to do with the hardware itself, but things about Win8 that they didn't understand or wanted to grumble about.  Okay, make a sincere effort for 30 days to learn what's new in Windows 8, and I'll wager that you will not only quiet down, but will appreciate some of the new features.  It's worth a shot.  As for me, I love this device, and highly recommend it.Now if the industry would just hurry up and make cool accessories for it, I'd be adding more stuff to my Amazon wish list!", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for students!", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "RRDIOIQZYAG7G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop a couple weeks ago from Best Buy. So far, it has been amazing. It is exactly what I was looking for in terms of speed and ease of use. I am a graduate student and it is perfect for what I need it for which is mostly writing papers and web browsing. I use it for many hours at a time and it never gets hot or loud because it operates on a solid slate drive instead of a hard drive. The SSD also makes it super fast. The touch screen very responsive and I love that I can detach the screen and use it as a tablet for recreational purposes. So far, there have had none of the issues that some of the reviewers mentioned on the Best Buy website. My only complaint is that it is a little top heavy because the SSD is in the top instead of the base. I definitely recommend this laptop for people who are relatively comfortable with technology and want a great convertible laptop for work/school and recreation.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Mouse Pad Driver Memory Leak", "Author": "jk777 \"Jakola\"", "ReviewID": "R1UR20DTCUXQ9B", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I would also give this 5 stars if HP would only get Synaptics (not sure if this is third party or a part of HP) to fix the slow memory leak in the Mouse Pad Driver. If you surf the web (or just leave it powered up) for several hours (5-6 hrs), the memory eventually max's out and the mouse pad becomes flaky and things slow down. Sometimes the cursor completely disappears. A reboot of course fixes this since it clears out the memory and it all starts over. Most will not notice it and just reboot when problems occur but the task manager will show the memory usage slowly increasing until it max's out. It still runs, just not as it should. If the mouse driver is disabled and the touch screen is used instead, there are no memory issues. HP refuses to look into this. I returned one of these thinking it was a hardware issue. Hopefully someone else will inform HP of this issue so they fix this.The nice things about this PC: no fan, not much heat either, great size, keyboard to tablet works great, mouse pad when it works properlyWill update to 5 stars if they ever fix the memory leak.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Computer", "Author": "A. Green \"Boilrmakr\"", "ReviewID": "R1FE5C091O1KO2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a tablet for reading books and such but also wanted something else to do \"real\" work. After researching I decided on the Split.I paid extra to get the full 1080 resolution monitor. I thought that if I am going to buy a computer that is going to last for years I may as well get the better display.The computer is heavy in either mode. Not so heavy as to be intolerable but you will want to set it on something if you are going to watch a movie or read a book. You can always use the keyboard for a stand but if you are in tablet mode you may not carry the keyboard with you.The keyboard is nice. The touchpad is hit and miss but works. The right button is quirky. I have not been happy with the way it works. Or more likely the way it doesn't work. I am taking a star from not being able to get to context menus from the touch pad.The computer boots and runs quickly. I can move between the desktop and \"Modern\" modes without a hitch. I haven't tried to play any games with it yet. Movies play very smoothly. I have watched two movies without any low battery notifications.The only problem is the lack of apps. This isn't an issue of the computer but of the operating system. I am used to the Android platform. I can find high quality apps to do what I want. I don't mind paying for decent apps. With Windows 8.1 the apps seem almost amatureish. I am hoping that future developers will clean up the market.After my warranty expires I will be installing 8 gigs of ram, upgrading the tablet sdd to a larger size and move the tablet drive to the keyboard.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop for the Family", "Author": "Jennifer Overton", "ReviewID": "R2L66CF4MCG04D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great, portable, functional laptop for my daughter and me to use. We love streaming tv shows and it worked well on our recent day-trip getting local info on the fly. It has been nice to be able to disconnect the screen to show pics to folks and use it like a tablet. Very impressive. It was easy to start up and I have not had any problems with its functionality.

There wasn't anything wrong with the other computer either, except it had no battery life left.This computer has been a nice addition, as it is lightweight, fast, and ultraportable.  I download a lot of my books, and having the \"split\" option makes it an easy tablet on which I can read any book.  When I first got this computer, the mousepad was a bit unresponsive at times, but either a system update fixed this, or it just took a few days to break in.  It has worked flawlessly since.I do wish you could upgrade the memory from 4gb to 8gb, but with the i5 quad core processor and 128gb SSD, this thing is plenty fast.  I wouldn't get something like this if your \"primary\" use would be gaming, but for school and home-use, with moderate graphic capabilities, this is a great deal.

My old laptop booted so slow that (I used windows 7) that I found out that the windows logo will actually restart those little colorful balls that spin around and join together to make a windows logo.. I used to start it up and make some tea, cook dinner and then finally get to use the stupid thing.  Oh and don't get me starts on if I forgot to send a message on facebook or an email and shut the computer down...Anyways, I don't touch this laptop until I need to use it.  I sit down get ready to do what I need to do and turn it on.  6-9 seconds later... yes I timed it.  Faster then a rice burner getting to 60.  Holy crap.  If I forget to do something... well 6 seconds and I am up and running.Fast portable!  Only annoying thing is the damn track pad has a feature where if you slide your finger from off the trackpad onto the pad it pulls out some tab and frankly annoys the crap out of me.
