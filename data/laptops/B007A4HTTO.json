It arrived in perfect condition like new with preloaded software, even more than I anticipated, in only 2 days! I wasn't expecting it before 3-5 business days.

It had a small window that came up every time the system was booted for no apparent reason, couldn't find me, fan made noise, and other issues.

The seller had great feedback guaranteeing super service.  My husband and I unpacked it, it worked for about 5 minutes.  The battery was completely dead.  I located a local vendor on Christmas eve so my son could have a working laptop on Christmas day -- paid $100 for the battery and that worked for a few minutes.  Researched online to find out this laptop works best w/Dell battery.  I called the company that sold us this piece of junk, explained the problem and was asked, \"what do you want us to do about it?\"  Nice service, huh?  She then proceeded to tell me she would transfer me to tech service and hung up on me.  I will be returning it.  Not great service at all!!!
