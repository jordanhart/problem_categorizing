It boots in around 20-30 seconds and is really fast in High Performance mode. It can even run Starcraft 2 with no problems. For the people that say it's slow, have you looked to see what mode it's in? It has 4 operating modes. High Performance, Entertainment, Quiet Office, and Battery Saver mode. It comes with Battery Saver mode on default so make sure to change it. If your looking for a really good laptop for a fair price then this is the one to get.Update:I have now had this laptop for almost three years and it is still holding up very well. By now the hardware is slightly outdated, but it still performs exceptionally. Over time the laptop has slowed down a little bit, but I have counteracted by upgrading the RAM prebuilt into the laptop. I still use it for mid-level computer games and for other day to day uses which it is very well suited to do. If you take of this laptop it will perform great for a long period of time and makes a great cheap device.I only docked a star from it's rating because of the slow down over time and because the laptop is actually an ASUS K53U and not an A53U. I have no idea why Amazon has it listed as an A53U as you can find no details on the ASUS site about an A53U. Otherwise this is a great laptop!", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Replacement Computer for the money", "Author": "khaos", "ReviewID": "RKNXSNGSIZPW2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is not going to be extremely in-depth, because I bought this computer for my dad for Christmas and only used it for about 2 days to get everything set up on it. Side note: My personal computers are Macs, but I am not extremely biased on operating systems, and I think Windows did a good job with 7. That being said, here is my initial impression on the computer.The shipment of the laptop was quick and free (thanks Amazon Prime)! Packaging was minimum, but definitely secured and padded the laptop, which is a bonus in my eyes.Upon opening the packaging, the computer looked sleek. It seemed like it was made not as study as a MacBook Pro (my Mac side showing), but it also wasn't cheaply made. It's made with plastic, which allows for it to be lighter and hopefully more durable.Windows 7 Home Premium came with it, which is a nice upgrade from the basic, but it came loaded with all the Asus add-ons and slowed down the performance greatly. On start-up, the computer was using about ~65-70% of the memory performance. There was A LOT of programs running that was bogging down the performance. The very first thing I did was install a fresh copy of Windows 7 Home Premium and wiped the hard drive of all the nasty programs. The Windows 7 disc didn't come with the computer, so it may help to have a friend that has a physical disc and you can just load your OEM Windows key that came with the computer (on the box).Once a fresh Windows 7 was installed, the computer ran like a dream. It is mainly being used for web surfing and light office work. I haven't received a call with any problems with it, so it's holding up!If you are looking for a high-performing laptop for gaming or other CPU-intensive tasks, this obviously isn't the best choice computer for you. But for daily web browsing, word processing and less demanding CPU/GPU tasks, I recommend this laptop!I highly recommend installing a fresh Windows 7 as soon as you pull it out of the box, and of course use protection! Windows has free software that works great for personal computers. You can't go wrong.", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Laptop!", "Author": "Pat", "ReviewID": "R1IXUPZOFQTO7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased this to replace a Gateway laptop and I have to say so far this ASUS is an excellent little computer!

I am using it to replace my much more robust HP Pavilion 17 inch laptop, which is not that portable.  The HP works great as a home computer, but is heavy and cumbersome for travel.  This new ASUS is just right for travel.  It is light weight, and the screen is big enough to work remotely.  It works great as an extra computer (as I also have a desktop.)  It is the perfect device that is in between my Xoom Tablet and My HP Desktop.

As always it runs instantaneously after a clean reinstall, but users should be aware that the cam software package will not work when installed from Asus Downloads webpage for this model.  This means you can't look at yourself with various controls to tweak appearance.  However the cam still works with the Win7 driver given for real-life needs like Skype or Video chat that rely on those 3rd party programs.Use free MS Security Essentials AV for best performance, with all startups except AV turned off in msconfig>Startup and >Services after hiding all MS services.Clean reinstall requires the quick robocall activation necessary when the COA sticker containing Product Key has OA (offline activation) after the version name. You can google the official Win7 ISO download to burn to DVD.Other than using the drivers which Win7 delivers in installer and are updated quickly via optional Windows Updates, I did also import the model's chipset which often adds functionality on laptops.  I noticed no additional performance gain.  The laptop has  instantaneous and feather-light performance which is what one should expect with Win7, after conquering the factory bloatware which throttles and corrupts the best OS ever.gregrocker, Guru at SevenForums, top Windows 7 forum on the web.

The touch pad is great. I can pinch and spread my fingers to zoom in and out, and the area around the touch pad has some sort of cooling system, which is pretty neat too. When in power saving mode, the battery lasts for quite a long time.Many people on here gripe about slow internet performance, but this laptop works just as well online as my sister's Macbook Pro does. I really think that it just depends on how good your internet connection is.This laptop comes with a starter version of Microsoft Word and Excel. If only it came with PowerPoint...looks like I'll have to buy that separately. Still, I was impressed that it came with an actual version of Microsoft Word instead of Microsoft Works like my other Asus laptop had.The price is unbeatable, especially with the included warranty. I read through it, and it looks like pretty much everything other than theft and weather disasters are covered.

The touch board is almost worthless.This is the first time I wished to have my old mouse back. My thought on buying this was that for 349.00 and no extension warranties or sales tax, when it screwed up I could just throw it in the garbage and buy another one.Unfortunately I think I am just going to throw this thing in the garbage and go back to an HP computer which was 10 times the machine for a hundred dollars more.Why on earth would anyone make a touchboard that works like this one does? For some reason it takes forever to load and is inferior in every respect.Now I have had about a week with this thing I want to expand my review. I found the high performance setting on this and tried it out. It just gets me to the wrong page quicker. The touch board is so sensitive that your finger doesn't have to be on it to change the page. The scroll works when it wants and I have to use the arrow buttons to get anywhere. If this is high performance than they should have  never offered any other setting for it.The worst part is I bought this for a backup computer almost 6 months ago and just took it out of the box now. If I return it, it will be pro rated and I would have to pay for shipping. I will buy a HP and throw this travesty in the dumpster. I do not blame amazon for this, but I will never buy another item from asus.Every computer that I have ever bought has been an improvement on the one before. This one is on par with my first Gateway which was so obsolete that it was given to me.Do not let the price beguile you.

I held off writing this review for several weeks, hoping that my experience would improve but it has not.While it is a functional computer, this is one of the slowest laptops I have ever owned.  It has several power settings, including one called \"High Performance\" but it is more realistically a \"Slightly Below Average Performance.\"  I first noticed the speed in how long it took to boot up and shut down.  Later, when I would install a program, I would have to wait at least a minute before the InstallShield program would even begin.  I'm not sure what goes on for a minute between clicking Install and the Install Program beginning, but I've never had a computer that was this slow.A couple other annoyances:1.  The DVD drive sounds like an airplane is taking off when it's initially reading a disc - I let a friend use the laptop once to watch a DVD and he hollered at me in a semi-panic because of the noise of the DVD drive.2.  The computer seems to adjust the power settings on its own.  I may have clicked on High Performance but the computer will just change into Battery Saver mode seemingly at random, which dims the screen and slows the programs.  So I have to then minimize whatever I'm working on and put the power back on High Performance.  It's not the end of the world but it's annoying.I wish I could return the computer for a different one, however, I bought it before going to live outside of the country so now I feel stuck.

I setup the laptop for her.  It's a good laptop overall.  It has a DVD burner and an HDMI port, which is great for viewing stuff on an HDTV.  Some reviewers have written that the computer is slow and unsuitable for web surfing.  That seemed like a bogus claim given the 3 gigs of RAM and the dual core processor.  In fact, the computer performs very well.  Webpages, including YouTube, load quickly and smoothly.  Of note, I had immediately set the computer to high performance.  Perhaps the people who gave this computer a bad review did not have it set to high performance.  Physically, the computer seemed sturdy and well constructed.What I didn't like so much about the computer were the viewing angles on the LCD screen and the speakers.  If a person looks at the LCD screen from an angle, the screen does not look as good.  The speakers are not at all powerful.  A user would probably need to purchase a speaker system to enjoy music or videos.For the price, this is overall a very good system.  4 stars....", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Peice of Junk", "Author": "Space.Folklorist", "ReviewID": "R2DAKKRI7SEYV5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This computer has not worked properly since I received it only a month ago.
