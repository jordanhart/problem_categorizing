{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "B. E. Hill", "ReviewID": "R1I0VDXAXFZRR2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this computer for about a year or so.  I keep it on a TV tray beside my recliner.  Needless to say it gets much more use than my desktop unit...lol.  Basically I use it to surf the web and check email.  I'm sure it is capable of much more demanding tasks with the I5 processor and Windows 8.  Not a minute of trouble with this one since I took it out of the box.  I love the big screen.  It boots quickly.  Just my opinion, but the sound on all laptops is terrible, so I invested in the Klipsch ProMedia 2.1 system and keep it on the hearth beside this laptop.  Wow, what a combination.  Granted I rarely move this laptop around but it would only be a matter of disconnecting 2 or 3 cables, and I'm gone!  Similar computers with this screen size and performance capability easily cost twice as much.  I highly recommend this unit.  I cannot comment on ASUS customer service because, fortunately, I have not had the need to.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am well pleased with my ASUS R704A.The 17.3\" screen is terrific and the machine is fast with the basic 4GB memory!", "Author": "D.K. Wagner", "ReviewID": "R3G1TJAFZ8XE02", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A back-lit keyboard would have been nice, but this is a fast and cool running piece of hardware. I've used it about 4 months and am very pleased. I asked two sales techs and the service manager at Micro Center which brand had the fewest returns. They all independently said Asus. I even had them test the second 4-GB memory slot to make sure it worked and it did. I'm going to add the extra memory stick for Christmas:-)  The only negatives? Windows-8 of course which can be worked around after a few days of hassling with it. I need to update it to 8.1And there was no OS disc and no BlueTooth, so I added an IOGear for $19. and both it and the on-board WiFi have worked beautifully.  I use the machine for database app, DJ'ing, Email, Surfing, Remote & Virtual Machine access. If you only want one computer, this is a good benchmark value.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "lees86", "ReviewID": "RF4O9IWDV70T1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this for a great price and has everything BUT the backlit keyboard that was on the page was incorrect. Although this was a major let down the price for an i5, 17.3\", with 4GB of RAM was still a great price. I had done research on this laptop before buying it and knoew that was a possibility. It is very fast and provided you use it as a work computer (with maybe a little light gaming from time to time) it should last for a long time.", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Sad had to return!!", "Author": "Donna Lotts", "ReviewID": "RMGSBJ7WJKPKO", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The customer service with the company was stellar.  The return was smooth, our credit was instant. The description stated this laptop had a back-lit keyboard.  The was a must for us.  Sadly the description was wrong; it did not have a back-lit keyboard so we returned it.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a positive experience", "Author": "Jama", "ReviewID": "R2MK0OD8BXSUL9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I regularly shop on Amazon.com because of the convenience, the reviews and the customer service.  The experience was not a positive experience customer service wise.  Initially based on the specs and the price I was really impressed.  I confirmed the specs with the company prior to ordering so I was very disappointed to see that the laptop did not have the backlit keyboard that was initially listed in the specs on Amazon.com. Mistakes happen but the way they handled the mistake insured that I will not be a return customer. Amazon has since been updated to include the correct information but it was done in a dishonest manner following an e-mail exchange with the company that was very frustrating.  At no point did they offer a resolution or an apology for the error.  So the two stars is not for the product but for the seller.  I gave a bonus star because after several e-mails were exchanged they did finally take an acceptable tone but I was still out of a laptop.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009AF6E9W"}}
