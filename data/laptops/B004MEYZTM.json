Cline \"Phoenix\"", "ReviewID": "RMOEYWJDGBTFS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We didnt get this laptop from amazon, but figured it would be nice to leave a review. My wife had a Toshiba laptop she bought in 2010 and after a few spills and damages from the kids the laptop fried in 2011. We took it to best buy where we got it and got this laptop as a replacement because of our protection plan. This laptop was actually more in replacement cost then her old laptop, but the store was past closing time by the time they were ringing us up and they just had a manager adjust the cost difference.This laptop runs great, and has lasted our kids. The screen is glass covered and protects it from damage. The aluminum is a nice touch, but more of a preference. The chicklet style keyboard makes for a more simplistic, less cramped, keyboard. I prefer full sized keyboards with number pads for gaming, but this laptop was nice because I didnt have to worry about hitting too many buttons at once when I was moving around too much in the game.The laptop works to play skyrim, battlefield 3, and many other games that I want, while my wife has a very portable laptop to tote around to wherever. The battery is good, the build quality is great, and for the price and value its definitely a winner. We even spent just a little bit of cash to upgrade to 8gb ram, and makes this all the better.I have used many machines, I build computers, repair them, etc. So I know what to look for in a good laptop, and this definitely set the bar for similar value laptops.The bottom line is that this is a good machine, and a great value for the price. For anyone looking for a nice laptop that has enough power to do what you need, without feeling like you are carrying around a bag of bricks then this is the perfect laptop.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best laptop I've owned", "Author": "Zach B", "ReviewID": "RD1EB4UAVARFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this puppy for $800 new a few years back.

They may not be treating it right, because this laptop has a special option that extends battery life by charging up to 80% when on AC power. My battery still has enough power on full charge to give it 4 hours of use! I bought May 2011, and it's still running just as fast as it did when I first bought it. Whatever Samsung did with this computer, I'm sure their newer ones are even better! Great laptop, I probably won't get a new one until I've drained the life out of this one, probably in another 2 years!", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "good for me", "Author": "kenny belcher", "ReviewID": "R31EPE5ZEU23OS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like the computer given me no problems I have a few games on it and just Browse the Internet .other then that I don't do much more with it and can't say much more about it", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "tempermental touchpad", "Author": "crank", "ReviewID": "RNUJ4N6LVNLN7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just wanted to say that the samsung touchpad is overactive, producing undesired clicks and gestures. The touchpad driver offers no settings to adjust sensitivity or to automatically disable whilst typing. The only remedy seems to be manually inactivating the touchpad by pressing Fn-F10, and constantly toggling the feature is tedious.This pitfall certainly wasn't apparent while shopping for this notebook, and hopefully I'll remember to scrutinize it more closely in my next purchase.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY A SAMSUNG LAPTOP!!", "Author": "busymassstudent", "ReviewID": "R1JQQCWHC181ET", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First off, I've owned this laptop for 15 months, and it is a nice looking laptop, is fast, and offers plenty of space (640GB). There is another review here about the tempremental touchpad - I agree 100%. My primary complaint is with Samsung, and with it's so called warranty. Six months after the purchase, my laptop got to the point where it needed to be plugged in 100% of the time. I would, at most, have 10 minutes of un-tethered laptop use. I called Samsung, thinking that it was a battery problem and asked for the battery to be replaced. I was told that this was not covered under warranty (which came as a shock to me), and they ran me through a diagnostic battery check with maybe added 10 minutes to my unplugged use, so the call to Samsung was useless. Battery life consistently got worse, so I decided to bite the bullet and just get a new battery. I had previously owned a Dell, so I thought popping in a new battery would be an easy and productive fix. Which brings me to the next topic - it's an internal battery - YOU CANNOT CHANGE THE BATTERY YOURSELF!!! Batteries plus can't do it either. Best Buy (where I bought the laptop) told me a new battery would run $120-$200 to change the battery, $100 or so for the battery, plus another $80-$100 to have someone \"install\" it. I paid over $800 for this laptop, and I think that A) Samsung should cover batteries under their warranties, and B) I should not be had this problem with a 6 month old laptop, and C) I should be able to change the battery myself.  After this experience, I will not purchase a laptop with an internal battery, it's a deal-breaker.", "Date": "September 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Battery disaster", "Author": "Wil", "ReviewID": "RRYXX46CCWA7T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "14 months after buying the QX-410 from Best Buy, the battery died. I went back to Best Buy and was told that the warranty had run out and the only thing they could do was replace the mother board for $700 since the battery was soldered onto the motherboard. So instead of a $40 replacement battery, it's $700 for a motherboard. Bottom line: DON'T BUY THIS ONE! When it's going to cost $700 a year for a battery, nothing else matters.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Ultra-thin aluminum design with black keys and LCD bezel\nMicrosoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit pre-installed w/CoA and reinstallation partition\n6-Cell Li-ion battery\nIntel Core i5-480M 2.66 GHz CPU\n4 GB DDR3 SDRAM (supports up to 8 GB, actual available memory may be less)", "Name": "Samsung Laptop / Intel Core i5 Processor / 14\" Display / 4GB M", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41a2fJwJpkL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004MEYZTM"}}
