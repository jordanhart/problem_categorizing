{"Reviews": [{"Title": "great laptop!", "Author": "Julie Pratt", "ReviewID": "R1SQITJJ741JUM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this laptop a couple days ago so I can not speak to it's longevity but so far I absolutely love it! I read alot of reviews about windows 8 and was kind of nervous about having it. Now that I have used it I can see how some people may have trouble adjusting to it but I found it very easy to use and intuitive. Windows 8 was designed to be used with touchscreen so it is really important that you get a touchscreen computer if you want to fully enjoy windows 8. I have been using a kindle fire as my computer for the last year so the touchscreen purchase was a no brainer for me, and i am sooooooo glad I did. It is awesome!  I have used alot of HP products over the years and have really enjoyed them, this one is no different. The keyboard is really nice, alot easier than my ancient laptop I was using prior to my fire. The comp. itself is quick on the startup and switching between apps and programs. I like how the keyboard is set in farther than my previous laptop. It allows my wrists to rest  flat on a shelf instead of angled, if that makes sense.  As far as the touch screen goes you will not be disappointed. You can switch immediately between touch and keyboard or mousepad without changing any settings. I was wondering about that before I got it. I can swipe, tap, drag, type on the screen or on the keyboard fluidly without any messing around with settings.  I could go on forever about how much I love this thing but I won't. Basically, buy it. You will not be disappointed!!!", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great PC", "Author": "AuthorAmandaDavis", "ReviewID": "R3PZ7SWFOP7AE3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like my HP Touchsmart Laptop. I spent months researching which computer I wanted and I finally settled on this one. I've only been using it for about a month, but so far I have no complaints at all with the the computer. I have no major complaints about Windows 8 either, just a few minor annoyances, but that is with the OS not the actual PC. I love the touchscreen feature and am really glad this is the computer I decided to go with.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not bad but .......", "Author": "john acquaviva", "ReviewID": "R2INYDGZJQYZ56", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Kept losing internet connection????All other computers in home didn't.Purchased Apple and no issues but expensive.Daughter loved touch screen but was frustrated with losing connection.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Starter Touchscreen Laptop", "Author": "Adam Boettcher", "ReviewID": "RS6AG8JHRCVTZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I have liked the different aspects of this laptop in terms of the touch screen and interact-ability with Windows 8.1.  That being said the processor is slow and lacks power at times.  The only negative of this is the fact that it takes a couple extra seconds for web pages to load, which at times can be irritating.  It can also be a little noisy when trying to load different programs and pages.  As I stated in the title though it is a good starter laptop.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "Intel Pentium N3510 QC 2.0 GHz\n4 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n750GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen, Intel HD\n6.07-hour battery life", "Name": "HP 15-d040nr 15.6-Inch Touchsmart Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pFv6UetQL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HC068H0"}}
