{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very happy", "Author": "Scott Reyes", "ReviewID": "RFHFJMZ6PQJSN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before purchasing this laptop. I mean tons. :) I've had nothing, but a great experience so far. Not a huge fan of Windows 8, but really who is? That really doesn't pertain to the laptop since most laptops now come with it now anyways. It only took me a few days to really get the shortcuts down, which really helps. As far as the laptop goes though, it's been fantastic. Not a single issue yet. Runs smooth, very large screen, not too big and bulky & holds a very good charge. Honestly I don't really have a bad thing to say about it. Hopefully this review will help anyone else, like myself, who is very thorough about their research. Happy shopping! :)", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Thomas C.

Mason", "ReviewID": "R2F82VJ9DMAAIQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is now my fourth HP laptop. My previous one's video card went out (Long story). I needed to get a quick replacement. I found this one to be one with specs that met/exceeded that one. HP laptops had an issue with heat; the new laptops have new cooling systems and a small cooling program that will save any files and shut down the laptop before it overheats. The icon is on the system tray.I ordered from Amazon which arrived in 2 days; while I was at school. I hated being there while it arrived.Specs:Windows 8  64-bit750G HD4G RAM2.9Ghz to 3.4Ghz AMD Dual-Core A6-5350M Accelerated ProcessorDVD optical drive3 USB ports1 VGA port1 external monitor port (I have a second monitor)Digital media card readerInternal Microphone with HP Truecam (Whatever that is)TouchpadI had to install my security programs and update them on the laptop once it was setup. I'm still not a fan of Windows 8. I've brought back the Start Menu so it's like 7. Then I had to install Chrome, Firefox, iTunes, Office, etc. and updates. That took TIME.I can't say too much about it after 2 days. So far it is a slight improvement over my old one. No complaints so far. IE however IS the complaint which has nothing to do with the laptop.Pros: HP Cooling Tech Major plus (It's what killed my last laptop. HP Fixed it. Monitors and keeps newer laptops from overheating)  Lighter weight.  Faster processor than my previous laptop. (mine was 2.4)Cons: None so far.May update if things change.Quick update: When making recovery disks: Use DVD+R. I tried using DVD-R and those did not work. With Windows 8 you can use a flash drive with a minimum of 21G, however data drives are small. Whatever your choise it's up to you. I also recommend to burn a System Repair Disk (1 DVD) which is different than a System Restore disk. Keep these in DVD cases stored away from kids in a place they can be found if needed. Make these once your computer is set up, antivirus programs, security, etc all is up and you've probably been using it about a week. I might back up any other data (Pictures, music, secure documents) on an external drive; I never keep that stuff on my computer for long in case it goes out like my last one.", "Date": "October 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP Laptop", "Author": "Bajan4life", "ReviewID": "R1ISVC80BCO4U3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like it great deal and it runs great!

I normally go to my local OfficeMax to purchase my electronics. But I could not find a computer that would be just right for my online classes so I looked through amazon. I have have this laptop about a week now and I am just 100% in love with it. I see people complain about how annoying windows 8 was but app screen provided me with videos and walkthroughs about the laptop. I have been enjoying this laptop since then.I chose to rate this 5 stars because not only does it provide me with everything I need for school but the cooling system is just amazing. I can actually place it on my lap with out feeling any heat coming from it. That was one of the biggest issues I had with my HP Pavilion g6 Dandelion Breeze windows 7 premium.The only thing that got on my nerves at the beginning is that the start up is a bit slow and when I watch videos on youtube it keeps buffering so I do not get to enjoy the video to its full capacity.  Other than this I love the laptop I would recommend it to anyone who needs a great laptop for multiple uses.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price!", "Author": "SlvrWolf", "ReviewID": "R2Y3TZIEEXC2PQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have not found anything wrong with this laptop!

Ohh and another thing , it can play well in  runescape and has a lot of updates to catch up so the system can run smoothly hope this will help make your decision easier.
