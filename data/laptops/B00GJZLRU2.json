I would have loved a black Aluminium finish to spice things up.- Battery life is OK", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Only Beautiful on the Inside.", "Author": "M.S.", "ReviewID": "R3SQ2861E7WKO5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After four months using the Galago UltraPro I cannot recommend this as a laptop. But first let\u2019s cover The Good Points:-Lots of useful ports-All USB 3.0-Slim and sleek design-Lightweight-Ubuntu run well on the unit-Keyboard is solid-Great speakers-Very nice camera-Full ethernet jack-Great ventilation. Does not get hot at all.The above all all very nice and, in my eyes necessary in a good laptop. But there are too many detractors that outweigh the good. Here are the Bad Points:-The 1080p screen is very, very fuzzy and dull. Even at the highest brightness settings it is hard to see clearly. I thought that maybe there was a driver issue but after much testing and trying different flavors of Linux I\u2019ve come up with no solution.-Bad Build Quality: The laptop is not falling apart by any means but the unit flexes, deforms and bends in ways that a laptop just shouldn\u2019t. The screen is so flimsy that I\u2019m afraid that it will break just by me closing it. When typing the gray plastic around the keys and on the palm rest flex into the unit. Nothing on this unit feels \u2018solid\u2019 at all.-The awful trackpad is next to impossible to use. It\u2019s very sensitive and when a right click is attempted the cursor flies off in a random direction. Tap to click works with no issues, but left-click will send the cursor shooting down into the bottom right of the screen every time. Two finger left-click works fine, most of the time. Use an external mouse-Palm detection is a joke. Most laptops realize that when a user is typing and their palm barely caresses the touchpad, it\u2019s not supposed to moved. Not this touchpad. The cursor will fly around the screen like an over-excited jack russell terrier.-I am very surprised at how slow this machine is. It\u2019s got an SSD, 16GB RAM and a Haswell chip. Why does it take up to 2 minutes to boot to the login screen? It\u2019s overall performance is not that good. I ran some benchmarks and they all came back rather high but the unit does not seem to process at the speeds the benchmarks say I\u2019m getting. I tried Debian and Mint and a fresh Ubuntu install but none of them seemed to speed up the unit. I could be just a perception thing but the machine boots slower than my work PC (without an ssd).-Flaky wireless is an issue. If anyone (or one of our pets) stand between the wifi router and the machine, wifi drops. Does this with any linux distro. It\u2019s very strange.I'm disappointed in this laptop but I'm not made at System76 since they are not the ones who make the chassis. That's Clevo. In the future I hope they are able to get a better unit from them. Overall, I cannot recommend this machine as a laptop. As a desktop it\u2019s great! But that defeats the purpose.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "great value", "Author": "Michael Daryabeygi", "ReviewID": "R2CSFUELH347D7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "yes, the case is a little cheap feeling, but put a few stickers on the lid, and you are good to go.The keyboard is more of an issue. Not having dedicated volume keys, or a caps-lock light, are significant drawbacks.However, the screen resolution and excellent performance let you forget the other drawbacks.A general sturdy feel, I don't plan to get a protective case for it which will just add weight to a nice light laptop.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "I regret buying a Galago UltraPro.", "Author": "Smittie", "ReviewID": "RE9QNA3U2DWCD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought from System76. I regret the purchase. I wish I had gotten a Dell XPS 13 Linux model instead. The Galago is a good collection of chips wrapped in a cheap, flimsy case.
