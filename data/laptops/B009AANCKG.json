It's great for home and small business use where portability is desired. Functions best with at least 4GB of memory (has 2GB stock). It's not good for high demand gaming as there isn't enough \"horsepower\". Battery life is about 4 hours, depending upon internet use. Complaints have been made about the wireless card dropping the signal frequently. My unit has the Broadcom wireless adapter. The driver provided is poor. Merely go to the Device Manager in Windows, select the Broadcom wireless 802.11n and replace the driver with the one provided by Microsoft (5.100.245.20). In addition, in the Power Options go to the Advanced portion and set the wireless adapter to \"Maximum\" on both battery and plugged in. This change avoids internet drops if the wireless is unused for several minutes. Very pleased so far - let's see what the future holds.UPDATE Aug 2013. This unit functions well for business use using programs such as Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. It slows a bit if several programs are open at once. If that's a task parameter you need, get the I5 processor version which my wife uses. Internet function is fine with very good range and no drops. As noted previously, it's not good for demanding games. Nice and light for traveling. I'd buy it again for sure.", "Date": "May 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great netbook!", "Author": "Kathryn J.

I was in search of an inexpensive, small laptop to do some light web surfing/research and word processing. In the week that I've had it, I am very pleased!The first thing I did after booting up the netbook (to make sure everything loaded up okay), was install more RAM ordered from the Crucial website, because they guarantee the correct size for your machine. This netbook only comes with 2 GB of RAM, which I was afraid wouldn't quite be enough to handle my multi-tasking. There is one 2 GB stick in one slot, and there is another slot that is empty. I upgraded to the max amount of 8 GB with two 4 GB sticks. The bottom plate was relatively easy to remove and the slots are there in the center, plain as day. I believe this will allow the netbook to run at its best.The processor is weak, so boot up, shut down, and opening programs is going to take slightly longer than you're used to if you've been working on a newer desktop with a big, shiny processor. I don't need a super fast processor to play Diablo on this thing, so I can wait an extra second for load time. It doesn't bother me, because I expected it.I am very pleased with the size of the screen and the keyboard - it feels almost like 100% of a regular keyboard. (I think maybe it's 92%? Not sure.) Sound quality and video playback from YouTube videos have been satisfactory. Not mind blowing, but no glitches either. Some reviewers have commented on the poor sound quality, but I don't have an issue with it.On the negative, there are 3 issues:1. The top of the machine has a shiny, glossy surface which is pretty, but attracts my grubby fingerprints like the dickens. But that's merely aesthetic, and the box comes with a cleaning cloth.2. I have been having recurring issues connecting to Wi-Fi networks. I usually need to run the troubleshooting app to fix it, and then all is well. This, of course, may be due to my own lack of knowledge regarding IP's and network configurations, etc.3. Personally, I have found that the battery will last me only about 3.5 hours on average. This is a bit shorter than I'd like, but still functional.Overall, I think this netbook is a perfect fit for anyone with needs similar to mine - word processing, web surfing, and an inexpensive machine that travels well.

I was looking at a Chromebook but I decided to spend the few extra bucks and get a genuine Windows machine.For those who do not know...This is a netbook. It does not have a CD/DVD drive. It's not supposed to. You can pretty much download anything from the internet or use USB drives/memory cards if you really need to add something. The machine seems to be well built. It is lightweight. Windows 8 seems to boot up pretty quick. Maybe 30 seconds to a minute. The specs for what it is are fine. It's pretty responsive, and quick to open/close programs. I like the fact you can upgrade the RAM. I don't see the need now, but if I find a good deal on RAM I might pull the trigger (More RAM is never a bad thing.)All that being said, if you are looking at this unit, please be advised...it is a netbook. They are inexpensive, low to medium spec computers. If you demand high speed gaming or you make your living as a graphic artist perhaps this is not the machine for you.

WinXP would have been awesome but the drivers were only for win7...I can boldly state than Win8 preloaded makes this laptop daft...Good luckI lovethe form factor/usability/performance of this laptop. I wasnt sure how it would be after my Dell i3, 8 GB laptop but this isnt bad at all....Caveat - Win8 was practically unusable - so I inserted my Win7 32 bit CD, wiped out everything, instaled win7 and after 3 hours of drivers from acer website - it was brand new (again :-). Acer website made registration easy as well as the process of getting hardware info easy - andregistration includeda $10 Skyoecredit voucher ((perhaps a christmas gift - didnt see it advertised anywhere)Love it", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "WINDOWS 8 Horrible", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "R2ISEE6RMATHM3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this system is so completely user unfriendly that I am ready to return the laptop.

So either you have a slow computer or no headphones.  On, yeah it's already very slow anyways.The worst part is the pathetic battery life.  I always leave this piece of shit plugged in.  I also have the screen set to dim and the battery life still sucks.  like 2 hours or something pathetic.So, in conclusion, the screen is bad, the mouse is bad, the battery is bad, and it's slow.
