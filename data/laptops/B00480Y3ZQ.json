{"Reviews": [{"Title": "True World Class Notebook!", "Author": "Beta Media", "ReviewID": "R3LKXL52AK07QW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This notebook is one of the most powerful laptops in the ultra portable, super compact laptop class. It's not your typical cheap notebook, it costs more then most, but it looks expensive right out of the box, and yes, it's worth every penny, because it offers a great bundle of the most popular options and very latest technologies, in one extremely small but a powerful package! Punch of a Monster in a size of a netbook! A definite show stopper! Will work for years to come with Fujitsu famous assembly quality and top of the line reliability! You will take pride in owning one. Enjoy!", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hard act to follow", "Author": "Lynn Flink", "ReviewID": "R1FS9KW9YSRIF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has been my primary machine for the past several years. I've been delaying selecting a replacement because I haven't seen one I've liked as much. I still really like it. I plan to add more memory (now that it is affordable) and refurbish it and keep using it--just no longer as the primary computer.If I could have identified which Fujitsu was the best current equivalent I would have bought it. I'm buying my first non-Fujitsu after having four of them in a row. (It hasn't arrived yet.) I hope I like it as well.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00480Y3ZQ"}}
