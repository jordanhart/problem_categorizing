{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Laptop flawed by minor issues.", "Author": "Jesse Brooks", "ReviewID": "RYIZ5TACT35NF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Performance is excellent, with no issues or hiccups trying to do intensive tasks.Sound quality from the JBL speaker system is amazing for a laptop.The Anti-glare display, even though it is a lower resolution, provides a crisp and bright image.The keyboard is very well made, with surrounding keys not moving when a key near is pushed.The touchpad is nicely made, with physical buttons for the mouse clicks.Cons:Build quality could be better/ It has a slight flex in the chassis at times.Battery life could be better, although it should not be a top priority for a laptop of this performance.Screen hinges bounce slightly, however they do not give any indication of loosening.Overall, this laptop is the best one I've ever owned. I love it! I would recommend this to anybody looking in the market for a laptop.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Great", "Author": "Joseph Morana", "ReviewID": "R1EPKTL2TBPWPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A Great buy.

The listing said it had 8GB RAM, it only had 6GB. The laptop came with the most basic, bare-bones version of Windows 8. Microsoft support could not even get the laptop to accept my anti-virus software (McAfee). It came with no user instructions, no warranty info, or recovery disks.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00A8OMTH0"}}
