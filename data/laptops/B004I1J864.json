Since then I've had to have it serviced once because of a cracked display, for which I have no idea how that happened.  That cost $600.00+.  Now the display won't work at all, even plugging in a secondary display won't work, and now the machine won't even come on.  Lesson learned, do not buy Asus, and if you do, don't buy a machine without a warranty.

I has not been without its faults however; unfortunately most of those faults lay with Asus customer service and support. Shortly after receiving this laptop I found out through my own research that a recall was being issued on it *Sandy Bridge Recall*. To make a very long story short I was never notified my Asus of the recall even though I registered this laptop the same day I received it. When I began emailing Asus with questions about the recall no one knew ANYTHING about it and I was send around to other departments several times going on over a few weeks before I got to someone that knew anything about it. At one point in my transfers I was even told by 2 separate support/tech personnel that the recall was already performed on my notebook even though my notebook was part of the first batch sold even though the S/N look-up said mine was part of the recall. I did finally end up getting it figured out and sent in and was in continual contact with one of the people overseeing the recall and was told the day it arrived in their hands that I would have a replacement sent out in a couple of days just to receive an email from someone else the following day that stock was gone and it would be 2 weeks before they would get more. After complaining several times a \"rush\" was supposedly put on my laptop just and instead of it being 2 weeks is was 12 days and it shipped ground.  Nice rush  So to sum all this up laptop is AWESOME but Asus really needs to get things figured out and maybe get rid of the dead weight and hire some people that don't make up stories. If you don't know when, how or why something is happening or how long something will take don't make up a story just tell the truth and maybe offer to find out and get back to the customer and if it is going to take a lot longer then is reasonable then offer some kind of compensation to your customer... I am 27 and it feels like no one has any pride in their work anymore! I know to some people that sounds strange coming from someone as young as me but I take pride in EVERYTHING I do. Want the world to be a better place start by taking pride in your work and be honest!  PleaseOh and another thing about this laptop Asus includes a 1 yr accidental damage warranty on it if you are like me and are afraid of destroying a $1500+ laptop buy and extended warranty though square trade.  They are AWESOME people and really stand behind their service.  The day I received my laptop and I activated my extended warranty though them *3yr accidental* I received a call from them not automated an actual person welcoming me to the service and asking if I had any questions or concerns that they could address; I have NEVER had any service provider to that.  And before I send my laptop in for service I called and asked if I needed to do anything special to transfer the warranty from my current laptop at the time to the replacement all they wanted was an email or fax from Asus documenting the exchange. Then when I received my replacement square trade called me to make sure everything went well.", "Date": "July 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "DONT PAY ATTENTION TO THE 3 STARS", "Author": "SENRISA", "ReviewID": "R11ATATK889W84", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I agree its frustrating when people write reviews on products they haven't purhased, but after reading some of the negative reviews towards ASUS and Amazon, I felt I should clear a few things up.First, most people don't realize it, but we have all been buying ASUS hardware for a long time.  It's a safe bet that about 80% of the computers on the market have some piece of hardware made by ASUS.  They have been manufacturing hardware for most name. brands for almost a decade now.  So to say ASUS crap is kind of ignorant.  They actually know what they're doing, but as most people understand, every computer is going to bug out on occasion for any numbers of reasons.Secondly, at the same time, listen to what people are saying and don't buy the G73 version since it obviously has problems.  The best way to avoid this is to pay attention to what you're ordering when you order it.  It clearly states this is the ASUS G73.  I've always had great experiences with Amazon, but granted, they should probably pull this model and not sell it.I'll be buying this laptop on Tuesday and will leave a follow up review on my experience with the laptop.

With the 8GB of DDR3 RAM(up to 16GB), two 500GB hybrid drives from Seagate, i7 proc, Nvidia graphics makes its specs nice and high for the cost of the machine especially now that it is a year later.  The only down side I have had is that my BD combo drive started to fail within 4 months and now one of my hybrid drives failed just a few days ago. I do not count these failures harshly against the system things like that happen with hardware every once in a while. I figured it gives me an opportunity and reason to upgrade them to something more my style like a SSD and a full Blue-Ray writer. I did think that the wireless card should have been a better type like one that can do both the 2.4 and 5.8 gigahertz spectrum. There are a few that Intel makes that I like however you will have to install another wireless antenna to gain the benefit. The two true CON's that I would say it has that is it comes pre-installed with a lot of extra software that I would consider bloatware (which I removed) and that support can be less than great. Overall I would say that this system is again excellent, well made and even to some extent upgradable. I give it 4 of 5 and I would have gone 5 of 5 but the minor things with the Hard drive  (to me) brought it down just a little.This system did come out during the Intel Sandy bridge chip-set problems but it has the REVISED version of the Sandy bridge chip-set so no need to worry.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fail", "Author": "Tracie \"tracieknits\"", "ReviewID": "RKMV199XJ9PP0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "One week after the warranty expired, the motherboard and dc adapter failed.

I'd gone the custom built route in the past, but often times that high level of processor/graphics power comes at the cost of a hot and noisy experience.

If you've looked at the specs, it should be obvious it is a phenomenal product on the inside plus a very desirable 1920x1080 super-bright display, extremely loud speaker system, back-lit keyboard, backward-facing exhaust vents (this was a huge bonus for me), etc.I'm still very in love with this thing because it offers all the feature and more than I was hoping I could find in a single laptop. In fact, it doesn't seem there's any other laptop on the market with equivalent specs. The speed, power, and useability make this a dream machine.All that said, I've been sorely disappointed with some persistent hardware malfunctioning. The wifi adapter very frequently drops its connection for no apparent reason whatsoever. By \"very frequently\" I mean I normally can retain a connection for up to 5-10 minutes before it disconnects for about 30 seconds then reconnects. All other devices on my LAN have no connectivity problems, so I know it's just the laptop. I also tried using the ethernet adapter to mitigate this issue, but the odd thing is the same thing happens with that. This might not be a noticeable problem to some, but I imagine it would be an annoyance to most, especially since this is a gaming notebook. (I have never done any gaming on it, however. I often use it for work which involves using persistent SSH connections to remote servers all day and night.)The other hardware problem is that the trackpad horribly malfunctions. At first it just started moving the mouse in strange places or zooming in/out unexpectedly or clicking when I'm trying to just move the cursor or by not moving at all. Then after a while, the trackpad and its buttons just stopped working altogether. I mean they were completely nonfunctional.I love the machine a lot despite the connectivity issue, and so much so that I even purchased a USB wifi adapter to use on the laptop. But those things are pretty flaky as well and once the trackpad was busted, I considered returning the thing, however I was well beyond Amazon's return policy would allow.I started an RMA with Asus via their website. I just had to provide the serial number, purchase date information, etc. and a tech support person emailed me to troubleshoot. When installing all the firmware updates he recommended didn't make a lick of difference, they had me ship it via FedEx to their repair center (on their dime, of course).I received it back under a week later with only a strange single sheet of paper inside the box. It lists a bunch of checkboxes for possible repairs they could have made and only \"Replaced LCD Monitor\" was checked. How odd. I didn't know how replacing the monitor could fix the ethernet adapter, wifi adapter, and trackpad, but I cracked the thing open and gave it a whirl. To my surprise, all seemed keen... for a little while.I was a happy camper. I had the perfect laptop I knew this bad boy could be. I left some SSH connections open as a test for over 48 hours and they never disconnected. Using the trackpad is always accurate.Now here I sit 2 months later and all the same problems have returned. I phoned their tech support line and they opened a new RMA for me and I'll be sending it back in for in-depth repairs tomorrow. I'm hoping for a better, more permanent outcome this go-'round. Will update this review with any new info I have.As an aside, I'm not sure why people have had given so many horrible reviews of Asus' tech support. I've dealt with them via email and over the phone and I've never had any problems with them. They seem to be pretty responsive to me.Oct 24, 2011 UPDATE: ===========================To update the status of my laptop, I sent it in the second time and they replaced the wifi board and the trackpad. Upon starting to use it, the wifi disconnection problem was worse than ever, dropping my connection every 2 minutes. Plus, the trackpad they put in had a broken left mouse button that made no physical click and you'd have to pound to make it execute a click.I sent it back in for the third time about a week later. I received it back from this 3rd RMA about 10 days later. This time they replaced the hard drive, wifi board, trackpad, and LCD panel. I didn't have much time to test my wifi connection because soon as I turned it on, I realized they must've put the wrong LCD panel on because I could not achieve my previous maximum resolution of 1920x1080.The very same day I received it, I spent about a few hours updating Windows and all the drivers and another hour on the phone with tech support starting my 4th RMA. I sent it out the following morning and am still waiting on getting it back for the fourth time...This just isn't right. At the very least, one tech support fellow informed that if I return it one or two more times for the same issue, they will send it back to headquarters and give me a new one... So, now I'm hoping it will continue not working for me.It's an incredible machine and it's far superior to any laptop I've ever used or owned in every regard, except for these manufacturer defects that seemingly can't be resolved.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Computer At First - THEN NOT!", "Author": "Amber Nicole Steward \"Nickiemay\"", "ReviewID": "R1X8KFSQJBLYDP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had my computer for going on 5 months now, and for the first 4 months it was amazing!!!!

Upon opening the package, I noticed that there were no recertification stickers to be found anywhere.  After finally getting the Asus support website to load, I confirmed that my laptop was indeed affected by the recall.Edit 1:  Amazon is unable to exchange the laptop (not that I'd trust them to ship a re-certified model), but offered a refund.  This requires me to pay for shipping back to them, at which time they estimate the refund will process in 10-15 business days.  Not exactly thrilled about having my money tied up so long thanks to their willingness to ship a pre-recall laptop.Before I dealt with Amazon's support, I attempted to do an expedited recall through Asus.  Asus support is by far the worst customer service experience I've ever had.  They couldn't fathom that I had formatted and performed a clean Win7 install prior to realizing the laptop was affected by the recall.  Who wouldn't want their notoriously bad software, right?  The CSR talked down to me while possessing the trouble shooting skills of an infant.  They couldn't even figure out how to create a case number to begin processing the recall.
