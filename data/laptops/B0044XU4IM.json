{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very fast, but frequently crashes", "Author": "Nicholas Bilyk", "ReviewID": "R15F4EVU71RPJ7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Now that I've had this computer for a few months, I'd like to modify my review.  This computer has randomly shut down about 10 times now, a dozen blue screens of death related to USB 3.  I'm sure these are either hardware or driver related and rescind my recommendation for this machine.____________________________This is a very fast laptop.  I'm a computer programmer that needs a very fast machine for pretty much everything I do, and this laptop is awesome.This machine as it is listed has great upgraded options, like the best resolution screen, blu-ray, extra battery, and extra RAM, however, the hard drive it comes with is very slow.  This laptop does have a 2nd hard drive bay and I bought the 225$ 128GB Kingston SSD, made it my primary drive, then made the original drive my secondary drive.  To do this was no small task, but here's the steps to take:Warning: I have no idea if this does or does not void your warranty, I can't find a clear answer to that.1. Order this laptop2. Order an SSD ($225-$250 for 128GB, or $360-$400 for 160GB)3. Order a hard drive caddy and cable kit.  HP sells it for 91$ after taxes and shipping, but you can get it for 41$ from newmodeus.com.  [...]And by the way HP, I think that it's awful that the laptop didn't come with this in the first place.  $41 for just a 3\" cable is robbery and the $91 that you charge is two robberies and a beating.4. If you get a SATA hard drive enclosure, things will be easier because you can connect the drives to the eSata port.  Otherwise you will need to install the ssd to the 2nd hard drive bay, do the clone, then switch them so the SSD is in the first bay. Note: HP does NOT give you the windows 7 installation DVD, so the first thing you should do is make recovery DVDs through their utility.  But also know that you can't use these DVDs to set up a new drive because they won't create the special boot partition HP uses.  (I learned this the hard way)5. Resize the original drive's partitions so they are altogether small enough to fit on the new drive. (And be sure to move them so the unpartitioned space is at the end) Easeus partition manager is by far the easiest way to do this, and you will need its boot cd it makes later, so I'd suggest buying the pro version and save yourself a headache or two.6. Use either clonezilla (free) or Easeus partition manager pro ($40) to create a boot disk and clone the old drive to the new one.  I used clonezilla, but Easeus is a lot easier.7. After confirming the new drive works and is in bay 1, you'll notice the old drive is \"Offline\", meaning Windows can't use it.  You will need to delete all of its partitions, create a primary partition and format it with NTFS in order to make it work.  Use the Easeus professional boot disk to do this.  Then when you boot Windows, go to disk management, right click the drive and select \"Online\" to make it Online, whatever that means.Also note that the back panel to change the hard drives on this laptop was (at least for me) incredibly difficult to remove.  I felt like I was surely going to break it with the force it took to pry it off.  I've had several laptops in the past, and this one is the first one that I've had any difficulty replacing the hard drive.  It's also the first one I've had with two hard drive bays.So it's definitely a lot of work to get a faster hard drive in there and may be more trouble than it's worth, but in my opinion, buying a high-end laptop at this time without a solid state drive is foolish.  So either find a different laptop that has an SSD, order this laptop customized from hp.com (considerably more expensive) to include an SSD, or stepping down to a more economy line laptop would all be better options than not having one.GamingDid I mention that this laptop is good for gaming?  The 1GB ATI Mobility 5850 is one of the fastest mobile graphics cards at the time of this review.  If you want a faster gaming machine, you either have to spend over $3000 for a better gaming laptop, or get a desktop.  This graphics card puts this machine on par for gaming with modern mid-range desktops, which is saying a lot for a laptop.  It also allows you to have up to 3 external monitors. (Display port, VGA, and HDMI). However, I do have a problem with League of Legends crashing when using a 1920x1280 monitor through the display port.  That is likely just the game, but who knows.  It works fine with the VGA port.Beats AudioThe Beats audio does not live up to the hype.  I find the built in speakers to be rather crummy in my opinion.  Previous reviews say \"Good, for a laptop\".  I would add,  \"very slightly above average laptop speakers\".  The sound card is good, it sounds great with external bose speakers or headphones, but the laptop speakers suck.  In fact, it took a lot of configuring to get them to not sound completely broken.ScreenThe display is better than any other laptop I've seen.  It's at least equal to high-end macbook pros.  It looks perfect from any angle, has great resolution, and is attached by sturdy metal hinges.Keyboard and mouseThe keyboard is awesome, but I hate the touchpad.  I love how it's the back-lit, island style keyboard.  The numpad is great to have, the keys are all in the right spot and size.  I'm always amazed at how few laptops or even external keyboards get it right.The touchpad, on the other hand, is awful.  I don't think I'll ever get used to it.  I can't even drag things with it.  I don't know if I'm just \"doing it wrong\", but it is literally impossible to use.  I don't like touchpads in general, I prefer Lenovo button mice, but this one is particularly terrible.  I can overlook this huge flaw in a laptop by always using an external mouse.ConnectionsAwesome, Mini display port, hdmi, vga, eSata, usb 3, blu-tooth, wireless n, gigabit ethernet.  All awesome.  One thing though, instead of a microphone jack, it's a \"headset\" jack?  I can't seem to use it as a microphone port either.  This confuses me..Power SupplyIt's huge. But what do you expect? Big computer, big power supply.HD Camera and microphoneWorks fine, good for my uses, but not as good as I hoped it would be.  The built in microphone sounds great.SoftwareHP didn't go overboard with pre-installed software like it did with the last HP I bought, and Windows 7 is great.  The partitioning of the drives is weird and the HP recovery software isn't very good.  It doesn't come with windows disks, so again, be sure to immediately create the recovery disks.OtherThis laptop has no docking station options.  This alone was almost reason enough to go with Dell or Lenovo, but neither of those were as good for gaming at the same price, nor did they match up in many other areas.Bottom line, this is a power hungry, fast, big laptop.  A great desktop replacement, but doesn't have the mobility or battery life as some people might like.I hope this helps people, and doesn't utterly confuse everyone.Targus XL Backpack Designed for 17 Inch Notebooks TXL617 (Black with Blue Accents)Kingston SSDNow V100 128GB SATA II 3GB/s 2.5 Inch Solid State Drive SV100S2/128GZ", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Flawless!", "Author": "Vasper \"Vasper\"", "ReviewID": "R2578Y97KMFDIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this for my wife and it arrived on time and build quality was flawless.

Chambers \"Small Business Owner\"", "ReviewID": "R3GW4J0CKYR6ZN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this machine from Amazon several months ago.  At first, it was truly a portable office for me.  I'm on the road most of the time and the 1181NR more than met my needs.  I easily added a second 750 GB hard drive and upgraded the memory to 8 GB ... both I did myself without issue.As for the BUT ... the unit has always run warmer than any other laptop I've owned, but it wasn't an issue until about a month ago.  At that time it started getting so warm my left hand would go numb (I touch type and rest my wrist/hands on the wrist pad when not actively typing).  Ultimately, the unit started shutting itself down from overheating.  I would get a message when rebooting telling me it shut down to protect itself.  About the same time, the noise from the fan and heat became so great, I contacted HP.  That's when the real fun began.  Twice, I called and wound up speaking to someone in Asia.  When I couldn't understand them, they disconnected me.  After 4 calls, I was able to reach someone who arranged to have the unit picked up and repaired.  As the unit is still under warranty, everything was done through FedEx at their expense.  Unfortunately, instead of their promised turnaround time, it was well over 2 weeks before I got the laptop back.  On it's return, it was worse than ever ... temps have been as high as 137 deg F.  Even worse, HP left almost 2 GB of testing software (bootleg??) on my desktop.  The software is labeled 3Dmk06 and OCCTPT 3.1.0.At my company, we have historically preferred HP equipment.  In my office alone, I have an HP desktop, the above HP laptop, an HP LaserJet AIO, and an HP Color LaserJet.  Our corporate server is also an HP machine.  I had a similar problem with tech support on one of the printers a long time ago, but never anything like this.At this point, the 1181NR laptop is on its way back to HP for a second repair.

Tiangco", "ReviewID": "R2JEJZL9UAUO2V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This notebook powers though everything I've thrown at it. Great for games, editing video, surfing the net, and getting work done. Everything loads up fast and runs smooth. Display is sharp and intense. You may have to dial it down a bit to make it comfortable on the eyes. Speakers sound nice with good stereo imaging, but bass is lacking. You'll want to hook up to external speakers for better results.Touch pad is somewhat annoyingly sensitive, making typing without interference a bit challenging. Even more annoying, it defaults on every time you power up or resume from standby. I wish it had a dedicated button that remembers you turned it off like the older HP notebooks, but instead it has a special corner on the pad you have to double tap to toggle it on or off. I like to use a regular optical mouse and the Logitech MX518 is a great match.Function keys are truly functional with icons emphasized over \"F#\" designations, and they come already mapped to stuff like volume, screen brightness, net browser, and keyboard backlight. Built-in cam takes decent photos and videos even in low light. Program that runs the cam is easy to operate and its icon is right on the taskbar for quick access. 4 USB ports and one is 3.0 capable. When paired to a USB 3.0 external drive, I was able to archive 9 GB of data in 6.5 min (timed with stopwatch). Try that with USB 2.0 and you might as well take an extended lunch break.Solid chassis construction. Textured carbon finish and glowing HP logo on lid will make you feel extra special. There is some palpable heat that builds up under your left hand, but it's not too bad and actually feels nice in a cold room.

Its only been 15 days. also saw on Amazon just days after receiving mine theat this laptop was not being sold through Amazon anymore (which is where I got mine) until they resolved some issues that people were having with it. Seems it was just in their stock but were still selling it through another vendor. When I called to look into this they (Amazon) would not give me a straight answer. Anyone have any ideas what the issue was with Amazons stock? I bought 2 Other HP Laptops through Costco.com And havent had ANY issues to date. Got 1 for a month the other about 2.

Since, for most people, buying a laptop is expensive, and hopefully not something that'll happen more than about once every few years, its important to get it right - which is why I wish I'd had someone warn me off this one.Basically, whatever merits the laptop might have are undone by two basic, key flaws:- it crashes. I haven't had a laptop crash since the 90s and dial-up, but I'm back in that world now; music stops, cursor freezes, no possibility of just shutting down whatever might have glitched.- it overheats. It doesn't just get hot - I could live with that, and knew to expect that - but it will shut down, without ANY warning, and you have to restart it once its cooled. I've lost so much time and work from this; admittedly, it worked ok for the first 9 months with a cooler but a) even that didn't stop it shutting down eventually and b) you shouldn't have to have a cooler just so it works.And the thing is, these are inherant in the machine, they're not faults, so its not as it it can be repaired. It shouldn't be sold like this, but mine was.I've given it 2 stars, partly becuase of its few merits - speed, screen quality, nice keypad, design etc - but mainly so this review isn't ignored as being from an irate crank, but hopefully helps someone make a better informed decision than I did.", "Date": "May 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fine piece of machine", "Author": "Helvin J.

While not perfect by any means, it delivers in many ways.Aesthetics: 8.5/10This is a good looking PC, I wouldn't say it's better looking than a MacBook Pro, but it's at the top of PCs. The design boasts laser-etched magnesium for the casing, but something is left to be desired. It's very, very plain looking, for better or worse. The etchings are just of dots and little squares, making an illusion of a design. If you aren't paying attention, it's hard to notice. The black keyboard against the silverish casing is very Apple, but it works well together. The entire display has a glossy glass piece over it, and makes the overall look very attractive. But the outward case is very plain and simplistic, it has that modern design to it but it seems like they take it too far.Design: 6/10This is the major pitfall. While the computer is fairly thin and looks good, the aesthetics negatively affects the computer. The HP Envy 17 is a powerhouse, with a great graphics card and processor, but with power comes heat. From what I can tell, there's only one vent on this machine, on the bottom of the upper right section of the keyboard. And that vent gets hot. Very hot. Playing a game or watching HD movies can make the machine incredibly hot to the touch, in the upper right section. And since it's made of metal, the heat makes the metal hot and it travels over almost the entire machine. A laptop cooler is almost a necessity for this beast. Covering the vent for even a minutes results in overheating. And even the glass piece over the display isn't sealed, so dust can easily get in that thing. The keyboard may look like a MacBook keyboard, but it is not spill-proof.Hardware: 9.5/10For a laptop, the power it can give is very good. With an i7 processor and ATI Radeon 5850 graphics, this beast can easily play the most modern of games. It has no trouble playing 1080p movies from a Blu-Ray, etc. It boots up fairly quickly, and even when a lot of processes are running, it never hiccups. But again, when processing a lot of data, it gets super hot. But this computer can handle a lot of processing very quickly. This model includes a Blu-ray player that can also read DVDs, which compliments the 1920x1080 resolution on the 17.3'' screen.Audio: 8/10The built-in speakers are sub-par at best, but with Beats audio and the soundcard it has, diverting sound to a good stereo system or pair of headphones make them sound amazing.Ports: 9/10There are a slew of connectivity ports on the HP Envy 17, which include a VGA, gigabit Ethernet port, HDMI, the elusive miniDisplay port, 3 USB 2.0 ports, a 5-in-1 card reader, headphone and headset jack, and even a USB 3.0 port. I just wish it had a couple more USB 2.0 ports, my old laptop had 5 which I all used. But this machines give you many options.Keyboard and Trackpad: 9/10In my eyes, the keyboard and trackpad are the simple most important things on any laptop. It's how you navigate and input data into the machine all the time, so it needs be good. I love the keyboard, the MacBook design is very nice and makes typing very clear and easy. I have big hands, so having the keys a little spaced out is very good. The trackpad is big, responsive, and feels pretty good but really doesn't deliver on multi-touch gestures. Like using two fingers to scroll down a page barely ever responds. Multi-touch gestures aren't a huge deal to me, but it can be annoying at times. If you rely on multi-touch gestures on your last laptop, don't get this, they just do not work.Overall: 8.5/10For the cost, it gives you some very good hardware and software, but it's far from perfect. If you're looking for a premium 17'' PC, this is a very good choice, just remember the flaws it has and you this can be a great laptop. The HP Envy 17 could easily be one of the best PC laptops out there on the market. Models differ, but the overall design is about the same.

Reach around the back of the screen and feel the aluminum on the lid-amazingly FLIMSY and feels like a cardboard cover.

It shut down 90% into the upgrade.Don't laugh, but I then had to strategically place a flat pack of antifreeze underneath the laptop all the while being careful to avoid the vent holes. Only then was I able to proceed with the upgrade.Surprisingly enough the second attempt at the upgrade went like a breeze, but I think that had more to do with the fact that I recently installed a Samsung 830 SSD (256GB) which makes things a bit more zippy.After the Windows 8 Pro upgrade straight off I had a problem with the Intel Rapid Storage Technology not coming online and performance issues with Microsoft's Broadcom 802.11n driver.The old version of Intel Rapid Storage Technology was not getting online quick enough and that was causing everything to freeze up so I had to updated it to Version 11.6.0.1030 (file named iata_enu.exe) dated 09/13/2012. I think it's a 32 bit version rather than a 64 bit version but it worked. The Windows 8 advisor was silent on this matter!Although I can't post links here please try the following HP downloads as the some of the ones listed on the HP-1181NR page are not compatible with Windows 8 Pro:The Broadcom 802.11n driver issue was fixed by installing the sp48591.exe from HP;If you're having trouble installing the Beats interface try downloading sp5796\u200b6.exe for the IDT driver; andFor bluray try HP sp53029.exe which is basically CyberLink PowerDVD 10 software. Make sure you turn AutoPlay on by selecting the Use AutoPlay for all media and devices check box.

Both HP and Microsoft got it right, this time.The screen is gorgeous, back-lit keyboard pleasant to use, and the core i7 processor, 6 gig of RAM, and 640 gig HD give this machine plenty of power. I work in Network Support for a large corporation, and do high-end 3D graphics for fun. This machine handles any app I throw at it without a hiccup, and SPEEDILY. In fact Bryce 7, Truespace 7.6, and ZBrush 4 run better on this machine than they do on my WIN XP 64-bit, full tower work-station which has more RAM, storage, and processing power!Setup is easy to configure the way you want, once you get a handle on some of the HP and Microsoft Update features (I turned most of them off, being a hands-on, \"when I want it\" kind of guy). HP support proved to be very good, even for minor \"how do I\" questions.Minor caveats--processor runs HOT, which is to be expected, so plan on using a notebook cooler. The power-brick is a little cumbersome, as the cord that connects wall-socket and brick likes to come loose from the brick. The positioning and use of a straight-in power connector (as opposed to a 90-degree, flat-lying plug) is a little awkward. The remaining connectors are well-placed. If you have more than 3 USB devices to connect, consider using a powered hub.Fit and finish are excellent. \"Envy\" is a good name for this machine. They even give you an auxiliary battery, which I will test the next time I have to fly to the East Coast.The Beats Audio, while nothing special through the laptop speakers, shines with a good set of headphones, thanks to a built-in software EQ.Would be nice to see an option for a 128-gig (or larger) SSD on this machine, although it is possible, with a little extra work, to install your own SSD in the spare bay and set it up to be your boot drive.Overall, a good desk-top replacement or road machine (it's HEAVY, but a good wheeled bag will fix that).Worth every penny!", "Date": "April 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "A lemon[...]", "Author": "M.

Honestly they sounded like a blown speaker would sound however I never turned up the volume high enough for that to happen. I called HP customer service and after several transfers I got to a guy who spoke English as his first language which I was pleased with but he seemed flustered and uncertain. He was searching for answers but did not know what he was doing and I gave up on that. I did some web searches and found a bulletin board where others complained of the same issues. Not so uncommon I guess... Anyway after one incident with the speakers where the audio on a video came on, the screen went blank and crashed to a blue screen. Later that day the computer crashed again. I have a hunch that the problems started with all the updates that the computer does within the first day or so. A couple of updates didn't seem to go so well. Needless to say I sent this laptop back which strangely was at my expense to the tune of over [...] because amazon requires the item to be insured.

The right side of the touch pad is flush. It may be because of the pad but I've also found that my hand lays on the pad and when I use the touch pad as a mouse, it thinks I have two fingers on the pad and zooms in and out when I am trying to navigate.I often use the F5 key to refresh a webpage.  The Envy requires holding the fn key and the F5 to refresh the call.  The really slowed me down.I found the keys did not aways \"take\" my keystroke causing me to type more than once.The PC crashed to a blue DOS screen showing a hardware error twice.  It was still new, and I had only installed Office 2010.The built in video was not as high of resolution as I expected for a high end laptop like this.It is very warm outputting to the left side of the laptop.  I didn't find it to be too bad thought. This model came with an extra large batter that lifted the bottom of the laptop up off the table or... - that quickly became my default battery since I didn't want it to overheat.I've had it for less than 30 days and am trying to return it rather than repair it (I would have purchased at a discount if I wanted a refurbished model within 2 weeks.)  HP seemed to be happy to transfer my 3 year HP extended care package to another laptop so that is good.I wasn't that crazy about not having separate touch pad buttons like most other laptops had.  This also caused me problems occasionally when I went to click on the button, the mouse also moved and that meant I didn't click at all.Because I've sunk the funds into the HP care pack, I have to purchase another HP to transfer the care pack so I'm kind of stuck.  I recommend holding off on purchasing the extended care until you know this laptop will work for you.  I didn't notice the sound being that much better even though there are tiny woofers in the bottom of the laptop.
