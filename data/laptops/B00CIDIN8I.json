It seems a little more sturdy than the usual black plastic cases, I guess that's why it's recommended for travel or heavy business use.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP Laptop", "Author": "Scott Cordry", "ReviewID": "R13N1DDRW8TNI4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a solid business laptop which comes ready for a docking station and Windows 7.

While HP went to great lengths to make this unit look swanky & modern, it isn't reliable or durable. The keys stick. It locks up regularly, and does nothing very well. Perhaps if I did not also have a MacBook Air to compare it to, I might like it more, but I do so I don't. I would not recommend this laptop. It screams \"cheap\" in it's functions. The first time you open the DVD drive tray, you'll gasp that it didn't just fall off.
