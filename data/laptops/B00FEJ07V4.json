{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best sub $500 Laptop on the Market", "Author": "P. knight \"Speed expert\"", "ReviewID": "R3BEMDX7VFKJ5C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dec 7, 2013: Just received the S500 from this webpage and it does in fact, have a caching SSD, so you can be confident that it will be a very fast machine.......................................................Allow me to clarify that I wouldn't own this big a laptop for myself. I have the 12 inch Vivobook and it's just perfect for me.This one is for a friend who needs a full size laptop.So let's get to it.This machine is blistering fast. I have a Samsung 840 SSD in my own Vivobook and this 16 incher matches it. They both have the same processor and same amount of ram. The only difference is that the 16 incher uses a caching SSD which would make any computer a lot faster, but I didn't expect it to be as fast as my own.Anyhow, if you like fast machines, this one may be for you.The build is absolutely beautiful and super solid.I have two Asus low end plastic laptops here and the keyboard quality difference between the S500 and those bargain machines, is huge.The touchscreen is nothing less than perfect.If you're one of these people who jumped on the \"I hate Windows 8\" bandwagon, then you need not read any further.Win 8's touch interface far surpassed my expectations. I had hopes that it would at least be as good as iOS (iPads) or Android, and to my surprise, it blows them away.It is 10 times as intuitive and way more versatile.As an example, try to kill a process running in the background on Android or iOS. It's a whole rigamaroll and you need a special app to do it.In Win 8, you swipe from the top bezel to the bottom and the app is gone and no longer running.The split screen options are truly fantastic.On my own Vivobook I have the new 8.1 upgrade that has a lot more touch features than the original Win 8.One of the things that was a pleasant surprise was while I was chatting on Skype and was given a link to look at a product online. When I clicked on it, the chat box immediately reduced down to approx. 1/3 the screen while the website that I clicked on, was open and taking up the rest of the screen.That may not sound that impressive to you, but it illustrates how far MSC went to make this a superior touch interface.Please be aware that there are not as many free games in the MSC store yet, so if you love gaming. perhaps an Android or iPad will suit you better.For those who need a real laptop and would also love to have the fun of a touchscreen, these Vivobooks are impossible to beat.To be sure that the 12 incher suited me best, I bought the 14 incher too and I found it a wee bit too big. Later on, the 13 incher came out and I bought that one too, and it also was a bit too big.Naturally, I feel the same way about the 16 incher. If you want to use the touch interface most of the time, the S500 is too big.The 12, 13 and 14 inchers are good, but the only one that is totally comfortable on one's lap and that can easily be handled with one hand, is the 12 inch model (X202e).For those who cannot decide what size they would like, I suggest going to a store to look at the sizes, even if it's a different brand or not even a touch model. It's only to establish the size of the machine that would best suit you.The S500 has USB3, HDMI an SD card reader and a decent webcam. It also has nice sound, way way better than any of the smaller models. It's actually good enough to sit back and listen to.If you didn't already know, Asus manufactures it's own machines and it shows. HP, Dell, Lenovo, Sony, Toshiba, Acer, do NOT build their own. They are manufactured to spec by another company.Those of us who are in the biz (I repair and tweak computers) refer to Asus as the Rolls Royce of the industry.The s500 looks slick and it performs beyond its price range and is beautifully built with a brushed aluminum surface(the black top is a fingerprint magnet but the silver interior is not).There isn't another laptop in this price range that can compete with the S500.That being said, it would be wise to assure that you like the size, before purchasing.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "She likes it; really, really likes it!", "Author": "Tom T", "ReviewID": "R10EW83U9OAYKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a Mac user since \u201985 and a current MacBook Pro owner, I have to agree with \u201cSpeed expert\u201d that this is a good looking machine and is super solid. It definitely looks and feels a lot more expensive than what I paid for it during the Amazon BF lightening sale. I wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed if any of my Mac friends saw me using it. There\u2019s nothing about the outer appearance or when you open the lid that yells \u201cCheap.\u201dNo, I haven\u2019t switched over to the Dark Side. I got this for my wife, who happens to be computer semi-literate. I mean that in a positive way. She\u2019s avoided computers for years, but has finally decided to at least give them a try.I thought she might like a tablet, but after sampling various tablets of various sizes and brands belonging to friends, relatives and store displays, none appealed to her. Even tho most are several pounds heavier than a tablet, she wanted a laptop, and the bigger the better.It seemed the obvious choice for her would be a MacBook, but when working with mine, she would get very frustrated with the pointing, clicking, selecting, etc.Then it occurred to me she had absolutely no problem when using a touchscreen for banking and at other businesses that provide touchscreens for customers to make various selections. With that in mind, and after reading Speed Expert\u2019s comments, I decided this ASUS would fill the bill.Voil\u00e0! Windows 8.1 and a touchscreen laptop turned out to be perfect for her. With very little coaching, my wife was able to navigate around the screen and on the internet. She still occasionally needs to use the keyboard and trackpad to do some typing, pointing, clicking and selecting, but at least she\u2019s definitely enjoying the overall experience.Since getting this, she hasn\u2019t asked to borrow my Mac, but I have occasionally asked if I could borrow her ASUS :)As the home tech guy, I was the one who initially pressed the Start button and got everything set up, including getting linked with the home network and various peripherals like the scanner and printer, installing software updates plus the web browser and the email client she is familiar with, and stuff like that. No problems, no crashes, very intuitive. Very Mac-like. In one way, better: I really like the touchscreen concept on a laptop.One feature that comes in handy when working on a laptop in a low-light area is a lighted keyboard. This model does not have a lighted keyboard. A big plus in the appearance of this ASUS is the black brushed aluminum lid. Very classy, but it picks up even the slightest amount of oil that you might have on your hands, so occasional cleaning is required to keep it looking classy rather than messy.I don\u2019t know if this is just an ASUS thing or if I\u2019m out of touch, but the end of the electric cord that plugs into the power converter/battery charger is what I would call non-standard. For at least the past couple of decades, it seems power cords for PC\u2019s, monitors, and various stand-alone peripherals all had the same universal design. In case you arrived somewhere and realized you forgot a power cord for a computer or peripheral, you could easily buy or borrow a cord for temporary use. For this ASUS laptop, the end of the power cord that plugs into the battery charger has an entirely different shape from what is, or at least has been, the universal design. So it\u2019s definitely one thing not to leave behind when going on a trip.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Same cost--lower quality", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R30YIOX8GO0LYM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This Vivobook S500CA is the second Asus which I have owned.  I purchased my other in 2010 and paid about the same amount of money for it.  As with most things, the quality seems to be diminishing, specifically, the keyboard.  Asus appears to have tried to make a buck by producing a lower cost keyboard than they they did previously.  The keys on this keyboard are almost identical in looks but do not perform at all like the earlier model.  The biggest problem is the space bar which frequently does not register.  I cannot get through a normal paragraph without having to back up and correct the missing space.  I've had it happen twice so far while writing this review.  All the keys seem stiff and do not give me the positive indication of being pressed that my original Asus did.  Oops, there's another mis-hit!  I find typing on this computer a frustrating experience and am considering returning the computer.  One other minor issue I have with the computer is the lack of a second headphone jack--again, seems to be a way Asus can save money.  Every time I plug headphones into the computer I have to answer two questions regarding what type of device I'm plugging in.  It would be nice if I could set a default since I never plug in a mic.  I do like the sleekness and the low weight of the computer.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Asus provides Window 8 TouchScreen on a Budget--Exceeds my Expectations", "Author": "Craig Anderson", "ReviewID": "R1VTE6VVEI9U6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "An amazing value!  I bought refurbished for $389.  I added 8GB Crucial DDR3 RAM memory ($71) for total 12 GB RAM.  With 500 GB hardrive and 20 GB SSD, this is an amazing value for me.  I needed it for new consulting business and am very happy with this machine--I mostly need MS Office apps and browsers for internet access, so the i3 processor is not an issue for me.  I have not yet encountered a problem where I wished for a faster processor yet.A bonus for me--not a great selling point--is it has a VGA port in addition to HDMI ports.  I use it to connect to flat screen HP ZR24w monitor which has a free VGA input, so can use two screens for optimal efficiency.I had read many reports of issues with ASUS notebook space bar and touch pad, so was wary and on guard.  Early on I had some issues with the touchpad turning OFF, which I now believe to be a software control issue.  I found that I can toggle the touchpad back ON when this occurs to restore normal touchpad operation.  Have not had that issue reoccur in last several weeks.  Touch pad and touch screen are actually both very sensitive and work well. No issues with space bar or any other keys.I have not used optical drive for years except to rip music CDs, so didn't expect to miss the optical drive.  In fact, one application requiring install from CD, I installed from another Win 8 machine by sharing the optical drive.  Worked like a charm.This ASUS is thin, lightweight, and the large screen makes reading easy.  I love the touch screen and use it as often in desktop mode as I do in modern apps mode.  I'm an avid iPad user so the touch screen makes all the difference for the Windows 8 experience (my desktop does not have touch screen).Time will tell how durable the machine is, so far so good for one month.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great deal", "Author": "MikeRichmond", "ReviewID": "R36TG0OQ1WZKAT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After reading mixed reviews I pulled the trigger on this reasonable priced ultrabook, and I was pleased in every way. I did add an extra stick of memory bringing it to 8 gigs total.

So I got a good deal. The laptop itself is sleek. However it is really not an \"Ultrabook\" as it is close to 5 lbs. Therefore it is not light despite its sleek profile. However I do not mind carrying it in my backpack. Also the battery life is average. I get about 2.5 hours out of it. Processor and RAM are sufficient, but not amazing. For the money I paid they are good.Touch screen works well, but sometimes does not work after the computer sleeps. The solution is to put the PC back into sleep and awake it. This appears to restart the touch screen driver. Computer originally came with Window 8.0. For best use, you will need to get the free upgrade to Windows 8.1. The dedicated numeric keyboard is also nice. Be aware that the laptop does NOT have an optical drive. I just bought a cheap external drive for the rare instances I need to run a CD. Overall it is a solid laptop. In the future, I'd like a smaller laptop though.", "Date": "March 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for price...But beware...NO BLUETOOTH, Up-gradable ??????", "Author": "innovator1", "ReviewID": "R3H7N80CF646LX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When I saw this Laptop on Amazon, i did the research but was only finding information online for the models that have the corei 7 Specs. Comparing the specs with the information Amazon provided, the only difference was the processors and the memory. I really wanted Bluetooth because i own a pair of Bluetooth headphones which i wanted to use with a laptop. Sadly when I got this system, it has no Bluetooth as stated on Amazon. The price was just right and for the specs (including Touch Screen) I don't think it was a bad deal.Please note, this is not a full blown \"ULTRABOOK\". I would refer to it as a beginners \"ULTRABOOK\", but for the price, you cant go wrong.All in all it does what it was made to do without any hiccups. Setup was quick and easy because I am very familiar with Windows 8. I do believe they should have loaded it with Windows 8.1 to save me the time of doing so, but the upgrade was painless. Just make sure that all your updated were installed.The 4GB of ram is adequate, but i wanted to upgrade to 8GB of ram. I did a hardware scan with the scan tool from Crucial and the results showed that I can add the 8Gb of ram, which is the max memory this unit can hold. So I went down to my local computer store to purchase the 8Gb ram module. I was telling the technician at the store that I have this Asus laptop and i wanted to upgrade the ram, he told me he has the same model (which he showed me) and that if I add the 8Gb of ram, my unit would bump up to 12Gb. The 4GB the system comes with is built on to the board, so you cant remove it, but you can add a maximum of 8GB to the empty slot, thus the unit will have 12Gb of ram. (his own runs on 12GB)I purchased the r.a.m, but when I got home, I decided to research how much ram the model works with before I install in my system. Amazon specs for this unit says max 8GB, but does not specify in the empty slot. I decided to contact ASUS customer service, who informed me that this model is not up-gradable, and if I pull the cover, I will void my warranty. They told me that all the ultrabooks/laptops that have battery sealed in are not up-gradable and should not be modified.My question is, why is there an empty slot where I can add a memory module? I did the the technicians system run with 12GB of ram, but i am skeptical.I like this system and would recommend it. My only gripe is that ASUS and Amazon needs to state the true specs of this model and what simple upgrades can be done", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not great, but not bad", "Author": "Bryan", "ReviewID": "R10HSB5KBC9MQH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:Touchscreen makes Windows 8 easier to navigate.Slim, good looking, and screen is very high resolution.Quiet and pretty power efficient (I get around 3-4 hours without a charger)Fast start up speed (Mine takes around 15 seconds to boot up)Cons:Not a very fast processing speed; I get a lot of frozen screens on light internet browsing (facebook, youtube, etc.).Mine came with a faulty number pad, although this was fixed with a quick free-shipping return to the manufacturer.Not sure if this is just me, but the space bar is not as sensitive as I'm used to, so I really gotta push it down in order for it to register.Overall:Good computer for word processing and extremely light internet browsing while away from the home computer.  For the price, it's not a bad piece of equipment.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Basic but Sleek Computer That Should Suit Many People's Needs", "Author": "ivan sanchez", "ReviewID": "R3PYWJXL287EKK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got the 15.6 inch Touchscreen with 4gb of RAM.Design5lbs fits densely into a thin long frame, it's heay enough to feel it inside my bag but light on the shoulders. The keyboard is really sleek and is easy to type on although some buttons are smaller than what I am used to. The  pad is very responsive, but I have found the \"hidden\" left/right buttons a bit hard to work with. Overall, they did a great job of making this computer look and feel pretty.PerformanceIf you're like me you like to multi-task on your computer. This computer was able to handle watching youtube videos, downloading and executing an installation of a basic program, while I had itunes open without trouble. Although, at 4gb of RAM I doubt I'd be able to do anything heavy like video editing but that's not my forte so this computer's middle of the road capabilities suits me fine. Speakers are fine, they have this \"SonicMaster\" technology which spreads the sound out throughout the room a bit, by setting itunes' equalizer on \"rock\" and lowering the pre-amp it sounds clean and there's no distortion even at loud volumes--these are just laptop speakers though so don't expect bose sound or anything. The \"two-second\" instant-on is actually about 4 seconds :/ come on.Biggest UpsideThe price! For what I paid (About 400) this computer has several things going for it, it is sleek, light, and relatively powerful especially for your average work and play. I want to take this thing everywhere with me. It also comes with both a mini-VGA port and HDMI port.Biggest DownsideThe resolution, I was able to get used to it but if that's important to you you should reconsider getting this--the screen is not \"crisp\"; I connect my laptop to my hd TV when viewing films anyway. You may also want to consider: Do I want a 13 or 15 inch? Is more RAM needed? Do I mind not having backlit keyboard?

Bad product, worse service", "Author": "Jose Augusto Bianchini", "ReviewID": "R113APZBXHMQTO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "First of all, sorry for my English, it's not my mother language.On October 31, 2013, I bought an Asus VivoBook S500CA in Adorama Store, NY, during my vacation. Back to my hometown, in Brazil, after few months of use, some problems: instability with wireless system, unexpected shutdown, loss of performance, noise in sound system, damaged touchpad. On January 14, I made my first contact with Asus Customer Service. The first answer suggested me to contact international service because my product was bought in US an I could not ask for warranty in Brazil. After a few complaints in specialized websites, they accepted to receive my Vivobook for warranty repair.On February 22, I received a message saying that my notebook had been sent back to me, but no tracknumber was sent. On February 25, I received another message from Asus telling me that there were a problem during repair or delivery and they were going to make a refund to me. Considering I had a prior message telling me that product had been sent, I understood that my notebook had a problem during delivery and was lost. So, at first, I accepted to receive a refund. But, Asus is offering a refund less than the amount paid, because they are not considering the taxes I paid after. Also, the document they sent to me is saying that the computer is in possession of the company and that I asked for the refund. That is not true! They didn't give me the option of receiving a new model of the same product. After my complaints, I was informed they don't have the same model (of a new product highlighted in Asus website) or similar to offer.I'm very disappointed with Asus products and Customer Service. When I bought it, I considered it was a good choice, because they have a Customer Service in Brazil and it was highly recommended at the store. Now, I don't have a notebook for more than 2 months and I'm not sure if I'll receive the money back. In a Brazilian website for complaints, I can see I'm not the only one with the same kind of problem.So, I'm here to let you know what kind of problem you can get if you buy (please don't do it!) an Asus.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FEJ07V4"}}
