{"Reviews": [{"Title": "And on the third day... the touchpad got me! (touchpad fixed)", "Author": "geekinma", "ReviewID": "R1BW224V9NF80Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for about 3 days now. I had been wanting the zenbook since the original UX31E had come out, but held back after the reviews about the keyboard and the touchpad.The new display on the ux31a was an instant sell. Having used nothing but high resolution laptops, i had hung on to my trusty HP 6820p for 4+ years.The reviews for UX31 are mostly on the mark, but strangely somehow still fail to point the one \"true\" issue.Now moving on to something more useful..1) The display is to die for. I spent an hour with the retina mac pro, while i didn't see both the screens side by side. I'm ecstatic that ASUS is finally pushing laptops to move up from the resolution backsliding going on for the last 5 years. You will not miss the retina display on a mac with this. Half the price is just a bonus.2) It is _light_.3) The biggest showstopper is the touchpad out of the box. Yes, i'm referring to the touchpad on ux31, not the older ux31e. Multi touch etc. etc. works well. (have two macs at home for comparison). The thing that just about ruins this little gem is the horrendous behavior of the touchpad when your palm brushes it during typing. There is no way you can really avoid this, and it is impossible to do any typing without the cursor moving and the tap to touch causing irritating behavior. (like prematurely sending an email, closing the email, clicking a background app into focus). How this went past anyone in any QA dept. is beyond me. It's that bad, just typing a 2 line sentence is near impossible. This was entirely preventable with just a bit more diligence by ASUS. This one problem is bad enough to warrant a return if it weren't the fix that later became available.I upgraded the drivers to the THEN latest on the ux31a page on asus support. They didn't work any better. Update: ASUS has finally put an updated version that addresses the issue much better.Initially i was concerned that I was out of luck and that this could be a trackpad hardware limitation. Thankfully a bit of investigation digging through the registry in the HKLM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ElanTech revealed a plethora of values that seeemed promising.Further investigation led to a rather huge thread on this topic on the laptop  support forums for the elan trackpads on Samsung laptops. A bit of spelunking revealed an updated driver (10.7.16.1). This one proved to be a winner. Not sure if it was the actual driver update, or the very significantly different configuration settings in the registry that made the difference, but at the end of the day the problem is mitigated nearly completely (and without disabling the trackpad while you are typing).I think there is still some fine tuning to do with the relatively sensitive trackpad, but am a bit more at ease as I think it's just a matter of tweaking the settings just right. I think the elan folks will get it right with just a bit more time. I wish the control panel utility gave you more tuning options without having to figure it out on a trial and error approach with the registry variables. The newer version samsung is using has an 'advanced' tab which seems to be heading in this directionThis is my first ever review and I am only writing it because I really dig this laptop. I'd hate to have this  not succeed due to the egregious trackpad palm detection issue. Asus's strength is clearly not software QA.A few other observations that I haven't seen mentioned before.4) The adapter when plugging into socket always seems to spark as it's plugged in. I haven't seen this from any other adapter, so am wondering about the reliability. It also seems to run a bit hot compared the mac one. This is just an observation, not an issue (i had no less than 5 adapters fail with the HP). Update: I was looking for additional adapters so I don't have to keep carrying the one around, they seem to extremely expensive online, ~$120. There are non ASUS brands available all the way down to $15, so will probably try one of those, I wonder what the difference is. I suspect it's to do with the charging logic / led indicator on the OEM one. I thought the charging controller was in the laptop and not the adapter, but not entirely sure about this now.5) The keyboard is just fine, I saw some posts ranting about ux31 keyboard, and i don't know what they are talking about. It's pretty good, and i type reams.6) There is bleeding of light at the bottom of the lcd, but it's a non issue and an observation i made only because I read about it on other reviews.7) The keyboard backlighting is nice to have.. but again, don't think it's as big a deal as it's been made out to be when it was missing in ux31e.8) The display hinge is just fine, it holds up well. If you suddenly lift it, then there might be a tad amount of sway. I think it's only because this laptop is so thin and light that people apply more g's. (I couldn't do that with my old laptop with both my hands if i wanted to because it was so heavy). It feels pretty sturdy compared to the luddite laptop i am used to.9) I had tried win 8 for a short period on this laptop, seemed to work about the same. (Reverted to win 7 for work reasons after an hour or so).10) The battery seems to last 6+ hours with just web browsing / email..11) The wifi has been working well, no problems so far. The previous HP laptop I had would lose WIFI connection whenever the microwave went on for a minute. This one hasn't exhibited that problem.12) The USB to Ethernet adapter is unfortunately 10/100, not Gigabit.. and for me it's a big deal. Copying around large VMs is the norm and this limitation is a rather big issue. The limitation seems to be from the PHY ASUS is sourcing from 'asix'? They seem to have a new USB3 to GBE part available, so I'm sure in future models this limitation will be addressed. I wonder why they didn't go with USB 2 to GBE phy as it seems to have been available for a while. It works well, counter intuitively its actually proving to be nicer to use the USB connection than the RJ45 jack.13) The built in VGA adapter worked great when using a projector. Haven't tried out the HDMI out yet, need to go buy a micro HDMI cable.14) Headphone out works fine, another reviewer mentioned an issue so tested it just in case.Rating a 4, due to the trackpad runaround that's now resolved. Folks with trackpad issues should just get the latest version from ASUS or Samsung support site. I prefer the Samsung driver.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Possibly the best lightweight computer--ever", "Author": "Rob Kerr", "ReviewID": "R3AEC3MMPE3AVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned probably 20 laptops in the past (my wife would probably say that's 17 more than I've needed).  But to be honest, I've not loved any one of them. Each has come with some sort of compromise that kept it from fully meeting my expectations. Lightweight machines have been underpowered; small screens have had low resolution--leaving me yearning to plug into a full size LCD panel whenever I could; machines with fast CPUs burned my lap and had horrible battery life....and so on.The Zenbook UX31A is the first computer I've owned that has everything I want: super light weight, solid build quality, fast performance, beautiful display, decent battery life, high performance SSD and (I am a touch typist) a keyboard with great tactile response. Using the UX31A is like driving a German car: everywhere you look, you notice the level of attention to detail in design, and you just know the designers really cared about the end-user experience and didn't simply set out to meet a specification as cheaply as possible.Asus may have shot themselves in the foot, though: I'm so satisfied, I may not feel the urge to replace this computer for a long, long time.What you'll love:1. The full HD IPS display with matte finish is dreamy.  Maybe you think 1920 x 1080 is too high a resolution for a 13\" display?  It's not!  With text set to 125%, text is the \"right\" size, and the fonts are as smooth as a printed page--I can't see the individual pixels.  The IPS makes for a screen that's readable at any angle--a godsend for me when the person in front leans their seat back in coach!2. The keyboard is much improved from the last version, and has the exact feel of my MacBook (which to me is a good thing).  The backlighting on the keyboard is a nice addition as well.3. Instant on.  After opening the lid, the computer is usable in around 1 second. Amazing.4. The aluminum case is impossibly thin, making it super portable.  Everyone who sees this machine can't believe it's a real, full Windows PC.5. The DC power supply. I'm in love with a DC power supply?  If you travel a lot like I do, then you understand.  This isn't just a generic $2 item Asus sourced from eBay. It's an impossibly tiny power supply that weighs almost nothing and has an 8 foot cord that will reach from any conference room table all the way to a wall outlet.  Yes, it's a small detail, but something I appreciate every time I use it.6. Build quality.  The solid metal case is completely rigid and exudes quality industrial design.  A $1,000 product shouldn't feel like you got it in a box of cereal, and this one doesn't!  Great job, Asus!7. Bang & Olufsen audio.  Remember when choosing a 13\" laptop meant you live with a speaker originally designed for a wristwatch?  Those days are over--watching video on this laptop is like watching it on your TV!  Audio is loud, clear and has a full range of sound.  You'll only use your headphones when you don't want to disturb others.8. The included fabric envelope to carry the notebook is so good you'll actually use it!  It's a heavy fabric envelope that I find superb for taking the notebook on short trips to the coffee shop or to a meeting where I only need to take some notes.9. Runs Windows 8 (June Preview edition) perfectly.  I scratch-loaded Windows 8, and while it takes some patience to get all the Windows 7 drivers and utilities installed on Windows 8, everything works beautifully.What you may not love as much:1. There's a downside to making a laptop that's thinner than legacy VGA, Ethernet and HDMI connectors--there's no room for them!! Instead, a Micro-HDMI and Mini-VGA connections are provided along with dongles that adapt to standard sized connectors.  For wired Ethernet, a USB-to-Ethernet adapter is provided. Some ultrabooks are specifically made thicker expressly to include legacy connectors.  For me, that's a little silly...an ultrabook should be as thin as possible!  But if you disagree and don't like the idea of a dongle for making VGA connections, then you may want one of the thicker Ultrabooks instead.2. The Zenbook doesn't have the longest battery life among all Ultrabooks. Maybe the thin case has a smaller battery than others?  You'll probably get 5 hours or so of battery life on continuous usage.  If you need another hour or two, there are ultrabooks can last longer.  For me, I find that with the instant on enabled, I can go all day between charges...I just shut the lid when I'm not using the computer and open it when using it (similar to using an iPad).3. The UX31A, like most Ultrabooks, has 4GB RAM soldered to the motherboard, and no way to upgrade RAM.  I think this is really a shame, since I'd gladly have paid more to get more RAM as an insurance policy against what I might want to use the machine for in the future. However I find 4GB is enough for what I'm doing day-to-day, and I doubt most people using an Ultrabook for business scenarios will find they need more than 4GB RAM with Windows 8.  However if you're editing video, this might not be the right machine for you.Overall, I think Asus took the best Ultrabook and made it even better.  The last version (the \"E\" model) was, in my mind, the best small Windows notebook on the market...but fell just a little short of the elegant design of the MacBook Air.  This new model, however, has moved the bar up insanely high for other Ultrabooks, and in my mind eliminated any reason why a Windows user would switch to a Mac to get superior hardware designs. I have a MacBook Pro...and this is the first time I can honestly say I like a Windows laptop more than a MacBook!", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A solid ultrabook", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R1P6Z8XDFX4PPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Edit: My second laptop doesn't have any problems. I'm getting about 5 hours of battery life while doing light programming and listening to music on auto-brightness (there's a brightness sensor) which sets the display at about 60 percent brightness indoors.I received this laptop a few hours ago and I'm going to give my first impressions on the device.Build Quality and Design:Apart from the different color on the keyboard and lack of hideous script font above the keyboard that was on the original zenbook, the Prime looks about the same. Since this is the 31A, it has a Aluminum Unibody design, and from messing around with various Macbook Air's this device seems to be just as well built. I like the front panel design over the Air but that's down to personal preference.Accessories:Being an $1000+ device I would expect a nice amount of goodies, and included is a VGA and Ethernet adapter. There is no micro-HDMI to HDMI adapter, but I find myself using VGA most of the time when giving presentations anyway, so I suppose that's not too bad of a loss. The Air (afaik) does not come with these adapters so that is a small plus. The adapters have their own little pouch to store separately. The combination synthetic leather/canvas sleeve that is included fits fairly snugly, though there is enough space to cram in an adapter if you need to. The AC adapter is about the same size as the Apple counterpart, which is good.Screen Quality:Being a UX31A the laptop packs a 1920x1080 Matte IPS panel. In a not-very-scientific test viewing angles (obviously) far exceed that of my desk TN panel, and brightness and contrast all seem to be much better. Granted, I'm comparing to a 23\" Hanns LCD I paid $60 for. There was a comment earlier about the screen being dimmer than that of the previous gen, and I haven't tested it outside, but it seems to just fine for my purposes. The matte finish is also a plus. There is a bit of back light bleed on the bottom and right hand sides of the screen, but when watching a sample 1080p movie, it didn't bother me at all. I like the increased resolution on the device and it's a definite step up from traditional 1366x768 panels. Text is sometimes a bit small on the default size in chrome but that is easily remedied.Performance:Thankfully, an ADATA XM11 128GB SSD is included. This is a Sandforce drive and I'm getting benchmark scores of 470/150 MB/s RW Sequential, 18/44 MB/s RW 4K random, 113/144 MB/S RW 4k Random 64QD, and access times of .155/.277 ms RW, for a total score of 462 in AS-SSD. This is comparable to my old Vertex 2 in my desktop, so no worries about disk performance here. The system boots boots in about 20 seconds and resumes quickly. It scores a 7.9 WEI in terms of disk performance, though that's not a the best indicator in general.I haven't done anything intensive with the CPU yet but things seem to be holding up well with little slowdown. I also tried messing around in Diablo III on the integrated HD4000 graphics. I set the game to 1024x768, and everything else to minimum, and from a short session of Act III Inferno, the graphics performed okay, with some stutter and slowdown depending on how many effects were on the screen. If you want to do more than just casual gaming, go for the UX32VD with the GT620M graphics. After playing for a bit the fan kicked on and hot air began coming out of the vent located above the keyboard. The fan was not loud enough to hear over the speakers, which put out a decent amount of volume for the size of the laptop.Keyboard/Trackpad:Asus touts the keyboard as being much improved over the previous generation, though I'm not sure if I notice that. I've tried out the original zenbook at stores a few times and this feels similar. I've typed this review on the keyboard without any problems, but it'll be clear to you that you are typing on a scissor-switch laptop keyboard. This also leads to me to the flaw in my item - the backlight. Two of the keys in the center refuse to light at all, regardless of the brightness level I set. Hence, it's going back to Amazon for an exchange. Pity. The trackpad is made by Elantech, which may make some people cringe, but for the most part, I haven't had a problem. I like to rest one hand on the left click button and right other to scroll, and there were no glitches I noticed in the last few hours. The only multi-touch feature I really use is two finger scrolling, which works well enough in Chrome. It's not as smooth as OSX is, but I would assume that is because of Windows 7, and will be improved in Windows 8.If you're trying to decide between this and the Air, it mainly comes down to a few factors - OS, Screen Quality, Discrete Graphics, and support. If you have a rabid obsession with one OS over the other your choice should already be clear. If you value screen quality, both are solid choices - while the Air has a 1440x900 TN panel, it still looks good, though the viewing angles are likely not as wide, and the resolution obviously lower. Anandtech rates both this laptop and the Air well in screen quality. If you value discrete graphics, only the UX32 line offers you that. If you value support I would go with the Air, as nothing beats being able to go into a store and coming out with a fixed laptop.If you're set on Windows or want a 1080P IPS Panel, no other ultrabook touches the Zenbook prime right now. Sony has a similarly-specced laptop out, which has a GT640LE and 1600x900 screen, but that is much heavier and thicker. This is an expensive device, no doubt, so if you can give up some screen quality and are okay with slightly slower integrated graphics, you should consider a previous gen ultrabook.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Zenbook Prime DB51", "Author": "foot attack", "ReviewID": "R1HZRMMT9SQP42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this Zenbook Prime UX31A-DB51 ultrabook from Amazon and received it promptly and in perfect condition this week. The i5 proc (newer \"ivy bridge\" model) has plenty of power for my use (and for almost any average use), and for what I'm using this for, I also don't need more than 128GB of storage, so I decided to go with this model instead of the DB72, which has the i7 proc and 256 SSD. I had been waiting for this upgraded Zenbook to come out for a little while, and Amazon was the 1st place I found that had it available, and I have usually had very good experiences purchasing through Amazon, so the negligible difference in price between Amazon's price and the suggested retail price wasn't an issue.  So far, this is everything I thought it would be and I absolutely love it. In my opinion, the display is extremely nice, HD 1080p, and the screen is low-glare, so it looks great and is easy on the eyesight. In addition to the newer model proc, the screen is another nice upgrade from the previous Zenbook.  The keyboard is perfect and comfortable (and backlit, which the previous Zenbook was lacking). It's very light and portable, fits in my purse with the included envelope-type sleeve, which is a pretty decent cover, at least until I find a sleeve or case I like better.After researching many different models and manufacturers, the only other \"ultrabook\" that I considered before purchasing the Zenbook Prime was the Macbook Air. I'm not an Apple product hater, but I honestly just prefer a Windows machine, so this ultrabook was the clear winner for me, and I couldn't be happier with it so far. I could go on and on comparing the two machines, and describing the technical specs of this Zenbook Prime, but there are so many technical reviews out there that already do that very well (and I think Apple/Mac vs. PC/Windows thing that I constantly see on forums everywhere is so boring it's ridiculous!!!!), so I'm just giving my initial personal experience and opinions about this product that I purchased in this review. It is awesome! It's lived up to all the critical acclaim and all of my expectations of it so far.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Customers Should Know What They Are Getting", "Author": "Kem", "ReviewID": "R3BOGX2Y3SDKWT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So this laptop can apparently come with two different types of hard drives (both 256 gig ssds). If you buy this laptop, you will either get the Sandisk U100 or the ADATA MX11. An uninformed consumer probably wouldn't know or care what the difference between these two drives are, but they should!The Sandisk U100 has the worst write speeds of current SSDs. The Zenbook prime I ordered was horribly slow at transferring files because of this. When I took the laptop back to the retailer, I requested an exchange for one with the ADATA MX11 hard drive. I was told by the retailer that there is no way to tell which hard drive you will get without opening the retail packaging. Note that opening the retail packaging renders the product used.I feel Asus should put the hard drive brand on the outside of the box so that consumers can make a proper informed decision. The ADATA MX11 outperforms the Sandisk U100 in every way and this can be seen in performance tests when comparing the two.I would not recommend anyone purchase this at this time. At least until Asus is more forthcoming about which SSD they are putting in this Zenbook.Update.Well I must say this has been a pretty horrible experience, and I'm never buying an Asus product again.The screws on the laptop keep falling out. I am now missing 2 of them and the only way to get them replaced is to ship it to Asus.

Zenbook Prime back to Amazon. I've sent back enough by now that Amazon will no longer permit me to just send it back and overnight a replacement. They actually just told me they're going to refund my money because they figure future replacements would probably also be faulty too. That's how bad it is with this thing. Not sure what I'm going to do next, but I may give the Thinkpad X1 Carbon a whirl. It's really a shame, because for the brief window that my Zenbook did work, it was basically the perfect computer. This is, hands down, a 5-star product - IF it worked. But apparently, it just straight-up doesn't. I really, really want to just order another one, because I'd be so happy if I actually got one  that f$*@ing worked, but I honestly believe that I might have to order ten of these things to have a shot at one working product.Doesn't that make this whole line a lemon? Right? I mean, I've never seen anything like this - a laptop that you can potentially go through a half dozen of without ever getting one that functions properly. I've also never had Amazon tell me that, in effect, the product is so hopeless they're just going to give my money back without even attempting another replacement. I wanted to love this laptop. I really did. I still do. But I just can't keep ordering it over and over again when I have so little faith that I'll ever find one that works. This whole thing is a travesty. I never imagined Asus would allow such across-the-board hardware failure in one of their products. My god.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW (written during the brief time that the original item actually worked):I did a great deal of research when I was shopping for my new computer. I knew I wanted an ultrabook and wanted a Windows machine. That, right there, narrowed it down to the Asus Zenbook Prime, the Samsung Series 9, and the forthcoming Thinkpad X1 Carbon. Even though the shortcomings of the Zenbook Prime are very thoroughly documented and, some say, crippling to the user experience, I took the plunge. I am here to tell you I adore this computer and have zero regrets.First, a very general overview of performance: The thing is fast. Very fast. I am not going to split hairs by comparing it directly in measurables to its primary competitor, the better-respected Series 9, but suffice to say that they're comparable. The 9 is faster booting and faster recovering from sleep, and not by a small margin, percentage-wise, but the Zenbook is so fast to boot and recover I frankly couldn't care less. You are into Windows almost instantly upon pressing the power button.The main selling point of this particular machine is its 1920x1080 screen. It does not disappoint. I am not a fan of LCD technology, even the most advanced IPS offerings: my TV is a Pioneer plasma and my phone has a Super AMOLED+ display. Needless to say, I am spoiled in that regard. However, I can say with confidence that the Zenbook Prime's FHD IPS LCD display is not only gorgeous in its own right, it's probably the best LCD computer monitor I've ever SEEN. Black levels are excellent, colors are shockingly accurate and vibrant, and the level of detail it's capable of presenting is genuinely stunning. The only display on the market superior to this one is Apple's Retina, which, at an even higher resolution and with even better black levels and color gamut, is superior in all regards on paper. But I should note that I've used both and, frankly, the differences are imperceptible in real-world use. My only complaint is that the resolution on this screen is so high, it's impossible to comfortably view most content at 100% size levels. The computer comes pre-loaded with Windows already set to 125%, which works. After that, you'll want to set your preferences in Chrome, IE9, or Firefox, do default all Web pages also to 125%, otherwise you'll find yourself zooming in on literally everything you see. Be aware that some programs don't support different zoom levels right now: like Google Talk, which I ultimately just had to replace with Trillian, because the text was so impossible to read in Google Talk and Trillian would let me make the whole thing bigger.In terms of general real-world performance, this computer leaves nothing wanting. The Core i7 processor is more than adept to do basically anything, you can expand the RAM from 4 GB to 10 GB by inserting a new SODIMM, leaving you with more ram than you'll probably need at any point in this laptop's life. The SSD is adequately sized but comes preloaded with, no joke, probably 60 gigabytes of bloatware. I wasn't able to get rid of much of it just by removing programs; not sure what's eating up all the space. However, when Windows 8 officially launches, I plan to do a fresh install and hopefully reclaim a chunk of that space. The SSD is, itself, a standard size - so you can swap it out with a bigger, faster one if you're so inclined. I stuck with the 128 GB model with the intention of eventually buying a 512 GB aftermarket drive.Finally, I'd like to clear up some bad misconceptions about this computer:1) THE TRACKPAD IS NOT A PROBLEM. Seriously. This is not a bad trackpad. Don't get me wrong - it's not GOOD, either. But if you look around online you'll see plenty of user reviews and professional reviews basically declaring this unit an unusable paperweight because of the horrifyingly dysfunctional trackpad. Yes, when you open the box, the trackpad is horrible. But then all you do is go to ASUS's website, download the updated driver, and download the Beta of ASUS Gesture, and the trackpad is 80% better right there. If you're still not happy with how it works, nothing is stopping you from poopping over to Samsung's website, downloading the Synaptics drivers and installing them to your Zenbook. This will cause the trackpad to behave like any other Synaptics device, which, for the record, is not without its own flaws. I'm happy enough with ASUS's new drivers that I have stuck with them and, actually, the gesture controls are robust and slick. It supports two- and three-finger touch for cycling up and down windows, between programs and pages, and rotating images. Very slick. I will complain that sometimes the amount of pressure and movement required to get the cursor to go where you expect it to is unpredictable, and that the reaction on-screen is not always what you want, but I have never met a trackpad that didn't present you with similar issues from time to time. The point is, this trackpad is by no means precise and helpful, but it is not worse than par for the course, either. It should not prevent you from buying this laptop, that's for sure.2) The other main criticism I've heard of this device is that it's killed by a bargain-basement SSD drive. I can't claim to be an expert on SSD performance, but there is nothing about the user experience here that would suggest that the OEM SSD is holding this thing back significantly. I may change my opinion when I eventually upgrade it to an after-market model that meets beefy performance benchmarks, if that creates a noticeable improvement. But for now - it's an SSD. It blows away any 7200 RPM drive ever, of course, and that's what we're all pretty much used to. Again, like with the trackpad, people have made this sound like a deal-breaker, ad it just flat-out is not. It's fine. Maybe you find yourself wanting to replace it with something faster; that's fine. It's replaceable. But nothing about it has suggested to me that I'll want to.3) Finally, there IS light-bleed at the bottom and side edges of the screen. There's quite a bit of it, actually, and it's eminently noticeable when you start Windows and see the black Windows-logo splash screen. However, it is literally totally unnoticeable in basically every other usage scenario. It only comes out when the outside edges of the screen are completely black and there is very little picture information populating the rest of the screen. Even watching letterboxed movies, it's there, but it's barely noticeable against the backdrop of this panel's gorgeous reproduction of HD video.Some people inevitably come back to the thinking: you know, it's so expensive, and it does have some problems - why wouldn't I just buy a MacBook Air? That is a perfectly valid choice. Indeed, the MacBook Air has NONE of the shortcomings that this laptop does, and the prices are very comparable. But can you get a MacBook Air with a Core i7 for this price? No. Can you get a MacBook Air with the Retina display at all? No. Here, you can have an i7 and a borderline indistinguishable equivalent to a Retina display in a 13.3\" ultrabook for very close to the base MacBook Air price. For someone like me, who prefers Windows, that is a no-brainer.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sleek, Snappy, and Slim!", "Author": "James H.

The matte screen + the resolution makes this a wonderful choice for watching movies or working outdoors. Everything is very responsive and runs extremely smoothly and quiet for the most part. The instant on is an awesome feature as well. I never realized how much I would need something like this until I got this laptop. Now I can't imagine going back to my old one with its slow restart and resuming speed.I never owned the previous Zenbook UX31e so I can't compare, but from what I've heard, the Zenbook Prime UX31a has fixed some of the keyboard issues that people were complaining about with the older model. I don't know if it's true since I haven't tried typing on the older model, but I have no problems typing on this.With that said, I just wanted to address a couple of issues that people have been mentioning on various sites on the web.1. Backlight bleeding [updated] - If you're extremely lucky, you'll get a unit with hardly noticeable backlight bleeding. My first unit that I had to send back due to problems with wifi was great, but the unit I received after that had terrible backlight bleeding. My sister has also ordered the same ultrabook and she has had terrible bleeding on hers too. ASUS needs apply better quality control to their products and figure out a way to fix this it seems. However, if you're not going to be watching movies with dark screens or do things like photo editing, you'll probably have no issues with the backlight bleeding for you won't see it, if you aren't looking for it! For those who will be watching movies in the dark (unless you have your brightness setting on low or you're running off the battery saving power plan) you'll definitely see the bleeding that can distract. If you get a screen with little bleeding, KEEP IT! Don't exchange it in hopes that you'll get a PERFECT screen with absolutely no bleeding because you won't. I totally regret sending my first unit back, but I had to with the wifi issue which seemed to be a hardware issue.2. Fan noise - this seems to be a hit and miss for people as well. So far, mine has been relatively quiet. However between yesterday and today the fan was running for long periods of times at full speed. I looked into the resources list and found out that the bluetooth device manager was acting up for no reason, so once I killed that, the laptop has gone back to being almost silent again. I'm in a quiet room right now and I can't hear it at all. So if you think the fan is acting up for no reason, go into your task manager and look through the resources list.UPDATE - My sister received a unit with a fan noise issue that some on the web have been describing. Her fan was spinning at max speed, extremely loudly for 5-15 second periods every minute for no reason at all. If you're experiencing this issue, send it back. It is not something that should be happening.3. Keyboard Flex - this issue seems to be more reported among UX32VD purchasers, but just in case people were wondering, I cannot get the keyboard to flex at all on my UX31A unless I'm intentionally pushing down with a lot of force, which would probably end up breaking the laptop before you experience the amount of flexing people have been worried about.So if you're looking for a light, extremely portable machine that still packs enough power to carry out your everyday tasks and a bit more with a great screen that's matte (which will cut out glare associated with glossy displays) you just can't get any better than this ultrabook. However, if you're looking for a laptop you can replace parts with, such as upgrading the RAM and such, but still want the look and feel of this model, check out the Zenbook Prime UX32VD.P.S. I got the ADATA Sandforce SSD as well. It seems so far everyone who has received this model at least has gotten the ADATA rather than the Sandisk unlike previous generation Zenbooks.-[6/28/2012 UPDATE - I started noticing a wi-fi issue. I noticed that it started getting slower and slower at connecting to the internet. I would have to wait an extra 20 seconds or so for the wi-fi to connect after I revived it from standby (this is 20 seconds after windows had all loaded up). Not something I noticed when I had first gotten it. Then today, we changed our internet service provider. The Zenbook Prime struggled very hard to connect when the 2 other laptops in our house connected with no problem. Once it managed to connect, the connection was so slow, I couldn't even load a google search. I tried to restore everything to the factory condition just to see if that would help with anything in case the driver settings somehow got messed with (although highly unlikely), but then it got stuck on and endless cycle of restarting and shutting down with no way to stop it unless I force shut it down. It was absolutely bizarre.As this is a new laptop, it shouldn't be having issues like this to start with, so it's going back. I still love this thing though, so I'll be ordering the same model again and hope that the new one will have the fantastic no bleed screen + perfectly lit up keys + no dead pixels like my current one, but without the wi-fi issue and the endless rebooting! Will update when I get the new one.[6/30/2012 UPDATE - Just got my new one today as Amazon is amazing with their customer service and overnighted the replacement to me! Anyways, this one had the other wifi issue that people had been talking about in the later reviews here and on the UX31A-AB71 page. The wifi connection arrived disabled to start with, and I had to manually go into the driver settings to enable it. Once that was enabled, I was able to connect but the connection was extremely slow and the wifi dropped off and on. The wireless adapter seems to be unstable when using N setting on routers.Thanks to user 'foot attack' who pointed out this work around the connectivity issues with N-routers, I was able to get it working with my other router. If your router is on the N mode, change it to the G mode through your router settings and see if that works. I tried setting up the internet connection with my other router with the N enabled and noticed that the connectivity issue was only solved once I switched back to G through the router settings. Quite annoying, I hope ASUS will be able to fix this soon with a new update as N-routers are pretty much the standard these days.So far so good on the replacement laptop minus the N wifi connection issue. The only thing driving me insane right now is my space bar is squeaky! Hopefully it'll stop squeaking on its own, or I guess I'll have to try putting some oil under it to see if it helps. Oh, also, the trackpad/touchpad on this replacement seems much easier to physically click on than my previous one, which I had to press on really firmly to get the click to register.P.S. There is backlight bleeding this time on the new unit while my previous unit had a perfect screen :( , but you only see it on dark screens so oh wells, doesn't matter.Nevermind, turned up the brightness setting and tried watching a movie on it. The bleeding is really really bad. It totally distracted from the movie whenever the scene was a bit dark. I could have dealt with little backlight bleeding, but not this.[7/8/2012]I loved almost all features about this laptop except for the sensitivity of the touchpad and the backlight bleeding (Out of the 4 units my sister and I've had between us for this laptop, only one had little backlight bleeding that didn't distract. Rest of the units had pretty bad bleeding with other issues on top of it. ASUS needs to take into the issue of quality control with this model for we've experienced random issues on top of major backlight bleeding. However besides those two factors, this notebook is definitely one of my favorites I've ever owned. It's quiet, responds instantly, and the display is amazing (when not watching a movie with dark screens in a dark room), and looks ultra sleek and feels extremely well made.However, I've gotten tired of trying to receive the perfect unit, so I've sent my second unit back for a refund and will probably wait until later on in the future to repurchase. My sister, however, is a bit more patient than I am, and is waiting for a new unit.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent in so many ways", "Author": "Chouser", "ReviewID": "R3CL9X9RND6L4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Primary complaint: backlight bleed.  Near the edges of the screen are patches that are brighter with washed-out color.  This is almost impossible to spot unless the screen is completely black and the backlight is on, but is then quite noticeable and can be distracting.  Amazon very helpfully and promptly replaced my first unit and while the replacement is marginally better, the problem is still visible.  This is particularly a shame since the display is otherwise one of this notebook's best qualities.But I'm enjoying it so much I'm likely to keep it anyway.  This is no netbook.  The screen has as many pixels as you could hope for from something that fits on your lap (MacBook Pros notwithstanding), the keyboard is complete and uncramped, and it's *snappy* (TF2 runs beautifully at 90 fps).  And yet the lightness and battery life means this is a very mobile device.  It even comes with a cute cloth envelope to carry it in, if you're into that sort of thing.So many nice touches:- The display contrast is stunning.  In a dimly-lit room, almost painful at full brightness, which leaves enough range that I can use this outside in the shade on a bright, sunny day.- At 165 pixels per inch, even antialiased text is crisp, and white expanses are smooth.- No confusing grid of status lights. The power status light (green for charging, amber for charging) is on the power connecter, where it's easily visible when in use, it's meaning obvious, and isn't visible at all when not plugged in. Wifi status is by the wifi toggle fn key, power light on the power key (plus another on the right edge so you can see it blink when suspended with the screen closed).- Booting and resuming from suspend are pleasantly quick.- There is sometimes some fan noise, but even while I was using the notebook the fan often shut off completely.- People complained about the keyboard on earlier zenbooks -- I have nothing to complain about on the feel or travel of this one.- My initial charge gave me a full 5 hours of light wifi use, even in linux.Little annoyances:- I miss having separate page-up/page-down buttons.  It seems like the case is big enough that they could have fit them in, but I suppose I'll get used to using the fn key.- When sitting back from the keyboard, the points of light backlighting the keyboard are visible in a sparkly, distracting way.- I don't like the feel or sound of the touchpad buttons. They feel a bit wobbly, and sound hollow when you click.  But I expect not to use them much as two- and three-finger gestures are fully supported in Windows and Linux.- Out of the box only 72.4GB of the 128GB SDD are free. There's nothing like starting your use of a new computer by taking out the garbage.- In Windows while I'm typing, the touchpad is susceptible to interpreting the palm of my hand as a mouse movement or click. There's a control panel with settings that seem meant address this, but I couldn't figure out how to make it work well.  In linux I'm pretty happy with: synclient PalmDetect=1 PalmMinZ=1 PalmMinWidth=4Ubuntu 12.04 (Linux) works well. Some notes:- Make sure you install the 64-bit version of Ubuntu in order to get EFI support- After initial install the computer would sometimes lock hard, requiring holding the power button for 6 seconds to reboot -- this seemed to happen most when scrolling rapidly so I suspect an X or GPU problem. I haven't tested very thoroughly yet, but since upgrading to kernel 3.4.0-030400-generic and intel xorg driver 2.19.0 I haven't seen this problem again.- Touchpad clicking acts weird -- can't drag while holding the left button, right-click is taken as a left-click. But as I said above I don't really like the feel of the buttons so I'll be using the well-supported gestures instead.- Use <ESC> during ASUS splash screen to bring up the EFI boot menu to boot off your installation USB device.- The way Ubuntu installed grub, the grub menu items for Windows didn't work. Use the EFI boot menu mentioned above instead.- Lots of things work well without any tweaking: camera, speakers, mic, USB/ethernet dongle, suspend/resume, wifi, bluetooth- Some things do not: keyboard and screen backlight fn keys", "Date": "June 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "[Updated 7/14/2012] A decent laptop", "Author": "Imran", "ReviewID": "RTV1SOMXK1CG7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update3: My newer unit even had wireless problems after awhile. It wasn't really an n-router problem because I disabled n-mode and was still having trouble connecting to regular g or b. My new one also had horrible backlight bleeding. It turns out that I got fed up of this laptop after reading the cons so I just returned it for now. I may get the UX31A-DB51 again, but for now I am laptop-less. I just feel like Asus has not put enough time into ensuring that users get the optimal experience. It shouldn't take 3 Zenbooks for a user to not experience wireless problems or have a good trackpad or something.Update2: Got my new Zenbook. It also had Wireless problems, but they weren't as bad as my old one. I was able to fix these problems by tweaking my router settings. Everything is great now. Anyways, for the sake of testing out this keyboard, I might as well finish this review.Pros:- Amazing 1080p display- Great Bang & Olufsen sound- Looks very nice- Backlit keyboard- Fast Ivy Bridge processor- Very fast startup times- Great Amazon warranty - replaced in 1 day- Excellently packed + sleeve given- Very light and portableCons:- Wireless problems. If you have an n-router, you WILL need to tweak out your settings- Comes with a lot of bloatware- Battery life is just \"okay\"- Touchpad needs to be tweaked in the settings before it is usable- Colors on display are a little saturated- The Fn key needs to be used to access volume and brightness control by pressing Fn+F-key combo. I think it would be a lot more useful if those volume and brightness keys were able to be pressed without Fn, and Fn would be used only to access the actions of the F-keys. I'm making it sound complicated, but I basically mean the opposite of what it is now.- Asus tech support is pretty much useless. They assume you're some amateur with computers. You're better off just returning your Zenbook to Amazon if you think you have a major problem because they give you free 1-day shipping anyways.Update: After trying many things to try and fix my network issues, I have decided just to get a replacement. Amazon is coming to pick mine up tomorrow and will give me a new one. I will update about my new Zenbook once it comes.Just got my product. I love the 1080p display, the Bang & Olufsen sound, super speedy ADATA SSD, and basically everything about it. However, I have experienced a MAJOR problem that just makes this product annoying for me. I've had issues connecting to my Wireless Internet ever since I got the laptop. It was the first thing I noticed and did not leave a good impression. When I click connect to my network, the Zenbook takes ages to connect and usually stops at \"Limited access\" or \"No network access\". After several attempts, it *sometimes* connects to the internet. I know for a fact that it isn't a problem with my internet because the 3 other laptops that I have connect to the network easily. I also tried tethering the Mobile Network from my phone onto the laptop via WiFi and it wouldn't work. I've been trying to fix this and I'm going to call Asus to try to fix this problem. Hopefully it isn't a hardware issue and I won't have to return it. Asides from this problem, the laptop is great and I'm excited to use it.

The screen is absolutely beautiful. The keyboard is much improved over its predecessor, the original zenbook. The speakers really are the best I've seen on a laptop. I found going all the way to 100% volume was too loud, 50% is a nice sweet-spot for listening to your favorite music. I'm a classical music fan so I definitely know what to listen for, the high notes, the low notes, and everything in-between. The backlit keyboard really helps make this product more usable, especially since I will be heading off to college soon. Asus does install quite a few proprietary programs on this machine. Some are helpful while others just kinda seem like bloatware. I would recommend uninstalling the bing bar (unless, of course, you are a fan of bing.) Keep the McAfee if you want a traditional security service, otherwise Microsoft Security Essentials should work fine for people who REALLY know how to use a computer. Going back to the hardware, the trackpad is awesome. Although I'm not the biggest fan of using them, this trackpad works quite well. For my physics friends out there, the coefficient of friction for the trackpad is close to zero.

TO those of you wondering about the SSD brand it's your lucky day, ASUS switched back to the ADATA SSD (XM11 to be exact.) Hope that helps.

I'll go through what I view as the key features one-by-one.The build quality is very good, and although the laptop is quite light, the palm rests do not sag at all. The keyboard is also quite good for a laptop of this small.The screen is mostly good. The 1080p resolution makes it very sharp, and the screen has a very high maximum brightness. The only problem with the screen is that there is some bleed on the bottom from the backlight; when the screen is black, some regions on the bottom edge of the screen are a bit brighter. Despite this problem, this is still one of the nicest laptop screens I have seen.One nice touch is that the built-in speakers have very wide tonal range and overall sound quality for a laptop. Previous laptops I have owned have had a tendency to hiss or rattle at certain frequencies. The speakers on the Zenbook Prime cannot, however, be turned up very loud. I find the volume sufficient for listening to music while I work, but I wouldn't try to listen to music in a crowded room.I am running this computer dual-boot, with both Windows 7 and Ubuntu Linux. For anyone interested in using Linux, you'll be interested to know that after a little bit of tweaking, everything but the brightness function keys works. Screen brightness can still be adjusted through settings dialogs, but the keybinding doesn't work. Intel graphics drivers are fairly well supported, and 3D desktop effects are smooth. If you google \"Zenbook Prime Ubuntu,\" you'll find step-by-step instructions for tweaking Ubuntu on the Zenbook Prime. On the Windows side of things, everything worked out of the box. I have heard that the fan can be loud in Windows. I have not experienced this, but that may be due to the fact that I updated the BIOS soon after setting up the laptop.In all, if you are looking for a light computer that is both reasonably powerful and aesthetically pleasing, I recommend this laptop heartily.

It came with the faster AData 128GB SSD rather than the slightly slower SanDisk models.A beautiful laptop - looks better than any of the competing Ultrabooks I have laid eyes on and even better than the Macbook Air (which to me is starting to look dated). The keyboard emits a nice glow and there are no cheap-looking plastic bits or tacky embellishments, just solid looking metals with aesthetically pleasing textures/patterns on them.It is well constructed in terms of sturdiness. There is hardly any flex in the screen, for example, when you open the lid. It comes with nice accessories such as a brown slip case, displayport-to-vga adapter and crucially a USB ethernet adapter. I have caused a scratch on the undersurface of the laptop already but I suppose that is to be expected as I'm taking this thing everywhere with me.The keyboard is solid and I have had no problems touch-typing away from day one. Actually I think I can type faster on this than on my desktop - which has a high-end Logitech keyboard.The trackpad is awful, especially with Asus' current SmartGesture drivers. Most of the problems are to do with poor two-finger scrolling and trying to left and right click.This problems occur pretty much anywhere but particularly in browsers where a small 2-finger swipe can sometimes shoot you to the bottom of a long page or a long, fast swipe will sometimes move you 2 lines further down. Add to that the inconsistent clickiness of the button, where sometimes in the process of left or right clicking the mouse cursor will move meaning that you select completely the wrong thing.However, I have learned to cope with the trackpad. First of all I recommend using the Elan drivers (also available from Asus - search for \"Touchpad\" as a device instead of the actual model name of the laptop) rather than the SmartGesture ones - it has more configurable options and is less erratic.Second, I would recommend switching off the click button completely. I have switched it off and made it so that a single finger tap on the trackpad is a left click and two-finger tap is a right click. There is absolutely no misregistration of input using this method in my experience.Thirdly, there is a simple registry tweak you can do to make a three finger tap function appear in the Elan options. I have set this to act like pressing the middle mouse button. If you do this in most browsers, you can scroll around freely and smoothly by just tapping with 3 fingers and then sliding one finger in any direction. Its a fantastic alternative in my opinion and you can even let it scroll without leaving your finger on the pad once you've got it at the right speed. You can also still 2 finger scroll if you wish to do so.Anyway, so with these 3 changes the trackpad is more than liveable... quite good even. I like using 3 finger sweep gestures (left and right - back and forwards; up - task changer; down - show desktop), and I cant complain about the actual single finger accuracy when just sweeping your finger about to locate things.The screen is a mixed bag. As I said in the title - the best and worst thing about this laptop. I have never used a laptop with such a stunning screen before. Wide viewing angles, bright, accurate colours and incredibly sharp thanks to its 1080p resolution crammed in to 13 inches. I have no issues with the small text so I have set Windows to use its natural dpi setting rather than the pre-configured setting by Asus which makes text and other items appear a little bigger. For what its worth, I never encountered any major compatibility problems with the dpi set by Asus before I switched to the Windows default, but I prefer the look of the Windows default - everything looks in the correct proportion.However, the very worst thing about this laptop (finally!) is the backlight bleed on the screen. Having read some forums about the issue, it seems almost all of the laptops produced so far have some degree of an issue with it. What I mean by backlight bleed is that on a dark screen (for example when watching a movie with black bars at the top and bottom) you can see small spotlight-like leaks of light all along the bottom of the screen. Frankly, it looks horrific. I will clarify by saying that it is not possible to see this when doing normal tasks such as web-browsing, document editing etc. The only place most people are likely to encounter it is if they like having a jet-black desktop wallpaper or when watching films with black bars. As I said it appears to be a problem with all the currently produced models so I dont see the point in sending it back - I wont find anything better elsewhere other than possibly a Retina Display MacBook Pro but they are a completely different notebook 'genre' and I would prefer the light weight and portability of this.Some miscellaneous points:a) the sound is pretty quiet in volume and lacks low-end oomph - use headphones when possible, dont believe the Bang & Olufsen hype;b) the battery can last me more than 5 hours with moderate screen brightness and wi-fi connected - which is good for me, may not be enough for you ;-) ;c) it has better reception on the Wifi than any other 'connected device' I have. I can detect neighbours' access points that are completely invisible to my phone, my other laptop, my desktop, my TV, my PS3... you get the idea;d) the laptop comes with a fair bit of bloatware - not as bad as some I've experienced (Dell or HP) but it definitely slows the system down. You will notice that at default it can take 16-18 seconds to cold boot to a useable desktop. Most of it is very easy to remove within the Control Panel and it has an instant effect of speeding up the whole system - it can cold boot in 10-12 seconds once the majority has been purged. Waking from sleep takes no more than than the advertised 2 seconds.e) after waking from sleep there seems to be some sort of glitch which makes the system fan constantly cycle from off to low to medium to high and then back again over the course of a minute or so. It does not happen after cold booting. I expect Asus will release some sort of fix for this in the way of a firmware upgrade. It's really not that bothersome to me though.That's it for my incredibly long review. Hope some of that was helpful. My overall opinion is that of a fantastic notebook let down by one or two minor issues and one or two more serious ones. For me it all works out and I have yet to see anything better for my needs, but be warned if some of these issues are a show-stopper for you.Kind Regards,", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "The one I have been waiting for!", "Author": "J. Oliver", "ReviewID": "R320IA5CKFY4VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a new ultrabook since my prior unit stopped booting randomly four years ago. I picked up a cheap Asus a few months after beginning my search due to budget restrictions that came upon me. When the first generation Asus Zenbook launched, I loved the appearance of it and the majority of aspects surrounding it. After a few months, letting the reviews come in, I went into a Best Buy, where I was talked out of buying it because there was rumors of a new version, this unit, that would be released. I obsessed over this ultrabook, and the day it was posted on Amazon, I jumped at it.Overall Appearance: Sleek and stylish with sharp edges, a very modern looking design. I love the solid body aluminum design. While it does resemble the Macbook Air in a lot of ways, that is what I like about it. Apple did things right, and other companies are following suit, while making improvements at the same time.Display: The display is amazing on this ultrabook. I have always utilized a high resolution on my desktops and previous ultrabooks, and the full 1080p resolution tops it for me on this one. As for the brightness, I actually had to turn it down in a dimly lit room, finding it too bright for my eyes. I took it outside on the patio, and the contrast and display allowed for use without a lot of glare. Very versatile, can be used anywhere, which could be one if its flaws. Because of the wide angle view, public use may be difficult if you are working on something sensitive or private, luckily neither of which I don't have to worry much about.Performance: This thing is great for everything I have thrown at it. I installed Diablo 3 on it, and with a quick tweaking of the settings (mainly upping the resolution to match the display) it was working great. The ssd tied in with the improved integrated graphics engine have really made this one of the best ultrabooks on the market right now. I have played through some of the more intensive quests with no stuttering and only very very minor screen tearing which is common on even some higher end lcd displays. This unit can handle everything that I need it for, from gaming to casual web use, so I am thrilled.Other: The battery life is more than adequate for what I require. After the initial charge, I got 5 hours from it, and that was with some Diablo 3 and youtube mixed in there, so it was as close to \"real world\" results as I could personally get for me. I haven't messed with any of the settings, so getting more out of it is surely possible. The addition of the backlit keyboard on this new version was a great idea, with the option of changing the brightness setting allows for even more versatility.Solid ultrabook for every day and performance use.

And I have to admit, I wanted a machine that looked beautiful and would take the everyday types of bumps and bruises without marks, fingerprints, etc. I have read the reviews that are present on this site. I can see why if something doesn't work or Asus doesn't respond to concerns that folks would give negative reviews as would I. I have given the Zen Prime 5 stars for the following reasons. First of all, it's absolutely the perfect size for both portability and for bedroom computing which I'm doing as I write this review, with the machine resting on my legs and belly! It is very comfortable and solid without seams or misfitting parts. The Zen Prime is also absolutely beautiful to look at. The pics you see don't do it justice! It resists fingerprints and scratches and exudes fine art and quality. The LCD screen resolution is absolutely outstanding with superb brightness and color. I don't know where someone would think that this machine would not be bright enough. If I can see it so well at my age then I think you'll find it very pleasing indeed. Sound quality is very nice for a 13 inch laptop. Bass is lacking but mids and highs are great for the space they have to work with. I have found the keyboard to be almost perfect for my tastes. I never used the previous Zens so can't compare with them, but I find it far more comfortable than typing on a regular desktop keyboard or the one on the Toshiba Satellite I was using before. The backlit keyboard is a Godsend! I don't know how I,ve lived without one before now. It has responded to every task I've dealt with with plenty of speed and no hesitations. I bought an inexpensive Samsung external DVD drive and everything worked first time, plug and play! Finally, I would tell you that everything has worked and worked right since I bought the Zen. No foulups, dead pixels, microphone/headphone issues, keyboard malfunctions, nothing. It has worked perfectly which is after all what we're all looking for. The only thing I wish I could change is having the USB ports on the same rather than opposite sides in case I run into needing more juice than one port can provide. Thus far, the 3.0 USB port has been enough to power everything I've hooked up so it's not been an issue where I've needed the splitter to run from both sides. I hope that this review will be of help to some of you who want a functional and beautiful machine and struggle to decide between the various machines at this level.

But the battery charger stopped working AGAIN. I also noticed that after they replaced the hard drive they forgot to screw all the screws on the laptop cover (so it's literally had missing screws/screws loose). So I am returning this again to their service center.Update 9/11/2012:Finally received my laptop back from Asus tonight after about 4 weeks (8/17-9/11). I had two problems. The power adapter failed and the computer would randomly reboot and checkdisk would freeze at 13% indicating serious hard drive issues. After all this wait, they just sent me back my laptop with a new power adapter. Their manifest doesn't even mention my second (more critical) issue with the hard drive and sure enough, Checkdisk again freezes. What a horrible company and what a horrible computer. I am glad that during the 4 weeks I bought a real laptop now that it seems I have to deal with Asus some more so hopefully they will actually fix the stupid thing or replace it.Cannot re-emphasize enough the need to buy this from a place that can replace this within the first month so you don't have to deal with Asus' slow incompetent service that took about a month to send me a new charger. Will now email the customer service rep who keeps answering people's reviews here to see if I can escalate.Original Review:Buying this product seems like buying a lotto ticket. Sometimes it works, but often it does not or stops working in the first week or so.I bought this from another site which at the time had a better deal than amazon. I read all the reviews so I fixed the touchpad issue etc. But within the first week the zenbook would stop and reboot randomly or would not shut down. I called customer care and after some time I just reformatted the whole computer and it started working mostly but still would randomly (though rarely) reboot. CHKDSK would freeze midway indicating a hard drive problem. Then the charger stopped working.The computer (and the charger) look nice and fancy but I have never had so much problem with any electronic equipment from the start. I finally shipped my Zenbook back 2 weeks ago and it has been in the shop for the last 10 days (depreciating as we speak while \"waiting for parts\").The disadvantage of buying this over an apple Macbook air is that with Apple you can just take it to the apple store and they deal. With this product, you just have to deal with mail etc. and from the sound of other reviews and my experience with two separate portions of the product failing, it seems that you need pretty good support since the product is commonly defective.It did look nice though for the very brief period that it seemed to function. Now I am seriously considering buying a cheaper not so sleek laptop for actual use(from any of the previous companies I have bought laptops from like Sony or Toshiba) which at least functions.I wish I had bought this from Amazon so I could have easily returned it without having to wait on service from the get go.I will update this review when and if they can fix my laptop. Hopefully the price won't drop too much by then so I won't feel like a fool.P.S. they don't even extend the warranty for the time your computer spends away from you in the shop.P.P.S.

I have not had any issues that others have reported such as WiFi, fan, screen, etc.  I am completely satisfied with the laptop. The screen resolution is amazing and makes me hate my other laptop from work that much more. The Zenbook Prime starts up super fast and returns from sleep even faster.  Once I removed all of the bloatware from Asus, I think the whole system is running a bit faster.  The keyboard is tight and responsive without being loud.  I am also enjoying the many gestures available for the touch pad to make navigating that much easier.  To me, the backlit keyboard is pointless since I am not typing in the dark, so I turn down the brightness to zero in order to preserve battery.  On top of all of the great features in the laptop, ir was nice to open the box and find a nice sleeve, all of the adapters I might need, and even a pouch that matches the sleeve to hold all of the adapters.  So far it seems like Asus thought of everything when putting together the Zenbook Prime.

It is really thin closed and looks really good. I then turn on the laptop and on the windows bootup screen you will instantly notice the light bleed, for me it was across all the edges. I figured this is an Asus issue because my transformer tablet has the same issue. I was going to let that slide until I noticed that in the top center there was an area with dead pixels..It was only visible when you had a black being displayed across the screen, but it bugged me to no end so I had to return it.Just received my 2nd replacement and still had light bleed on edges but again no big deal for me.

They come with a fair amount of branded junk on them, but no worse than anything else from other manufacturers. We purchased the model with the core I7 (1.7GHz), 124Gb SSD, 4GB RAM and at the time was shipping with windows 7 home premium. the first unit was configured and is running with no problems, but the second unit has an issue with the display so that the on board screen only shows random colorbars, but the unit sends an image to an external monitor correctly. If you do purchase a unit not running windows professional or higher, you'll need to either upgrade your version to be able to join your network or if you have a corporate license, wipe the machine and do a fresh install. We have a corporate key, but microsoft won't allow you to use a corporate key on the upgrade anytime feature so I purchased another key. The 1st machine has been in use for about 1 month thus far with no complaints (running office, vpn software, corporate antivirus suite and a few other corporate apps). I'm waiting on a response from tech support about handling the unit with the malfunctioning screen (I just began the build yesterday so it's only been 24 hours since I submitted the complaint). If all goes well with the handling of either repairing or swapping the unit then we may purchase more so I'll have a larger sample size for observation. One minor problem is that the SSDs that came in the units were formatted using GUID instead of MBR and the encryption software I normally deploy only supports MBR, so it looks like I'll be giving bitlocker a try. On a side note, I also own a Samsung Series 9 (one of my personals) and I have zero complaints thus far with that unit.To follow up my earlier review I will lower my rating of these units and say they definitely shouldn't be used in a business environment. My company purchased 6 units total and here's a list of issues:1. screws fell out of the bottom of unit #1 (cosmetic, but speaks to build quality)2. unit #2 had a screen problem upon arrival and had to be sent back to have the onboard screen replaced (took about 7 months to get the unit back) also had power supply die after a few months of use which I replaced with a store brand, has been fine since.3. Unit #3 has an issue causing the display to flicker and has lost the ability to output video to a 2nd monitor (it's the unit, not the adaptor).4. the adaptor that is used to connect to a 2nd monitor has malfunctioned on unit #45. unit #5 went into a sleep/hibernation state and will not restart so it needs to be sent in for repair.6. unit #6 has been problem free.Based on that I cannot recommend these machines and our company has already switched to the Dell Latitude 6430u.", "Date": "August 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good, solid, laptop", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R3BL9Q518B6S58", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me begin by saying I got this laptop about 3 hours ago and I have been using it since.

I've been streaming youtube videos at 1080p and the detail is absolutely great.Wireless: This brings me to my next point. While streaming the youtube videos at 1080p, my wireless worked completely fine. No dropped signals and I am about 30 feet away from my router. The signal picks up very quickly after I start up my computer and I haven't gotten any of the other problems other users are explaining.Sound: The sound is excellent, the maximum sound is not overly loud but its definitely sufficient for my usage.Boottime & Speed: It's definitely quick and boots up as quick as it says it will.Cons:Keyboard: This seems to be the only area of concern for me. I miss keys a little more often than I would like and this may because I'm not used to the laptop yet. You don't have to press too hard but you definitely can't just give it a light tap and expect it to register. Other than that the keyboard doesn't have bad flex and the backlighting looks fantastic. If you are a light typer, this keyboard will take some getting used to.Other problems you might be wondering about:Headphone Jack: It works perfectly fine for me.Backlight bleed: Mine is so minimal and trivial. You really can't see it unless you pay really close attention and its only in the lower right hand corner. Very Very minimal.Trackpad: The original settings for the trackpad are terrible. If you just install the latest drivers on Asus's website it works like a gem.

Absolutely gorgeous.I bought this Zenbook Prime to replace a 2011 11\" Macbook Air which, after a bit of water damage, was going to cost $750 to repair. For that same amount I was able to buy this fella used through Amazon Warehouse. It was a no-brainer and I still have no regrets, though I primarily used Windows 8 on the MBA as I find it to be preferable to OSX.I would like to first emphasize how amazing Amazon Warehouse Deals are. This computer came completely refurbished--the only difference between the refurbished Apple products I've bought and this one was the amount of accessories that came with this thing. For the price paid it was absolutely excellent, especially considering it was actually cheaper than the UX31 sporting an i5. It was like new, with no scratches or anything, and it very clearly had a roto-rooter refurb job done on it for much cheaper than the models listed as refurbished.This computer is physically gorgeous. The screen on this thing is life-changing. It is, in my opinion, a prettier package than the Macbook Air--while the Apple aluminum look is now dated, this brushed aluminum look is a head-turner. While the new Haswell chips are excellent for battery life, Apple's failure to incorporate a full HD screen makes the MBA not even worth considering when compared to the UX31. It comes with what would have been $100 worth of accessories--cases, adapters, etc. The backlit keyboard is a nice touch, and the keyboard itself is stately and aesthetically pleasing.Performance is good. While the integrated graphics aren't powerful enough to handle full HD gaming, by lowering the settings slightly Super Meat Boy was playable, and the screen made playing (wandering around?) Fez a great experience. I'm not a real gamer but it has thus far suited my needs. The computer can handle any multimedia one throws at it, and Photoshop runs so easily on this computer I fear it would get bored if it were sentient. I'd highly recommend upgrading to Windows 8 as the vivid colors of the OS really pop. The screen isn't as great as the Chromebook Pixel, and I haven't compared it to the Retna, but for $750 used it's impressive enough to make me forgo watching things on my HDTV. I haven't experienced the leaks around the edges of the screen others have mentioned--the exterior construction is flawless and gorgeous.There is, however, one fatal flaw with the quality control--there is none. I nearly returned this computer, and certainly would have if it weren't for my roommate's torx wrench and a little technical proficiency. There are many reoccurring issues into which buyers of these computers have run (both used and new, leading me to blame Asus rather than Amazon), ranging from light leaks on the outer parts of the screen and the one with which I had an issue--the keyboard just isn't connected strong enough and random keys stopped working (D, delete, and the direction pad) consistently but intermittently. This issue was so common I was able to Google the issue and find out how to fix it. I had to pop open the back of the computer (something I'd assume most would agree shouldn't be necessary with a brand new computer, and something with which many wouldn't be comfortable), take off the MASKING TAPE WHICH HELD TOGETHER THE KEYBOARD CONNECTOR and reconnect it. Since I've done this I have absolutely zero complaints about the computer, but for a computer that typically retails for over $1000 this seems a bit egregious. I know if virtually any of my relatives had purchased this computer it would be considered \"broken.\"It is really tough to recommend this laptop to anyone without a bit of technical proficiency due to these sort of quality control issues. I nearly returned it, knowing I can't trust the innards to not fall apart when a piece of tape dries. If you're going to buy this laptop, the most must-have accessory is a torx wrench. If I had the option for half stars it'd have been 3.5, but I can't suggest it's nearly perfect. Now that 1080p is becoming the industry standard for screens, and everyone's producing ultrabooks, it's likely worth looking at some of the competition. I wouldn't discourage you from buying this laptop if you're confident you can handle some minor internal maintenance but that really shouldn't be necessary.

Comfortable keyboard, nice large multitouch trackpad, impressive battery life, beautiful screen. The screen density is almost a curse, as most Windows and Linux software assumes a density of 96dpi as opposed to this laptop's 165dpi and font sizes are quite small by default. Applying a 125% scale in Chrome makes web browsing more comfortable and still gets the benefits of higher density such as clearer text.The extra preloaded software within Windows is a hindrance. Once removed things behave as you would expect.If you plan to run Linux on this laptop, it works wonderfully. All hardware is detected and functions as expected in Ubuntu 12.10, Mint 14, and elementary Luna beta 1. Ubuntu and Mint run without any issues, but elementary has some stability issues at the moment when running Chrome or IntelliJ IDEA 12.In elementary when running Chrome the system is prone to full system lockups that not even REISUB can recover from; expect filesystem corruption when it happens. IntelliJ IDEA's code completion popups will sometimes crash elementary's window manager. They're calling elementary beta for a reason, it's not ready to be a daily driver on this laptop.I love this laptop, but a few nits prevent a 5-star recommendation.

I didn't have to use my other warranty. I'm still not wholly happy that the computer had so many things wrong with it, but I was glad that they replaced everything.  I WILL KEEP UPDATING. II purchased this computer in October 2012 and I've been disappointed with the constant small problems this machine has had out of the box.I assumed when buying a premium laptop, that I would receive a premium product, but I've been very disappointed.I primarily bought the Asus Zenbook because I'm disabled and self employed and I needed a very light but fast laptop.I'm not a programmer, but I run an internet consulting and research business, and I am entirely dependent on the computer for my income.I've been primarily a dell latitude user for the past 10 years, but wanted to treat myself to something that was more state of the art. I was attracted to the ASUS Zenbook as an apple alternative. This is the most expensive computer I've purchased and I had very high hopes for it.The good1) This is a beautiful machine and I loved unboxing it. People compliment me on its beauty all the time.2) I love the responsiveness of the solid state drive. I'm never going back to a traditional hard drive again. The programs and the operating speed is fast fast fast.3) the keyboard is a good size and is easy to type on.4) The computer is really lightweight!5) The audio is pretty good for a laptop.The bad1) The screen is beautiful but very fragile. I've had two six inch white marks spontaneously appear on the screen and I've only owned the computer since October2) From the start I've have a really difficult time with the virtual wi-fi miniport. Although the system usually hooks up to my wifi when the machine is booted up, after putting it in sleep mode I've needed to continually troubleshoot my wifi to get it to reconnect. The troubleshooter has given me various solutions including reloading the wifi card (which is internal). I've used ASUS's online technical suppor which suggested I download new drivers, which I did with no improvement.3) The last straw is that tonight, after less than 3 months of use, the ac adapter has started to misbehave in that way where you need to jiggle to adapter input and pull the wires to get the adapter to recharge the battery, so you have to push and pull at the adapter and it continually stops recharging, and you have to jiggle and jiggle it. I've had this problem with Dells before, and it could be the adapter or it could be a bad soldering job and unlike the other problems, I can't work around this one and still use the machine.I went through a lot of things with the Dell Latitudes, but not in the first three months! I'm really disappointed because I've heard many good things about ASUS and this machine has been a disappointment.I'm currently trying to figure out whether I should deal with ASUS or deal with Square Deal (where I also purchased a warranty) to have these problems fixed.I've tried to contact ASUS by email about my original wifi problem and the person tried to be helpful, but didn't acknowledge that I had already reinstalled the drivers etc. I'd rather go through ASUS so I don't invalidate my Square Deal Warranty, but although they offer accident protection, You need to sign up in several different places, and I'm concerned that I might have missed the deadline by a few days on the accident protection (I'm assuming the screen issue will be considered an \"accident\" even though I have no idea how it got there.Anyway, if you need a laptop for business purposes, you probably want to buy something more reliable, and where you sign up in just ONE place for services vs. multiple place.Maybe I just got a lemon, but I'm sad I'll need to go through the hassle of backing up, boxing up and returning a new computer for a handful of manufacturing or design issues. I'm especially unhappy because it is a premium machine.

Once I updated the driver the problem seemed to go away, and I think there may have been some piece of the problem which just had to do with me getting used to it.  It drove me nuts at first and I thought it was insane for ASUS to release a thousand dollar model with such an obvious problem.  Anyway, we've kissed and made up.

The fact that the mouse moves if you touch the track pad while typing doesn't bother me because I don't touch it while I type. There is a tiny bit of back light bleed at the bottom edge.

I held off, however, because many early ultrabooks had poor screen resolution (imo) and well, we all knew Ivy Bridge was right around the corner.So, after comparing several UB models I decided on this. The price was right, and ASUS seemed to want to push out remedied 2nd gen product (rather than just giving it the simple nip/tuck hardware update).I don't have experience with the 1st gen Zenbook, but I am more than satisfied with this. My favorite part is the display. 1080p on a 13.3 inch screen looks fantastic and the colors are vibrant. Further, the display can stay plenty bright even when dimmed for battery use. With the higher resolution, you might need to tweak icon/text sizing, and Ctrl and + might become your new friend, but it's not any fault of ASUS.The keyboard is not as great as my Apple BT keyboard I use with my iPad, but it is still comfortable to type on. My only gripe is that the trackpad should be centered with the space bar rather than the body of the computer. This palm detection problem pops up when tap to click is enabled. It's not a big deal but it was enough of an annoyance for me that I disabled tap to click.The bottom line . . . it looks great, the display is great, the keyboard feels nice, and the computer feels well built.

I never had any serious issues with those purchase so I decided to stick with them for my latest purchase. As you have probably guessed though, it wasn't long before it started having problems.  It stopped charging within a couple of months of buying it.  I contacted their customer service people and found that Asus customer service is especially abysmal - emails from these people were in unbelievably broken English and the things they told me were inconsistent from one rep to the next.  The only thing that was consistent was that they were all of very little help.  Eventually I was told I would just have to buy a new charger from them.  That irritated me but I was desperate, so I did it.  A few months later, guess what - it wasn't charging again.  So I called up the customer service people again and after a lot of back and forth was told to send the computer in.  I did this and a few weeks later they sent it back in exactly the same condition, still not working.  I called them up again and after some more back and forth was told to send it back in.  I did that, and a few weeks later it came back with another new charger and a replaced part.  I just got it back and is working for the time being, but I have very little confidence in it and it has been a huge inconvenience.  I have owned this computer for less than a year and in that time the computer has literally spent months being of no use to me either because it wouldn't turn on/charge or because it was in transit back and forth and back and forth from Asus.On top of this the firmware they have for the touch pad is really awful, and the fit and finish is not as nice as my friend's Macbook Air.  Basically, under close inspection/first hand use, this think is pretty junky compared to the Air as far as I can tell.  In addition to my more major hardware problems, I have a couple dead pixels and the \"feet\" on the bottom of the computer aren't perfectly aligned such that when I place it on a flat surface there is a slight wobble that can be felt.This most certainly the last Asus product I will ever buy.

Here is a list of PROS and CONS.PROS:1. Screen. 1080p IPS Matte. Nothing more needs to be said.2. Battery life. Despite the power hungry screen, it still can easily last 7 hours of web surfing.3. Touchpad. I used a macbook air and pro for a long time. This Asus has a glass touchpad that functions similarly to a macbook, which is no small feat. It does seem a little oversensitive because  when I type, it would register a random click from me.4. Construction. All metal design, sleek and light. I would like to see a smaller bezel like that on the XPS 13, but otherwise, nothing to complain about.CONS:1. When browsing on Chrome, I find it sometimes have these \"lag hiccups\". Not sure why.That's really it for cons, can't think of anymore. You can argue that it doesn't have a touchscreen or Windows 8, or that 1080p makes the words too small, but that's personal preference for me.

Really liking everything about the ASUS. The system is fast, even when running intense programs like Adobe Lightroom and Premier Elements, as well as the normal usage of browsing and MS Office. Its incredibly light and thin, really astounding coming from a 4 year old laptop.The hardware on the computer is on par or better than that of the MacBook, with nice feeling metals and plastics. The keyboard is just as good as the Mac (and backlit to boot), and the touchpad is the same as far as feel, but lacks when it comes to scrolling performance and gestures (that's going to be the case with all Windows laptops though.) The screen is absolutely GORGEOUS at 1920x1080, just be ready to set your DPI a bit higher and auto-zoom webpages to make things actually readable. The battery life is great, and I can get about 5-6hrs of mixed usage (browsing and listening to music) or about 4 hours of hard use out of it.Overall really hard to complain about too much. It's light, powerful and now that it's being replaced by new Windows 8 units with touchscreens it can be found for a good deal.Bad:The speakers aren't quite as loud as I would like. When listening to a podcast or radio, even at full volume, I can't walk across the room and work around the house without missing out on some of what's playing. Cranking up the levels in something like VLC just ends up distorting the audio too much.The power brick is super small (about the same as modern Apple laptops), but you're stuck with plugging it directly into the wall, and there's no included extension cable. So for awkward/tight outlets, you may not be able to plug it in. The cable that runs from the brick to the laptop is quite long and the connector seems fine, but I just wish there was at least an option to get a longer extension cable so you don't have to plug the brick directly to the wall.", "Date": "December 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Product Support.

ASUS developed a fantastic product and dropped the ball on the quality process.Unfortunately I am now sending back my second one.  The first had a bad graphics card.. even with all drivers updated from ASUS site it would randomly melt down and lock up with noise on the display.  Not cool when presenting to the new client in the boardroom.  So, back it went.The replacement arrived yesterday.  It had a bad keyboard right out of the box as others have mentioned in reviews.  Some keys got better after new drivers were installed, but delete and backspace stopped working and even the enter key is suspect.  So, back it goes.I will say that both units came from Amazon Warehouse Deals in hopes that they would have corrected any problems from the buggy initial unit.  I have historically had very good luck with Warehouse Deals, but they don't seem to be checking these units at all.Because I am a slow learner and I honestly would really like to have a fully functioning unit like this, I am going to give it one more try in hope that I get a good one.  I would not be doing this were it not for Amazons 30 day return policy.My advice it to believe the reviews and if you want to pick one of these up, be sure to install all new drivers from the ASUS site and then put it through it's paces in the first 30 days so you don't get stuck with one of the bad ones.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Keyboard failed in 6 months.

Took it out to start working last week and suddenly the d key wasn't working.  tapped it a few times, pressed the edges a bit to see if I could loosen, but no luck.  Then I discovered the backspace was also not functioning, along with about 5 other keys.  Not good for a 6 week old laptop.  After much trying, tweaking and restarting I gave up and took it to the local authorized dealer.  Keyboard needed to be replaced.  So, it's working fine again, but I'm beset by this feeling of waiting for the other shoe to drop.  Not good.  If it turns out to be an anomaly, then I'm fine with it, and I've just dinged them a star on my rating for poor build quality.  Let's hope that's where it ends.One month update:A few additional tidbits.  Again, my overall vote is still 5 out of 5.  Hard to knock this machine for anything.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be sure to update your trackpad driver from the ASUS site.  I thought mine had updated right after I got it, but somehow it was running the old version.  Maybe I updated it incorrectly or it got rolled back by a windows update.  The new driver is great - the old one could possibly drive you mad.  Any slight brush on the touchpad and the cursor moves, or registers a click.  If you're having problems, go to the ASUS site and download the driver for the newest version.  It's night and day.I'm considering getting a multitouch compatible wireless trackpad to use with this laptop.  Once you start using pinch to zoom and other mutli-touch gestures, you will want to have a mouse that is compatible with this.  It's so convenient to 2 finger scroll or pinch to zoom.  My old scrolling mouse just doesn't seem to cut it anymore.  And I am likely to switch to Win 8 sometime down the road when all of the applications catch up with it, so it will be nice to have something that's win 8 compatible.Finally (and this will be my last entry/review of the product, barring anything drastic happening) I have a small nit to pick with typing on the laptop.  If you actually have the laptop on your lap when typing, the front edge of the laptop tends to dig into the underside of your wrist over time.  You won't notice with long sleeves on, but in shot sleeves it gets annoying after a while.  The edge is a bit of a sharp angle.  Other laptops I've used have had a rounded edge.  Far from a dealbreaker, but a nuisance.  I often use the unit with an external keyboard and mouse, so I don't have the issue often.  But bear in mind if you tend to sit on the couch and type with your laptop when in a t-shirt or short sleeves.You will love this machine.  I do!Update after about a week:So overall my vote doesn't change.  The screen is killer and the laptop is pretty amazing for me.  A few things that I've learned:The trackpad is a little trickier than I thought at first.  I downloaded the updated driver, as many others have noted.  The trackpad is very sensitive to multiple fingers touching it, and to accidental touching when typing.  It's blown away a few paragraphs of mine here and there.  Like anything new, it takes some adjustment.  But it's far from a dealbreaker.  I heartily reommend getting to know the 2 finger gestures.  They are very useful - I never used them with my old HP but I find myself using them often with the Zenbook.The IPS screen's native resolution is amazing, but it ends up showing you some tiny type in Windows.  I find myself messing with the display settings more than expected.  My old eyes can't see type at such tiny sizes, so I get eyestrain.  Hence the value of the pinch and expand gestures on web pages.  Get to know it if you don't have good up-close vision like me.  What's more frustrating is that I go from using this computer as a laptop to then using it with 2 external monitors.  Each time I switch I have to I tinker with the settings so it looks right.  I have at times just punted and gone with 1600x900 resolution to make this process less cumbersome.  But this is still a minor nuisance.  Maybe i will find a more consistent solution.Finally the battery life has been amazing.  Just great!  an entire day of usage, give or take.  Much better than I'm used to.  And the instant on never ceases to delight me.  My old laptop would take minutes to resume and get wifi up and running.  Now it's less than 20 seconds, if that. Buy it buy it buy it now.  You will not regret it!----------------------------------------------------------------------------Got this today and the biggest issue is that I'm drooling on the keyboard because I love it so much.  Perspective is always important when I read these reviews, so here's a little bit about where I'm coming from in my computer needs/experience.I wanted a very light/portable laptop with great battery life.  I do a lot of web browsing and using online apps like dropbox, as well as MS word type things, including PowerPoint.  I also look at a lot of graphic designs - PDFs and flash animations.  I tend to run 5 or 6 apps at once, and I'm wireless frequently.  I come from a nearly 3 year old HP DM-3, which had treated me well.  But it's getting long in the tooth, and the battery is losing a lot of juice.  I often dock my computer at the office to 2 monitors and use a wireless keyboard and mouse. (These things will have a bearing on my review later)So, I narrowed down my selection to 3 computers - the ASUS Zenbook, The HP Envy Spectre XT, Toshiba z935.  The ASUS won for me for a few reasons.  First, the reviews said battery was good - the Engadget, CNET and PCMags of the world overall seemed to put it in the B to B+ range, with one exception.  That was maybe not as good as the Toshiba, but probably better than the HP.  I might have gone for the Toshiba, but it appeared to be out of stock in a lot of places.  I liked its connectivity/port selection, but didn't like the purported flimsiness.  And it didn't come with a 256 GB SSD option.  The HP looked like a winner, until I read that there was only one video out port.  I need 2 - both HDMI and VGA.  I considered getting a USB to VGA adapter, but after reading a lot of reviews this appeared to not give great video viewing.  So, the ASUS won because of its connectivity and its great build quality, and because it offered a 256 gb option.What I didn't really factor in was the superior screen on the ASUS.  Reviewers were really agog about the display.  In my mind, how good could it be?  I don't really watch a lot of video on my laptop, so it wasn't a big deal, in my mind.  And better viewing angles weren't a big deal - aren't they all pretty bad?  After one day, I can tell you that the display is a total game changer.It's incredibly bright, and since the screen is not reflective, everything looks better - almost no glare.  But the viewing angles really are amazing.  If I'm cramped on some plane and the person in front of me reclines, I know I will be able to see the screen clearly, even when it's halfway closed.  It's that good!  SOOOO much better than my current HP or even most of what I saw at retail.  It's a huge difference, even if you don't really care much about the screen.  It's a lot easier on the eyes.Other comments - the trackpad has been generally very good.  Read a lot of reviews about problems, but I'm not having any.  The only advice I have is that you need to get used to the pad being super sensitive.  it doesn't respond well if you really press down.  You need a feather-light touch, at least out of the box.  I may adjust this a bit, as I have had a few problems brushing the trackpad as I type.  But nothing insurmountable by any stretch of the imagination.  BTW - the keyboard is really nice.  Key travel is very responsive - I'm not missing keys, and the backlight is a nice touch.And the build quality is sick.  Just sick.  It's so damn sexy!  Light but solid, and the hinge is very strong.  The brushed metal surfaces are amazing and it just feels amazing in your hands and when you use it.I really am glad I went with the 256 gb ssd.  Re-boot is very fast, just as promised.As for the speakers, I found them just fine.  Not a big thing for me.  I don't expect my laptop to rock the world, but for some occasional music or audio it's quite clear and respectably loud.I'll update after a few days to give more insights, but this is clearly love at first sight for me.", "Date": "December 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Severely wounded on arrival but ASUS fixed it", "Author": "David L.

REV 1 - Contacted supplier Adorama - their return policy was NOT posted on AMAZON (lesson learned - always go to the vendor site and view return policy if not posted).  The BIG print on their web site site says \"EASY EXTENDED RETURNS\".  The fine print says they won't accept return of opened notebooks.

REV 2 - OK the PC shipped on Dec 5 using the ASUS emailed barcode to authorize/print a no charge return shipping label.  The ASUS ADW (Accidental Damage Warranty) says \"Target 3 business days turnaround time for repair/replacement, not including receiving and shipping time\".  Sounds good doesn't it?  Well, FEDEX tracking says \"Standard Shipping\" will deliver my PC on Dec 10 (+5 days shipping time), so add 3 days turnaround (hopefully), plus 5? days return - that means I'm without my brand new PC for 13 days, and I haven't even used it yet.

Just include a filled out Return Merchandise form along with a copy of the original packing slip.\"  Sounds good doesn't it?  Later the email says \"All returns must meet our return guidelines.\"  Uhhh - the return guidelines state they won't accept return of opened notebooks.

The screen is absolutely gorgeous, and I opted for the UX31A for the screen alone. The 1080p IPS screen is what sets it from the rest of the competitors. Unfortunately, there seems to be some sort of design flaw - which I suspect comes from attempting to undercut other laptops in the weight department.Your screen will bleed. If you're fortunate enough to not receiving a machine with a bleeding screen, it will develop after traveling with it. Along the edges of the screen, various pressure levels can cause screen bleeding. I can only speculate that since there is no glass between the bezel and screen, that pressure from the bezel transfers to the screen and causes bleeding.Honestly though, it is a great machine. The bleeding is not noticeable on anything but a dark screen. For me, if I rank it a premium product, I need it to be as close as acceptably flawless as possible. Being reminded of the screen every time I start my computer or watch a movie... is unacceptable to me.That is why I left out only one star. The screen is an issue.

The biggest flaw I discovered in the weeks following my first impressions review was that my touchpad drivers were messed up; as a writer I like to disable the touchpad and use a travel mouse so my hands do not move the cursor by accident. This functionality *should* have worked from the start (there's a hotkey) but it didn't. I ran the Asus LiveUpdate utility and voila, the new drivers fixed my issue. With my singular grievance addressed, I give it 5 stars.----------------------------------I received my Zenbook yesterday evening. Nice fast shipping, Amazon! The packaging and presentation are sexy; the laptop itself is absolutely gorgeous, and weighs next to nothing. Everything worked out of the box and the setup and warranty registration was simple.Aesthetics: 5/5I usually prefer glossy screens, but the matte screen on this laptop is just fine. The resolution is high; some people will not enjoy how tiny the text is. I like it, but to each their own. The keys feel great when typed on. Comes with a nice faux leather sleeve too.Hardware: 4/5I'm not sure if I'm just remedial when it comes to trackpads, but I really don't like using them. That being said, the trackpad works quite well so far! The camera takes nice quality pictures/video. I haven't figured out how to configure either the trackpad or camera yet, but I haven't really dug too deep either. The ports all work, keyboard is great. The only reason I give it a 4/5 is because I really don't like the tap-to-click feature of the trackpad, and would like to turn it off. Also, the manual says it recognizes several gestures (such as scrolling) that I have yet to get working on any website.Performance: 5/5I bought the db-51 model because I didn't really need dedicated graphics; I have my desktop pc for gaming. When I'm away though, I was hoping to be able to play some low-end games on it. So far I have Minecraft and League of Legends running at ~40fps on their low/lowest settings, which I am happy about.

I've gotten used to lifting my hands slightly while typing due to my previous laptop (Toshiba Satellite L305D), so I almost never accidentally touch the track pad while typing. There are some kinks with multi-touch, but it's probably the best on a PC that I know of. It's also huge, which helps since the resolution on this thing makes your screen space huge. Going back to a smaller standard touch pad is weird for me now.The keyboard is nice and the aluminum casing looks really sleek. I get annoyed with I get stuff on it so I'm constantly wiping things off, but regardless, it's been keeping its shine for the past 4 months and I expect it to continue for awhile.Also love the battery life on this. At the very least, I get 6+ hours, but I've been using this laptop all day recently, so it probably takes two charges to get through the day (life of a computer science student!). I've noticed that screen brightness has a considerable impact on battery life, but even the lowest setting for brightness is not bad, I just sometimes like to up the brightness.Audio through the speakers aren't amazing, but I use headphones most of the time anyway and don't have much use for blasting sound, so not really any complaints here.VGA port would have been nice, but adapter that came with the laptop works great. Haven't tried the HDMI yet, since the mini-HDMI adapter doesn't come with the laptop and I don't have anything to try with it at the moment =( Although I can imagine that it would be amazing.I noticed that the fan randomly turns on sometimes after a friend with the same laptop told me about it. Apparently there's a BIOS fix for it, but haven't bothered with that yet.I'm planning on either trying out Windows 8 or switching to Linux soon.

The top cover with its circular metalic design is subtly eye catching.  The interior is understated and sleek. The screen is absolutely brilliant.  Blacks have incredible depth, greens pop, and the brightness is beautiful.  The keyboard has relatively short, well-spaced keys that provide comfortable feedback. Despite being a small machine, the keyboard is well-spaced and comfortable to type on.  The backlight feature isn't terribly important to me, but is a nice touch.  The trackpad is quite large, but is overly sensitive.  I've found that the smart gestures don't work perfectly and I accidentally swipe across the trackpad while typing.  I've been impressed with the machine's speed and reaction.  For instance, I'm playing a 1080p video, have Microsoft Word open, and am downloading Symantec while writing this review and each program is silky smooth.

The degree of the bleeding differs, but you can clearly see them after you choose background as a black solid color(or during windows starting screen,) and on the bottom the bleeding looks periodic. There are some videos on the Youtube well-demonstrated the issue.I ordered two UX31A-db51 unit. The one ordered earlier comes with the ADATA drive, so even if it has some light bleeding, my wife kept it. The second one and the replacement both have ScanDisk drive, which is noticeable slower(you can count the booting time.) Also, they both have similar light bleeding, especially the placement one has a even more serious light bleeding. I noticed that the ADATA one needs a BIOS update, which indicates it is an earlier made version? The windows experience score for drive is 7.9 vs 7.5, but don't take that too seriously.As for Amazon Customer Service, they are nice in general, but handled the whole replacement/changing address thing in a chaos. Also, after the first replacement, they refused to do the second but changed it into a refund. (BTW, the gift card goes with the deal cannot be refund, so you will only get the deducted money.)I don't know if that is their internal policy or what. I do write to them to explain the whole situation and my concerns in detail, asking if I can get a second replacement. However, I heard no response so far (two days so far.)Hmmm, guess that's it.If you read through the 300 page forum and countless reviews online as I do, you will find that most of the Zenbook Prime have the light bleeding issue. It is just the degree of bleeding and whether you can live with it. In general, it won't get better with time - it just that if you lower the brightness, it will be less obvious; also, after long enough time, the backlight will gradually lose its intensity; or, you just get used to it, as many other people do.It is still the best ultrabook(great c/p) you can buy.

The aluminum body is well-crafted, feels strong, and yet is quite light. The concentric circles on the lid of the laptop are pleasing to the eye, and really add to the \"zen\" feel of the machine.The very first thing I did when I unboxed this puppy was install Debian 7 over Windows 7, so my review will reflect my experience with Linux on this machine, and will not include any information about how this machine works with Windows.That being said, the Linux install went fairly smoothly. I had already set up my USB drive with the Debian image, so I just popped that in and away it went.The hardware support for Debian is quite good. Everything worked as expected, except for the track pad. I can click, and have two-finger scrolling, but no other multitouch support or right-click capabilities. This means that clicking and dragging files can't be done in the typical way; instead you have to click, hold the track pad button down, and slide your finger across the track pad. It's rather awkward, so I use the terminal or a small USB mouse for any real work, and just limit the track pad to leisurely browsing of the Web. Right click can be accomplished with a menu button between the right alt and ctrl keys.The keyboard is great. The keys are nicely spaced and of an appropriate size. I can churn out text as fast as I can on any other keyboard, and it wasn't hard to get used to at all. The back-lit keys are aesthetically pleasing, and work well in low-light conditions. I have the machine configured to ignore track pad input while typing, and it mitigates the problem of having your palm incidentally brush against the track pad, causing the odd behavior others have reported. It seems to work reasonably well, and I have no serious complaints.That being said, the only reason that the Zenbook achieves a score of 4 stars is because of the limited trackpad support in Linux, and the shortage of USB ports. Two USB ports isn't quite enough for me, and after inspecting the case, it appears that there could have been more ports included. I feel like these are fairly minor problems, and otherwise the machine has been great so far.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "I try to buy, and the results give me the result!", "Author": "zhouji", "ReviewID": "R19IZ4FQZ9HGS3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Arrival, the computer has no sound, never buy! ! !

I needed laptop that would impress my business partners (yes in some countries appearance is important... like Russia) it arrived one day before my departure. I left without turning it on hoping that first one was just a lemon and this time everything will be smooth. Was I wrong!When I arrived to Russia and finally turned it on I screamed, the screen had this weird nebula/milky way looking defect (kind of like our galaxy of you look at it from the side, just google image search \"milky way infrared\" and it looks exactly like that). The defect is about 4 inches long and 1/2 inch wide almost in the middle of the screen. It is visible only when laptop is on and REALLY stands out on darker background (if connected to external monitor the defect is not visible). Out of respect to my business partners I decided not use ZenBook for presentation purposes and had to buy another laptop in Russia at great expense and put ZenBook back in the suitcase. I was MAD!My trip was 3 months so I could not return it back to Amazon. Now I'm back in the US and decided to start using the ZenBook with external monitor. Hooked it up and 10 minutes latter I'm writing this review.As in my older review of UX31A-AB71, UX31A-DB51 had same problems and more.Of course Trackpad/Touchpad is horrible and is still unusable even after the updates. ( External mouse helps)Video play back for files on hard drive is horrible and jerky as if I'm plying it over the network on super old laptop with no memory and cheap video card. VERY frustrating and is not acceptable.Physical memory is always running at 70-80% from the start I guess due to all the Asus junk applications and services.And of course it still wobbles on marble table it still rocks back and forth just enough to start hating it.WiFi is unusable, it is on and connected, but the speed is about 0.05 Mbps  where as the rest of my computers are running via WiFi at 5Mbps as they should.I'm furious, but not sure what to do. Window of opportunity to return it back to Amazon has passed, but I really do not want this brick in my house. Do any of you have an advice on what I can do?

The screen is absolutely the best on the planet at its size class and it has no more \"backlight bleed\" than any other bright IPS screen.  You don't see it except on the Windows Splash screen, which doesn't have a rendered colored background, more like a \"screen\" over the backlight.  I have owned numerous notebook with very bright IPS and non-IPS screens (Sony Zs, HP Envy Radiance, Samung S900X3C) and this runs circles around all of them and has the same \"bleed\" they do, none of which shows up when rendered color backgrounds, including \"true\" black, are on the screen.  Asus did have quality control problems but latter production models - especially the new touchscreen versions - have had few to no operating problems out of the box and after some driver updates.  Moreover, their support has improved greatly and they have a department set up just to take customer complaints and repair delay issues.The only reason I dinged it a fifth star is that I believe a high quality product should not need software updates out of the box just to be usable.

I'll buy an external wifi adapter if I have to (which would be ridiculous).Asus - get it fixed ASAP before everybody sees these reviews and I'll change my rating!UPDATE 7/22/12:I'm returning this.  Still haven't had any luck with wireless even after assistance from both Asus and Charter (my ISP).  Then, something new happened that made me even madder: The unit shut down unexpectedly.  Really??? This is a $1300 computer.  I'm never buying Asus again.

Apple recently patented the ultrabook wedge shaped style that this beautiful zenbook takes advantage of. I don't like apple computers or the OS X platform, which is why I waited for this ASUS, unfortunately, it's worth noting for those \"would-be-buyers\" that the patent Apple has now on the design has made it legal for apple to ravish ASUS for this book, meaning it could come off the market soon as Apple is using it's newfound power to take action against it's competitors already.

Yes, it was enabled.  Yes I typed the network password in correctly.  Yes, I tested the access point with other devices, and it was good.  But nothing helped this poor Zenbook.  The thing just could not get packets in or out of its wifi card.Other than that it's a nice laptop.  The screen sure is incredible.
