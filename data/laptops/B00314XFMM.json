{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Beware of swapped key locations - Fn and Ctrl", "Author": "Dan D \"I've done my homework\"", "ReviewID": "R2GCS2AH9K6CAT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Just wanted to mention the swapped Fn and Ctrl keys. Why Lenovo chose this keyboard layout is a mystery, given that all other laptops have Ctrl where you'd expect it - in the lower left corner of the keyboard. Users have been complaining for years (just Google \"Lenovo Fn Ctrl\"), but Lenovo only very recently provided a BIOS option to switch the keys. This means you will press the \"Ctrl\" key and get the \"Fn\" function, and vice-versa. So visually confusing but haptically as you're used to.This may seem like a little thing, but I had a Lenovo with this issue for 9 monhts and I still do Fn+C when I think \"Ctrl+C\". Unless this will be the only computer you'll mainly use, prepare to get annoyed by this keyboard layout oddity.", "Date": "November 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Capability", "Author": "Ara Bagdasarian", "ReviewID": "R3OKE8G8Z1SZY9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For a $1900, it should have a bluray R or better yet a RW BD drive", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00314XFMM"}}
