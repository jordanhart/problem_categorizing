And it has turned out to be the worst investment I have ever made.  From now on I will never buy another dell laptop (or product) again.This \"thing\" is so cheaply made is  hilariously sad. It to only is cheaply made but it shows it in every piece of material and features.  Besides the disaster that is windows 8, which is volumes of horrible on its own, why should a laptop act like a tablet? I like my iPad, I like my (old) laptop. I hate windows 8.  And shame on dell for putting it on the \"thing.\"Problems after problems when you want to use it.  On the Internet? Not for long.  While all our other laptops at home consistently stay on the Internet for hours at a time, this one disconnects at random.  Tell it to automatically detect! Sure, time after time after time.  Have a printer? Say a two year old dell wireless printer?bdoesnt like it.  The drivers are unavailable for it. After digging for hours on dells website I found a patch that allows it to intermittently work but the headache remains.Oh and let's see I've had it a month, no, almost three weeks and already it has told me the drivers have issues and cannot be repaired.  It's so \"great\" to use the wizard to fix it because not only does it each time find a different solution, but none of them work, ending with e screen, \"ask a friend.\" Wow, glad that is the best help dell can offer is to phone a friend on a device that is three weeks old.I have no confidence in this product or in future products.  Each time I open it and attempt to use it, because I am stuck with it, I only get more mad at each new faulty glitch.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Returned Dell Inspiron 11R-1053s LV Laptop", "Author": "Lawrence Farlow", "ReviewID": "R34E9FUNMQE5JV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I could not make it work.
