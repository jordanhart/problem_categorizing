{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Nice", "Author": "D. Flaws", "ReviewID": "R2KU5RH2NY4Q7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a bit of research and this laptop seemed pretty highly anticipated by those looking to buy and well received by the few that already had them.  I also saw that it seemed most of the initial shipment came with 1333MHz DDR3 ram instead of 1066.  I opened mine up and it does have 1333MHz.  A supply issue I guess. Very nice considering it's a $150+ upgrade on some websites.I installed Borderlands and it seemed like a dog at first, then I realized I didn't have the AC adapter plugged in.  It automatically goes to a power saver mode when only on battery (of course) and it makes a big difference.  Once plugged in I put all the settings on high except for anti-aliasing at 4 instead of 16 and resolution at native 1920x1080 it ran a little slow.  Frame rate was around 30 usually. Fine for most games but not a FPS.  At 1280x720 the frame rate was in the 50s.  I played for about an hour and it was running very hot so I stopped for a while.  I bought this laptop to replace an older Dell laptop I had because I burned out the vid card on the Dell, so I was a bit worried, maybe needlessly.The keyboard is fine but the keys are real slippery, could use some kind of texture or concave shape.  They are lighted which will be very useful (hit Fn+F4 when you 1st get it, mine were turned off).Could use a USB in the back (I like to use a cooling pad) but it has 2 on each side near the front which is nice.Lights on the lid are annoying.  The side ones turn off in battery mode, I'll have to look into a setting to turn them off all the time.  The logo light in the center of the lid never turns off.I like the physical switch for wireless and bluetooth.No dead pixels, I'll be looking close for 30 days but I hope to not have to RMA.  Nice warranties on this thing, definitely a selling point.  Watch out if you try to buy an ASUS from Best Buy --they do not honor all the standard ASUS warranties, I think the accident insurance.  Because Best Buy wants to sell you their own insurance for $179.The thing I don't like the most about this laptop is the screen size.  Not the resolution but the actual physical size.  There is approximately a 3/4 inch bezel on the sides and bottom and nearly 1 1/4 inch at the top.  This makes the laptop less attractive visually also, like it's chunky and thick. The large top bezel is likely because of the webcam which I will never use.  The screen could easily be 16+ inches which would help lots with the high resolution.  At 1920x1080 for a laptop you need all the size you can get.  Text at 100% is tiny but mine shipped at 125% so that's smart on their part.  I primarily use it for painting in Photoshop and Painter so the high resolution is great.  Trying to show someone text on the screen is difficult when they can't read it unless they are real close.One other thing I didn't like was 40+GB of pre-installed software.  Why anyone would want all this crap is beyond me.  I was going to wipe and reinstall but there is the quick start OS which I need to look into and see if that will be wiped and if there is any difficulty reinstalling it. I pretty much always plan on wiping a new computer but most people wouldn't so that is a factor.I got my backpack and mouse, I see some others didn't.Oh yeah it's not black, even the darkest part of the lid is a dark blue.So:+Free ram upgrade+speedy+lighted keys+wireless switch+free backpack and mouse-slippery keys-physical screen size-bloatwareAll in all very happy with it.", "Date": "February 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid, Awesome performance", "Author": "D.

EAX sound is amazing:  even sounds decent out of the built-in speakers (really rocks with my headphones though).  CPU performance and multitasking is sweet and responsive.  I have multi-surfed Word, Visual Studio and Photoshop CS with no lag or issues.More ports than you can shake a stick at:  plenty of USB, eSATA, FireWire (1394) and even HDMI (which outputs to full 1080p if that floats your boat).  Bluetooth devices are easily paired.  Amazing Windows 7 performance (rates a 5.9 Windows Experience out of the box, with 6.6s in graphics, before any tweaking)This thing is a sweet PC for money.Cons:  Runs hot.  Be sure to keep side vents for cooling free.  Might be worth investing in a cooling mat for this bad boy.

I don't use my computers unplugged very often at all, so battery life isn't a big issue.  I was a bit timid about buying another Asus since my last one was defective, but the 2 year warranty made me feel better about taking a chance on this model. This may tell how long it's been since I bought a laptop but it was common to see 2 year warranties and frankly I'm surprised that not all the Asus models offer this coverage. To be fair, I give this laptop 4.5 stars, being dinged primarily for going \"cheap\" with the OS choice.Gripes:Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium for a \"high end\" gaming platform just doesn't make sense. I was expecting, at a minimum, the Professional version at this price point.  As an aside, nearly all my complaints are around Windows and the lack of it's ability to run many not-so-old applications that I depend on.  So be prepared to also drop some bucks on newer versions of programs that won't run on 7 that were perfect on XP. Also, approximately 100gb chunk of the 500gb hard drive is not available out of the box thanks to Microsoft's \"instant upgrade\" OS to Professional/Ultimate are already on the drive. I guess it's convenient for some to upgrade this way but I always insist on a Physical Disc for that day the hard drive craters. (Asus: It would be helpful if you offered instructions or an \"uninstall\" option to delete these files for those of us that want our hard drive space for our use), or maybe I should charge Microsoft rent?No Blu-ray. Ok, maybe I shouldn't list it as a gripe since I knew it didn't have this when I bought it, but seriously, why go through the hassle and expense of a true 1080p display and NOT have a drive to watch/load Bluray or HD titles??  I hope Asus will make a replacement drive available with Blu-ray/HD capability at a reasonable cost.  By the way, Microsoft did not think it important to support HD playback in Windows 7 (incredible blunder!) and as of this date I have not found a pre-installed application on this machine that will play Bluray/HD files! More $$$ for a program for that I guess.Speakers: The sound is best summed up as anemic. I was expecting much more from the Altec Lansing branding...while they sound ok (not great by any standard, as an audiophile), my biggest gripe is VERY LITTLE OUPUT AT MAX compared to my last HP notebook which would get loud enough to embarrass me!  No worries with this one in this regard, sadly. (Asus,I've gone through all the convoluted menus to try to tweak more output but I'm disappointed!). Not enough bass nor treble. . Perhaps I got a bad sound module??  At least the headphone output is quite good.The included bag, while appreciated, is just large enough to carry the laptop/power brick, mouse and few knick-knacks. It feels a bit on the cheap side compared to my other Targus bag. Perhaps it's easier on your back this way.  ;-)This is not really a gripe, just a \"heads up\": Heat! Under heavy load (or any graphics intensive operation) this puppy will pump out some BTU's! It's main exit vent is on the left side and I've found it quite handy for keeping my coffee HOT (not just warm!). This is almost a plus but I can see why Asus didn't want to advertise this. Just be careful for spillage. The heat is extreme enough under load that I worry about anything remotely flammable within a foot or so of the vent. Asus did a great job of keeping the heat off the keyboard and upper area (although it definitely will be welcome in the winter, keeping your hands warm while you type!). I have read that the Intel i7 chip is a HOT chip under load, so this is going to be \"normal\" if you run an i7 quad core, no matter who builds it. The i5 I had previous was also a hot machine, but the i7 is definitely hotter.What I like:The part of any laptop you look at the most and thus, in my opinion, the most important part, the display,is sharp and bright. Colors are natural and the \"Splendid\" application allows one to customize viewing almost limitlessly. Perhaps 1080p on a 15.6\" screen is a bit overkill, but I'm not complaining. I do find myself zooming in a lot though.Keyboard lighting is great and you can adjust the intensity (3 settings to choose from). The ergonomics is fair and I really love having a keypad on the keyboard. The keys feel a slight-bit on the \"cheap\" side but they work just fine. I say \"fair\" on the ergonomics since the edge of the palm rest tends to \"bite\" into my lower forearms after a few minutes. The top of this palm rest is coated with a \"rubbery\" layer which is comfortable enough but the edge is just a little too sharp for my tastes. This is not a big issue but I'm very thorough and critical of my big ticket items.Wireless: The best and most sensitive I've witnessed yet. I'm amazed at the range this laptop wireless has from the base station. Almost double anything I've used prior to.  Well done Asus!Bluetooth: I've had issues using Skype (about the only time I used the bluetooth) with it dropping my Plantronics headset after a few minutes in a session. It could be just Skype's software, I don't know. The headset works flawlessly for hours at a time with my Blackberry. Perhaps there is a conflict? I'm going to find out the problem and update when I do.Gaming/graphics capability: I consider myself a casual gamer but I've been VERY impressed with the frame-rate even at full 1920X1024 resolutions! Runs X3, Silent Hunter IV, Half-Life 2 with all options maxed no problem. (Heat! will be generated!) I will update on this as I try other games.  My main use for this power is TurboCAD as I do a LOT of design work and this machine flies through everything I throw at it.The included mouse is great! I've always used logitech mice but I think I found a new alternative. It isn't wireless (which would be even better) but it is a joy to use.The touchpad, while not the \"new\" style of the one on my other Asus, is much nicer to use. I HATE the multi-fingering gesturing and I MUCH prefer having a scroll bar like this one has. It also will auto-shut off when a mouse is attached (software option). This touchpad is great!I plan on doing a 90 day update so stay tuned.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic", "Author": "R.

Pierce", "ReviewID": "R1MC1IS6GLY35W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "On paper this machine seems to have it all.  However, there is one major issue - it completely shuts down in the middle of gaming.  When running COD MW2 the machine would make it about 5-10 minutes into the game and would then completely shut off as if someone had cut the power to the machine.  We tested this over and over with gaming as well as with several different stress testing tools (Furmark, etc.) The laptop did not shut down in every single instance, it happened about 50% of the time.  While running non CPU/GPU intensive apps we had no issues.  After making several calls to ASUS support, they could not determine the problem and wanted me to send the unit in for repair (after only having for 2 days).  Thankfully Amazon let me return the unit for a replacement.  However, we just received the replacement machine yesterday and are having the same exact problem with it!After doing some digging on the internet, it appears others have had the same problem and is a known issue with these laptops.  All indications point to the fact that either the CPU/GPU are getting too hot or the power supply itself is getting too hot and the machine completely shuts down.You may want to look at other options when considering this laptop - especially for gaming.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price.", "Author": "J.

This system is easily a match for high end gaming systems by alienware or voodoo pc, but at hundreds of dollars less.Pros:There are a plethora of ports on the laptop - 4 usb, 1 e-sata, 1 hdmi, and 1 firewire. Add the standard network jack and multi-card reader, and you can use almost any conceivable device on this.The display is gorgeous, with full 1080p resolution.There is plenty of power out of the box.

Once received, I quicly opened the box and this is what I found out about the laptop:The Pros:- It is fast. It ran all of the games I am owning with with ease (because of GTS 360M GPU, core i5, and lots of fast RAM, etc...)- True 1080p on a 15.6in monitor produces great picture quality; however, text can be a bit small (tips: do Ctrl + +sign in IE to increase the font size, vice versa Ctrl + -sign to reduce it).- 7200RPM hard drive. (The hard drive is the biggest bottleneck in laptop or any computer's performance for read and write, but this has 7200RPM, which is very good, boot up and shutdown time is great).- The material that made up the laptop case is good, the laptop feels sturdy.- Full keyboard with dedicated num pad and can light up in the dark helps with using it at night.- Audio sounds great (if you have a headset, plug it in and you will be able to hear the true sound quality of the built in sound engine.- Heat (to be fair, I have own laptops that are hotter than this one, and ones that are cooler than it, so the heat from this laptop is neutral in my opinion, neither hot or cool.The Cons:- For a 15.6in laptop it feels a litle bit bulky (ASUS could have reduce the height and width a bit)- The keys on the dedicated NUM pad are smaller than the normal keys (??? why, they certainly have spaces on the sides to make these normal-sized keys- the bezels around the lop are thick (again ??? why, they could have reduce half an inch off of each side and it will be perfect).Overall, this is a great laptop for the price; however, the GTS 360M is only a directx 10.1 GPU, now that Fermi is out, might as well wait for the mobile GPU from that architecture and upgrade.", "Date": "May 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "RMA'd after a week...", "Author": "Minez", "ReviewID": "R1T9MXXONK95SC", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I didn't purchase this through amazon, but I usually read amazon reviews when I make my purchasing decisions so I thought I would post my issues.For the good:  This is a very powerful gaming laptop.

I can tell you guys that this machine is fast responding, nice, comfortable; but heavy, large and has a short battery life. Let's get straight into details shall we?For Pros,It is truly a fast responding laptop as what I have mentioned above. Because it has 4 GB RAM plus 1 GB graphic card memory, it never gets stuck by almost any kind of multi-tasking. As soon as I unveiled the cover of this computer and lifted the screen up, the first lovely feature came into my mind was the wonderful keyboard. The design is following Apple Mac's keyboard, however, ASUS makes it even better! It is soft, confortable and smooth. So, it certainly fits for typing tasks and it can let you have a pleasant typing journey. The 15.6\" HD screen is amazing and clear, and unlike a lot of other laptops, it has the shortcut to turn off the light of the screen while leave the PC switching on. Since this machine also has LED light under the keyboard, you can actually turn off the screen light and turn on the keyboard light while you are sleeping. Therefore, you can also use this laptop as a fancy table light ^-^. Well, since we call it `Republic of Gamers', this machine should be good with gaming, right? YES! ABSOLUTELY! So far I have run extreme high definition of the online game-League of Legends and Call of Duty 5-World at War. Both of them run fairly well. Furthermore, the audio system is mad good, however, you might need a headphone to enjoy it better. Few more features about this device are the webcam, and the LED lights on the back and sides of the screen. I tried Skype video chat through the webcam of this laptop with my parents, and they told me they can see me better than while I was using my Macbook's webcam (never expected it before >.<). I don't know why some people say they dislike the LED lights on the back of the screen, ASUS actually learned from Apple (I think)! It is indeed the right and nice design!For Cons,I really don't want to say anything bad about this lovely machine considering the fairly low price of it. However, lol, I better tell the truth about the shortages of this ASUS product.First of all, it is heavy. Since it has 2 separated hard drives inside, each with capacity of 250 GB added up to 500 GB; the machine cannot be a light one. In addition, we have the huge 15.6\" HD screen. In order to be specific, I checked the weight of the G51jx series from the official website of ASUS, 3.30kg (7.28 pounds). Well, it is only the pure weight of the device. Considering that we have to bring the charger (which is a large and heavy one) with us almost all the time because this laptop's battery life is relatively short, it will actually weight up to around 4.2-4.5kg (9.3 - 9.9 pounds), which almost equals to the total weight of two 13.3\" laptops. We just can't expect it to be light, can we? Secondly, G51jx-X3 got extremely hot around the area of the side fan while I was playing games. Here, what I mean for `very hot' is that it can actually warm up a cup of cold water or `burn' your left hand. So, it helps a lot during winter that you can put a cup of tea or coffee next to the side fan and keep it warm while you are playing games ^^. Therefore, we need a good cooling pad to keep this machine running well and safely. Moreover, there are also complains about the inconvenient design of the keyboard that we almost need function shortcuts (press two keys at the same time) everywhere like turning up/off the volume, increasing/decreasing the background LED light of the screen, fast forward/rewind a music or movie.All in all, if you don't care about the heaviness, inconvenient shortcuts and short battery life of this machine, everything else works just fine. I can say this is really a brilliant and nice and satisfying laptop at this price.Thanks for reading and hope you will get the one you like.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Almost everything I expected", "Author": "T.

Also has DPI and frequency adjustment switches on the bottom.CONS:-Main hard disk size is small.  Only about 150GB.  Comes with extra 329GB hard drive, though, but I'd prefer my C: drive be larger.-It's thick and big.  This is technically a desktop replacement notebook, but everyone prefers a laptop be small.-Most everything has a 7.0+ Windows Experience rating (max is 7.9), but the hard drive has only 5.9.  A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.  I'm not entirely sure if the rating is low because of the disk size or the disk speed.Notes:-People have complained in reviews about the volume being really low.  Perhaps Asus improved this laptop recently, but the max volume is plenty loud.-The side vent gets very hot.  I'm not sure if this is more of indication that the system gets super hot or that the ventilation system Asus designed is super effective.-Despite there being a side vent, the bottom of the laptop does begin to heat up after a while's use.

Eat your heart out, Alienware. Because ASUS wins.I bought this a little over a month ago, and I have to say, this was the best purchase I have made in my entire life. I'm using this as a college laptop for a degree in Video Game Production. I have not yet met something this laptop can't handle. It runs NFS: Shift at full graphics and 2xAA @ 30FPS. It runs Crysis with almost all settings at High (not Very High) @ 20FS. I can run any game from before 2008 at high settings @ 60FPS+. I love this computer and it doesn't matter what I do to try and slow it down, but it just keeps running.Also, the design of the actual computer is very attractive. The logo on the back lights up and looks very nice. The keyboard is backlit and is very bright. The track pad is one of the nicest I've used on a laptop. It has tons of ports, too. 4 USB (3 of them are 2.0), eSATA, Firewire, HDMI, Mic, Headphone, and Line-out, LAN, and VGA.What really make this laptop stand out is the massive array of available features. One of my favorite included programs is Power4Gear. It's designed to adjust every aspect of your power settings, including overclocking the CPU. Most of the other included programs are useless, though. One of the other features included is ExpressGate, which is a quick mini-OS that boots up in just a few seconds. It's good if you just want to check something on the internet and nothing else.Audio quality is excellent with the built-in EAX 4.0 HD audio. When I'm playing Crysis, I now can hear small little things like a Korean soldier snapping a twig in the forest. In NFS: Shift, I can hear a car coming up behind me, and in older games like Age of Empires III, I can hear every single sound separately on the screen. However, these things are only true through headphones. Speaker volume on this computer leaves something to be desired. But that's to be expected on most laptops, anyway.The keyboard design is exactly as it should be. WASD are marked with arrows. The backlight keeps me from having to turn on a light to see it. The numberpad is just the right size. I use it whenever I'm doing school work and it does its job quite well. As with any laptop, Home, End, PgUp and PgDown are awkwardly placed. All of the Fn keys available are useful taking full advantage of the hardware. One of the most helpful Fn keys is the Power4Gear key, which instantly switches between power modes set with the program I mentioned above. There is also a key to disable the touchpad, which can be very helpful when typing.This laptop also comes with a mouse and backpack, neither of which are a cheap build quality. It comes with the Razer Abyssus, and a Targus backpack, rebranded with the RoG logo. It's hard for me to fit all of my school books into the backpack, but then again, it was included at no extra cost, so I don't complain. The mouse is an excellent mouse, normally selling for over $50. On the bottom are DPI and pollong switches, the max being 3500DPI and 1000Hz. It has a light-up logo on the top that is appealing, too.I would not suggest this computer for anoyone but gamers. Even on battery saving mode, and just casually browsing the internet (with throttled CPU, low display brightness, no backlit keyboard, no USB stuff plugged in), I get about 2 1/5 hours at most. You really shouldn't be using it off the plug very often if you want the best performance, anyway, as the CPU is throttled no matter what. It refuses to play anything with a decent framerate on battery.Here's the recap:Pros:- Runs anything you throw at it, no matter what- Great design, very attractive- 1080p monitor- Includes mouse and backpack- Excellent keyboard- Great audio- Includes some powerful features- Best laptop for the price, anywhere (this was written in 2010)- Plenty of portsCons:- Hot!- Heavy (about 7.5 pounds)- Speakers aren't very loud- Low battery lifeOverall, this is definitely worth the purchase. I would suggest this to any mobile gamer out there (who wants to impress their friends while they're at it).", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing Laptop but beware!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2IJSMFYA282ZD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Out of the box this laptop sucks. You can only run games for about 30 minutes before it crashes. That said there is an easy fix. All you have to do is download and install the 206 bios update (which is really easy with asus winflash) and you are good to go.  Once that is complete this is one of the most amazing laptops you can own for under $1500. Most games (excluding crysis lol) can be run on max settings without so much as a blink. I've run Borderlands, Just Cause 2, Alien Swarm, Mass Effect, etc on max settings with great frame rates. Everything looks absolutely beautiful with 1080 resolution on a 15.6 inch screen. The nvidia 360m does a fantastic job. If you have any interest in programing the i7 quadcore processor makes compiling lightning fast.  On a side note, this laptop is bigger than most 15 inchers.

Greifinger", "ReviewID": "R35KSJQ0857F8C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this unit because i wanted a laptop with High definition and good graphics.  Was originally going to spend about 800 or 900 on an acer but it took to long to come on the market.  Lucky me.  I spent the extra 300 or so and am very pleased I did.  This is a great unit for playing tv shows and videos in high definition.  Had this for a few weeks now and am very satisfied.  Have not exercised all the ports yet but was able to sync my pda with music on it and download my songs.  For some reason tho I'm hearing imperfections in the files when played, like skips and hesitations.  Not sure why.  Also noticed there was a built in microphone surrounding the built in videocam.  it will echo when you listen to audio thru the headset plug in.  But the mircophone was easy to turn off.  Materials used to make this machine include a fair amount of plastic but regardless it still feels solid and no problems with any parts coming loose etc.  It is a bit of a high maintenance unit.  You need to be cleaning the screen and the plastic fairly often but i'm sure this would be with any unit.  I bought a gelskin to protect the top of the laptop and that works great.  Will eventually be getting a protective coating for the screen as well.  People have mentioned this machine gets hot but for me its not so hot that i can't keep it on my lap or that i need to get a cooler.  But then I don't play alot of games so maybe that makes a difference.  I do love that there are tons of ports on this thing including an Expresscard slot which can be converted to any other type of port you can think of.  I will probably use it in part to create a scsi port since my scanner is scsi.  Will update my comment when i finally do this.  One thing people should be aware of is that this really isn't great for typists.  The chicklet keyboard is not for the speedy typist being that if you don't hit the keys solidly it might not show up on the screen.  But again, this isn't what this machine is primarily for.  But I did try the included speech recognition and that was pretty cool.  Takes a bit of time to get good at it but it might be what a person would want given the difficulties with typing on the keyboad.  Definitely alot of unit for the money and being that i love High definition its certainly delivers in that department.

So far, it seems like a solid, powerful machine, but not without little quirks that I haven't been able to find workarounds for.First, the pros:1. Impressive specs (you'd know about those already if you're reading the product reviews)2. Backlit keyboard, with 3 brightness levels3. Almost full-size keyboard with number pad, and lots of Fn key shortcuts4. LED backlit screen has decent viewing angles and is very bright5. The \"soft touch\" palm rest feels nice6. Freebies, and better warranty than any \"standard\" laptop warranty I've ever seenCons:1. My biggest beef with this laptop: its volume controls. First of all, I can't change the volume or mute/unmute with one hand. 3 of the LED indicators above the keyboard are also touch-sensitive buttons. They could have included volume controls there. Secondly, when the volume is at 0 and you press volume up, it goes straight to 12%. After that, it goes up in 6% increments. The only way to get finer control is to use your mouse on the volume icon in the system tray--a PITA if you're trying to watch something full-screen. I MUCH prefer the HDX16's dedicated volume slider, which does 2% increments.2. The touchpad buttons are stiff. They seem fine to me now, but they stressed my thumb when I first received the laptop. I must have gotten used to them, or they became softer with use. Either way, be warned.3. It runs kind of hot. This is not surprising, and it actually seems to manage heat a lot better than HP laptops in my experience. The keyboard, palm rest, touchpad, etc., all feel cool to the touch. However, the area around the side vent gets quite hot. It makes me wary to have any kind of food, beverage, pills, or things made of soft plastic/rubber on the left side of my laptop.4. I'm not a fan of the colors and LEDs on the lid. Too \"loud\" for my taste. I also find the whole \"Republic of Gamers\" thing rather silly, and am glad they at least had enough sense not to slap that text label on the backpack, or *too* prominently on the laptop lid. [Disclaimer: I'm not a gamer =P]5. The wireless card only supports up to half-N speeds (150 Mbps), and only in the 2.4 GHz band. I tried to find out what type of card it is before buying, but couldn't find anything as the model was quite new at the time. Anyway, it's an Atheros AR9285. I suspect it would be upgradeable, but if you want full 802.11n speeds and/or dual-band functionality, it's an extra cost you'll have to consider.6. Biggest, heaviest power brick ever. The thing weighs over 22 oz, twice as much as the HP HDX16t one. This is my first quad core/high-end GPU laptop, so maybe it's supposed to be a common thing, but it came as a surprise to me. FWIW, my boyfriend's Thinkpad W510 with an i7 and Nvidia Quadro GPU also came with a similarly huge power brick.Other thoughts:- Speakers weren't as good as I'm accustomed to (long-time HP customer here)- The screen could've easily been 16\" without increasing the size of the overall machine. The 15.6\" screen has a huge bezel on all sides.- Yes, my system also came with the upgraded 1333 MHz RAM, but I don't think I'm getting much of a performance boost, if any at all. Just maybe a slightly better resell value.

I have nothing to add regarding the exceptional performance except one thing: my X3 does not get hot. I don't do gameing so I don't push the GPU/CPU to radical 3D extremes. I'm a graphic artist and photographer so I work with 2D graphics programs, often with extremely large files so I push the GPU and memory speed as well as CPU a lot farther than average use. Nothing I've done has caused a major heat issue. It does put out some hot air at the fan port and gets very warm on the bottom left corner but nothing like described in some of the other reviews. It never gets uncomfortable. Every high end machine I've used has gotten hot and this one is no worse than most. Heat is not an issue for me.The cons are mostly obvious things like bulk, weight, the power brick, the flimsy and silly looking lid with even sillier looking lights that can't be turned off. There are however a few unforgivable and inconceivable design flaws. Assuming this machine, though reasonably priced is seriously intended to be a high end powerhouse, it has some explaining to do.Inconceivable cons:There is no second hard drive connection. This is probably the largest form factor notebook on the market today. It has a second hard drive bay that is open, uncluttered and fits a hard drive with no problem, it just has no sata interface to plug the drive into. Thus, you can't use an SSD for a boot drive. You can't run a raid or have a backup drive, you can't have two 7200rpm 500G's for an otherwise unattainable terabyte at 7200 rpm.The USB ports are poorly positioned at the front of the machine but what's worse is they are so close together you cannot put two flash drives next to each other (!!!). I have about ten flash drives laying around so i tried every possible combination and I could not get ANY combo to fit next to each other. This is absolutely embarrassing for ASUS and infuriating for owners of these machines. How long have we known how wide flash drives are? SanDisk Micro Cruzer drives are way too fat, Corsair Voyager Mini 4GB drives can only be forced in at an angle next to a SanDisk Micro. How could they make such a mistake in 2010?A terrible flaw for me but apparently not for others is the lighted keyboard. This has to be one of the best features of this machine but it's rendered almost useless by the terrible design. The keys are clear plastic except for the very top part where the character is. The result is you have to look almost straight down over the keyboard to use it. If you sit back even a little from the keyboard the led lights under the keys become directly visible and blot out the keys completely. Even if you hover directly over the keyboard the light bleed around each key makes it extremely hard to use. Imagine a bright white light surrounding each key on your keyboard, like a frame, and thus having to really concentrate on each key to see what it says. It's nice to have in a dark room but it could easily have been made outstanding instead of downright irritating.Now the obvious cons:The size, weight, the overall bulk of this machine is excessive. If this is the only way to make a gaming computer then ASUS should offer one of the other slim long battery life machines with a high res screen. Some of them have almost identical specs but only come in the stupid 1024x768 Wide resolution. This machine is the only way to get high res and it's also designed specifically to appeal to gamers. Thus the flames on the lid and the ridiculous lights in the lid which can only be turned off by unplugging and running on the battery (the logo stays lit even when on battery). The bulk and the huge power brick seem to be part of the \"image\" of a gamer's machine.The lid feels cheap and alarmingly un-protective of the gorgeous screen. It flexes way too much and feels like even a light accidental tap against a table could shatter the lid and possibly the screen behind it. Think thin plastic, like on a model car, with the same motif of flames in a glossy paint job.Open the lid and the inside is beautiful. Everything is pure black, a matte rubberized covering over the entire palm rest and the same covering on the keys. The screen is incredibly nice and the 1920x1080 res is a wonderful amount of real estate to work with. Text is a mite small but easy to adjust up if you need it. The only glaring intrusion into the darkness of the interior is the (again stupid looking) bright brushed metal surround of the touch pad. It even has horns to make it look menacing for the targeted demographic of gamers.As stated in other reviews the plastic frame around the screen is way too large, almost like they wanted to use the same part for 15,16 and 17 inch screens. It's huge and clunky looking. Being a glossy black plastic helps. The webcam is the best I've ever seen on a notebook, unfortunately I don't really care. One flaw is that it doesn't pivot so you must adjust your position in the camera by sitting in a higher chair or moving the screen so the display image is washed out. In my normal working position the webcam shows my face from the eyebrows up.Everything works well and the machine is very fast, very competent. I've had no problems with connectors or quality (except the lid) or any of the lockups mentioned in other reviews. It works well, weighs a ton and looks stupid.I would love to have bought one of ASUS' elegant machines. This one is a throwback retro design that mocks AlienWare and makes a deliberate pitch to an advertising concept of young gamers. Nothing wrong with that but there should be a high-res alternative for artists and power users and currently there isn't.If it sounds like I don't like the machine it's not true. I can live with the irritations but the three I mentioned first, no second HD, USB placement and the lighted keyboard really piss me off. They all should have been handled correctly. I wonder if the keyboard fiasco was intentional, thinking the excessive light pouring out around all the keys would turn on gamers. I can imagine the enormous heavy power brick being intentional too \"kids will love it because it's bigger than anyone else's\". Gamers are not that immature. It's like the marketing department was allowed to influence the design department in an unhealthy and insulting way (as is usual for marketing departments). ASUS builds great notebooks, among the best available imo, but this machine is targeted to such a slim market sector it demands another version that anyone could buy without feeling compromised in so many ways.ROG is hot, ASUS is hot, but this machine just looks silly.", "Date": "November 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Please read review before buying", "Author": "Gabe911", "ReviewID": "R1ZE06GGXH4EQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "2 minutes after I turned the laptop on,  I kept receiving error messages about the Geforce Kernel Mode Driver (version #) failing and recovering.

Not an absolute dealbreaker, but it's something that should be known before you buy.  This seems to happen with all Asus laptops, must be the way they wire their keyboards.As for the computer itself, most of the other reviews sum it up well, but my thoughts:+ Screen is beautiful.  1080p gives you a ton of space to work with, approximately twice as much as the standard 1366 x 768 screen on most 15\" laptops.+ Great video card for the price.  Expect to run most games in high/max settings, and even the most demanding games will usually run in mid/high if you're willing to turn the resolution down a bit.+ Asus accidental damage warranty/dead pixel policy is a nice safety net to have in case something happens, though it only has a one year warranty instead of two unlike some other ASUS laptops.+ Touchpad is smooth and easy to track on.+ Tons of ports; I haven't touched most of them but if you want to plug something in chances are you'll have no problem.+ Comfortable, backlit keyboard.  Some of the keys on the right side are a little squashed, though.- Bulky, hot while gaming, and has poor battery life, about 1.5 hours web surfing with maximum brightness.  Didn't try out any of the power saving applications.- Lots of bloatware; when starting up the computer had about 1.4 GB of memory in use, which means that around half a gig is being sucked up by stuff you probably don't need.  Strangely partitioned HD too.- Strangely wide bezel, which means that the laptop itself is probably a little bigger than your average 15\" screen laptop.  Could've been a 16\" without increasing the overall size.- Rubberized palm rest feels nice but gets greasy very, very quickly.Other thoughts:Speakers are about average for a laptop.In order to use the volume, brightness, and playback controls on the function keys, you need to hold down Fn, which is different from a lot of other laptops.  This could be a pro or a con, though personally I'm not a fan of having to press two buttons just to change the volume.The design and LEDs on the lid are a little flashy, though some might like it.Overall, if you're looking for a gaming laptop around $1000, this is a great choice.

So far I've played League of legends and Audiosurf both on the highest setting possible with practically no stuttering. The framerate in League of Legends stays at about a constant 50fps, however I did notice that while I tried playing winamp and LoL at the same time the game stuttered a little. This is no big deal, but it probably has to do with the 4GB of RAM, which can be upgraded to 8GB if desired.The laptop did come with a bunch of bloatware, but this was no biggie, I just went to this website ([...]) to find out what's safe to uninstall and what I should keep. I took me a couple of hours to get rid of all the unnecessary programs, and I did have to install some new drivers for the video card to play Audiosurf, but again, it's no big deal.The back of the screen panel lights up which looks kinda neat, but I don't really care about the looks as much as the performance. The keyboard also lights up with is nice for gaming in the dark. The keyboard is a little bit flimsy which may cause some problems in the future but I don't really think it will. I don't use the mousepad and I don't recommend you do because the buttons are kind of hard to push down, which could be annoying if your playing a game.The vent on the side of the laptop get's kinda warm, and I've read a few reviews about this laptop overheating, but the laptop comes with a program that lets you see your core temp, cpu speed, and cpu fan speed. It will also alert you if the temperature get's too hot.Overall I am very happy with this buy, it was definitely worth the money, the only laptop I would recommend more for the same price ($999.99) is the Asus G72GX-RBBX05 ([...]), which has a slightly better video card (an nVIDIA GeForce 260m as opposed to an nVIDIA GeForce 360m).

Things to notePros- Fast! Good processor and RAM speeds- Very aesthetically pleasing.

Imagine that! What dork buys a high powered gaming laptop expecting it to stay cool? Really? Get a cooling fan like a smart person and be glad you got this system for >$1000- Preloaded software is freaking annoying! I wanted to just do a fresh install but oh yeah that's right THEY DON'T SEND YOU THE INSTALLATION DISKS!!!

Asus build quality is amazing on this machine I have ran every old game as well as new games that I want to play on max which includes Far Cry 3 and this machine does the job. If you are looking for a older refurbished model gaming laptop this is one that I would recommend as it stands up to most new mainstream 600 to 800 dollar laptops in terms of performance and beats them up! I will say I dropped mine and it still works all that needed replacing was the front and back bezel for the monitor due to damage and just looking bad. Not a problem with the lcd screen has occurred even with a drop taken. I will say the battery life is terrible but when you buy a performance computer you learn to expect this. Honestly I work on computers for a living and also refurbish computers in any form factor and Asus gets an  A+ in build quality plus customer support.

I'll mention those at the end.Pros: - Good, above average build quality.  There's a nice rubber where the palm rests are. - Good keyboard.  If you are used to an Apple laptop keyboard this is very similar. - Great gaming performance.  Scores about 9200 in 3Dmark06. - Good CPU, even though its not the i7. - Great upgrade ability for a laptop.  You can replace the CPU if you want to upgrade to an i7 and you know what you're doing.  The GTS 360M is also removable, but as far as upgrading that, I do not know. - Mine came with Kingston DDR3 1333mhz ram. - Great screen!  If you think 1080p in a laptop is too much, you have to see it.  Every time I see lesser resolution laptops they don't look very good anymore. - Some people say that this gets hot, but in my opinion the heat vent system is very good.  The air coming out is hot but the bottom of the laptop and the keyboard do not get very hot, only warm.Cons: - There's a bit of bloatware.  Make sure you know what not to delete if you are going to try to delete a bunch of it, there are a few required but seemingly unneeded programs. - WiFi range isn't as good as some I've seen but im sure it can be improved by upgrading the card.  Don't get me wrong, it's still decent range though. - Speakers aren't the greatest.  They are reasonable except that they lack bass. - Battery life isn't the best.  You can get just over 2 hours if you lower the brightness and don't do anything intensive. - Freezing problems I will explain in detail belowREAD THIS IF YOU ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH FREEZING:My laptop would freeze at seemingly predictable times.  For example, at the end of a song conversion in iTunes or the end of the DVD rip using imgburn.  It also froze when my friends tried using omegle.  I read that UNINSTALLING THE REALTEK HD AUDIO DRIVER fixes the problem and sure enough, after doing that through the control panel there is no more freezing!  Don't worry about losing sound ability either, it will simply use the default microsoft audio after you restart the computer and let it install it's software the way it automatically does.  I realized that after it stopped freezing, that when it did freeze, it was when that program in question made a sound, so it makes sense that the Audio Driver was the problem.  I have heard of BSOD problems, but those were never a problem for me.  But if they do happen to you, It's possible that updating the BIOS will fix it.Overall, after fixing the freezing issue, this is a great laptop.  It will blow through most older games and everything released today will run, but you might have to lower the settings.

It's not commonly found so it makes these systems special.  If you think you don't need the screaming i7 processor, asus has a similarly equipped model for less than 1000 with a i5 processor.  I do avoid the models with the ATI chipset for graphics myself but they are out there.And for the techno-geek -- there is a secondary hard drive bay across from the primary hard drive.  Make sure you don't void your warranty getting in it. It's there on all of the  G50 models at my house any way and I have 3 different models 4 systems.IF you have to deal with Windows 7 this is the best performing laptop I've seen.

This model compares with $1500+ HP, Dell and Sony models (and most of those don't have a 1080P screen - don't be fooled by that 900P marketing garbage).  I saw a flyer (July 2010) for a $1999 Alienware (now a line of Dell) and this machine equaled or beat every spec on that machine.If there are any Linux enthusiasts out there, this is a great machine.  I got everything working (with some tweaking of course) under Ubuntu 10.04.  The backlit keyboard adjustments (Fn-F3/Fn-F4) required adding support for the ACPI commands that doesn't come with the OS.  I think the entire set of scripts (one for brightness Up and another for brightness Down) totaled less than 10 lines.  Webcam required installation of Cheese (or is it Cheeze?) photo booth but then worked flawlessly after that.  Even HDMI-out to TV/external monitor worked fine as long as you are using the proprietary Nvidia driver.Linux tip:  When you install Linux, format over the existing windows partition, but leave the recovery partition (I think its only about 20GB so you can spare that space anyway on a 500GB HDD).  That way if you upgrade in the future and want to resell the machine to someone who requires Windows, it'll be ready to go, factory clean.Final note:  Battery life could be better.  The reviews that say 90-120 minutes are accurate.  And it definitely runs hot when its working hard.  But check any temperature probe software and you'll see that CPU and GPU are both well below threshold (at least 100 degrees C if not more).", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Epic Fail", "Author": "Zachary Warren", "ReviewID": "R2FDW1IDWFJNN3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Do not buy this laptop or any Asus laptop for that matter.I would to remark that before I bought this laptop I respected Asus as high quality manufacturer of high end computer parts. I thought the specs were great and the price competitive.  However, since this purchase I have become extremely dissatisfied.Out of box, I had to do a bios update to avoid getting the good ol' blue screen every hour and I had to update my video card driver to play any program that would require something as nice as a GeForce GTS 360M. I was surprised to find any computer sold in such an unstable state. More to the point, the bezel on the camera came loose starting to split the top of the laptop apart after ordinary daily use. This was the cause for my first RMA. Then, I come to find out I have to pay shipping and insurance for Asus to honor a warranty on their faulty product. I found this unacceptable on a product that cost well over a thousand dollars.  I went and complained on their site and they decided to pay for my shipping for my second RMA.  The screen started having bright spots on it.  They replaced the LCD panel.  After this the monitor went out entirely.  This is the third RMA.  At this point I started saving the box and packing they send it so I can send back without having to scrounge around for packing. Now the HDMI port will not send a signal.  RMA number four.  They were not able to fix the laptop's HDMI problem.At this point Asus decided to send me a different refurbished G51jx laptop.  Again, after using this for only a little bit the camera bezel came loose again and the HDMI port did not work.  This would be the fifth RMA. Finally, I am now on my sixth RMA.  Right now, the laptop can't stop switching between AC and battery power,  the speakers have become practically inaudible at full volume, and when I'm doing something as mundane as checking email it will unpredictably spaz out.  The screen will do a crazy tie-dye rainbow thing, I have no idea how else to describe it, and the laptop will crash.  Buyers beware!!!My G51jx faults listed in chronological order:1. Bad bios2. Bad video card driver3. Loose camera bezel4. Bright spots on LCD5. LCD failure6. HDMI port failure7. Loose camera bezel part II8. HDMI port failure part II9. Power supply issues10. Speaker volume issues11. Tie-dye rainbow crashesAsus is not willing to do very much for the end user.  They would prefer to do half way fixes on an inferior product and wait till the warranty runs out.  If they can't fix the problem properly they ask to \"recover the operating system.\"  This means they do a wipe and make you start from scratch.

Riddled with problems.", "Author": "W. freeman", "ReviewID": "RGDQZSG14KJ43", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned several different versions of Asus laptops since 2008 and had nothing but problems with every single one. It's true that when you put a lot of high tech performance parts in such a small package that your going to run into issues. This is NOT a desktop that you can just play all day, buy cooling systems for it, replace this, replace that. These machines just aren't made for hour upon hour of gaming. Also the BSOD happened on every Asus i ever had. I work on computers and have never had so many problems with one brand. The only one i liked that lasted the longest(but still had small issues) was the G71 model. Other than the fore mentioned they have, DVD-malfunctions, won't read or burn discs. Had 4(that went back for wireless and no mouse pad response issues). Other quirky things including some issues that may have not been the computers fault (human, or packaging error) were, smashed down or unresponsive keys. Very common. The web cam on the first i ever bought was very bad and ended up having lines going through it, or just not working at all. So do i hate Asus, well no i commend them for their efforts and they make solid built machines, but they really need to pay closer attention to the users and the issues they have with these machines.The vast improvements that were suppose to be rectified in the G73 never happened, i bought one last year when they appeared at BB, and wow what a mess. Overheated, even with the new venting system in the back. The screen was barely bright enough to even recommend, or say it was an LED, it just looked horrible. Also that model had what's called the dreaded grey screen of death due to the ATI card, and new drivers and a patch had to be issued. My advice is stick with desktop if you want the true hardcore gaming experience, if not i would go with Toshiba Qosmios, or Alienware. Will you run into problems with these laptops as well? Sure, but i'll be not nearly as many as with Asus. I actually stick with Acer, the underdog, they have no gaming laptops, but i don't use mine for that, and it runs flawless, along with Emachines, whom Acer bought out. I also have an Acer gaming rig that hasn't had the slightest issue, it's big, well vented and runs like a beast.So while you may not think i'm reviewing this model computer i am, mine just had the older Duo Core processor and the GTX 260 card which on paper is slightly even more powerful than the GTX 360 on paper. After having it(same color, body, everything) i can tell you i don't need to own this one just because it has an I7, because the processor isn't the problem. It's a design flaw, or many that keep these computers from being a reliable gaming laptop. Until these are fixed(if ever), well stick with the big boy desktop. Funny Asus is(was) rated number one for reliability, makes you wonder who makes those comparisons. Maybe the budget laptops, but not these.ALSO ANOTHER NOTE: Many PC games out there still have compatibility issues with Laptops GPUS. Read box before buying one.

I won't waste time, you already know the pros (super fast, great graphics, lit-up keyboard, etc, etc.)The only downsides I have with the laptop are the very quiet speakers.  Depending on what you're listening too, you might have to get close to listen, even when the volume is all the way up! The speakers are also in a strange position, instead of being at the end near the front of the laptop, they are right next to the monitor.  My old Dell laptop speakers could blow these speakers out of the water. But I guess everything couldn't be perfect, which is why I'm giving this laptop 4 stars out of 5.  I suggest you get some external speakers for this bad boy.  My laptop came with a cooling pad, but I can tell, just from watching a movie, that if it were not for the cooling pad this monster would get hot.  So invest in one :)  I suggest a logitech N100 cooling pad.  It does the job and is very quiet.  The chiclet keyboard is very different from what i'm used to, but it's no big issue.  I've already gotten used to using it.My last gripe, though this isn't Asus' fault, is I can't install Ubuntu linux on this computer, because it's not compatible with the graphics card, (It must be too much for it :P)  With all that said, this is overall a fantastic purchase.

I do look forward to this feature in the winter, as it'll help warm the room.

I am a casual gamer and the games that I play are not exactly a heavy load on a gaming laptop. The review is based on my experiencewith this and previous three laptops that I have used.I will not go in details with all the good things others have said and will mostly try to focus on what I think is either bad or not so great with thislaptop. As mentioned by others, it is a very fast laptop.  Yes it is big and heavy, but compared to other laptops I have seen of the same size, it is notthat heavy. My Vostro 15\" is barely lighter than this and it seems much smaller in overall size. I think the reason this laptop is huge because of the boardand since the size is big, the 15\" screen did not take all the space; one reason why people are saying there is too much space around the screen. And yes,the charger feels and weighs like a brick.The bloatware is not much and only took me about 20 minutes to get rid of all the games and unnecessary software but updating Windows patches took about 3hours.  Although that has nothing to do with the laptop itself.  I have not tried any of the helpful software (burner, data encrypter, etc) so cannot saymuch about that.As I said, it is somewhat of a big laptop and you would think there is plenty of space for ports but there isnt. There are four USB ports and I can only usetwo of them at a time.  I know USB ports on most laptops are close but you would think this giant will have enough space, it does not. Also as a right handuser, I keep hitting my mouse in the headphone port.  Another issue is where the DVD bay is located.  Often times while lifting the laptop, I have accidentlyhit and I fear I will break it. It is too close to the upper corner.The keyboard only looks bigger but I am still getting used to typing on it.  Some people have said the awkward number pad.  My complaint about both thenumber pad AND the arrow keys is the lack of dash or bump which you see on F and J key.  It is somewhat frustating trying to find them without looking while playing. It wont be an issue if you don't use arrow keys but if like me you keep jumping between number at top and arrow keys, you are boudn to hit wrong keys.I know the Webcam is 2.0MP but the small video I have taken is horrible. They could have just remove it and take a few dollars of the retail price.  The speakers arent that great as well.  The voice quality from my 3 yrs old Vostro feels much better than this which also has Altec Lansing speakers. It is possible that I have to play around with audio settings but at default, shipped settings, the audio sounds cheap (based on both YouTube and HD/SD movie files that I have watched).And now the worst part: People who said buying a cooling pad would be good idea are partially wrong. It is a must if you do not use both external mouse and keyboard. The most GPU hungry game that I play is probably World of Warcraft as most other games are old.  I play WoW at mostly mid-high settings with GPU hungry features (the one that increase decrease performance) definitely set at mid level. The laptop still heats up so much that I cannot even touch it. The entire body left of mousepad overheats and I use two thick, folded paper towels to shield my palm and wrist. The right side remains cool though. I will clarify that I am in the basement and it is very cool here, and laptop sits on a cool surface with nothing blocking the vents. I know it is a gaming laptop and games put a lot of load on GPUs but laptop becoming useless during game play is unacceptable in my opinion. I have not gotten the time to research and invest in a good cooling pad and may be that will solve the problem. Nonetheless, heating issue should not be severe.Overall, a fast and somewhat bulky laptop with a few flaws that ASUS can easily fix (add bumps on keys, put some kind of shield so the entire laptop is safe and not just the right side from heat, make best use of all the space for ports/peripherals, etc). The A1 model is not supposed to come with a bag even though some people gave it a bad review because of that but I think it should be included as it will not fit in any 15\" sleeve and most 16\" sleeve.  I have a 17\" messenger bag but that puts a lot of weight on one shoulder.  Considering the odd size, bag should be included or at least bundle it at a cheap price.UPDATE: After using it for a little over a year: Heat as mentioned above is still the same issue but it has not gotten worst.  It is painfully annoying when programming in IDEs as I keep pressing the wrong buttons when using the arrow keys.  Another annoying bug, which forced me to knock a star off this laptop, is that every now and then, if I plug the laptop in or out while it is running causes it to freeze.  I mostly keep that in mind but sometimes I end up making that mistake, just like a few minutes ago. This issue caused me to lose my entire PDF application which I had been working on for the past 1.5 hours.

I occasionally play World of Warcraft and no matter where I am, I get anywhere from 45 to 72 fps. That is with shadows turned down to good and multisampling turned down to 2x or 4x. Other than those two exceptions, everything is on Ultra. If you do turn it all on maximum settings though, you get roughly 23 fps. Playable, but not as fluid as I want, and to be honest, those to setting make the least amount of change to the game. Also, Dalaran is still a fps drop location, but that is to be expected and normal.I got a laptop cooler to go along with this and it works great.Overall this laptop is amazing and I give it a 4/5 only due to the fact that it does get a little hot at times.
