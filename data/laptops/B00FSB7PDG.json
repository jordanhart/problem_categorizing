{"Reviews": [{"Title": "MISLEADING REVIEWS", "Author": "Jeremy C", "ReviewID": "R3K4H8N49NFA2R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DISCLAIMER This review was published when the laptop was priced at 299.MISLEADING REVIEWSI review items (over 160 to date). It's disturbing to see two \"reviews\" that have nothing to do with the product. This deal popped up from dealnews.com and I was very close to closing the window based on the \"horrible\" rating. That is clearly unfair. Someone justifying the product gave it a mediocre review and the other person gave the product two stars and didn't even receive or test the product.MY REVIEW IS TO BALANCE THAT OUT AS BEST AS POSSIBLE.If you are looking for a cheap laptop this one certainly meets the spec.Pros:Dealnews.com ranks this as the best priced Pentium laptop of the year (as of 12/2/2013).Asus is a solid and reliable brand. Customer service is stellar (if you do read the original review you can see that Asus directly contacted the reviewer to state that this is a valid product)4.2lbs - On the lighter side of the inexpensive laptop spectrum1366x768 screen resolution is standard. The screen should look as good as any in the $200-$600 price range.HD Camera - Mom will like that for skype. This means I get to actually see my nephew and not the pixelated mess that I've been dealing with :)Intel Pentium 2117U  - Ivy bridge 1.8 GHz is nothing to frown about. It's a generation behind (Haswell being the latest and greatest) but is a solid performer none the less. It is on the lower end of the Ivy bridge spectrum which almost makes me want to put it in the \"expected\" category, however after months of research I still feel that this is a processor that should go in a slightly more expensive computer ($400-$500 range)..aka you're getting more bang for your buck. Keep in mind that this is a Pentium. In my experience that means all the difference. (see note 1 for an explanation of this processor straight from Intel)Expected:Ram - 4GB is standard. I like my laptops running with 8gbHard Drive - 320GB is also standard for this price pointCons:\"HD Cam\" - Yes it's in the pro section but I couldn't find the resolution of the webcam. I'd like to know that going in, however it's not a dealbreakerSummary:I am an avid fan of Asus owning both the new Nexus 7 (yes they make that) as well as a small inexpensive portable that I purchased two years ago. I ran a far less powerful Asus model through the ringer with the demand that I placed on it in both Google earth and Microsoft excel (I am a project manager for an LED company that pins light locations on google earth. Thousands of GPS coordinates put quite a demand on the CPU). I couldn't be prouder of how it stood up. It slips right in my briefcase alongside my new Yoga Pro 2 (YP2 = 1,200 my old Asus $250). I still use it for the dirty work (we also install in manufacturing plants).I wanted to just balance out the star rating best that I could but decided to share some of my experience with Asus as a brand as well as the spec breakdown of the laptop. With a premium (Pentium) 1.8ghz processor and standard Ram this computer should run great for daily use. Don't expect it to be your workhorse but something to use for web surfing and some light work. The reason I found myself here was because I am looking to help my mom purchase a laptop. After writing this and researching I feel like I might be purchasing one soon. Updates to follow if I do!Do some spec research before choosing, but please pay no mind to the two original reviews that are posted here.** Note 1 - Intel Pentium 2117U processor defined (notebookcheck.com)-The Intel Pentium 2117U is an Ultra Low Voltage (ULV) dual core processor for entry-level laptops. It is based on the Ivy Bridge architecture but many of the features like Turbo Boost, Virtualization VT-d, HyperThreading, AES or Trusted Execution are deactivated. The Pentium 2117U integrates a graphics card called Intel HD Graphics that is based on the HD Graphics 2500.The performance of the Pentium 2117U is slightly above a similar clocked Sandy Bridge Pentium CPU. Therefore, the performance is just slightly below the 2.0 GHz Pentium B940.Find my review unhelpful? Please let me know why in the comments field. This is my first unowned product review based solely out of need. I do have plenty of experience in computers and would be happy to answer any questions that you have. I pride myself in writing helpful customer reviews for the Amazon Community.Thank you!", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for everyday tasks", "Author": "rochu168", "ReviewID": "R3RZ4UK19YAIV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not a fancy laptop by any means.  But it works very well for everyday tasks such as surfing the web, checking e-mail, organizing photos and YouTube.  This is a Windows 8 laptop without a touch screen.  It does not matter to me since it is connected to a 22\" led monitor and used as a desktop.  I installed Classic Shell on the laptop and it works like Windows 7.  I have two ASUS Windows 8 laptops (the other one is ASUS VivoBook X202E-DH31T-SL 11.6-Inch Touchscreen) and log on with my live.com account.  Windows 8 syncs the user settings between the two laptops.The laptop has only two USB ports.  I purchased AmazonBasics USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra Mini Hub so I can connect the mouse, keyboard and other USB accessories.  The product description did not mention it; the laptop has an HDMI and a VGA port.  The newer laptops generally only have the HDMI port.  My older Viewsonic led monitor does not have an HDMI port so the VGA port is good to have.  It comes with an optical drive.  I know, I know, we are not supposed to use DVD's anymore.  But I happen to have old DVD's around and having a built-in optical drive is a plus.  When shopping for a value laptop, make sure to look for at least 4 GB of memory; anything less is not sufficient for today's computing needs.I purchased this laptop on Black Friday Deals Week for a great price.  The five star rating is taking into consideration of performance, value and customer service.  I generally do not need tech support unless the product is defective.  But I notice ASUS replies to the negative ratings.  It shows to me that they care about customer experience.  In summary, this is not a cutting edge laptop with the latest bells and whistles.  But it is a well priced laptop great for everyday tasks.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent Laptop for Surfing and Minor Tasks", "Author": "Stacy Corbett", "ReviewID": "R32HHJ73P8EXPE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was looking for an in expensive PC laptop to replace a 5 year old Dell laptop that was on its last leg.  I primarily use a MacBook Pro for work, but I keep a PC around for my devices and apps that don't play well on a Mac.  I wasn't looking to spend a lot since the PC laptop would have limited use, but I also wanted something that had decent performance and felt like a solid machine.  I've had a lot of luck with ASUS products in the past, and based on the reviews here (and the great price), I purchased this machine.Physically the laptop feels a little cheap b/c it has a plastic body (and the plastic feels like...plastic). It doesn't have a \"solid\" feel. But this makes it pretty light and easy to carry around.  The keys on the keyboard are smaller than I've seen on other PC laptops from Lenovo or Dell.  It takes some getting used to and I make some keystroke mistakes b/c keys aren't quite in the spot my fingers expect them to be.  It's not a exactly a quiet keyboard, but I feel the sound comes from the plastic body.My biggest complaint about the machine is with the touchpad.  In the machine I received, the touchpad component actually moves a bit in the case. You can move it a little from side to side. It's a little annoying, but so far in contacting ASUS customer support, they don't have a solution for me.  It's also slow to respond to gestures.  When I try to scroll on a webpage, I feel like it takes about 5 seconds for the machine to realize \"oh you want to scroll here\" and then it works.  Even now writing this review, when trying to move my cursor around this text area, I'm moving my finger on the touchpad, but the cursor doesn't move for about 5 seconds and then it catches up.  ASUS has suggested downloading a bunch of drivers to try and help with this.  Hopefully it will.With 4MB of RAM it's not a screaming fast machine, but it's perfectly fine for surfing and basic tasks.  It boots really fast and in doing general web stuff, I haven't noticed any kind of performance issues.It comes with Windows 8, but you'll want to download Windows 8.1 from the store.  It takes a LONG time to download and install.  And you'll need to make sure the machine doesn't go to sleep while this is all happening.If this was going to be my primary machine and be used daily, I might return it b/c of the touchpad issues I have.  But since it's not,  I'll keep it b/c of the price. Other machines with similar specs are going for $100 more at least.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Happy with my Asus Laptop Purchase", "Author": "shawn", "ReviewID": "R2T4FYVFDH5BQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked up this laptop on Black Friday Deals Week. After using it for about a week, I am very happy with my purchase. For some of the people doubting stuff about it, it does have a HDMI port and a optical disc drive. The screen is vibrant and clear, the speakers sound great, the touchpad/mouse is sensitive and responsive, and the keys have a nice feel to them. I am glad I picked this laptop up on the Black Fridays Deals Week.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly what it should be for the price.", "Author": "K. Miran", "ReviewID": "R1A5O2A5CA6WF6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for my father-in-law so that he could do the required work for his Master's classes on the go. For internet-based tasks such as checking email, browsing, and working on his online courses it does quite well. The build quality, however, leaves something to be desired.Design and Build Quality - If you're familiar with the structure and layout of a Macbook Pro, the body of the computer looks very similar (even the charger looks like an Apple brick) - the difference is that the entire thing is made out of plastic. As a result, both the keyboard and touchpad feel less substantial than I would like (the touchpad even jiggles a bit when you click it), and the whole thing just generally feels a little fragile. Still, this is exactly what I would expect from a sub-$300 laptop such as this, so it's not a surprise - I just don't expect this laptop to last for years. The upshot of all this, is that the laptop itself is extremely light and easy to carry around. The keyboard itself is also satisfyingly clicky (if a bit loud), and the touchpad works well enough. All that said, If you're looking for a machine that instills confidence when you use it, you might want to look elsewhere.Performance: Time will tell in this area, but so far, so good. It does come with some pre-loaded software that you'll want to uninstall and replace, but I've definitely seen worse. Processor's a bit on the slow side, but, again, that's not unexpected. 4GB of RAM will be more than adequate to do anything you need to. It does come with Windows 8 (not 8.1) pre-installed, so you'll need to update it when it arrives.Lastly, for the negative reviews that say this model number doesn't exist, I had my doubts as well, but I'm typing from one right now, so that's obviously not a problem.Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase. For the computer's expected uses, it should do just fine - just don't expect it to last that long.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Asus...just the worst, I mean horrible!", "Author": "Gift Card Recipient \"Glenn Penner\"", "ReviewID": "R1QB23WCUQE7LZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Just the worst! I bought this laptop for my wife for Christmas. She's a PC person and I'm a Mac guy. She just wanted a simple machine to access the internet, check e-mail, and basic word processing. After about three weeks, half of the screen completely went blank. After several restarts, and dealing with Asus tech support it was determined that we needed to send the laptop back to Asus. After about 10 days, Asus sent the laptop back to us with a letter stating the device (about a month old) was not under warranty because of preexisting damage. The letter further stated that an attached page would show pictures of the damage. We'll guess what?! There was no attached page with pictures, likely because there was no external or previous damage. Oh and get this,,,there was chocolate (not from us) on the top of the laptop. Seriously!? Your chubby, candy bar munching, technician got his Baby Ruth remnants on my laptop and now you are telling me the (very new) laptop is not under warranty.

It won't play games or nothing but if you need to surf some internet or write a term paper this baby is the ticket.That was until I plugged my wife's Note 3 into the USB-3 port and it shut down.  Then it wouldn't start.  So I did what you normally do in this situation.  I pulled the battery in order to reset the laptop.So where is the battery you might ask?  Under the keyboard.  That's right under the flipping keyboard.  So 2 ribbon cables and a heart attack later I was able to get to the battery, remove it, and the thing came back to life.  Well, came back to life after an hour of trying to reconnect ribbon cables.  Ribbon cables.  Why did it have to be ribbon cables?While we are on the subject of ribbon cables let me ask you this ASUS... why?  Why do you need a ribbon cable for a power button?  It's a button.  Tell your engineering department I said KISS.  Your engineer's will know what I mean.  On second thought they probably won't.  I know that you're capable of building a seven stage nuclear powered rocked that will get you to work.  You're smart.  I'm proud of you.  Now stop.  Just stop.Why make a case that doesn't allow for the removal of the battery?  I could see taking these steps if it somehow cut down costs or weight.  I don't see how it can.  A case with a hole in it would cost just about the same as a case without a hole.  Holes are free and they weigh less.  Win and win.My other ASUS laptop has a fully removable battery and only costs $100 more.  The hard drive and RAM are easily removed too.  It is more than worth $100 to get a better laptop that is well constructed.I'm disappointed ASUS.  You can do better than this.

One thing is that it doesn't have a consumer changeable battery... good and bad.. if you need a new battery you need to get someone to replace it... but it makes the unit very slim, lite, easy to use; then on the other hand if the battery lasts 3 years, you will probably get another laptop by then. If you don't use the touch pad for a minute or so it sometimes seems to not respond right away, and you need to keep touching or tapping the touch pad to finally get it respond to your touch, then it is OK. Quite annoying actually. There is no way to adjust the touch pad sensitivity also. Had quite an issue with the \"Gesture Pad Functions\" software for about two weeks.. talked to Asus techs.. they keep having me reinstall the drivers.. after about six times or so the Gesture functions are now working only if I let the unit boot up completely before using the laptop. If I use the laptop as soon as the desktop appears there is a 50/50 chance the Gesture pad functions won't come up and will need to restart PC to get them to start. Over all my biggest complaint with this laptop is the issues concerning the touch pad. They are at sometimes annoying and frustrating, and then the touch pad operates like it should for quite a long time. This leads to the fact there is no HDD function light or indicator to know when the laptop has completed booting up or if there is HDD activity going on that may indicate why something is taking time to happen. I solved this by installing a small program I found for free on line called \"HDD Activity Light\" A small flashing icon by the system clock now shows the HDD activity.Now.. other than these annoying little issues; the laptop for the uses that I got it for works out rather well. Once the Gesture Pad Functions are working the laptop performs quite nicely. It has an older CPU, 4 GB ram, 500Gb HDD. Given these shortcomings, given the lite uses I need this laptop for, surfing internet, paying bills, streaming movies from Netflix, editing photos, it is pretty snappy and responsive. The battery last between 3-4 hours with average use.. not great.. but not too bad also.Would I recommend this laptop? Good question... I'm conflicted.. it has issues that I'm OK with, and I'm getting used to them. For me it is not a deal breaker, I wouldn't return the laptop because of these issues. Would someone else want to cope with these niggling issues I don't know. When the unit runs good, it runs really good.

After the upgrade you get a bit more options.Booting to the desktop doesn't take very long, I was planning on throwing in a cheap 120 GB SSD for even faster performance but the bottom is not accessible. I would take it apart but that would void warranty and I would have no idea how to install the OS back onto the SSD.
