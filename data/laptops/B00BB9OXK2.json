{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Acer C7 Chromebook Lightning Review (4 GB of RAM)", "Author": "hostbot", "ReviewID": "R18NHB3IBVA6T8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What is it?This is the latest update to Acer's line of Google Chromebooks, running Google's own Chrome OS- a super light, super fast, and very focused operating environment that brings web apps and the best browser available to the forefront to be the ONLY application available on the system. Despite this \"limitation,\" the device allows users to do the same things (pretty much) that you can do on a full-fledged desktop. Web, email, word processing, spreadsheets, music management, photo management, social networking, news, movies, tv shows... it's all here, and it works well.Who is it for?This isn't for everybody. Let me repeat myself. THIS ISN'T FOR EVERYBODY. In fact, if anything, this is only for those who can handle the reality that you will ONLY be able to use the device with web apps. This isn't the same as a Mac or a PC. It's very different. But if you're pretty much or completely living your computing life in the cloud (like most of us), then this is your solution. And by the way, this also makes an amazing secondary computer if lugging around heavy laptops or relying on a stationary desktop computer isn't your thing.What is your favorite thing about it?I love how fast it is. It blows every browsing experience I've had OUT OF THE WATER. The way the hardware compliments the web-focused software makes it the complete browsing experience I didn't know I wanted.What blows about it?I really am irked by the keyboard. It feels cramped a lot of the time, and although it will take time to get used to, this CAN be a deal-breaker for some. I'm willing to deal with it if that means I can use a snappy machine. I wish Acer would have taken a cue from Samsung, who actually put a full-sized keyboard in their Series 3 Chromebook. Sigh.Wrap-up.Over all, this thing is fast, easy to use, and pretty much headache free. I love how it really shows the Chrome OS we were needing the whole time. And for a mere $219 on Amazon (this does NOT include the 6-cell battery, although it is easily upgrade-able), it almost makes too much sense to pick one of these bad boys up.Grade: 8/10Pick this up, but be very weary of the keyboard and battery. If you need a long-lasting laptop with a beastly keyboard, the Samsung Chromebook is totally for you. If you need something zippy and cheap, the Acer C7 is definitely your guy.Republished from my blog: [...]", "Date": "July 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Acer Chromebook", "Author": "Rizzle \"Riz\"", "ReviewID": "R1VOBVKK1E3Z9L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first chromebook, so I am still getting used to it. But it is lighting fast (compared to the dell I had before). Probably the most memory I use is watching Netflix, but I don't have a problem streaming. It starts up in seconds and the battery seems to last for days on standby, which is nice. Its super light and easy to carry around at work.  You can pull it out like a phone and google for quick answers or bring up documents without the hassle of waiting for startup or a tiny screen. I haven't had any connectivity issues with it.The thing I am disappointed with is the slides, docs and spreadsheets programs.. they are not as compatible with office as I thought they would be, but they will open and edit office docs. However, even with simple documents the formatting is changed dramatically. Its still usable, just requires more effort to re-edit. Being able to store everything on the google drive and open from any computer is awesome.The only thing that's not good is the bottom doesn't come screwed on and there are actually \"warranty void\" stickers over the screw holes, so the back does fall off every now and them, which I feel is asking for trouble.For the price, the value is great.

I wouldn't have gotten one for myself.  There are limits to what you can do with a chromebook.  Of course it isn't a full OS laptop so its limits are within expectations, yet some are very bothersome.  I'm just going to list the Pros and Cons for my Acer Chromebook.Pros:  Fast start up, decent battery life, integrated google doc, drive and app support.  Decent entry level specs for the price. Low price.  Light and mobile unit. Has offline mode (in the case of no internet), 4 usb portsCons:  offline mode isn't the best, limited productivity apps and behind software titans Microsoft Office and Apple's Keynote, very little storage.The biggest con for me is the printing.  I need to print all the time.  Google cloud print is difficult to use, and doesn't support commercial office printers, which is what we have.  So either you have to buy a special google cloudprint ready printer, or use their Print share..which is finicky, has a very simplistic driver and often messes up my print margins.Since I got it for free, I'll use it, because it is definitely lighter than my macbook pro.  However I wish chrome would/could somehow add driver support, because the printing is a dealbreaker for my personal use.I wouldn't recommend this as a primary computer alternative to anyone, it's more like a tablet streamlined for production, with an included keyboard and usb ports.

Tupelo Schneck", "ReviewID": "R237LR8XPI2023", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update, December 2013: at this point, almost all users should get the Acer C720 Chromebook instead of any of the C710 models.I love Chromebook and I love the Acer C7; see my big review at Acer C710-2833 Chromebook or Acer C7 C710-2847 Chromebook.However, *this* Acer C7 version is not the Chromebook for most users.  Most users should get the Acer C710-2833 Chromebook for $199 instead.  There are two changes in this Acer C710-2487: (1) 2GB extra memory for a total of 4GB; and (2) a 320GB spinning hard drive instead of a 16GB SSD.  Don't let the sizes fool you, the spinning hard drive is a significant downgrade in performance, and a larger hard drive offers little benefit on Chromebook for most users.  The extra memory is good, but probably not worth the extra money; and one of the big benefits of the Acer C7 is that it is easy to upgrade yourself.(If you're really keen on the big slow noisy hard drive, you might see if the Acer C7 C710-2847---note the ever so slightly different product number---can be found cheaper.  It has only 2GB memory instead of 4GB.)Note that this is not the Acer C7 with the longer-life battery!  You need the $250 Acer C710-2826, or the $280 Acer C710-2055 or Acer C710-2815, or the $300 Acer C710-2605 for that.", "Date": "March 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Lightweight Computer", "Author": "CLPhoto", "ReviewID": "R3OD8804TKFQ0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I decided to get a Chromebook mostly because I was fascinated by the idea. I decided on the Acer because it was inexpensive and does what I want it to. I'm going to be using it mostly for college. I use iWork (beta) in the cloud for my documents, spreadsheets, and presentations (which having VGA and HDMI is great). I found a lot of web apps for other needs like a calculator, games, some to-do lists, etc. I ended up changing out the hard drive to a 64GB SSD and upgrading the RAM to 6GB total (there are two slots). Even in factory state, it worked swimmingly for what I wanted. I mostly upgraded components because I'm also using Linux on it. Overall, the Chromebook would be a computer I would recommend for someone who knows little about computers because it is very easy to use, there aren't any viruses, spyware, etc, and it does VERY well for what a lot of people use computers for...Facebook and e-mail. For a typical consumer, it takes some adjustment to get used to a more web-based environment, but is perfectly doable. For an advanced user, there is a lot of fun in switching to Linux and having a inexpensive lightweight machine without the \"Windows tax.\" Don't expect a crazy powerful computer, because that isn't the point of a Chromebook. It's meant to be a web-based machine.If I could ask Acer to improve upon anything, it would be battery life. 4 hours isn't bad, but it would be better if it was longer. For instance my 11\" MacBook Air gets 9 hour battery life. 7 hours or so is much more common with 11\" computers on the market at the moment. BUT, so far that is my only complaint.

It is lightweight, handy and the google drive saving the documents is amazing. While it's good for accessing the internet, typing up papers and playing a game/watching a film, it does not have the same capabilities of my 17.3 Dell laptop, so I consider it a companion to the Dell. This little fella is not for heavy computer use or for serious gamers, so anyone looking to buy one should keep that in mind. The weight is wonderful and it fits in my backpack without any extra bulk, which is exactly what I was looking for.I still have to tweak/personalize it and also prefect my typing on such a small keyboard, but all in all, this little laptop performs as expected.Update 8/22/2013: screen suddenly went black after being asleep with it's lid down for a few hours today and would not turn back on. I googled the solution and they suggested a hard restart, battery pull, unplug from AC and 30 second press of the power key. Well since the battery seems impossible to remove, I unplugged the machine and did the 30 second press and it booted up. Apparently this is an ongoing issue with chromebooks and they haven't figured out if it's from a power surge or if it's just gremlins in the machine. I am going to try to shut the thing down completely between uses rather than just close it's lid and see how it does from now on.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty cool", "Author": "beth", "ReviewID": "R2BKA2SNE2WCK4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this as a second laptop in my house.  i keep this one downstairs.

She had trouble getting the jpeg viewer to enlarge a document, but it was easy enough to download an extension.  Much of her schooling is online at the moment and the Chromebook is perfect.  It's small enough to easily fit into a backpack, but not so small she has to squint at the screen or feel cramped by the keyboard.The ChromeOS meets most of her needs and runs quickly with almost any decent Internet connection.  However, she doesn't want to be tied to online applications or Google docs alone so I managed to throw on a copy of Ubuntu under Crouton.  This way she's not dealing with a dual boot environment.  A few key clicks allows her to switch back and forth easily.  LibreOffice does a little better job of formatting documents for MS Word as well as PowerPoint presentations.The only complaint I have is the battery life.  Four hours is a little on the short side for a laptop these days.

I got this for my wife to use at a church conference that is going paperless for all the materials at this conference.  They decided three big binders of paper was just too much.The amazing thing to me is just how close this is to a full on computer but it isn't quite there  but will more than meet my needs for checking email and surfing the web. I got it connected to my DSL router in no time at all.  The weight at 3lbs is nothing to cart along while traveling.I now appreciate just how bad Windows machines really are with all the bloatware and lockups and other quirky things we have all tolerated over the years.  I hope you too will find and appreciate the simplicity of this little wonder of computing power.I suspect those who are not happy with chromebooks failed to do their homework. It is not a full on computer but somewhere between a computer and a tablet. Due diligence will tell you the shortcomings and after reading about all the shorcomings I dove in and am very pleased with the capability of this little marvel.
