I broke my other Dell Inspiron beyond repair. This one had the 10-key on the right side and was lighter so I had high hopes.When I went to work on a grant proposal, the space bar worked intermittently (meaning I had to tap it repeatedly to get it to move on to the next word). This was completely unacceptable so I sent it back.Although it was lighter than the previous Dell, it was manufactured more cheaply. Beware the seller that is only showing you the box and what is inside.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "I'm on it right now.", "Author": "Sierra Roberson", "ReviewID": "R1M4PZXSIBS2YG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm on it right now typing this review. When I took it out of the box it was just a simple laptop and power chord of course with some quick start directions. Very simple. I like that it's windows 7 home premium which is very easy to use and reliable to me. The laptop is very light, it's fast and I haven't had any problems yet. The only thing I found fishy was that when I pressed the power button a black screen with white letters showed up and said something along the lines of \"Scanning/Fixing/Searching for files\" It was the same screen my old laptop made often just before it died completely. Idk what that was all about but it better not do it again next time I start it or I'll have to return it.", "Date": "May 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just like the box says, New Dell with Windows 7", "Author": "Paul Buckner", "ReviewID": "R285EBM27JBHZS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's nice to still be able to get Windows 7 for customers who want it and this laptop arrived in perfect shape, ready for years of use by one of my customers.
