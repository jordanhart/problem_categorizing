So I canceled it before it charged to my card, and went with the $700-800 coverage. Just thought I'd give a heads up to everyone. I bought this laptop for my daughter, I will be having her write a review on it once it gets here and she has a chance to try it out for awhile. I rated this 5 stars for the warranty, because they were extremely helpful and got it transferred over to my daughters name in less than 10 minutes, and it took less than half an hour for it to receive to my email and everything verified.", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my ASUS!", "Author": "Caroleen", "ReviewID": "R1OWX8AKKKH07S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A Mac user for 5 years, I had to buy a Windows machine for work.

A better fit and finish overall than most laptops. ASUS is based in Taiwan. Lenovo is based in Beijing, China (and crazy NC).- MINUSES: Windows 8 in this model is terrible. Just 2 days after starting the laptop up, Win 8 crashed and continues to do so at least twice a day. Search *Windows 8 crash* and there's a lot of posts on forums as well as other sites. Microsoft's forum on their site has complaints exactly like mine and have been awaiting a Microsoft person to address this problem for a good long while. NOTE: The Amazon rep said he's seeing a number of pcs and laptops with Windows 8 customer complaints and returns.My advice is to stick with Windows 7 or Vista. Windows 8 seems to be unstable whether it's turned on fresh from being off, after sleep, or hibernation. Nothing seems to help unless one runs a registry and junk cleaner of which I use 3. So is it a Win 8 bug that causes the system to be more unstable? I think so. I just try to minimize the chance of a crash by constantly cleaning the system. I do know Amazon's live chat with a representative worked and this thing will leave this house.Dear Microsoft: Being fat and happy will get you beat down by an upcoming OS like Chrome.I did purchase an ASUS N55SL-ES71 15.6-Inch Laptop (8Gb RAM)... more money but I can't afford the loss of business.", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS Laptop", "Author": "April A.

We bought it as a second machine because we had been using an almost identical ASUS for a year prior to that. Both machines are great, no problems, exceed expectations, blah, blah, EXCEPT - Unlike the previous machine which had discrete left and right click buttons with the touchpad, the more recent purchase has the left and right buttons merged into the touchpad. After using both, I will never buy a computer that has one of these crappy touchpads again. It is so bad, I usually will try to wait to use the computer until I can hook up my trackball. The touchpad itself even seems to pick up on my fingers moving too close to it sometimes and I will find the cursor jumping around the screen or to a different input field. I find myself hoping the whole thing will die so we can justify going and buying something with a real touchpad with real left/right buttons.My frustration with the touchpad issue makes me want to leave a \"1 star\" rating. The rest of the machine deserves \"5 stars\". I really can't stress enough how frustrating this thing's touchpad is. I even contacted customer service to see if I could get the touchpad swapped out for the other type, but they are physically incompatible so I'm stuck with it.

The extra RAM guarantees switching between applications painless. I was able to run adobe after effects which is a very RAM heavy software for video editors and the computer handled it just fine. However, the computer can handle moderate video editing but not professional. Keep that in mind because it can pertain to other apps such as photoshop and other applications that requires extensive use of your computer's processor and RAM.For you gamers out there this computer can handle moderate games such as League of Legends and Diablo 3. I believe that it can also run games like assassins creed on low settings but it depends on the game. If you are into indie games this computer is perfect for it because they don't require too much in terms of computer specs.Web browsing is smooth like butter if you have a good internet connection and you can seamlessly switch between tabs effortlessly.

Also, when you hit the eject button on the side, when it pops out, it feels like you're going to break it just by touching it. VERY very flimsy, and I was so scared to put a dvd in it that I actually held the bottom of the tray while putting the dvd in.. Also, during the playback of one of the DvD's I was watching, at first the Esc button worked fine and took me out of fullscreen as needed when I wanted to look at or do other things at the same time. But then after awhile, it just stopped working. The Esc key didn't do anything, so I had to use the touchpad to minimize the screen. Le sigh..Seems like my internet connection can't stay on at all, even though it says I have full bars of signal. When I try to go download something, halfway in it says download failed, and so I look at the internet connection, and it appears everything's just frozen. Also cannot do 'multiple' things at once like previous i7 processor models claimed to be able to do. Freezes up and lags if you have more then 2 or 3 things downloading or going at once.Also, like most, the drives are partitioned. Only 279 in C drive, the drive that most everything uses, but 397 in D... don't really understand this so I tried merging the two drives together as stated you could do in the user manel, tried what it said by pressing F9 during bootup and hitting enter, but it keeps bringing me to a totally different screen that doesn't say ANYTHING that's listed on the user manual. I also confirmed with both ASUS and Amazon that this thing had a backlight keyboard. Well, either I have no idea how to activate it, or they both lied, because nothing comes on. Overal, for the price I paid, I am kind of let down, mainly because of the partioned hard drive that ASUS claims cannot be merged together or else I could damage the system because they put them seperate for a reason... and the fact that this machine can't seem to multi task for s*** and keeps dropping internet connection, thus me not being able to download a damn thing without it saying it's failed. Also, when I went to do a system health report, it failed, saying it had timed out.. I tried to do it several times, without luck.. Don't know if I just need to wipe this computer completely or what exactly to do about it. Right now it's also now running loud as hell, like some sort of fan or something just kicked on, and it hasn't shut off. Also, good luck loading the internet when all this lag BS is happening.. I'm now writing this review from my backup notebook because this one wouldn't even load any of the pages it kept timing out!", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "badly configured", "Author": "Nael", "ReviewID": "R238XF5I42HKRG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "257 g are only for data out of 750g.
