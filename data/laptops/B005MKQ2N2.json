{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bait & Switch from 3rd party provider \"Rugged Notebooks\"", "Author": "Geoff", "ReviewID": "R6CZQKP890GDQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sorry to post this, as I know Amazon says \"Don't describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback)\". BUT MY CUSTOMER FEEDBACK WAS DELETED.I ordered this laptop as it is advertised above: Panasonic Toughbook CF-74, 2GB, running Windows 7That's what it says on this page, that's what it said in the e-mail order confirmation, that's what it said in the \"pending Orders\" page here at Amazon.But what Rugged Notebooks sent was: Panasonic Toughbook CF-74, ~ONE~ GB, running Windows ~XP~!Note the difference? Funny thing, when I sent a \"contact the seller\" message, they CALLED me. (how the heck did they get my phone number?!?!) Of course, by doing this there would be no \"paper trail\" of messages that Amazon representatives could look at later.Rugged Notebooks initially admitted they had screwed up, and were going to e-mail me a return label. THEN a senior representative called back and said they had NOT screwed up, and that I should have looked at the \"fine print\" on the second page. They still were willing to have me send it back for a refund, so that's what I did.4 days AFTER UPS reports Rugged Notebooks received my return, I still had no refund, so I opened a dispute with Amazon A-to-Z. A day later I got my money back (which is one reason why I use Amazon).I posted a shortened version of this in the \"Customer Feedback\" for Rugged Notebooks, and lo & behold, it has been removed, along with my 1-star. I have requested an explanation from Amazon as to why they removed it, but in the mean-time I am posting this here.In My Opinion, you should NEVER buy anything from Rugged Notebooks.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Panasonic Toughbook CF-74 Semi-Rugged Notebook PC - Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0GHz, 2GB DDR2, 80GB HDD, Combo, 13.3\" Display, Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit\nIntegrated Graphics CD-ROM Burner/DVD Player Integrated High-Definition Audio 2 USB Ports\nRJ-11 Phone Connector RJ-45 Ethernet Connector Bluetooth 2.0 Intel\u00ae Wireless WiFi Link 5100 802.11a/b/g/draft-n", "Name": "Panasonic Toughbook CF-74 Semi-Rugged Notebook PC - Intel Core 2 Duo 2.0GHz, 2GB DDR2, 80GB HDD, Combo, 13.3\" Display", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51yIK3WbIvL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005MKQ2N2"}}
