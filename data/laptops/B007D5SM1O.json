The only PC game I play is Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 which runs well except for when I use night mode. The battery drains too quickly sometimes. I hate the placement of usb and ethernet ports.

We had to get used to the keyboard keys - if you hit them under a certain angle (if you are further from the laptop than usual, for instance) there is a chance of accidentally bumping one off its clasps.
