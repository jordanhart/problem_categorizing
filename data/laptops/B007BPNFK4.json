The battery life is almost 5 hours  The always on usb port to charge my phone is a nice feature.  Win7 64bit performs beyond expectations with Aero off.  14 is perfect for transportation.Cons;  The speakers are just plain bad. Not a big deal to me though.  The display adapter is only o.k.Would I buy it again....HECK YA!It crushes my netbook on every single level except portability.", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Machine", "Author": "Ravi Daswani \"The Custom Tailor\"", "ReviewID": "R1C53LN74BIQ7B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Over the course of the last 1 month - one by one the following have failed on my brand new fujitsu (bought less than 3 months ago) :Network card (working sporadically only)USB3 ports (both of them)The trackpad (not working any more)The numlock keysThe erratic jumps of the mouse (using external mouse)Who knows what else will fail on this horrendous machine.Never buy a Fujitsu any more - the product is made in china to very low quality levels - combined with horrible customer service (solutions not acceptable) - I have just wasted $1100 on them.Be Warned!!", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Needs better speakers", "Author": "overagain", "ReviewID": "R1RR5VU9OJAXKZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's a fairly generic laptop.

As a rather average college student myself, I thought this laptop would be sufficient for my needs. 4GB RAM is NOT enough - this computer started freezing and crashing in the middle of not-very-taxing applications like running a Facebook game, or even running Microsoft Word. I got the Blue Screen of Death just by going on Tumblr once. I'm a very light gamer, unlike some of my friends whose laptops handle LoL and WoW just fine. However, if I run iTunes, the computer's fan goes crazy and even after I close the application, I have to restart the computer to return it to normal.Pros:--The weight. Many people were jealous of how light my laptop was, especially because my campus is very walking-oriented. Portability was definitely a big plus.--Graphics. The display is very clear and enjoyable for basic purposes.--Initial battery life. The battery life is pretty decent in the beginning, lasting me about two classes before I need to charge it again.Cons:--RAM is way too small for the average college student. Anything remotely taxing on the memory throws this computer for a loop - FB games, Tumblr, iTunes especially, Sims, etc.--The whole computer is rather flimsy, made out of plastic. Pieces of it starting cracking off, and the top is a fingerprint and smudge magnet which I had to clean every week almost so that people didn't think I was some sort of gross person...--Random crashes and bluescreening.--One of the two harddrives was always completely full because of Windows Restore, so I only had 250 gbs to work with.tl;dr:If you want something stronger than a Netbook that has has a decent battery life, then this computer is for you, but there are better priced computers for the same specs.", "Date": "July 11, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Box Contents - Fujitsu FPCR46271, AC Adapter, 6-cell Lithium-Ion Battery; Pre-installed Software - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, Microsoft Office Preloaded (purchase Product Key Card to activate software), 1-Year Limited Warranty\nIntel Core i5-2450M 2.5GHz Processor\n3MB Cache\n4GB DDR3 SDRAM\n500GB 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive", "Name": "Fujitsu LIFEBOOK LH531 14\" Notebook - Intel Core i5 i5-2450M 2.50 GHz (FPCR46271)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51ep9arTvbL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007BPNFK4"}}
