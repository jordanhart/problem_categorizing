Luckily I figured out the problem and kept the computer.  I really love how slender it is, it is fast and responsive and will play computer games I like to play, and with a 1 terabyte hard drive I'm not seeing or worrying about it slowing down do to low memory space.  The 8 gigs of ram helps keep every thing moving fast (a lot faster than my desk top).  Most importantly being able to play my favorite game somewhere other than my desk top made my wife happy.

Great for work, gaming, multitasking.", "Author": "isaxman", "ReviewID": "R2F5V5M1GBV3NV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this computer so far! I'm not a computer expert or anything, but here were my overall impressions:Pros:Hard Drive (1 TB): Plenty of storage space and doesn't take too long to load or boot either! I've heard some people replace theirs with a SSD to speed things up, but I don't feel the need to as this this runs pretty quick and smooth already.Processor (AMD A10 5757) great for gaming. Some people prefer the higher end i7s which is cool, but from what I've seen, this is a great processor especially for the price.Graphics (Radeon HD 8750M) Having 2gb of dedicated graphics memory is awesome. The graphics and frame rates are great for gaming. You can find a bunch of benchmark tests online, and I haven't tested for them myself, but every game I've tried so far has been extremely smooth on high settings. That includes Skyrim, Half Life 2, Mass Effect 2 & 3, The Stanley Parable, and Fallout 3. Granted, some of these are slightly older games, and I haven't seen how games like Battlefield 3 & 4 will perform yet. But so far, this thing has been super solid for gaming.Keyboard: I'm actually a big fan of the keyboard. It feels very accurate and has a number pad as well.Size, Weight, and Appearance: This thing is so thin and light! It's metallic finish also looks really cool.Battery: The battery life seems pretty average. It's hard for me to give a time estimate as it depends on what you're using it for. Netflix and games seem to run out the battery considerably fast which is to be expected. But overall, you can get around 3 hours of battery with heavy use and more with lighter use. Also, there's a power saver option that's easy to turn on.Screen: I actually like the screen. It's pretty crisp, however it isn't full HD.Windows 8: This may be an unpopular opinion, but I really like Windows 8. I've heard that people have issues with it slowing down their computer, but with the processor and GPU on this thing, it doesn't seem to be an problem. It's very sleek and so far, works great especially with a computer as fast as this one.Multitasking: I've had multiple large downloads going at once while watching netflix and running a bunch of other programs on this thing just to see how it would fair. Didn't slow it down even a little. Download speeds were slowed, but not by much. Ex. about 2.5 mb/s on both Steam and Origin at the same time while browsing the web.Cons (not many):Track pad: It kind of sucks because the right and left mouse buttons are a part of the pad itself which makes it hard to click on anything without moving the mouse. It's not really that bad and gets better the more you get used to it, but it's easily remedied with an optical mouse. (highly recommend for gaming)No CD/DVD drive!!!: This might be hard on some people, but I find I rarely end up needing to use a disk drive anyway. I ended up buying a $25 LG super portable USB CD/DVD burner drive that works very well when I need it and so the lack of a built in drive is a non-issue for me.The screen: I'm not sure where to put the screen on this list. Yeah it's not full HD, but for a 720p screen, it looks good, and I find myself not caring too much.Overheating: Both the power supply and the laptop can run a little hot when you're running a lot of things. It's not a huge concern, and also something to be expected I guess, but it's something to keep an eye on....Overall, I highly recommend this laptop.

First, I want to explain why I rated it four stars as opposed to five stars. On its own, the laptop is very capable, but it does get warm and the fans will blow constantly while playing games. Also, the hard drive is a definite bottleneck in the system, which does hurt the system's performance. However, replace the hard drive with a solid state drive (make sure you get a 7mm drive), max the memory to 12 GB and get a cooling pad, this laptop is an easy five star rating.Specs are available in a number of places. I don't have a lot to say on this other than once you get used to the keyboard, it works quite well. The biggest issue is the lack of status lights on the system. No Caps Lock, Num Lock or Scroll Lock indicators, no hdd activity lights. These are remedied with software easily enough. For those asking, this does not have a touchscreen nor a backlit keyboard. No optical drive is included, but a USB DVD drive can be had for less than $40.The Aspire V5-552G-X852 ships with the original Windows 8. Acer does not supply Windows 7 drivers for this laptop, but if you search online you can find instructions for installing Windows 7 that aren't too terribly difficult to follow. Why Windows 7? Well, as much as I like Windows 8.1 (it's not as bad as people say it is), I tend to run a lot of older games which don't necessarily play nice with Windows 7, let alone Windows 8.Okay, so now you may be asking yourself, what games have I tested with the laptop and what are the results? Well, I don't have any testing software, so these notes will be based on my own observations, not on \"serious\" testing. I do have 12 GB memory in the system, a cooling mat and the stock 5400 rpm hdd. Your mileage may vary:Minecraft - I see this question asked and yes, the laptop does run Minecraft pretty well. I don't have all the settings maxed, but the game plays smoothly for the most part. There are some slowdowns when you first start the game as it is loading the world around you.Skyrim - I'm running this with AA set to 8x and Anisotropic at 16x. No major slowdowns that I've seen so far. However, I haven't run into a dragon or major battle yet, so this may change.The Sims 3 - A little disappointed that the system can't run this game well at full detail, but it runs okay at medium-high settings. The hard drive is a serious bottleneck here as loading the game takes long enough, but then saved games can take up to 5 minutes to load as well.Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning - Max settings, no slowdowns that I've seen so far. This includes combat with multiple enemies.Dragon Age games - Dragon Age: Origins plays well at max settings. Dragon Age II plays nearly as well, but there is some stuttering in the animation while walking. Combat doesn't seem to stutter, so I'm thinking the hard drive bottleneck may be coming in to play.BioShock Infinite - Limited testing at both medium and full settings, the game runs fine. No real slowdowns detected.I've tested a number of other games as well, but these are my usual stress testing games. So again, overall the system exceeded my expectations. With a decent sized solid state drive, it could be an even faster system.

Windows 8 works as well as 7, and works well if you are a gamer, unless you try using the mouse pad of course.  But all Windows 8 did is take the start menu, place it in front of the desktop and replace folders with apps.  So now, its like it automatically brings up your start menu, before you can get to your desktop.  In short, Windows 8 functions well but the interface sucks.

It easily has the loudest speakers I have ever heard on a laptop and they sound very rich with little to no distortion turned all the way up.

It has gotten a little warm (top of keyboard area) when I have played Elder Scrolls Online (does mostly high level graphics very stable) for a couple of hours but the fans extract the heat very well. The screen can seem a little flimsy but you shouldn't be poking or pressing on the screen anyways; other than that the build quality is very nice. The only minor complaint I have about this laptop is how loud the fans can be, but they do their job very well and their function well outweighs the noise level, especially since the speakers can easily drown out said noise.

I purchased the Acer Aspire V5-552G-X852 and the Asus X750J laptop and use both in my work. Though the two computers cost about the same, the Asus laptop is by far the better computer. The keyboard feels sturdy and I'm less likely to hit the wrong key or multiple keys, and the feel of the computer is superior. The Acer Aspire, on the other hand, seems to have been slapped together with little thought given to design. The power button is squirreled away on the left edge of the computer, not above the keyboard as one would expect. The only USB-3 port is on the back side of the computer, which seems a retro-1980s kind of thing to do, since using a modern peripheral becomes challenging, especially when the laptop is wired to power and other peripherals. I have to turn off the unit, fold down the screen, and unplug one or more peripherals just so I can access the USB-3 port. Bad design!! The headphone jack failed after only a few uses. I purchased several peripherals, all of which work perfectly on the Acer Aspire, but many of these work poorly or not at all on the Asus X750J. All in all, the computer is functional, but minimally so. I decided on the Acer Aspire based on its highly-touted graphics package, but after running challenging games and other graphics-heavy software on both units, the Asus laptop is always just as good if not better. If I had known this BEFORE purchasing, I would have gone with two Asus units and skipped over the Acer. It was a $600 mistake, and not one I am likely to repeat. The Acer unit is acceptable, but I recommend other computers. I'm finding the Asus laptop everything I hoped it would be. HP computers, also, have always served me well. You may have other reasons for preferring the Acer over other computers. Maybe you see it on sale.
