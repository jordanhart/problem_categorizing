{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A snarling beast of a laptop, with just a few quirks", "Author": "Gregory E. Suarez", "ReviewID": "R21SCIO0K6ONCS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Samsung Series 7 Gamer laptop for over a week now, and I thought I'd share my thoughts on the machine since I haven't found much out there about it.  Overall, it's a very fancy, very powerful piece of hardware.  And the price certainly reflects that.  While you could spend thousands more on even fancier, gobbed-out custom notebooks - or even a completely tricked out Alienware - the S7G was more than adequate for my purposes (and for the price of a top-end Alienware, you really should buy a desktop system, anyway).  I bought the laptop for two primary reasons: 1) To run Guitar Rig 5, which is a very CPU-intensive virtual guitar amp/effects program used for performing and recording, and 2) to play games from the past several years at high levels.  Gaming-wise, I'm primarily a console gamer, but since it's looking less and less like the next Xbox and PlayStation will be backward compatible with current-gen games (probably with the exception of platform-defining first-party titles like Halo and Uncharted), I wanted to start collecting my current favorites on the PC so I don't have to shelve and maintain extra consoles when the next-gen rolls around.  I wanted titles like Batman: Arkham Asylum/City, Skyrim, the Mass Effect trilogy, GTA4, Fallout 3/NV, Dead Island, BioShock, and Metro 2033 to all be available when the mood strikes me.  Not to mention the upcoming final round (for the Xbox 360 and PS3) of highly anticipated current-gen titles: Max Payne 3, Metro: Last Light, Far Cry 3, BioShock: Infinite, GTA5, etc.While the S7G is definitely a brute of a laptop (in a good way), let me get its bad points out of the way first.  The most negative aspect of this laptop is Samsung's proprietary Mode Dial.  Basically you can turn a knob on the front of the laptop, and there are instructions built into the system to enable/disable certain features depending if you want quiet (no fan), battery savings (backlit keyboard off), or all-out gaming performance (everything on and maxed out, battery be damned).  It's pointless, and what's worse, the interface that overlays on your desktop is annoying.  It comes preloaded with desktop themes that will engage a screen saver after 60 seconds no matter what.  The good news is from the desktop you can disable the themes and revert to a traditional Win7 desktop, which also kills the screen saver.  However, there's still a clickable node in the upper-right corner of the desktop that allows you to tweak the Mode Dial settings; this will not go away.  I personally have the dial set to \"game\" mode all the time; the likelihood that I'll used this laptop unplugged for more than a half-hour is close to zero.The second biggest disappointment with the S7G is its plastic case.  While it looks like a TRON wet dream when the lid's open, the laptop's housing is light-weight plastic.  For almost 20 bills, this really needs to have a higher quality metal case.  Perhaps it was an effort on Samsung's part to reduce weight, but it's probably an effort on Samsung's part to reduce its cost.Other negatives: I have the laptop connected to an external monitor via HDMI, and I use an external USB keyboard and USB mouse (running through a USB hub).  The laptop sets under a shelf, on which the monitor sits.  I put the computer into sleep mode overnight and during the day when I'm at work.  The problem is, the factory default settings kill the power to the USB ports when in sleep mode, and I could not get the external keyboard to \"wake\" the computer.  The only way I could wake it is to unplug everything, move the keyboard out of the way, pull it out from under the shelf, open the lid, make sure it wakes, close the lid, slide it back under the shelf, reposition the keyboard, and plug everything back in.  I wasted an hour on-line chatting with Samsung tech support, and never once did the support rep understand the problem, even though I explained it to him about 873 times.  I went to Google and found the solution: you have to get into the BIOS and enable the USB devices to retain power while in sleep mode, which allows them to wake the computer.  Shouldn't tech support know this?  If you need to contact Samsung tech support, do yourself a favor and exhaust all other searches before you call because my on-line tech support chat session with Guptarjeeshaputa in Bombay was akin to slamming my face into a brick wall repeatedly for 60 straight minutes.The final negative is one gamers want to pay attention to: the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 675M is a very, very nice GPU.  However, it is essentially a rebadged GTX 580M from the previous generation.  NVIDIA will soon release the new GTX 680M, which uses a whole new chipset, will be faster, and run cooler.  If I did not need a new laptop immediately, I would have waited for the 680M.  If you are concerned about such things, hold on a little longer until laptops are available with the new GPU.This is not really a complaint, but more of a warning to those who might be unaware: this laptop is huge (\"It sure is, Tiny Elvis!\").  It's big and it's heavy, and it's not something you'll want to just pop out of your bag on the metro or an airplane.  The power brick is also enormous.  When I was unpacking the laptop, I saw the edge of the power supply and thought it was another box of parts.  Not until I pulled it out did I realize it was the power brick!  It's also worth noting that to order a second power supply, expect to spend some serious money.  I ordered a travel/backup supply through Samsung parts (it's not available anywhere else), and it was about $150 for the brick and power cord (note: they are sold separately from each other, so make sure you buy both pieces).  The battery also doesn't last long; expect maybe a couple of hours if you're lucky.  Again, I knew this when I bought it, but if you've never owned a 17\"+ high-power laptop, be aware of this stuff.Okay, on to the positives.  This laptop is very powerful.  It has not choked at anything I have thrown at it (with one exception, see below).  It also has a very eye-pleasing, modern design.  While I normally use it with the lid closed, when I do open the lid it feels like you're at the helm of a spaceship.  It's wickedly fast booting up Windows.  I go from entering my Windows password to a fully ready desktop in about 10 seconds or less.  This is thanks to the 8GB ExpressCache SSD.  For everything going on under the hood, the heat output remains nicely under control, even under the duress of Battlefield 3 and Skyrim.  While the built-in cooling system is nice, I still HIGHLY recommend a laptop cooling pad; they're inexpensive, easy to use, and keep your big investment running at a safe temp.  It also has tons of storage (note that the system has two 750GB HDDs that are NOT in RAID 0, so it has a total of 1.5TB of storage, but not in a single C: drive). Also not listed in any spec sheets is the laptop uses DDR3-1600 RAM, so expect 1600 MHz speeds (verified with CPU-ID).So far I have had a wonderful gaming experience with the S7G.  I use 1920x1080 resolution for all games, and I'm generally able to get high performance numbers even at that high of a resolution.  However, DirectX 11 is just a bit too much for the system to handle with some games at that resolution, and I sometimes back games down to DX10.  Here are some of my performance numbers (collected using reports generated by FRAPS, or the game's internal benchmarking tool):Batman: Arkham Asylum - 54 FPS (Ultra settings, PhysX on HIGH, 4x AA)Batman: Arkham City - 47 FPS (Ultra settings, PhysX on HIGH, DX10, 4x AA)Battlefield 3 - 30 FPS (Ultra settings, 2x AA)Crysis 2 - 30 FPS (High Quality Texture Pack, Ultra settings, DX10)Diablo III - 60+ FPS (Highest settings, 8x AA)Grand Theft Auto IV - 62 FPS (Ultra settings, View Distance = 50, Detail Distance = 50, 8x AA, sometimes dips to < 30 FPS during top speeds in heavy traffic)Max Payne 3 - 30+ FPS (with HDAO and minimum AA)RAGE - 40 FPS (Ultra settings, 16x AA)Serious Sam 3 BFE - 30 FPS (Ultra settings, 4x AA)Skyrim - 54 FPS (Hi Res Texture Pack, Ultra settings, 8x AA, 13 additional user mods running)The only game giving me problems is The Witcher 2.  To get a playable frame rate of over 30 FPS, I have to switch everything to low.  With medium settings I get less than 20 FPS, and it chugs and stutters.  After doing some research, I'm finding a lot of people unable to get this game running well, even on machines exceeding the recommended specs from the publisher.  I am still investigating this, but I believe this is a situation where the game has incredible graphics, but is very poorly optimized.  I can play Battlefield 3, Max Payne 3, and Batman: Arkham City at very high quality and not run into the frame rate problems The Witcher 2 has.In conclusion, if you're looking for a fast gaming laptop right now, the Samsung Series 7 Gamer should be at the top of your shopping list.  I looked at several other brands (Alienware, HP, Sager), and the Samsung, more than any other brand/model, met my needs at a price I was willing to pay.  You can spend thousands more if you can afford it, but you get a lot of bang for your buck with the S7G.  It isn't perfect, but it sure will get the job done.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous Gaming Powerhouse.", "Author": "Saint04", "ReviewID": "R38REKVH205ZFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "BackgroundPurchased this system as a Grad student for both college and play.ScreenThe screen is a beautiful HD 1920 X 1080 Resolution screen. I've never seen anything like this; not even on a television. It is a retina scorching 400 nits with superb contrast and very deep blacks.SoundDolby home theater surround sound. System sounds lifelike and has a built in sub-woofer. I'm very pleased with the sound quality all though I think the JBL sound system on the new regular 17.3\" Samsung series 7 sounds better.KeyboardMost comfortable keyboard I've ever used. The keyboard slopes back to accommodate wrists and sys cooling. The keys are a curved style like Lenovo's laptops. Very ergonomic. White backlighting; \"WASD\" keys light red in \"gamer mode.\"PerformanceOne of the best-performing systems available for the price. Runs cool and quite. One game won't run so far; \"Tribes Ascend.\" I'm very upset about this as it's my favorite game to play right now. It will not run on any of the new gaming laptops with 3rd gen i7. Battery life is not that good (2.5-3.5 hours). No wifi or connectivity issues. Wifi has great range and seems a little above average.*****Coreection*******The game would not run because of the Nvidia driver. I had to delete a file from the Nvidia driver folder. I don't recall what file was deleted. Tribes Ascend now runs on the system after deleting the file. I have not noticed any problems with the system since deleting the file.DesignPlastic Chassis, glossy black-like finish and black-anodized brushed aluminum palm wrest and keyboard area. Overall, a beautiful and sturdy computer. I'd prefer all aluminum, but Apple would probably start another lawsuit lol :-P. At-least Samsung didn't ripoff this design. System looks both fun for gaming and professional in office environments.Value:Great v competition in my own opinion i.e. Dell Alienware and Asus G75. I'm am biased as Samsung is my brand of choice and Apple second to Samsung.ConclOverall, I'm very excited and pleased to be the owner of Samsung's first gaming system. I think they are a company that takes themselves seriously and will continue to excel in their ventures. Thanks Samsung for a high-quality and innovative gaming system.Hope this quick overview helps.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Actually Replaced my 5 Year Old Desktop Gaming Rig", "Author": "USMC Combat Vet \"Retired!\"", "ReviewID": "R1HDFICDHCTX8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read literally hundreds of reviews of everything I could find. Being retired I simply can NOT afford this. But it kept \"calling out\" to me....The wife \"called out\" a few things her own self when I showed it to her as well. But, I simply will cut to the chase and say I love this thing. I have no games that I can't run at their highest settings. To my amazement, it even plays Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings so fast it literally altered game play. I mean, it was so slow on any of my other 4 computers I had abandoned it completely. now, it simply RIPS through all that used to flat kill my other rigs.  I will leave all the already repeated hype to the others...I just want to throw out there that this is rock solid for weeks now. Bummer was the price dropped a LOT within a few minutes of my buying it but I kept it anyway. Not going to make Amazon suffer & send it back then reorder! I guess I never paid top dollar before yet came away still so happy. Only weird glitch I have had is once I had turned Bluetooth on and my games ALL turned to crap. I mean this computer flat fell on it's face! More embarrassing was it took me 2 days to figure out the problem and what I had done to screw things up. Most of the reason it took me so long is I had been playing nonstop for 18-20 hours both days! I was mortified once I realized my stupid mistake.  Other weird thing is that every single time I open the lid I KEEP getting a damned warning that my auto update feature for Windows needs to be turned on. What pisses me off is I have changed to do auto update over 200+ times already and it simply won't hold that setting! I finally turned off the notification setting altogether so I don't completely lose my old mind. Go to change the speaker volume after a few hours of game play & risk burning your finger, it DOES get that hot. But...it has been rock solid unless I do something stupid to sabotage things so not going to ding it for that. I am giving this a rare 5 stars after honestly torturing it for a month now. I will downgrade it on the spot if it bites me in any way or as I find weaknesses that simply have not shown themselves to me yet. I SO wanted the Asus to save money but all the complaints in reviews scared me off. Glad they did too after a month with this beauty. Like so many, the black is uninspiring, wish it was the candy red like at the CES show. But if after all I have done to this, WITH this the past month, if I still love it this much, at this price and with me on my meager Social Security check to live on...well, it must have EARNED that 5 stars.Sept 25 2012 UPDATE:  I know being retired is gonna wear me out.....Now I have a battery issue. I always have it plugged in yet after 10 hours of gaming my battery is dead (well, down to 12% remaining). I am forced to close the lid and it then takes a couple hours to slowly recharge so I can resume gaming. Not sure if I am the only one having this problem? Of course I should take a break by then anyway I suppose?October 25 2012 Update:  Samsung Support (for ME) has been a pleasant surprise. A woman who spoke perfect English and in America now less (!!!!) advised me to do a battery recondition. I did this while explaining to her she was full of crap....well surprise, it solved my problem. I now have had 3 weeks of gaming 12-18 hours a day with my newer XCOM: Enemy Unknown as well as Medal of Honor: Warfighter both as max settings with ZERO issues. Due to this and some new negative reviews that look like scam reviews by LOONS or trolls I am raising this to a well deserved 5 stars. On it's own, this deserves it. I waited to go 5 stars until it had been time tested, not to just rush in when all excited etc. And 1 warning. If you ever have to use the supplied restoration disk that Samsung provides to restore? Well as another reviewer correctly explained, you LOSE EVERYTHING you need to make this computer work! I recommend you go to Samsung NOW and do the following. Go to their support area and download each & every available download so when & if you need to restore, you will have all these drivers ready to go. If not, no track-pad, no sound, no nothing....REALLY pissed me off. It was a nightmare experience but a lesson well learned. Trust me, you NEED to do this now, before you get stuck. Now that everything has \"burned in\", has a couple thousand (yes thousand) hours on it, all is rock solid. Gaming has become my life sadly, but I am all smiles so why worry? 5 solid stars all around. For the record I am not any kind of Samsung \"fanboy\" or even Samsung \"fan codger\"! I have adjusted my rating on this 3 times now and maintain my reviews to honestly reflect all that I spend my money on. I am loyal to NO brand. I just call em like I see em.10 Month Update on June 19 2013:  This computer has fully EARNED it's solid 5 stars. I can't kill it. NO game I have bought even creates any challenge for it. Other than my wife, this has been love at first sight, and a love affair than has never waned......", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Blown Away", "Author": "Palful", "ReviewID": "RC7TO37RLFRJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for about a week now and I absolutely love it. I have a busy lifestyle with kids so the only time I can carve out for gaming is late at night. I used to head down to the basement while my lovely wife would be in bed and play on my desktop. I got tired of feeling neglectful of my wife and getting eaten by spiders in my unfinished basement so I figured it was time to get a laptop for the bedroom.I purchased this tray to use in the bed: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GU7GAK/ref=oh_details_o02_s00_i00 and the laptop sits atop it perfectly.After my wife drifts off to sleep I pull out this bad boy and am treated to spectacular gaming experience in ultimate comfort.Pros:- Best screen on a laptop I have ever seen, it can even do 120Hz if you want. The brightness is nearly blinding (in a good way) and the black levels are excellent.- Keyboard is pleasant to play on and the backlighting really helps when playing in the dark. The best part of this keyboard is that it doesn't feel cheap and it has extensive \"anti-ghosting\" for gaming. It really helps when playing games that require a lot of button pressing.- Very quiet. This was a huge concern for me due to the fact I am lying next to someone while playing computer games in a bed. My wife says she has no problem sleeping with the small amount of noise it does make.- Very cool, I've had laptops that feel like they could boil a pot of water, this laptop runs at a very reasonable temperature considering the internals.- I can run all of my games on ultra (so far). I've only played Diablo 3, TF2 and SC2 so far but it looks a heck of a lot better than my desktop sporting an older 9800 GTX.Cons:- It's HEAVY. Not really surprising considering what's in this thing but it's noteworthy. I will never travel with it so it's not a huge problem for me.- Doesn't support RAID, it comes with 2 - 750GB drives but no hardware raid which is kind of silly. Not the end of the world but it would have been nice.- The video card is not an AMD 7970M. The 675M is still a great card even if it's just a re-labeled 580m but it's not cutting edge anymore. I was aware of this fact when I bought it but it didn't stop me from forking over my cash based on how great this laptop is otherwise.I would highly recommend this laptop to anyone who wants a great desktop replacement gaming laptop. It does not feel cheap; it's gorgeous and has all of the features you need for gaming. A job well done by Samsung.", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not worth the specs, won't last long enough", "Author": "Dragonwolf", "ReviewID": "R2EYRQSAISNQ6A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Final Update 6: I have dropped the rating to a 1 star, while the specs may be nice, you can get better spec'ed laptops for about the same price. They will probably last you a lot longer. I've had 2 warranty repairs in the first year of ownership and now the reliability has taken another hit, where the graphics card likes to crash on occasion, even after installing different drivers and such. I finally attempted a Windows 7 re-install and things seem to be running ok, though with 1 crash since the redo it makes me question it,but I haven't really used it too much as I NEED reliability. So I ended up getting a new Laptop. Better spec'ed and better built by far. Plus it was a little cheaper. Samsung also seems to have abandoned the Gamer series as there has been no Haswell refresh of the Gamer Series, where Asus, Alienware, even Toshiba has done refreshes and everything. When I bought this laptop, I expected it to last me at least 2 years, if not longer as the specs where higher than I needed at the time. (I expect this out of all laptops I buy. Since I tend to buy while thinking ahead.) Instead, it's been about a year and 3 months. It's now out of warranty, and I will not spend ANYMORE money on this laptop. It's just not worth it since the reliability is the most important thing to me and it's the one thing in question.With all these updates I CANNOT recommend this laptop with the reliability issues I have had. To be fair I probably got a lemon, but also with everything else newer that has come out I can't recommend it. With this being said I will not be doing any more updates until it actually dies. (Even then it may be awhile before I update it as it's not at the top of my todo list.) I am still a student, and almost done with classes, but still use the computer for so much more. I can't have reliability issues. I have owned Asus before this and while I've had small issues here and there. They were ALWAYS fixable, but when primary parts fail like in this one. (Cpu first time, gpu second time and now maybe a third time and it's no longer under warranty.)Will this marks the end of this part, read on for the whole shebang, but this is the most up to date one.Update 5: I received my laptop back on June 14th (2013) after about 2 weeks of waiting. (This includes shipping it to them, which cost me another $50) It is running like new again. I added a star since the repair went pretty quick and seems good. I may add 1 more star if this lasts longer than that last repair (which was in November, so it was like 7 months.) I won't be giving 5 stars no matter what as this issue has soured my thoughts on Samsung now. (And I think I may be generous with the 4 stars, but I am also keeping in mind I may have gotten duds.) Again, 2 repairs in less than a year? It makes me question the lifespan of the laptop. Performance wise it's great, but it may go bad again, only time will tell and if it happens I will be completely re-writing my review from scratch. I really, really want to love this laptop, but it's becoming harder to do so.Update 4: This is a minor update to Update 3 (Below): They have pushed my Estimated repair date twice now. Originally it was going to be done on June 4th, then it got pushed to June 10th. Now it's been pushed to June 11th. (They are probably waiting on a replacement part.) But this is just not good. I have docked another star due to the issues. It is making it harder and harder to suggest buying this laptop. I really WANT to love it, and for the specs you can't go wrong. But the issues I am having is just a big issue when it comes to making me wonder about longevity. I bought this laptop to last me for a long time, and now as stated later, I have had to send it in 2x in less than a year for repairs. Almost $100 more for shipping it. The brand Samsung, has always been the name of a great, wonderful and quality product to me. Now I am really starting to wonder if they have left me like other brands have. I am just glad I picked up an Asus G46 for under $700 at Best Buy so that I could still do my schoolwork and play games. I anxiously await getting my Samsung back, if only to have the horsepower again, and will just hope that all the delays allow them to really make sure that it is in full working order. If that happens and I don't need to send it in again, ever, I will restore this to a 5-star despite the issues, I'll know that Samsung still takes care of their customers. (I'm really hoping things will be great so I can do so. :)UPDATE 3: I had to send my laptop in again for repair! This is starting to get ridiculous! I paid almost $2000 for a laptop that was suppose to last me a long time. (I bought it for gaming and so that even if the games started getting a little more advanced I figured that for the power it would last me awhile. But now after having ownership for about 10 months and needing to send it in twice now it's just mounting up to be even more expensive! It cost almost $50 to ship it both so add another almost $100 to the price I paid! I am now docking 2 stars from the perfect 5 stars I gave it. I understand things can go wrong, but twice in 1 year, scratch that less than a year? I'm sorry but this is drawing the line. I'm just hoping they will give me a whole new laptop instead. I don't know what else to say, I really want to love the laptop, it's great for the price and specs. But I'm questioning the purchase now. It's not about warranty service or the laptop itself, it's lifetime of the product, and I expected more than a year. I will update once I get my laptop back.UPDATE 2: I recently had to send my laptop in for a repair. The cpu fan seemed to not be working properly and it would overheat when running almost all my games. Fortunately it is still in warranty. I sent it about 3 days before Thanksgiving and due to The holiday it didn't get there until Monday following Thanksgiving. They repaired it. (Seems the replaced the motherboard, gpu and the keyboard. (I now have a Windows 8 style keyboard where the Start key isn't the older orb shape but is the newer windows logo) All in all, it took about 2 weeks due to holiday to get my laptop back. Which isn't really bad considering I live in Ohio and had to ship it all the way to Texas. I shipped via UPS ground with insurance (I am paranoid about that stuff.) Samsung shipped it back with 2 day Air. I was able to track both ways and knew when it would be coming so I was ready for it. The fix is good! Now I no longer overheat. Now I think that my issue was just a fluke as I don't see many with the issue, so I'm not taking any stars away and would in fact add a star for good customer support if I could. I still recommend this laptop. As you still get a good bang for your buck.UPDATE: Other have written that you can't turn down the brightness if you run the screen at 120Hz. This HAS been fixed! Download the latest video drivers from nvidia Geforce 310.33 beta or later and you CAN adjust the brightness level while on 120Hz. I already tried it with 310.33 beta and can confirm it works. Nvidia has also released another beta (310.54)today (November 12th, 2012) that I have yet to try, but can for sure say that the beta 310.33 works fine. So anyone who wants to adjust their brightness while on 120Hz, you can do so!On to the review now.I've owned quite a few gaming laptops, The Asus G73JH (I still have that one as a backup), Asus G53SW (I sold to get this one) are the closest in comparison. Though they are still decent gamer laptops. This one blows those out of the water. I have owned mine for close to 2 months now and don't have much to gripe about.Comparisons (These are comparing the differences of the Asus's and this Samsung one):* Asus used crappy Atheros Wifi cards in their laptops (I had to upgrade to in Intel card for better wifi. This one had an Intel in it already, I expected to have to change the wifi.* Both My Asus's cost a max of $1,200 but after upgrading the ram and adding a second hard drive as will as upgrading the wifi + any labor expenses they each cost as much as this Samsung.* All the laptops have a big rear. That's good for the cooling. 2 exhausts 1 is for the cpu and 1 is for the gpu. All laptops win in this category.* The Asus's felt a little cheaper built than this Samsung.* The Asus's Keyboards are of the chiclet style, this Samsung one offers something a little more traditional and feels great! A note on the G53SW and from what I have been reading all the  latest Asus Gamers seems to be a keyboard lag at times. When you type sometimes it would skip letters. This drove me crazy on the G53SW. To the point I ended up only using it's keyboard for  when I was in class. Not the case on the Samsung gamer. Typing is a dream.* I can't really compare specs since I'd be comparing 1-3 year old tech to now. But I'm a gamer, music maker, photo editor and video editor (student in the last 2) and this laptop has yet to  disappoint in any of the categories. What I thought was an awesome gaming experience on my other laptops was nothing!Negatives:I don't have much to gripe about and have been very happy with this laptop but if I would have to nitpick:* The glossy screen lid and screen are finger print magnates. Though a lot of manufactures use that stuff. It would have been nice to have a anti glare screen at least. But I'm used to it.  Considering I do a weekly cleaning and dusting of my laptops it doesn't bother me too much. I knew it would be this way by other reviews so I really can't gripe since I still bought it  knowing.* If you go to turn off Wifi with the shortcut button it turns off both wifi and bluetooth. It would have been nice to cycle or something like that. But I hardly use this function so it isn't a  big deal to me.* The power brick is large, so get a large bag for it. I'm used to large power bricks as the Asus gamers had large ones, so I can't complain on this. Ideally I would love a small power brick  but think about how much power this laptop needs. The power brick is a 200W one. My Asus's were 150W. On to any other thoughts:This laptop does get warm when under heavy use. But it's never been so hot that I can't touch it. It's to be expected. Look what's in it. The I73610 ivy bridge is comparable to one of the most powerful mobile i7 sandybridge's (last generation) The gpu is comparable to a Desktop GTX 560 (I believe but don't quote me on that). frankly I'm astounded at how well this laptop stays cool. Warm laptops aren't new to me as I've had gamer laptops before. But honestly this one actually is a little cooler. I use coretemp and msi afterburner to monitor the temps of the cpu and gpu respectively and they have been cooler than my older machines.I love the backlighting and how it changes colors for gaming mode. You can disable the screensavers that start up when you switch to gamer mode. It's under Mode Shift, then click Visual Effects.I like the design and coloring, it doesn't really scream \"I'm a gaming laptop!\" Unless you put stickers or stuff all over the lid. I wanted something I could potentially use for taking to a job someday that still had a lot of power and this works fine for that. The samsung label on the lid lights up like the Apple logo lights up on macbooks. Just as a side note.The 8GB Express Cache seems to work. I really can't tell other than things seem to run a little faster and boot up isn't bad. Better than my other laptops.The screen is a vibrant one. I've always liked Samsung TV's for their screens and the screen on this laptop doesn't disappoint.Battery runs for about 2 hours on normal use. Not much to write about. The battery is powering a lot of powerful components.Conclusion:One heck of a laptop, you get what you pay for, and that is a lot of bang! You could pay more for an Alienware or such and not get as good of specs (I know because I priced them at the time I bought this machine some were as high as $1000 more!) This is one heck of a machine and you can't go wrong with it. I've been happy and surprised at how will it performs, yeah I'm still getting surprised 2 months after I bought it.Notes:I wish to put the specs of my old laptops up for comparison to this one.Asus G73JH17.3\" 1600x900 displayCore i7 740QM 1.73GHZ turbo to 2.93GHZ8GB DDR3 Ram500GB 7200rpm and 640GB 5400rpm drivesIntel Wifi and bluetoothAti Radeon HD 5870m 1GB GDDR5Battery gets 1.5 hours if I'm lucky on normal use.Asus G53SW (Sold to buy the Samsung)15.4\" 1920x1080Core i7 2630QM 2GHZ turbo to 2.9GHZ14GB DDR3 Ram (upgraded by me)2x 500GB 7200rpm drives (2nd drive added by me)Intel 6230 Wifi and bluetooth (upgraded by me)Nvidia GTX 460M 1.5GB GDDR5Games I played on ALL machines: Torchlight, Command and Conquer Kane's Wraith, Sims 3, and Minecraft. They all played great and improved on each subsequent machine. Though Kane's Wraith couldn't do high detail on the G53SW when the nuke was fired. The Samsung has no problems. I didn't even buy Starcraft 2 until I bought the Samsung as I read people had issues with the 460M and SC:2. SC:2 plays at over 60Fps on the Samsung no problems. Minecraft would choke on some 256x and any 512x texture packs I tried on the G53SW though it was playable there were enough framerate drops for me to use only 128x or lower texture packs. Not so on the Samsung. I sued 512x packs and still got 60fps. (Contrary to belief you DO need a beefy gaming rig to play minecraft, ESPECIALLY with HD textures.Hope this helps and feel free to ask me any questions if you have them and I will help you to the best of my knowledge.

I've bought Asus laptops in the past (4 of them) but in the past 6 months I've gotten some Samsung products that made me want to get the Series 7 Gamer.  I've gotten the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, the Galaxy Tab 7.7 and a LED-TV.  Two things that are common in all of them - the screens are BEAUTIFUL.  I don't think anyone makes a more beautiful screen than Samsung!  And the quality of the finished product is really nice.  For the comments from others that are put-off on the design of the laptop lid - it's intentional - it's a design feature - no matter how many times you send it back you're going to get the same thing.  I think it looks pretty cool.Another reason I got this is 'cuz I love Windows 7 - and I'm not really looking forward to Windows 8.  I normally jump to the newest version (of most things in general, Windows in particular) but I'm not jumping this time.  I needed to update my laptop - I wanted to do it before Win8 comes out later this year - and the Series 7 Gamer, for me, was the way to do it.It's got enough memory to make everyone happy (16gb), it's got 2 big hard drives (750gb each - the C: drive is multi-partitioned to hold the recovery files), it has a BluRay drive and a good Nvidia graphics card, good sound .. exactly what I needed.

I've been using my work laptop (a dell precision m4600, 8mb ram, i7 processor, nor sure about video card) to play SWTOR and counterstrike: source and it was able to play on the highest settings but this thing blows it away.

In that even simple things like web-page text and images just jump out of the screen and are incredibly detailed and pin-sharp. The display is so bright and vibrant, that I normally like to have a break after 30-40mins of use...as my eyes tend to blur a little...Something I want to briefly mention whilst talking about the display when surfing, is how quickly it loads internet pages, and videos....I'm still using the same 10meg virgin fibre optic line as on my old laptop, and pages and images just load so much quicker, that I had to do a speed check on my line to see if the line speed had been increased...Another thing to note, is the speed of the laptops drives (2 x 750gig hard drives), with a 8gig SSD which seems to have windows pre-installed on it...which means windows 7 boots up in 22-24 seconds. So if you are regularly having to reboot the machine after having installed / Uninstalling programs (such as the quite frankly rubbish ` Norton's internet security' that comes pre-installed). It's not a chore restarting the machine, as it boots up so speedily...To put the speed of the drives into real-world usage perspective...I had to re-import my 1.1 terabytes of music back into iTunes on my old Pentium4 3.2ghz laptop a good few months ago....and I had to leave it overnight and it took (very approximately) 8-9 hours to fully re-import the library.....well, the Samsung did it in about just under 2 \u00bd hours....and that was whilst I was downloading an album, watching HD movies on gametrailers.com and generally surfing the internet with absolutely no drop in performance, to say I was shocked is an understatement. (admittedly this was mainly because it was now using USB 3.0 instead of USB 2.0 but it gives you a very rough idea of the speed, and it's multitasking abilities)It's also worth noting that the keyboard design is sublime....the keys have a real throw-back to the older style `Clicky' keyboards, where each of the keys feels weighted and clicks when you type, and you can really feel each press of the button, and the fact that the keyboard lights up (you can switch this off, or dim the brightness) you can work in the dark, or with minimal lighting (which I quite like to do). There has been some regular criticism of the track-pad on the keyboard...and I have to say that I can't stand track-pad's and I just plug a mouse into any laptop I use, so I can't comment on how good/bad it isSound is incredibly impressive for a laptop....most laptops sound leaves a lot to be desired, but this laptop has a excellent set of speakers (with a built in Sub-woofer) that produce surprisingly clear (and loud) sounds, straight-out-the-box. Don't get me wrong they're no substitute for a pair of really good laptop speakers, and I do intend to buy a pair...but the fact that I had keep turning the volume down as they were blaring out when I was watching videos...has made me think `Do I need a set of External speakers??'...There is plenty of connectivity, with two USB 3.0 ports (which is what your likely to plug your external drives into) two USB 2.0 ports (for mice/speakers)...and the usual collection of HDMI, VGA out, etc....that you'd expect to have on laptop..Did I really need a Laptop, with this much power in it?....not really....am I likely to be playing games regularly on it to make the most of the power?...very unlikely....and for what I use it for mainly (iTunes/organising my large amount of music/surfing the net/watching videos-trailer online) it's total overkill....but you know what...I absolutely love my laptop and I have absolutely no regrets buying it, and anything I throw at this laptop, it just laughs at me, as it just rips through any task thrown at it. And again I must re-iterate, that I haven't made use of the turbo-boosted `Gamer mode'...but everything I mentioned that I've done above, was done in the `Balanced' mode (`Normal' mode to me and you).This isn't a laptop that is designed to be taken places (maybe if you have a car...) but it's really a desktop replacement...and in that regards it more than delivers (as I don't really have the space for a desktop)...so you should really always look at having this thing running from the Power AC/mains, as there is a performance/frame rate hit, when running games from the battery. So I'll end in saying that this is (up to now) probably Samsungs most powerful laptop. And it compares extremely favourably with high-end: Origin, Asus, Alienware laptop's (only the dual graphic card Alienware, can comfortably outperform it). But the screen on this thing, is just astonishing (probably nothing high-end Mac users haven't seen before), but for the rest of us....this is a gamer-ready high-end laptop, that runs rings around (*most of...*) similarly priced \u00a31,000-\u00a31,400 laptops.P.s. Again, I have to mention, that I haven't had the chance to try any games on it yet..but the general consensus from the tons of reviews, I've read online about this laptop, is that it can play (pretty much) any current game with very high (to ultra, in some cases) resolution, with virtually all the effects turned on, with a still playable (30-60fps) depending on the game..", "Date": "July 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung Series 7 Gamer NP700G7C-S01US 17.3-Inch Laptop -Worth it?

I debated this purchase for about 2 months, looking at all of the different competitors' models, Toshiba, Dell, HP, and ASUS. For me it came down to Toshiba X875-7290 or this model.  I had to wait for over 6 weeks for the Toshiba model to finally hit the market, in the end; I went with the Samsung model.  (What you should know is that I own several High-end laptops already, I own 3 Toshiba Qosmio's systems and an earlier Dell Alien ware system, still went with this model based on the reviews that I had read!)Consideration 1 - For the money, this is about the most cost effective laptop and the least expensive model.  (I did not buy (this laptop) for this reason - it was just a strong selling point for me!)) Plenty of the competition that fell at the same price or slightly more expensive, had a weaker video card (important consideration), smaller HDD configuration or less system memory.Consideration 2- Display. I kept reading about the amazing display, I had to check it out for myself.  It is worth it, Resolution will match all others, but this display is bright, sharp and crisp.  It is the best display that I have seen on the high-end laptop. (Included without an upcharge.)Consideration 3 - Audio - well worth it - sound fantastic.  Beats all others that I have, you can play music in one room and hear it clearly in another!  (Not a technical review, true, but something that almost anyone can relate to.)  This is a laptop, and sounds are natural, loud and clear.Consideration 4 - Keyboard is fantastic.

Let me recomment about a few things.1. Hardware-still got a great look. Screen bright as ever. the keyboard feels much like that of the ones you actually buy separately, and comfort is the main strength for Samsung Gamer. I've used it for three weeks, and keyboard feels as if it's a part of you and built for you. The laptop is designed in a way that you go about 20 degrees above the surface of the desk so no wrist strain problems. It's aluminum(?) on the kayboard part and rest is plastic, but it doesn't feel super cheap, so don't worry.2. Mode dial-To be honest, I never use it because I'm currently using it mostly at home, and I'm not sure how much of use I'll have on this, but no harm not having it. Keyboard light turns white in balanced mode. Also heard a weird rumor that balanced mode performs better than gaming mode.3. Booting speed-As we know, there's ExpressCache 8GB, and there's no bluff. The booting takes about 10-20 seconds.4. HDDthere's dual 750GB HDD, thus 1.5TB. I've not enough money, so I can't get SSD yet, but I heard switching one of them to SSD would optimize the laptop.5. Sound-actually I also tried Chronos 17.3inch and ASUS G75VW-BBK5 and I returned ASUS right away after 5 minutes of Diablo. The sound quality of the speaker is just unmatchable to other laptops. It's got a great sound and well balanaced. The subwoofer doesn't give you the strong bass like a speaker (obviously), but it's definitely an ear candy.6. Gaming-According to review on notebookreview, GTX675M performs very well on most cases, and with the addition of i7 3rd gen, most of the plays so far flows smoothly. Other than some of the very demanding games like Metro 2333 (haven't tried) I assume, it will run amazingly well. Max Payne 3 ran on high no problem with some of the anti effects, etc. SC2 runs extreme 60fps, and D3 needless to say. As for D3, sometimes, I receive a lag spike, and I'm not sure if it's due to a ping lag, or HDD, but I set max fps to 60fps and I have no problem. Any games before 2012, you won't have problem running all on max setting and it will be good for more years to come.7. HeatWith relations to #6, I'm sure you guys are concerned with heating. The laptop comes with dual cooler, and the laptop does a great job with heat solving. There's a ventilation hole at the back and you can feel the hot air coming out. The keyboard and the laptop doesn't feel hot at all, although you find it very slightly warm, but considering how it was running very demandingly, you won't have any discomfort with regards to heat problems. Just make sure you have a good enough space at the back of the laptop for the hot air to come out properly.8. Portability-It is heavy. The adapter is 200W and is the size of a brick. In my case I'm used to Lenovo laptop I'm used to this brick. It is portable, but you will need a good carrying bag for this.9. Bloatware-they say bloatware, but they're all very helpful actually. you have the Easy Settings and Gaming mode settings to help you optimize your settings, and you can update them using easy software manager, or also delete them at your convenience.In overall, I wouldn't be able to find a high performance laptop with decent design, and amazing screen quality at this price point. I've done heavy research for two months. I've looked at Sager, Alienware, ASUS, MSI. Everything. I looked into all the youtube reviews, some I actually bought from Best Buy and gave it a go, and tried comparisons, but nothing can be compared to this laptop in terms of balance and spec, and price. I'd strongly advise you get it if you're looking for a gaming laptop. You won't be disappointed.--------------------------------------------------------------------bought this in replacement of samsung chronos 17.3inch (too much overheat for gaming), and I'm loving it.1. gaming-played bf3, max payne3, d3, sc2 and they all run maxed 1920x1080 fine, but truly maxing all (turning all effects and all on, will of course give some lower fps)2. everyday use-internet surfing fast, 16gb ram. double 750gb drives make convenient use. instant booting.3. portability-everyone says powerbrick is big, but for me it was alright because I've been too used to lenovo work machines. it's 200w power brick. laptop is indeed thick at the back side as there's dual cooler, but unlike my worries, it's not a monster that can't be carried, but still a bit heavy, but definitely portable.Definitely the best for the price you get in this range.", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Gaming PC", "Author": "Scottus", "ReviewID": "R145XIKF4RXRX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop a few weeks ago for multiple reasons as a personal computer at home and one I can take around with me and a gaming PC. The Samsung 7 series does all of that, its fast enough to handlegames, run a visual c++ compiler while having many IE and chrome windows open playing streaming music from youtube, netflix and facebook. This laptop so far has been the best PC investment I have ever had.When I recieved the package the laptop plugged in and started up no problems at all, Windows 7 comes setup and ready to go I loaded my applications and software and I was using for all intended purposes right off the bat.

Issues Here and There... Would You Still Buy It?", "Author": "M. A. Manabat \"Maverick\"", "ReviewID": "R44DVKWBYTLOQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung Series 7 GamerI previously have a Toshiba Satellite laptop which I gave to a family member (really just a way for me to justify buying a new laptop to my wife!).  There are so many options out there to consider but I ended up deciding on this one because of my budget and personal preferences when buying electronics.  Hopefully, my review will help someone decide whether this system is the right one for him/her.Things I like:* SPECS & PERFORMANCE:  The combination of features on this monster machine is just... for a lack of a better word... just AWESOME!  You put the specs found on this system on another brand and it'll probably cost you a few more bills.  I'm quite pleased that it is priced attractively.  I'll be using this laptop for years to come because of the included specs...  the awesome GTX 675M, 16GB RAM (yes 16GB on a laptop!), full 17.3-inch LED full HD 1080P screen, 3rd generation Intel Core i7... and much more.This system is FAST and it pretty much replaced my desktop PC.  Everything just loads quicker, its processing power cuts down the waiting for things to finish.  Video and photo editing is a breeze... it makes you get things done much faster.  I'm not a hardcore gamer and did not buy this system for that sole reason.  I bought this laptop because I don't have time upgrading systems... I like buying things that will remain relevant and useful for at least a few years before I have to upgrade again.  This laptop is maybe more than what I needed but it is definitely something I wanted.* STORAGE:  Lots of storage here... 1.5TB HDD 7200RPM.  It's actually two 750GB drives.  I like this setup as it allows me to have system files and installs on one drive and all my personal files on the other.  It also has 8GB SSD (Solid State Drive) which helps on booting performance.* SCREEN:  The screen is bright, vivid, sharp... just beautiful... believe what everyone here is saying; it's one of the best monitors I've seen.  It is in full 1080p HD glory - bluray movies are amazing on this screen.  Samsung really does know its screens...  I actually have to lower down the brightness more than halfway when using the laptop at night; it is blindingly bright and vivid! Keeping it at a brighter level usually strains my eyes.* BOOT UP PERFORMANCE:  Booting up is really fast!  It only takes approximately 20-23 seconds to reach the login screen.  This is really an eye opener compared to my 3-year old desktop which takes 1.5 minutes to boot up.  The 8GB SSD ExpressCache technology is no joke.  It works as advertised.  This is one of the main reasons I've transferred all my essential programs to this laptop and made it my main PC .* FULL SIZE KEYBOARD:  I like the full size backlit (adjustable) keyboard... great for dark rooms or at night.  Typing on it feels comfortable and the keys operates smoothly, not sure how to explain it but it makes me type faster, feels like my fingers are gliding on the keys...  It is almost as good as typing on my Logitech k800.  Some of the keys are located differently than your typical desktop keyboard but I got used to it with more use.  Since it's a full size keyboard, it includes the number pad - which is very useful to me as I do my personal finance on this laptop.* COOLING SYSTEM:  The laptop runs relatively cool when gaming for long sessions.  The dual fans located on the back of the system effectively redirects hot air towards the back end.  During extended gaming, the keyboard will feel warm but not hot.  The glass strip located just above the keyboard (where the power button sits) does get hot to the touch... much warmer than the keyboard.  I did notice that the left side of the laptop runs warmer than the right side - it's probably because the GPU is located there.  You can comfortably place the laptop on your lap when doing less intensive work (net surfing, word etc).  The dual fans are really effective.* SPEAKERS:  The speakers are actually good.  Not as good as dedicated 2.1 systems or a decent pair of headphones but better than your typical built-in laptop speakers.  It comes with Dolby Surround Sound software that surprisingly works well during movie playback.  Nice sound effects.* BLOATWARE:  Although I uninstalled some bloatware, I actually like a few of what Samsung included with this laptop.  Some are useful - \"Easy Software Manager\" which helps keep programs/drivers updated - \"Easy Settings\" helps to easily make system changes - \"Easy Support Center\" that helps with troubleshooting.  The laptop also comes with 60 days of Norton Internet Security (hint: it resets when you restore your system to factory settings)* FAN NOISE:  With all the muscle under the hood... I'm really surprised that it runs pretty silent.  Under long gaming sessions, you will hear a low \"hum\" but nothing like the high pitch noise I get my from my desktop.  You probably won't even notice the fan noise if you have anything playing on the speakers...Things I do not like:* WIDI FEATURE:  My biggest issue with this laptop is the advertised WiDi feature - it simply does not work!  This system is WiDi \"ready\" but will not work from the getgo!  The software required to get WiDi working is not preinstalled on the system, you simply can't google the software and download it off the web, you have to contact Samsung support and get it from them because of driver issues.When it comes to Samsung support, well, good luck with that!  The first time I contacted Samsung, some uninformed rep insisted that this laptop does not even support WiDi!  After convincing him otherwise, the rep wasn't even able to find me the WiDi software!  The second time I called was a little better... the support person was able to find the software (took him a while though) but in the end, the WiDi software that he made me download wouldn't work.  The program wouldn't even install at first and after it did (after much troubleshooting), my laptop still couldn't connect to the TV adapters I bought (from Belkin and Netgear).  I've given up on this feature...  They might have the correct hardware installed but I'm convinced that they don't have the correct drivers to run WiDi.  I'm hoping a future update from both Samsung and Intel will fix this issue.* CARD READER:  The card reader wouldn't read my 64GB SDXC card, (no problem with other SD types) the same card works with my 3-year old card reader installed on my desktop so I know the issue lies with the card reader.  The driver for the card reader is up to date and once again Samsung does not have an answer but to imply the SDXC card is to blame... lame.* BUILD QUALITY:  I wished the lid was made out of brushed metal or something similar and not plastic - it cheapens the look of the product.  For $1800, I wished they made the lid more aesthetically pleasing.  The area surrounding the keyboard is covered by brushed metal but it is easily scratched!  Make sure not to wear your stainless steel watch to avoid scratching this metal plating.  Don't get me wrong, the laptop, by all means do not look cheap or ugly... just saying they could've done more to polish it up.* WEBCAM:  The 2-megapixel webcam seems like an afterthought.  It performed poorly in low light conditions and has horrible white balance.  You need to have a good light source to have decent results.  You should seriously invest in a better webcam if you will be using this laptop often for Skype or something similar.* WEIRD GLITCHES:  I have desktop shortcut icons running along the bottom of my screen (I don't like placing them on my taskbar) and whenever I close and quickly open the lid of my laptop, these shortcut icons would always move one row up.  All my drivers are current... so I don't know what's causing this glitch... it's irritating.  There would also be times when the volume controls would not respond when I manually adjust it on the touch buttons - this usually happens right after booting up, so I'm guessing this might have something to do with drivers still in the process of loading.Things I would also like to add:* SCREEN REFRESH RATE:  You won't find this mentioned in any of the marketing data for this laptop but you can actually set the screen refresh rate to 120Hz.  Some, if not most, hardcore gamers prefer their monitors at 120Hz since its display will be smoother, crisper, more responsive...  Great for FPS games or something that requires fast movements.  120Hz monitors usually comes with a hefty price tag as well...  I tried using this refresh rate and found my games looking a little crisper but did not notice much else.  My games were already running smoothly in 60Hz.  One thing I did notice was that you can't lower down the brightness of the monitor when using the 120Hz refresh rate - it remains at full blast (don't know if it's another glitch).  I had to switch back to 60Hz because of this... the monitor is just blindingly bright!  It strains my eyes since I mostly game/use the laptop at night.  It's probably better suited to use during daytime or in bright environments.  Although, I don't use it, it's good to know it's there.* POWER BRICK:  Like what everyone is saying... the power brick is quite big.  Its measurement is approximately 1.5 x 3.5 x 6.5 inches and will add about 2lbs to your total carry weight.  The laptop is almost 9lbs, so we're talking about 11-12lbs on your shoulders (or your back) minimum.* DIAL MODE:  There are four different modes: Game (everything on high), Balanced, Library (reduces fan noise and disables sounds and lights) and Green (battery saving).  What can I say... people say the dial is just a gimmick but I kinda like it... it adds personality to the system and it's cool to look at.  Anyways, I personally leave it on gaming mode... I really don't see any reason to move the dial since it's easy enough to change settings.  Some online reviews actually indicate slightly better benchmark scores when the dial is set to \"Balance Mode\".  But I personally like the blue backlight on the keyboard while on \"Game Mode\", instead of white from \"Balanced Mode\".* TOUCH SENSITIVE BUTTONS:  There are touch sensitive buttons on a glass covered strip located just above the keyboard.  There's the mute button, wifi on/off, keyboard backlit on/off and the volume up/down.  There's also a LED light that just says Turbo in the middle of the glass strip, this is merely eye candy - it doesn't do anything.  The power button is also located on this glass strip but is not touch sensitive.  Personally, I think they should have switched the volume and the dial mode controls... I would think that it's more intuitive to turn up or down your volume using a dial instead of buttons...* WEI SCORE:  Also known as Windows Experience Index.  WEI assesses key system components on a scale of 1.0 to 7.9  These are my current WEI scores:  Processor: 7.6 Memory: 7.7  Graphics: 7.6  Gaming Graphics: 7.6 Primary Hard Disk: 5.9  These numbers fluctuate depending on system state.  Brand new out of the box, my scores were mostly 7.8s and 7.9s for all of them except for Primary HD which always scored 5.9* GAMES:  I run all my games on the highest settings and this laptop delivered great performance.  It was able to handle everything I threw at it.  Some of my games are CIV IV, Diablo 3, Guild Wars, Sims 3, Shogun 2 and some other older titles... they all ran beautifully.* TOUCHPAD:  The touchpad is of the multi-touch variety.  You can use gestures to make it do different things... sorta like how you would control an iPhone.  You can pinch (zoom in/out), swipe, flick... etc.  But I have the touchpad disabled since I found it too sensitive.  Maybe I'm just not use to it but I have always preferred using a mouse.This Series 7 Gamer is Samsung's first foray into the gaming market.  And in my opinion, they did an excellent job!  Even with its negatives, I would not hesitate to recommend this system for anyone looking for a high end system that is reasonably priced.  Like what other owners say about this laptop... the positives far outweighs the negatives.  And yes, it is worth buying!", "Date": "August 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Gaming Laptop, Excellent Value", "Author": "Notor", "ReviewID": "R2U0W3E3VVU1Z9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "EDIT: Thought I'd give a year update on my purchase. After almost 12 months, it's still rocking. This is the best computer I've ever owned; not once in 12 months of continuous gaming and use has it locked up/froze/blue screened etc. It still boots rapidly and can handle anything. I can have both Dota 2 and Civ 5 up on max settings and tab instantly between the two while having other programs/browser open. It's really been great gaming laptop and it still seems that for it's price point you aren't going to find a better value as far as specs go. Yes, you can get better specs if you are willing to pay $600-1000 more, but for what you get as well as the build quality and stability, this remains unparalleled. It's unfortunate that you no longer can pick between the Windows 7 and 8 versions, but I was able to get mine when it was Windows 7-only so I don't have that problem. All in all, just a great computer, and it has maintained the same level of performance and quality over the 12 months that I've owned it. I don't gush often on products but this one really warrants it.This is a great laptop. Purchased it as a desktop replacement because I need the mobility of a laptop for school as well as the power of a solid gaming rig. This thing rocks, especially for the price. I'll try to run through some of the highlights.Screen: Incredible. The best display I've seen on a laptop.Hardward: Excellent. If you are looking at this computer you are a serious gamer who does their homework, so you know this thing is packing. Only downside is it comes with the GTX 675m and not the new Radeon 7990 or whatever but it's destroying whatever I've thrown at it. Dota 2 and Diablo 3 both run on max settings flawlessly. 16gb of RAM is obscene, same with the 1.5TB HDD.Build: Really great. It has an excellent full keyboard with sturdy, robust keys. Backlighting is nice and easily turned off. It doesn't get very hot, at least from my experience. The mode dial isn't cheesy either, its really nice to be able to switch between different power settings quickly, although the default skins were kinda lame, but easy to turn off.Negatives: Glossy finish is a huge fingerprint magnet. Battery life is about 3.5hrs on energy saver. Wish some of the casing could've been metal, but I suppose the plastic keeps the weight down. Touch sensitive volume key is pretty stupid.All in all it's an awesome gaming laptop, especially at where it's priced. I've had it for about 3 weeks and it's been just awesome, I'm really pleased with how it's turned out.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop for a Great Price", "Author": "Matthew S.", "ReviewID": "R2IULF2XDVEM0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a college student, majoring in Web programming and design, so I needed a computer that could handle the endless actions of Web design and coding. In addition, I am a hardcore gamer, and I wanted a PC that could handle demanding games. I would have bought a desktop, but I needed a portable computer. The Samsung Series 7 Gamer does exactly what I need it to, and I am happy with my purchase.- SOFTWARE - 9/10The Samsung Series 7 Gamer (S7G) comes with some bloatware, which are programs that are not required and sometimes are undesired by the user of the computer. For example, like most PCs, the S7G comes pre-installed with Norton Antivirus, which is one of the VERY WORST anti-virus programs available - seriously, if you're using Norton, I highly recommend a better anti-virus, such as Kaspersky or BitDefender.Anyways, with this bloatware installed, there is not a major problem with uninstalling them. There are a few helpful programs used by Samsung, such as Easy Settings, which allows users to control screensaver settings, sleep settings, screen brightness, mode settings, etc. These applications can be easily uninstalled if not wanted, so don't worry about that.I have the Adobe Web Design Collection and Microsoft Office 2010 installed, and my S7G runs them all like a champ. I have no problem at all running Photoshop, Illustrator, Fireworks, Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, and a even a game at the same time.- OPERATING SYSTEM - 10/10Currently, as of March 2013, Windows 7 is better than Windows 8, plain and simple. I made sure that my S7G came with Windows 7 because I did not like the tablet-esque functionality of Windows 8, and there are ALWAYS tons of bugs in new operating system launches.If you decide to get the S7G or any other PC, I recommend Windows 7, whether it is Home Premium, Professional, or Ultimate.- HARDWARE - 8/10Ah, hardware. If you are looking at the S7G, you are most likely looking into its hardware specs. I was in the same boat, comparing laptops and which one was better. As far as hardware goes, Alienware laptops are more powerful, but they are also a lot more expensive. In fact, the S7G is a great deal for what it can do. For most laptops around the S7G's hardware specs, the price would be more for other laptops.I looked at MSi laptops, Alienware laptops, ASUS laptops, and even desktops! I found more powerful laptops, but the other laptops were either not as powerful or more expensive. The S7G has some serious hardware on its own, too! 16GB of RAM makes this baby fly; an i7 3610QM at 2.30GHz allows for a lot of processing; and an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 675M graphics card provides top-notch gaming graphics. I have several games on my S7G:Skyrim - Max Settings and Graphics-enhancing ModsOblivion - Max Settings and Graphics-enhancing ModsGTA IV - Max Settings and Graphics-enhancing ModsEVE Online - Max SettingsMinecraft - Max SettingsSimCity - Max SettingsCivilization IV - Max SettingsBattlefield: Bad Company 2 - Max SettingsBattlefield 3: Max SettingsThere is also a nifty feature in the Easy Settings application that allows your computer to run the screen at 120Hz, instead of 60. In terms of hardware, you will not find a better deal on what the S7G offers for its price. Other laptops will run over $2,000 for the same specs.- PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS - 7/10I will be honest: this laptop is a mammoth. From the huge brick (6\" long and 3\" wide) to the 17.3\" screen, this puppy is meant to be big. Including the brick, the laptop weighs about 12 pounds, so do not expect to be carrying it around all the time, unless you can handle that kind of extra weight on you. By no means is the laptop a hindrance to me, but I am also young.Like many others have said, this laptop screen is incredible! It seriously is better than almost every laptop screen on the market. Colors are vibrant, the textures are crisp, and the screen can be set to very bright. You will not be disappointed in the screen.The mode switcher on the right side of the laptop is very useful, in my opinion. To some, it may seem like a gimmick, but I enjoy being able to switch my laptop into different modes, depending on if I want to save power, prevent the fans from running to loud in a library, or set the computer to Beast Mode and tear some games apart.The back-lit keyboard is great, too. While in Gamer Mode, the keyboard is blue, with red around the W, S, A, D buttons; in the Balanced Mode, the keyboard is white around the entire keyboard. It is a great assistance when typing in the dark. The keys feel very crisp and sound like the old school laptop \"clicking\" sounds, and the keys are a tiny bit inverted, allowing for great comfort and precision.The built-in mouse is great and can have its settings changed, such as the page-scrolling speed, the tap-on-keyboard click, the zoom feature, and more. I use an external mouse, but the built-in mouse is not a problem to use in those tight situations.The fans are extremely quiet and only sound like the computer will explode when running a graphics-intensive game. Other than that, be prepared to be amazed at its ninja-like quiet.One thing I do not like is how warm the laptop gets on the underside, near the top-left: if left on bare skin, the laptop will get very hot! Other areas are fine, though, including on the sound-adjusting button.Another \"problem\" some might address is the quality of the laptop's shell. For a $2,000 laptop, one would expect a titanium-alloy shell like a MacBook Pro, but this laptop uses a harder-than-usual plastic shell. The shell is not bad in my opinion, but some might prefer something more durable for an expensive piece of hardware. Additionally, the S7G shell IS a fingerprint magnet - clean it often.- PROS -\u2022 Runs multiple programs with no problem\u2022 Can handle most current-gen games\u2022 Surprisingly quiet, unless running a demanding game\u2022 Love the keyboards feel\u2022 The mouse is not an issue to use but recommend an external mouse for any laptop\u2022 The mode switch does not seem \"gimmicky\" to me but a welcomed feature\u2022 Some bloatware, but it can be uninstalled easily\u2022 Windows 7 has no issues; I would recommend staying away from Windows 8 until 2014 (debugging purposes)\u2022 Contains high-end hardware and can do almost any job you throw at it\u2022 Has a sweet light up Samsung symbol on the back- CONS -\u2022 Hard-plastic shell for a $2,000 laptop might be a slight turnoff for some\u2022 The laptop is a fingerprint magnet - clean it often\u2022 This laptop is heavy: 12 pounds\u2022 Short battery life\u2022 Desktops are recommended for pure gaming PCs, so do not get any laptop if you only plan on playing games\u2022 Does not come with current driver updates - if you get the S7G, make sure you update the drivers!I have had my laptop for over a month, and I will update this review if needed.

I considered getting a 15 MBP, but I was drawn towards the Ivy Bridge of the Samsung laptop. The fact is, you get more bang for your buck with the Blu ray player, 16gb of RAM, 1.5 TB HD and not to mention the screen (samsung produces some of the apple screens for laptops).

Pulled out the system drive and added a Samsung 830 - 256GB SSD. I install a fresh install of Win 7 Pro and loaded all of my software which consists mainly of video & photo editing as well as many plugins for the software. Also installed quite a few large engineering programs. I have about 75GB left over of free space on the system drive. The Samsung runs all of this software like butter, very smooth with no crashes. The notebook is quiet and fast! Runs cool with everything I've thrown at it, although I've not tested it with any games as of yet. I have the 2nd 750GB 7200rpm drive for use as a data drive for photos, video, documents etc. I also setup a secure zone with Acronis for secure backups. So far I love this laptop. It's keyboard has a good feel. Love the number pad on right. That was a must when I was looking for a new notebook. Backlit keyboard functions well although a little more flex on the left hand side than expected. The screen is beautiful and very bright. At 1920x1080 the screen is readable even though it's text is small factory set at 125%, and I usually need glasses to see the text of that size but don't on this setup. Some of the Samsung bloatware is actually fairly usefull. Downloads and notifies of updates for all of the drivers when needed, system settings etc. Left out some of the backup stuff as I use Acronis. All drivers from Samsung actually work, unlike some other manufacturers out there in this same catagory. Windows has no issues with any equipment after install. Say it again, This computer WORKS, no problems with drivers, keyboards, trackpad etc. which is alot more than I can say about some other gamer systems after reading their reviews. Have seen some reviews of trackpad sensitivity issues. You must read the manual! It is highly configurable for sensitivity as well as other items. Even has a sensitivity setting for brushing the pad with your palm when typing. Works very well on mine. Overall this is a well built notebook. Not built as rugged as my old Dell M90 but by todays standards it's solid. Wouldn't want to drop it though. One screw on bottom to access both hard drives as well as memory. Would have liked access to the fans for cleaning a little easier, but not too bad. The bios is basic but has most functions. If you're for a tweaking machine to jack around this is not your notebook. If you want a notebook that so far is rock solid, it's a good buy.Would purchase a Samsung again based on my first few weeks impression.

That said, the series 7 gamer is much more simplistic if you constantly want to switch modes, making it so you don't have to know as much about computers to do so.  I'll throw you a few pros and cons in an easier to read format.Pros: It is a fast and powerful beast. I was expecting a marvelous screen since this laptop is made by Samsung and I wasn't disappointed to say the least. It is very simplistic to switch between modes on this computer because of the dial.  Overall there aren't many cons, but there are a few.  Cons:  AT this price I would have loved to see an SSD and maybe a 3D display like the international model, but I cant take anything off for that because I knew going into it that neither of those were included.  As with most laptops the Series 7 Gamer, when unplugged, goes into more of a power saving mode causing the graphics quality to drop rapidly, but the solution is to just wright your own power plan.  It was a quick fix so no stars off for that either. I think it is ugly, but beauty is completely a matter of opinion plus all gaming laptops, in my opinion, except an elect few, are ugly.  As with all gaming laptops, it's heavy but I guess this could be considered a pro because then it saves you some time at the gym.. No more weightlifting for me.  Overall I love this laptop and would/do recommend it, but there are some cheaper alternatives with comparable specs.

It was a little bit lighter than some (although still clocking in at a hefty 8.5lbs or so, but not the 11.5lbs of the Alienware) and it had a great screen from everything that I read. The only concern was the heat that people complained about, especially on the volume control.Although the volume control gets hot, it doesn't get too hot to use, although it is not entirely comfortable either. However, generally that isn't too much of a problem.The one annoyance that I've found is that the touch controls at the top of the keyboard for things like wireless, sound and such is a little annoying. Also, the dial to change the laptop from one setting to another is interesting. The first thing I did was turn off any animations when switching.Overall, I'm very happy with this laptop and even though it's on the heavier side, it's actually not all that bad given that my work laptop is 6.5lbs.

Even with the defect on the back, I am not actually too upset since the display is so clear and bright. This display is even better than the Dell XPS 17 3D display which is considered among the best.2. Excellent cooling System! Stays very cool and quiet.3. Good quality keyboard4. Good Trackpad5.Pretty sleek and solidly built. It's not the prettiest laptop and it is rather plain, but that is actually a plus since many don't want something too flashy6. The specs are amazing and rival almost any laptop, particularly its GTX 675M card.7. Good Build Quality. The computer feels very solid even with the plastic components.Cons1. Lots of Plastic all over computer2. Sound System is not the best. This laptop sound system cannot match Dell's XPS lineup and therefore cannot beat HP Envy's laptop lineup. MSI GT series has Dynaudio and is usually considered among the best as well. If you want a gaming laptop with top notch sound quality, this Samsung fails at it. The sound quality is good, but definitely not great. For $1900 it should be much better and they should have placed more emphasis on it.3. Wifi connectionThis is definitely a very good laptop that would be scored about 85/100 which is being pretty generous considering its flaws. The price will most likely come down since not many people will buy it due to Samsung's recent entry into the gaming laptop business and its price point. The laptop would sell much better at about $1599.  If they would put a better sound system and improve the exterior materials and cut the ram and sell it for about $1250-$1400 it would be very competitive with the Asus G75 and Alienware products.Samsung should not have the one size fits all mentality and if they do, they will not get the sales they need. Furthermore, if this is what they have to do, at least put a top notch sound system and use better quality materials for this price and it would be winner. Keep updating it with the top of the line graphics cards and keep it top of the line. Samsung's expertise in displays definitely helps make this product viable, but the shortcomings I mentioned need to be addressed quickly to boost sales and keep buyers happy.*** The back of the laptop is just not tolerable. Wifi is choppy for this as well. It is returned. I will get a replacement, but just nervous about taking a chance on another defective panel again. The speakers also distort rather quickly. Maybe I just got a defect. I am pretty disappointed about the fit and finish, it should have been inspected better by Samsung or the company that makes it.Bottom Line: The laptop cannot match others in its class when it comes to audio quality. This is probably one of the biggest negatives of the laptop. Most people can tolerate the cheap plastics, but mediocre audio is simply unacceptable. If laptops less than half its price can have better audio quality, than Samsung has some issues to address. The subwoofer is very small, not even as big as the Dell XPS 15's and speakers are weak. I know people can add speakers but it is hard to disregard the issue when other laptops in the class have better audio for a lower price. Is the audio really detrimental to the gameplay experience? Not too much, but you definitely  notice the lack of bass,etc.As stated, the display is among the best of any laptop on the market. It is a very bright display with very good contrast. I did notice the computer can be a little slow when it comes to adjusting volume and brightness using function and control keys at times. This is not a big issue but should be addressed. When the display turns off while laptop is still on and you touch the trackpad to wake, it takes about 3x longer than almost any laptop. People who own this laptop know what I mean.Nevertheless, I will still be generous and give the laptop a score of 85/100. Case quality does not compare to Alienware or Asus. However, it does match or exceed them when it comes to display quality, and cooling system, and good quality keyboard.
