It's very light which is really nice if you need to carry it around. Set up was really simple. I have no problem running multiple programs on it at once and Windows 7 functions very well with the computer.The keyboard is comfortable and the function keys at the top that adjust volume, screen brightness and wifi connection work really well and are very convenient.The only small con I have discovered about the laptop would be the mousepad. The keys can be a little difficult to push compared to my prior laptop (a Dell Inspiron) so that took a little getting used to but now I hardly notice it.One last observation: this laptop seems like it was created to look like a macbook which I really like. If you're looking for a much cheaper alternative to a macbook, this computer will do you wonders.If I had to do it all over again, I would purchase this computer over any others.", "Date": "July 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Notebook greatly improved my productivity.", "Author": "Paul R.

It is much faster and more stable.  My only complaint is with the touchpad.  It was somewhat difficult to get comfortable with.  If you are not looking at it, it is difficult to tell if you finger is actually on it.  Also, if you are not exactly within the touchpad area, the functionality is sometime different and sometimes inexplicable.  I have overcome this by using a wireless mouse most of the time.  I would still recommend this notebook as very fast and an affordable alternativer.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "HP G42-410US 14 inch Notebook PC", "Author": "Mary,", "ReviewID": "RK9UZFWML4AL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a birthday gift for my husband.
