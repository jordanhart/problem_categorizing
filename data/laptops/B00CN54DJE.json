I purchased this for gaming after reviewing every other gaming laptops and got it a few days ago.The best thing I noticed is that the Supreme Performance with Awesome Cooling System that keeps it super cool even after playing continuous hours of graphic intense games and thing is absolutely silent. I recommend this product for everyone who wants the best value for your money. This thing got a stunning solid design and build quality is excellent.This is a newer model BHI7N11. Every thing worked fine for me. Perfect for Gaming. Came with Windows 8. I played Battlefield 3 with all setting tuned to ULTRA and works smoothly without even upgrading to latest graphic drivers. Latest Games can run on ULTRA settings without any heat or noise. Sound quality is awesome. Display has great viewing angles. It can even run games smoothly under battery. 1TB 5400RPM HDD is perfectly alright and is able to boot in to Windows 8 in 9 seconds. The GTX 670MX has the latest Kepler architecture that can perform well on the latest gaming titles.ASUS is really the choice of champions.PROS +----------+ Best Cooling System & Super Silent+ Supreme Performance+ Awesome HD Display with brilliant viewing angles+ Great Sound Quality and Sub woofer+ Large TouchPad and Smooth TouchPad Keys+ Fast Boot in 9 seconds+ Awesome full Size Keyboard+ Great DVD drive & latest portsCONS -- Honestly Nothing----------- Some users may feel its bit heavy.

It's basically a desktop replacement. All the power you need to render videos, play games or what have you. It boots fast since there is a caching SSD with the large 1TB HDD. The graphics card is good enough you can play all new AAA titles. That's amazing for a laptop.
