Well that is great, seriously great. The down side is...he ships it with a windows xp service pack 2 recovery disk! Leads to a lot of potential problems. Basically as soon as you get the computer, restore it with your XP SP2 cd. The thing is!!!! First download all your drivers online to a thumb drive or cd if possible, or else...your done for. Don;t know what I am talking about? Then never buy one of these!Used computers in general are not for the computer beginner to intermediate, a serious background in knowledge is needed for some of the subtler things that come up unexpected. I'm talking about more than just inserting a disk. Especially if you are going to add office, or other software, or even have to type in a foreign language. Take my advice, don;t buy from him UNLESS YOU ARE VERY very very good with computers and troubleshooting them. Serious, this is not an angry review to \"ruin\" him, it's the facts and good advice, I hope you will take and avoid lost time and money, most importantly stress.Now thirdly...cd drive worked the first evening I got the computer. Next day, running my software fine and...*chirp* *slow scan* *chirp* *dead silence....ok the drive went dead!!! So...I go and buy an external dvd/cd drive, another $60. What was a seemingly fair deal turned out to just be, \"you get what you pay for\". A little suspect that the drive works for a few hours and then dies. Not making accusations that he is a crook, however he does have to make a profit somewhere. Sold me junk, I could have got off a popular auction site for about $30, I thought Amazon would have some integrity as it is sold through them...guess I was wrong. Buyer beware.Overall would rather buy from someone else, however, with some tweaking and a lot of know how, this being the second day, I think I have things worked out. All this seller does is buy used laptops off the internet, set them up with an SP3 back-up disk he has and ship them out to you...for better or for worse....", "Date": "June 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "del", "Author": "F Javier magana", "ReviewID": "R2AD0XLF8INGTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this computer is working great, my cousin is happy with, it has a lot of programs and he is using them, thanks", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "This company is great!Will definitely buy something from them again!", "Author": "SarahWinkles", "ReviewID": "R290ZQAOZNVEPY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my laptop in a timely fashion,and it was just as described!I love it!Thank you guys so very much for everything!", "Date": "December 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Used Dell Computer", "Author": "Judy E.
