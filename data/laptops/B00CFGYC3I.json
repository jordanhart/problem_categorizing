The internal wifi card has severe issues with connectivity....if you get some 4 meters away from your router the signal drops entirely. Sony's message boards are flooded with people who bought any one of sony's 2013 laptops and they are all complaining about the wifi issue. You can easily fix it with an usb wifi dongle or you could even replace the internal card...but that's not acceptable for a new product.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony, A nice compact unit", "Author": "Donald Drudzinski", "ReviewID": "R14I68IFA6X5BS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Outstanding  !!!

But its looks deceived me. The second day I got the laptop, my internet stopped working for like an hour when my brother' s and sister's internet on their laptops worked perfectly fine. It kept on disconnecting and connecting for a week. I couldn't it take it anymore so I returned it. If only the internet worked, it would have been the perfect laptop for me...", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good,  not perfect", "Author": "mb", "ReviewID": "R2UNFNWUCO2YVG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop here, on Amazon, and everything about the purchase process was great. It actually arrived a day earlier than estimated, so no complaints there. I was able to connect it to internet right away. I like the whole appearance, it's a very good looking laptop. The keyboard feels very nice and the touchscreen is very responsive. The computer is fast enough for what I do, which isn't much though. I check my emails, read some newspapers, a little bit of Facebook and sometimes watch a TV show or a movie. I also use Skype to keep in touch with my family. Which brings me to the reason I only gave it 3 stars: the internet drops off sometimes and I know it's the computer's wireless, not the actual internet. It doesn't last long, only for a minute or so, but it's enough to interrupt my calls. It's really very annoying especially considering that you pay almost $200 more than you would pay for a different brand.Update (02/01/2014): A couple of months ago, after I switched internet providers (I don't know if that's relevant), the computer's wireless dropped again and a small window opened on my screen asking me if I wanted to fix the problem. I clicked \"Yes\" and I've never had a problem again. I guess it was a software problem. I upgraded the rating from 3 stars to 4 stars. Also, I recently bought an iPod nano 7th generation and after not being recognized by iTunes or My Computer, one of the drivers needed to be reinstalled. Since I'm no computer guy, I had to take it to the Geek Squad and it cost me $30.00. Like I said in the title: good, not perfect.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love my pink", "Author": "Kimberley Wyatt", "ReviewID": "RSK4R00FKQNWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Laptop has everything I wanted and the color pink.

Track pad could be better.", "Author": "Girlygirl", "ReviewID": "RYZR2ECSL6084", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We bought this for our 14 year old daughter for Christmas. She loves it. She loves the touch screen. I haven't used it but she seems to love everything about it. My husband thinks the track pad could be better. It is hard to click but I guess if you use the touch screen it is not necessary to use the track pad. My daughter likes the color but I would prefer purple. Overall, I think it is a good computer for a teen. It is not too heavy and the price point is pretty reasonable for the power it has.

Started having problems day one. I was on the phone daily with Sony support for one problem or another. First, the wi-fi connection always said limited. Whether I was at home or in a public place, it had trouble picking up a connection. I have two other computers in my house and neither one of them have wi-fi problems, so I know it isn't my router. As a result, I was constantly kicked off the internet. Then I realized that none of the tiles worked. Every tile I clicked on said \"app cannot be opened or app not available.\" Then the computer would not shut down or restart. The Sony technician gave multiple suggestions and nothing worked. Finally she told me I needed to either send the computer for repair or return it where I purchased it. I promptly returned the computer. I had the laptop 8 days and had this much trouble. My eight year old Toshiba hasn't had the first problem. Guess I'll buy another Toshiba. I will NEVER buy another Sony.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.99", "Features": "Intel Core i3-3227U\n4 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n14-Inch Touch-enabled Screen", "Name": "Sony VAIO Fit Series SVF14213CXB 14-Inch Core i3 Touch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JrwtlF7NL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CFGYC3I"}}
