{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Midrange Touchscreen Windows 8 Laptop you can get", "Author": "Malice", "ReviewID": "R2OT2LLHU1BDWV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now that I have had a few days to mess around with this laptop, I feel like it is worth letting everyone know how great it is.  I guarantee you, once you move to a touch screen laptop you will never want to go back.The device is very quick to power on, and unlock some other laptops I have had it is very quick to shift between standby and operational.  When I am done I simply close the lid and it goes to sleep conserving power very quickly.  When I'm ready to use it again, I flip it open, tap the space bar and it is ready to go after entering my password.  I no longer feel the need to keep it plugged in constantly like I have with my previous laptops.The bottom of the laptop is a very hard plastic, presumably to make it more comfortable in you lap, although it does blow out warm air after using it for awhile.  It isn't uncomfortable, but I am considering getting a laptop cooler to set it on for extended use.  The lid and upper part are a brushed metal and looks very nice.  It is probably the most aesthetically pleasing Acer I have had.Unlike my previous laptops, the keys are all isolated from one another and protrude through the single piece brushed metal top.  I think this makes it much more durable than your average keyboard for a laptop, although I shudder to think of the pain to replace a key if you every do have an issue.  I don't think it will be a problem, and I do like the keyboard and layout, along with the full number pad to the right.  It also has a mousepad at the bottom, although I don't find myself using that too much.The touch screen is great!  It is very responsive and apparently supports multi-touch up to 10 fingers, although I can't imagine when I would need to utilize that.  This is big selling point of the laptop.  Windows 8 is the best OS Microsoft has put out, so long as you have a touch screen.  Most everything about it is very intuitive, and I find myself transition between tasks much easier than on previous versions of Windows.The computer comes ready to go without too much bloatware on it.  I have yet to find any annoying apps that I had to immediately get rid of.  I have gotten nowhere near doing a full tweak of the PC to kill extra processes and services, but it doesn't feel necessary based on the speed of this laptop.  It has a Windows Experience of 5.8, which is better than I would expect at this price range.  For those so interested, the sub scores are Processor: 6.8, Memory: 7.2, Graphics: 5.8, Gaming Graphics: 6.6, and Primary Hard Disk: 5.9.  In any case it has more than enough horse power to handle most tasks you would expect to perform with a system in this price range.The final item I want to plug is the sound system.  That is not normally something you think of in a laptop, but Acer went to great lengths to give this machine incredible sound.  It has a 4 speaker sound system, and you can watch movies on this device and be very happy about it.  You will most likely not want to have the volume cranked up all the way unless you are hearing impaired!  It is literally the best sound I have ever heard from a laptop.The drawbacks are that this has no optical drive. I had honestly not even noticed that prior to ordering, but then I considered how much I actually used the drive on my last laptop and decided I didn't care.  My main other complaint is this is a bit heavier than I would expect for an ultrathin laptop, but it isn't massively heavier than I would expect.  I attribute this mainly to the reasonably powerful hardware installed.If you are ready to jump into Windows 8, this is the laptop you want.  I don't think you will be disappointed.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really love it", "Author": "Fabio Toffoli Machado", "ReviewID": "R1QTSDLGWBXCCF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Acer Aspire has a very good performance and experience, I would recommend this device.

It's sleek, it's fast, and the speakers give a nice true sound if you want to watch a movie without ear-buds. The graphics are really pristine. You'll have no problem playing the majority of main stream steam games or something like League of Legends.I got this laptop when I started college for a hybrid use of school and entertainment and my friends think it's really sexy. The back-light keyboard makes studying in the dark one less problem, although it only turns on when the power plug is in.As far as battery life, it'll last a solid 4-4.5 hours if i'm just working on a paper or something but really suffers when doing something more such as various activities for entertainment; I'd be lucky if I get 2 hours out of it in that regard yet this isn't really a problem for me since I almost always have access to an outlet.Speed is not a problem at all. It says it's a 2.1 GHz processor, but with it's Turbo CORE Technology, you get up to 3.1 GHz meaning this computer is not slow in any regard. It starts up within no time and opening multiple tabs on your browser doesn't faze the speed.The track pad is oriented toward the left side of the laptop. It's done this way to be centered with the space bar so that when you are typing, your arm doesn't accidentally hit the mouse. The track pad and keyboard are oriented to the left due to the addition of the number pad on the right. I felt a need to talk about this because I've seen some reviews complaining about the track pad being to the left and it's really not a negative. When Acer made this laptop, they knew what they were doing.The color is actually darker than the silver looking picture. Take the picture's color down about 5 notches and that should give you an idea of what it actually looks like. I was not at all disappointed by the actual color, if fact I like it more.Window's 8 is designed for a touch screen so your at the right place if your looking for a good introduction to window's 8. As far as window's 8 itself, I don't use it that much; I just mainly stick to the desktop. But window's 8 is good for surfing news, getting updates on traveling info, or if you are just in the mood to browse a wide range of article topics without having to search them up yourself. It's all there for you on the home screen.I commute to my University so I transport this Laptop about 3-4 times per week. The weight is very reasonable at 4 pounds or so, mainly because it does not have a CD Drive. The only time I needed to download something via CD was Microsoft Office and I just snagged an external CD drive which plugs in just like a usb.Looks like this: http://www.amazon.com/Epartsdom-WP119-Brand-External-USB/dp/9573212919/ref=zg_bs_1292112011_15Now for the drawbacks:If the first few months of use, the track pad began glitching out occasionally and would not respond properly. Kind of like when the surface under a mouse is not adequate and when you try to move the mouse around, it goes really slow and then speeds up randomly; just not accurate. This problem usually went away if I simply put the computer into sleep mode and the reopened it which is done by just closing the lid; it did not require a full restart. This really only occasionally happened in the first 2-3 months but I have not came across this problem for a while now.My second problem (and this is the big one) is the laptop's ability to connect to WiFi on it's own. I saw lots things around the internet saying this COULD be a problem during my researching stage, so it was pretty much a 50-50 shot to have it or not. I sadly fell victim to the infamous WiFi problem. The computer can have a serious disability when it comes to this. Unless I am within 20-30 feet of my home's router, I cannot solidly connect to WiFi; It just fluctuates in and out which is as good as it not working at all. Now I suppressed this problem by using something called a D-Link.Looks like this: http://www.amazon.com/D-Link-Wireless-Network-Adapter-DWA-125/dp/B002KEA8OM/ref=sr_1_3?s=electronics&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1395846729&sr;=1-3&keywords;=D-Link+usbIt basically grabs WiFi floating around and directly plugs into one of the 3 USB hubs on this laptop. I said I SUPPRESSED the problem because even this D-Link does not SOLVE the problem. It gives me solid WiFi up to maybe 50-60 feet from a router, but even the D-Link has it's limits.I personally am 97% of the time within reasonable distance of a router or I have access to an Ethernet cable (this particular model has an Ethernet hub) so this WiFi problem does not effect me very much which is why I gave the it five stars.Every other aspect of this computer is extremely satisfying.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "An overall good laptop with a horrible touchpad", "Author": "Zack Alawi", "ReviewID": "RQC4O0DPKMBWY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Love the speed, power, screen, the sound, the keyboard.  Don't like the placement of the touchpad.  It is set too far to the left and I am right handed so I often activate the Windows 8 side menu.  Don't like the connection juncture between the ac adapter and notebook.  It's kinda thin and feels flimsy so you have slow down and careful thread it in.  I had to return the laptop because the touchpad was driving me crazy.  I tried blowing out and reinstalling the driver but the touchpad just wasn't functioning correctly.  I had zero control of the mouse.  I had to use the touchscreen to navigate and that gets old, fast.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "My wife bought this", "Author": "Rue Koegel", "ReviewID": "R3IQU151OQBL17", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although everything else about this laptop is very impressive, especially the utility of the touch screen, the trackpad is ridiculously poorly designed.The trackpad may work fine for a novice who only requires it's use for basic web browsing and e-mail, but for those of us who would use it often to make on the fly precision mouse movements in order to edit graphics, or play games, the trackpad is useless.It has strong aluminum texturizing to match the rest of the top surface of the laptop; which means it has deep horizontal grooves that allow for easy horizontal movement but dramatically inhibit vertical movement.I found that moving up or down required a much lighter touch than moving right or left because my fingers got caught on the horizontal grooves, causing the mouse to stutter.This inconsistency was infuriating for the few moments I used the trackpad to try and 'two finger scroll' down a webpage. I don't know about my wife, but I'd send the laptop back.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice for the price", "Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "R2QICFFCITAQ58", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Looks professional, sleek and good looking design, build quality feels good despite is being plastic.
