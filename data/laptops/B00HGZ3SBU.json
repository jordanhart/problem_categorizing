This baby runs XBMC like a DEMON...BUT........ I HATE Windows 8!! It's a phone/tablet Operating System on a PC... I've had to run several third party programs to make it look and feel like a PC OS again... With a normal desktop and a start button with programs there...\"Metro\" SUCKS!!! (on a PC)... I can see it's usefulness on a phone or tab but IMNSHO, it's worthless on a PC...The only good thing out of the box on Windows 8 is it's networking capability... Seamless and zero problems with it4 stars for the hardware... one star off because of Win8", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Price wins all.", "Author": "~JoeyThePCguy~", "ReviewID": "R2MK822N4FGDP5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When looking at various models vs price vs specs, for the priceline this is a ->great buy<-. What they do not list is that the CPU actually has a 2.5MB cache size & I do think that is a key selling point 101 for anyone who understands the numbers. Onto the important things.Pros:-Solid Touchscreen windows system under $460-750GB (- updates & programming leaves 600+GB left.)-Quad-Core CPU-Enhanced Graphics Chip (If you upgrade with more memory it only gets better)-Free Windows 8.1 Upgrade/Update, if you choose it. (Not a given with every windows 8 pc being sold right now)-Max battery life 8+ hours with no extra parts added & running in eco/power save mode with low-mid level use.  (If you upgrade memory/parts then you have to account for those pulling away from the normal rated battery life times)Cons:Looking at what you pay for I myself couldn't find any.I paired this with the below items & turned it into a power house for a local awesome teacher. She loves the performance & all the bells/whistles for under $1000, that's truly how you come out a happy shopper is buying what you want & making it your own.  Hope the info helps anyone needing it.  Also the VStart software in many cases helps many people wanting to give their system that same windows 7 look & feel, while still keeping the windows 8 visuals still around.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004MJZ5HS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_3http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AQSTXM/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_1http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BWF5U0M/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_4http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ZEZB88/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004AB70US/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_5", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for everyday tasks", "Author": "harold", "ReviewID": "R3GYU4TX27TSTM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, I was in the market for another Toshiba.
