Not a huge fan of Windows 8, but the build quality and look of the laptop is excellent. Feels solid, a wide variety of inputs/outputs including VGA for those of us who still need it, and HDMI for the future. A solid laptop at a good price. The Intel I3 processor is very solid, and I haven't had any software or hardware issues.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop, Great Price", "Author": "Jade Lo", "ReviewID": "RL4UI5LANBMVE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop not expecting much but it is very solidly constructed, has a plethora of features and is lightweight.
