Not sure why I keep it.  During the warranty period, AND the extended warranty periodit spent probably more time in their hands then mine.  Almost each and every part of this computer broke.  Whenthe power source (that is connected to the MOTHER BOARD) broke for the 3rd time I was actually thankful because itnow classified as a lemon. IT doesn't matter if every part of the internal workings of your computer goes, or it needs sent in 8 times in 18 months it can only be a lemon if one thing breaks 3 times.  Which sucked because I was racking up 2x on a few things...but never a third time. Then the power source finally did a 3rd.  Wow I now classify as a lemon.  Only they beat me on the warranty.  On the outside of your computer, there is a hole that the power source will plug into.  My model of the VAIO had a tiny piece of circular plastic inside that hole. CompUSA tech the very first time it broke (and this was a geek from heaven tech...so nice and wonderful) used a tweezer to help my power cord stay connected and download me all my stuff on it before it went for repair. This never affected the computer or any other repair from hard drives to fans, to key boards to DVD player to Ram and so on.It was an outside part of the computer house.  In fact Sony kept repairing it & I kept going without a computer.  A warranty only last so long. When the external power supply finally racked up a 3rd time they wouldn't honor it, because it required giving me a new computer.  They claimed the broken little ring of plastic was damage to the computer even if it was on the outside of the computer & doesn't have ANYTHING to do with the repair at all. They had been repairing this computer all along for every part over and over again...until they did their best to find any reason possible to NOT honor a warranty. I suppose that I could have gone against Comp USA.  I almost did.  But this was such BULL I wasn't going to involve the tech that had been so decent to me in two years, in a corporate mess that was unfair & wrong on Sony's part.  Your probably thinking I just was abusive to computers.  WRONG.  I've owned them since they weighed a ton, no one visioned a lap top in life and I design graphic frames.  I have my own geek corner.  With 3 systems in a row.  I know how to be with a computer.  In fact I have one that works perfect I bought during this fiasco on my long desk set up a few feet from me.  Don't trust them in customer care.  They will look for every possible loop hole to back out of their warranty if it costs them.  This was beyond ridiculous that I had to buy another system to have a computer that was a lap top since I picked the VAIO.  They are so wrong as a corporation.  I don't want to see anyone, who ever you are get taken the way I did...if your unlucky & get a lemon shipped to you. They exist...lemons.  Which is fine but you don't have to do a person in if they were the unlucky one to have that shipped to their house. Please dear lord...get another brand.  Yes it works great.  I remember that.  But your in a lotto...if you get their lemon on the shelf & god help you then dealing with them", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "POS", "Author": "John Kniley", "ReviewID": "R18ZFG9CAQXWUT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Very, very good computer but Win 8 with a touch screen makes no sense for the productive types. If you are serous about what you do on a computer, don't turn you laptop into a tablet. I called SONY the day I got it to ask of I could downgrade to Win7.

Played around with Windows 8. It's not too bad. Entered the BIOS to check it out. Changed the boot option from UEFI to Legacy Boot just too see if I can boot from the external CD Drive from a disc that doesn't have GPT partition. Reboot and no operating system is found. Not a problem I thought. I'll just go back into the BIOS and change things back. Nope, there's no way to enter the BIOS after that. Tried using a different hard drive, USB drive, different CD-ROM image. Still won't boot and still won't let me enter BIOS. Looked on the web saying to press F2 repeatedly after the VAIO splash screen or to use a USB keyboard. Nothing works.Now, I'm not new to computers having been around them since the mid-80s and having worked on esoteric hardware such as the old 68k Macs, Sun Sparcstation IPC/IPC/UltraSPARC machines, etc.I finally broke down and called tech support (was with them for a good 40 minutes), and she told me to repeatedly press F2 after the VAIO splash screen. Still nothing. Every x86 computer I've owned (excluding Apple Macs) had a little text display in the corner saying what button to press to enter BIOS or at least a boot menu. Even my HP Pavilion dm1 has this. But not this stupid VAIO. The only consolation is that Sony is paying to have the machine shipped to their facility to have it fixed.Absolutely would not buy another VAIO ever again, no matter how good the price is.*EDIT*Thanks to the poster below me for pointing me in the right direction. Ugh. Hours wasted, but at least it works now.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009HPGHWE"}}
