So far, I have found nothing that I do not like about this laptop.I love the dark red color for a change. The keypad is very easy and comfortable to use.The wide screen is nice and the graphics etc. show up so clearly and bright. It is quitea solid and well built computer as far as I can tell. It is lighter than my old Dell whichwill help when traveling through airports, etc. Just an all around good laptop for me andmy uses and for the price I wanted to pay. The price on Amazon was the cheapest I could find.I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!", "Author": "Sam \"Mazz\"", "ReviewID": "R3R8A56QV10DZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned many other laptops but this one is really special.  The price is great, it was delivered to me in a day, and I was online and getting things done in less than half an hour.  Easy to use, great keyboard, and I love the number keypad on the side (no need to purchase anything separate if you use the number keys often).  The screen size is great and the quality of the graphics is exceptional.  I've only owned it a few days but I absolutely love this laptop and would recommend it to anyone!", "Date": "April 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Think twice before buying this or any Samsung Laptop/Notebook", "Author": "Peter Eirin", "ReviewID": "R34Y42A7KTDXAJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this Laptop for my wife 3 months ago. She absolutely loved it until a misterious \"internal crack\" appeared on the screen last week which made it unusable.I opened a repair request with Samsung and sent the unit to the repair location specified by Samsung. I thorughly inspected the unit to see if it had any signs of damage to the case or the screen. Everything looked perfect. No damage of any kind.After 2 days, I received a call from the repair shop telling me about the internal crack. They stated that this happens \"very frequently\" with Samsung Laptops and Notebooks. Even the slightest pressure on the outside cover can damage the screen. All the exercise this laptop gets is when we open and close its lid in order to use it. We don't take it on trips or even move it from its location at my wife's desk. She even kept the plastic protector that came on the outside of the laptop lid so as to avoid any scratches, etc. She could not be more gentle with this unit yet it appears that it will break with the slightest touch.  This is inexcusable for a mobile computing device.Samsung has rejected any responsibility for the poor quality of their product design so now I will have to spend over $300 to repair a $700 3-month old Laptop. This is very dissapointing and, given Samsung's indiference, it will be the last Samsung product I buy.UPDATE - A letter to the office of the president yielded no positive results. Their response: \"it's not our problem\".  I'm going back to SONY products...", "Date": "June 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "so far so good", "Author": "S. Abney \"The world is full of sheeple and I ...", "ReviewID": "RRSTSDKISTGFX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Okay,, the resolution for the laptop screen isn't optimal. 1,366 x 768 isn't that great considering it has a Blu Ray player on board.Here is the thing. For me its perfect because i'm using the laptop to hookup to the 55 in LCD in 1080p. Yes the laptops HDMI and Intel Video will pump out to 1080p.The CPU is great. I have done benchmark tests and they were all good. I ran this laptop through the ringer the first 2 hours I had it. 64bit Windows 7, 4gig of memeory, quad core processing, HDMI out, and Blu Ray player....all for 600 bux and that was with tax.Its doing what I need it too.Installed Boxee,, hooked up my external Raid and boom,,, off to the movies I was and even TV shows. Grabbed the Droid and used it as my remote for the PC... perfect!Take in mind when buying such items. Make sure its going to give you what YOU need. If the 1366x768 isn't going to cut it for you because you are only going to use the Laptops screen. Look else where. That is the only fault that I can see this laptop has, but within the price range I was looking at..... this was the one that fit the bill. The gateways,, well,, I won't do Gateway,, horror story,,,,HP's,,, well same price range but still more expensive by 200 bux to get the same specs I got in this Samsung.Dell,,, well,, I don't do Dell either...horror story.I'd say if you want something with power, and don't care about the on board screens resolution,, its a good price point.", "Date": "July 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Samsung R530 Great for the price", "Author": "H.

Contacted Samsung and so began the real fun. I was told it would have to mailed in to a repair center and all I would need to do was drop it off at and UPS store. I decided to call Samsung and verify how long the process would take. I was told it would take a MONTH!. 5-7 Business days for shipping both ways and 10-14 to repair it. After 2 weeks of not hearing anything from Samsung, I decided to give them a call. I was told it needed to have the mother board replaced (after a total of 20 hours of use) and they are waiting on parts. I then inquired as to how long it would be before I got my laptop back, I was then told it would take 7-14 days from when they received the part to the time it was repaired then another 5-7 for shipping back. Is it just me or is it too much to ask to just mail me a new one! I'm sorry your shoddy quality might bite into your profit margin, but don't sell something you can't support!And I'm sure that my case is a 1 in 1000 occurrence. Many people probably own this laptop w/o any problems. 6-8 weeks (what its looking now) is ridiculous. Oh and the icing on the cake, all the time they have my laptop counts towards my warranty period. So my 1 year warranty is now effectively 10 months.* UPDATE *After 5 weeks at the repair facility i get it back only to HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM! Contact Samsung to have them tell me to send it back for repair again! I then ask how many times this is gonna happen. The response was we don't know. I have a feeling this will keep happening until my warranty is out and it won't be there problem anymore.And funniest thing yet.................Posted this review on Samsung's website and it was denied for \"Failing to meet guidelines\"", "Date": "August 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "I'd buy it all over again", "Author": "Laury", "ReviewID": "R2DIMSHJYWJQKQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I saw this laptop at Best Buy for $849, read favorable reviews on Cnet and really wanted it, but didn't want to spend that much. I thought this one was exactly the same. The touchpad is slightly different... I actually like it better. But there is a Firewire card in the Best Buy one and not in this one. Since I plan to edit video I was slightly disappointed. Other than that I can't detect any differences at all. Since buying this one Best Buy has put theirs on clearance, but it's still more than $100 more than this one.I'm impressed with the speed of this laptop. Everything loads virtually instantly. Video runs smoothly. The display is clear and easy to view in different lighting. It's light and portable. So far the battery has held up... hasn't died on me during any of my excursions, but haven't really challenged it much. Mostly I use it at home, plugged in.I think this laptop was a very good buy for the money.", "Date": "July 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "alot of bang for the buck", "Author": "George", "ReviewID": "R2Y091A6OPG7UQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very well built Samsung Laptop. Lots of bells and whistles for the price. I only purchase Lenovo (IBM) PC's. for the quality, and service.

My previous puchases from other Amazon vendors took very long. The computer is light and beautiful like everything that Samsung makes. It works fine except for the DVD/CD slot that gets stuck and needs to be pressed a few times before it opens. I have not seen that problem before in my several Sony computers.
