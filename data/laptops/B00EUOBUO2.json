This was purchased for me as a gift from my boyfriend, but up until now I have never actually owned a laptop, always towers...so I have no experience in this laptop vs other ones. That being said, this is the best computer I have ever owned. A whole whopping 6 GB of RAM and a 750 GB  HDD. Considering the kind of gaming I do consists of classic games like Oblivion or Mario or other non-PVP gaming, this might be a little overkill but I'm not complaining. Shipping was fast and actually arrived earlier than was expected (arrived on Valentine's Day for me!). I have had little to no trouble navigating Windows 8.1, although I'm still not the biggest fan of it. Overall, if you're thinking about getting this laptop, for less than $600 it is excellent.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "OK But Not Exceptionable", "Author": "mr ambassador", "ReviewID": "R3HNHPKYQPSD7K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not bad unit for price.  A little on heavy side but OK for `7 inch laptop.  Set up a littl cumbersom since little printed info comes with the ui.  All warrany and customer support on-line.  Not keen as to such info could be intercepted by hackers.  This unit is good as a portable workstation.  Screen large and sharp.  Speed of computer not too fast but acceptable.  Hard drive at 750g is good for mps use.  Sound OK but not exceptionable.  Processor is AMD not Intel but difference  is minimal.  Overall not ba fo a workstation  bu do not pay more than  $475 tops.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EUOBUO2"}}
