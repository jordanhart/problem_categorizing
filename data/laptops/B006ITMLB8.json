The hard drive on the first burned and crashed within a week.  I called Amazon and they replaced it immediately.  The one I have now is working well but, it has a tendency to heat up quickly when I am multitasking in Photoshop and other large programs. Don't run without a cooler...it's risky.  I personally think laptop manufacturers need to address this flaw.  This is a fast and otherwise well made computer. except for the overheating issue a great buy.  I am also very satisfied with Amazon's service and help.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "So Far So Good", "Author": "KrisK101", "ReviewID": "R376ZOQ1VDUMEZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since I have gotten it. I haven't had any problems with it. The sound quality is great just as it was advertised to be. I'm still getting to know the laptop so I can't really say much about the features since I haven't used them all. The video quality is great as well I'm watching alot of movies on it ;-)", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent entry level laptop", "Author": "RV", "ReviewID": "R3PDZ0SLFQPX9J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Computer is fairly fast and not too much extra bloatware.Overall construction is middle of the road to inexpensive.  I am comparing this to a work laptop, Dell precision - which is 3x the cost, so some of this is to be expected.The case has a bit of flex to it.  Keys have taken some getting use to, I would suggest reviewing it in person before purchasing.Overall, fits my needs as a low cost family PC.  Low level Office items, e-mail, some kid games,etc...", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Happy with our Acer Laptop", "Author": "Moonglows Mom", "ReviewID": "RCRFKWADFXJ04", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would love to give this machine 41/2 stars because I hate the flat keys. They are the most annoying things that laptop manufacturerers have developed in their quest to make laptops thinner and thinner. Give me a fatter laptop with keys curved to fit your finger tips. Otherwise the machine is fast, good display, can take more memory which I may yet install and is great for what I use it for. I only use it for email, research and the online viewing of an occasional missed tv show so can't speak to gaming or graphics intensive applications.  It almost always connected seamlessly to the wireless network in any motel we stayed in. This is the second Acer laptop we have had, and we were happy with the previous one for several years so we looked to Acer for the new one as well.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Janine Baker", "ReviewID": "R2DOWXHIDRAKDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is an awesome computer.

My first ever Acer laptop and i am impressed, very impressed... ! I bought the intel core i5 and its super fast and was only 500. My Dell Intel core i3 was 550 and it crashed the very month i purchased it. Now I glad i can play pc games on it and intel hd 3000 isnt that bad if your just going to play some decent games. Dont expect it to run all those high requirements game because you will be disappointed sooner or later. But anyways, the bottom line is if your going to buy, choose the intel core i5.

As if you needed a core i5 laptop to check email and surf the web. Wrong. For that even an older Pentium processor will do. In fact that's what netbooks are for. If core i5 is for surfing the web then core i7 (the most powerful on the market) can't be good for much more than medium heavy computer tasks. Let's not mention 4 gb or more of ram.Don't make the mistake and buy this computer just for basic computer tasks. Get a true entry-level laptop for that (around $300) or a tablet, netbook or just use your smartphone.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor keyboard and touchpad layout", "Author": "thinkingotherthings", "ReviewID": "R35R3GENFZBD5K", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I returned this computer the day after I received it.  The keys are a bit high above the actual surface of the keyboard so typing is a bit awkward.  Also, the touchpad is the exact same material as the hand resting area on either side, and it is difficult to move your finger because of the friction.  Minor annoyances, but not the kind I'm prepared to deal with on a daily basis.  But apparently no one else was bothered by this, so maybe it's just me.
