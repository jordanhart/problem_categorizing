Archer \"deb\"", "ReviewID": "R1PS02IPWPVTLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third HP, so obviously, I like the brand. For the money, this is a great computer. I replaced a 17.3\" seven-year-old Toshiba that was still good, but slowly dying, so I wanted something with a similar feel. The keys aren't squishy, so I can touch type easily. The screen is big and bright for my not-so-young eyes. The only sorta negative is the shiny black surface. With two cats, it shows their flying fur - but it doesn't seem to pick up fingerprints, which is a plus. Have had it only a day, but so far no negatives.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good laptop - bad keyboard", "Author": "M. Seif \"M.
