Excellent customer support. This laptop runs great out of the box with only a small about of junk software.  Mainly ASUS applications showing you some of the cool things you can do. Windows 7 so far has impressed me but be aware you will need to do a large amount of updates. (1 gig or better) The HDMI interface works great for connecting your HDTV to play dvd media and web content.  Laptop runs cooler than expected but I still would recommend a good power cooler pad.This model does not have a blu-ray rom, only the K61IC-X1 does.This model you get a faster processor but no blu-ray.Thank you for the person that corrected me on this fact.", "Date": "November 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great middle-ground choice!", "Author": "Michael A. Thornton", "ReviewID": "R2W9SCSMGNRAE0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this out for our son who wanted something for gaming, with a larger screen than my wife's 15\" work laptop but not as bulky as our family 17\". He would have preferred a >$2000 gaming rig but given he's in the military, I didn't want to give anyone else itchy fingers, not to mention being in less than optimal conditions. He was doubtful when he received it but came around quickly once he found that it handled WoW easily. In fact, a friend \"triple boxed\" Wow (running three game concurrently) without any trouble! The keypad layout is much better than the configuration of our 17\" and the boot-up time is short and sweet thanks to ASUS for keeping it clean and virtually free of bloatware (yes, I'm looking at you, HP!) All in all, we're very happy with the capabilities and price of this laptop and will be looking to ASUS for our future needs.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dell XPS Meet Your Match", "Author": "Justin M. Perry", "ReviewID": "R2HD5CTCZIC4DF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought a Dell XPS M1530 November 2008 and it was subsequently stolen November of 2009. In my quest to replace my laptop I was stubborn & hesitant at first to stray from Dell having owned 3 laptops previously from them with no issues and nothing but excellent experience. I went shopping at a local Electronics retailer and stumbled upon this machine which is lesser known in the Southern US, however I have now learned they are the 3rd largest seller of laptop computers in the world and have won numerous awards. This machine is FAST it boots up to start menu in a mere 8 seconds flat which is impressive. Although there are faster machines out there, for the price of this one it is well worth it for under $1000. The screen picture is crisp as no other and is LED HD and has one of the best resolutions out there, great for movies and other video media. The internal sound card combined with alltec lansing speakers provide for an excellent sound also for music, etc. ALthough not as fancy to the eye or as gimicky as a Dell XPS this is as compatible as it gets and at a better price. also interesting is the 1yr warranty that protects you even from accidental dropping of the machine. 2 thumbs up, 5 stars, etc.", "Date": "December 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Do not buy from ASUS, they don't honor their warranty.", "Author": "Bruce G Blumentritt", "ReviewID": "R1I2Z3JS7AWGBE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a notebook from ASUS. The ASUS webpage describes the notebook as having a 2-year parts and labor warranty. The web page of the retailer from whom I bought the notebook describes it as having a 2-year parts and labor warranty. I called the retailer's customer support, and they told me it has a 2-year warranty.I call ASUS for warranty service and they tell me the laptop has a 1-year warranty. A dozen phone calls over 6 weeks plus two escalations and they still refuse to honor their 2-year warranty, in spite of the proof I have given them.Do not buy from ASUS, they don't honor their warranty.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Annoying Screen Flickering Problem", "Author": "DealsGuy", "ReviewID": "R3YHSA090AEEQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "It started out as a great laptop. After few months, I started to notice the screen behaving weird. It will flicker randomly when I resume it from sleep. Then I sent it for fixing to Asus service center. They sent it back without fixing anything saying they cant reproduce the problem without even contacting me. Now I have to figure out a way how to reproduce it for them to fix, which is very hard as the screen flicker on randomly. I did lot of research online too about the problem. Just google 'asus k61ic' and google will pop up with 'asus k61ic screen flickering' as one of the most searched terms. So I guess many people are having problem with this laptop model. I had high hopes on Asus service and expected Asus to know by now about this problem and also have a permanent fix for it. I have RMA'd my laptop 2nd time and sent it. I am waiting to see if they can fix it or not.Lesson Learned: No matter which brand you buy, reliability can vary widely depending on the model of the laptop - now i think, buying good car is lot easier than buying a good laptop.EDIT: ASUS was able to fix the problem and it is working fine after that. I think they replaced my LCD panel. I agree with the other comment - the dvd drive is finicky and springs out at unexpected moments - funny it doesnt get closed so easily too sometimes - its weird.. anyways, apart from that, the splendid utility wont work right, if you login as standard user - it needs administrative rights - another weird thing. Apart from those few annoyances, if you are persistent with ASUS, I guess they will fix your hardware problems. But its not fun to go thru the ordeal.", "Date": "December 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "good laptop", "Author": "ALEXANDER", "ReviewID": "RE809F0EGFJHA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had this laptop for about 2 months now, no tech problems. Had to replace Win7 with Linux, as it gets very slow as you load it with stuff.Pretty decent for common tasks and quite good for gaming, but perhaps not for the latest FPS on max settings. Also works pretty fast with photoshop, although windows does consume a huge amounts of memory.Laptop does stay pretty cool and after 2 months still works very quietly (my last Acer had a scratching and wiggling fan by that time). Battery lasts about an hour and a half on video playback (I guess could be longer if the power saving options are configured properly).The only thing I did not quite like -- the glossy finish of the laptop cover, however, to be fair, it does not show fingerprints as badly and does look pretty cool when clean (for about 15 minutes that is :). Another little annoyance -- plastic around the display is pretty soft and can easily accumulates minor scratches.Another thing I did not expect -- the 16\" display has a 1366x768 resolution, which means that it is more stretched than more \"standard\" 15.4\". Some games playable in full screen on 15.4\" now run in a small square in the center of the screen -- which is not a huge deal especially if you have external display -- but at the same time its great for watching movies.", "Date": "February 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Laptop connected to HDTV with HDMI", "Author": "Janet M. Campbell \"janetinfl\"", "ReviewID": "RG1AFQZSOQRL0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop was easy to setup the display on a 60 inch HDTV with a HDMI cable.  The first time I tried it there was nothing on the laptop screen.  The default settings doesn't allow for anything on the laptop screen.  Everything is on the TV.  So make sure you go to the correct HDMI source to type in your password to get into windows 7.This laptop looks great on a big screen TV with a HDMI conntection.  Now I just need more high definition video online.I also tried the VGA connection.  It also works well, but it doesn't display any high def. video as high definition.It was also easy to setup the display to fill the TV screen with no overscan.My only complaint is the touch pad.  It is hard to get used to.  In the past I have had Lenovo laptops and and loved their touchpads.This is my first Asus laptop and other than the touchpad, everything else works better than I expected.I also like having windows 7 media center to record high definition cable channels.", "Date": "January 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this machine", "Author": "Kevin S.

I've read that ASUS has the lowest return rates of any laptop, and I'm not surprised.  The machine stays very cool and does not seem to overheat.  I've only had this a short time but have been using it heavily, and am very happy with it.I haven't tested the battery all the way through, but I'm guessing from other comments that the battery life is probably indeed inside of 2 hours.  Truthfully, that's not an issue for me.  Maybe it is for others, but I don't fly much and don't have a need to work without a power source for several hours.If you are looking for a strong desktop replacement and want to spend under $900, this is the laptop to get.The keyboard takes a little getting used to, but something tells me it might be sturdier than keyboards on prior laptops I've owned.This is an outstanding machine.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great laptop cursed by one gigantic design defect.", "Author": "PostMeridian \"PostMeridian\"", "ReviewID": "R2FRVO4DMQ0F2T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ASUS K61ICPlus: Fast.
