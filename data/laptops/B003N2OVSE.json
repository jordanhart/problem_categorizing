{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Slimmer Desktop Replacement", "Author": "topslop1", "ReviewID": "RR1HTBKSK5914", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Let me start off by saying that this is a very fast computer.  I7 makes it a blaze and with 4 gigs of ram it holds its on on any advanced program or game.  The videocard in it is more than enough to run Modern Warfare 2 at some high settings and it'll run most things without a hitch.  It is relatively slim as a desktop replacement laptop.  I categorize it as a desktop replacement for a few reasons I'll explain later on.  Now, other things that it does well - size and weight are great for all of the power that you get.  The build is pretty solid, although I could go for a studier base.. it'll give you a little flex if you pick it up from the corner.Now the cons:The battery life is very short, but what can you expect while running a quad core and a dedicated graphics card.Mobility wise you can pack it up and bring it around with you but with very little juice and time on the go you better bring along a power cord.  Also, the size makes it so that it'll fit into a backpack but you are going to feel this thing when you are taking it around with you.  I came from a 13'' macbook pro that I thought was fantastic for mobility and for battery life but it lacked on the speed realm.The screen.. come on, this should be at least a 1680x1080 screen.  There's no reason for it to be 13XX by 7XX.  The screen itself is decent, it's nothing terrible but it is not on par with MBP's screens.The track pad is a little too grippy for my tastes, and you'll have to drag your finger around with some force to get it going.The track pad placement is not the best, as I hit it constantly with the bottom of my palm while I am typing on the keyboard.  It could be / should be placed a little differently... I didn't have much trouble typing with the MPB again but with this I am getting my cursor pushed around and put into the middle of my sentences causing me to go back and fix them.Now for the ugly:This computer Blue screen of deathed on a regular basis and hard locked when doing too much video and audio at the same time.  I looked into this is great detail on Lenovo's forums and I have fixed it somewhat.  I got rid of the original bloatware installation of Windows 7 and found a regular version to install.  After that I updated all of the drivers as best I could, and then I updated the BIOS as well.  I sometimes still get some hard locks, although very rarely now.  Also, I get the \"BIG POINTER\" problem that sometimes shows up for other users of this particular laptop.  So with that said I had some serious functionality problems getting this laptop to run correctly for me.  I had ubuntu on it for a time and it ran without a hitch, but why are we going to be putting ubuntu on a $1000 semi gaming computer?  Doesn't add up for me at least.Would I recommend it?I think its a great computer when it works.  I think if you know what you are getting into you are going to get a deal.  I think that if it worked constantly I wouldn't have a reason not to recommend it.  If I didn't have the functionality issues with it I'd tell people that the screen is a little weak but it's a hell of a deal with all that horsepower in it.  Think of it as a dragster that has weak brakes.. super fast, but not the most functional for day to day driving.I would not recommend it only because I would have gone with a ThinkPad not an \"Ideapad\"  This is obviously a cheaper and less reliable solution to a ThinkPad and it is more geared towards your gamer crowd than your business crowd.  If I could do it again I would go ThinkPad without a second thought.  Who needs I7 in a computer that's only going to run an hour - hour and a half without a power cable?  Get this computer as a desktop replacement that's more affordable and smaller than a $2000 alienware.If you want mobility and more functionality, go with a ThinkPad or equivalent.", "Date": "October 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bad Laptop and Sub-Standard Lenovo Support", "Author": "GN", "ReviewID": "R2QMV1UIA1TZWI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Laptop worked fine for about 11 months.

Being sort of an audiophile and highly critical of most laptop speakers, the JBLs in this model do a fine job and then some. They are relatively loud, very clear, and the intelligent touch-settings allow you to transition smoothly from configuration to configuration for movies, games and music. Additionally, the video output is fairly good which makes this a decent machine overall for entertainment.- The keyboard and touchpad are apt and comfortable. When I was shopping around I found myself in search of something that wasn't going to make me tired of using it after 30 minutes. Trackpads can make me crazy, and this one fit my needs well. Zoom and scrolling work quite well and the keyboard makes it so that you don't have to attack each letter or symbol.- Aesthetic design and portability have been nice. The lid has some neat, platonic graphic work on it and the orange rim around it is a nice touch. It's pretty slim and the edges taper off nicely for comfortable portability.Now for why I am not very happy...It is unfortunate that the above aspects are so nice, because the valuable facets of operation on this machine are lacking.CONS:- We'll start with the biggest physical issue. The screen is floppy. That's right; floppy. When I open the lid it will move back and forth about an inch removed from its true position. It's not entirely unusable as I've found ways to compromise since I am still using it, but it's seriously a nuisance. You will also find yourself mad at how badly this thing smudges. Be prepared to wipe it down with a micro-fiber cloth daily. Over time the lid's contact with the rest of the computer when closed will also incur scratches on the screen and the casing that are irremovable and annoying if you like your computer to look nice. The rubber pads to keep this from happening don't really work and eventually fall out.- Operation is pretty unfortunate. The sound card goes in an out, as if it's picky about what it likes to play. Sometimes I have to close programs that use sound and reopen them for it to recognize the output. Strange, but pretty much a problem since the first month that I've had it. This machine also gets pretty damn hot. Sometimes it's almost unbearable to have it on your lap and I hardly do things to truly stress the system, unless you count iTunes, Office, Skype and a web browser. Don't bother with much gaming as it will lag and struggles often with loading and rendering of graphics. Don't even think about running video editing programs that are heavy on resources like Vegas as your projects will crash. Additionally, be prepared to encounter BSODs. Finally, a huge problem is that startup is SLOOOOWWWW. This can be resolved by removing bloatware, but only to an extent. You should probably configure this thing yourself with a fresh install of Windows if you want optimal startup in addition to fixing a number of other problems.- Battery life is terrible. When I use the computer in classes that are an hour and fifteen minutes, I am prepared for it to be nearly dead by the end. Additionally, the battery will sometimes cut out of recognition and your system will require a restart and battery removal to solve the problem.- I have had other problems with the computer that would require more detailed description, but here's the final staggering gunshot to the foot for this product. I had to order twice before I received a functioning model, and still all of the problems above have existed with this one. The first one that I ordered had a screen problem, something I suspect to be due to a problem with the assembly. If you don't want to deal with some hassle, don't trust this model.OVERALL: This problems with this machine are numerous, and there are some great features, as well. Unfortunately, the bad overwhelms the good and I will never purchase from Lenovo again. It's sad to say, considering the great number of positive things I heard about the company, but this experience has ruined their reputation, for me. Perhaps there are some other very dependable models that they have made, but I wouldn't count on this one ever again.", "Date": "March 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this laptop", "Author": "kamisworld", "ReviewID": "RQ3WXDMI3AH13", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "A simple google search will let you know that there are known common hardware issues with this laptop. Works well until it doesn't. Lenovo customer service is unresponsive and have no qualms about asking you to pay for known hardware issues that are not your fault. Also, they will sit on your laptop without any available information for up to 3 weeks without returning your laptop.Bottom line: you don't want to buy a product that has to go back twice for hardware-related repairs within the first 10 months, especially if they are not use-related.If customer service was more responsive and known hardware issues were fixed as part of a recall, this really would have been a great machine.", "Date": "July 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "T.

The processor is fast, the memory, well I want more memory... Fortunately it's cheap. =)My main problem with it is that the screen is a laptop screen. It's only a 1366 x 768 screen. These days laptops really should be 1080 high. But even with that issue, I would still buy another one of these laptops.**Edit**This laptop is not well put together. Being a computer tech, I noticed that my screen had become loose so I took the keyboard and cover off the laptop in an effort to tighten the screws holding the screen on.When I put the screwdriver to the screw, I immediately noticed that it was tight. Huh? Why is the screen so loose if the screws are tight? Because the mounting brackets had broken off the bottom of the case. There is NO WAY to tighten the screen.This laptop had NEVER been dropped. It is either on my desk or in a protected laptop bag. The simple fact that the brackets broke off the case just from opening and closing the screen drops the rating 2 stars because it shows how cheaply the case was made.@Lenovo, you can do better than this!", "Date": "September 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE", "Author": "LC \"lC\"", "ReviewID": "RE76FYAX45601", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Lenovo i7 core, 8 mb ram.

I love my first lenovo.PROS:Is fast, does all my programs well plus no problem video editing etc. Is light, very Slim, has good sound, mic works great, love the bright LCD lid screen, is quit even when it gets alot to do. The way they build the bottom keeps the lenovo runnung cool even in midday Hawaiian summer. Love the Keyboard, feels very good, fun typing. Also have no problem with the track pad whatsoever.Running it with its blowware, haven't got a chance to redo thinks... so much work... And even with it's bloware it runns fast.CONS:Since is very glossy, collects oily spots easily, had to update Bios and Graphic card so that i would not have a black screen after sleep-mode, comes with a lot of bloat-ware, and the super extra sidebar, well I dont use it because is not very intutiv easy to use, you have to wrap you mind around your finger to get it right. Nice Idea but somehow misses the smoothness. but since no other Laptop has that anyway I just dont miss anything. The webcam could be better kind. not good when light is little dim.

Added to this the frame is not very solid and I had few screws actually break out..Definitely not a good laptop for the price you pay for it..Also customer support is very poor..", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Price / Performance", "Author": "Hayduke", "ReviewID": "R32FOMTZZU5M8M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is an excellent laptop for the price. It has a top-shelf i7 processor and a higher-end discrete graphics card capable of running most modern games at high detail settings.One caveat to mention is that the retail version of this comes with a slower (5400RPM) hard drive and slower (1066MHz) RAM compared to the identical laptop ordered direct from Lenovo. (7200RPM and 1333MHz RAM.) My unit has the faster hard drive and RAM.Regardless, these specifications are simply not to be found anywhere near the price point of this machine. I do some moderately intensive tasks and this thing has handled everything I've thrown at it so far. I've also done some gaming on it and found that it's been outstanding.If you search reviews on the Internet for this machine you will find a number of common gripes. One is the \"huge mouse cursor\" problem. I have experienced this twice. What happens is that your mouse cursor doubles in size for no apparent reason. It's definitely a pain and will go away randomly or with a reboot. (You can also work around the problem by changing the mouse properties to set the cursor to have \"tails\" and then set the tail length to the shortest possible setting. - This causes the cursor to revert to normal size but with a very slight trailing tail effect as you move it across the screen.) Some reviewers have suggested that this is a Lenovo problem specific to this particular laptop. This is untrue. It is a known bug for ATI video cards under Windows 7 and can be found in laptops from various manufacturers. I applied a graphics driver update from Lenovo in September 2010 and so far have not encountered the bug, so it may be resolved as of this date.Another common gripe is that the 1366x768 LCD is sub-par. This is true. However, the statement from another reviewer that the LCD \"should be\" 1080p misses one crucial point. Namely, that this laptop is priced at or slightly under $1k. To hit that low price point, Lenovo obviously chose to make some compromises and one compromise was to go with a 768p display instead of 1080p. In the real world, 768p is fine, particularly when you are talking about a 15 inch display. I've watched a couple of movies on the laptop and the picture is excellent. If you really have your heart set on a 1080p display, then you simply need to be prepared to spend significantly more money than you will spend for this laptop.Bottom line: This is currently (September 2010) clearly the best choice for a budget conscious consumer looking for a laptop that combines portability (it's less than 6 lbs,) gaming power, processing power, and a price at or slightly under $1k.", "Date": "October 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003N2OVSE"}}
