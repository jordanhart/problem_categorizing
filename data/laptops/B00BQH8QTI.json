I'm a fast typer and this computer cannot keep up with my typing speed. The mouse tracker is unstable and unable to understand when I want to move the mouse or moves on its own, which messes up my typing. It constantly cannot connect to my Wi-Fi (maybe because it's very protected, but I've never had a problem with that on any other computers). Forget even trying to load a video on this. The only positive I have about it was when I could get a video to load, the sound was good.

It was $149. When I first opened this lap top, it was not bad for this price( I mean $149 not over $200).  I think this is the cheapest 64bid Windows 8 machine. Intel celeron chip produces a lot of heat, so you do not want to put on your lap directly. I was frustrated with the touch-pad so I used a USB mouse. Because my all PCs are SSD installed, I could not stand this slow speed of this laptop. It took 30 minutes to decide to change a SATA drive to a SSD. First, I unscrewed 4 small screws and unlocked keyboard, then I unscrewed total 14 screws from the panel. There was a yellow sticker on one of the screws. If you removed it, you would loose manufacture warranty. Well, I paid only $149, so even if I broke this, I could sell parts and I would loose probable $30 after all. Who cares? Anyway, I decided to break the seal. After that it was easy. Removed cables and changed to a Kingston 64GB SSD. By the way, I already cloned the hard drive image to the SSD by using Acronis true-image 2013. After I upgraded to SSD, I checked windows experience Index. Primary hard drive index was now 6.8. I did not upgraded a memory because I did not have an extra memory for this. Now may Asus boots much faster than before. I am not sure this would extend the battery life or not. Again, if you want to upgrade, you can do it on your own risk. It is not difficult.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Little Laptop", "Author": "AM/PM For Less", "ReviewID": "R3VCQJGTUK1AGX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very skeptical to buy a mini laptop like this because I was afraid it wasn't going to be powerful.

Did not want to bring my MacBook Pro as I didn't really need it & I needed to keep my carry on bag's weight down (was loaded with camera gear). IPad was not an option as I needed to have something to back up my pictures on. And I wanted a keyboard for email, changing/ making travel reservations during the trip. I did lots of research on this Asus. Reviews seemed pretty good for what it is and what it is intended for. So I ordered this, it came the next day and was satisified right away. It started up quick and connected to my WiFi right away. AC/Batt charger is small & that helps. Screen is a matte screen (what I wanted) and decent. I downloaded Firefox and MalwareBytes right away. Took a little while getting used to the screen size, but got used to it. I did get a small mouse for this and it is much easier to use a mouse than the mousepad. So I highly recommend getting a mouse for this Asus. Unit fit in my Lowe Trekker backpack just fine. On this trip I also took an IPod Touch for WiFi backup. I also got a protective sleeve for this, going for  12 inch sleeve which leaves a little wiggle room. The 10 inch sleeves I looked at were a little tight because of the rear battery bump. Battery life has been good so far and YouTube videos ran OK. I did not do any intensive photo editing work on this, just back up of pix. I had no problem connecting to WiFi in either Australia, New Zealand or Tahiti with this unit. One thing to consider, when going on big trips, make sure you know/have all you passwords and pin numbers with you. This is just in case Google, MSN or Yahoo questions you about logging in from a foreign location & or computer. So I do recommend this as a lightweight basic netbook, perfectly good for email, internet, Facebook and picture back up storage. And so far, no issues depsite lots of bumps and travel. I did try to be gentle with it as it is a plastic case. I have not yet, but probably will get a small/slim DVD player/burner for this", "Date": "July 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Most Powerful Netbook Out There but Plagued by Connection Issues", "Author": "Matthew Garvin", "ReviewID": "R22MDFSBFCXPID", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "UPDATE: After several months of use I am downgrading my review to 2 stars.  I am an advanced user (in IT professionally) and this little powerhouse is plagued by connection issues.  Wifi goes down frequently in many different environments, even while other devices connect without issue.Here is my original review:I am a big believer in Netbooks.  This is the 6th or 7th one I owned.  I started with a Dell Mini 9.  Contrary to popular belief, you *can* get plenty of work done on them, if you clean them up, put in the max RAM allowed, and don't have unrealistic expectations.  It is sad that this market is diminishing, but I am relieved at least -- contrary to what was reported -- netbooks are still being made.Pros for this Netbook:- super small size- ships with 2 gigs of RAM- fast processor- USB 3.0- HDMI out and VGA out- hi res for a small screenCons- ships with Win8- very clunky feel, almost like it is a solid plastic brick- does not feel as snappy as I expectedI have had this netbook for 3 days, ordered from Amazon.  First thing I have done is remove Asus bloatware, installed Windows updates, and installed Classic Shell to get back the start button and flyout navigation like XP had.I will update this review as I get more experience with the netbook.  But out of the gate, it does not feel as snappy as I expected considering the 2 gigs of RAM and processor.  And the chassis really does feel like a solid piece of cheap plastic.  The Acer 270D I bought last year -- although also plastic -- has a much better, metallic feel to it.  I am giving this netbook 3 stars so far, although I am confident I can eliminate unneeded apps and processes and get it up to speed as I have previous netbooks.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "has some serious flaws", "Author": "hurtstotalktoyou", "ReviewID": "RJNVVROH042ZE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Although there are a lot of great things about this netbook, it has some serious flaws.  After a month of pure headaches and hair-pulling, I returned mine.  (Thank goodness for amazon's awesome return policy!)Problem #1:  Horrible touchpad.  As other reviewers have noted, the touchpad is simply atrocious.  It is ridiculously over-sensitive and seriously interferes with typing, to the point of making it almost impossible to get any significant word processing accomplished.  Furthermore, it doesn't have proper buttons, but instead the \"buttons\" are part of the touchpad itself.  The right-click function never even worked on mine (at least, not in Windows).  The basic pointer function is pretty awful too, worse than any of the other notebooks I've owned.  It doesn't have a scroll tab either, and despite hours of technical support I was unable to disable tapping.  Really, this is an over-the-top ridiculous problem.  It would have been better if the unit had no touchpad at all.  I had to use an external mouse anyway, and the pad continually interferes with typing.Problem #2:  Bug makes it impossible to perform factory reset.  On netbooks (and on all PCs) it is common to ship with a factory reset partition instead of recovery CD/DVD media.  With every other PC I've owned, as long as you keep that recovery partition intact then you can perform a factory reset.  Well, not with this netbook!  I never touched the recovery partition, or any of the Windows partitions either.  But the unit ships with a storage-only NTFS partition onto which I installed linux.  I'm not sure exactly what the problem was, but when I attempted to perform a factory reset (because I was trying to fix the touchpad issues, see problem #1 above) I discovered that it was now impossible, despite the fact that both the Windows and the recovery partitions were completely untouched.  When I contacted ASUS tech support, they told me I would have to physically mail in the unit to get it reset.  (Instead I just returned it to amazon for a refund.)Problem #3:  Subpar battery life.  This one I knew before I bought it, but it's still irritating.  It is well-known that the Atom D2700 performs similarly to the Celeron 847, but the former has much better battery life.  This is probably true for other Atom processors like the D2550.  I know that my old Atom N270 system gets better battery life.  Since this netbook doesn't have more than 2GB memory, nor any other worthwhile feature not supported by the Atom line, it doesn't make sense to me to insist on the Celeron.  If I buy another netbook any time soon, I'll try to get an Atom.Problem #4:  Limited linux compatibility.  The hardware does not support the latest ubuntu-variant releases.  Instead I had to downgrade to xubuntu 12.04, and even then the grub2 bootloader never worked correctly.  (This is due to the UEFI alternative to BIOS.)  This problem hit me totally out of left field, since Asus has a history of making linux-friendly products.  In fact, they offer this very netbook to ship with ubuntu instead of windows!  So I was very upset to learn that the windows version doesn't play well with linux, since I do most of my work in linux and only need Windows for specialized tasks.Somebody before me said that \"you get what you pay for.\"  But it doesn't take money to fix these issues.  There are plenty of netbooks out there at the same price point but which have MUCH better design.  Asus has simply dropped the ball here.

I love the form factor of this laptop--my previous Acer 11\" netbook was always just a bit too big. Unlike my first Asus eeePC, I don't sacrifice any resolution on this display. Plus, the matte texture reduces glare and prevents smudging.There are some problems however. The trackpad is *by far* the worst I have ever used. It is incredibly sensitive in some cases and doesn't detect taps in others. I recommend turning off most of the gestures on the included trackpad software. The battery life is great when you're in Metro/Modern, but in Desktop mode it drains pretty fast--I rarely get more than 3:00 out of it even with the display at 25%. And that's a problem, because Window 8 is as pretty as it is useless. I find myself spending absolutely zero time in the Modern environment. Moreover, the power cable slips out of the jack rather haphazardly, which is annoying. Finally, as the other reviews note, this is not upgradeable.The cons are annoying, but given the cost I don't think they detract from this product too much. I've found it much more useable than my previous netbooks. Hopefully it will last as long as my first eeePC, and much longer than my Acer.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Garbage!

If ASUS can help me with that, that will be great.Regards,A new customer!", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little laptop!", "Author": "Heather Smith", "ReviewID": "R2XPXQFSEG8015", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just wanted a small little laptop for using the internet.

For the savings here you got a less comfortable keyboard and a pretty big lump on the back for the battery.

You won't find a better deal on a tiny laptop than this. Just don't be surprised that isn't the svelte thing that you might think it is from the pictures.The one I received had a shiny top instead of the carbon fiber look, and I wasn't pleased with the thickness on the back side so I returned this item.
