{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This laptop with Win7 = WINNER", "Author": "Mickey D", "ReviewID": "RPD8T7W4KXV48", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop for one of our grandson's first semester in college.  The purchase criterion were dependability, value, and ease of use.Lenovo excels at dependability and reliability. The kid has had the laptop for 3 months now and probably has not treated it with kid gloves by any means. What do you expect from somebody who plays hockey?  The laptop has not even hiccuped nor missed a beat.The G570 was a clear choice in value for the capability offered.And finally, ease of use - open the lid, hit the power button . . . the laptop comes alive with the tried and proven Win7 operating system.  Win8 - according to the kid - was just \"too cheesey, I want something simple.\"Will this package result in a better GPA?  Don't have any idea.
