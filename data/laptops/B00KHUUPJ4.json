{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I love having a 15.5\" tablet, and it is pretty light for a laptop but it has some serious flaws too", "Author": "Patrick Visniewski \"Coffee Fan\"", "ReviewID": "R85MT5UCZXMI7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ProsAs a tablet, I love the size of this.15.5\" is great for reading ebooks that consist of more than just text.If you are a college student and have the option of pdf or ebook textbooks, this device makes those books usable. (rather than trying to read with either only 1 page displayed at a time, or with 2 pages shrunk almost to illegibility)As for tablets, it's great to be able to use the full version of chrome or firefox and to get full desktop versions of web sites.Also everything runs faster than on any android tablet I've found.As a laptop this is very light and portable.I think most reviewers that claim that anything larger than 10\" for a tablet \"obviously must be too big\" have never really used their imagination or tried anything bigger. Sadly one of the few 13\" tablets was rated badly by some manly man of a reviewer because the whopping 2.9 pound tablet hurt his lap... um.. so I wonder what laptops this computer veteran must have used in the past...For anyone that wants to read text books, journals, magazines, comics, manga and so on, on an electronic device, then a larger display is must and this device is actually about adequate for displaying 2 full pages, with the text remaining legible and the layout as close to the original layout as possible.The \"metal overhang\" part of the design lets you leave short USB sticks or devices plugged in during transport because it protects them from sticking out. This is only true for those that stick out less than about 1/2\" when plugged in. Like the logitech receivers or the tiny sandisk cruiser usb sticks.Based on what a few people have shown on you-tube, the insides of this device are very well designed and for 15.5\" you have expand the ram up to 16GB and the hard drive is easy to upgrade to an SSD.Cons:Sony provides some of the worst support for reporting software and driver issues I've ever dealt with. Their support scripts end with either \"it is fixed\" or \"send it in for repair\" and so far it seems like nothing else is an optionThe touch input remains active even when the lid is shut, so if you don't have it sleep when the lid is closed, and want to carry it more safely by closing the lid, you will end up with a lot of random touches occurring...This branch of the Vaio family has some sort of interesting metal edges as part of the design. The metal overhangs the sides of the chasis and backs up the display. Unfortunately if you are wearing shorts while using this, the result is occasionally those same metal overhangs will dig in to your legs or stomach or may even end up painfully pinch you. Also in laptop mode one of the metal overhangs completely blocks access to the hardware volume switchThe display lock should be on the sides of the display instead of on the bottom and inside as it is a laptop, the problem is if you forget to lock it before closing it as laptop, when you open it again, it tends to take too much force to open and so it will go from closed to suddenly springing open and then the display itself will somewhat violently flap over between tablet and laptop modeThe hard drive really hurts performance. The flash cache on the drive is no where near enough to make up for the slow mechanical drives included as the only options for the flip 15 and 14. And on the 13 the markup to add an SSD is huge.Windows 8/8.1 IS NOT tablet friendly really. If you can find a metro app to replace the previous version of your preferred windows app, it might support a few extra useful gestures, but it will also be dumbed down providing very few options. And if you have to use a non-metro version of the app, it probably won't provide any real touch support except by accident. If you're clever you can find ways to configure some apps to accept a touch as the most common control. For example with ebooks, assigning a touch to cause it to go to the next page. Win8/8.1 is mostly a step backwards in terms of usability and touch support. One Metro designer claims that Metro is a \"taking a step back to prepare for huge neccessary changes\" but this claim rings false because win8/8.1 has been out for awhile, and yet very little of the \"huge improvements\" have appeared.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "NEW Sony VAIO Flip SVF15N26CXB 15.5\" Touch-Screen Laptop i7 3.0GHz 16GB 1TB+16", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51QvpaJjYHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00KHUUPJ4"}}
