{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great, well-built 2-in-1 that fits my budget", "Author": "slm.raiders", "ReviewID": "R3CR3VWX0ANY8C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Yoga 2 11 since the beginning of March 2014 after researching tablets and 2-in-1's for three months. I was going to get the Asus Transformer T100 but bought the Yoga 2 11 instead and am very happy with my purchase.I already have a powerful home desktop so I was looking for a budget device that would be able to give me the feel of a tablet while powerful enough to allow me to do my work using the MS Office applications. My budget was set to about $500 going into this purchase. While the Asus T100 is a very nice, lightweight, budget friendly model, it felt cheaply made and the storage capacity was quite limiting. For $100 more, the Yoga 2 11 provides 500GB of extra space, a better processor, a better quality build, and a bigger screen. The keyboard on teh Yoga feels more natural and the onscreen keyboard is very responsive. I also like the many ways the Yoga 2 11 can be viewed (tent mode, tablet mode, stand mode, or normal laptop mode). The only caveat is that the Asus comes with the MS Office Home and Student out of the box. Even though I have MS Office 2013 professional at home, I cannot use the same security key for my Yoga. But the alternative open source application called OpenOffice is the equivalent and works great for now. (You can find many more free open source alternatives at [...])My wife also loved my Yoga 2 11 so much that she decided to get her own after feeling very limited with her Kindle Fire HDX 8.9.A few things to note:1. My Yoga did not come with 8.1 one installed out of the box but my wife's did. After updates from Windows Update I was able to install it easily. This does not take away from my satisfaction of the device so no star taken away.2. Best Buy only sells the one in black as noted in previous comments. In order to get the orange model, you have to order through Lenovo's website (unless Amazon or another retailer is carrying it.)3. When I first purchased the Yoga, the touch screen was not as responsive as I would have liked. Calibrate, Calibrate, Calibrate! If you have this issue, go to Control Panel - Hardware and Sound - Tablet PC Settings - \"Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input\"4. The device comes with Lenovo bloatware installed. Some useful, some not. But you can uninstall them at your liking.5. I prefer the start menu rather than the start screen (metro), so I installed the free Classic Start Menu from [...]. It also allows you to customize the start menu.I hope this review helps anyone on the fence or wondering if this 2-in-1 would suit their needs.

It is the silver model shown here. I \"played\" with many different laptops of this size and slightly larger. I was contemplating a macbookpro (very nice but also very expensive), because alot of the laptops I saw had such terrible displays (in my humble opinion) but, this little guy caught my eye...I chose this yoga 2 mostly because the screen is strikingly beautiful and clear (it is an IPS screen) and beautiful from wider angles than any others I saw even some of the more expensive ones ($800ish). It has a snappy speed no matter what I'm doing on it. It plays all of my hd video files even my vob's (thanks to VLC). It has a significantly better build quality and feel than the others I was able to experience hands on. The touchscreen on my yoga2 is very responsive, I did not have to calibrate. My yoga2 came with windows 8.1 very few updates were needed. Boot up and shut down are very fast (close to 10 seconds haha which is good for windows don't ya think =) ) however I did remove bloatware. I have an 2011 HP-DV7 beast with win7 for my heavy work, however this little yoga2 runs extremly well (i'm impressed) even multitasking with internet (I use firefox, never ie) and office running at the same time. Also runs great researching online and watching a movie file at he same time. No lagging on videos (i'm very happy with this too), netflix plays flawlessly (my home has the cheapest fios). The different \"yoga modes\" of using this little guy is very handy and convenient. The trackpad works good but i prefer a mini mouse and use one of those most of the time. The keyboard feels very comfortable and solid. This is a sleek little solid built mini laptop that I just keep wondering if its too good to be true (haha). I'm not a fan of windows 8 but I researched this model and according to my findings if I just can not live with win8 it IS possible to put win7 on this (lenovo site has most of the drivers, rest are available on pc part site)...I'm an advanced pc user and would be willing to downgrade the os if I needed to. Some have stated issues with the \"brightness\" being too dim but I assure that this screen is very bright if you want it to be (change advanced display settings, turn off \"auto dim\" and set \"maximum brightness on dim\" to 100%). All in all I'm very happy with this for internet, office docs, some photo editing, watching hd videos/movies and netflix. it also came with a year of antivirus (bonus, but I usually use comodo anyways)... I'm abit of a gamer (xbox360 and some pc), so i will be testing out some games and then i will update this review. I had some experience with a HP 11.6 ($425.00) that would NOT do any of the above and my 7 year old psp screen was better so I wasn't expecting a lot with this yoga2 but I must say this is an excellent little pc for the price I paid(500). The only boo hoo I have is that it does not have an ethernet port but ethernet \"dongles\" or adapters work very well and remedy this for about 15 buks. I hope this helps others.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Stereo, Keeps Trying to Slit My Wrists", "Author": "ringo", "ReviewID": "R33TYI99EKPEQ7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using a Fujitsu Lifebook since the iPad was just a gleam in Steve Jobs' eyes, so I knew when that died (the Lifebook, not Steve) that I would be looking for another convertible tablet. This one has the same multi-use advantage as my old Fujitsu, and the same slightly smaller pitch keyboard, in a lighter, cooler, and slightly more violent package.Pros:- Nice click-tactile keyboard. Not quite as much key-travel as my old (and THICK) Lifebook, but not the mushy mess of chicklets that some notebooks offer.- The trackpad has buttons. For some reason, hardware vendors think that supporting multi-finger gestures on touchscreens and trackpads means you don't need buttons on the trackpads anymore. I was raised on mice. When I'm selecting or moving things, I want buttons.- Surprising good audio. When I was looking at notebooks in the store, I knew this one had a nice clear display for video. I didn't expect that the audio would be quite so good. The speakers are on the bottom of the machine, which means that in tent mode they are roughly vertical and behind the screen - great for movies. Also great for firing up Amazon Cloud drive (or your favorite online player). The sound is notably better if you give the notebook some acoustic assistance by putting it in a bookshelf or in a similar stable (ideally wooden) box.Cons:- The edges of the notebook, where the black plastic of the case transitions to the silver of the keyboard area, are SHARP.  When I'm typing with my wrists resting on the lower corners of the machine, to either side of the touchpad, I actually wind up with red indentations in my skin. I'm seriously considering duct tape.- Out of the box, the touch screen is actually a little too sensitive. I kept having things read as a double-click when all I wanted to do was a little drag. Some of this can be mitigated by adjusting the settings, and I did a lot of that in the first few weeks of use, and not just to get rid of the goddamn \"Charms\".  (But don't blame Lenovo for Microsoft's mistakes).- Takes a while to come out of hibernate or sleep. The processor for this notebook isn't the fastest, and one of the ways this manifests is when you try to awaken the machine from suspend mode. The screen stays dark for a few moments, and there's the urge to assume the machine is hung and restart. Just wait.- The power button is really easy to accidentally push, inasmuch as it's at the front of the right edge in laptop mode, right where your hand falls when you pick up the machine to move it. Part of this is the constraints of tablet design, but I really wish it had been closer to the hinge. (Or even on the other side, next to the power cord).- Speaking of the power cord, I really wish the connector was angled. I like to type crosslegged, with the notebook on my lap, but with this machine this position puts unreasonable stress on the cord. So, no doing yoga when you are using the Yoga. (I would totally buy an angle adapter if if were available).- The machine is very quiet, but not totally silent, inasmuch as there is a bit of hiss from the internal mechanics.Foibles aside, I think this is an excellent notebook, especially at this price point.  I hope the ergonomic stuff will be fixed in the next iteration.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good combo for travel", "Author": "A Marshall", "ReviewID": "R1MUAYO58XNS5Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently purchased this at Best Buy and so far am very happy -- as it offers a lot for the price range.  My primary need is a machine for work/productivity-- answering emails, word processing, working with spreadsheets, web site maintenance and some light graphics work -- and want two laptops -- so I purchased as the machine I will travel with, carry to meetings, and of course as potential fallback in the event of problems with my primary computer.Features I like:* Very nice screen display -- large enough to get real work done,  good color & graphics for presentations or videos* Enough power to run Windows 8.1, 64 bit* Plenty of hard drive space* LOVE the hinge & different viewing modes.* Screen size:  it's larger than a netbook, but small enough that it is not completely unwieldy when folded into \"tablet\" mode.  It's also large enough to be useful for a table top presentation.Features that could be better:* Touchpad & Touchscreen are not as responsive as I would like. They work -- but sometime require gestures to be repeated.* Keyboard will take some getting used to (larger than a netbook but still smaller than a standard full size keyboard)* Exposed keyboard in tablet or stand mode: I wish the unit came with a light plastic snap on or slide on keyboard cover, to protect the keyboard from dirt or possible damage when not in use.* I'd rather have a somewhat smaller solid state drive - 500 gig is overkill on a machine this size, I would much prefer the same machine with a 120 gig SSD.* Battery life could be better.But given the price - I think this machine is a good buy.  I do find that it runs a little bit slowly -- there is often a noticeable lag when opening programs or apps, for example. I would not recommend this as a primary computer for anyone.  I chose this over an ASUS T100 Transformer -- but it was a close call.  I think that Lenovo Yoga is the best option for someone who wants a laptop that also has tablet-like features, particularly for business or workplace use - not so much for someone who  would be using their unit primarily as a tablet, with a keyboard needed for occasional use.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lenovo Yoga 2 11, great PC, but crappy WIFI card.", "Author": "H. Venegas", "ReviewID": "RCQG5BFZDYMTR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop at Best Buy back in April and can say that there is one glaring problem, the wifi. The pre-installed mini wifi card from Lenovo is by far the slowest piece of junk that I have ever had the displeasure of working with. I recently purchased an Intel AC 7260 mini card to attempt to swap out the old sluggish card. However I discovered Lenovo has rigged this PC to only work with the crappy wifi card they installed otherwise known as \"whitelisting\". From what I have researched online this is basically just a ploy to get more laptop sales or to get you to buy newer, more advanced laptops.There are ways to bypass the problem with the wifi card lockdown but they involve installing modified code into the BIOS which you could potentially brick a computer. I have an ASUS RT AC668U and con only get a top speed of 74 mbps from the current wifi card.Other than my rant above I really like this laptop. It does come pre-installed with bloatware from Lenovo which you can uninstall as needed. The PC is a great entry/budget laptop for users that don't need high bandwidth like gaming or streaming HD movies, but its great for web browsing.I'll update this review if Lenovo ever fixes the problem but doubtful.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best $500 2 in 1 Laptop/Tablet on the Market", "Author": "Travis David", "ReviewID": "R38RPWTR113OPS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: Windows 8.1 64bit; 4 GB Memory; 500 GB Hard Drive; 720p Display; micro HDMI output; solid craftsmanship/feel; 7 hour battery life; HD video camera; extremely convinient display modes (laptop/tablet/tent/stand)Cons: Small keyboard; no Ethernet port; Too heavy to hold like a book for long periods of time; GPU cannot handle modern gamesThis computer has been great for Microsoft Office, Adobe Acrobat, light Photoshop, web surfing, Skyping, and streaming 1080p videos through the HDMI output. Unfortunately the GPU cannot handle modern games such as Skyrim and Assassin's Creed Black Flag.The battery on my laptop broke after the first 3 weeks of use. Luckely it was still under warenty.

So far, this laptop has lived up to my expectations. The screen is better than I expected, very sharp and rich and clear. Performance is excellent, came with Win 8.1, no lags, no delays. Well designed overall. I chose this size because it's bigger than a tablet, smaller than large laptop, and can use it multiple modes: laptop, tablet, touch, etc. Can easily be used in airplanes, on the fly, and always ready since no need to wait for booting, loading, ...BTW, the charger is also smaller than the usual laptop charger... I would want a whole 8 hours without a charger, but this is an acceptable compromiseSome drawbacks are battery life, wish it could last all work day, so I don't have to carry a charger from the hotel to wherever I am.

To me this means I paid top dollar for a refurbished machine.  I will not buy Lenovo again. Amazon will make the company I purchased from take it back.  Or refund the difference between new and refurbished. Was going to go with the new HP version of this.  You have to go to HP to order - couldn't get through Amazon.  That was my deciding factor.
