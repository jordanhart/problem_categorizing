The new one is working perfectly and I loved all the features from before anyways.Pros...Cool aluminum design,excellent specs,15.6\" beautiful 1081p touchscreen,with i5 fourth generation and 8 mb ram it's fast enough for my daily use (I bought mainly to run my biochemistry softwares, write documents and presentations, edit my DSLR photos and stream videos)...has a huge 750 GB memory (yeah I wanted a big hard drive! Not a paltry ssd)...n about 5 hours battery normally with my softwares running (more than enough for me ..I might change the 3 cell battery to 6 cell if it is available though to get more battery backup.. But it's fine for now)Good enough music especially with beats audio on..I got on a huge deal!!Con's....WiFi was a real pain in the laptop they gave me first but after changing it is acting fine now with no drop of signal....It's quite heavy even though it has no optical drive but its fine as I rarely carry it anywhere ( I mostly use my nexus tab everywhere)", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FVRCVKO"}}
