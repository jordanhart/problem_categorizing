Sheffield \"Eener3000\"", "ReviewID": "RCD73AJL67H3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I agree with those who say the keyboard is a little weird at first, but it took me little time to get used to it.  I also agree that you should not buy this machine here since I just picked mine up at Best Buy for $699.99 with the added convenience of being able to take it back to them should anything go wrong (in the first year).As with any computer you ever buy, the first question you ask yourself is, \"What am I going to use it for?\"  I don't plan on doing any heavy lifting with it and the specs are better than either of my desktops which I've used to run Photoshop and AutoCad.  I don't see how anyone can complain about the speed for the price.  I want to do word-processing, surf the Net and watch video.  This laptop handles all of these things nicely.  Why did I pony up an extra $150 for this model over the other Toshiba at the store?  It's small.  Very important to me.After reading a thousand reviews on this thing, I have one last thing to say:  Suggesting to me that I should go get a MacBook instead of a Toshiba is the most useless thing you can put in a review.  I already have a MacBook that I got as a hand-me-down, and it's sitting on the ping pong table in my garage.  I don't like Macs, and there is nothing wrong with me because of it.  It's like saying, \"Oh, that's a nice laptop, but you really should have bought a Chevy.\"  Just tell me about THIS computer, and then go make out with your Mac.", "Date": "February 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "E", "ReviewID": "R2FX9L0J43OI6R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At 1st I wanted to buy a mini because I thought of it being more portable. Then I found out that they are quite slow when you start to add programs like Microsoft office because they are mainly for internet, email, etc. plus they don't come with a CD drive (unless you purchase one separately)But the laptops seemed too big and heavy for me to carry around (student).. After doing tons of research I found this computer. The R705-P35 it's super light, might be as light as a mini. It has tons of memory and it runs many programs at once with no problems. It's quiet, it's thin, and it's pretty small! 13.3in!! So, if you are looking for a mini with the memory of a bigger computer, this is the one for you.Can't say much about battery life because I always have it plugged in, but I will make sure to update if there are any issues.", "Date": "December 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Laptop", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2V0TR6ID8L56T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the laptop I've been waiting for. It's light. It's lighter than my old netbook but includes a real processor (no atom) with a dvd player. Finally I have something I can do real work on that doesn't wrench my shoulder out of its socket. It has great battery life. Recently took two connecting flights down to FL - no battery problems, and it was on pretty much the whole way. Amazing. And the small form factor means I can actually use it on the airplane without any yoga positions. It's plenty fast for what I need it for - light duty programming, office apps, surfing the net, etc. Did I mention its lightness? I'm always handing it to people to amaze them with its miniscule avoirdupois.What I don't like: not a whole lot. Toshiba limits the crapware it installs, but I wish it were easier to get rid of their proprietary \"enhancements\" to the OS. There's one left that I can't figure out how to ditch - the webcam controls that pop out annoyingly from the side if you move the mouse over the edge. Something dumb that I wish I didn't have to pay for but that doesn't hurt anything - Wimax. Useless to me (and most people I suspect). Also - it's fan is sometimes a bit noisy - but only a problem when watching dvd's with the speaker's volume turned down.", "Date": "February 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Couple Complaints on a Solid Computer", "Author": "Techie Eric", "ReviewID": "R1KPLAFSG5CXPK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:-Big hard drive (500gb).  Wont run out of room on this thing.-New intel i3 processor is peppy.  It runs fast and multi-tasks quite well.-Portability (amazingly light)-13 inch screen is just the right size for a decent work space.-No noticeable screen glareCons:-Chiclet style keyboard is not well executed.  The keys are slick to touch and mushy to press. Space Bar is especially bad.  Feels very cheap for a computer of this price.-Touchpad needs to be fine tuned.  Default settings for sensitivity and multi touch features are crummy-Speaking of multi touch... It is EXTREMELY spotty.  I installed Ubuntu Linux alongside the provided Windows 7 and the two finger scrolling worked much smoother-I'm BIG on battery life.  I got this computer especially for it's advertised 8-9 hour battery time.  In reality, however, it gets around 4 1/2. Hardly enough to last me through the day.  (This is on low screen brightness and in the \"eco-mode\" power setting)All in all, this is a good machine.  I would love it if the keyboard wasn't so crappy and it got a little better battery life.  Still, for the money it's tough to beat the specs provided.  If you've got some extra cash I would probably go for the MUCH better constructed Macbook or Macbook Pro.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "More powerful than MacBook Air @ half the price.", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R1UIVR493E0J0J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been looking for a PC equivalent of the MacBook Air since...forever.  But so far, nobody has been able to combine light weight, big screen size, and affordability.

MBA = nada.4) In case you haven't noticed, it's so much more affordable.Con:1) It's not sexy like the MBA.  You're not going to fall in love with it.  Strictly a workhorse.2) Power adapter is still the same brick that Toshiba has been including for the past 10 years.  No innovations there.

So far I haven't seen anything I didn't like, but I am definitely not a computer pro, so for a regular consumer I think it is a great choice.

Screen is great for movies and everyday use.My only complaint is that the space bar needs to be hit towards the middle, not the edges.

It's light, fast, and fairly inexpensive. I erased mine and installed Windows 7 Professional from scratch. Also installed 8GB of RAM. I even used it as a VMware ESXi host temporarily running our Microsoft Exchange server for three days and no one noticed!From the start there were things I did not like but could live with given the excellent weight and 5-hour battery life. The keyboard is not very good, the screen resolution is too low (but bright), and the fan is on the bottom left which is completely obstructed when placed on your lap. Overall the laptop feels cheap.So now I have real problems. One of the two battery latches is gone (though battery is held in place ok with remaining latch). And the Ethernet port has plastic pieces that hold an Ethernet cable in place (with a \"click\"). They have fallen out though no cable was yanked. I'm an IT professional so wired network access is essential as I install equipment, do testing, etc. I called Toshiba about these issues inside the 1-year standard warranty period and was told these problems are not covered since they are \"due to abuse\". I keep my laptop in a padded bag and take good care of it. I'm really disappointed with Toshiba support. I can understand how a cracked case or cracked screen would be from abuse, but parts falling out of the laptop are not.

I looked into the netbooks, which would have fit those criteria, but I was given this laptop instead.  I am so HAPPY with it.  It's much better than a netbook, which would be made cheap to be less than a laptop.I don't get the stated 8 hour battery, even after altering the power settings, but I do get about 6, and so far that's plenty for my long days.

But this time I decided to chance it and go with a nicer model and I couldn't be happier.  I was hesitant to spend so much on a laptop, but Consumer Reports & cnet.com both rank this Toshiba as the best laptop on the market (excluding Macs).  I was a little scared to get a laptop with only a 13.5\" screen, but the resolution is so nice I don't even notice.  What I do notice is that the laptop is very lightweight and portable with a very long battery life, which you never get with a large laptop.  I've only had it for about a month, so I may not have run into some of the problems that can occur over time.  But for now I'm very happy.  If I had to give a ding to this laptop, it's the speakers.  I can't listen to music off of it as loud as I'd like, so I'll probably buy a cheap set of speakers.

Here are my thoughts after using the laptop for a couple of weeks.PROS:* Feels great that I didn't spend a fortune.* Light and sturdy.* Strong performance.* Very nice monitor and graphics.* Stable Internet (doesn't drop my internet connection and it's fast even when I'm 3 rooms away from my crappy wireless router).CONS:* Viewing angle (this probably is a problem with most laptops though).* The speaker(s) are not that great.* Webcam quality is poor.* Touch pad is far from perfect (although the 2-finger scroll does work after some practice).* Battery life is not 8 hours, more closer to 4-6 hours.Overall, the PROS outweigh the CONS for me. I needed a laptop that is light and has solid performance, and this laptop definitely delivered. The battery life is worse than I thought, but still much better than my old laptop. It could be a problem if you travel a lot and need full 8 hours so you can survive through the plane ride.

I wanted something small so I could carry to school. The computer seem pretty fast. I had no issue running multiple applications on it at the same time. It is very light to carry around. The battery life is pretty long. I am not sure it will last 8 hrs but still good battery life.The only issue is the keyboard is not so easy to use. It took me a while to get use to the smaller keyboard and typing at first was hard. After two months I am getting use to it. Overall a good laptop especially if you use to for travel.

I was happy for the first 28 days and then the screen cracked.  I called Toshiba customer support, and the person was polite, but tried to suggest that I was responsible for it cracking.  They tried to pawn it off on my non-existent cat or dog, non-existent kids, and my wife (who exists, but did not touch it).  They then offered to fix it for $450 minimum (I payed $700 for it), but they noted it could take three months. I ordered a replacement screen and repaired it myself (1 mm too thick, which meant I had to crack the casing to have it work) for $240.Although it looks broken (at least nobody wants to steal it) and is kept together by electrical tape and rubber cement, the laptop is reliable and still performs very well more than two years after the trauma.Bottom line is that in my observation of the casing, Toshiba's design for this computer has no protection for the rather delicate screen.

It has been an amazing computer for every minute and has held up wonderfully. I even had it oversees in the middle east for 7 months, where I used it extensively every single day. Even looking at it today after over two years of daily use it looks great! As stated in the description it is super thin, amazingly lightweight, and very fast. People are always surprised at how light and fast it is. I did recently do some upgrades to it. I installed 8gb of RAM and upgraded to the 256gb Samsung SSD (both highly recommended also). Now the computer is even better! There is also a battery upgrade you can get that will let you leave the charger for close to 10hrs, but you can pull a good 5 or 6hrs (maybe more) of use with the standard battery. The one thing I did have to go back to Best Buy for was to get the screen hinges tightened because one came loose. Simple operation you can do in less than an hour with a jeweler's screwdriver.

The Toshiba Portege 705 is wonderful because it is small and easily portable, but also has a CD/DVD drive, making it not only ultraportable but also ultrafunctional for my needs.  At 13.3\", it is small, but definitely easier on the eyes than the 9.1\" Dell Mini.  The full size keyboard is easy to type on, and the i3 processor has been fine as far as speed and functionality.  A 500 gig HD is great for storage of everything I need.  I mostly use this for word processing, email and internet, Powerpoint presentations, and playing Sims.  The only complaint I have is that the touchpad does go haywire sometimes, but this hasn't happened often enough to be a real problem, just a minor inconvenience.  The bottom gets hot when I play Sims, but other than that the airflow is fine.  I would give it 5 stars if the touchpad didn't have occasional issues, but I rate it at 4.5 overall.

The only problem I have had with it was when I was streaming video and using the HDMI out to a TV for about an hour, which caused the computer to start overheating. This isn't uncommon for any computer when you are demanding so much from hardware in a compact area with only a small fan to cool everything. I happen to work for Geek Squad so I had a good amount of research before buying this computer, including advice from an Apple rep trying to get me to buy a MacBookPro. Thanks, but no thanks. I am happy with this computer and I am still in college, while Macs are great, they are also expensive. Yes they happen to be less likely to get a virus or malware, but it is still possible. I have seen this happen. The processor on this computer is great for my needs, and the memory can easily be upgraded to 8GB total at a high speed of RAM for a decent price in case you are running programs like AutoCAD.  I like the fact that there is a eSATA/USB hybrid port so I have options when transfering data. Also, the newer version that is now out has USB 3.0 so you can actually get the speed promised out of your new 3.0 capable external HDD.What I love about this laptop is the weight. When I first bought it I was suprised as to how light it is. I describe it to everyone as how a normal laptop would feel if you took all the guts out. I did find out part of the way that Toshiba got rid of some of the weight. The laptop has very small speakers, but if you are buying a laptop with a screen size of 13.3 you probably are not buying it to watch movies on anyways.This laptop is definitely built for someone who demands performace from their machine, but also ultra portability. The only thing that would make me love my laptop more would be if they had included a backlit keyboard.

At that price ($699) it is hands down the best value for an ultraportable out there. And it has an optical drive - which, if you've ever been in the market for an ultraportable, you know is quite hard to come by and especially in this price range. I was completely astounded to find out that this laptop had one - I was considering buying it because of its small size and weight even before that (really, this thing weighs the same as my 10 inch netbook). If you want anything comparable you are going to have to spend hundreds more.I've had it for three weeks and it's performed well for everything I need it to do - bit of photo editing, skype video, browsing, etc. Runs Windows 7 like a pro. It does heat up on the lefthand side under moderate to heavy use but nothing outside the norm. The fan is noisyish sometimes although I think what people might be noticing more than anything is that it's always on on its lowest setting. In fact the fan was what died in my last portege (I had the tablet a few years back) so I'm crossing my fingers - but I have no indication that there's any problem with it, it just runs at an audible level.The keyboard takes some getting used to and slightly more pressure than others, but seems very sturdy. Battery life is great - I'm getting over 6 hours with the wireless on, browsing, word processing, bit of video so obviously more if you use it more conservatively. All in all, it would be worth putting up with some real faults for the price point, low weight, optical drive, and attractive finish but I really haven't found any.

That said, this is a nice laptop just the way it is for most applications -- 4 gigs of memory, I3 processor, and plenty of storage.  There was not that much Bloatware and after tweaking the OS, and removing all unnecessary programs, this baby flew.  However, I was not satisfied so I upgraded the memory to 8gigs and installed a 120gig OCZ SSD and did some benchmarks -- all I can say is WOW!  $550.00 for the laptop, $180.00 for the SSD, and memory for $95.00 totaling $895.00 for a super fast, portable laptop!  The laptop is built strong and although the keyboard is rather odd for a few minutes, it is solid and starts to feel good.  The battery is fantastic (getting around 6 hours with rather liberal environmental settings), and although the magnesium is a fingerprint magnet, it has a fantastic, professional looking finish.Since I work in the IT field, I have the opportunity to test various laptops such as the new Acer TimelineX series, the Sony VAIO, Panasonic, and HP.  Of all these laptops in regards to portability, features, Quality, and price, the Toshiba wins hands down.  I was in favor of the TimelineX series, but the keyboard is flimsy as well as the LED backlit screen compared to the Toshiba.  The HPs and Sony's are nice, but the cost to quality (in my opinion) is not there.

There are so many things to love about this computer, but the cheap quality of the casing and the terrible keyboard are total deal breakers.First, the case cracked on the sides where the resting pads are so that the computer does not bump together when you close it. Then both pads and the plastic behind them cracked and now there are holes. Then, this caused further cracks down the side of the plastic around the screen. Soon after, the hinge area cracked on the front and back of the screen casing, leading to the hinge cover falling off. Now the bottom left corner is completely separated from the rest of the computer minus the wiring, which is now under stress and threatening to break. I have had this computer just over two years and it has been breaking bit by bit for quite some time now.Also, the many of the keys do not work unless you are VERY intentional with them and the keyboard, in general, is not sensitive to touch at all. This leads to tired hands very quickly.I am far from the only one who has had this experience with a Toshiba Protege and there is a past class action suit against Toshiba for a prior model laptop FOR THE EXACT SAME DEFECT!I am terribly disappointed in Toshiba and their complete lack of accountability.

I do not know whether it is the manufacturer or the retailer who is at fault. There was no instruction sheet or manual of any kind for the computer.

When I tried to install the software using the Software Key,I discovered that the key was for Windows--not Office.  I contacted the retailer who wrote a very nice email saying I should contact Microsoft and he was sure they would take care of it. However, he did not provide me with any contact number for Microsoft. Have you ever tried to contact Microsoft?  I found it impossible to find anyone who could or would help me.  It is impossible to get help from Microsoft unless you want to buy something or have a service contract with them.  So, I ended up having to purchase the software for an additional $135.  I would be very wary of purchasing from this retailer or through Amazon in the future since neither Amazon, nor this retailer who sells through Amazon, really supports the buyer.
