I bought this computer instead of a MBp - and I love it!No issues with WIFI, the Battery is adequate for my usage. Windows 8 isn't as bad as people make it out to be. I'm in the desktop mode 99% of the time. Metro doesn't get in the way at all.Solid Performance so far. I use Photoshop & Illustrator daily. And so far I haven't done anything that presents a challenge to this machine. I would highly recommend this as a workhorse laptop. If you are looking for something to surf the web, write emails & edit word documents - this is not the computer for you - go spend $500 and get you something that matches your needs. If you need a powerful, durable machine then this is a good buy.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply EXCELLENT.", "Author": "Brandon A Frazho", "ReviewID": "R1HYSBKU4TZDFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this computer and have had it in use for a couple months now. I wish the keyboard was a little bigger (or even had the second number pad) and the battery is a bit shorter than I expected it to be, but those are seriously my only real complaints thus far. Beautiful picture and sound, fast, lots of memory, and a solid price for a nice Dell product. I would recommend to a friend looking for something a little nicer for college or beyond. The thing that really got me was a Blu-Ray player too. Nicely done, Dell, nicely done.", "Date": "July 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice looking laptop but has it's issues.", "Author": "codekey", "ReviewID": "RN6YPQAOV9TKQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I don't know if it's Windows 8 or just bad hardware but the numbers sometimes don't register when I press the keys. Unlike my work's Precision M4700 I use with separate mouse buttons, this XPS left/right buttons are part of the mouse pad. When trying to click the button a lot of times the cursor will move off what I'm trying to click. The mouse pad is terrible so I have to use a wireless mouse to make the laptop useable. Also unlike my M4700 the mouse pad and keyboard area on the XPS is an oil magnet. It picks up oils from my fingers/palm very easily. Battery life is blah, it can get me through about 2.5 - 3 hours in class connected to WiFi. Other than that the XPS is very nice and thin. The XPS starts up very quickly. I use Start8 to mimic the Windows start button like on Windows 7 because I didn't like the tiles that Windows 8 uses. I tried to upgrade to Windows 8.1 but ran into an installation issue so I had to revert back to the original installed OS. Hopefully Microsoft or Dell comes up with a fix to be able to upgrade to 8.1 with no issues.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "I had to send it back...", "Author": "Max \"Max\"", "ReviewID": "R15XMDG3RHSBNY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop is sold as a NEW item, but actually was a REFURBISHED one...I brought the computer into France, so that made everything very complicated...I got problems from day 1, and when I tried to get help from The Computer Upgrade King, I had to call at least 10 times before someone gets on the phone. And after very little help from TCUK, nothing had changed.I tried calling Dell... There, they told me I could not be helped either, because the computer was registered under someone else's name (not specified) and I had to fill a form to change it (nothing difficult, but it would take 14 days). And that the computer actually wasn't new, it was a refurbished one. (If I knew that before, I would have never spent $1300 in a refurbished one)At the end, after around 2 weeks, I had to send it back.Bottom line... Don't buy this laptop from them. I ordered the same one from another seller, and I'm happy with it, although the WiFi problem is there!
