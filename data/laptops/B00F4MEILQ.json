I wish I had bought this for myself a few months before.Great features:Still has a DVD burner! Some companies are getting away from them to make smaller, lighter, computers. Like the one my company purchased for me. This one works great!Has all the inputs and outputs! It has VGA port to output to a projector! Those are going away now, being replaced with display ports, to make you buy a new adaptor. This one has it!Basically, this computer has all the standard items you want that new computers are trying to get away from. Plus the new power and operating system.That is the hardware. The software, Windows 8 takes some getting use to. But blame Microsoft for that, not Dell. I don't know what Microsoft was thinking. Just click on the desktop button, and all will be fine. I still don't know why they had to get away from the clock at the bottom right corner, unless you are in the desktop, but whatever.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "O", "Author": "Isabel Freitas Barros", "ReviewID": "R2HQZ8I8MQANR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not like this seler because was not a new computer and I didn't know that.
