I wasn't expecting a super fast laptop but this Laptop can barely load a webpage without locking up or slowing down. I'm a college student currently enrolled in a few computer science courses, and I need a laptop on hand to do my homework. Most of the applications that I have to download in order to do work, take up nearly all of the system resources and it slows the computer down to a snails pace, I can't even open some of the applications that I've downloaded, no matter how many times I re install. My old windows vista computer runs faster than this piece of plastic junk. Also windows 8 just doesn't suit me, it's supposedly supposed to make things streamlined and friendly, but it only slows down the computer and makes the most of the commonly used apps hard to find.To sum it all up, stay away from this laptop if you're looking for something for work or to just watch videos and listen to music. I would suggest getting something from Acer or Toshiba. Much more reliable.

Elmore", "ReviewID": "R353QHK1D7BF20", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a larger windows computer I could upgrade over time, as I' have myself on a pretty strict budget. I have since added a solid state drive and installed Windows 7, put an extra 4GB stick of RAM inside, and upgraded the wifi card. The wifi hasn't worked out yet as this computer comes stock with only one antenna and I will need two to take advantage of the better card (at least I hope that's the way it will work when i get the extra antenna). The RAM has been great, however, but the best upgrade was the SSD and Windows 7. This computer is faster and smoother now, and all the W7 drivers were available and loaded with no problem.Specific to this computer: the keyboard is great for the price -- smooth with the keys spaced well and no flex underneath -- better than some more expensive laptops I've worked with. The CPU is slow for Hulu on HD but works fine a setting don; Netflix as well doesn't work well with HD turned on, but this screen resolution can't take advantage of HD anyway. Older games operate as they're intended at medium settings, but i wouldn't expect much more out of this CPU. APU graphics are fine (between 265 and 512MB with more available) -- that's won't be the bottleneck if you have a slowdown; it'll be the CPU.The beauty of the CPU is battery life. The battery lasts me all day with moderate use; part of that is the low power Sandisk SSD I put in, but the battery was doing just fine even before the SSD. It charges quickly. The original wifi card seemed fine, too; I just have some special range problems I am trying to solve. The computer is light for this size and price range, and it's solidly put together and durable. The model design is in no way ostentatious; that might be good or bad for you, depending on how much attention you like.", "Date": "October 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "hp", "Author": "C.

Windows 8 is actually pretty cool. I expected to be frustrated for awhile, but I'm adapting quite easily.The main reason for the early review is that I did have a software issue and HP's tech support was exceptional. I had to do a complete recovery and that takes time, so I dealt with a few different people and they were all equally well-trained and customer-oriented.I was especially impressed by this because I have had some bad experiences with HP before.UPDATE.4 issues in 30 days, 2 of which were wireless related. I like the machine, if I could only get one that works. HP refuses to acknowledge that this one is defective and has been unwilling to replace it, so far. They'd rather waste tech time (10+ hours and counting), repair time and shipping costs, not to mention goodwill.Windows 8 is ok. There are parts of it I like, parts I don't and parts I have to get used to.Again, this low rating is mostly about HP. The product concept is good.

Imagine my surprise when I booted it up and the screen had the look of my Kindlefire HD (I have 2 of these).  My desktop computers both run Windows 7 and I was definitely not ready to deal with yet another Microsoft \"experiment\" like Vista (oh yes, I got stuck with one of those when I first replaced my beloved XP but converted it to Windows 7 as soon as it was available).  Needless to say I abosolutely did not want nor need another TABLET!  While I am not a novice, it was exceedingly difficult to \"learn\" Windows 8 and then, was encouraged electronically by Microsoft to \"upgrade\" to Windows 8.1 because it would run smoother.......yeah!!  It only took 3 days and a call to India to reach an HP tech who magically got \"inside my computer\" and did some strange things to make it work almost the way it should have done in the beginning.  She got rid of the Internet Explorer 11 that came with the 8.1 and generally straightened it out so that I can at least use it now.  But I am really disappointed in HP and Microsoft for inflicting this on an unsuspecting public.  I can see that Microsoft wants everything now to be an \"ap\" instead of real software because it's cheaper to sell.
