Walker \"Wicked Walker Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R1FHSU45FYDKC2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Something must have been fixed since the previous reviews because I have had zero problems with this computer.  It is amazing.  I love that I can combine the touchscreen (that I am used to with my phone and tablet) into something with a permanent keyboard.  This laptop is SO LIGHT...I think it might be lighter and thinner than my Galaxy Tab 2 tablet!  I do wish Microsoft store had more apps...I am used to Apple and Android having everything...but I assume that will come with time.  There is a slight learning curve with Microsoft 8...but if you are used to a touchscreen it isn't too crazy.  The keyboard keys are somewhat flat but they are plenty big enough to type without problems.  I love the NFC by just putting my Galaxy S4 right on the mouse pad and it connects immediately.  It also has WiFi Direct for those phones/tablets that have that option.  It pretty much has all the options to fit seamlessly into my life and current tech toys.  This is a keeper.", "Date": "August 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A usb3.0 ports is bad \uff01\uff01", "Author": "8000tank_e", "ReviewID": "RUWCZ66TIOQIN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "When I received my pro13, I found that a usb port is bad!

Kumar", "ReviewID": "RTAYBJ1C6UW68", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was originally thinking about a 2 in 1 laptop, but after thinking about it a bit, I realized I wouldn't really use the tablet setting too as the 13 inch computers end up weighing a little too much.  I then came across this model and bout the i7 with 512 gb and 8 gb ram.  It is phenomenal.  I am not a gamer, but do use my computer quite a bit, mainly web browsing, productivity apps, email, etc.  The biggest reason I went with this computer is the weight (it weights less than my 11 inch macbook air!) and lack of any serious problems noted in the reviews (I was considering the equivalent sony 2-1, but there were a number of problems documented with the fan).  I have had the computer for about 3 weeks now and absolutely love it.  I have NOT had an wifi issues, fan issues or any other serious issues documented by other amazon users. The fan does occasionally get loud when I am watching videos AND doing something else, but no louder than my macbook air or previous hp envy.  The temperature also stays relatively cool.  I did buy it direct and went with the refurbished model for significant savings.Pros:WeightSpeedTouch screen is bright and responsiveNice back lit keyboardDid I mention weight?Cons:Sony bloatwareSharp cornersOverall", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful screen and slim design but plagued by problems", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R28W8BDNDH44AW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this laptop for work and initially loved it. It is very light weight and has an extremely slim profile. Additionally the battery life is very impressive and can go nearly all day on battery if the brightness of the screen is turned down. The keyboard feels good and I don't have any difficulty typing on it and it doesn't seem particularly cheap. The 1080p screen also gives a very gorgeous display for a laptop. I loved it for the first month or so I had it.So why the 1 star review? Whether it be Sony or Windows 8/8.1 this laptop is near unusable. Due to either driver issues or OS issues with the model and Windows 8/8.1 if the laptop is not plugged in it will crash either randomly on it's own or when the lid is closed. Occasionally after crashing it will not turn back on unless plugged in. Other times it will shut off once unplugged as if there is no battery in the laptop. I have contacted Sony who replaced the battery which did nothing to alleviate the problem which occurs on both Windows 8 and Windows 8.1. Googling the issue turns up forums of people who claim their specific model was fixed by a graphics update (did not work on mine) or that it is simply and ongoing issue between Microsoft and Sony.Final verdict: Given the price tag of this line of laptops STAY AWAY. For half the price you could get something 100x more reliable.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wifi issues worlwide", "Author": "Ricardo A.

Tried so many things to load them on and just didnt work. I should mention that they all USED TO load just fine.Now to the sony. (Please no childish \"fanboy\" comments) Windows really is the only way to go. If you NEED to do something, i go with windows. (word, powerpoint, audio/video editing, etc.) I should have gone with a windows tablet, try that first, but i went with this.For one, the screen is somehow sticky. NEVER had that problem with IPad. The response to touch was HORRIBLE compared to the iPad. Took forever do basically anything when i used the screen.eventually the whole screen gave way.
