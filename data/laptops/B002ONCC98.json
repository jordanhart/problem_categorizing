The laptop never left my office.  Internal crack on the screen by opening the laptop and the warranty does not cover it? The external speakers never worked well either.  Just awful.

Within a few months the screen frame on hers broke and the battery went bad. I kept mine in one place during that time, but after I started using mine on the battery--for very limited periods--the battery lost all capacity after just a few months. Almost immediately, one of the keys became touchy, not working all the time, and now there are a few keys that don't always work the first time. Both computers will occasionally overheat very quickly and become unusable. My screen is also showing signs of coming loose, and this is a computer that just sits on my desk. Definitely the worst computer I've ever owned.", "Date": "October 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than advertised", "Author": "Jan Gerber \"hal ketchum\"", "ReviewID": "R3VRMBY94GA0W3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After extensive research, I purchased this based on a combination of factors, primarily capabilities, speed, capacity and price.

This had great CPU speed, memory, and options for the price (like HDMI and 4 gb memory).

D. Umstot \"teka3\" (Seattle, WA USA) - See all my reviewsI bought this computer thinking it would offer hi-def capability, but it does not. It does offer an HDMI connection which I have not tried. There is no ability to play blu-ray dvds. Thus, it is just a nice wide-screen for playing non hi-def dvds. The wide screen looks nice, but it is more difficult to web surf because of moving the curser all the way across the screen. A standard size screen laptop would be lighter and easier to use if you are not using it to play dvds.Other issues: 1. Shinny black cover shows fingerprints and looks awful unless you constantly wipe it down. 2. Only 3 USB ports means you need a separate USB dock or are constantly plugging and unplugging. 3. Sound built in is very soft--almost inaudible even at max volume--I had to buy external speakers. 4. Everything except sound plugs in at the side, making it very cluttered. Seems some of the sockets could have been placed in the rear. 5. Power plugs in the right side, an inconvenient location. 6. Stainless steel inside makes it difficult to feel mouse pad--everything feels pretty much the same.HP service is also a problem. It has been outsourced to somewhere in South Asia and the people responding do not seem to understand what they are doing. I tried to get a fix on the low sound problem, but after many emails there was no satisfaction--you have to buy external speakers it seems. I also have a different dvd drive than the one specified. The service people could not answer why or what difference the drivers might make in performance.  It took at least 7 emails to find out that this computer cannot do any form of hi-def.I would not have bought this computer if I had known of these shortcomings.", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Laptop", "Author": "Zhengzheng Chen", "ReviewID": "R12N4FHNK5CQJT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this amazing laptop around one month ago.

Big disappointment!  First, it is overpriced.  Second, the display tends to be on the dark side.  The battery life is a joke--3 hours, max, and that's without watching videos, ripping/burning, gaming, music, etc.  I am not impressed with the speed, either.  My 4.5 year-old HP is just as fast, and gets MUCH better battery life.  In addition, the CD/DVD drive is very flimsy and made of thin plastic.  Looks and feels as if it will break easily.  When I burn a DVD, the drive makes a \"chug-chug-chug\" sound, like a train.  Ripping music from a CD is slow, too, and again, is faster on my old HP.  As another reviewer mentioned, the AC plug is located on the right side of the computer, which is inconvenient; I prefer it on the left, as do a lot of people, apparently.  The headphone and microphone jacks are located on the front of the machine, instead of the side.  Inconvenient, as well.  Windows 7, which comes pre-loaded, is a dreadful OS, IMO, but that's not HP's fault.  Can't wait to get my old HP fixed--yes, I will invest the money!--and start using it again.  I like HP machines and expected to like this computer, but I'm sorry I bought it.  It's not worth the money.", "Date": "December 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop but BLOATED", "Author": "Kevin D.
