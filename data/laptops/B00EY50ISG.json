{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty Neat Little Laptop", "Author": "h1klein", "ReviewID": "RZ7WI4KNZIMN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think most of the reviews below are accurate but I'd like to add some points -1) The keyboard is really very good.  The keys are a nice size given the overall size of this device.2) Make sure and use the Microsoft IE 11 browser in Metro mode when you can.  It's really an incredible browser that allows you to take full advantage of the touch screen.  If you designate any other browser as the default browser, you lose access to the metro version of IE.  My advice - let IE be the default browser.  You can still use other browsers, they just won't be the default.3) Understand that if you run this machine with lots of windows open and programs running, it will slow it down considerably.  You can do it but with only 2gb of ram and the nature of this processor, don't expect it to act like a full fledged laptop.4) The screen bents to the point that the laptop is almost flat.  This is a really nice touch since it makes it easier to use the machine on things like exercise equipment.5) I've found the touchpad to be pretty darn good.  And while you lose some space with the left and right mouse clickers, they two have a nice feel to them.6) The power cord is good and long and there is no \"brick\" in the middle of the cord.  Just a fairly small converter at the point where you plug it in.7) I've been getting good wifi reception.  And since I take it with me to the gym where it can be a challenge sometimes to get good wifi, I have to say I'm impressed.8) If you are going to go with a smaller device that only has a 3 cell battery, you need a processor that is truly an energy miser otherwise you are looking at 2 hours of battery life  The intel processor in this machine is rated at 4.3 watts.  It really helps on battery life.So what isn't good.  Actually there isn't much to complain about.  You do have to get used to the slower processor.  It's speedy by tablet standards but not so much compared to larger laptops.  Netflix and Youtube do just fine.Okay, this review wouldn't be complete without a comment about Windows 8/8.1.  People who don't like it, don't seem to understand it.  That is understandable since Microsoft launched it with virtually no touch screen computers.  Get to know the features behind Windows 8 with or without the touch screen.  There is a lot good here...including the apps that are starting to get developed for the OS.  I have several that I use everyday and really enjoy.Consider loading the free program Classic Shell if you want the full start button effect.  I have done it on every Windows 8 machine I've had  It allows you easy access to your legacy Windows programs as well as your Win8 apps.The overall build on this machine is nice and coupled with Windows 8 makes it a winner.  I've been pleasantly surprised.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Turn for the worst", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2PDCFGVYHCJ0J", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This compact laptop packs one hell of a punch. Though I am still getting used to Windows 8, I use this computer for everything. It is replacing my 15.6 inch Gateway laptop. The touchscreen is a plus. For me 2GB of RAM is sufficient so far, and there is plenty of room for storage on the 320GB hard drive. I must say I am impressed with this laptop so far and would definitely recommend to a friend. I am glad my husband convinced me to jump on the Gateway wagon!!!UPDATE 3 Weeks LaterI was really was really enjoying this laptop until it conked out on me. I went to log on and after I entered my password, the screen would turn blue and stay that way. I tried rebooting it, recharging it, and I even took the battery out, all to no avail. Hence, I returned it today and reduce my rating from five stars to one star. I should have known not to purchase the first release of an item since the manufacturer probably has more kinks to work out. Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little portable laptop", "Author": "Regina Hamilton", "ReviewID": "R1GSYR8YY7SZXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little laptop is a great deal.

The Haswell chip has good battery life (and good Linux support).  It's small and light.I was a little surprised to see no wired Ethernet... but I guess that's like the Mac \"Air\" or a cell phone, so I can get a USB Enet adapter for a few bucks if I need to.  Progress.I like look under the hood, so found out how to get the \"door\" off (I didn't find service manuals on the Gateway site, unlike Dell or Lenovo) : undo the clips at the top of the keyboard and then remove the 5 \"door\" screws.  There is one socket for memory, so it's upgradeable.  There is only one wifi antenna.  The disk is easy to remove at this point.I'm trying to load Linux so I can dual boot it, but I'm struggling with the \"secure boot\".", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great little laptop", "Author": "Barry Hogue", "ReviewID": "R2E3IBWCXYVO7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little machine has worked out quite well for my purposes. My intent was to find a very small, light, inexpensive laptop that I wouldn't be afraid to schlep around, throw into a backpack, motorcycle, etc..  Still needed a functional keyboard and didn't really much care if it had touch screen features or not. Also wanted basic Microsoft Office programs. Have used the Gateway LT41P for about a month now and haven't been disappointed.  Frankly, my first impression was that maybe the LT41P was a not-so-successful attempt to combine laptop and tablet to appeal to the touch screen, social media-oriented market.  However, after using it for a couple of weeks, my assessment changed.  Most of my criticism really is attributable to Windows 8, not this laptop - and with a bit of practice you can get around that.  I'm finding that the LT41P has become my \"go-to\" computer rather than just a backup or travel device.", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "worst LAPTOP in the world!", "Author": "Mindy", "ReviewID": "R2447IHY34P3WC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My screen is giving out everyday, i hear sounds but the picture comes in and out, the touch screen doesnt always touch and when it does it clicks on the wrong things ! i tried calling gateway and i cant reach customer service I HATE THIS LAPTOP i will never purchase something from Gateway AGAIN", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a good choice for me", "Author": "Henry E.

I needed a light laptop to carry around in my backpack.  I have a Lenovo (android) IdeaPad tablet but it limits application I need.This laptop has cheap plastic lid has scratches & is basically ugly .Screen to keyboard controls poorly calibrated, meaning touchscreen functions are too easily set-off, even with adjustment?!.Touchpad insensitive & really doesn't work properly.  No CAPS LOCK indicator lite, so I just waste time when I'm in a hurry.Keeps dropping internet signal when 2nd browser is in use.Performance is biggest letdown.

This little guy is lightweight and I can drop it in my purse and go to the coffee house, the forest, my living room... That said, the first time I booted it up I was overcome with Windows 8 frustration. What the heck? For me Windows products are kind of like taxes, oil changes, sewer cleaning, airport security and grocery check-out lines. Things we endure, because they are a necessary part of our life. Dare I admit that once I got going on Windows 8 I kind of like it? That's high praise from me for a Windows product. Note: there are Windows 8 short-cut keys that make the whole thing manageable, without them you may end up throwing your new computer out the window (so to speak). I found them by downloading a Kindle book, but I bet they are available with an online search.Once I was armed with the short-cut keys then I began to enjoy my new Gateway Laptop. The touch screen is very cool (I thought I would hate it). Though it's not pumped up with power it operated quickly and I have had no complaints so far. I deleted Norton and installed Avast, deleted Windows Office and installed OpenOffice (free!), installed Chrome and I'm ready to go. The Gateway LT41PO4u Laptop is a great lightweight laptop at a reasonable price and Windows 8 doesn't completely suck, I'm actually beginning to like it.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "L. Kelley", "ReviewID": "R1IUL3XT59KLSY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to have an 18 in dell laptop that was big and bulky. It got to be too much to haul around for school. So I did some research and came across this little guy. A lot of people complain about Windows 8 , but i have a Windows cell phone so it doesnt really bother me. I will say, however, that if it wasn't a touchscreen- i would probably be more aggravated with it. I like the concept of Windows 8, personally. It is similar to a tablet in a lot ways, unlike a regular laptop, but its nothing that's too annoying. The fact that it came with Windows office was a huge selling point for me, as i'm currently in school. So far I have no real solid complaints.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far, No GOOD", "Author": "Frank A Manfredonio", "ReviewID": "R1X13680JDGV3Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As the title says, no good.

This review is to provide some additional details:Only buy ram that runs at 1.35v, low density, pc3-12800 204 pin ddr3l.  Anything else, and the laptop will not start up.As a limitation of windows 8 32 bit, only 3.2gb will be available, of which, 256mb will be used by the graphics card, and some more memory used up by the other hardware components, so the final usable ram amount will only be 2.84 gb.The easiest way to insure that you're purchasing the correct ram is just to search for 'lt41p' from the compatibility search tool on the crucial website.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect.", "Author": "Robin", "ReviewID": "R3MOUT4714K2CU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly what I wanted.

Basic surfing in chrome or firefox is rough.  The computer locks up on sites that use any kind programing.  Even a well programed site like facebook will lock up.  So the basic low down is this computer sucks.  You can't watch video even.  Not sure why they put an HDMI port on it I guess that is good if you want a larger screen. The battery life is also short. I had a toshiba netbook before this that was great it had almost similar specs so when I found this one was still being made I excited.  Usually gateway is decent.  I suspect the problem is that specs from 2 years ago just don't cut it anymore as software becomes more advanced. I want to go on about how bad this product is. I wish I just got a tablet and a keyboard.  Now I'm looking into switching to apple.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice!", "Author": "Jill M.
