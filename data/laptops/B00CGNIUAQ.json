The computer is EXCELLENT.  I read a review on Apple's new model SSD hard drive with rater's comments that it is not as repair friendly as this model.  I love this computer and highly recommend it with a 3 year service warranty through BH Photo less expensive than Apple.  Don't buy the 3 pack Anti glare Screen protectors they don't fit this screen.  I do recommend  the hard shell top of the line clear top and bottom case to protect your laptop investment.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wow !", "Author": "A.
