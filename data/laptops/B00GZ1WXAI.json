Philip \"Author of over 100 boo...", "ReviewID": "R3RQDRW2NWLUYG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using Dell machines now for more than 14 years and each one of them has been a pleasure to use. It is the same in the present case also.The machine is sleek, robust and easy to use. Of course, laptops are increasingly coming without DVD drives and this one does not have one. It seems that they have some variations in this model and some of my friends were able to buy them with DVDs. Since this one on Amazon does not have a DVD player, you need to decide whether it would suit your purpose or not.Windows 8 might give some difficulty to new users, but that is more of a learning problem and less of a computer problem. Each version of Windows creates this kind of learning problem, and it is a bit higher with Windows 8 or 8.1 but you will love it once you start using it.The above said, everything else about this Laptop is highly commendable. The price is reasonable, and Dell takes warranties and services very seriously. So far I had to use it only on the laptop that I acquired 13 years ago where they promptly gave me a battery and then a CD drive replacement. I have never had to contact them for any other machine.I recommend this Laptop with the above caveats!", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "fit my budget", "Author": "shawna", "ReviewID": "R1YBYNPM4W69LB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "for the money, I don't think there is a better laptop on the market, for what they charge.

It doesn't have a DVD writer/player, which I was looking for, and ordered this by mistake. However, this was my error. It is quiet, and doesn't seem to get too hot.The biggest drawback to this computer is Windows 8, a real mess of an operating system. My advice: Either bite the bullet and get a Mac, or at least wait till Windows 9 comes out. This computer came with Windows 8, and it took me a couple of tries to get 8.1 loaded on it; at least it was a free upgrade. The Windows updater offered me a couple of \"important updates,\" which I selected, but then one of them failed to install. That never happened on my Vista machine. The \"apps\" for Windows 8 either don't work or are really lame. I tried at least a half dozen clock apps before I found one that worked, and it looked like it was designed by a 14-year-old, really gaudy and cartoonish. It took several tries to find a calendar app that worked. Most of the news apps are pathetic or excessively intrusive, especially CNN, which demands access to your photos and videos (why? to steal them?).After a few weeks, I'm slowly learning to navigate around this dog's breakfast of an OS, but still find it really annoying and a big leap backwards from Windows 7 and even from Vista. Windows Photo Gallery came with Vista, and I was able to download Windows Live Photo Gallery for free. On Windows 8, Microsoft wants me to subscribe and pay a monthly fee just to get Windows Photo Gallery. What a ripoff!Initially I set up screen saver as a slide show of my pictures, and I set them to display in \"classic\" mode. Windows 8 displayed all my photos sideways or upside down. I changed the setting to \"pan and zoom\" and my photos were displayed OK, at first. Now, possibly after a recent update, they are all displayed out of focus.
