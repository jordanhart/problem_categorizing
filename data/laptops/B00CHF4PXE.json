Figueroa", "ReviewID": "R1KJ878UW6NRKL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This budget laptop has some nice features for the money.  It's got a good size hard drive (640GB) and 4GB of RAM, and it's reasonably fast.  It also has a nice bright 15\" screen.  But I just can't get past the horrible sounding speakers.  Now I know the speakers on most laptops are terrible.  But these are by far the worst I've ever heard.  The SRS Premium Sound HD option that comes with this laptop improves the sound SLIGHTLY.  But even when using that option, the speakers still sound very tinny and trebly...to the point where I can't even listen to them anymore.  Because they actually grate on and cause a very unpleasant sensation in my ears.  After just a few days, I had to buy some Logitech multimedia speakers to use as a replacement speaker system for this laptop.  Also, after just a few days, I've noticed that the mouse freezes up sometimes.  I guess it's like anything else...you get what you pay for.  But despite its positive attributes, I can't recommend this product.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CHF4PXE"}}
