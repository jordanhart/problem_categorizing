It has plenty of ram, large enough screen, and more then enough hard drive space. The horsepower is there. The battery life is good, but I have yet to get 8hours out of it. I suspect that's mostly do to my power settings and that I did not charge it up when I first got it.The touch pad on this laptop is offset to the left of center, which is a bit strange and annoying. You will get used to it, but I would suggest you use a laptop mouse. The keyboard has an unneeded num keypad, but many people seem to like it. If that really bothers you to much though then get the 14\". I personally think its annoying as it does not make all the keys on the keyboard where they should be. The enter key, for example, should be the last key on the right.Windows vista is a little sluggish on this laptop, but that's not the laptop as it has plenty of ram and a pretty fast hard drive. I suspect windows 7 will be much faster. The 3 gigs installed is plenty, but why acer did not just install two 2 gig models and bump it up to a full 4 gigs beats me.Another problem with vista is acer only installed the 32bit version not the 64bit. The 64bit version would of been much better. The cpu on this laptop is only solo core, but it does have 64bit instructions.I do notice that this laptop gets dirty easy. I have seen finger prints on the keyboard and some gummy dirty stuff the back of the lcd. I suspect the stuff on the back of the lcd is because its metal not plastic. It could be residual dirt left over from packaging, shipping, etc. Nonetheless, it does get dirty easy. The keyboard gets dirty the most easy of all. Just simple typing, even if your hands are clean, will leave finger prints and marks. Therefore, I would keep a microfiber dust cloth handy for cleaning.Please do remember people, that this  is not the best laptop for gaming. If you want a gaming laptop get an alienware laptop or one of the higher end dells. This laptop is for business use or school use and it performs extremely well in that category.Edit:I figured it was a good laptop which is why I originally gave it shuch a positive review. The reason I thought that is was so good is because at first it gave me no problems, was very light, and the performance was high. After 1 years use though the laptop started to breakdown. Some of the screws on the bottom became lose, screw holes striped out when I tried screwing down the screws as the plastic used to make the case is a very cheap, battery wont accept anymore charges, blue vertical line appeared on the left side of the screen when the laptop actually did boot up, and the laptop eventually just stopped all together .. wont even power up and is completely dead.", "Date": "October 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "Acer Aspire Timeline -", "Author": "Riad A.

Williams", "ReviewID": "R356OXENCSMQ6W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this for $729.00 plus tax, shipping and handling which brought the total to approx $800.00 from HSN with 4GB ram and a 320 GB hard drive(got ripped). Prior to, I knew the possibilities of this new product to the US market (previously released elsewhere)but was not expecting the same old business practice to continue. NO BLUETOOTH built in. Yes there is a button to turn it on but the expectations are for you to accessorize your latest technology laptop with a external device. There is no support or intention to offer this as an internal option from Acer or HSN. Try calling them, hopefully before you buy if this is important to you. Here is a post/response found YEARS AGO from Acer about this issue but different laptop.\"Although there is a button on the notebook for Bluetooth, the Aspire 1640 models that ship in the US and Canada do not ship with a Bluetooth module on the motherboard. Therefore it does not support Bluetooth as it ships. If you push the BT button you should see No Device on the screen. In order to get Bluetooth, you will need to purchase a third party device such as a USB to Bluetooth transceiver, or other external device that provides Bluetooth capabilities. These type of devices are available at most computer shops that sell options and accessories for  notebook products. We do not plan to implement an option to install a Bluetooth module on the motherboard.\"If your looking for a laptop that you can customize to fit your personal needs (personal computer, go figure), this may not be the brand/laptop for you. It is however a step in the right direction towards portable green computing.", "Date": "July 7, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002AURXTY"}}
