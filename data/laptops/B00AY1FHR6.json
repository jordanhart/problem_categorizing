{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Poor quality material for the price", "Author": "Marco F.", "ReviewID": "R2SWR5ILDRC42V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "What seduced me in buying this laptop was its performance, its looks and its ultra-wide screen. As far as performance goes, this laptop is a killer. I added 4GB of RAM which totals 10GB. It's blazing fast. I have no complaints about that. Problem comes to the material used. Looks like VERY cheap plastic. The screen border is awful. The screen itself looks like very cheap plastic - even though it is bright and looks good. Screen has no lock, meaning when you close the laptop, it might come open by itself in the carrying bag - or even when you are carrying it in your hands. The keyboard feeling is AWFUL. Middle part of keyboard will go down with very little pressure. Rubber finishing at the base of the screen is wearing off by 2 weeks of usage - which is ridiculous. The ONLY reason I am not returning it is because I live in Brazil. Otherwise, I wouldn't think twice. For the price, there are way better constructed laptops around. Think TWICE before buying this one. It's a piece of garbage. Won't last long, as it seems.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "If you can find it cheaper, it's definately worth the buy.", "Author": "Kathryn", "ReviewID": "RVAX9J59FKHOM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop on a Black Friday deal for $800, for that price, the i7 doesn't really have an equal. For the full retail price, I may not make the same choice. Just opened it a few hours ago. As a student, I know I'm going to enjoy being able to have a reading on one half of the screen and my note taking software on the other half of the screen. It is WIDE. To get a more realistic idea of how wide, think of the dimensions of a widescreen movie (without the black bars like on a normal monitor). Speakers are great. Battery life is satisfactory for a commuter. After installing all the updates and upgrading (for free) to Windows 8.1, I'm happy with my purchase. I intend on having this laptop for at least 5 years. We shall see.I would have given it 4 stars, but the msrp is too high.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Its not for everyone!!", "Author": "Vijay Chauhan", "ReviewID": "R19ZUNCTIVZEC4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are considering this model, checkout more pictures on other sites.
