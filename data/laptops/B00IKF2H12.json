The difference between a 7200 rpm drive and the one included is slight. I'm talking the difference of a few seconds for most disk intensive things. (Loading and video work)Apart from the slight drawbacks of a slower drive this system screams quality and speed. I primarily use it for video work, and the screen is great as well as the graphics card. My ability to do large jobs is greatly increased because of all the power. While not the top end it works well.I left it to process 25 minutes of HD video. It took just shy of an hour (4x faster than my old computer) and barely got warm.The cooling on this thing is amazing. I can play Saint's Row 3 with ultra high settings in 1080p at about 50 fps and it hardly gets warm. It is also very quiet. I could hear it, but it was noting compared to what my old laptop did when it came to cooling (Asus n55sf, while not bad was not this thing)The sound is a bit strange. The volume is randomly reduced until you open the AudioWizard program and switch modes briefly. Also the built in sub causes the keys to rattle and produces an unwelcome noise. I would deduct a star except that it sounds so good with headphones or speakers attached that it really is not a major issue.Be aware that this thing is big. Most backpacks won't accommodate it at all, and it is very heavy. It's really designed to stay on the desk most of the time.The keyboard is about average. The layout is great, but nothing special. It is one of the more comfortable designs that I have seen and makes good use of the extra space. The backlighting is not super strong but works nicely and is adjustable.One nice surprise is the battery life of the system. In power save mode watching youtube and typing with the screen down low I got almost 5 hours. This is not only better than my old computer, but is actually amazing for a gaming laptop.One little thing is that the keyboard deck is all aluminum. This looks great but makes typing a bit sweaty. Again very small just something to keep in mind.Sorry this is so long.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It does not get much better than this", "Author": "Ammy_Evaluator", "ReviewID": "RVBMSM14UIJMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Updated May 11:I had an opportunity to use this with Corel VideoStudio X7, and it rendered an 18 minute clip into ACV/H264 (1920x1080, 2GB file) in under 20 mins, without breaking a sweat.########The G750JM is the entry level model for the new ROG line from Asus that is based on the latest GTX 800 series of Nvidia GPUs. Going by my experience with the G750JM over the past couple of weeks, I can only imagine what additional firepower its older siblings bring to the party!TL;DR version:##########This laptop is not for everyone. It is meant for gaming enthusiasts (hence the Republic of Gamers branding) and other power users who are willing to sacrifice battery life and portability for this level of power.Its main strengths are in its sturdiness (aluminum casing and rubberized exteriors), its computing horsepower (latest gen CPU and GPU with tons of software utilities), heat dissipation (unique new design based on copper heatsinks and heat pipes), and future proofing (Thunderbolt/HDMI allows up to 4 displays, HDMI supports eye popping 4K resolutions).Its biggest weakness is its audio (even with ROG AudioWizard and the built-in subwoofer.)In the \"what else could you expect in this class\" category: it is heavy (11lbs) and its battery life while respectable, is limited.Finally, in the \"try before you buy\" category: its anti-glare matte display is not for everyone. I personally love it - there are no reflections. At all. However, some users will see patterns (horizontal or vertical lines) that will drive them to distraction.Full Review########This laptop is a gamer's dream - with a latest gen i7-4700HQ processor, 12GB RAM, the Nvidia GTX860M GPU, 1TB drive (Toshiba MQ01ABD100), and a 17.3\" anti glare display. And, if that power weren't enough, you get the ability to overclock the GPU using a simple software tool.Target Demographic===============This laptop is designed for power users (gamers, video editors, animators, engineers, developers, etc.) who need a portable replacement for their desktop. For all other users, this laptop is not only overkill, it may actually be a problem in terms of battery life and luggable weight.Design======With its rubberized black lid, dull matte finish, and black aluminum casing, this is a laptop that looks like its design was inspired by a spy plane. There are lots of small aesthetic touches that make it a pleasure to look at - the glowing power button that would not be out of place on Krypton, the discreet glowing LED on the lid, the brushed aluminum wrist rest, and even its raised rear vents. This is a machine that looks as mean as it performs!Weight======All that aluminum and copper means that this is not going to be the laptop that you'll take on holiday. Even its power brick is massive - possibly large enough to contain a mini nuclear reactor.Display=====Its screen is a joy to use - large, bright, brilliant colors, and no reflections - even in broad daylight. Which means that movies are fun and games are immersive. The matte screen is not for everyone, however, and might be annoying for anyone who actually notices the line-like patterns on the screen.Keyboard=======A backlit keyboard is a mandatory requirement for me, and the G750 even supports 3 levels of brightness. I am a heavy touch typist, and the wrist rest provides solid support and there is no noticeable flex in the keyboard. The keys are comfortable to use and I have not noticed any fatigue over extended sessions.Touchpad=======I'm normally aggravated by most laptop touchpads, but this one is designed very well - the buttons are easy to click, it is very responsive, and all actions are intuitive and happen without any fuss. One tip is to turn off some of the edge gestures that you tend to trip unintentionally. For instance, my typing posture often sets off the swipe from the right edge action that brings up the Win 8.1 charms menu, so I used Asus' Smart Gesture application to turn it off.Heat====I own a Toshiba gaming laptop, and without an active cooling pad, I literally fry my thighs. By contrast, the G750 is much less problematic because it vents its exhaust out the rear and away from you. However, it does get hot, particularly around the left rear vent. In addition, once the fan kicks in, it can be fairly noisy.Performance=========It takes about 30 seconds to boot up - possibly due to its 5400rpm hard drive. Its GPU was able to drive Spec Ops The Line at highest quality with no problems for over 3 hours of gameplay last night. The game is spectacular to begin with, and the atmosphere was replicated perfectly on the G750. Games such as Civ5 and XCom were just as great - though they do not tax the GPU quite as much.Productivity applications and video editors all ran comfortably - making the G750 truly a versatile tool.Battery life:=======I only got about 150 minutes of full screen HD movie streaming out of a single charge - not quite as high as the 3.5 hours mentioned on the product page, but in line with my expectations. (In general, I have found that battery life is about 2/3rds of the marketing promise.)Ports:====You have every conceivable port on here, but the ones that need special mention are the HDMI 1.4 port that supports 4K output, and the Thunderbolt port that is likely to be the interface of the future.Thunderbolt lets you connect external devices directly onto your PCI-Express bus within the computer, and delivers 2 full duplex channels of 10Gbps bandwidth each way! This is twice as fast as USB 3.0. What this means is that as Thunderbolt peripherals begin to appear, you can daisy chain up to 6 devices on to this port, 2 of which can be display monitors. Attach a monitor to your HDMI output as well, and you now have 4 monitors driven by the GTX860M!Note that of the 4 USB 3.0 ports on this laptop, one can be used to charge devices even while the computer is turned off.Audio====This is the weak link of this computer. I was underwhelmed by its performance. A better option is to invest in a good set of headphones (like the Corsair Vengeance 2100).Wireless=======802.11ac. What more needs to be said :)Software:=======There is no bloatware on this computer. When I get a new machine, I normally spend at least an hour getting rid of trialware and spyware. This time, I only had to swap out McAfee and I was done!Instead of traditional bloatware, the ROG G750JM comes with a useful array of tools - including:Asus' GPU Tweak: lets you overclock your GPU by 5%, and to adjust the cooling fan's speed. I intend to avoid overclocking for now until I see how this laptop handles heat.Nvidia's GeForce Experience: this is a useful tool that keeps your drivers updated, optimizes game settings to match your video card's abilities (Nvidia only supports certain games), lets you set a target frame rate so as to boost battery life (handy for less stressful games such as XCom), lets you record gameplay and broacast it (ShadowPlay) and even allows broadcast of games to connected devices (GameStream.) Note that I have not used either ShadowPlay or GameStream and cannot comment on how they work.Nvidia's Optimus: This feature switches off the GTX860M when its power is not needed, and lets the integrated Intel HD Graphics 4600 take over, to conserve battery power.Asus' AudioWizard: Lets you customize audio for the type of game being played.Expandability=========The G750 allows easy access to its RAM sockets and its hard drive bays. Simply pull up on a rubber cover, remove a screw, and you are in.Conclusion#######My previous gaming laptop consisted of a top-of-the-line Toshiba Qosmio which was eminently capable but often felt like a molten brick in my lap, could not run for long when away from a power supply, and had a very unfriendly touchpad.This Asus is the perfect replacement for that machine.To my eyes, its only flaws are an underwhelming audio system and an anemic hard drive - both of which are easily remedied.Happy Gaming!~A_E~", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Incredibly high quality gaming laptop, although heavy", "Author": "Jake", "ReviewID": "RE6KBVXMX469U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ASUS ROG laptops have completely unparalleled build quality in the category. All variants of this laptop including the JS, JH, and JZ run cooler than their directly competing MSI GT series, and have a much sturdier feel to them, although you do pay a premium for it.The aluminum exterior is beautiful and cool to the touch which is something that I find attractive in a laptop that I'm going to have my hands on for hours on end. There is also no extra buttons to accidentally bump on the keyboard. I find it refreshing to be able to use a laptop without annoying multimedia buttons all over to get in your way.It is heavy. Very heavy for a laptop. This is more of a desktop replacement than a laptop that you are going to take to class with you, so the weight is excused. It's also not uncommon in this category of laptops to have to deal with something heavy and bulky.The specifications aren't amazing for the price here, but you're playing for top of the line build quality. You really won't find a gaming laptop this sturdy anywhere else. I'd say it's the best option in the price category.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Look no further", "Author": "pc addict", "ReviewID": "R2GILEL3VCJZPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this laptop for a little less than a week and I'm so glad I decided to pull the trigger on this one.  I've been in the market for a new gaming laptop for the past few months and I was leaning towards purchasing the Alienware 17.  Thankfully, I came across this brand new Asus model and did some side by side comparisons to the Alienware model.Bottom line, the Asus G750JM-DS71 has much better specs than the Alienware and the Asus comes at a better price.  The main differences were that the Asus had 12 GBs of RAM compared to the 8 GBs of RAM from the Alienware.  Asus also came with the brand new GPU from NVIDIA the GeForce GTX 860M where the Alienware came with the NVIDIA GTX 765M. Both GPUs with 2GB. Who doesn't love the latest technology? Both laptops come with the Intel Core I7-4700 processor and similar hard drive sizes. The Asus also comes with the 802.11ac wireless connection (More on this later in the review).  Although the Asus seems to have latest and more supieror hardware, the Alienware 17 costs about $350 more.  Obviously the price will be higher for a well known brand name like Alienware, but to me that extra $350 cost was not justified in this case. There are a few things that I've noticed so far that makes me even more confident that I made the right decision with Asus. The screen on this laptop is just plain outstanding. I'm not used to having matte screens look this good but Asus got it just right. The keyboard feels nice and responsive but I still prefer the feel of a mechanical keyboard for gaming so I have one hooked up to this laptop.One thing I did want to touch upon is the wireless card on this laptop. It comes with the latest 802.11ac and I will say that the wireless connection is unbelievable. Just to give you an idea, my internet connection is meant to be at max stated by Verizon FIOS to be 75mbps download speed and 35mbps upload speed.  My desktop gets about 49mbps download and 35mbps upload on wifi.  When hardwired on an ethernet connection, I would get the same upload while the download would get up to about 78mbps. When I tested this laptop, I got 79mbps download speed and 39mbps upload speed while on wifi.  That wireless speed is ridiculous!  So hats off to Asus for providing such an outstanding wireless card that is equivilent to the speed of a hard wired ethernet connection.As far as temperature, this laptop doesn't get hot at all even after a couple hours of intense gaming.  Gaming was a dream with max settings on Dota 2, I had my frames per second maxed at 60fps and no lag and consistent ping ranging from 50-80 ping. Asus did a great job at releasing the heat towards the back of the laptop so I never feel the laptop get warm at all.  As far as the sound system, its not great but I mainly use my headphones anyway so I'm not too concerned about that.In conclusion, I would recommend this laptop to anyone who would like to get the most value for their money in a laptop. I look forward to spending hours gaming on my new beast of a machine.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "A fast upgradable laptop with nice cooling.", "Author": "Rabid", "ReviewID": "R2HLW0VCS9TJRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a slightly different version of this laptop at Best Buy.  The best buy version has the same CPU and 860M GPU but only had 8 GB of system memory.  I wanted a fast laptop that I could install a SSD drive and extra memory without voiding a warranty.  There is a single screw under a flap on the bottom.  After removing the screw I used an old gift card top pry the panel off.  Once the panel is removed you have easy access to 2 memory slots and 2 drive slots.  There are 2 more memory slots that aren't easy to get to.  On my model they each had have a 4GB stick that I will leave alone.  This means that it is easy to add 16 GB and keep the 8 GB that was installed.  As this model on amazon has 12 GB of ram you may want to read other reviews.  The extra drive mounting bracket was included.An SSD drive is the best upgrade you can make to a laptop.  Any mechanical drive 5400RPM 7200RPM or even 10,000RPM will be slower than an SSD.  I added a Samsung Electronics 840 EVO-Series 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III drive.  Before installing the drive I backed up the system restore partition to a 16GB flash drive using Asus Backtracker.  I have to say that it was incredibly easy to use.  I'm in IT but I think non technical people would find it simple.  Be aware that it doesn't backup your documents it simply puts windows 8 and the Asus bloatware onto the new drive.  I am keeping the flash drive in the laptop box in case I need it later.  This laptop is now incredibly fast!Memory upgraded with 16 GB of Crucial memory, model number CT2K8G3S160BM.  It is important to use memory that is 1.35V.  I have read that 1.5V memory can damage the laptop.  The system now reports 24GB of memory.I have ordered a Case Logic PNC-218 18-Inch Laptop Case but haven't received it yet.  There is a review that states that the laptop will fit.  I will review it once it arrives.The fans will make some noise under heavy load.  But, for most people that will mean they are playing a game so you should have plenty to distract you from the noise.  If the fans kick on because you are using doing graphic and CPU intensive tasks you may want to listen to music.  The fans are powerful and will keep the system cool.This laptop was exactly what I was looking for in a desktop replacement.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buy this one.", "Author": "Jake D.", "ReviewID": "R38NU8JMZVQVK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a very hard person to sell something to because I'm extremely picky.

I absolutely love that laptop for my day to day usage such as surfing the net, checking email and working in Microsoft Word & Excel.  That laptop gave me my first real experience with Windows 8.  Prior to that computer I used an Asus laptop for several years with Windows 7.  I was a huge fan of Window 7 so the switch was a little difficult but it didn't take me too long to get a hang of it.  Although it's still not my favorite, it's not as bad as I thought it was going to be.  It's easy to maneuver around it if you choose to.This Laptop with Windows 8.1:I didn't think it was going to be a big change going from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 but man, I sure notice quite a bit different.  I'd finally gotten used to Windows 8 and all of a sudden I feel like I'm starting from scratch again.  I've been using this laptop for over a month now and I'm still trying to figure it out.  It's not horrible but it just takes some getting used to.Size and Keyboard Layout:I do a ton of typing so the layout and design of the keyboard is a very important factor to me.  This new laptop that I now call my \"Gaming Laptop\" passes the test.  My Dell Laptop that I use for my everyday usage is a 15.6\" touch screen.  I don't notice a big difference in the size of the keys.  The spacing between the keys is a tiny bit wider but not by much.  The slightly wider spacing makes it great for gaming but what's even better, the keys actually light up on this laptop so it makes it nice and easy to see if I decide to use it in the dark.  Although I don't do the majority of my typing on it, I still do some and I find it very comfortable when I do.  It's not compact by any means so there are no wrist issues for me at all.The arrow keys are larger on this laptop which is also a big plus in the gaming world.The number pad is good too.  If there's anything different for me it's that the zero key is the same size as the other numbers.  On my other laptop it's twice the size so this took me a little while to get used to.  Not a real problem though.Other thoughts:Gaming- Although I play games on my other laptop, there are some games that just need more power in order to play them as they're designed to be played.  This ASUS laptop is the top-dog when it comes to gaming. It has an Intel Core i7-4700HQ 2.4 Ghz that is combined with  12 GB DDR3 or memory. The processor is fast and the huge amount of memory gives you the ability to run the most complex game seamlessly without lag. The frame rate is smooth and the picture is amazing. When it comes to gaming this laptop gives the best experience possible.Speed- I think this laptop is very fast. I love how you can boot it up and you're good to go in less than a minute. Loading time on games is very minimal when compared to many other laptops on the market.Exterior options- This laptop has just about every option possible on the sides including 4 USB ports, HDMI, microphone, headphones and a memory card reader among other things.Battery life- This laptop has a 5900 mAh battery pack that is advertised to last 3.5 hours. If you are typing in word or excel or surfing the internet then you will get 2.5 to 3.0 hours on it easily, maybe up to 3.5 hours. However if you are playing games it will depend on the game. Complex games eat the battery up fast. When it's fully charged it will last me 1.5 hours minimum but usually closer to 2 hours in between charges when playing some of my complex games. That is pretty darn good in my opinion.Picture Quality- The picture looks really great on this laptop.  I have absolutely no complaints about the graphic quality on this laptop. It's very high quality 1080p resolution that looks better than any other laptop or desktop computer that I have used.Looks- I really like the look and design of this laptop.  It looks futuristic to me.  Almost like something from outer space.  The top part of the laptop (the back side of the screen and surrounding the screen) has a soft rubber finish to it.  Although it feels nice, I worry that it may get scratched up easier.  The bottom part of the laptop (surrounding the keys) is an aluminum casing that looks.  I have noticed more finger prints than I'd like to see on it though.  It's not bad but they're just a little harder to clean on these kind of surfaces.Space- 500GB is the minimum that I wanted in a gaming laptop so this is a great size for me since its 1TB.  It'll hold way more than I'll probably ever have the chance to use.CD / DVD Drive- A CD Drive is not an option for me, it must have one. This is especially important for a gaming laptop.  There are so many laptops out there nowadays that no longer have this feature. I was very happy to see that this laptop had it. It works great too; in fact it's a bit more difficult to open simply because you have to press in the exact right spot in order for it to open. On one of my previous laptops I was constantly, accidentally opening the CD Drive. This isn't a problem on this laptop. It stays closed.  This is a big plus for me.Solidness- This laptop is a beast when it comes to its weight and solidness.  My other laptop is less than 5 lbs.  This thing is about 10 lbs.  We even joke around it call it our Monster or Beast at times. The weight is justified though because this laptop is loaded with just about every feature that you can imagine including a built-in cooling fan and audio amplifier and subwoofers.Getting started- Right out of the box I found this laptop to be fast and easy to set-up. I had it up and running in probably 5-10 minutes. It's a very simple set-up process.Overall I absolutely love this laptop and I would highly recommend it if a good Gaming Laptop is what you're looking for.  If you're looking for more than just gaming, you can still use it for everyday use for other things but just know that it's definitely heavier and bulkier than your standard laptop.", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love Everything but the display.

I'm a casual gamer and do some multimedia work from time to time, while the GTX 670MX was great, I wanted more GFX power to run games in higher settings. I can play DayZ on high settings with a few tweaks @ 1920x1080 which is amazing for a $1,200 laptop.As far as the CPU it's pretty much neck and neck when compared to the I7-3630QM which was in my other laptop so not much of an upgrade there.I gave this 4 stars because I feel like ASUS could do just a little more and maybe provide soft rubber keyboard keys like the Alienware M14x I had, a recovery disk and a long over due up-gradable GFX option to name a few instead of giving consumers a painful decision to shell out another $1000+ to get the next generation of GFX offerings from them.The outer and interior design has changed somewhat on this laptop when comparing it to my G75VX and I like this design better aesthetically although I have not noticed it running any cooler or hotter with this new copper thermal design after gaming for a few hours.The audio is superb and I have not had any issues mentioned in the other reviews on here. I stream Pandora for hours and it sounds just fine. No rattling or muffling from the speakers. Headphones sounds even better and you have many options to tweak when you use the provided audiowizard software.I do like how the ASUS logo lights up on the front lid of the laptop when it's in use so that's going to catch attention from some people if you're in a coffee shop somewhere. I would like them to illuminate the ASUS logo that's just under the screen too but that's just my personal opinion.I also like how the illumination of the keyboard keys dim when the laptop isn't in use for a few minutes which saves power and it's a nice added feature that wasn't available on the G75VX I had.As for portability this laptop isn't all that heavy and it fits in to a normal back pack just fine. This laptop is a great buy at a great price which was unheard of a few years ago.ASUS has really stepped over the past few years giving consumers more for less and the quality is just outstanding!If you're in the market for a new laptop whether a gamer, business professional or just an average user then you will definitely want to add this G750JM to your arsenal!", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best laptop I have ever had", "Author": "Edward B.", "ReviewID": "R35XJEL3UWYCK1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the nicest laptop I have ever bought.

While this laptop is rather large and heavy the excellent cooling I suspect is going to increase the overall life of this laptop.Pros-Great Gaming performance. Upon getting this laptop in the mail I updated the GFX driver got 3dmark on it and running.  [...].  Pretty solid IMHO.Easy to setup in game configurations with GeForce experience.  It looks at what you have and adjusts the options in game to give you the best performance/quality ratio.  I was quickly able to get Battlefield 4, Final Fantasy XIV, DOTA2, and Titanfall running super smooth at around 50-60FPS.Battery boost seems to have a decent effect when gaming on the battery.  It does cut your FPS down but it does this to extend your overall gaming session.  Depends on the game that is running whether it actually works.  The default Max FPS on battery is 30FPS.  If you never get above 30 on your settings you won't notice much of a difference. But I did notice about an extra hour or so of gaming in my testing with FFXIV.  Overall battery is great. I was able to get 3-4 hours of gaming and 4-5 hours of just web browsing youtube videos etc.Decent sound not the best i've ever heard in my life but one of the best I've heard from a laptop.  Also the mic is pretty good as well.  I've heard no complaints about my sound levels in Ventrillo usingKeyboard is super responsive, keys have a nice bounce and feel to them.  It's also almost a fullsize which makes typing super comfortable.The overall astetic is nice.  I like the stealth fighter look. This is completely subjective though.ConsNo SSD.  This is kind of meh though.  System seems fine the standard HDD installed.  I will be using the 2nd available HDD slot to install a SSD though just to add a bit of extra snappiness.  I really like that I can put in an extra HDD/SSD and there's RAID support across the two drives.McAfee -  There wasn't much bloatware overall but this one piece did upset me just cause it's a pain in the butt to remove from the system.RAM Slots-  This is the biggest con I can see.  This laptop has 4 ram slots only 2 are user accessable with out voiding your warranty.  There are two on the bottom side, only one of which was populated.  After watching some disassembly videos there are two extra ram slots on the keyboard side of the motherboard. There's no way to get to these slots with out completely voiding your warranty.  If you want to populate the one empty slot of memory Google HMT451S6AFR8A-PB.  This is the part number matching the other three that are currently in the system.  Always good to match your memory.  I found one for around 40 on Amazon which gives the system 16GB total.  I don't see me going higher than that due to the aforementioned issue with RAM slots 3/4.Other Thoughts,This thing is great with a few tweaks (extra ram stick, ssd) it is amazing.

The first one was junk, the second one was shiny junk, and this one is great. I'm not a hardcore gamer or anything, but my last laptop was running league of legends on lowest graphics at 26-30fps. I was lagging and skipping bad whilst playing RuneScape on the lowest graphics (that game can run on almost any computer). On this laptop, I can run LoL on highest settings and get 60-70FPS consistently. My last laptop could only get up to 30mbps through my internet connection that I'm paying for 50mbps for, and this one ranges from 55-60mbps. Load times are fast for apps, but only compared to a cheap laptop. It still takes about a minute or two to boot up fresh. The biggest laptop I've owned was 15.6 inches and this one is huge! I didn't expect it to be this big. The resolution looks amazing, but everything is small on it (like on internet explorer and stuff). I know I can set it down, but I'm not going to. The webcam isn't anything special, it's clear. THe microphone seems to work pretty good. The speakers are amazing (to me). My music sounds so good on this. My movies sound better than my tv, an LED vizio smart tv. It would be nice if this had a bluray player, but it's still fine.If you're a super hardcore gamer this probably isn't for you. But if you're a casual gamer and just want a reliable laptop that can do everything at a good speed, this laptop will do you good. It looksreally nice too.Update 6/1/2014: I have ventured into the world of Dark Souls 2 with this computer. I do not know what FPS I am getting as it does not should, but it feels like a solid 60. I will also say that I have been playing on the maximum settings. This laptop really is a monster. I also have not had the fans turn on at all yet. This tells me that the laptop isn't even working hard to run these games. On another side note, I took this to the library with my yesterday without the plug and the battery was doing excellent. In 2 hours I went down to only 91% and I recall it saying I had 6 hours and 15 minutes of life left. This is great! I'm sure this thing will be a powerhouse for years to come", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Gaming Laptop", "Author": "Lillian Erick", "ReviewID": "R37SP9MNODVFZS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I only got this laptop yesterday but I already love it , it's a beast when it comes the performance , I can run War Thunder on High at a steady 60-70 FPS and about 40-50 on ultra .

First off, For gaming no need to be said there. The Graphics of gaming is insanely great. For those who like to watch movies on the internet, this laptop does output 4K resolution once hooked up to 4K HD TV.  I like the option of switching and optimizing graphics when it needs to. The internal wireless AC brought my router speed to the maximum. Windows 8.1 is interesting to use and it does takes time to learn to take advantage of windows 8.1.

First I would like to start by saying that I am a college student, with a background in computer engineering and IT. Before buying this horrible product, I did a TON of research and somehow ended up buying this over MSI's cheap, overheating computers and other unreliable, foreign computers such as Sager.I'm not sure how else to describe this without writing a book, so let me just list the CONS about this thing:1) HDD is loud, clicky and always annoying. They are also 5400rpm which is very slow and it shows greatly. Also, we get 2 500GB HDDs, not 1TB HDD, so if we want to upgrade to an SSD, we drop to only 500GB HDD.2) This processor is literally slower than my last HP computer, which I purchased in 2009. I am not kidding you, it takes me almost 45 seconds once the log in screen hits to open the internet browser. That is sickening, and honestly a major reason in itself to steer away from this piece of crap.3) The keyboard is HORRENDOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The worst thing I have EVER tried to type on. As I write this, I am constantly pressing the backspace button to correct words, because as I type them, the buttons do not react and I end up with words like \"lke\" \"thng\" \"sceen\" etc. It is the worst thing I have ever used in my 15 years of computer use for typing.4) This piece of CRAP blue screens left and right. I called ASUS and they asked me to send in the laptop, and that it would take up to 2 weeks turn-around time. LOL Not only is that the worst customer service I have ever heard, its the worst thing I have ever heard as well. I just paid $1400 to within a week, send it in for repairs?? LOL5) Every 5 times or so of waking the computer from sleep, the keyboard completely does not work. I need to restart the PC in order for the keyboard to work again.6) Sometimes my Razer mouse doesn't work when I plug it into the USB and have to un-plug and re-plug several times for the system to react.Want to know the worst part about all of this? This is the SECOND G750JM that I received, because I returned the first one that was showing the exact same issues. I figured I just got really unlucky and got a bad apple. Well, this second computer did not disappoint and promptly  fell into the same problems and errors as the first, leading me to believe that this line of laptops from ASUS is a complete sham and should be AVOIDED AT ALL COSTS.The ONLY pro to this laptop is that it does cool efficiently. But what good is that when the rest of the computer is falling apart?I swear to you all, PLEASE reconsider after reading this, I promise this computer is bad. VERY bad. I hope to save you from the torment I have gone through. I have now decided to instead build a PC from scratch and ditch the \"gaming from a laptop\" idea.Good luck..", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good performance, lousy keyboard and trackpad", "Author": "Ann Lane", "ReviewID": "R13NSS9E19NPK2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a computer, this laptop provides decent power for the price. But the keyboard and trackpad are not very good at all. The keys aren't responsive. You have to hit the letters very hard. The trackpad is nice and big, but therein lies the problem. It's impossible not to touche it unless your palms are entirely up in mid air. So I am constantly having to deal with inadvertent right-clicking and cursor jumping all over the place. So if you want a laptop, this is not the one to get. If you want a portable computer where you'll use a separate keyboard and mouse, then this is a very good computer.I'm also not a fan of 8.1. But it seems stable and I can navigate okay. I just miss a lot of the shortcuts I'd developed for previous versions of Windows. Maybe I'll learn some new ones. But so far it's been a drag on my productivity.I got this computer to handle large data sets. I must say I'm not a fan of Office 365 either. I was able to dedicate processors in previous versions of Excel. But those same tricks don't work in 365. Dedicating processors is a key element in crunching the numbers. Without it, My old HP with a 1.9Mhz dual processor crunches the numbers faster than this one. That's not the computer's fault, it's Microsoft's and their lack of searchable information on how to configure their applications. But it is relevant in my three star rating.In summary, I'm happy with the computer overall. I like the responsiveness and even the McAffee software is unobtrusive. I feel some of my configuration issues can be overcome with enough searching to see how to accomplish my tasks efficiently. However, the keyboard and trackpad rate as two stars. One star because they work when you operate them the way they need to be operated and another star for the good layout of the extended keys.
