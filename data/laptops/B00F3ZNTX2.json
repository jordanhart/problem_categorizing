{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dell  Inspiron 15R", "Author": "Susie Que \"Deb\"", "ReviewID": "RVPUJW5GVGK4Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Amazon's shipping of this was done quickly. ackaging was too large of a box with not enough protection around it. The design of this computer has a lot to be desired. It is difficult to open. It takes 2 hands to do adjustments to the sound and the speed of a movie where my other one only took one hand to push a button on the front of the computer. I don't like Windows 8 which I upgraded to Windows 8.1. I called for help from Dell and they set my computer to open up on Microsoft instead of just unlocking it. I don't like that. I have my own copy of Office which it won't let me install because it came with a 30 day free trial so it always reverts back to that.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "The SELLER-bestelectronicdeal sold me a PRE_OWNED computer as new", "Author": "BFair", "ReviewID": "R2JR0ODF7V6R35", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The laptop came with windows 8 and won't be able to update to windows 8.1.

Just okay. It is advertised as new but I have reason to believe it may be pre-owned.1. The package had some obvious signs of stickers that were torn off.2. The laptop shipped with the battery attached (Not normal. Manufacturers don't do this.)3. I was unable to browse to Dell's site, despite other computers on my network having no problems. It can browse to all other sites. This is generally a result of someone editing the HOSTS file on the computer for certain domains.I am a computer administrator and all of these things added up is enough to make me more than suspicious. I am returning the machine.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent home computer at reasonable price (on sale)", "Author": "BobWeiss", "ReviewID": "R3GCT2UV8VASM8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great improvement in speed over my prior DELL with Vista. Windows 8 is confusing even though  I have long Windows experience, but after 2-3 days I learned how to find the features I needed.
