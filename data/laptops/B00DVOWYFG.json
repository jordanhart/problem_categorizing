{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HP JT-7000 quad", "Author": "DandyD", "ReviewID": "R27A492CBPLNMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just received this unit from another dealer and it has above avg. fit and finish.  The key board is a bit bouncy under the left had but does not affect typing.  The 1080p screen is very nice and a bit clearer than last years matte model 7212nr.  However it is not an IPS screen but still very nice matte display.  The keypad works well and the wireless intel adapter card works much better than last years railtech adapter in the 7212nr.  I get 5 bars of reception anywhere in my big house.  It boots up fast without an SSD and has a quite fan, again much quieter than last years model 7212nr.  I'm not a gamer so don't know how good the card works with games.  I thought it was only going to have the one Nvidia card but noticed it does have the intel 4600 card also.  Can't figure out how to turn the brightness down on the Nvidia card when I disable the intel card though.  Appears the brightness controls just work with the intel card.  The blu-ray works great with no jitter or problems on first play.  The only major disappointment is the internal speakers are not as good as last years model such as the 7212nr.  They have little bass and just don't sound great but are just avg. speakers. I don't plan to listen to them that much so it was not a deal killer for me.  However, I'm taking off one star for the just avg. speakers.  Can't see much improvement in battery life, likely a little better than last years, about 4 hrs chg. on normal use.  This is no Mac Pro as far as fit and finish, but then again, it's almost a grand cheaper, so good value for what you get.7/29/13  Now having major issue with intermittent freeze ups from a bad touchpad or the intel 2230 card is dropping out, don't know which, it is very frustrating.  I may have to return if I can't get this freeze up resolved.  It still freezes with an ethernet connection so it appears it is an equipment compatibility problem with windows 8.  Just don't know and the HP tech did not know either.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "SIN QUA NON", "Author": "LOGAN McGINNESS", "ReviewID": "RU3U1AIOGHFAX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "IT REPLACES AN OLDER HP.

After it actually began smoking and then powered off (and has not powered on again), it took 5 HP support staff and 3 days of conversations before they agreed that it was even broken.  It has now been over 3 weeks when they told me they would have my laptop back to me in 5 business days, and now they are saying it will be at least 4 more weeks until they can return the laptop.  Dell and newegg have very good return policies and support services go to [...] or [...] if you are looking for a laptop.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DVOWYFG"}}
