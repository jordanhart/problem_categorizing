It's good on battery life with the extended battery turn on option located on the screen if your battery starts getting low. The clarity of the screen is good for viewing the sites and it's lightweight construction makes carrying easy. I'm well pleased with my purchase and the delivery time was quick.

The probs I did have were more with getting used to Windows 8 than with the laptop itself. The laptop is great - I found the numbers keypad on it to be a great help to me, and surprisingly, it's lighter than than my older one. This is definitely worth it.", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop for the money", "Author": "ksmccurry", "ReviewID": "RX7831OBTII0K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought it specifically to do taxes on.Everything works as advertised.WIN 8 is really different, but learning it as I go.", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "I Love It so much......

Christmas Time 2013NO REAL ISSUES NO REAL COMPLAINTS.GREAT PRODUCT SO FAR FOR ME.One exception it is a little slower and that's because its a duel processor and the new ones have the core i3, 5 ,7  processors which are super fast. but you'll be paying $1200 for a descent one of those.lucky me I pick up this model for only $250Basically so far so good. Thx ASUS", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "works great but has some issues", "Author": "af12", "ReviewID": "R9WNEPJPKERCU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "the good: Its light enough to carry around. I love the smart gestures especially since I don't use a mouse, so I can scroll and zoom in and out really easily. The touch pad is sensitive so all you need are light taps. The sound quality is pretty decent but there is a problem, written below. It has plenty of hard drive space and is fast enough for me. Screen size is great. It has a memory card reader. It has a usb charger, so I can charge anything even when its turned off.the bad: I like to have it plugged in without the battery most of the time (I'd like the battery to last me a while) but the power cord falls out easily when i pick it up sometimes, it doesn't happen very often but it has happened a few times. It would have been better without the numpad, the keyboard spacing is fine but I like the arrow keys separate so that they're easier to find especially in the dark, plus the keyboard wouldn't look so squashed. The criss cross pattern on the lid leaves fingerprint marks all over as soon as you touch it and also makes it hard to clean off. As I've mentioned above, I really love the smart gestures but some days it just won't run unless I restart. The speakers are at the bottom of the laptop, so if you put it on anything other than a table the sound gets muffled. I agree with reviewers that some parts do look cheaply made, the optical drive is very flimsy and loose when ejected out, if you take out your battery you can see right through to the bottom through some holes on the keyboard. Barely a few days into light use(maybe 4-5 hours a day) the fan started running fairly hard, now that everything is sorted and I use it regularly, the fan runs almost immediately as soon as I turn it on. I can only find where the hot air gets pushed out, but not where it goes in. I used to have a dell laptop where you could clearly see a fan where the air gets sucked in and a vent where it gets pushed out, which meant if the fan started complaining I knew it was time to clean out all the lint it had sucked in. With this new laptop I have no clue if placing it on carpet or on my lap is a problem or whether it ever needs to be cleaned. It only has 2 usb ports, it hasn't been a problem for me yet, but one day if I do decide to use a mouse again I'll only have 1 port left. The microphone and webcam is awful, only 0.3 megapixels, when I used skype I had to either talk louder or try to talk directly at the microphone for the other person to hear anything clearly. If you have anything plugged into the usb charger and you put it into sleep or hibernation mode, it stops charging for a while which isn't so great if the device has battery memory.Overall I'm really happy with what I got compared to my old laptop and with the price I paid. This laptop met all of my needs and I have to say I like using windows 8, it really isn't as bad as everyone says, although the charms could be less sensitive when I move my mouse.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "POS", "Author": "noel w sutton", "ReviewID": "R3AVFAAJC1UC5H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It will not boot!

The reviews were good, so I bought it. My first impression was how cheap the material look and feel, not like my Dell and the HP. Other problem was that is a finger print magnet, always looks dirty. But what make me change it was the poor almost inaudible sound of the speakers, I need to use headphones to hear. Didn't like neither that the hard disk is in two partitions. It runs well the programs and the screen looks good, is windows 8 fault the software problems, but I expected more for an almost $400.00 computer and that brand. Finally, I found a Dell for $40.00 more, change it and now I'm happy.
