Is a little heavy than I though. This computer is a gift (Wife) so I haven't got the time to actually tested very good so the rate can change at any moment. I got a code for Windows, is a 25$ for their apps store. The AMD Radeon HD 8400 graphics is plenty for her.Pros:Windows load fast. We have to considered that is a new Windows with not that many programs installed. Further testing is needed.The touch screen is great for windows 8, I think that is a must have for Windows 8.Is a complete  keyboard (number pad) and it feels OK.Everything is working at is should be. No issues with the product.Camera is good. It works really well with Skype.the material of the laptop does not feel cheap so that is good for me.It have a good processor for everyday routine (office programs, web, skype).6GB of ram, that is plenty of memory.Cons:A little loud on the fan side. I haven't play with the settings on the HP coolsenseA little heavy. This is a  present for my wife.Possible updates that would increase performance:-I think that with an SSD drive this computer should be great.Overall:Is an excellent everyday computer programs, web, skype and so on (so far, I need to do more testing that is why I only gave it 4 stars). I don't spec for this computer to run the latest game because is not for that, but actually I think it can run them but in low.Update on the review coming soon.Update1: I had said that the code that I got was for Windows 8.1 but is just a $25 giftcard from Windows. Doing some updates now to the computer, it keeps responding very good.Update 2: Installed windows 8.1, nice upgrade and all the normal apps. This computer have the availability to go from tablet to PC and PC to tablet. Again the touch screen on windows 8 for me is a must have. Windows 8 learning curve is not too hard. It would let you run two application on one screen, for example, need to write a paper of a video or book, you can have the video or book open on one side of the screen and word open in the other side. You can also determinate the size of each side, so the important program can be bigger.Computer keeps running great, I haven't install any games but again is not for me and is not for that either.Fan noise when down.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "My gift to myself", "Author": "SMF", "ReviewID": "RF56JMAW0Z256", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great laptop- I am going from a PC with Windows XP so I am fumbling my way around but I like it.

Carreon \"Audio Visualization\"", "ReviewID": "R38Q49K7NHND2A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mom who isn't very good with PCs. I figured a quad core would be a good standard to begin with. It comes with all the normal connections one needs for today's use. I found the touch screen itself very useful to move around the PC while setting it up. 15.6\" screen size is perfect for a laptop, any larger and the PC becomes less portable. It turns out she loves it because she doesn't need to use a mouse. The 4gig memory is a bit of a let down but I plan to upgrade it i the near future to 8gig. I have family members were impressed with the specs and price of this PC. HP doesn't sell physical backup DVDs for this PC. However, you are able to create a backup at home. you have a choice between DVD, DVD DL, or USB. It stated I would require at least 24G of space so a 32G USB would be the way to go. I didn't have one at the time, so I had to use 5 DVDs, not the best media to backup a PC.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Laptop Review", "Author": "Larry A.", "ReviewID": "R1VBOAJ01GGYTE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HP Pavilion Laptop Computer has also proven to be a wonderful Christmas gift !

I got mine on Cyber Monday and it is still working great. Never have any problems with the touch screen (other than getting dirty from use), it's pretty average in weight and the speed is fair for someone like me who uses it for about 3-4 hours a day for homework, multi-tab research and browsing. Streaming quality isn't FANTASTIC, but it definitely beats my bulky 8 year old Toshiba.My only prob was with the Windows 8.1 upgrade. (Not the laptop). Before you agree to doing the upgrade, make sure that you look up how to get rid of the Windows 8 data (previous versions). The update didn't replace my old system but instead added a whole other OS. Eventually I will figure it out without being in fear of deleting something essential from my system, but for now having both Windows 8 and 8.1 on my laptop is slowing it down a bit.Overall it's a great laptop so far and it definitely serves its purpose and then some. Touch screen was a nice convenient extra that ultimately led me to purchasing THIS laptop rather than another Toshiba. Makes use of Windows 8/ 8.1 much easier.
