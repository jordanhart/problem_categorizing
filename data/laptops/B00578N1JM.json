{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Computer Apple has ever made", "Author": "JS", "ReviewID": "R158PH76A281YA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer in 2009, when it was released, and I do believe that this is the best product that Apple has ever sold. I would highly recommend this computer to anyone. It's capable of utilizing 8 Gb of RAM (although Apple won't acknowledge it), which I upgraded myself and purchased from crucial. The A1342 is simple to upgrade and replacement of the hard drive & battery is possible, which the newer retina/air models cannot do. Lastly, I prefer the feel of polycarbonate to aluminum. All together, I will continue using this MacBook until the day it dies! Which I hope is long to come.Here's the stats after 4 years: completely compatible with the latest release of OS X Maverics, battery still gets over 5 hours with around 75% brightness (I have never replaced the battery) with 4857 mah full charge capacity and 482 full charge cycles (complete cycles), outperforms most of my friends computers (partially because I know how to keep it running like a Cheetah).", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Turned it into a quasi-Macbook pro", "Author": "tmoody", "ReviewID": "R3COYH44P93NCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I Work on a lot of Macbooks and I'm really not a huge fan of Airs and Pros. Logicboards seem to be real water magnets and it doesn't take a lot to end up with a fried board from a spill. Have ton of laptops and the opportunity came for me to buy one of these that had a bad Gatorade spill, so I did because I gave an i7 pro to a family member and needed an OSX. The older unibody style seems to hold up better to liquid than the newer pros. The heat generated and maybe weathering may lead to some cracking of the case in a few areas, but naturally heat will do that. Probably not a bad thing and allows some heat to dissipate. Easily sealed with electronic grade silicone, and besides, this Macbook was Afghanistan too, so I'm sure that didn't help. Just goes to show how durable it is, I guess.That being said, here's what I did: Pulled the factory RAM and maxed it to 8GB. Pulled the factory 250GB HDD and installed a Seagate Momentus XT Hybrid HDD/SSD 750GB w/64mb cache (could've gone with a full SSD, but opted for more storage). Installed Snow Leopard. Now it runs like lightning. The OSX is nice and light, so it runs really fast. Noticed a huge difference. This model has great potential and is perfect for anyone who doesn't want to fork out a lot of money for an MBP. Since doing this, it's been one my favorite laptops to use.Post add: 12/15 - So, I bought another i7 A1286 (650m GPU)(for me personally) and added a 1TB SSHD. Boot Camped it. The A1342 older Macbook modified boots up soooo much faster. Don't understand this? Would think an i7 would fly. So, I'm going to put in a Samsung Evo 1TB SSD and see what happens. Honestly wondering why I don't just get another A1342 and ditch the i7's. Need to ask Apple directly why the older modified A1342 runs faster than a Pro. Stumped here. These A1342's are great. Buy one and Max it out! Go to Starbucks and and embarrass someone with a Pro i7. \"Boot race\" them!", "Date": "June 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I just love the form factor and the already updated OS it came with.", "Author": "patric martin", "ReviewID": "R3U06DA0943L41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took awhile and I am still on the learning curve of switching keyboard from my iMac keyboard to the layout of this MacBook. and to learn I am upgrade memory to 8 gigs and HDD also to a higher size is a plus win also.", "Date": "April 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "My New Apple Computer", "Author": "Roger L.
