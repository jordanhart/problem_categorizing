At first, the space bar just stopped working. After a whole lot of time on the phone with support, they finally sent someone to come and fix the issue. Now it has issues with the touchpad, where it becomes unresponsive. Once again, I have spent hours on the phone with support (and I have SUCH a hard time with their asian accent!) re-installing drivers and now they refuse to send someone to fix the hardware issue until I completely reformat the machine. If the problem persists they will do something about it.So, long story short, if I could do this all over again I would have purchased this computer from a store with the breakage protection, so I would not have to rely on their phone costumer service.Also, be aware this also does not have built-in bluetooth :(", "Date": "April 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bad mouse pad", "Author": "beansprout", "ReviewID": "R1ZV4CVQQSUZVR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like everyone else, I liked the computer until the mousepad went nuts. The pad works when it wants too but left click button is completly out which is a real pain. The only thing Sony support will tell you is to down load latest version of mousepad driver which of course does not work. Pretty bad when Sony clearly nows there is a problem with these pads but they will not admit it.

The computer is lightweight, has a fairly decent keypad, and the screen with Blu-Ray DVD is very nice for watching videos.  But I have had continous ongoing problems with wifi connection in airports, coffee houses, and have given up taking the computer out of the house for this purpose (unwilling to go yet one more round with Sony support), and just yesterday the touchpad quit.  Read many postings on touchpad problems with the Sony Vaio and this seems to be a consistent problem with a consistently poor response from Sony.  There are many other choices for laptops that don't have these kinds of issues.", "Date": "July 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Problems", "Author": "A.

Now I know Sony is not to blame for a bad hard drive but it is very difficult to have to start everything over every month or so. When the computer works I love it. I love the HDMI output and blu ray player.I also have a terrible time with the touchpad. But mine acts up every few minutes. It will stop responding to my finger and start doing its own thing. Since my computer is in the shop again I brought this item up to them again. Finally they think it might be a bad mother board causing all of my issues.Overall when it works I love it. Since it hasn't worked correctly for the past three plus months I am ready to sell it and buy a Mac.", "Date": "April 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "just a comment on battery life", "Author": "Tarik Akyol", "ReviewID": "R5ZFD0DQ5H4DY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just bought this computer new and wanted to comment on the battery life of this computer since it really disappointed me.

Still runs flawlessly. The touch pad can be a bit finicky from time to time, but it's rare for it to act up at all. I really am surprised that so many people have had trouble with this. Other than the rare touch pad issue, I have not had another hardware issue with the laptop. It has always run great and I plan on using it until it dies on me, which I'm hoping won't be for a very long time. My first laptop before this was from HP and it didn't last more than 2.5 years (the hardware or software). I baby my things, but after 4.5 years it still looks almost brand new and I carry it with me 5 days per week. I would never buy anything other than a Vaio again.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid laptop.", "Author": "Alex \"47\"", "ReviewID": "R22V8GSTPR0YYC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm honestly surprised so many people have had problems with this laptop - I've had it for just over two years now, and haven't had many problems. The whole mousepad thing I haven't had any issues with whatsoever. I did, however, have problems internally.About a year ago - roughly a year after purchase - I had issues where my laptop would suddenly just stop working. I'd turn it off, and it wouldn't reboot without a restore. I had to do that TEN TIMES. Luckily, I had a warranty that I finally used a year later. Yes, I'm that stupid, stubborn, and lazy. Since it's gotten fixed, it's like new again. It's super fast for a 2+ year old laptop, and I'd recommend it if you can get it for the right price.Pros: Not all-too-expensive, Blu-Ray player, textured mousepad, great keyboard.Cons: The battery is absolutely atrocious - only lasts a couple hours at most, hardware issues seem to be problematic for a lot of people.I'd really give this laptop more of a 3.5/5 rating.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "But for the Touchpad", "Author": "RD", "ReviewID": "R2DM7N7T63V5LV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm just going to add in a ditto for all those who are having problems with their touchpads.  I thought I was the only one.  The darned thing will just \"out of the blue\" stop responding to touch and start dancing to it's own music so to speak.  It's frustrating.

It stood out to me at the time because of the blu-ray capabilities and large screen, which make it great for watching movies or hooking up to the TV as a blu-ray player.The keyboard has a very Mac-like look and feel, which I've gotten several comments about. The trackpad has little bumps on it that can be irritating while gaming for an extended period of time, but I rarely notice since I usually have a mouse hooked up.I've put it through a lot and it's stood up well. For the few months were I was a sound technician at my church I used it to record and edit the sermons each week. I think it's a good buy for anyone looking for a general use, mid-range computer.", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Its Awesome..only two things bother me..touch pad and battery", "Author": "Deepkamal Kaur \"Deepkamal Kaur\"", "ReviewID": "R1BKSDKS85UA1C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop in June,2009 and its doing very well. I will breakdown its review in positive and negative points to make it easier for me to describe it.First, the positives:1. I totally love its looks. Its  very stylish, sexy and sleek laptop. The material used is plastic but it doesn't bother me at all as it looks pretty neat and attractive overall.2. The keys are very well-placed and you rarely mistype \"a\" in place of \"s\" or \"w\" in place of \"e\". I used to have this problem with my previous laptop. Keyboard is so appropriately designed that you feel your fingers dancing without typing errors if you type very fast. Ergonomically speaking, you don't need to fight while typing! This was a major plus for me as I type a lott..3. Webcam is good and the motion eye thing works well.4. CD/DVD burner runs smoothly. I haven't used blueray feature till now but its good to have extra features covered in a single device..lol5. It works pretty fast, thanks to its good processor and a pretty good RAM. I do a lot of stuff and my laptop rarely crashes or slows down.6. It has got very good storage space, more than enough for my usage. I store anything and everything on it and still I have so many gigabytes left to save more stuff.7. It has three USB ports and I use two most of the times: one for headphones, and one for printer. I use third port for a pen-drive or bluetooth dongle but have never needed a fourth port.Negatives:1. The battery life is 2 hours or less and not 4 as stated by sony. At this point (8 months after its purchase), its going even down and I am left with 1.5 hours or so of battery life.2. Many times the touch pad stops working and its frustrating when you are doing some important work online and need to scroll or click. This happens with me at least once everyday. I keep a mouse to bypass this..but it would have been better if the touch pad worked well..may be its with my laptop only.3. It doesn't have a bluetooth in it. But you can buy a cheap bluetooth dongle separately and it will work the same way as an inbuilt bluetooth. I am doing the same and its going pretty well so far. So, not much of a negative if you don't use bluetooth very often or opt to buy an external dongle.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this laptop to anyone who is looking for a beautiful wide-screened laptop from Sony Vaio NW-series.", "Date": "January 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Hardware issues, for price could do better.", "Author": "Matt", "ReviewID": "R3G0UCZL10LB81", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The blu-ray option on this laptop is nice.If the video ad graphics card were better this laptop would be much better. If you do intend to play any games and only use this computer for multimedia this would be a great computer.Harddrive failed after 7 months.", "Date": "September 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "like it", "Author": "mindnomad", "ReviewID": "R2UTB2TQ4FJ0U6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this laptop a couple of months ago and I still love it. My last laptop was also a sony vaio so I have no complaints about the quality of the laptop on that end. I just want to mention the color and material is what makes this laptop so different. The color is a dark brown with 'textured undulated waves' as they describe which actually looks like a wood type of material but basically it protects it from scratches and you don't see any fingerprints accumulated like the other lines of the shiny/greasy looking vaio's. The features are great:blue ray, the display off button and the web only button is pretty cool. Keyboard is comfortable and the mouse pad is awesome too because it also textured which gives it a better feel. Highly recommend.update: I changed my rating from 5 to 4 star (which I'm happy amazon now lets you do) and my title from 'love it' to like it only for a couple of reasons. 1) the touchpad has two areas of shiny wear: one horizontal and one vertical each the size of my fingertip.. This has started to bother me because it makes the touchpad look like it has two greasy marks on it. It's not oil it's wear. This is a problem because I have only had it for 8 months. My last vaio was the silver grainy material, and I did not have the same issue with that one. The only reason I upgraded was to get a more powerful system and decided on this one because of the look as I described above. 2) I have had a few instances where the cursor bounces to random places and it has done this when I am typing which is annoying. I've found many posts online where people have had the same bouncing/irratic cursor issue with vaio's.. and that they've had a frustrating experience trying to get support from sony. I am still within the warranty period therefore I will start contacting sony repair in hopes they can just replace the prematurely worn touchpad. Otherwise, no other problems with the labtop.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0027P9BQ0"}}
