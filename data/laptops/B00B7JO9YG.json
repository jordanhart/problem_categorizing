Yes if you compare some other laptops with this one, they may load the operating system faster with one or two seconds, and run the other software faster with 1 sec, but for sure that does not bother me for the price I spend on this laptop, in another word, this one second faster thing does not worth to pay extra $100 or around.It has 2GB of RAM, and 320GB of HDD storage space, for me, no need for more than 2GB of RAM, (and now i'm already opening 13 tab on my internet browser + Skype + watching movie all at the same time ), and for the storage space, it's fair enough, and in future if I need more space, i will get external HDD).Anyone who want a low price laptop with a good shape, nice quality, good branded name, this should be the choose.I tried to check the Asus website for drivers for this product ( as type of checking for future needs and there services, and I found at [...] ) that this product does not need any drivers if you are using Windows 8 32bit, that means all drivers already included in Windows OS.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "performs well", "Author": "Jim MacLaury", "ReviewID": "R1M0HCQ2YEDFOF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All is well with this product except for the touchpad, and that may be more me than anything else.

This computer is for a very laid-back user or media buff or even college student. If you're on a budget, don't care to have all the bells and whistles (touchscreen capability, rotating screen, 500GB+ HDD, etc. and latest Intel system) and just need something that WORKS, then i would definitely say get this one as a starter especially if you're still not too sold on those Linux-based Chromebooks. Personally, I've had this PC for a couple months and so far I've run into no major issues. All pc's crash eventually so just make sure to invest in a proper external hard drive and you'll do just fine. Windows 8 isn't really all as hellish as people made it out to be and again i don't even have a touch screen and i still don't find it that annoying. Setup was pretty straightforward and easy. It updates alot so expect that like every 2-3 days for so called \"important updates\" so you obviously can't use the computer at that time but it usually doesn't take that long.
