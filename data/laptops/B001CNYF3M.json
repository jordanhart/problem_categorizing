(I am still not quite ready to retire my tinier -- but heavier -- VGN-T250, which I really loved.)  I cannot say enough good things about this machine.  The screen is gorgeous.  The sound is really amazing from the speakers.  The webcam is a little tough to find but works very readily.  The fingerprint reader takes some getting used to (take the tutorial!) but what a great security measure.  And as for the machine itself, it is INCREDIBLY fast, and has one of the most comfortable keypads and most sensitive mouse pads I've ever used.  Did I mention how very light the laptop is, how elegantly thin the screen is, and how sensible Sony's power offerings (stamina or speed) are?  You do burn fast through the battery on \"speed\" setting but overall battery life is good even then, better than 2 hours.  I may pick up an extra battery in future just to have some extra juice when an outlet is far away, of course.  Anyway, I think this is a wonderful laptop for the road and frankly would be in the running for me as a desktop replacement.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent machine", "Author": "Roberto Mazzarella \"Beto Mazza\"", "ReviewID": "R2QTBZRKXRF8DL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is my second Vaio and some friends almost convinced me for a macbook...I'm glad with my decision...Sony VAIO rocks!!!", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Vaio I ever owned", "Author": "D.

I previously owned a Sony C1MVP Picturebook, Sony Vaio T350P, Sony Vaio SZ110P, Sony Vaio TXN15P, Sony Vaio TZ150N/B. This notebook is by far my favorite one. It has a nice industrial look to it with the brushed metal and keyboard. It very light for a 13.1 inch notebook only .5lbs heavier than my TZ150 I had before. The screen has 100% color saturation and is by far the best screen I ever seen, that coming from a previous owner of a TZ150. Its powerful and runs Vista without a hiccup. Keyboard is nice and responsive. Nice big trackpad and the buttons are not too loud when clicked. If I had a gripe it would be that it doesn't come with the XP downgrade CD as promised.

Solid build, great look, light and powerful for such a small notebook. Although my laptop arrived with the express card slot flap messed up, it did not ruin my love for this lovely laptop. The monitor is super thin and covered in one material, the keyboard area is covered in a slippery albeit comfy metal feeling material, the bottom is composed of another kind of material and the battery is in its own kind. It sounds like a clump of non matching stuff, but they fit and the design is flawless. For such a small laptop, all the necessary ports are there (vga, 2 usb, ethernet, modem, express slot, wireless, sound i/o). The monitor is super bright if you turn it all the way up, which I doubt you will. It is clean and sharp, however it doesn't glare as bad as some other types of monitor. For the keyboard, I don't know if its my hand or what, but I tend to miss a few letters when typing which may come annoying but it happens rarely and most typing program catches typos for you.My main complaint would be that Sony's crapware really clogs up the system. For the more adventurous souls out there, if you have a stand alone copy of windows vista, WIPE THE SYSTEM AND REINSTALL! I guarantee you this beast will kill your average desktop. Sony's driver website provides all the important drivers in which one should have no problem when reinstalling. Windows 7 users might have some problems as I have yet to be able to get the fn adjust brightness keys to work.The hybrid graphic switch system is really great. It switches really fast and smooth. However as per the power that is saved.. I would say it only differs by about 30 to 50 minutes of work. I have yet to really get the battery to over 5 hours. Dont' know how they adjusted it but I've only managed about 4 hours with bluetooth wireless dvd drive off, and screen to lowest. The laptop under prolonged use does not get hot. Unlike other brands of laptop that just heats up like a stove, sony did a surprisingly incredible job on heat control and truly deserves your attention.My biggest gripe on this laptop will be on the battery however. The battery takes forever to charge from 80% to 100% and loses charge quickly from 100% to 80%. It took me 5 hours just to get from 90% to 100% one time, and while off, it lost 18% in 15 hours. So somehow, the battery likes to stay below.. 80% charge.Regardless, it is an excellent laptop. Excellent build quality and great design.

The computer doesn't come with any usefull free programs, so expect to install your own software, unless you proceed to purchase the pre-installed 30 day trial software already on the computer.

Fair enough they do that, my Toshiba quosmio has been repaired 3 times.Sony however is different, the only way you can contact them is by phone and on a long automated option that left me on hold for 40 minutes at a time.My case was complicated in that I bought my vaio while working in San francisco and moved back to the UK with it. Sony Europe would not honour a US garrantee and so I was forced to send it at my expense to San Diego repair centre.So far I was not really upset, I thought it would return quickly, and I should not have bought such a portable world wide item in the wrong market, obviously you are not meant to travel with it.This is when Sony became a faceless uncaring organisation.

Mine came with he option to \"roll back\" to WindowsXP Professional AND the two DVDs to roll it back were included.  I would not have bought this machine without that option.  VISTA is a terrible opporating system!  But, still I had tons of crapware loaed up from SONY on their roll back DVDs to get rid of.  I wish SONY would not load up all that software by default.  However, the machine is very complicated and I like that SONY had the critical drivers on those XP roll back DVDs.  Had a better equipped machine been available for XP I would have bought it.  There is a lot to this little machine and it is FAST, at least with XP.  But there is a lot to be desired.  For one, the default SONY settings don;t even set up the software to address and take advantage of that huge 6 MB of L2 cache.  For another, by default, the DDR3 RAM is set to run at a lower speed.  Also, I find the instructions, guidelines and recommendations for battery charging & care to be confusing.  Otherwise I would give this machine a 5-star rating.  SONY has a very slow loading website and SONY does not allow users much in the way of options when configuring a notebook.  If I didn't need this fast processor with its huge L2 cache for voice recognition, I would have bought something at half the price with more standard warranty coverage, better support and a lot less crapware.  SONY needs to listen to its customers and give us what we want rather than dictate to us, especially when they want so much money for on of these!UPDATE & WARNING April 18, 2009:While this machine is advertised as having DDR3 RAM that operates at 1066 MHz, the truth is it ONLY operates at a paltry 800 MHz under WindowsXP Professional.  While SONY claims to be working on a fix, be advised SONY has not produced a fix for their SONY VAIO Control Center which appears to be malfunctioning since February when I first contacted SONY for tech support.Moreover, SONY blamed this on Microsoft Window's XP operating system!

Looks great. Feels just perfect. It is an ideal travel laptop. Only one little problem. The unit comes with Vista without any hope (as of now) of downgrading to XP. Why downgrade? Well, because some applications will not run well on vista (or not at all), networking with other computers is a nightmare (if you have XP computers at home and want to share printers or a network drive with this laptop- well it is a shot in the dark and I still can't get it to work right despite hours spent online and on the machine), the OS seems to go out of its way to slow the machine down (a simple example - word2007 opens in less time on a three year old laptop running xp than on this one - and this after I used msconfig to disable most of the startup services).But I have to say, Vista looks really nice and if looks were all that mattered, and you did not need to interact with xp computers or are limited to running standard office applications - then it is a very nice laptop.

However, this one disappointed me upon receipt as instead of spending an afternoon setting my computer up, I spent it on the phone with Sony Support.  If you look at the original listing/advert you see XP Downgrade listed about 3 times, however, a disc is NOT included with the computer, and after placing 3 phone calls to Sony Support, Parts & Accessories, and then Customer Relations, I have learned that one is not currently available with a delivery estimate given of November (it's currently August as I write this!).  This should be clearly noted in any advertisements, as many folks still use and rely upon Windows XP for work and I would not have ordered this computer at this time if I could not downgrade straight out of the box.  VERY disappointing.  I was angered enough to *not* find the downgrade disc included, but to learn that it was not contemplated to meet the release of the computer is negligent and misleading especially in light of the advertising.Other than that, computer looks nice, and reminds me of the TX/TZ with that extra inch or so that I always wanted without going to the size of a full notebook.
