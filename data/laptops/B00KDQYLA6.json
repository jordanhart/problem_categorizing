If you dont mind plunking down the extra $100 for the touchscreen then go for it but really you will do fine without it and save yourself $100 especially if you are buying these as gifts like I did for others in my family.Here is a list of the APPS I use on both and it runs them fast and flawlessly:Facebook, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Chrome Remote Desktop (flawlessly connects to my Windows 7 laptop and I can run any windows program remotely with ease and flawlessly connects to my Office Desktop and I can access all my office records which is key since i am a family doc), Google Cloud Print (easily prints documents to all the printers i have set up), MyBible, Kindle, Twitter, Hootsuite, Weatherbug, Netflix, Pandora, YouTube, Google+ photos (automatically puts all my photos taken on my Iphone over to my chromebook), RUNS ALL WEBSITES INCLUDING BANKING WEBSITES and my mobile hospital app FLAWLESSLY WITH CHROME (including adobe flash player sites which my Ipad and Iphone still wont run)The only CONS i can find so far are no SKYPE app.....If you want to do video calls then need to use GOOGLE HANGOUTS which is much less intuitive than skype....and you CANNOT hook a printer directly to a chromebook but you can use google cloud print to print easily...needs wifi connection to do most things (this is really not a problem for me as i am always connected and they have developed a number of apps that work when not connected including document writer and email offlineBattery Life Amazing! almost 8hrs of use!Touchscreen good but not like an Ipad (can't use your fingers to zoom in with pinch)Touchpad very good!

Initially it meant to serve me as a second laptop for occasional light work online, but very soon I realized that I was using it most of the time. My powerful Windows laptop and Mac mini were just sitting there collecting dust, getting my attention only once a week at best. I replaced my Samsung with Acer C720 2 GB RAM version two weeks ago.Here's a quick breakdown.- C720 has a slightly better screen than Samsung. Same washed out colors, but contrast and viewing angles are better, and so is brightness level. If you are spoiled by the screens of modern tablets, you might think that 1366x768 resolution would look unattractive. That's not quite right. I should remind you that MacBook's Air 11 screen has the same resolution and the same size. It's just enough to do what it's designed to do.- The keyboard layout of C720 may not be as good as Samsung's, but I like Acer's feel and key movement better. Unless you have very large hands, it might provide one of the best typing experiences in the price range below $300, and it's definitely better than most Windows laptops for that price. I write quite a lot and C720's keyboard didn't cause any significant discomfort so far. Touchpad is reasonably good, but nothing to be overexcited about. I only wish it was a bit larger.- C720 is WAY faster than Samsung. Don't be deceived by the name of the processor - this Celeron unit from the Haswell family has more processing power than Chrome OS requires. And 2 GB of RAM should be absolutely enough for anyone, who normally doesn't keep over a dozen tabs running heavy websites simultaneously. The fan would kick in from time to time, but it's very quiet and is never annoying. Boot time is typically impressive for Chrome OS devices and takes around 7 seconds.- Battery life is one of the sweetest spots of this laptop. To get promised 8.5 hours you don't have to keep the screen brightness at 50% all the time (as you would do with the Samsung to get 6.5 hours). I don't carry the charger with me and never managed to make it run out of juice. In fact, sometimes I would even give some boost to my phone's battery from C720 without worrying that it may die unexpectedly. Also, the battery charges pretty quickly.- Speakers of C720 are louder than Samsung's, but they don't sound much better - they shoot down at the table (or your lap) and don't really promise anything. But plug in headphones or external speakers and you'll get some decent sound quality for a low budget device.- The Web Camera on C720 is also superior to the one in Samsung. Promised difference in resolution might not be that visible, but it keeps higher framerate, works better in low light and seems like it captures a wider viewing angle. It is definitely an upgrade. Microphone gets the job done, but it's not very useful in somewhat noisy environment.- C720 is a little bit heavier than Samsung, but by no means it is heavy or bulky. It is still a portable laptop that could be easily moved or carried with one hand. Its build quality is better than most Windows laptops below $350. Obviously, there's nothing special about the quality of materials, but everything feels solid, the lid mechanism is sturdy enough, and overall it's not bad at all. It certainly lacks some style, but it looks and feels more expensive than it costs.I love Chromebooks for the ease of use. The first set up takes about five minutes. They are perfect for kids, for elderly people unfamiliar with computers, for students, for writers, bloggers or even programmers. It's amazing how much stuff can be done in a browser. Online shopping, social networking, managing emails, listening to music, watching movies, reading books, video chatting - everything that most casual users actually do on their computers and even more. Offline capabilities are not forgotten - you can watch movies from the local or external storage, listen to music, work with Google Docs and many other Chrome apps or even games that can run offline. One of the greatest things about Chrome OS - there is virtually no maintenance. You have to try really hard to make it work wrong. Updates are seamless and a complete reset of the system with the Powerwash, in case you want to give it away or sell it, takes just few minutes.I was skeptical when the idea of a Chromebook was introduced to the public. But when I tried one myself and gave it a proper open-minded shot, I wasn't able to go back. Today Acer C720 is my daily driver and I would change it only to a better Chromebook. For $199 it's almost impossible to beat its value. Don't forget, that with the purchase you also get 100 GB of Google Drive space for 2 years. And if you like touchscreens, C720p for $299 is also a very good deal.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive, lightweight and powerful. The C720 2GB version is one of the best buys in tech. Period.", "Author": "Bruce Sweigert", "ReviewID": "R29C5WKSLPBMOY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a technology addict and I've been following the development of ChromeOS for a while. When it first came out, I totally understood the concept but wanted to wait for it to mature a while and the prices to come down. My trigger price point was $200 so when the 2GB version of C720 came out, I had to have one.I find it amazing that such an inexpensive device can do so much. After having it a week, it became my favorite machine just because it is so simple and light. After using it, you come to question why we need such big computing power, huge hard discs and RAM just to run a traditional OS when it comes to supporting the use cases for about 90% of what you use a PC to do. Whats even better, the Chromebook is pretty much ready to go out of the box, with an already pretty rich supply of online an offline apps don't cost you anything extra.Just like tablets came on the market and turned the PC industry upside down because they did 80% of a PC did, and did it with a better user experience, lower price with much less hardware spec. In the same way, I think the Chromebook will have a permanent place in personal tech as the one matching basic needs at the cheapest price - a second PC for around the home, or the \"throwaway\" unit for travel where you don't have to worry about damaging or losing it because its both cheap and highly secure.Specific to the C720 - I agree with most that the screen could be much better but it is still quite acceptable considering the price. The trackpad and the keyboard as well - I have no trouble using them and the trackpad is actually better than many more expensive PCs. I think the build quality is actually quite good - it looks professional and robust enough so that it can survive a road warrior's abuse.The 2GB ram is also the best value in my opinion. I've read a comparison report that showed that the 4GB really has no advantage until you open up 15-20 tabs at once, anything less than that the performance is identical. My own experience (I usually open up only 5 to 10 tabs at once) is that browsing performance is excellent - comparable to my 2013 MacBook Air with 8GB RAM that cost 5x the price.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "A decent \"backup\" computer. If you are low on funds, it can be your main machine in a pinch.", "Author": "Jeffrey Stanley", "ReviewID": "R3BXP4F6Z6VL3G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, the hardware.I have two Macbook Pro machines (a 2009 and a 2010 model), so I have relatively high standards. This is not Apple quality, but it is superior to most cheap Windows machines and far superior to netbook machines.The overall build is 4-star. The keyboard is decent, and short of being backlit, it is almost on-par with Apple's chicklet keyboard. Vs Apple's chicklet keyboard, it has slightly less travel and a different texture, but it is very usable.The machine itself is solid: it doesn't flex and creak like most cheap machines. It is quite rigid and feels solid for a plastic notebook. It isn't as ugly as photos lead you to believe.The trackpad is nice. It is not as flawless as an Apple trackpad, but is responsive and works well. It supports two-finger scrolling (windows-style or \"natural\"). It also supports navigating forward and back with two fingers, although this gesture is definitely less responsive than with Apple's trackpad. The whole trackpad is a button, just like a Mac. You can choose whether to tap-to-click, or not.The big (huge) weakness is the display. Resolution isn't horrible compared to a non-retina Mac, but contrast is pretty bad. Unless you tilt the C720's screen perfectly, contrast is abysmal. I would gladly have paid more if it had a better display. It is the one thing that makes me regret this purchase, even at the low price.Battery life is great. I used this machine earlier this week with streaming music in the background and working on documents for work. It had 20% left after 7 hours.As is clearly stated in the description, this machine contains an OS that simply runs Google Chrome. You can get a great idea of what works and what does not by simply testing tasks in Google Chrome on a Mac, PC, or Linux box.It is surprising what can be done with just a browser. It isn't perfect, but you can do a lot.Below are some of my normal tasks, and how well they can be accomplished with the Chromebook C720.Browsing: flawless. It is full-featured Google Chrome, and it is fast and responsive. It doesn't choke on any web sites or even web apps that I have found. It can handle ten tabs easily (2gb model).Creating simple MS office documents: decent. It can create basic office documents (docs, spreadsheets, presentations) and export them for use in MS office.Editing simple Microsoft Office files: fair. It works with simple spreadsheets and documents. It can \"view\" simple Powerpoint files.It isn't great at handling complex MS office files with lots of formatting. You can probably get by in a pinch, but you will occasionally struggle and there are files you will encounter that just won't work at all.I do not have a subscription to the new \"MS Office 365\" cloud apps, so I can't speak to how well it handles them. If it works as well as Apple's cloud office apps, you should have no problems with Office 365.Edited to add: I tried Microsofts free trial of Office 365. Chrome's web office apps are just as powerful as Microsoft's web apps (though Apple iWork web apps are more powerful than both). The big difference between Microsoft web apps and Chrome web apps is the interface. The MS Office 365 interface is similar to modern MS Office with the big toolbar at the top. Google Chrome web office app interface is simpler and more like Office '97. Neither are super-powerful and I actually prefer Google Chrome's we apps to Microsoft's web apps. The Chrome apps make better use of screen real estate. Neither of them can display heavy formatting found in complex documents.Apple iWork files (Pages, Keynote, and Numbers): great, using Apple's iWork for iCloud. iCloud will warn you that the browser is not supported, but it works great. It works just as well as it does using Chrome or Safari on a Mac. It can't import your iWork files into the offline software, so Apple iWork is a cloud-only online-only option.Amazon Prime Video: failure. It simply does not work at this time (12/7/13)Edited to add: now Amazon Prime Video works fine. ??? Perhaps Amazon had some issue or the machine updated itself, but it works fine now.Netflix: works great.Network storage using the file manager: failure. There is no way to easily connect to my home NAS server or shared folders on other machines on the network using the file manager.NAS access using the browser interface: great. I have a Synology Diskstation NAS. I can watch movies, play music, and download files using the web-based interface just fine.VPN access: failed (using my work VPN). It does have a VPN setup built in, but doesn't work with my company VPN. My company VPN works fine on iPhone, iPad, and almost any computer. This is a big drawback that Google needs to fix.Printing: decent. I have an HP printer that is fully supported and it prints great (HP Officejet 7500). HP \"eprint\" printers have an email address and you just give the C720 this address for printer access. I have heard that it struggles with some printers, but I can't speak to it. The print command brings up a dialog to export your file/image/webpage/etc as a PDF file by default.Photo viewing/editing: very mixed, and mostly awful when offline. One reason I wanted this device was to carry with me along with my camera to view photos on the go. It does have a full-size SD slot (though the card protrudes from the machine and can't be left in the slot for long). The built-in offline image \"editor\" is a joke. It can only view files fitted to the screen. It can do extremely simple tasks like cropping and brightness adjustment, and that's it. You can't even zoom in on an image to inspect it closely with the built-in photo app. With difficulty, I found an offline image editor app called \"Pixir Touch Up\" that does a much better job, and will allow you to zoom in on images from your SD card, but it isn't much better than the stock app. Pixir does offer a very full-featured online photo editor that is on-par with Gimp and others. Remember, the display isn't great and isn't ideal for inspecting photos. An iPad and an EyeFi card (or iPad camera connection kit) are a much better choice for toting along on a photography adventure. Even though the display is poor, it's too bad that Google did such a lousy job with the photo app.Google Chromecast: great! It works well with my Chromecast. It works just as well as when using Chrome on my Mac.Ease of use: decent. If you already have Chrome on a Mac/Linux/PC, you know how to use it. All of you settings, bookmarks, and everything else in Chrome on a Mac just downloads right into the Chromebook.Google Drive storage: fantastic! This machine includes 100GB of Google Drive storage. Google charges $5/month for this great service and Dropbox charges twoce as much for similar service. I am Going to cancel my 100GB Dropbox and save $10/month for two years, which essentially makes this machine free. If you don't know about syncing files between your computers using Google Drive, you need to check it out. It is a bargain at $5, and a steal when free with a usable computer.The machine itself with the current software is a three star item, but it is a great value. It isn't as high-quality as a Macbook or a modern tablet, but it is so cheap that it should be a consideration if you simply cannot afford a high-end machine, or you need a backup machine. It is better than many Windows machines I have used that cost more than twice as much. It would be 4-star-plus with a better display, better file manager, better network support, and better photo viewer/editor. Hopefully Google keeps working on it and eventually upgrades the weaknesses in the software.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic, compact computer with great usability", "Author": "Gavin Fulton", "ReviewID": "R2Z8BH5KBSUQIS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you've been averse to Chromebooks before, you're like me.  There was always something that held me back.  Build quality, lack of computing power, bad battery life, etc.  This one caught my eye, with its specs anyway.  The design of the computer is understated, but the color scheme is nice, as well as the build quality for a budget computer.  Expansion slots are rather generous for this price point as well, featuring USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports, an SD card slot, and an HDMI out so I can expand my desktop and watch movies or videos on my TV if I want.  The only downside is that the shiny black bezel around the screen is rather reflective.  I'm not really sure why they went that route when the rest of the materials are pretty on point.The performance and battery life are where this computer shines the most though.  With only 2GB of RAM, you might think that it will be sluggish.  You'd be totally wrong.  With the newest Intel Celeron Processor with the Haswell Architecture, this thing not only performs well above its class in speed, it simply outdoes any of the previous Chromebooks that are anywhere near this price range.  Startup is merely seconds.  That processor also helps keep battery life very good.  I've been using this computer going on 3 weeks now and I've noticed days where I used it for 7+ hours and I still had decent battery life remaining.  A lot of this depends on what you're using your computer for; whether you're working on text in WorkFlowy, have 8 windows open in Chrome, or have your screen brightness up pretty high watching videos.  I typically keep mine at around 2/3 brightness, as I don't work in very bright places, nor do I need it to be bright.The keyboard is very nice, even though the spacing in the chiclet keys take some getting used to if you're coming from a more traditional PC keyboard.  The Function keys at top are replaced by just keys that do functions.  Makes it simple and way easier to use than some more feature-heavy Windows laptops.  The speakers, which are underneath the laptop, are actually pretty decent considering how small they are.  I prefer to just use headphones anyway, so that's not really a deal breaker for me.  The touchpad is really nice too, considering the price.  Multi-finger gestures work flawlessly and the feel of the pad is very comfortable.  The \"click\" of the pad, if you press down, is pretty noisy, but you really don't need to use it at all.I've been getting lots of questions from friends and co-workers about this little machine and I can't help but highly recommend it, just as long as you know what you're delving into.  There is a learning curve if you've never used ChromeOS before, which I hadn't, but there are handy how-to's and guides built into the OS to help you on your way.  As ChromeOS gets updates and the community of WebApps expands, these machines are going to the be at the forefront of a new revolution of computing.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Absolutely fantastic product, far exceeded my expectations", "Author": "Voltron00x \"Elias\"", "ReviewID": "R2R6AS4AXP6WHW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been reading about Chromebooks all year; the concept was pretty intriguing, despite the fact that I have a bunch of other/similar devices:  an entry-level Sony Vaio from 2011, an X51 Alienware desktop PC for gaming, a 2011 Kindle Fire, and a Moto X smartphone.  So why add a Chromebook?I wanted a multi-use device that could...Stream music from my Amazon CloudStream instant video from Amazon (great selection of kids stuff) and NetflixRun full versions of websitesHave a full keyboard, for writing emails or various other thingsThe Chromebook does all this stuff for basically the same price as a tablet, but it is much closer to a full function PC than a tablet is.  I like it as a video device far more than a tablet.  I like it for using the web far more than a tablet or smartphone.  For items not related to gaming, it has basically replaced my laptop in its entirety.About Chrome OS and this device:  I'm currently streaming music from Amazon with 9 Chrome tabs open and have no issues at all.  I have a hard time understanding what people need 4GB RAM for with this device; how is it useful to open 15+ Chrome tabs?  I haven't run into any performance issues at all.  The boot time is absurd.  7 seconds may be underestimating.  It also shuts off instantly when you hit shutdown.Thus far I've had no real issues with the Chrome store or apps; Google Docs is fine so far for working with MS Word items, and in fact Google Drive is now installed on all my devices because I've started doing my writing on this device.  Remote Desktop lets you connect to any of your Windows PCs for using Windows programs through those computers if you really need to, though I imagine I'd have to be using this more for work to need that for anything.I've used this to watch a decent amount of content on Netflix and Amazon Instant.  The screen is... ok.  It isn't all that bright and won't \"wow\" you but as a portable mini-TV it does the job.  My son loves watching his kids shows on this, which lets us reclaim the real TV for our purposes.  Speaker quality is likewise functional but won't blow you away.  Headphones are the way to go when possible.  As it relates to both of these, I'm perfectly happy with the quality for the price.I didn't have any issues with the keyboard, I'm normally a 90 WPM typer and am probably a bit slower on this, more due to the size than anything.  I actually like the trackpad to be honest.  Not sure why folks don't.  It isn't the worlds greatest but is way better than the one on my Dell PC from work and perhaps marginally worse than the one on my Vaio.  My basic Logitech wireless mouse worked fine with the Chromebook, but I stopped using it pretty quickly as I got used to the trackpad.  The dual-finger scrolling and chrome forward/backward helps a lot.Battery life is pretty nuts.  I've gotten about 7 hours of pure video streaming.  At the high end, just off the charger, you get some arbitrarily high readings (like 9+ hours) but I think the claimed 8 hours is probably accurate.The fact that you can \"hack\" this thing into installing Ubuntu is awesome.  I haven't done it yet, but the concept is very cool.  Native gaming in Chrome OS is miserable outside a few highlights; I'd say the main one is the Chrome version of Bastion, which suggests companies COULD make some great games if they wanted to.  But with Ubuntu, you can theoretically play Linux-compatible games you may have; I know I have a bunch from Humble Bundle (such as FTL) that should run great on this laptop, even if it wasn't meant to do so.  I bet it can run older games very well also, such as Half Life 2 or the original Portal.  My next project is to play around and see if I can pull off Steam and if the 16GB SSD can handle something like that.  If so, I'd give this thing... six stars?  Can't really give it more than I already am.Anyway... know what you're getting into here.  This isn't a full Windows laptop.  You can install Linux and access a lot of full-featured laptop programs that way, but even still, your hard drive space is limited and this may be beyond the basic users capabilities.  If you do video compiling, music or photo editing, gaming, etc. as your main laptop activities, this would need to be a 2nd computer for you.  If you find yourself using alternate devices like a smartphone or tablet in your house for watching movies, listening to music, or browsing the web, you might get great mileage out of this device. I know I have.Highly, highly recommended device.  I love this thing.EDIT: Just over 90 days of use later, and I can tell you that I've completely fallen in love with this device. It is the fastest Chrome device in my house, far faster than the dual-core Sony Vaio it replaced and even faster than my core i7 Haswell gaming desktop. I've installed Ubuntu 13.04 and 13.10, both XFCE and Unity, through both USB 3.0 and SD card, and played Minecraft and Steam games on this thing. The batter life is still epic. What else is there to say?  This is, hands down, the single best value buy in all of computing right now.If you want to read more about Chromebooks and you're not sure if they're right for you, check this out:  [...]", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great buy for college students!", "Author": "IlyaF", "ReviewID": "R1JSGOY9VFN4A3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Acer C720 is the perfect laptop for students. I just bought this chromebook from Best Buy primarily because I wanted something light and compact to carry around campus. I have a Windows laptop that's fully loaded with a SSD, Core i7, 8gb ram, etc. All of that is fast but my laptop weights nearly 7 pounds and honestly those specs are overkill for what I need. I'm a biochem major so I don't need fancy AutoCAD or photoshop programs. All I need is document editing, browser, and a PDF viewer.The first thing I tried once I bought this little guy was opening up my PDF textbooks. I put the text books on my flashdrive, transferred them to the onboard storage and it worked! The textbooks open up offline in Chromes PDF viewer. It's brilliant! That was my main concern. I uploaded my entire iTunes library (about 4,000 songs) on to Google Music. It took several hours to upload but now I have all of my music on the cloud and it's ALWAYS with me. Yes, you will need an internet connection to listen to it but my campus has wifi everywhere. I even get connection outside between buildings.In terms of hardware, this chromebook is much thinner in person than it appears in the pictures. It is also quite a bit smaller than I was expecting but that's not a bad thing. The keyboard is slightly smaller than I would like and the keys are extremely shallow. It doesn't bother me but it'll take me a little bit to get used to. People have been saying that the trackpad is loose but I don't find that the case. I actually find it rather pleasant to use and it has many gestures that come on Apple computers. The screen is awesome on this. Sure it's not an IPS but this matte display has ample brightness, clarity, and size. I quite enjoy it. The speakers were surprising. I was expecting something sub par but for a $199 laptop, they really deliver. The bass could be stronger but I think they sound nice as they are. Lastly, the batter is awesome! The computer had no charge when I got it but it took less than an hour to charge to 100% once I plugged it in. When I unplugged it, it should 9:42 till empty! WOW! That's with two tabs open.For those wondering how the 2gb compares to the 4gb, I've got to say that the 4gb is overkill unless you open more than 30 tabs some of which are all playing video at the same time. Who does that though? I typically have 4-5 open. Occasionally, I could get up to 10 but that doesn't slow this machine down at all. I'm glad I went with the 2gb as I would never find use for the extra 2 gb of ram.This is definitely a great buy. I was really hesitant for about a month. I just couldn't decide but with Best Buys holiday return policy, I decided to give it a try. I definitely will not be returning this.

Many people that have given this a poor rating is because they believe it needs internet access to do anything. They obviously bought this type of computer for the wrong reason, and not enough knowledge. If you want to use it as an only online computer in chrome os, go ahead... But that is only using half of the potential, if not less, that this machine has to offer.Personally I use this computer for programming, and as a media device to randomly plug into tv's and such. I also use this any time I am not at home, seeing as it is so portable and has an easy 10 hours of battery life, its great.Another reason people dislike this product is because it can't play games. Well it can... Personally I don't game on this computer, I have another computer dedicated to that, and I use the chromebook to be productive, but if I really wanted to, I could install steam on any decent version of linux (debian, arch, fedora, centos, ubuntu, etc.) and play games. I have seen people play Skyrim on this chromebook (albeit on the lowest graphics settings).Overall, it is a great computer, but you should really try and unleash the full potential of it yourself, or else you won't be having the best time you could with your new chromebook.EDIT: An easy way to make your chromebook run chrome os and another version of linux is to google search \"crouton\" and go to the \"dnschneid/crouton \u00b7 GitHub\" entry, and follow the instructions. It basically installs the chosen distro of linux inside chrome os, and you run it inside chrome os, allowing you to seamlessly switch between both os's at any time with a simple key combo. Personally I use Debian Jessie with LXDE, if you don't know what I just said, just follow the instructions, which will give you Ubuntu with XFCE.Also, to do this you need to have your chromebook in developer mode. You can do this by:  -Press and hold the Esc+F3 (Refresh) keys, then press the Power button. This enters recovery mode.  -Now, press Ctrl+D (no prompt). It will ask you to confirm, then the system will revert its state and enable developer mode.  -Press Ctrl+D (or wait 30 seconds for the beep and boot) at the white boot splash screen to enter Chrome OS.

I have many computers, but nothing browses the web and renders web pages faster than this chromebook.  It does boot in 7 seconds or less and you can have many tabs open and still browse with great speed. The keyboard and mouse are sufficient too.  I would put them in the \"average\" category and they get the job done.  There are no issues and it is easy enough to type that I am writing this review on the chromebook.The battery life is also exceptional.  I easily get 7 hours on a charge and rarely have to carry the (also light and small) charger.  That is a plus for me as a student and a teacher.The C720 won't win any beauty contests (unlike the HP 11 Chromebook) but the beauty is on the inside.  If you want a chromebook, this is the best of the bunch in this price range.  I will not be getting rid of this chromebook anytime soon. This is what a chromebook should be!", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love my Chromebook!", "Author": "Emma", "ReviewID": "RHQTM0RWW7K3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm in my last semester (hopefully) of my undergrad and my 4 year old HP Envy quit on me in the first week of this semester. I've had my Chromebook for about a month now, so I think I'm a little qualified to leave a pretty accurate review.Overall, I absolutely love my Chromebook. It is an amazing little device and I will probably never go back to a PC (I'm not a Mac person at all so I can't compare it to them). Now, as a disclaimer, I am not someone who does online gaming or software video editing. At most, I'll edit some pictures and maybe edit some music files, so I cannot attest to this devices ability to fulfill those needs (though it doesn't seem like it would be very compatible with them). However, as someone who needs a computer mostly for internet, research, email, music, social networking, and document editing, this thing is amazing.PROS1. Speed. This thing is a beast. It comes out of a sleep faster than my Kindle will start up (if I shut it down, not just if I wake it up from sleeping). It's kind of incredible how fast it boots. Internet browsing and document editing is awesome, video viewing is great (YES, this OS IS great for Netflix and online streaming, don't believe what you've heard if it is contrary to what I just said).2. Display. I really like the Chrome OS layout (it's pretty similar to Windows 7, which I liked a lot more than any devices with Windows 8 that I've tried--my phone has Windows 8 and I kind of hate it now that I have my Chromebook). It's intuitive and simple--the whole setup process for me took like ten minutes tops.3. Sync with Google. I can access all of my stuff EVERYWHERE. I used Google Drive before, but not as heavily. It is soooo so nice to have all of your material on whatever computer you may have access to.4. Apps. Google has come out with some really useful apps for these devices and they're only making more.5. Hardware. I love the way this Acer laptop is set up. The sound is surprisingly wonderful for such a small machine, AND it has separate \"speakers' and \"headphones\" settings for sound. No more plugging my headphones in, forgetting I had the volume cranked earlier that day, and having my ear drums blown out. It's a simple but beautiful thing and I don't know why more manufacturers don't do it. The top row of keys is as follows: Escape, Back (internet browser button), Forward, Refresh, Fullscreen, I don't know what to call the next button but if you hit it it brings all the things you have open up on your desktop screen and you can click on what you want to go to, Dimmer, Brighter, Mute, Volume Down, Volume Up, Power. The \"programs\" button is awesome, I use it all the time to get to something else that I have open but don't want to scroll through everything to find, and having the internet back, forward, and refresh buttons on the keyboard is surprisingly nice. Some people say they're worried about hitting the power button accidentally, but to turn it off you have to hold it for a few seconds, so it's difficult to do it by accident. The screen is matte, so you can still see things if you're outside or by a window, and the trackpad is awesome--two finger scroll, click with two fingers for a right click, and you can enable tap to click in the settings (which I was thrilled with because I hate pushing down every time). Unfortunately, though, there's no zoom feature on the trackpad. That's my only complaint about it. This thing is SO lightweight overall--with my old computer, if I lugged it around campus my shoulders would kill me, but with this one I can barely tell it's in my backpack.6. Sleep/Occasional Crash Recovery. Any time I've put this to sleep, turned it off without closing things, or had it run out of memory and need to restart abruptly, I have not lost a single thing. Are crashes desirable? No. Do they happen? Yes. Does this thing deal with them well? Absolutely. On a computer with only 2 gb of RAM I kind of expected a few crashes because I can be a heavy internet browser, but when it restores itself, all my tabs come back and whatever I was working on is safe.7. Battery Life. Battery life battery life oh my gosh battery life. I am AMAZED with it. One day I was using it to watch Netflix and bum around on the internet and the battery was at about 60% and I didn't have to plug it in for FIVE hours. On a full charge, it will do at least 8 if you're not watching videos, and about 6 or 7 if you are. It's absolutely incredible and if it's the one reason you buy this computer, I wouldn't judge that decision (other than to say it's totally reasonable). It's wonderful and cannot be matched. It's also super convenient when I need to take it to class and am not sitting close to a power outlet. My old HP would get 3 hours MAX when the batter was new. If this computer only lasted 3 hours, I would wonder what was wrong with it. The lack of a need to plug in is a beautiful, beautiful thing and it is definitely unparalleled.8. Google Docs. At first I was worried about not having Microsoft Word, but honestly, Google's line of word processing programs are so similar that it doesn't even matter. You can save things as .docx or .pdf and then anyone can view them in the \"traditional\" format. It's absolutely not necessary to have Microsoft Word. Plus, there are plenty of converter apps that Google has to view things from other people and turn them into Google Docs so you can edit them, and then turn them back into pdfs or whatever you need.CONS1. Sometimes it crashes. It happens with all computers. However, as I said, it reboots well and I've never lost anything.2. The fact that all my stuff is on the cloud... I'm a little uncomfortable with it. I have an external hard drive with most of my files on it (especially videos and stuff). I've never had any problems with hacking, but it worries me slightly. However, Google is constantly improving security, so I'm not ALL that worried. The nice thing is that you can set up \"2 Step Verification,\" so when you (or potentially someone else) log into your google account from a previously unused computer, you have to supply your password AND google sends your phone a text with a code to put in. You have to have your phone to log in, but this gives me a little more peace of mind.3. Desire to Learn (this online software that my school uses for virtually everything) issues. The dropbox on Desire to Learn won't let me upload files. This has been an absolute pain and I have to make sure that I either have my Kindle Fire charged so I can send PDFs to it and then upload them with that, or that I'm on campus so I can use a public computer to turn in my assignment. This is my biggest complaint and I hope I can resolve it eventually, though I don't know how I could do it on my own.4. Printing. I haven't sat down yet to try to connect my printer to cloud print. I know there are directions, I know you are supposed to be able to print with Chromebooks, but there are so many extra steps that I just haven't bothered with it yet. I've resorted to printing on my campus and my printer has gone dormant. Maybe eventually I'll hook it up and change this to a pro, but for now, it's a hindrance.5. File Explorer. The file explorer is pretty simple but is sometimes kind of glitchy. Usually if I put my computer to sleep and wake it up again it solves that problem, but it's annoying nonetheless.FINAL VERDICTOverall, if you're not a huge gamer or video editor, this computer is amazing. All these great features combined with the outstanding price make it a fantastic choice for those who just use computers for internet and document editing. Contrary to Microsoft's Chrome OS slam commercials, IT IS NOT USELESS WITHOUT AN INTERNET CONNECTION. No, you can't access websites, but you can't do that offline with a PC anyway. You can still make documents and they'll just save to your small hard drive and sync with Google Drive later. It saves the most recent things you've worked on, and if you want more you can use an external hard drive or flash drive (or physically move files to the offline drive) to access more files offline. Honestly, though, I'm so rarely without an internet connection that it doesn't even matter anyway.I would recommend this computer wholeheartedly (and have many times in the past month). It's compact, intuitive, useful, and does almost everything a common PC will do.

I have been wanting a Chromebook for some time but wasn't sure what to expect.  I was really impressed with my Acer tablet that was low cost but clearly a solid device, so when Acer came out with this Chromebook with the new Haswell processor I decided to jump on it.  I care more about performance than looks so I went with the Acer since it was getting good performance reviews.  I was also looking for a another small and light computer that I could take with me when I travel for work that I could use for my personal use - I like to keep personal and work usage completely separate.I have been using this laptop for several weeks now and I am very impressed.  This is now my favorite computer!  I did upgrade the SSD drive to a 64Gb drive which seemed to improve the performance and I have been pleased every since.  As Google says, it is instant on and off so you never wait.  The battery life seems to last forever.  It far exceeds any other laptop I have every had, especially at this extremely low weight.  I love that TPM is build into the platform for heavy encryption of the storage and I like having separate profiles between users.It is a shift to have your data and applications come from the cloud but it works and completely integrates with my phone, a Samsung Note 3.  Once I got familiar on how to use my Chromebook and Google tools, I decided to move all of my personal content to my Google Drive - all of my pictures, documents, music, etc.  I encrypt sensitive information with Boxcryptor on my Google Drive.  This works well on my Chromebook and my phone.  I am now using my C720 for doing just about everything I use a computer for - creating and editing documents, editing and posting pictures, doing video calls and messaging with Google Hangouts. watching movies, listening to music and more.By the way, the wireless radio on this laptop is amazing.  I have not seen another laptop beat it in speed tests on my wireless network - this includes custom gaming laptops with special wireless cards, a Macbook pro, iPads, phones, etc.  Only my Samsung Note 3 with support of 802.11ac comes close.  I couldn't believe it at first but test after test showed the same result.  Simply amazing especially at this price point!  I am not sure how Acer did this.Wi-Fi access in Google sponsored locations is automatic as well.  I noticed that I got instance access in some locations without hitting the captive portal page and having to go through a registration process to get Internet access.  That is pretty cool.  When I travel, I like this laptop to my mobile hotspot on my phone and I am connected whenever I want to be.There are times when I am using unsecured public Wi-Fi that I like to get my access through a VPN tunnel so I set up my Chromebook to use a L2TP VPN tunnel.  You can set it to automatically connect to the VPN server once Wi-Fi is connected and this works very reliably.I also use this laptop with an external mouse, keyboard and monitor in docking mode.  I was even more surprised to see this laptop drive the display on my laptop while also driving my external display that is a 1080p monitor through HDMI.  You can extend the display or mirror your laptop display.  Either way works very well and I have never had even one issue, which is rare.  I have seen Macbooks and Windows computers choke on driving external displays more often than they should.Watching video on this laptop has been a very good experience as well.  I watch Netflix, YouTube & Google movies and my own video files with no issue on my laptop or with an external display.  The video is very smooth.  By the way, any Google movie you buy can also be watched through YouTube.This laptop will also reach multiple file systems on USB drives.  I have tried Windows and Linux partition formations without issue.In summary, this is a solid device from Acer.  This laptop will spoil you and delivers far more value that most laptops several times more expensive.  It is easy to use by design but it is very functional for a wide range of users.  I am recommending this laptop to everyone looking for laptop.  There are some new ways of doing things in the Google Chromebook model but I think that is an easy transition to make and will greatly simplify your life once you do!  I also suggest looking at some of the Chromebook books on tips and tricks.

Before you read this entire review you need to know that this is a Chromebook. If you already know what a Chromebook is then go to the next paragraph. Chromebooks can't run .exe files like a PC or a Mac can. It does most things in the Chrome browser. So if I wanted to play Cut The Rope, I would go on the Chrome Web Store, \"download\" it, and it's, \"installed.\" Then, when I want to play Cut The Rope, I press the Cut The Rope button and it opens up Google Chrome on a certain webpage where you can play Cut The Rope. So If you wanted to play Minecraft, you shouldn't get a Chromebook because Minecraft and pretty much anything that you need to download (like Microsoft Word or Spotify) is probably a .exe file. But you can still do a lot of stuff on a Chromebook. Google Docs lets you edit documents and you get 100 GB of Google Drive storage on Google's servers, or \"The Cloud, \" to edit and store your documents. Also, Microsoft has Word Online which lets you, well, use Microsoft Word and store it in \"The Cloud,\" except you store it on Onedrive instead of Google Drive, unless you download it onto the Acer C720's 16 GB solid state drive. (At least, I got the 16 GB version. It also comes in a 32 GB version.)  So, for the nerds, here are all the technical specs:OS: Chrome OSProcessor: 1.4 GHZ Intel Celron 2955UMemory: 16/32 GB storage, SDD (There are two types of hard drives: SDD and HDD. SDD works like a flash drive and a HDD has a disk. SDD's have bettery battery life and speed up the computer a lot.) 2GB RAM, and a free 100 GB on Google Drive. Also has an SD card slot.Screen:11.6,\" LCD, 1366 x 768, 135.09 ppiConnectivity: HDMI, two USB 3.0 ports, Bluetooth 4.0, and Wifi.Battery: I couldn't Google the MaH in the battery, but it lasts about 7.5 - 8 hours.Ok, so after I wrote all that I just noticed Amazon has the specs right on it, so you can also look at that if you want.Now, for the actual laptop on the outside. Even though it only has a pixel density of 135 ppi (pixels per inch, 135 is terrible), it still works and shows me what's on the screen. Unless I'm not looking at it. The speakers work great, and if you plug in headphones it automatically adjusts it so it doesn't scream in my ears. And when I take them out, it makes the speakers loud again, so I can still hear it from about a foot away. It's really thin and light, I can carry it with one hand under it while it's turned on easily. The battery life on this is amazing, it's one of my favorite parts of the C720. Lastly, the processor on the C720 is decent. It's fast enough for a laptop, and great for a $200 laptop.In conclusion, this is a good laptop. If you like video games, a nice screen, or anything that you need to download, then I'm wondering why you would be reading this review in the first place.

I originally bought it for travel to Hawaii for reasons why chromebooks were built and designed for - ultra light, long battery life, laptop design (prefer over tablet type). The most significant positive feature that struck me about this Acer C720 was its remarkable time usage. I knew it was long as reviews that I read stated but it was even more impressed. I remember my first morning I woke up (very early start as Hawaii time zone was three hours behind PT), turned on my C720 at 4 AM and used it until 2 PM.

It serves a introduction to computing for new users and as a good traveling computer for PC users. Acer and YouTube have many tutorials on the features and use of Chromebooks. Check these out before you buy.Tablets and Chromebooks are similar in a lot of ways. They are primarily for online use, they have very short boot up times, they don't drain much power in standby mode, and the price range is about the same. My Acer C720 boots in less than 10 seconds and goes several days in standby without a recharge. and cost $200. My Nexus 10 cost $400. Both tablets and Chromebooks require much less upkeep than a PC, for things like backup and virus protection. And the complexity is much reduced from that of a PC. There are fewer options, so there is less confusion in learning how to accomplish the tasks you want to do on a computing device. And, every hacker is not trying to download stuff on your device that you don't want. So when you evaluate a Chromebook, compare it more to a tablet rather than a PC.Where Chromebooks and tablets differ is in productivity. Tablets have a touchscreen and apps which are convenient for consuming information, but the browsers are substandard compared to a PC, and there is no real keyboard for data entry. In that respect, Chromebooks are much more like a PC. For new users contemplating buying a PC, a Chromebook is a much shorter path to learning how to use a PC, than a tablet. For less than half the price of a PC a Chromebook is a cheap and easy way to get into computing, and it may be all that a lot of people will ever need.The Chromebook can be set up to do the same things you can do on a PC with the Google Chrome browser. However, it's not limited to Google applications, only applications that work within the Chrome browser. Any web application that works in the PC Chrome browser works on a Chromebook. For example, Microsoft SkyDrive, Netflix, Spotify, Pandora, RSS readers, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, gmail, Outlook mail, etc, all work in the Chrome browser so they also work on a Chromebook just like they work on a PC. This is not true of tablets. Tablet apps are configured differently from PC applications.If you're using the Chrome browser now on your PC you know that it has many extensions like Add This sharing, Readability, Hangouts, free Google phone calling, etc. These are all available on the Chromebook. As a PC user, my Chromebook fits my particular needs much better than my Nexus 10 tablet.

At first, the switch was weird, as it would be for anyone in any situation where one uses an unfamiliar device. But once I figured out how to utilize and customize the Chrome OS to my liking, I've become a very happy Chromebook user.After I set everything up to my liking, I started noticing a lot of nay-saying about the Chromebook I've come to love and use as my primary computer. A lot of this negative talk has come from Microsoft and, I suppose, power users. Or people who just don't like Google in general.But I digress on the latter because that's such a heated topic and that's not what I want to write in my review about. What I do want to do, though, is dispel this misconception that the Chromebook is a total brick without wi-fi.Here's what I can do offline:- Listen to music- Read epub and mobi ebooks- Read pdf files- Write txt, docx, and gdoc files- Get to my Google Drive- Play games (though I'll be honest, I don't play games on my Chromebook, but I know it is something I could do if I wanted; it's just that any game you want to play has to be on the Chrome store and it needs to be made for both online and offline use)- Read email- Create mindmaps- Create notes on Google Keep- Create tasks on WunderlistNow, one may still think that's still not a lot, but let's keep this in perspective: this is how I utilize my Chromebook every day, excluding whatever browsing I might do on the Internet. And these are the only tasks that I want to have if I'm offline. When I'm online, I do a lot of other stuff, granted--but for those days I might not have wi-fi, I can rest assured knowing I can at least do what I need to do on my Chromebook without any issues or panic.So clearly, the Chromebook isn't a brick offline. All the essentials are there. And honestly, I find it much nicer because there's less distraction. I can focus on my tasks throughout the day instead of fiddling with my desktop and groaning about using a laptop that I feel like I will never utilize completely. In that way, Chromebook shines. It's not for everyone, but it is for someone like me.EDIT: I also want to add that I watch videos online, on YouTube and other websites, and it works wonderfully. I have no complaints. In fact, I've found that videos load more quickly on this Chromebook than it did on the HP laptop I used to have. On the HP laptop, if I was watching a movie online, it'd take an hour or two to load completely. On the Chrome OS, the same video might take, what--5 or so minutes to load.

It does the job expected, in a very competent fashion.I bought it after an in-store trial of 3-4 different Chromebooks.  This one was clearly faster, snappy compared to molasses (the other models) at loading a complex web site.  I still feel like I never wait for it to do something.  Now, I'm not opening more than 2 windows at a time, nor do I expect this to be a high end gaming device or a monster calculation machine.  I bought it because I got tired of 5 minute start times on my other machines.  I've got two Win 7 laptops that take forever to be ready for use.  The Chromebook is absolutely ready in 5-7 seconds, every time.The battery lasts a very long time.  In my typical short daily uses (5 minutes here, 20 minutes there), it seems to last about a week.Chrome has opened every web site successfully.  No problems.  I had no problems using Logmein to remotely access a work computer (but with their recent company issues I have switched to VPN on Win 7.  I haven't tried VPN on the Chromebook).I was surprised there wasn't a direct WiFi link to my printer.  The free Cloud Printing from Google works fine...perhaps a few seconds more delay reaching the printer than my local WiFi would give.Mostly I'd say the take home lesson is that you turn it on (quickly!) and it just works.

The screen, although bright and good resolution, has problems when viewed at angles and not straight on. Another quirk I wish there was fast user switching but to switch to another user you have to sign out and the other user signs in.  Surely it is like this so that a latent user profile doesn't eat system resources, but fast user switching would be a nice option.Now everything else about this machine is everything you could hope for @$199.

I was undecided whether to go for the C720 or the C720P- the touchscreen option but eventually opted to go with what I had tried and tested. Got it less than 24 hours ago.We already have a Macbook Air, Macbook Pro and an iMac at home. I got the Chromebook for myself- passing on the Air to the kids.Very happy with my choice. Can do everything I do with the Air except one (coming to it soon). I browse the net, open and save all MS Office files- Word, Excel, Powerpoint. Just downloaded the 3 Office applications from the Chrome Store- haven't tried them out as yet. Even if that doesn't work out the Google options are pretty good.I can browse any website, save files locally and print (via Google Cloud Print). I am an Android user (Nexus 5) and most of the features available on the Chromebook either supplement or complement what I already had on the phone. Some of them are given below:Google+ Photos: My photos from my phone are already automatically backed up to Google+. Photos from our iMac (main repository of photographs) are also automatically to Google+. The Google+ Photo app in the Chromebook just enhances the experience of browsing those photographs though one could also look at it in the Chrome browser in Google+Google Cloud Print: I can easily print from the phone and the Chromebook does the same. I have a HP 3510 and it connects to the printer via HP ePrint.Evernote: I use the Evernote for web. Works very well, in fact is faster than the desktop application in the Mac. Doesn't work offline though. I also use the Chrome browser extension for Evernote to add notes and clip web pages very well. Another alternative could be Keep (from Google).Google Drive: works just like the phone. Accessible even offline. And with the 100GB of storage for 2 years it is a great plus. If you do end up using the 100 GB, even after 2 years if you don't want to pay for it- it should still work- you just won't be able to save more files above the free (15GB) limit but be able to access all the existing files in the Drive.Hangouts: works with the Chrome browser extension or within Google+.Speed is excellent. The battery life is just out of the world. It is like a camel in the desert without water- it can go on and on and on.What's my biggest gripe? Skype. I use it pretty often and it is the choice of most when it comes to video calling, across the world. The alternative offered is Hangout video calling. But as a medium of communication this is still to catch on and this is the most restrictive feature of the Chromebook. Akin to Skype Out, Hangouts also provides the facility to call phones and mobiles by buying credit- works across the world and not only specific countries (the purchasing of the credit).Of course the requirement of being on line for most of the tasks is also restrictive but then that is a given and known when you buy the Chromebook.Two other products which I have figured out are not available but might be high use apps are Spotify and Picasa. The latter is surprising considering it is from Google, but I think the objective is to push everyone onto Google+ Photos.Sound is excellent. Has a small bass and is more than adequate.Overall- this (and any Chromebook) can not be your primary PC/laptop. But is a must get for easy access, browsing and great battery life.

Daniel Spratlin", "ReviewID": "R2MMR5JYKJCCUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the Acer C720 to have something lighter to carry around. I have a Dell Windows laptop that's has incredible specs; however, I don't find myself ever using it to its maximum capabilities. So why should I drag around 6.5 lbs with me all day? The Acer C720 is incredibly light and it's much thinner than it appears in the pictures. The build is very nice for a $199 laptop. It uses a sturdy matte colored plastic which I actually find rather attractive. It doesn't look toy-like.The screen is something that many people have complained about but I find it perfectly satisfactory. The resolution is good enough for the size of the screen and it's plenty bright to be used in sunlight especially since it's a matte display. The keyboard is nicely spaced and the keys feel okay at best. The keys are very shallow which I don't particularly like but I can understand why they had to do that. It takes a little bit of time to get used to but after a day's use, the keyboard should feel fine. My WPM fell about 10 from my average 85-90 WPM on a desktop keyboard but after several days, I'm starting to get back up to that range. The trackpad is really nice. It has a nice smooth texture and it's responsive. I don't know what some of the other review have been saying about it being loose. Mine is definitely sturdy. It does make a loud click but if you turn on \"tap to click\" you'll only actually have to make a loud click when you have to grab and drag something.I bought this laptop to primarily use out and about for work so it was very important for me to have it open my PDFs. I put my PDF files on the 16gb hard drive and they open right up with the Chrome PDF viewer. Perfect! All of my documents, music, and photos were already in the Google cloud so as soon as I turned the laptop on, everything was ready to be viewed.The battery is rather amazing as well considering how light this laptop is. The machine came with no power. Once I plugged it in, it took just over an hour to charge. On my first charge, I've managed to get just under 9 hours! Wow! My usage was pretty light though. Primarily opening up books, reading news, typing two emails, and watching a couple of youtube videos. Still, that's an awesome battery life.In terms of Chrome OS, I think it has a perfect balance between simplicity and functionality. Sure, it can't run Photoshop or autoCAD, but I think the majority of people don't use those programs. I, personally, don't need anything more than what Chrome OS offers. If you really need some kind of editing tool, the Chrome Store has replacement apps that can get the job done. You just have to look for those apps or just Google search for them.Speed on this little guy is incredible! I can't believe that a $199 machine can work this quickly. Pages load up almost instantly and that includes videos. In terms of browser performance, the Acer beats my Windows laptop (which has a Core i7, 8gb ram, and a SSD). I don't know how Google accomplished this but it's truly incredible. I think the 4gb model is overkill. This 2gb model has not slowed on me. I use a max of about 10 tabs. The laptop never lags or skips a beat with that many open. I personally don't use more than that at any one time; however, I've heard that this thing can handle up to 20 tabs without slowing down. I can't imagine how many you'd need to open for the 4gb model to slow down.In general, this is a 5 star machine.

Let's see...Since receiving the Acer Chromebook C720-2848 several days ago, I've come away with a brand new perspective on the Chrome operating system. Here's my take on it and why, if your needs aren't completely dependent on Windows, this may be just the right call for you.First, what is a Chromebook? It is a laptop with its own system that relies on everything Google, and runs the operating system \"Chrome OS\".  Chrome OS does not allow for \"programs\" to be run in the manner that Windows or Mac does. It is almost fully browser-dependent (but not to the extreme that you can't use the computer without an internet connection). You run \"programs\" in the Chrome browser, and they run quickly and efficiently, with hardly any hesitation. Unlike that of Windows' program launching, Chrome OS is nearly immediate and glorious in its ability to do your bidding.The first thing you will note about the system is that it boots in under 7 seconds so that you can come from a cold start to having logged-in and ready for work or play. I am used to having my Windows 7 installation tweaked for high performance, but the Chrome OS needs no help there.  A few things before I really get into it should be noted:There is no firewall to configure; no need for virus protection; system is automatically updated without bother, and has an SSD (solid state drive for virtually noiseless computing), and can run up to 8 to 9 hours on one charge.  The OS requires no license validation and can be re-installed quickly if need be. Sounds intriguing? Stick around and hold on to your wig because this thing will flip it!This particular model is the C720-2848, at $200, a revamping of the older C710.  The Intel Celeron Haswell architecture brain that runs it is quite faster than the prior model, C710's Celeron brain, and comes with either 2GB of DDR3 ram or, for more handling power, 4GB, for $50 more. It appears for most users that is over-kill, as most won't have more that 10 to 12 windows running at the same time. My model is capable of having several Youtube videos playing, and several other windows open, with no adverse hit in performance. Should you choose to try a Chromebook, don't pick the older model, regardless of sales discount inducement.When you boot into your Chromebook you are met with a desktop, similar to a Windows PC, but there are no icons on the desktop. Instead, there is a sidebar where you chose which program you wish to use. You want to surf, you click the Chrome icon, and you are quickly sent off to the internet. There is also an apps icon that you click in order to see all of your applications that are available to you. These applications can be downloaded (downloaded here means: the shortcut to the application that will play in the Chrome browser) from the Chrome Store. You can build quite an impressive amount of useful apps for work or play and delete them (getting rid of the shortcut to the application) as you see fit. An example of a utility app is Screencastify, a screen video recorder that can record all you do with or without sound. You can also capture video with the webcam. Snagit, from Techsmith, is another useful app for screen recording or snapping shots of anything that you want on any page you go to.  Another useful application is Clearly, an app that rids pages of all extraneous litter, leaving only text so that you can read or save it.  There is a growing lineup of games that can be played via the browser as well, one of which is still popular, Angry Birds. You won't be able to play more demanding games, but this is not a gaming computer. As more and more users Skype now than ever before, Chromebook users are not as fortunate. But you can use Google Hangout for calls and video chatting. All sorts of utility apps and more are populating the Chrome Store, so this is just the beginning of what may turn out to be a most welcome and fast-growing app market for your Chromebook.The Chromebook can not accept printers via usb (remember: you can't install programs), but you can wirelessly print via Google Cloud Print to your printer as long as you have a printer that is capable of cloud printing. Nearly all printers for just under $100 have this feature today.Typing on the keyboard was an unexpected pleasure, as I have never been able to type comfortably with any laptop I've ever used. The touch pad is responsive and utilizes the familiar one finger mouse move, and two and three finger gestures, the latter being for scrolling back and forth through the open windows. You can plug in a usb or wireless mouse and keyboard, but you probably won't need to.As for music play, the speakers for a low-cost computer as this sound great.  There's appreciable loudness with hardly any noticeable shrill at very 80% volume. The is some slight bass, not heavy and shouldn't be expected on this laptop.  The bluetooth works with newer versions and is backwards compatible with bluetooth 2.0 and up.For light users of Microsoft Office, Google Docs takes over the job. It will read, write and edit the documents. Just don't expect it to be on par with its very expensive brotheren.This model comes with 16 GB (there is a 32 GB SSD --Solid State Drive-- version available) of drive storage and can be supplemented with Google Drive cloud storage (free) for additional storage. You can also slip in an SD card up to 64 GB for .PDF files, documents of all extensions, movies, pictures and music.As for entertainment, Youtube and Netflix is clear and never stutters. Watching movies one SD card on the matte-finish 11.5 \" screen is better than expected for such a low priced laptop. No complaints here.There's an HDMI out port and one USB 3.0 and one USB 2.0 port, headphone/mic input.At just 2.7 lbs, this laptop is not cumbersome and stays very cool even after hours of play. I am writing this document on it and I feel quite comfortable doing it. I can't say that about any laptop I've used in the past. I've seen the best of laptops come my way for repair, and not once was I enthralled by the keyboard.  I love this keyboard!When you are not connected to the internet, you can still enjoy your Chromebook to some extent.  You can still write documents, read and write email (for sending later), play one of many free games, read a book or just settle in for a good old movie.  It isn't as crippled as Microsoft's damning commercial makes it out to be, is it?The question now, is: Is this for you? If you aren't a lover of Google's self-contained system and are really dependent on specialized programs, then you probably won't find much to like about it. But if you are all things Google and have no need for heavy, specialized programs like Photoshop, or intensive music production software, heavy 3-D gaming and the total Microsoft Office experience, welcome to the next thing in computing!By Eddie T", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Chromebook", "Author": "ChesterHartman", "ReviewID": "R2LAL7C6A8HM4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For $199 the computer is a miracle.

The start up time with the solid state drive and Chrome OS is sensational.  I used to be apprehensive to use a computer for any quick, menial tasks, but now I just reach from my Acer.  There are some items that take some getting use to.I have run into issues with Citrix because my company doesn't have the latest and greatest that comes with the HTML5 version.  The Chrome OS seems to lack some basic settings that I would like to be able to change.  For example, the Acer will turn on whenever you lift the screen.  It makes sense to do so, but it did take me some time to get used to it when I was just looking to clean the screen or keyboard.  And finally, as I am sure you know, the Chrome OS doesn't have the ability to install programs outside of the Chrome browser.  I knew this going in, but there have been a few times that I wish the OS could at least run very simple programs in an emulated environment.The Acer C720 looks stylish and isn't very flashy.

I was actually surprised to find a full-sized HDMI port that easily allows the computer to display on an external display like a monitor or HDTV.

For $199 at the time of my purchase, I could not be happier with what I got for my money. This 11.6\" laptop is great on battery life, has stellar performance, and houses a sleek and portable form factor. Chrome OS is limited to some, but with a constant internet connection and a computer at home that you can remote desktop to (not entirely necessary), there isn't much you can't do with a Chromebook. The dual-core Intel Celeron (Haswell) CPU inside isn't power hungry, it doesn't put out much heat at all, and it powers Chrome OS like a boss. The C720 also carries 2GBs of RAM, which is plenty for most of what you'll be doing inside of Chrome. You won't have any stuttering or lag with multiple tabs open in Chrome, a video playing or music in the background while blogging on social media. At the time of this review I currently have 6 tabs open, including a livestream on Twitch.tv, and there is no lag whatsoever. Battery life is also fantastic. With social media, email, music, and word processing, you can expect anywhere from 7 - 9 hours with the C720, slightly less if constantly streaming video. I had a day where I unplugged the laptop at 7am, used it for notes and videos through school till around noon, then used it all day at work researching tech and playing videos; I ended the day at 10pm with around 49% battery, I then proceeded to use the laptop most of the next day at home before it finally dying around 3pm. So you can expect to get through a whole day with this Chromebook. Another additional benefit is USB 3.0. There is 1 on this laptop, as well as a single USB 2.0 port on the other side of the laptop. You also have full HDMI out for running an extra HDMI enabled monitor/tv. This greatly improves functionality if you enjoy having multiple displays. It's lightweight, portable, looks great and the build quality is superb for a sub $200 laptop, but there are a couple downsides. The original carried a full-size SD card slot (when inserted, the card would be flush with the laptop, making portable storage easy), the C720 lacks this, and only carries a half-depth SD card slot, minor downside. Also, there are no function keys as well as no caps lock key, like the original. I would like to be able to ALT-F4 out of Chrome, instead I have to CTRL-W to close each tab/window individually. The screen is 11.6\" and has a resolution of 1333x768, which is just fine for a 11\" laptop. Viewing angles and color reproduction wasn't the best, but you won't have many complaints sitting in front of the laptop for a few hours. Another downfall out of the box was the keyboard, the keys were shallow but well spaced. After a couple days of use I got completely used to this and am now typing this review on the C720 at 60+ WPM.To conclude, if you're on a budget looking for a laptop, already live inside of Google's ecosystem or are okay with living in the cloud (no classic Windows applications/limited storage), then this laptop will serve you well.The C720 has the best battery life for a Chromebook on the market, other than Dell's Chromebook 11 ($100 more than the C720 at the time of this review),which only carries a couple hours of battery life over the Acer here. Other than that, you won't find better performance, battery life and a simple, utilitarian design in any other sub $200 laptop.Pros:PerformanceBattery lifePortabilityLoud speakersGood trackpad with easy-to-use gesturesCons:Screen viewing angles and colorsLack of caps lock key and F4 key.

Intuitive trackpad gestures make mouse interactions work almost as well as a real mouse.The only real knock I can find against it is the display.  Good viewing angles are really tight, and just a few degrees up or down will wash all of the colors out.If you're a power user, you can partition the drive in half, and dual-boot ChromeOS and Linux for a complete laptop experience without the Windows tax.

But really, I was perturbed with Microsoft for abruptly pulling the plug on XP. Suddenly I was expected to replace my laptop and the software on it - an expense of at least $1500 to $2000. And why? Because Microsoft got lazy? Windows 8 is horrible. I surely don't want to replace XP with that! So I decided to try a less expensive solution, if only for fun. And Wow! What an improvement! all for $250 (I bought the 32 GB version and a carrying case).At first I was a little less than enthused because after all - the Chromebook is just a glorified browser, right? Wrong! I discovered it is very easy to install a full blown version of Ubuntu Linux with all the bells and whistles - and it doesn't upset the default version of the Chromebook at all. Take that Microsoft!Linux is free. Google software is free. Web storage is free. And the new Acer Chromebook is amazing! 10 seconds from stop to online! Can't beat that. And the battery life is amazing.

Why?  First of all, Chromebooks have been interesting to me for a long time, but I'm not an early adopter.  I tried an Android Transformer tablet/keyboard last summer and recently work gave us Windows 8 tablet/laptops. My profile is a tinkerer--and a cheap one at that.  I have a Roku and Chromecast, I mess around with XBMC, and I try to stretch all my tech dollars.  I wanted a simple, lightweight, mobile device with a keyboard--something handy for surfing on the couch, stashing it away in a backpack and riding the bike to my local coffee shop for some writing.  The other reviews and numerous Youtubes on this unit are consistently very good.  What finally snagged me was the XP laptop trade-in deal offered by a local retailer and suggested by an article on CNET, which enabled me to bring this home at half-price.Playing with it for a night and a morning (normal Chrome apps, Outlook.com (just to see if I could still use Microsoft stuff), and Chrome Desktop), I'm convinced of a couple of things:-$200 is totally the sweet spot for Chromebooks.  This thing can do a lot and does it very fast, but it can't do everything.  Everyone should know that by now.  That's not a \"con\" for me.  I know this going in.  But at this price, what it does is incredible.-Waiting for the new Samsung Series means saving up another $100-200.  The new hardware looks intriguing (I'm generally a Samsung fan) and I bet it's very nice, but at $349-399 for the new units I'm starting to think Windows (the Asus Transformer Book T100, for example).  By the way, Windows 8's schizo Desktop/Metro is starting to grow on me.-$1100 for the Macbook Air was a goal until I returned to my profile and use case.  If I want a beautiful piece of hardware that I'll try to use for the next five years without much change, then maybe this is it.  But I'm also not sure I want to stash it in my backpack and crash the bike or bump it around.  I'd baby it too much.So thanks to the XP trade in, some passion from Puppylinuxworld on youtube, and reflection on my use, I took the plunge.

This basically fits all my needs. When I announced I had bought a chromebook a few of my friends were disgusted. One said that \"all it does is run the internet\" and another said \"they break in no time\". To the second guy, I'm assuming he was talking about earlier chromebooks which I heard broke very easily. Everything I heard about this one before buying it said that it was much sturdier and did not break easily. To the first guy, I said well, that's all I really need.I really needed a new laptop and as a high school student my priority was speed, lightweight, thinness, efficiency, and for it to look nice. So I started looking into chromebooks and decided that this pretty much met those needs. I'm not really a hardcore gamer, and if I really need to play computer games there's always other laptops in my home to use. I love google chrome and chrome applications for their simplicity and ease. This gave me all that without other distractions. No need to worry about antivirus, no constant update reminders, no snail-pace start up, no overheating. Just so convenient. Obviously there are drawbacks of not being able to do all that you might be able to do with a traditional laptop but I'm willing to look past that. With my high school/artist's budget I don't really expect to make much and so don't really expect to be getting some high tech piece of machinery that works to perfection.The only problem I personally face is that my WiFi connection can be pretty s***ty, but that's not the chromebook's fault. Really, if my WiFi was out while I was on my old laptop I would pretty much have nothing to do except wait for it to come back. So why waste 300 extra bucks on something over priced and over large that I won't even use when I could have this for a much better price? Another thing I had to get accustomed to was the small size. I was expecting something a bit larger and I felt a little disappointed initially when I saw it, but I got over it pretty fast. Now when I use my old laptop or another \"regular\" laptop, it feels ridiculously large and awkward.

After some frustrating experiences with the trackpad (and as I was going out of town for a week) I decided to revert to Chrome OS just to have something to browse the web with during my trip. For doing just that, the machine is great, and works nearly flawlessly. Long battery life, quick and responsive, and quiet and cool. However, those benefits are also its drawbacks. If you plan to do any serious work, life gets difficult quickly. It's simply not made for those purposes. I eventually fixed all the issues I had with my linux installation, but still use Chrome sometimes. With linux the machine is great, and works just as a small laptop would.Chrome OS is the real limitation here, but for what many internet users do, I think this device is more than capable of meeting expectations.

Though the machine is thin and light, Mostly plastic casing makes the computer feel more like a toy than nicer laptops. In addition, the screen has poor viewing angles and the color is lackluster. Trackpad is small and lacks well defined button areas, sort of an attempt to recreate the apple trackpad gone wrong. I find myself tapping by not pressing down, but tapping on the trackpad, which I've never done until now. Due to the smallness of the laptop as a whole, the keyboard is not the standard size and lacks some of the more conventional keys (such as the delete key, which is more frustrating than you'd think).

I bought this for my dad since he's a senior and the old Windows Vista is getting to be a real pain for him to work with. I originally purchased a Samsung Chromebook (when it was first introduced) for him but found out the printing mechanism wasn't quite there. So I've been using this Acer Chromebook tonight and it's simply a joy to use!My setup with the unit is paired with my Google CloudPrint enabled printer, Epson WorkForce 845. Set up was easy enough. Since this unit is for my dad, I'm going to get him a low-end Epson Expression XP-410. It's only $69 on Amazon and it's a steal! One thing my dad does with his current printer is using it to scan documents and feed directly to his email. I don't think the Epson does it automatically but as a workaround, he could scan the doc onto a SD card or thumb drive, then un-mount it and stick it in the Chromebook. Not as direct but the process is quite straight forward. It shouldn't be a problem for him, albeit he's 83. :-) Go dad!!I also tested the VPN connection and it works flawlessly. I have a VPN service so I could watch BBC programs via the iPlayer. Previously I've been using my Nexus 7 and hooking that up to my TV via a SlimPort connection. It's a bit of a pain but using the Chromebook, the process is much more reliable. Bluetooth works as expected. I'm very happy with how far Chromebook has come, therefore I'll be getting my own unit next week! I was planning on getting the 32GB unit but decided not to since I ordered a 64GB SSD replacement. It's only $50+ and I think it's worth it. Was thinking about the 128GB but since I'll be utilizing Google Drive (with a free 100GB for 2 years); I think 64GB is plenty; at least for now.What needs to improve? Not so much the hardware but I wish the OS has the ability to save web pages on the Shelf, or in a folder or some sort. There's a workaround on doing that but the process isn't as simple. Certain keys are missing from a traditional keyboard standpoint, but I'll adjust. If you miss your Function Keys, there's a way that you can set up your keyboard to toggle them back. It feels a bit 'odd' not being able to save anything on the 'desktop'. It's different and I think I'm going to like it, a lot!Thanks for reading.UPDATE: I just read about where the Epson Connect website has an option where you could scan directly to your Google Drive.

It's not loud, it's just annoying when it keeps turning on and off.Things I am ambivalent towards and simply have to get used to:-I have turned this thing on like once since I got it because it turns itself on/wakes itself up every time you open the lid if it possibly can. That includes the very first time you plug it in which startled me a little.-there's not much available in terms of customization/options for stuff like when it sleeps/turns off the monitor, but there's not much I've felt the need to change in the first place-the keyboard labels are in all lowercase-I can't use the NotScripts chrome extension because I can't get into the program files to set the password, but seeing as the Chrome OS is supposed to be nearly immune to viruses I probably don't need to worry-there are no function keys, but the only ones I used were for refreshing and fullscreen, and there are keys for those-the caps lock key was replaced with a \"Search\" key but one of the customization options they do give you is the ability to change it back to a caps lock key so naturally I switched it right back-when I press the keys, they don't go down very far so I kept feeling like the keystroke couldn't possibly have registered properlyIf you spend a lot of time online and/or writing, a Chromebook is probably right for you.If you're into gaming, digital art, etc., you're better off getting a more conventional computer.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great all doer", "Author": "Emmanuel V.", "ReviewID": "R2L4YHPAX187KG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast, fluid, great battery life and hassle free updates.

So I wanted a small, light laptop that would allow me to surf the web while getting the benefits of a laptop vs tablet (touch type and precision pointer/click control).  This Chromebook fits all of my needs easily.  I get over 7 hours on a single charge (though unfortunately my battery level and charge-time indicators are somewhat inaccurate), and web pages load very quickly even on a 802.11-g router that's connected to slowish DSL.  I plugged a USB headset into this and was able to use it to do a Google video call in combination with the built-in 720p webcam with no driver install process or setup issues at all.  I use this at home, work, and the homes of family members, and it seamlessly transitions between wifi access points.  I did encounter one issue that only ever happened on an AT&T; DSL connection where images and pages sometimes were timing out or not loading, seemingly due to DNS issues, as though the browser were giving up too quickly to resolve and/or load, but hard-setting DNS to always use Google's servers seems to have fixed that issue.  Which brings up a good point:  for those willing to use Google and do some tinkering, even without installing Linux there are lots of settings and tools you can use to get a bit more functionality and customization than what the standard ChromeOS interface provides.Two issues worth mentioning:  any SD card will stick about half-way out of the card slot, which is unfortunate.  After extensive searching, it seems that there is no current micro-SD to full-size SD adapter that will fit completely within the slot, either.  The screen is also somewhat low-end:  while the resolution has not yet been a problem at all, the viewing angles and blue-haze common to low-end LCD panels are both very apparent here.  I sometimes find myself tilting the screen to odd angles in an attempt to mitigate the viewing-angle problem, but it's a minor inconvenience overall.  Watching 720p/HD streaming shows/movies is entirely possible thanks to the decent CPU/GPU, but the picture quality, especially in darkish scenes, will suffer on this screen.

It all makes me laugh.  What do people expect for $199?  I expected a lot less than I got.  The C720 is lightening fast, powers up immediately, and is child's play to use.  It even found my iPhone hot spot without a hitch, so I can take the laptop anywhere there isn't a dedicated Wi-Fi signal.  Amazingly, I plugged in my wireless Microsoft Mouse and it worked immediately.  This laptop is a wonder of simplicity, speed, and portability.  It's light yet sturdy enough to last.  Most of what I do is Chrome based to begin with, so this is perfect for me.  Word documents I've moved to Google Drive or open in my email are perfectly readable.  Same with PDF files.  I have a new desktop for Microsoft intensive tasks, an iPhone and iPad for causal use, and now the C720 for intermediate work.  I bought this to replace my two outdated XP Dell machines--and I couldn't be happier.  I especially like the no worries anti-virus controls built into the background of the C720.  If I lose this, I won't be happy but I won't be out all that much money.  It's almost a disposable laptop--and a fine one at that.  For a Chromebook this simply can't be beat.  Buy one.

Temple", "ReviewID": "R1PMN4Q1WT37GW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I want to give 5 stars, but for now I cannot.  I purchased the C720 on 2/8/14 and within the first 48 hours I experienced a few \"crashes.\"  I chalked them up as crashes and within the first week focused on finding a bad Chrome extension.  I eventually disabled all extensions but the issue still persisted.  About once a day I would experience a \"crash.\"The next step was to contact a Chrome Ninja who did some troubleshooting with me and eventually had me do a powerwash.  After trying this and sending some system data they indicated my Chromebook had been put in developer mode and that they could not help me.  This was interesting because a) it was a new Chromebook and b) while I know what developer mode is I certainly did not perform the steps at any time to enter into developer mode.  After explaining this to the Chrome Ninja he reviewed the information I sent again and said the Chromebook was no longer in developer mode but had been put in dev mode at some point in the past.  Given that, he said the only way for him to continue to assist was for me to do a full recovery of the machine.  No big deal, I made my USB recovery disk and completed the task and started over.After performing the recovery, the machine was still randomly \"crashing\" 1-2 times per day.  After the Chrome Ninja reviewed the latest system info he replied back and said I have a power issue and that I'd need to contact Acer for support/repair.  What I ignorantly wasn't realizing is that the Chromebook wasn't necessarily crashing, it was completely shutting down.  I should have realized that given that I had to press the power button each time it happened for the Chromebook to boot back up, but I just wasn't putting it together I guess since this is my first Chromebook.Now that I realized what was happening (thank you Chrome Ninja), I contacted Acer for repair since I had unfortunately purchased the Chromebook from Best Buy and I was past my 14 day return window.  At first, Acer wanted me to pay for shipping to their facility in Texas.  While I was annoyed they would even think I would pay for shipping (I told them the Chromebook was brand new and less than 30 days old) it was admittedly not that hard to get them to pay for the shipping.  I simply asked the Acer support representative and it took him about 5 minutes to confirm a free shipping label would be approved.  After a brief hold, he came back and said he was emailing me a shipping label.So, that's pretty much where I stand.  I have shipped my brand new Chromebook that I've used maybe a dozen times off to Acer for repair.  While I consider myself an understanding person, I'm quite disappointed that I'm now without my device for a period of time.  I can only hope that they actually repair it correctly and that the issue does not occur again.  Given the random nature of the issue, I'm skeptical at best.  I am hopeful though given the fact that there are so many positive reviews for this device I have to be an anomaly.I will update my review and rating once I get the device back from Acer.  If anyone else experiences a new machine that just randomly shuts down, don't wait until the return period is over... just swap it out for a new one immediately!UPDATE: 4/15/2014-----------------My Chromebook has been in repair with Acer twice now.  The first time, regarding the power issue above, they simply \"Reloaded OS\" and sent it back.  I had told them, more than once, that I had already done that and it didn't help.  After receiving the Chromebook back in late March, I began to experience the same issue of the Chromebook just randomly powering off on the very day that I received it back from repair.  So, I immediately called Acer support and they immediately, without trouble, sent me a shipping label (again) to send it back for repair (again).  After just 1 day of having the Chromebook back in my possession, I turned around and shipped it off again.I received the Chromebook back today, 4/15, with a note reading, \"Unable to replicate symptoms of the unit shutting down.  Unit remained powered on while streaming videos from youtube for more than 24 hours.  No trouble found.\"  Fair enough, but at this point I'm just waiting for the issue to happen again, at which time I will send it in... again.  Luckily, Google has been very helpful and they are helping me figure out what the issue is.  I just have to wait for it to happen again and they're going to analyze the data I send them from a feedback report.I'm trying to remain patient as I know my issue is difficult to replicate and is very random, but I would love to be able to talk to a more technical person at Acer to explain my issue as I believe things are getting \"lost in translation...\"  The other issue is I'm thinking it's battery related, and I would be the Acer tech left the Chromebook plugged in, and I've only experienced the issue while on battery power.Given the above... I've updated my rating to 2 stars.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Easiest computer I've ever used!", "Author": "Eileen M.

I really cannot state how great the battery is:  I literally went through almost 2 full days of use with this on a single charge (not continuous use, but off and on for hours at a time for the entire two days).I also earned 100 GB of free Google space - bringing my total Google Cloud space up to 130 GB (all for free).I've been speed-testing the WiFi.  The machine achieves excellent speeds (same as my desktop PC).  This may be standard nowadays, but my cell phone and other laptops I've tried often have a slightly inferior WiFi connection.  So I'm happy to report that this thing achieves full speeds over WiFi (and really connects almost instantly to it).There are a few things I dislike, but it's not with the machine itself.  Google Docs is missing a few features that I would have assumed standard (e.g., no ability to use a section break).Also, I really like Google Chrome Remote Desktop, but there is one issue with the screen flickering when I try to stream StarCraft 2 on my chromebook.  I'm not sure what the reason is, but it may have to do with my desktop PC having two monitors (dual screen).  Not quite sure yet.  Otherwise, Google Chrome Remote Desktop is brilliant!One thing I noticed:  If you have multiple email accounts with Google, you'll need to create a separate user to access them.  It's not a bad thing, but it is a necessity.Another thing:  There is no \"delete\" key on this keyboard.  That may be standard on laptops, but I used that key all the time on my desktop PC (and I miss it!).In sum, I'm still very glad I purchased this Chromebook.  People try to ding things by saying the screen is of poor quality, or that the keyboard is bad, etc.  I DO NOT agree.  The screen looks great to me, and the only thing I can say about the keyboard is that it's a little smaller than a full-sized keyboard (standalone).  But I can type on it just fine (as I'm doing now).All in all, a terrific machine at a terrific price!  Still 5/5 for me!I'm getting ready to travel across the country for approximately 2 weeks.  I will post another update on my experience using it on the go.  Cheers!**Update #2**I'm on holiday and recently flew from Ohio to California with a connection in Texas (American Airlines flights).  GoGo in flight WiFi worked and it was FREE!A few things:*It only worked from Texas to California (no service from Ohio to Texas)*The overall speed was very hit or miss.  One second web pages / music would be loading decently, and then it would come to a grinding halt.  This was, admittedly, rather annoying.*When I had no connection, I noticed that I could still make changes to files I had stored in Google Docs.  For some reason, these files would still open even though I had no internet connection.  I'm very baffled by this, but it's an incredible plus.  Basically, all the changes I made were synced once the connection resumed.  This is an AWESOME feature because it allows me to work despite the lack of an active connection.Other general thoughts:*The speed of this chromebook is incredible.  A particularly nice feature is the boot-up time.  If you open the chromebook, it resumes instantly.*Again, I have to comment on the wicked good battery life.  I cannot remember the last time I charged this device, but I can tell you it was BEFORE I left for vacation, which translates to about 5-7 days.  This is with full time usage during my flight (several hours) and also moderate usage before and after the flight.  As of right now, after about a week of light / moderate use, I've got 22% battery life / about 2 hours left.  WICKED GOOD BATTERY LIFE!*A pleasure to travel with due to its slim and lightweight design.I was hoping I'd be getting some more work in during my trip, but we all know how that goes.  I will post another update again in the future.Still 5/5.**Update #3**I've had a few more thoughts since my purchase.  First off, still love this machine in pretty much every possible way.A minor downside, at the moment, is Google Chrome Remote Desktop.  First off, the app works great FOR THE MOST PART.  However, certain tasks / applications ARE SLOW.  The trouble is that I have not figured out a way to fix this issue.  I'm not sure if it's a hardware issue, a software issue, or a bandwidth issue.  I've tried reducing my color depth and eliminated all visual enhancements on the Win 7 machine, but it hasn't fixed the issue.I dug around and it turns out that Google seems to be aware of this issue, suggesting that I'm not the only one experiencing this and also that they are currently working to resolve the performance degradation during Chrome Remote Desktop.The best way I can describe the performance issues is this:  Laggy.  The cursor will sometimes lag behind, typing will sometimes be delayed, and applications will stutter a bit.  It seems to get worse depending on where I am using my chromebook, which makes me suspect that it might be a bandwidth issue.  Of course, I'm not 100% sure and it may be a combination of things.  I do hope that they resolve the issue sometime soon!Otherwise, nothing majorly new to report at this time.  It's still a workhorse bargain of a machine as I outlined in my previous reviews, and it's most certainly still one of the best electronics / laptop purchases I've ever made (if not THE best computer purchasing decision I've ever made!).**Update #4**Quick tip:  To avoid the loud mouse click when using the trackpad, push down slightly above the left mouse key.  The button will not depress, and thus will not make noise; yet, if you find the sweet spot, you can successfully click the mouse!  :)I also wanted to say that my GoGo WiFi was much better on my return flights (previously, it was kinda slow and in one leg not even available).Also, Google Chrome Remote is great in terms of reliability, but needs to be updated for better speed.  Also, when using Chrome Remote in full screen mode, a really annoying display box telling you you're in full screen mode pops up whenever you hover your mouse near the top of the screen.  This is really ANNOYING and should be eliminated!", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "I. LOVE. THIS.

After meticulously comparing all the Chromebooks within my price-range on the market and testing them out in person at Best Buy, I decided on this one. I am SO glad I did! I currently have a Dell Desktop computer, and an HP laptop. This is perfect for sticking in your bag on the go, taking with you on vacation, the coffee shop, school, WHEREVER. It's even more convenient to take to bed or on the couch because it's so freaking light as a feather! It doesn't heat up or make any noise. The display is great (no glare), plays HD YouTube fairly well (THE BUFFERING AND LOADING TIME IS INCREDIBLE IT\"S SO FAST), and has pretty loud sound considering the size.Not only that, but it's super thin, and the battery life is mind-blowing. It just lasts forever. And I know several people on the internet complain about its processing power, but I don't see the issue. I have had TONS of tabs open at once with no problem. The only thing that gave me a bit of trouble in that area was a ton of tabs + trying to play Spotify (it had a bit of difficulty buffering).All-Google interface takes a few days to get used to, but once you do, it's so easy.Don't forget that this is a Chromebook though, and you cannot really download any software or programs. But you get what you pay for, and lemme tell ya, it's a total bang for your buck. Really can't go wrong with one of these.

The basic configuration Chromebook C720 with 2Gb RAM and 16 GB SSD can run fast-action 720p HD video (example: Youtube video of squash or badminton sports), even in full-screen mode, without any performance issue.

I also occasionally surf the web and maybe once in a while do a video chat/Skype.With those requirements in mind, I wanted to get the cheapest laptop I could find. I am not a big Windows 8 fan (my now-dead laptop was running Linux) and of course Macs are too expensive, so I started looking at Chromebooks. To be honest this was the cheapest one I could find with decent reviews, and at only $199 I thought I'd give it a try.I'm pretty impressed with ChromeOS as a whole. It boots very quickly, and this C720 has a good battery life (4 or 5 hours with youtube watching). The screen quality isn't the best but the resolution is acceptable. As you would expect, pretty much everything is based around Chrome and it all works pretty well.One thing that is a downside of ChromeOS and not this particular product is that since everything revolves around Chrome, any Chrome extensions you install have the opportunity to mess the system up pretty good. After a couple weeks of really poor performance after installing (and uninstalling) some extensions, I did a system restore (which was very easy/fast from the menu). After that, I just didn't install any extensions and it has been working great ever since.The device is really light and easy to carry around. It doesn't feel exceptionally sturdy..

I wouldn't recommend it to someone as an only computer or to someone who isn't comfortable occasionally googling around to figure out a problem.My biggest complaints are not reasons to avoid purchasing this Chromebook, but things I'd wish I'd known prior to my purchase. While the apps available through the Google Play store are overall very helpful, switching between non-Google file types can be tricky. Mostly for me that's dealing with Windows documents, such as .docx. I've also had some trouble with media files, especially video and sound, that I'm still trying to sort out. Streaming works well, but opening previously downloaded files is not so simple.The biggest criticism I've encountered in about a month of ownership is just how flimsy the hardware is. It's something a few reviews mentioned, but it didn't really jump out at me until I got my own. About two weeks after I bought my Chromebook, my medium-sized dog bumped it off the table and stepped on the (closed) Chromebook. It booted up and works absolutely fine, but the upper-left hand corner of the screen is a grey block and there's a weird green line running down the screen. I would definitely recommend buying the purchase protection plan for this laptop. I am filing a claim with my credit card in hopes it'll be covered.I might be slightly biased because my ASUS K50 is an absolute tank and has weathered a lot more damage in 6 years of ownership. It also weighs 6 times as much, which is why I upgraded to the Chromebook.Still, I like this machine a lot and I'd buy it again.

I still have my HP laptop but it's much, much slower (and older) but it's a completely different \"laptop\" than the Chromebook.You open lid of CB and it turns on within about 2 - 3 seconds.  No sound, no sign of a fan running, no glitches.  Just smooth as silk...  it seems like it's not really \"on\", it's that quiet!Fast.  Fun.  Keyboard is a little smaller than I'm used to, but it's big enough to very, very easily get used to, and to actually USE.Can't think of a thing I don't like about it - the price is great.  Has the HDMI port so I can simply hook my HDMI cable from CB to TV (both, obviously, have the HDMI ports, otherwise it wouldn't work!). So right now I've rid myself of NASTY Dish Network (I say this because they treat their employees like garbage, and I'm being generous with this comment...)  Yes, Dish has ok technology.  So do their competitors, plus if you have high-speed internet, you can access everything that way.  So forget about paying the outrageous fees for being able to watch a wide variety of shows & movies.  Use the internet - Hulu Plus, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. and pay a nominal monthly fee and watch shows/movies whenever you want.Love this Chromebook.  Very glad I finally purchased it.  It's very thin & sleek.  Lightweight.  And it's built very well - not flimsy, not cheap feeling.  It's sturdy and super light.

The whole computing experience is even better than the Android tablet.  Don't get me wrong - Android on my phone is wonderful but when it comes to a larger device, where I tend to do/expect a little more, this Chromebook more than surpasses expectations.Chromebooks offer a computing experience, in my opinion, that closely mirror what one is already familiar with in a traditional PC environment - operation of the hardware, software functionality and overall familiarity make for a small learning curve.  I really also like that you can work offline with it - to an extent.  I've used it only once offline and that was to continue working on a document - it was a success.The Acer C720 is overall well designed.  It is thin, lightweight and they keyboard is comfortable to use - especially those of us who are old-school typists :) .  The screen is fine enough - this is at basic hardware and thus you have to expect some areas to be cost cutting.  However, the whole package makes for a great experience.Google is only going to improve the Chrome OS and these devices are going to continue reaping the benefits of those improvements.  Matched to Acer's hardware design and low-cost, they have a hit.  I can see why Chromebooks are picking up in popularity - lightweight, fast, easy to use and reasonable price now brings computing closer to what people as me want.

I have been a Chromebook fan since the early days and find this a great entry level unit.Pros:-Great battery life (real world 6-7 hours)-Faster then Samsung or HP Arm Processor-Small and light-They improved on color and design slightly (less plasticy- more metal looking then 710, but still wish it was more premium)Cons--Screen (both in quality, and size). Now realize I might be a little biased on this one. I have a few of the Samsung Arm Chromebooks for the kids, and I own a Chromebook Pixel. I recently bought a Mac Air (to do more developer things), and had to return it because the screen just does not cut it for me (after using the Pixel). I got a Macbook Pro to find the screen to my liking. So if you are coming from any retina type screen, this will be harder to adjust to. Otherwise, what more can you ask for in a $199 notebook.-Design is still a little on cheap end, too large of bezel-Speakers have OK volume, but Bass is distorted at higher volumeSuggestions (not specifically for this model, but Chromebooks in general):-ACER (or Asus, Samsung, or Toshiba - you still have a chance to surprise us in early 2014), there IS a market for a little nicer unit. This is what I would change on this (and any lower end chromebook).1) The bezel is a little too large. Seems they could of pushed 12.1 or 12.6 out of same form factor by reducing bezel.2) Go IPS, HP 11 is a beautiful screen (too bad they couldn't of put a Haswell in that one).3) Love the Micro USB charger of the HP 11 (although not sure if that was part of recall of that model).4) Must be Haswell type power with 8+ hours of battery life5) Must be under 3 lbs.6) Sound through keyboard7) Backlit keyboard8) Metalish look please, and sturdy frame. Not a huge fan of the polished plastic look that HP went back to in the 11. Reminds me of the first series 3 Samsung I owned. Maybe even going leatherish feel with aluminum trim (like the first Nexus 7) gave off a professional look while keeping costs lower.While I understand almost 2 of every 3 units going out the door is for education, you would like to see one company step up to make a in-between model. For those of us that own the Pixel, we are disappointed in a battery that cannot perform past 3 hours making it almost useless in some cases.

The screen is not as bright as some of the others, but I believe that is due to the matte finish, which reduces reflections.  However, I found the keyboard to be unacceptable.  Just poor feel, short travel, and just didn't feel right.  To be more specific, I used an online typing test back to back on the Acer and Toshiba.  On the Toshiba, I scored 63 words per minute with 98% accuracy.  On the Acer, I scored 51 WPM with 85% accuracy.In the end I returned this for the chromebook by Toshiba.

I am actually writing this review on it. It is AWESOME. It's really light, and thin, so it can be stored easily. Two things I LOVE about it: the screen quality, and the sound quality. The sound is perfect. It's clear as crystal, and rivals the Dolby Digital 5.0 speakers on my Kindle Fire HD.  The Video quality is terrific, I always test that out by watching the Longmire season 2 trailer, and it was as clear as watching it on an HD TV. I'm only going to use this computer for writing, school work, music, and very little internet use (research, shopping, and the like).The screen is 11.6 inches, as the page shows, and, as I said, the screen resolution is Perfect (1366x768, 720 pixels). Now, for such a low price you may be thinking that this is a cheap piece of crap. It's not. It's a very firm little computer. There are two USB ports, and one USB 2.0 port. The computer has no Microsoft or Apple software, just for those of you who were wondering, it's all Google, which is perfect if you (like me) work with a Google account. It does have an Intel Celeron 4.1 GHz processor. The battery life of this computer is 8.5 hours, compared to the average 4 hours on other laptops. This says that the start-up speed is 7 seconds, but I swear, it's more like 3 seconds, and the same for shut-down speed. Now, there are two little blue lights, on the front of the computer: the one on the right is if it's charging, and the one on the left is if it's on. One other thing, you don't have to push any buttons for this to turn on. All you have to do is flip it open, and pow! the screen comes on. This is one nice little laptop.One thing I recently figured out is how to download things on to it, it has no major software, but it does the ability to download things, like picture or videos, or you can download the web address. You have to place the mouse on the picture, and tap the mousepad with two fingers, and you'll get the option to download it. You can upload those on to this computer, via jump-drive, so I do that as well. It also comes with this model's standard charging cord, being about 7-10 feet long. Now the space on these may not be so appealing to some: 16GB, or 32GB. One thing you can do, is buy a USB hub, and pug it in and use that as your storage. I have the 16GB, and I'm fine with that, because it gives me some restrictions.This is a great little computer, especially if you need it to do schoolwork. It's light, portable, has great sound and video qualities, great battery life, and a very good processor. I would definately recommend this to any one needing a small computer, or wanting a good one at a low price.

Frankly, I didn't feel anything wrong with the keyboard.However, the display was a little bit dim for my taste. So, I usually brought up the brightness. This was done easily with the brightness adjustment keys on the keyboard.

But even for us inbetweeners, this laptop does offer a few attractive features as well.These features are the same for all of us regardless of age; the tendencies that we as individuals have for blaming our human errors on the equipment we are using.  This laptop takes simple to a completely new level where if something gets screwed up you will know it was your fault regardless of age.The Chromium OS also takes away the confusion of choosing the feature set of laptops that many times scares those who do not understand them.  Not only is this laptop using a dated processor and very limited other hardware offerings, however due to the operating system the user is left to wait for the hardware to catch up.As Google is now offering a decent set of cloud \"Office\" replacements, the user will benefit greatly if they hop on the bandwagon because never again will you be cursing a Windows freeze or a kernel panic for losing the entire document you were typing before the computer screwed it up.  The continuous saving of work product is very embraceable because it doesn't require any additional steps and feels just normal.Now for what this computer cannot do yet: Networking!  If the chromium system would allow for easy networking of computers I can see a business embracing these as everything saved can be shared in a common cloud drive.  The lack of software however makes this an impossibility.It is what it is, and if you want an inexpensive computer and don't do much else than use it for e-mail, internet, and office-type applications this computer is worth a serious look.

It's light, it's sleek, and battery life is fantastic.  My only complaint about the machine is that it does not have a caps lock key.  I don't have to type in all caps very often but when I do, holding shift is a pain in the butt.  I don't see the logic behind removing the caps lock key, but I suppose someone got paid good money to come up with the idea...It is a shame that a nice machine is so limited by the castrated Chrome OS.Now, there are plenty of warnings regarding the fact that a chromebook uses online apps.  I understood that.  However, there is 16 GB free on the hard drive, so I figured that there must be offline apps in the chrome store.  I live in a rural area where internet access is spotty in many places, so if I wanted to edit a text or image file, I would be able to do so.  I also thought I would be able to store and listen to some music.  Not a lot, obviously, but some to keep me occupied if I was in an area where there was no wifi.  I was also hoping for some light, offline games.So I head over to the chrome store... and there isn't much.  The selection, even for online apps, is small.  When you install an online app, chrome simply puts a site-specific launcher in the menu.  The game section if the store is particularly heart-wrenching, because many of the games don't even work on light hardware such as this.  I knew something was suspicious when I saw apps that had complex, 3D graphics.  It's as if Chrome just puts links in the store without bothering to check if they even work.  Many games do not even exist anymore.  If you want games, you're stuck with cartoonish multiplayer games, such as you would find on Facebook.This would not be a huge problem in and of itself... except, Android is so much more functional.  I have a generic Android device that I spent $30 for on black Friday.  It has many offline apps, a USB keyboard that makes it feel like a netbook, and battery life is even longer.  It is also more customizable as far as appearance goes.  With Chrome OS, all you can really do is change the background.So, while this chromebook was cheap, I could have spent even less and gotten a much more functional device.  It's pretty sad.  I can't even use Tor on my chromebook, and with the recent scandals surrounding internet anonymity, I view this as a flaw.Now, all this being said, there are so pro's to the way ChromeOS functions.  Since everything is in the cloud, if the OS is damaged in any way, the Chrome recovery tool will fix everything up in a no time, and all your data will be safe in the cloud.My biggest feeling with ChromeOS... disappointment.  Google could have created a more traditional OS and swept Microsoft aside.  Linux is incredible and the open source community is vast, and many applications that compete with Microsoft apps already exist.Instead, all I got was a netbook that runs the Chrome browser.  That is literally all ChromeOS is, a glorified browser.It is possible to install Linux on a chromebook, but there are problems with the touchpad.  Furthermore, installing another OS entails entering developer mode, where a scary boot screen stating that the OS is damaged appears with every boot.  The screen advises you to press a certain key to repair the OS... which will wipe your entire Linux install.  With a single keystroke.  Not a big deal if you know what you are doing, but if some unsuspecting friend booted your machine and read the message, you can kiss your data goodbye.If you do most of your stuff online, ChromeOS is fine, if you like paying more for less.

And that is the end of the good news.Beyond the physical hardware itself I find nothing useful about the Chromebook design at all.  I did not expect the Chromebook to replace my full blown Windows or Linux PC's.  I did, however, expect to be able to do a few key activities.1.  I use gmail for business and personal email as do many people I know.  On a Windows machine I can look at both account easily by using 2 different browsers and being looged in to each gamil account in a different browser.  Chrome OS IS the browser so you log into the machine using your gmail account.  To Look at another gmail account your have to log out and log into the machine as a different user.  This got old after the first hour of use.2.  Let kids play games and browse with some limitations.  As far as gaming online goes this chrome OS appears to be useless.  When my kid is using this machine I am getting called to assist every 2 minutes because some plugin is required and is either not supported by chrome or has crashed.  Playing exact same online games on a Windows PC works fine 90% of the time.  On Chrome OS is works 10% of the time.3.  Remote desktop.  It does not work.  Period.  I am technically adept and must use VPN clients to access remote machines for my job every day.  Chrome simply does not support VPN.  I tried very hard to get this to work and will not devote my time to elaborate on details here.  Suffice to say Chrome's remote desktop is not an option for me and VPN does not work.I wanted this Chromebook concept to work for me and I tried hard to make it work.  Chromebook as a concept does not provide myself or my family with what we need.  My simple Android tablet provides more flexibility and options than Chromebook does for basic email and browsing.Regarding support:  there is none.  I called and was told as much by Acer.

The wireless MAC number for this device is not listed on the box or the device itself and the setup screen does not allow any exit to determine what the MAC number is (the Continue button is inactive even if 'No network' is selected).  So - the MAC number of the device cannot be determined so it cannot be put in the wireless access point MAC filter table to allow it to connect.  Chat with Acer tech support was useless - they offered suggestions that will not work to determine the MAC address until at least one connection has been made or using keystroke combinations including Function keys that do not exist on the device.In the end we went to our local library where there is wireless access but no MAC filtering.  Connection was instantaneous and at that point the network icon (lower right of screen) became visible and usable to determine the MAC address.  So then we could go  back home, feed that into the MAC filter table and we were golden at home, too.

It's like Google just through together programs just for the sake of competing. Well they've got a lot of work to do.  I've used Google Docs and it just doesn't have the capabilities of \"Word\" or \"Open Office\". I know it's supposed to be a benefit not to have to \"SAVE\" a document, but sometimes I go into a program and back out but it stays on my list as a \"untitled doc or presentation\". The Google app that replaces SKYPE is functionally flawed.  It would take several pages of notes to enumerate all the bugs in \"DOCS\", \"Presenter\", and \"Spreadsheet\" programs. The overall functionality of the ACER is great, with the exception of the lack of a \"DELETE\" Key.  I love the solid state drive which makes computing quick and easy.

One day when I turned my computer on the screen had lines going all through it, and now its only gotten worse. Along the edges there is big black blobs where its just missing, and it is also \"staticy\" in places. It does have a year long warranty on it, but when I called I could not get a hold of any one that could speak proper English, and I was too frustrated to care any more. I decided to give it to my little brother who would only use it for YouTube, and I am buying myself a Surface Tablet.
