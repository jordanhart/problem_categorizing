I didn't get it from Amazon but the store I bought it from doesn't give you the option to leave a review. My Lenovo was an AMD A10 with much more ram but this Asus is so much faster! I even downloaded MapleStory just to see how long it would take to download, install, load and play and it actually downloaded pretty quick. Of course installing takes quite awhile but still faster than Lenovo. When I tried to install on the Lenovo, it kept failing midway. Loading took a couple of minutes, where the Lenovo took over 20 minutes. Also, the game plays much better on the Asus. The Lenovo was constantly lagging! The A10 is supposed to be the equivalent of I7 but it runs worse than I3. So if you're going to get a laptop, get this one! Asus is known for a really good and reliable motherboard. The failure statistics are much lower than almost every other company. Lenovo is right there with HP and Dell. I haven't had mine long but have used it constantly since I got it and I have not had any issues with it. Also, ASUS gives you 1 year accidental warranty.I'm using this for personal, school and business use so this definitely fits the bill and was on sale at my local Fry's.Just remember, don't go for AMD! Intel is definitely the way to go!", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Keyboard issues from start and downhill from there.....", "Author": "CAD", "ReviewID": "R3R4GJNM9IYC10", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For 25 yrs. or so, my husband and I have only owned Dell and Toshibas for ourselves and Macs for our now-adult kids.  We've had high satisfaction across the board yet saw this sleek-looking, light weight Asus in Best Buys (Windows 8) on sale for $529 and decided to try something new.  Two reps assured us its performance was as good as, if not better than, any Dell laptop.  (We're both self-employed and use all-in-one desktops at work.)The first problem noticed was that 4 of the function keys including all related to volume did not work.  We had all the  appropriate updates and double protection (anti-virus et al) yet these keys were useless.  Second, within the 1st month of use,  some of the letters and numbers we typed, whether e-mail on in Microsoft Word began appearing in random places on the screen. This problem was minimized by typing VERY slowly and we also found advice on the Asus technical site that helped somewhat.The third problem occurred in the 2nd month of use and now --  we're both busy professionals -- our sleek-looking new Asus sits waiting til one of us has time to bring it to an Asus technician.  Simultaneously, words we typed would self delete and the computer would simply shut down. There was no rhyme or reason to the timing and at the point we lost a document we'd been working on (and saving) 3 hours, we retired the Asus to a closet shelf.We've since bought a 15\" Dell Inspiron (also with Windows 8, which neither of us care for) in the same $ category --actually $20 less, with free protection as a bonus-- and for 3 months, its performance has been flawless. Our advice:  everyone has individual preferences and we're not suggesting Dells, Toshibas or Macs are for everyone but unless you're offered a free 2 month trial --- avoid Asus laptops!", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B83EWNY"}}
