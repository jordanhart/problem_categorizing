{"Reviews": [{"Title": "If you're wondering this is the laptop you should buy.", "Author": "IrishNinja", "ReviewID": "RSB1A398WOUX6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about computers. I built the PC that I have and know a good bit about software and applications. I say this only so if you're reading this you know I'm not ignorant and don't pick at things that don't even really matter (as some tend to do). Before I decided to buy this particular laptop I did some pretty extensive research. The PC that I have is capable of hardcore gaming so I didn't need anything excessive. I did want a respectable machine however, and when I came across this one for the price it had everything I was looking for and MORE.The main pros are that this is a very well built and sleek looking machine. Just by handling it out of the box you know it was built with quality parts. The black design almost looks like a charcoal and it is a high gloss finish with raised lines that prevent fingerprints (love that). The time it took to start up was a little longer but once I removed a ton of bloatware from it it boots up quickly. The backlit keyboard is awesome to have because I do a lot of computing in front of the TV at night. Nice to not worry about having a light on. The keyboard also have a numeric keypad which I will use quite often, and it does this without cramping the regular keyboard. The mouse pad is sensitive to your palms rubbing against it while typing but Toshiba remedies this by having a mousepad lock button just above it. The speakers are of decent quality for this laptop. It cracks me up how people are so disappointed with laptop speakers. You're buying a LAPTOP, it's not supposed to be a home theater. Although the screen on this is AWESOME. I download a lot of video in high def and they look amazing on this. Finally, having the extra USB 3.0 port is great. I have terabytes worth of video and music and I can transfer it between machines quickly and efficiently. I didn't mention any of the specs because I'm sure you read them and if you know anything about computers this is a pretty high powered laptop for the price.The only con I have so far is the battery life. Although it does have an eco-utility the battery still only last a little over 3 1/2 hours if your busy on it (I multitask a lot). Toshiba does have different batteries you can buy, however if you're willing to spend a little extra.In conclusion, I am VERY happy with my decision to buy this laptop. Oh and BTW it came with a free Xbox 360. How can you beat that?! It is well worth the money and I plan on having this machine for quite a few years.", "Date": "July 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am happy with this purchase!", "Author": "Calvin Sawyer", "ReviewID": "R2GUW60PNWRZ1E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop because of the fact that it had an LED backlit keyboard and a lovely 6gb memory (even though I could've replaced it myself). The only bad part was the fact that this laptop only had the Core i3, but because I'm not a gamer it was a sacrifice I was willing to make. I only wished the i5 version of this laptop had the LED backlit keyboard, but there were none available for this price range. But overall I love this laptop. It still operates smoothly so far on my 5th day of using it.

Well, my desktop crashed and this became my only computer, and that is when I realize that the space bar doesn't space about 4 times out of ten.This makes using this computer about useless for any work related activities.Also the FN key and space bar do not light up.

Love the backlit keyboard.", "Author": "LightGuy48", "ReviewID": "R1P6ZQJ3A4RF3T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a laptop to replace my old Dell Inspiron 6000.  I do a lot of work in low light conditions and I found this was a great choice with the backlit keyboard. I also like have the numeric keypad as well!  The widescreen has great colors and the brightness has a great range of control.Now a few negatives. I DO NOT like the SD card slot on the front of the computer, it has somewhat rough edges to it and it is annoying when you hands/wrists rub against it.  The glossy screen can show a lot of glare/reflection in certain conditions and the screen sits on the keys when the cover is closed which allows finger oil to transfer to the screen surface.Overall I'm happy with the purchase and would buy it again.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, so good!", "Author": "Dani", "ReviewID": "R33RMCGS0CEWAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "shipping was fast.Computer is very light.Keypad light is excellent.The touch pad at the top is very sensitive, so turn the computer off to clean the keyboard.Speakers are wonderful.you can turn the keyboard light off and onthe windows key and 'p' for projector option is very nifty for those of us who watch movies with their computers.
