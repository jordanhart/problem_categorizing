{"Reviews": [{"Title": "M17 vs Sony VAIO 16.4", "Author": "Timothy S. Smith \"dynatim\"", "ReviewID": "R8WNVU8Q7H41", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After being a SONY VAIO user for a few years I was very anxious to put the Alienware laptop to the test. Although I am not much of a gamer these days I DO multi-task to a ridiculous degree. I often have 3 browsers open with dozens of tabs as well as running web authoring software, Photo shop and other utilities. At the time of ordering my laptop from Amazon I also ordered a 4 GB RAM stick to even out the odd 6 GB included with the M17. 8 GB appears to be sufficient to my needs. My first impression was overwhelming. There is no denying this laptop was built to impress. Every one that gazes on this laptop has had nothing less than Awe to express. One friend said it reminded him of a stealth fighter. All the lighting and matte black case is really attractive. I love the slot loading opti drive, even though just like the SONY it is on the right side, totally bumping in to my trackball every time I eject a disc. But better than SONY it does provide plenty of USB ports, 5 over the 2 supplied by SONY. Most import there are ports on both sides. The SONY had 2 right next to the disk drive again being totally in the way of any mouse or trackball.....??Now for actual use: I have been using it for a few weeks now. First off like another review indicates there was (ZERO) software, free or trial that had to be uninstalled like EVERY other laptop I have ever dealt with. That was VERY nice. I did not know at time of purchase that this unit had (2) hard drives running in a Raid O. Interesting. The access to the drives and Memory is very easy from the bottom unlike a lot of other laptops. It appears the multiple cooling fans are easy to get to and clean when required.Even with the dual Raid O hard drive THIS laptop appears to boot up a bit slower than the VAIO. I think this has something to do with the Alienware face recognition and other ALienware related esthetics. I am sure this can be all uninstalled or deactivated. Not a huge deal at the moment but I thought I should mention it. Face recognition is very annoying until it gets to know you. Still may be quicker to just type in your password. A very unique feature any way you look at it.(no pun intended) There has been no issues installing any of my drivers to external devices I use.This will be my short list of complaints:- The SONY has a better screen. no doubt. Plus a blueray player.- Matte Black looks really cool as long as you keep it clean. It seems to attract dust like a magnet and it shows bad.- The actual height of the keyboard is about an inch higher than what I am used to so I had to readjust my office chair to type comfortably.- After the newness of the pretty lights begins to become normal one might wonder if they may be an issue in the future. Also the machine has more of a kids look (not sure it would fit in to an office environment). I do miss the thin elegance of the SONY. This is a VERY heavy laptop. Even though I never take my big laptop with me anywhere (I have a netbook for that) this laptop is VERY bulky and appears to weigh twice that of the SONY.- I think if SONY would have offered some of the features found on the M17 I would be still using the SONY at 2/3s the price.Bottom line: If you can afford this expensive laptop. Give it a try. Buying from Amazon I had it on my door step the day after ordering it.....NICE!!! Amazon return policy: THE BEST!!! I don't think I would have tried this laptop if Amazon did not offer it.I hope this helps potential M17 customers make a decision.", "Date": "May 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "This unit does come equipped with (2) 5870M's in Xrossfire.", "Author": "skygunner27", "ReviewID": "R13HI4LDKTMNOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This unit is amazing.

This retails on Dell's website same specs for $2,400 less shipping. I740QM fully upgradeable as well as the whole laptop is upgradeable. However where does this need upgrading maybe the processor? I mean c'mon dual GPU's both being the high end ATI 5870's. No computer at this price point to include the ASUS G73JW A1 can compete with this beast.. Awesome computer with awesome potential. Also the M17X doesn't come loaded with bloatware like ASUS. I was an ASUS G73JH owner, still have it and yet it took a lot of time cleaning up the factory sent laptop from ASUS. I ordered this with beast with next day shipping and it arrived just as advertised. Awesome computer so far.. You can't beat the price for these specs and the Alienware brand name.", "Date": "February 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a M17XR2 W Dual 5870's", "Author": "A-Train", "ReviewID": "R1214JSD887GGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "And it has dual 5870's in it.

I'm trying to get a few more months of use out of it before I take a hammer to it and then set it on fire.I'm not very tech savvy and I'm not a gamer but I spend a lot of time online. I wanted the fastest laptop available for that simple task so I ordered the Cadillac version of the M17x which set me back nearly $4,000. For that much money, the thing should perform flawlessly even if you drop it off a cliff.Since I've owned this POS, I've gone through three power cords, spent approximately 30 hours on the phone with Dell \"support\", had three different service visits to replace the motherboard and other components.Despite all that, the M17x overheats causing random shutdowns every hour or two. Two or three times a day the screen will just go blank and I'll have to do a forced shutdown and restart. It's ridiculous.You would be wise to not chalk my experience up to getting a random lemon. Too many others here and elsewhere have had the same or similar experiences.The bottom line is that Dell/Alienware are putting out outrageously overpriced pieces of junk. If you buy one, there is an excellent chance you'll hate yourself for it.My actual rating is negative 5 stars.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great stats, mediocre dependability", "Author": "Shane Robinson", "ReviewID": "R36168OGTSQ6GF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Others have shown that this laptop ships with a huge under-powered AC cable. Has trouble playing high quality movies on battery.Have experienced several catastrophic crashes (neon colored lines and blocks on screen, simply shut off without warning and wouldn't start without removing battery, etc).When it works, it works great.AlienFX (keyboard lights etc) continue to be glitchy with this model, as others.Built-in touchpad is horrible, non-responsive and over-sensitive. I'd rather use a trackball, and I despise those. Touch-sensitive controls for disc ejection, audio, wi-fi, etc are difficult to get to work, requiring practice and coming up with your own method. When pressing keys, sometimes the adjacent key will grab your finger.On the plus side, the hinges are pretty strong, as is the case. Engraved nameplate on the bottom was nice, wore it off in short order though.I've heard a lot of people have overheating issues with this one, but it stays pretty cool for me.It's a nice computer, but with all of the problems $2000 is way too much.", "Date": "July 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Alienware is overrated crap.", "Author": "ELencher", "ReviewID": "R1IJFC4Z1K7VW6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Worst Design ever....1) Weighs far to much to be a viable lap top...More of a Desktop that moves...That's forgivable.2) Overheated CONSTANTLY...If you play a game for more the 20 minutes PC will shut off and you will not be able toturn back on for 20 minutes.3) Eventually Charger cord stopped working...I replaced it only to find that the powerport on the motherboard itself had shorted out...I think it finnally overheated to the point that it cooked the internals....4) I took this thing apart to salvage what parts I could...What I found is that it has 3 fans inside...1 for each videocard and one for the CPU...Each fan is attatched to a MASSIVE copper heatsink designed to blow hotair out of the machine...Why therefore did this thing always overheat???
