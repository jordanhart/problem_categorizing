And, this is the best one I've gotten so far.  Nothing really stands out but it's just altogether well made.  When you strike the keys, it feels very nice.  The picture quality of the screen is good.  Programs load up pretty quickly.  Every laptop I've purchased I have regretted.  I bought a laptop that was small and lightweight.  I  thought that it would be great to carry around.  But, I learned that ease of carrying it around doesn't justify the small screen.  Then, I went the other way and bought a huge screen.  But, the weight made it so cumbersome.  For example, just typing on your lap was annoying.  But, this laptop seems perfect.  Light, good screen size, and programs work perfect.  Here are some points that I hope helps you make a decision.Pros:1. Touchpad.  I love the touchpad.  Very responsive.  And you can scroll up/down and sideways by using two fingers.  Never seen that before!  Of course, you can zoom in and out by bringing your fingers together and out.Cons:1. low battery life.  After a few hours of web surfing, you'll have to replug.  My other laptops lasted much longer right after purchasing.

The only downside is a cut in battery life, the AMD gets a little over 4 hours, while I could only get about 3 out of this one. That is under constant use browsing web pages, and using wifi.It is no speed demon, but it gets the job done. The display has good color, and is bright enough for use outdoors. The USB 3.0 port is a nice touch.Before Windows 8 was released, this model was selling for $329, and could often be found on sale for $299. And at that price, it is an amazing machine.

My husband was so impressed with the Asus computer that he preferred it to our Toshiba AND our HP laptops. In fact, he spent nearly all of Thanksgiving break playing around on her computer. Speakers are good, graphics are good, and I genuinely prefer Windows 7 to Windows 8, which was probably *the* deciding factor in choosing this Asus laptop over several other models in this price point, most of which were equipped with Windows 8. Keep in mind this was during the week of Black Friday, so there were tons of deals on laptops, but this one seemed like the best buy to me, and I was right.She absolutely loves the computer. We got her set up with a free 60-day trial of Microsoft Home and Student, which is actually my only complaint, that computers don't come with software like that anymore! Not anything against the computer itself, just against the current market and the unfortunate situation that puts many broke students like herself in...having to shell out an extra $100+ for software just so they can write a paper or create a presentation.Bottom line: Buy it!

My last two laptops were a Toshiba and an HP.  Both were relatively inexpensive at around $500 and they both felt really cheap.  Both also died around the 3 year mark.  I literally had tape holding the HP together at the end, and it barely ever left my coffee table. The toshiba was physically ok at the end, but totally crashed and could not be recovered even after bringing it to computer repair people.  While I don't know what the longevity of this Asus will be, it feels and looks so much better out of the box, even though it is the least expensive.  The screen is beautiful.  It is fairly light for such a large computer.  The battery life isn't great, but I am so used to the batteries on my last laptops loosing their charge after a year or so that I am happy to have any battery life.  Programs were easy to instal.  I really like the feel of the keyboard and track pad.  Someone mentioned that the volume is too low, but that can be adjusted with the pre-installed desktop icon that says \"Asus Sonic Foccus.\"  I actually think the sound quality is pretty decent.  Overall, my computing needs are pretty basic.  This computer is great for the basic stuff.  Of course, it runs slow until  you install all of the windows updates, but as soon as you have installed all windows updates and an anti-virus program, you should be trouble free as I have been.

It looks like some pixels are missing or frozen. It's random, and I can't tell if it's the computer or the operating system that is glitching out. I have some screen shots, I sent off to ASUS to see what they say.Doesn't look like I can attach screen shots here.EDIT -------I've updated my review to give this a 3 out of 5, instead of a 1. I'm still upset about the disc not being sent with the computer and not being able to reinstall Windows, but some of that is Microsoft's fault as well. Also, most manufactures don't include discs anymore (which is stupid since you can't even make a recovery disc either), so that's not really an ASUS issue. Any laptop is going to be like that now.When I plugged in a USB mouse I was able to navigate the operating system better, even though it's still confusing because Microsoft changed everything around.I used the computer all night last night to talk to one of my friends on Yahoo Messenger, and to surf the internet for homework and it worked pretty well for that.So for a basic model that is cheap, if you're going to be using the internet and things like email, it's probably going to be okay. But don't expect to do a lot more then that with it. I guess for the price you can't expect much more anyway.Now I just need to see how long this thing will last. If I have any problems with the computer or anything, I will update this review. If there are no updates here, then everything is still working well.  Posted  2/4/2013ORIGINAL BELOW ------I like the computer, it has a nice keyboard that is easy to use. It's not really that fast, when you are instaling udpates and things like that. It took me over 20 mins sitting at the library just to install windows updates.The Asus Live Update program is SO ANNOYING. It pops up without warning and takes over your screen and starts downloading files, without even asking if it's okay. I can be in the middle of typing something and BAM an update screen is in my face with focus set to it, so I can't type anymore.There is no way to backup the system. Asus tech support told me to use the AI Recovery program (or what ever it was called) to burn the DVD to backup the system. But after I couldn't find it, I did some checking to find out that, it's no longer included with this model.So they told me to use the Windows 8 disc image utility to create a backup of my system image... Well... Low and Behold, Microsoft took out that utility in the public release of Windows 8, so that's also impossible.1. Doesn't come with any discs, so if I need to reinstall the operating system I'm *****ed. Sure they tell you that it's included on a seperate partition of the hard drive, but WHAT IF THE HARD DRIVE CRASHES??2. Okay, so use the Asus utility to create a backup of your system, just in case, OH WAIT that was removed form this model.3. Okay! No problem! I'll just use the Windows 8 utility to create a backup of the system image. OH WAIT!!!! That was removed from the operating system as well.Manufactures don't even give you a disc anymore, which is so stupid because the disc can't cost more than 2 cents. I paid for the computer. I want my disc.It's just a scam to get you to buy a new computer and/or new operating system if you ever need to reinstall. I guess if anything ever happens to this computer, I have 2 choices, either send it back to ASUS and be without my computer for a week or two waiting for the shipping of the laptop, or go to the store and by a new copy of Windows 8.The other thing is that is has Windows 8 installed on it. Which is designed for a tablet computer. Most of the functions tell me \"swipe the screen to activate this feature.\" \"swipe to do this\" \"swipe to do that\" I tried swiping for 15 mins, before I realized that THIS ISN'T A TOUCH SCREEN MONITOR. So how the heck can I navigate most of the operating system?", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unsatisfied", "Author": "Melanie Hollander", "ReviewID": "R2B0T6Y25ME2XW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Everything about this laptop was fine and very much what I expected as far as quality.

The price vs features for this Asus LT was too good to be true so I took a chance and I purchased it for $350 from Amazon.com. So far this LT is operating very well - no problems so far. It came with an Intel processor, 4GB RAM,  a 457GB HDD that is divided into two volumes (C & D Drives), 2 USB ports, a high speed internet port, a SVGA port, and 1 HDMI port.The screen and keyboard are both HUGE and they make this LT very easy to use - much easier than my old laptop. The web surfing speed is excellent and Macafee Anti-virus comes pre-installed. I connect to the internet via the ethernet port so I can't speak about WIFI connectivity.The LT is extremely light and I suppose that is an asset.

I give this computer 4 stars so far and I may give it a higher or lower rating based on it's future performance and durability.The only minor issue is that it would have been nice for Asus to mark the left & right click buttons with a white or red line on the button itself because these buttons are hard to see while using the laptop in a dim or dark environment (the left & right click buttons are the same color as the laptop - black).

Well, the 'fine print' is that if you did not register for warranty service within 60 days of purchasing the laptop then you're ineligible to file a claim.

I bought it for my wife for Christmas and she is very hard on computers. She's had it for about one year and we have never had a single problem with it. It starts up relatively quickly, had been dropped and banged around more than once and it always starts on the first try. We have not had to reboot it or contact customer service at all. Granted, we run Norton Anti-Virus on it but that's the price you pay for a Windows machine. Personally, I would never buy another Windows machine, but if you're going to the Asus is a fine option. In fact, unlike this computer, Dells and HPs that I have owned had more problems than in one year than this one has had. I would buy an Asus again if I were going to buy a PC, which I'm not, because Macs are superior to all PCs irrespective of the manufacturer. Also, I'd note that this one has a great battery life and runs a lot cooler than older laptops I've owned. The only drawback on this PC is that the volume/speakers is really low. Perhaps I'm doing something wrong but the speakers seem very weak.UPDATE:It's been a few days over a year since I bought this, a few days past the Asus warranty, and the computer totally crashed and is stuck on the Windows welcome screen. I do not know if this is the software or the hardware, however, doing some research on Google showed that other Asus owners have experienced the same thing. And of course, it is not covered by the \"Square Trade\" warranty I bought. I bought the Asus because my friend had good luck with an Acer so I thought I'd get the same results with another Asian branded PC.

I have always liked ASUS and so was biased towards purchasing an ASUS when looking for a laptop to purchase.  Given the price of this model I was very suprised at the performance.  It has more performance than I need for my uses which include streaming video, surfing the web, running application software like word processors, etc.  I do not know how the laptop would perform for gaming or more stressing applications.  The ASUS quick start is also fantastic and actually works (something Microsoft has failed to do with a slow start for many years).ASUS also met my expectations on quality.  The laptop seems light but sturdy with a very nice keyboard and touchpad.  I would recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a good, basic laptop.CONS;  Given the price I don't have many cons and rate this laptop as 5 stars (this is an inexpensive laptop). The laptop does have an LCD display which makes off-angle viewing poor and may impact battery life.  The display resolution is only 768 pixels high which can require scrolling for some web pages (horizontal resolution is great).  The speakers seem to have low volume though I rarely use them.  Battery life seems to be 2-3 hours.  I may spring for the LED display version for my next laptop though.Overall I love the laptop and it exceeded my expectations.

I had an HP that died on me a few months ago, and it was almost the same to buy this, as it was to get the HP fixed.My main complaint is not with the laptop, but the OS.  Yes, I am a Win 8 hater.  I gave it a try, but after a couple of hours all I wanted was my 'Start' button (without jumping through hoops).  Since I already had Win 7  on my broken laptop, I pulled the drives and swapped them.  I can tell you that swapping drives was fairly painless.  The drive has a bracket on it with standard screw holes, so I made quick work of it.  Booted in Bios a couple of times to set up the drive, reactivated Windows, and it works like a champ.  Maybe I'll put and SSD drive in it in a year or so.The screen is very nice.  The speakers are a little tinny, but it is a laptop.There are only 2 USB ports on the laptop.  I wish laptop makers would move away from VGA plugs.  I used a HDMI to DVI cable to hook it to a monitor and it works great.  If you plan on using any accessories (external mice, keyboards, USB drives, etc), I would suggest getting a dedicated USB hub.  I am pushing a second external monitor using a USB video card, and it works fine.CPU is a little underpowered if you are a heavy users.  I use the laptop for web surfing, Amazon videos, and it is fine.  Also, as noted in other reviews THERE IS ONLY ONE RAM SLOT.  I am waiting on my single 8GB DIMM now.  The 4GB DIMM installed is a DDR3-1600 (12800).  I needed the extra boost to run some work apps (VPN, Notes). 4GB should be fine for the casual user.Overall, I give it a recommend.

As for the keyboard, there are so many keys,on the 15.6 inch laptop, it is hard to find the delete key without looking for it. The little 13.3 Asus windows 7 computer has a basic keyboard, not so many keys, but it is easy to find everything.  Both Asus computers have a great screen clearness, colors are wonderful, They both run flawlessly, I cannot tell you that either is better, but if you like a big screen, this one is great. I still favor my little 13.3, but that is a matter of preference. I bought this because the cheap priced Dell, crashed & eventually I should have it going again, but ex wife needs it for the college courses, I figured that this will be dependable, but if she still likes her old xp Dell, it is just as fast but on a smaller screen, & the other one will be a spare. College programs destroy good computers, they constantly fill it with ad ware. My job is to keep them cleaned out so they can do their work. Son is in college too.  So while she (grandma) is doing college on one computer, she uses the other for references & for look up. I think that two computers side by side are a great way to getting things done. Some people may complain about the black surface smudges, but my concern is what the computer will do, & how much trouble will it cause me. I think I will treasure my windows 7 computers for a long time, they work better than any other computers lately. I also have an old Asus 9 inch Linux Ubuntu computer, it is only 900mhz but it is really quick at the coffee shops. The problem that I have is that it is difficult to upgrade, & it needs an old wifi to run on.  It's been a while since I fell in love with these windows 7 Asus computers, this A54C is a very fast computer 2.3 ghz, I get excited clicking on things & it usually keeps up with me. I bought one of these earlier, & now I got another one for me.  Its nice to have a cd drive in it. You can watch movies or load programs so easily. I still like to save things on SD memory chips too. There is a port on the front & the sound plugs too. The speaker sound is quiet, But this usually stays home, & I have a amplified speaker set really close. Just Don't forget to make backup disks, before you keep it too long, A good windows 7 disk could cost you, when all you have to do is put a blank DVD disk, about 640 megs of setup files run on that, which is your windows, when a computer crashes.  It takes about 4 Disks for your programs & personal stuff, that can be saved for all of the rest.  Grandma has claimed the other A54C computer for her college work, she says that the computer can do everything she asks for it to do, all by itself. I also like the nice clear screen too. Colors are sharp, but I am getting spoiled, I feel that all other computers have a dull screen.  I have owned this computer one week, grandma had hers one month, she uses hers for college, I just play on mine. I have encountered confusion that when I type that occasionally when I type the curser jumps back & writes on a previous spot, I am clumsy, & I feel that I am bumping another key which causes this. But as far as an adventure in computing, I am having more fun with this computer, than I have had in 15 years of computing. I love music, & I just upgraded my NoteWorthy Composer program that I had for 12 years. I can create midis, It now has a keyboard on the note page. It makes writing songs much easier than the original program.  I love word web, my computer dictionary program, it helps me to spell, or look up words, but its much styled like the old dictionary. This laptop has a big screen, yet is light enough to compete with the light weights. Its strong enough that I don't believe that anything will fall apart. I am not a gamer & I do not expect the ultimate in speed, but as far as 2.3 ghz, it is fast enough to keep me happy.  I have decided that my clumsy fingers on the keyboard was not the only problem, I tried a tablet keyboard usb, & everything worked fine, I finally decided that it needed another keyboard, if you need replacement, you will have to take a knife, & push each tab up at the top of the keyboard, one at a time & pry it up a little, & then the next tab, the bottom of the keyboard is an aluminum plate. You have to take notice of the keyboard ribbon before you order a new one, one ribbon points straight up, the other points up & curves to the left. There are two different keyboards that might fit, this is how you tell the difference. My first Asus linux had a bad key from one drop of water, so now that this keyboard developed a defect, it is easy to switch out,& only $20, they all are the same in that respect. If the keyboard seems springy, it is possible that it may have been bent in shipment, the foundation under the keyboard is solid.  I replaced the keyboard, & notified the keyboard company that the flimsy box allowed the keyboard to get bent & that they needed an additional box containing the first box. Even though, I bent it back the best I could, it still shows some ripple, & I told the company that their fine quality keyboard looks cheap, when it gets bent in shipment.  The curser line jumping to other lines has improved, since changing the keyboard. Normally you only replace the keyboard when only a few drops of water, disables certain letters, from working anymore.", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am describing for three asus laptops", "Author": "shortglide", "ReviewID": "R1NOTZ41VEY05X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have now had three asus  laptops.

However, I had to follow up with them multiple times and they kept saying to me that the progress was good and the computer would be returned \"soon\". Well, 5 months later the computer was returned to my doorstep still broken. I contacted them immediately to inquire about this... They informed me that they had no idea why that would happen and also stated that they had never spoken to me before. I said that this was interesting because there was a label from their warehouse and the RMA was still attached to the box. I did some research and found out that this company often \"loses\" computers that they agree to fix. I decided that I did not want to return the computer to them again just to wait another 5 months for it to come back broken again. this would effectively void the 1 year hardware warranty. So, I told them I wanted a refund. That did not work, they gave me another RMA and asked me to return it again. I said that this was unacceptable and contacted AMAZON.

Then we also tried connecting with ethernet at home.  It worked.  So we determined the problem HAD to be our internet/cable company.  We called Comcast and they connected remotely to the laptop and changed some settings ON THE COMPUTER which allowed the laptop to recognize and connect to my home network.  Problem is solved.....so we are keeping the laptop.  But I can't give it more than 3 stars because I'm not personally using the laptop.  I'm sticking with my MacBook Pro!  :o)**********After researching laptops for my teenager (and reading several outstanding reviews), I decided on this notebook as a Christmas present for my son so he would have his own and stop using my MacBook pro.  He opened it and we started to set it up but there was an issue with connectivity to our WIFI.  It kept saying that it was connected to my home network but then also said, \"no internet access\".  After several reboots, troubleshooting attempts, resetting modem, etc., I finally called support and was surprised to find someone to help me on Christmas Eve.  We spent 1 1/2 hours on the phone troubleshooting and as a last resort setting the notebook back to its factory settings.  Nothing.  Could not figure out the problem, especially since my MacBook and other wireless devices in the home were connected with no issue.  Needless to say, I'm frustrated and have decided to return the computer and find a different one.  I even Googled the problem and it appeared that there were numerous forums about this very issue (connected, but \"no internet access\") and some seem to believe it is a Windows 7 issue?  When I mentioned the many forums to the tech on the phone, he stated that I was the first person he heard of to have this issue.  I guess that's why he couldn't help me further.Oh well.  Back to the factory and back to Square One.  Spending 1 1/2 hours on the phone on Christmas Eve was enough for me to be completely turned off by this 'supposedly great brand'....and now I have to go back to sharing my laptop until I find another one.  Arrrrrgh.The real bummer is that I bought it a week ago and it's been sitting under the tree since then.
