It runs photoshop, the full office suite, and my developer environments (mainly visual studio 2012) with no issues at all.Its so fast you really don't know its a tablet, the screen and build is just great.. sure, if you are going to use it for a desktop replacement - you might want to spring for a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse - they are totally usable - but a little cramped for heavy use.p.s. the battery, given the power of this device is really not bad at all - its just lasted 4 hours on my lap, developing in one window, while watching a video in another.. all while I sit in bed !Love it !!", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ultrabook with the most intuitive tablet mode", "Author": "myhumbleopinion", "ReviewID": "R3L1AV7ALW3ST2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My first impression when I picked up this tiny Ultrabook was WOW!!!!!!It's so light and fell in love immediately. You pull up on the back of the screen and it pops up into laptop mode. It's really cool. Folks keep coming by just to see it pop open then slide closed. (oooh do it again!)It's hard to believe that you get a full on Win8 PC in such a tiny package.Pros:- Light weight + very cool styling- Solid feel: the sliding hinge may raise some eyebrows when you first look at it but I have to say after using it for some time it's rock solid.- The touch screen is stunning at 1080p(IPS). The Win8 tiles are also a breeze to scroll through.- It's really powerful. Much better than my work PC.Cons:So why 1 star off? Quite simply, the keyboard is too small to use for every day productivity. If I hooked it up to an external monitor/keyboard everytime I needed to do work it'd be absolutely fine. (can't always do that when traveling)Conclusion: The title says it all", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Supplier and great product", "Author": "naserals", "ReviewID": "R1F0DZX15LWR2L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I'd like to highlight the quality of service of the supplier. The product was shipped even before the predicted time and was delivered three weeks before the predicted arrival time. In addition to that, it was well wrapped-up. So, great supplier.The product is amazing: material quality, resolution, weight, and size. You don't compare this product to tablets like iPad, it is way advanced. It is a powerful machine that you can use to develop and do thing within this line. At the same time, you can use it as a normal regular tablet to surf the net.It comes with a stylus (a pen). A sensitive stylus that would detect the pressure.You need to get use to the keyboard.other than that the product is amazing!", "Date": "January 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Readingisfun", "ReviewID": "RQFIGCWQ5PDUW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very fast and efficient.

The touch screen is sensitive, the computer is very fast and responsive.Now for the cons...It is not a desktop. I tried using it as a desktop by attaching it to a large touch screen monitor (Acer 27\") d using it to multitask. Though it has a i7 core processor and 8 GB of ram it bottlenecks when multitasking. I had to disable so many SONY background programs to get it t run smoothly. If you are into multitasking I.E. watching videos while surfing Youtube, doing research, converting files, playing games it slows down. Also it is not very good at heavy duty PC games. I tried playing Farcry 3 on it , I had to play in medium mode and it still lagged sometimes, Tomb Raider had lags and rendering gaps.Battery life is not very good, I even bought the \"sheet\" and I feel it still did not last as long.Other than that this computer is great. if you really need more details ask.", "Date": "June 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poorly designed", "Author": "Fingschlyster", "ReviewID": "R3QGBYAG3ENU46", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've owned the Sony VAIO Duo 11.6 for five months and it's already been returned to  Sony 2 times for repair.

The concept behind this tablet/laptop with Intel i7, 8 gig's  ram, SSD, etc. is outstanding, but Sony  design  engineers  didn't  think through the design  and really  blew  it.
