They are 74 and 77 years old, respectively.Since their old PC was Vista--need I say more?--I thought that the more reliable Windows 7 operating system would be to their liking. I did not want to burden them with Windows 8, which is not appealing to most of my friends, who are in their 40s and early 50's.It was easy to configure the Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome browsers to their liking.The touch pad was something new for them. Both are trying to get used to it. I did teach them to turn it off when they are typing documents, in case the trackpad is too sensitive and starts causing keyboard errors. Even if a mouse is connected to the system, if the trackpad is not turned off, there may still be typing errors.I like the DVD burner. I used it immediately to make eRecovery disks, one set for myself and one for them. The password reinstaller  CD may also be a helpful thing to do early on. It is easy to find the eRecovery area, in case you need to reinstall it to original factory specifications. I like that feature. In the older models, it was not always there.I removed some bloatware, like the Norton Backup and the version of McAfee that came with it. I installed the McAfee software from their internet provider, instead, which did not take very long.Installing their external hard drive with our family photos was also easy to do. The screen quality is good. With their old Vista PC, the slide show did not function well. I did not need to worry here. It shows Youtube videos without hesitating, which I tried after the Adobe Flash Player was updated.I own other Acer laptops, the Acer Aspire One 725-0899, Win 7, which I use for word processing and business trips. It sometimes hesitates during Hulu viewing, but for the convenience of portability that fits in my purse, it's okay. I don't like the SD slot, in which the cards stick frequently, requiring tape and pressure with fingers to extract the card. I have 2 old XP machines, which are Aspire 5002 WIMI and an old netbook Aspire One, which are compatible to my workplace computers. I still use them sometimes.I am very satisfied with the Acer E1-531-2686 as being family friendly, good for emails, multimedia, and general purpose use.It is also a very attractive red color, which pleased my mom very much.I hope the company keeps this model around longer. I really don't like Windows 8. People need alternatives before Windows Blue fixes the problems that we have currently.", "Date": "September 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Budget Laptop", "Author": "PhilMcKrevice", "ReviewID": "R7N4GDONK5A2U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like you, I needed a laptop and started my search on Amazon only to compare what I liked to the big box stores.  I was looking for a cheap \"beater\" laptop.  I didn't need anything fancy, and this laptop looked like it fit the bill.This laptop comes with a Celeron processor.  I had images in my mind about the Celerons of yesteryear and was put off by this because they were typically slow.  I took a chance without looking into the CPU further due to the price.  This Celeron is an Ivy Bridge processor which was a huge shock to me.  And though it's not an i3,i5 or i7 it does the job just fine.Who should buy this and why.You should buy this if:You need something somewhat inexpensiveYou want a computer that has Windows 7You need a CD/DVD driveYou want a laptop that has a full size key boardYou want/need a laptop that has a large hard drive - this laptop has a 500 gb hard driveYou do not want to \"upgrade\" to Windows 8I personally do not use the keyboard as I am not a fan of the style of keys that this laptop has.  Plus the layout is weird and my fingers never got used to it. I would have preferred the mouse pad to be moved over to the right about 3-4 inches.  No matter.  I bought a Logitech wireless keyboard right away as nothing beats a real deal full size keyboard.The battery life is pretty good.  I have not timed it out, but I'd say it's on par with Acer's claims.One thing that does suck is the bloatware (pre-installed software) that comes on this machine, which is to be expected nowadays.  It does come with a bunch BUT you can get rid of all of it almost immediately using PC Decrapifier.  This works very well.  I highly recommend.  Plus, it's free.Basically if you want something cheap(ish) do not ignore this laptop.  I consider myself to be a more advanced user as I have built numerous computers from scratch, so my expectations are somewhat high...and even so I find this laptop to be above average for my needs.  I'm sure at some point I could upgrade the RAM, but at this point I don't even see the need.For the money, I think you would be hard pressed to find something comparable with the features this has.11/14/13 UPDATEI play Left 4 Dead 2 on the regular.  Not on my laptop but on my main desktop computer.  I was bored last night and hopped on Steam and downloaded L4D2 on this laptop, just to check.  I was expecting it to be laggy and choppy, and eventually crash, due to tons of fast moving objects on screen.  I was way wrong.  Talk about impressive!  This game plays very well on this laptop.  Not like my main computer...but then, my main computer has a video card in it that was more expensive than this laptop.  I did notice some choppiness when the screen filled with zombies, but nothing that made me want to turn if off.  I was planning on getting rid of this laptop and then get another one with a video card so I could play games, but after playing last night, I don't see the need anymore.  I'm keeping this until it dies.  Way to go Acer.12/12/13 UPDATEI have experienced my first hardware/software problem with this laptop.  There are 3 USB ports.  1 on the left and 2 on the right.  The port that is closest to me on the right hand side has pretty much died.  Anytime I plug something in it says that the device has failed.  But this is weird.  I can plug my smart phone in, and it will charge the phone, but that's it.  I cannot access anything on my phone.  But when I move it to the port next to it, I can access everything/charge the phone.  So there is power there, but something is not right.  Annoying?  Yes, as I am using the other 2 ports on a consistent basis.  One for the wireless keyboard and 1 for my external mouse.I went into the device manager and tried uninstalling the \"unknown device\" and then plugging my phone back in, in the hopes that it will reinstall the driver for the phone like normal, and that didn't do anything.  When I plug my mouse into this port, the laser does not come on, and it does not work, yet there is power there to charge a phone, but not enough to allow you to do anything else with this port.Maybe this is hardware, maybe it's software and the computer could use a fresh install of Windows 7.  I may try that out later on down the road.  Or maybe I'll say screw it and just buy a USB hub and deal with it.  This is not a deal breaker, I still love this laptop.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop with nice win7 system\uff01", "Author": "Lara Davis", "ReviewID": "RRV0VL9CO0IV6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was a good choice for people like me who want to still keep having the win7 instead of win8.Then I found this deal\uff0cit was deep red with win7,running pretty fast\uff0cgood for my work\uff0clove it\uff01", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "great laptop", "Author": "Roman", "ReviewID": "R3641GFQQAPCP8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all it has 1005m 1.9ghz processor.

The \"app\" interface was very off-putting to me in the laptop setting, and though you can use the \"desktop\" side it did not have full operational control of the computer and you still had to do some basic things on the \"app\" side.  Others may like it fine, especially if you like social media integrated into everything you do (I don't).  But it was not for me.  I began looking for comparable inexpensive lighter-weight laptops with Windows 7, as most new machines are outfitted in Windows 8.  After searching for a bit, I came across this Acer.  I read the Amazon reviews as well as a few \"tech\" reviews I found on the web and gave it a try.  I was also motivated by the fact that I've had an Acer tablet for 3.5 years and it has been a reliable and sturdy little machine.  Acer products are not high on \"glamour\" and \"bells and whistles\" but get the job done for significantly less than more popular tech manufacturers.  My assessment of the laptop after a month comports with my prior Acer experience.  It does everything it should for my laptop needs.  If you have more specialized or sophisticated use (such as heavy gaming, etc.) perhaps this would not be the right machine but for basic web browsing, document production, music and videos I couldn't ask for more, especially for the price.

Ordered on a Saturday night and got it Monday morning at work, which is impressive. Spent some time running windows update, uninstalling McAfee and replacing with Avast. Malwarebytes did not encounter any pre-existing infections. I was able to transfer Office 2007 from the HP over to this machine resulting in *more* updates. The machine is sleek and lighter than the old HP pavilion and the fan rarely kicks in. The casing does show fingerprints easily and feels less solid than the old machine.Pros: windows 7 home premium instead of the abomination that is win8, nice 15.6 inch screen and casing, 4 gigs of ram is enough non-gamer needs.Cons: A couple of things that are a bit irritating, the touchpad is quite sensitive which can be adjusted but the location is left-of-center which often results in placing your hands in the wrong position. The click-bar under the touch pad is one solid piece, not divided into two segments for left-click, right click functions. You can still do these functions but it may be confusing to a novice. The off-center location of the touchpad is something you just have to get used to. The speakers are underneath and the sound quality is okay but the volume is rather quiet, even on max. I'm considering getting external speakers and realize this machine doesn't have bluetooth.Overall, I'm happy with the machine, with a modest investment in wired external speakers it will be even better.Addendum after a few months of use: I still have good feelings about this laptop. We did in fact invest in a pair of those inexpensive popup speakers which helps boost the sound quite a bit.

I had to call Acer 3 times. The first time I called Acer the representative tried to troubleshoot over the phone with no success.  The representative from Acer told me that because all the trouble shooting we did over the phone did not work, I needed to PAY $ 20.00 for recovery disks I needed to purchase from them.  So, I have the computer one month and the computer completely crashes and the consumer has to PAY for recovery disks????I receive the recovery disks and after trying to run the recovery disks 3 TIMES the computer would crash when I got to the 4th disk (I am not incompetent with computers). I called Acre again.  The rep walked me through trying to troubleshoot again\u2026. this time it would take over 12 hours for the computer to try to run the disks, after 12 hours the laptop still did not work.  I called Acer AGAIN. The representative from Acer told me I would now have to ship the laptop to Acer to have the laptop serviced and if they were not able to repair the issue they would have to replace the hard drive.  I expressed to the Acer representative this entire process was completely unacceptable.  I advised the Acer representative I wanted nothing to do with the laptop and wanted to return it, at the bare minimum replace the laptop with a NEW one. The Acer representative that was there policy and they would not replace my computer but only troubleshoot the one I purchased.

The keys don't press down too easily, but it is not like typing on a typewriter, either.Negatives: The speakers are terrible.  You can barely hear anything.

I just assumed that would be standards on laptops today.  I don't know if it is the computer or Internet Explorer, but IE shuts down on me at least twice a day.

The previous owner's data was still inside, but description says\"refurbished\". I had to restore this to factory state, had to pay $50 to find out necessary drivers  to use my printer are not available longer from Acer.  I purchasedthis so I could reinstall the software for a year-old e-printer, or wireless printer that I accidentally restored to factory status by touching the wrong option on keypad. I had other software on discs and needed a laptop with OPTICAL drive, after a tech from the company where I purchased the e-printer and laptop destroyed laptop withsuper glue, then refunded money to wrong credit card, who n took this money thinking I wanted to pay off most of my balance!  An Amazon rep recommended I purchase this Acer as this was all I actually needed a laptop for, considering I owned four other ways to access internet, NEVER MENTIONING optical drives  are now sold separately like external hard drives. I gave this one star because this was definitely not what I needed, it was described as being refurbished and fulfilled by Amazon, until invoice showed otherwise and sold as Prime Eligible. This may suit another's needs, but should you want to print or use any software..in other words- if all you're looking for is a means to get online, maybe -MAYBE- this will work for you. If you want to view DVDs stick to whatever you're using now.  If you want to stream video this model I returned had to be connected via ethernet cable; attached to WiFi modem, plugged into this laptop.  But after shutting down, it never came on again. Another thing regarding the description provided here, there was no Windows Home Premium in it, it was just Windows 7 and Recycle Bin.

All's well for a couple of months.2- JANUARY 9th, 2014:  Laptop developes a defect.  One of its three USB ports fails, resulting in the computer's failure to recognize any hardware that is plugged into it (I soon notice upon close examination, that one of the port's 4, internal, metal contact strips has become displaced, so that its alignment can't correlate with that of the corresponding contact strip of any plug).3- Contacted \"Acer.\"  They issue me a \"case number\" and instruct me to mail the computer to their factory in Texas, for repair under-warrantee, at MY EXPENSE for the shipping cost of >$20.  I oblige.4- Receive computer back from them about 2-1/2 weeks later.  All's well, once again.5- JANUARY 28th (just under 3 weeks later):  A DIFFERENT USB port developes the IDENTICAL problem!  I again phone \"Acer.\"  They issue me a new return-case number and again instruct me to mail it back to them (THIS time, though, they e-mailed me a pre-paid shipping label for return via \"Fed Ex\"... don't know why they didn't do so for the first problem).  I send back the unit to them.5- They again replace the 2nd defective USB port, under warrantee and I receive the laptop back from them about another 2 weeks thereafter.  All's well, once again for a few more weeks.6- MARCH 12th:  A few days ago, while on the internet with the laptop at my local library via their Wi-Fi, my Acer suddenly loses internet contact (no one else around me there on their laptops seems to be experiencing any problem).  I shut off the computer, wait a few minutes and re-boot it.....STILL no internet access (and the wi-fi indicator icon at bottom of my screen is \"greyed out\" with a small, red \"x\" over it).  Ever since, the computer fails to recognize ANY wi-fi signal.  AGAIN I phone \"Acer\" a THIRD TIME and speak with a technical-support representative.

I had been on a search for a laptop for a few months.  I had an Acer Netbook which I bought 5 years ago.  It was getting slow, the mouse pad stopped working, and now with windows XP no longer being supported it is a time bomb.When looking for a laptop I was looking for one specific feature: Not windows 8.  I think Microsoft has lost it's way in trying to force it's mobile operating system on computers.  It does not work as well for a laptop or desktop.  It is a mobile OS and should only be on phones, mp3 players and tablets.  Microsoft also has a history of having a very bad OS every other release:Windows 3.1 = goodWindows 95 = badWindows 98 = good (the best)Windows ME = bad.Windows XP = goodWindows Vista = BadWindows 7 = goodWindows 8 = badSo the laptop had to have windows 7.  This met that requirement.  It had a 500 gig hard drive, 4 gigs of ram, a big screen, and a dvd drive.  And it was less than $500.It did come installed with a lot of garbage from the manufacturer.  But it only took an hour and a half to get all of it off.  Which is actually quite quick compared to other computers I've purchased.I am loving the machine.
