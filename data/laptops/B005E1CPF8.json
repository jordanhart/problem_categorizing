{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally a Notebook", "Author": "Andi", "ReviewID": "R3MYVSZIM5GT01", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Finally a device arrived that's worth to be called a notebook. The unit packs a powerful punch of CPU, fast memory and solid state storage which is finally starting to reach practical capacities and capabilities. The top end i7 model fully loaded (4GB RAM, 256GB SDD at the time) does easily rival a MacBook Pro, and outperforms my 2007 17\" MacBook Pro (2.4GHz dual, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD with 4GB SDD cache). No moving parts other then the fan, which hardly comes on. The missing optical drive may throw you off originally but other then for software installation and burning the odd DVD you will hardly miss it during day-to-day use. In that case the optional USB drive doesn't break the bank, and if you have another Mac somewhere you can easily mount that drive remotely. The only downside, and I found this will all my MacBooks in the past, is the poor lighting of the displays, it's uneven and most noticeably darkens in corners and edges. I would understand burnout after years of use like mine that run 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, some 5+ years now. But not with a new device out of the box. There are more significantly lower priced Laptops out there that do a much better job in that area. Now, I use the unit as a business notebook with mainly commercial apps and a WIndows VM on top, so I can live with it, but it's still not acceptable at that price point.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Have the same one, but paid $1570 after tax", "Author": "qwerty", "ReviewID": "R1NUL386CK24LN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Get it from the apple store online refurbished and save a lot of $$$$.

I like how it boots up instantly, and the almost weightlessness of it.  Hey it is an Apple what did you expect me to say.  LOL.

It's thin, light with a nice screen, good keyboard, and beautiful battery life, it's exactly what I wanted, expected and got. At just under 3 lbs, I sometimes forget that it's in my computer bag. I love how thin and light it is, the super fast startup is also a plus, 256Gb SSD is awesome.  I absolutely love the battery life and the speed of this little machine. I would definitely recommend this unit it if you don't need an optical drive and a lot of storage.", "Date": "June 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005E1CPF8"}}
