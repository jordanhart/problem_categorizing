{"Reviews": [{"Title": "6 Hours on Tech Support", "Author": "Jeanette S Cates, PhD", "ReviewID": "RSTOU62V4W5PG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had several Dell computers in the past, so I expected this one to be as good as the others. I was wrong.The networking card would not connect to my wireless network. Searching online I found out this was a common issue for new Dells out of the box. I followed the advice of several sites, downloading software (on the computer in the office down the hall) and installing it on this one. No luck.I called Tech Support. The first woman was confused that she could not connect to my computer to diagnose the problem. I explained that WAS the problem. Two hours later she decided to transfer me to the networking group - and hung up.I called back. This woman assured me that there was no need for the networking group. She could handle it. She told me it was my router, my service provider, and just about anything else she could think of, none of which worked. Two hours later she said her shift was ending and she set an appointment to call me back the next day.She did not call. After waiting another two hours, I called Tech Support for the third time. This man assured me that he could fix the two issues - it would not connect with the wireless networking and the Dell 2405FPW external monitor I had would not show the proper resolution. By the end of his two hours, he had told me it was MY fault for buying the wrong computer that wouldn't work with the Dell monitor. (In spite of the online literature that told me Dell has never updated their drivers for that monitor.) And that he would be glad to have me send in the computer, wait a week, and see if they could fix it.I requested a refund. Then I had to jump through the hoops with two different supervisors reiterating that it was MY fault for ordering a computer without a separate graphics card. And that they would be happy to see if they could fix the networking card if only I would spend a week without my computer.Not only was I disappointed that I spent so much time trying to work out this issue, but I was also insulted that they put the blame on me Whatever happened to the idea that the customer is always right? I will never buy another Dell - nor will most of my friends, after seeing what I went through.Check my other reviews to see which computer I bought instead - and love!", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop for a Good Price", "Author": "TecGeek", "ReviewID": "R2GUBPNKWQX8PK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this laptop for $600 including taxes for Black Friday.
