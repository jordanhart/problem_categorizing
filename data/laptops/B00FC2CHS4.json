I have never owned a laptop prior to it BUT, I have used several laptops at work and laptops my friends own.  The thing that convinced me was dual monitors but, I now use it mostly as a solitary machine.The only thing I did to make this computer more usable was remove Microsoft Windows 8 and install Canonical Ubuntu 13.10.PROS: Go anywhere, do (most) any local development you could need.  I am a web developer and this machine has exceeded my needs.  I run several local sites as well as a local database for each site.  This computer runs like a champ.CONS: Comes with Microsoft Windows 8, Beats Audio doesn't work like it used to once Win8 is gone.  This is a sacrifice work making for me.RECOMMENDED FOR: Those who are looking for a workhorse laptop.  This is more than enough for anyone who is looking for a student laptop.  Student capable laptops are lazily grazing in the pasture as this machine is like the wild bull blowing steam out its nostrils as it prepares to toss the cowboy off its back.  This machine will knock your requests out like Mike Tyson.As an additional note, the touchscreen is fun and it ends there.  Don't buy this expecting a tablet experience (I would never buy a laptop due to this feature).  You will use it a few times and that's it.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price", "Author": "Futa 'Ofamo'oni", "ReviewID": "R1BD7TPFLXPC5G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop for my needs, and even for playing games (as long as they don't require better than Intel HD Graphics). The only downside I've found is the battery life, which is not good, giving me only 2 to 3 hours. For me, this is made up for with the 12Gigs of RAM, which makes many processor tasks quick. The fingerprint scanner is particularly convenient for signing in.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, excellent features for the price.", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2EYWOCIXIJOEW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have been using my HP ENVY TS 15-j053cl now for a while, and couldn't be happier.  Compared it with similarly priced Lenovo, Dell, Samsung laptops, and this is a much better purchase.  More memory and better processor for better performance than others in this price range, and feels sturdier, of better quality.I initially thought that touch screens were going to be a fad that went away... but after some use, I actually find it handy (other than our toddler touching the screen and changing everything...  ;)The only negative thing I can say about the laptop is WIndows8.  I tried and HATED it.  On the suggestion of a friend, I loaded Ubuntu, and I couldn't be happier.  All of the software I need runs through a windows emulator, and the laptop performs flawlessly.  Ubuntu 13.10 doesn't have a driver (yet) for the fingerprint reader, so that doesn't work, but my last laptop had one, and I never used it anyway.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "AMAZING LITTLE LAPTOP", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "R3VDHVPFYCIIPB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is honestly the best laptop I've ever owned and it was at a pretty decent price if you compare prices with other laptops with similar specs, you're not going to find anything like this at a better price. Plus it's touchscreen which I'm absolutely in love with. It also has a fingerprint scanner that you can use to unlock your laptop. It's pretty amazing!One thing that I would want to warn people about, something I didn't realize when I purchased it is that it doesn't have a dvd drive. That was a bit of a let down, but I plan on buying an external dvd drive, so it'll work out in the end.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "The laptop made just for me...", "Author": "Erick Flores \"ewinsock\"", "ReviewID": "R2PFLN00VR762N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All the specs that I'm looking for put together in a fine laptop.I'm very happy with my purchase.The laptop arrived on time and in the best condition.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Cool laptop and cool price", "Author": "T.

I saw the price and was going to buy it after I checked some reviews here. I found it cheaper on Amazon so I got it here. I got it fast and the only issue I had was that the touchscreen didn't work. It's a refurb but I got excellent support. HP changed the screen and sent it back in less than a week. It's really fast and will do way more than I need it to. This should last me several years. I'm not the least bit disappointed.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FC2CHS4"}}
