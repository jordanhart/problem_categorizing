{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great \"Entry Level\" Laptop", "Author": "M. Prior", "ReviewID": "R3QALK2O4ZASSV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: bright screen, great keypad, good \"entry level\" speakers, fast enough for writing & web surfingCons: \"clicking\" sound from left hingeI really only use my laptop for my writing assignments and to check email...This laptop is perfect for that. Some back story that would be helpful: This is the 3rd laptop I have purchased in my endeavor to find a replacement for my Toshiba Satellite which has lasted over 5 years. I bought and RETURNED another entry-level Satellite as well as a Gateway; long story short, they weren't better than this Lenovo.As far as typing goes, it was/is bit of a transition to switch from a basic laptop keypad to one with the numeric keypad at the right - something I've never had in a laptop. The good news is that my hand & finger placement on this laptop do not \"feel\" shifted to the left like they do on the Toshiba Satellite. And there is plenty of space for my large fingers.2.2 GHz processor and 4 GB of ram is all I need for what I do. I don't \"game\" or do any heavy graphics editing on this laptop. The boot up is quick and applications start very quickly. I have noticed on the Toshiba that when I listened to music and opened other applications that the music would \"stutter\" or pause while the processor caught up with the application. That was NOT the case with this Lenovo and multi-tasking is effortless here.As I stated above, I also like to listen to music when I work which can be a trial on most entry level laptops. The speakers on this Lenovo are really good - way better than the Toshiba (sounded like cell phone speakers) and is as good or better than the Gateway. Remember, this is a basic laptop so you won't be able to jam out with big bass.One thing that bugs me about this Lenovo: when you flip up the screen and push it all the way back, the left hinge makes this \"clicking\" sound. The sound repeats when you wiggle the screen back & forth at this point. I'm believe it's the \"build\" of the laptop and not a mechanical fault as I noticed it on the floor model. I can live with it, personally. I've never noticed anything like it on other laptops, but when you're buying in this price range, you have to take the bad with the good.Overall, if this laptop will be for you, it will suit your needs if you'll be only doing the basic administrative type tasks. If you're purchasing this for a \"gamer,\" it won't be powerful enough.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Its slow", "Author": "Stefany Bradford", "ReviewID": "R1RMVNK6MNKONY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Its really slow. I can't open more than one tab at a time or else the page with never load. This computer also doesn't like me using Facebook for some reason. Sometimes it just won't open it at all.

My son runs a number of game packages, including supporting his MineCraft server.It has delivered solid performance and great reliability at a significant discount to a new machine. I also bought a referb Lenovo desk top which has also been absolutely solid.We've had the notebook for nearly a year and the desk top for about 9 mo; both Lenovo referbs from Amazon, both solid, reliable machines.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "It was everything I expected.", "Author": "Jon S.
