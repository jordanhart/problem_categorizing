Cupp", "ReviewID": "R2ECG4KV5HY1DV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a second computer, specifically one with Windows XP. I read the seller's notes and was I surprised when it arrived. It arrived sooner than I'd expected. What I got was much more than I expected; the \"scratches and scuffs\" I didn't notice. The \"works great\" is the Honest-Abe's truth. It's always a risk buying used; I'm glad I took the chance on John Amrhein. Couldn't be happier!", "Date": "May 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell Latitude D610 Pentium M", "Author": "md2786", "ReviewID": "R3E98D6WPOD371", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very impressed with the product and the seller. First of, i received the laptop way faster than expected. Its in very good physical condition. I dont know much about laptops, but its seems to be working, hopefully as i dig further into it i would continue to be pleased. The only thing is, i hope this seller or any others can be more detailed about the conditions of their products, because it can really help. I almost didnt buy this laptop bc i was afraid it would be in bad shape.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "james young", "ReviewID": "R10QYJKY7AUJC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got it in short time, was everything they said it would be , plus!! no complaints none at all, would recommend if your looking at this comment.
