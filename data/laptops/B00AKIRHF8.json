I converted from mac, since macbook airs were exceeding my budget. I cannot do windows, so I installed the next best thing to macos: ubuntu linux. A review I saw online suggested installing linux on the build-in SSD drive, which is used for windows fast boot otherwise. It works like a charm. My laptop now boots super fast and stays super fast. It loads firefox in 4 sec (initial load, not from cache) under Ubuntu. Oh, I also did not have to load any drivers for Linux, everything just works.All of the components of this laptop function flawlessly. The problems reported by other reviewers, such as spotty wireless, slowness, etc must be due to windows 8. It is not fair to blame this laptop for those. I also kept windows 8 and playing with it from time to time, and have not seen any problems there as well.I like the keyboard and trackpad the most. They are very comfortable to use.For this price, this laptop is highly recommended.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you have the money to waste, waste it on something else!", "Author": "M. Stern \"Shutterman\"", "ReviewID": "R12EL75GRD83N", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I usually think most negative reviews are due to defective items or people not using the product correctly.  In this case, the negative reviews couldn't be more accurate and I have little to add, other than my low rating.This machine has the most spotty wifi I've ever seen, it will connect to a network, then after you close the lid, putting it to sleep, it won't connect to the same exact network it was just on when you wake it up 5 minutes later (and I'm talking even giving it a full 5 minutes to wake up)!  I've uninstalled and reinstalled the drivers about 50 times, as it's the only way to get it to reconnect.For a Core i5 with \"ExpressChache\" it boots up, and runs programs, slower than my wife's basic Core i3 HP Pavilion laptop that was half the price and has more USB 3 ports and an optical drive....The customer service is awful.  I never complain about tech support in other countries, as I personally feels it gives customers the benefit of 24/7 tech support, but when you can't understand a word the technician is saying and they can't understand you, it's kind of a problem.  I'm used to them forcing you to try steps you've already tried before but when they don't even understand what you are saying when you try to explain what you've already done...  Ugh.Also, and I'm not sure if this was mentioned in previous reviews, the Samsung specific apps that come installed with the machine don't work properly.  The \"SW Update\" (to update drivers and Bios and programs) won't let you hide updates you don't want, like it keeps telling me I need to reinstall the Norton Suite it came with despite my having another antivirus installed, and half the driver updates fail.  There's even an update for the wireless card but it fails every time, even when I'm hard-wire connected by Ethernet!  The \"S Service\" app (which is supposed to allow Samsung techs to connect remotely to your PC through the internet) starts up, says \"there is an update to this program\", downloads the update, starts back up, says \"there is an update to this program\", downloads it, restarts...  You get it, over and over again.  I let it do this for 5 hours hoping it just had a lot of information to download but it was still going!Now my biggest irk.  I called customer care about the wireless issue, which I've seen reported everywhere EXCEPT on the Samsung Support Webpages, and after a while I was told to send the Ultrabook back to Samsung.  They paid for shipping but I was responsible  for packaging the Ultrabook, where as most other companies will send you a box to make sure the machine is protected in transit, and told if the software needs to be re-installed, they will charge me $40 even when it's under warranty!!!My advice, if you have the money to waste on something that won't work correctly right from the start, waste it on something else.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost a good Ultrabook but with 1 MAJOR flaw", "Author": "Matt S.", "ReviewID": "R1I2D9S26OATAF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "There are plenty of good things to say about this laptop/Ultrabook (NP540U3C-A01CB) but they're irrelevant because the Intel hardware/software doesn't allow you to connect to wifi. More specifically, the wifi is very spotty and if you're able to connect to wifi internet, it will lose the connection immediately. If you conduct an internet search about this, you'll see that it is a widespread issue. I've owned this product for over a year and have tried many times to fix the connectivity issue without any progress. Samsung isn't helping either, it seems like they know they sold a faulty computer and don't want to admit it. To make matter worse, the ethernet cable jack is very flimsy and the ethernet cable falls out very easily with the slightest resistance.Don't waste your money on this paperweight.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost a really good laptop/ultrabook (wifi issues)", "Author": "Anonymous035", "ReviewID": "R3PUSZPR1TPBVF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "There is a known issue with Intel wifi hardware/software that Samsung and Intel haven't bothered to fix. I've had the laptop for over a year and still can't get it corrected. The wifi will connect but is sporadic at best. It probably works 20% of the time. If you're planning to use the wifi as a primary means of connectivity, look to another laptop and/or brand. I'm actually quite disappointed in Samsung for not addressing this issue. Just do an internet search for \"Samsung Series 5 wifi issues\" and you'll see that this is not an isolated issue.On the plus side, the laptop is light-weight, sturdy, good looking/stylish, has quick operating speeds, nice and responsive touchscreen, etc. (just about everything you need/want in an ultrabook)", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far is good!", "Author": "roberto Alfonzo-larrain", "ReviewID": "RTU9JN1J9XD4S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "in my opini\u00f3n Windows 8 is not very friendly, but thats OK I am stiil learning triks!the  touch screen has been a very usefull toolSamsung is doing very well, I hope warranty and services  works as well to!!!!RAL", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "good rating", "Author": "COLETTE MANHEIM", "ReviewID": "R2PSDQFD139RDB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "great purchase, like the product, works well  i had to buy software and don't really enjoy windows 8 but I would recommend purchasing because I saved close to $300", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'D BUY IT AGAIN", "Author": "CALEB", "ReviewID": "RNGT9621YQ6TX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item absolutelly overperforms its price, good price, great sound, perfect size, the touch screen wroks great, I'd buy I again if i went back on time.

I first applied all available software updates from the vendor and from Microsoft, and then connected them wirelessly to an elevated ASUS RT-AC66U router and installed the Intel Anti-Theft technology software (see my review at Amazon if interested). For the purposes of this review I will compare the Samsung to the Sony, since these machines are quite different from the Windows 7 PCs that I have in the same environment.Regarding the utility of Windows 8 and touchscreens, using this system feels like a cross between using a Windows computer and a smartphone. Using the touchscreen lets you do some fun things with multi-touch gestures, but the price to be paid is that content creators (i.e. users of Desktop legacy software) have to do a few extra keystrokes or touches to start their tasks. Since all new Windows laptops ship with Windows 8, I thought it best to pay a little extra and get a touchscreen ultrabook. Certainly the light weight and 6 hour battery life are a big improvement over my Dell E6510 laptop. However the Dell achieves twice the wireless throughput (90 Mbit/second at 45 foot range through 4 walls) of either the Samsung or the Sony.The Samsung is about 0.3 inches narrower and shallower than the Sony, and looks smaller, due to its rounded outer edges. It has been criticized for its sharp inside edge, although I haven't found that to be a problem. Both systems fit in a Case Logic 13 inch ultrabook case. The Samsung's Windows 8 Experience Index Score (top to bottom) is 6.9/5.9/4.7/6.2/5.9. Compared to the Sony, the weak points of the Samsung are: (1) Wireless adapter sometimes drops the connection (at locations where other computers can stream video with no problems), (2) Samsung software (e.g. the substitute for the Windows 7 Start Menu) and touchpad driver sometimes stops working or glitches, and is fairly annoying and confusing in that the software update application keeps prompting you to install software you may not want or need, (3) The Windows 8 Experience Index memory score is only 5.9, vs. 7.3 on the Sony, and the same-priced Sony ships with 6GB instead of 4GB RAM, and (4) The AC power connector is very small and could be accidentally damaged.It is possible that the Samsung may have longer battery life than the Sony, because its memory runs slower and its fan runs less often. The Samsung also has more comprehensive advanced processor power management settings than the Sony does (e.g. a System cooling policy).The bottom line for me is that I like the Sony better, but if Samsung improves their software and the memory issues prove not to be a problem, then the NP540U3C-A01UB deserves consideration if minimum size, sleek design, and longest battery life are paramount for you.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ultrabook...More like Ultra-suck!", "Author": "M.

I am used to Macs where everything just makes sense intuitively....this did not make sense. Every camera app ends up having it's own file of photos. :/These are the reasons I had to return.
