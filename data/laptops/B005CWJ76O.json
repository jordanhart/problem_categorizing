So, as aggravating as that is, OK, I'll need to buy a replacement. How much? EIGHTY (80) FREAKING AMERICAN DOLLARS!

It's a professional machine that handles Final Cut Pro, Photoshop and many other CPU intensive applications.Tongue-in-cheek side note* To those thinking that it's not worth spending the extra cash to buy a MacBook vs a PC, ask yourselves this question: is your time, and therefor life, worth wasting on a machine that is buggy and poorly designed, and as such a constant headache to use? If your life isn't worth much or you are a sadist, buy a pc. If you value your time and want to enjoy as much of it as you can, including those times you spend working at your computer, buy a Mac. :p", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hardware problems - must have warante", "Author": "Stan", "ReviewID": "RHPF1YSXIR2OA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Started out as a great product but after 1 year the power supply broke.

Amazon's independent vendor was iPowerResale, who did a TERRIFIC job. I opted to swap out the optical drive into a separate USB enclosure, move the 750GB hard drive in its place, and install a 500GB solid state drive as the main drive.
