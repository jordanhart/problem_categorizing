When I wanted my refund they didn't apologize for sending the wrong one. They must have thought I was an idiot. The hard drive was 120 gb not 500gb, it wasn't running that software, it was a completely different model number, not the computer pictured, the ram and ghz were different and the computer was severely chipped and dirty", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Apple Macbook 13\"", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1JPYZ7SZDWBUO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased mine about 6 weeks ago.  I have never owned an Apple product of any sort before, but have been buying new, inexpensive laptops about every 2-3 years and discarding them after they would become buggy or too slow. Many of my students have Apple laptops and claim that even a five-year-old Apple is better than a new non-Apple, so I'm testing that thesis.So far, so good with this one.  It arrived basically as advertised.  It has a new battery that provides about 4-5 hours of use.  The power cord is also new.  It has an older version of Office than the one I've been using, so that has taken some getting used to, but I'm figuring it out.  I may upgrade to a newer version of Office if I can find a cheap download.It operates nicely.  It starts up almost instantly from sleep mode, and takes about a minute from a full restart.  It occasionally downloads software updates, and does so pretty seamlessly.Two quibbles.  It came with a 1\" scratch on the screen.  I purchased the Displex scratch remover to try to remove it but no luck.  It is not so noticeable with a dark background but with a light background it is annoying, though not obtrusive.  The other problem is the DVD player.  I popped in a copy of \"The Chipmunks Movie\" and it won't pop back out.  I've checked out YouTube videos and other forms of online advice on this problem and nothing works.  This is not a big deal since DVDs are basically obsolete technology, but it is just annoying.So my bottom line is this.  If you have $1100 + tax to spend, go for the new model.  If you are like me and don't want to spend more than about $500 on a laptop, then this could be a good option.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Buy for the Money", "Author": "Allen Ferreira", "ReviewID": "R2Z81NM26OMKZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Good:Fairly PricedFast DeliveryUpdated Nicely (RAM and HD)Functions WonderfullyKeyboard is in Mint ConditionCharger seemed to be brand newAll functions work properly (trackpad, Keyboard, disc drive)Runs Cool (monitored with Temperature Monitor over an extended period)Upgradeable to OS X LionThe Bad:Arrived pretty dirty (not common, especially from a company that specializes in refurbishing computers)Minor Scratching to the Top outside Panel (only noticeable when tilted and in certain lighting)Slight Damage to outside rear left corner (causes left corner to sit slightly crooked when closed)Small Chip in trackpad buttonArrived powered on (could have overheated during delivery inside of box; although not likely)CD Drive although functional, is a little loud when powering on or when entering disc (I have a mid 2012 macbook pro and I realize that the noise is normal, however this is moderatley louder and may need to be replaced soon)The macbook was well worth the money that I shelled out for it. It is an overall great buy for just about anyone doing light to moderate computer work or gaming. Fast and Responsive. I will say that I almost gave it 4 stars based on the fact that it didn't come in the condition I was expecting from a computer refurbishing company. Decided to give it 5 stars based on the product itself. I will update this review within a few months with any new information.

I tend to comment on products weather they are good or bad. First of all, I like this product. It is very nice and a good buy. I got more than I expected in that It was sold as a 2.16Ghz intel core 2 duo. I instead got a 2.40 Ghz intel Core 2 duo. I also was upgraded to an intel GMA x3100 integrated video versus the GMA 950. These were good upgrades and very appreciated. Now, the bad. It was packed to be shipped to me in Afghanistan (I am deployed) in a medium flat rate box wrapped in bubble wrap. Thank goodness this is a very sturdy laptop. It did survive. They also showed a video adapter and a mini mouse. I got neither. All in all I got a good Mac for a good price. I just think that there should have been a little more forethought in the packing and overall quality control before shipment.*Update* The seller has contacted me and notified me that they will be shipping the missing items. All in all I am enjoying my Mac very much and have no complaints. I am taking the seller at their word and upgrading one star for service after the sale. The packing still left a bit to be desired. Thanks to the seller for the quick response. I will certainly do business with them again!", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nervous about buying used", "Author": "new ny mom", "ReviewID": "R397RNBI9HZZ6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was nervous about buying a used computer, but am thrilled I did.

The 500 GBs allow me to add or update more to the programs without having to worry about space needed.  The computer is clean and the keys are all functional.  I did not receive the mouse pad and the GVA component as stated in the deal, but the computer itself is a very clean outside with minor scratches as said, but it runs and works perfect.

Given wholesale discounts, it would seem reasonable for all sellers to just stick a copy of necessary software on each laptop.Of course, Apple stock is through the roof and they unbundle everything as a religion.  Why is it my iphone needs an rubberized Ironman suit complete with the Stark circle of light to function in the world?  My old phone lasted 7 years with no case and was fine.  Why proprietary headphones?
