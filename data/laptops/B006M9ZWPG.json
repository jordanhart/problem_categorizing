It comes loaded with Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit and I was also delighted to find out that there wasn't much bloatware but definitely enough to warrant a clean wipe. I then installed a fresh copy of Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. It handles basics tasks without breaking a sweat and can even run many current games, like Diablo 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic, at mid to high advanced settings with a maximum resolution of 1366x768.Current Windows Experience Index:Processor: 6.7RAM: 7.3 (@ 8 GB)Graphics: 5.9Gaming Graphics: 6.5Primary HD: 7.1It's very lightweight for its size and seems sturdy enough, although I'd feel safer with it in a case even when at home. The attractive gun metal grey finish rounds out a great package. Definitely a great buy for a mid level entertainment laptop if you're looking for one at a sub-$500 price range.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "A great Ideapad for Z money", "Author": "Ash Nazg", "ReviewID": "R3BSJINSJKH911", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this AMD-based Ideapad because it seemed that folks thought its Intel counterpart was problematic.  I'm not the least bit disappointed.  I needed a basic laptop with moderate horsepower.  I replaced the OS with my copy of Windows 7 Pro and it's a fairly fast machine, I won't need more than its 4GB of RAM or an SSD drive.  I use a fast 32GB SD card for Microsoft's ReadyBoost feature but I'm not sure this laptop even needs that.  I use it mostly for web surfing and remote sessions to my more powerful computers downstairs, but like to watch videos every now and then too.  As many have noted, the sound is adequate but could be improved, however I'm hard of hearing and usually use headphones anyway.  The touchpad is textured but it's not distracting, and it's positive and accurate.  I do miss a middle button -- this rig has a single button bar below the touchpad that acts sort of like a rocker for right and left clicks.  Seems strange but it works fine.  Very minor complaints for an otherwise excellent computer, I certainly think my money was well-spent.", "Date": "May 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "BUY THIS LAPTOP ..GREAT VALUE AND FANTASTIC PERFORMANCE!!!", "Author": "Johnny C. \"Johnny\"", "ReviewID": "RQUEHI5X2SY3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "High Performance and best value all in one on this Lenovo Z575 Laptop.

Im amazed considering how cheap this laptop is! I played the games as vannila as the computer was out of the box, so no overclocking, modding, etc. The fans do a great job, keeping the computer at a just below warm temperature when gaming, and cool when browsing/ doing light loads on cpu. Don't let the 1.5 ghz scare ya, you can still overclock since the computer came unlocked. Laptop came 1 day early, Monday, when it was supposed to come Tuesday. Amazons shipping is great, fast, and efficient. I highly recommend it!", "Date": "June 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice machine", "Author": "Psy Atty", "ReviewID": "RZMI0P35V6864", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this used for $300 on ebay about 6 months ago.  Upgraded to 8 gig ram.  Runs fine.  Can play World of Tanks online.  Has about 2 hours of battery life.  Two minor problems.  When I unplug the ac, the laptop many times freezes.  Also many times the laptop does not turn off when I try to shut it down, and I have to be careful to not \"hotbox\" it.  However, just holding down the on button will do a force shutdown.", "Date": "October 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good price for an okay laptop", "Author": "tablo", "ReviewID": "R13WW4D3I4BBT1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The laptop is okay. Drivers are way out of date and you need to mess around with the gpu driver a good bit to get semi-decent performance. The graphics switching is a pain. I recommend disabling it. Also the lights on the laptop do not turn off and can be an annoyance when watching movies/tv on it. Otherwise it is a solid device at a decent price. Still probably not worth buying in 2013.

I hadn't heard of Lenovo before I got this computer, and I was surprised to hear that it got such good reviews. The computer is lightweight and made from quality parts. And it's cheap! Before you buy, know what you're going to use this for. This is not a gaming laptop for sure. I've gotten into gaming lately, and I have to turn graphics down to medium settings to get decent frame rates. It can run pretty much anything before 2009 on full graphics. The processor is relatively slow, but it is quad core, so it performs well with programs that utilize multiple CPUs. RAM is a decent 4GB. I upgraded to 8GB for a cheap $20. The graphics card is just good enough to get by. The screen is LCD 1366x768, so it's high definition, just a bit over 720p. Full HD is 1920x1080, but if you are picky enough to want a perfect display, you can fork over a couple thousand dollars for a macbook (boo!) And of course Windows 7 is (in my opinion) the best OS ever made. Never had a blue screen, never an unfixable registry error, never a virus, not even a single crash. And it has stayed consistent with it's speed. The only thing that I don't care for is battery life. It started off great, but within a month, I was getting 2 hours with the light turned completely down, all background programs closed, bluetooth and wifi off, and only running microsoft works. I would use it to take notes in school, and the battery would barely be alive by the end of the 2 hour lectures. And whenever I'm on a coast to coast flight, I transfer a few movies to my iPod, so I have backup entertainment after the computer hits 30% battery life after the 90 minute movie. I mainly have this plugged in now.What this computer is great at... well, everything but gaming. It fast and smooth, nice keyboard, nice screen, aesthetically pleasing. What I use this most for is internet and movies. My entire movie collection is on my hard drive, and movies look and sound fantastic. I have some bluray quality, so I don't get the full HD experience, but the HDMI solves that problem. I can plug it right into an HDTV and get a beautiful picture. I can tell that I will be using this for another 2 years at least. It does everything I intended for it, but since I'm starting to get into high-performance software, I need to get high-performance hardware. And at the this point, I'm very hesitant to throw down a couple thousand on a powerful system, so I'll just stick with this and put off more powerful games until I build my own computer in a few years.And before I forget, the price is incredible!", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006M9ZWPG"}}
