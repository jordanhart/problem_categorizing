This laptop is a little smaller than other laptops, So far so good no compliments, I like it, since I don't do much on it, other than check email, and look for stuff on the internet, the screen is a little small my other computer compaq is a little bigger than this, the price was right, and in my range so that is why I bought it....If you don't use the computer that much and use it just for home purposes, like I do then I would suggest to purchase one of these Elitebook notebook... If you need one for work, then I would say purchase a bigger Laptop with more memory & ram...  So I am happy with my new HP Elitebook Notebook, The only problem it does not have is the 10-key on the right hand side, especially when I am used to using one...", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Processor - Intel i5 2400 MHz || Memory Installed - 4096mb DDR3 > Upgradeable to 8192MB\nHard Drive - 250Gig Serial ATA || Optical Drive - DVD-RW || Screen Size - 14.0\" WideScreen LCD\nInternet Connection(s) - The installed 802 11 ABG WI-FI card will allow you to connect to any available wireless network, and the internal Ethernet port will allow a high speed wired connection\nSoftware Installed - NEW Windows 7 Home Premium 32 Bit, word document & spreadsheet applications, shortcut to Microsofts free virus protection along with a restore partition on the hard drive for easy reinstallation.
