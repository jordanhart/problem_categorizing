{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This computer is absolutely worth the money.", "Author": "Steve M", "ReviewID": "R33GRUBR146DBL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Thank you for taking the time to read these few statements. I am so glad I bought this machine.First off it is built extremely well. The touch screen is very responsive as are the keyboard keys and touch pad. The touchpad gestures for scrolling work amazing. The beats audio subtle flare is a nice touch with the red trim around the keyboard, The speakers sound amazing and probably the best speakers I've ever heard on a laptop. The fingerprint scanner actually works really well and I can use it to sign into gmail, facebook, reddit, Pandora, etc. I even tested it being the skeptic I am, first with other fingers (it's set to my right pointer finger so you know which one to cut off to gain access) and then by having someone else put there fingers on there. No go! Only the one print on the one finger worked. The keyboard is a bit flexy when typing but I don't see this being a problem and I don't actually notice it at all when typing. This thing is actually pretty light and SUPER thin. It's definitely a very nice looking machine and it's been fun showing it off. WIndows 8 makes more sense with a touch screen and i'm getting used to it.For you gamers like me, so far so good. I mainly play MMO type games and so far have tried league of legends, guild wars 2 and world of warcraft. All of which work without a hitch. With Nvidia experience it will even optimize your games graphics settings and automatically set it to run as good as possible. I've had no lag in any of the above games and with the processor being as fast as it is alt tabbing is super fast with games open. Load times seem very snappy and the graphics look clean and in high definition.For you media junkies. This thing can process media just fine. I run photoshop CS6 which is a pretty cpu intensive program and it handles it without even showing any stress at all. It's been a  pleasure to work on this computer. I'd imagine video editing would be a breeze. It also runs my PCDJ program great and without any lag.The funny thing is I've never bought a \"name brand\" computer before such as HP. I used to be a bit snobby when it came to pc's and only purchased pc's built in local computer shops by the wonderful nerds who's passion in life was computers (I know how that sounds, it's ridiculous but it's awesome). I moved to Alaska for work about 5 months ago and only was able to pack my clothes. I've been replacing my electronics from back home with new shiny ones and decided to give this computer a shot after reading the specs here on amazon. Honestly, I am absolutely floored with this thing and couldn't be happier. I decided not to make a pros/cons list because so far there really are no cons I can find.

It was a combination that proved impossible, largely because very few laptops designed with gaming in mind have touch screens right now. My experience with the iPad had convinced me that a touch screen was really valuable in a portable device, since you don't always have a surface for a mouse, and the touch screen worked so much better than trackpad. Eventually I decided to give up on light weight and keep the touch screen and GPU requirements, and the HP Envy 15 is one of very few laptops that has both.It's not normally available with a large SSD. It has a slot for a mSata card, so it's possible to have both a mSata SSD and a normal hard disk, but HP in its benighted unwisdom only sells it with a 20 GB mSata SSD designed to cache the main 1 TB hard disk. You can find some third-party resellers that upgrade the mSata slot to something more reasonable. Personally, I installed a 256 GB Plextor mSata drive to act as the OS and software drive, and kept the 1 TB hard drive for data.That is where my regrets began. On any normal laptop this would be a trivial process, but for some idiotic reason HP has chosen to install a crippled BIOS that cannot specify the boot order of installed drives. You can specify that an external CD boots first, or a USB drive, but you can't say \"SATA slot 1 boots before 0.\" This is common, basic functionality in almost every desktop and laptop made today, and they ripped it out. After much research I learned how to build EFI BootRec files that would boot from the mSata drive instead of the hard disk. It works, and it's not difficult to do, but it's something that should have been available in the BIOS, and the proper procedure is cryptic even if it's easy.Real battery life is about 4, maybe 4.5 hours. I was expecting good battery life from a Haswell laptop as long as I wasn't using the graphics card or anything CPU intensive, but for simple tasks like web browsing or reading a book, 4.5 hours is what I actually get. You can definitely do better in this area.The screen contrast is poor. This is honestly the first time I can recall noticing this in a display. Photos I normally use as wallpaper and which look great on my desktop monitor look horribly washed out. Calibrating the displayed helped some, but this is _not_ a good screen.HP installs some fairly irritating software on the laptop. For example, fairly often if something bumps the AC power connector, I'll get a popup telling me about alternative, more powerful AC adapters I can purchase from HP. I don't ever want my laptop to interrupt what I'm doing in order to display an ad.The final problem, the one that really upset me, isn't a problem with this laptop. It's Windows 8 (now 8.1) and the software available for it. It's just not acceptable with a touch screen. It works fine with a mouse, but after using iOS for years on my iPod and iPad, this is awful. Windows 8.1 has all sorts of poor design decisions, some of which you can address with third party software, but the real issue is that most Windows software behaves very poorly on a touchscreen. Even basic stuff like web browsers doesn't work very well. Stuff that's somewhat painful on an iPad like selecting text is nearly impossible with Windows 8.The upshot is that if you're looking at the HP Envy 15 for the same reasons I was, don't. The touch screen isn't worth it. Go get a regular gaming laptop, preferably one that's lighter weight and can handle a SSD gracefully. As long as you're willing to forgo the touchscreen, there are lots of better, usually cheaper alternatives out there.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great hardware with ugly software", "Author": "Fernando C Ferreira", "ReviewID": "R29O4OB16DSFR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The HP Envy is a good piece of hardware as prior versions have been.
