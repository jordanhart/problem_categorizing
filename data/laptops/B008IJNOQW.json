{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Really good for college or office", "Author": "Frenand", "ReviewID": "R2M58UL53UANH9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I haven't had this machine for more than a couple of weeks, but so far I am pretty satisfied. It is a powerful, light computer. I take it to classes and I don't need to carry the AC adapter because the battery lasts well over 6 hours while in power saving mode. The keyboard is responsive and backlit with several brightness settings. The machine itself feels nice and solid, very professional looking. With 1TB HDD, 8GB RAM and quad i7 processor, it seems that it would have a long life for office and normal college use.Something that I didn't see in the tech specs is the fact that it also has nvidia GT 630m 512MB GDDR5. Which means that it is not a gaming laptop, but it has decent gaming capabilities. Dead Space 2 runs at 30fps (max rate possible with vsync on) with everything, res set at 1366x768, AA without needing peak performance from gpu. A more graphically intense game like Just Cause 2, runs at 30 fps with settings set at mid-high (low for shadows though...) and no AA, but it uses all of the gpu's \"strength\" (see 70 degrees Celsius against Dead Space 2 gpu temp at 60).Overall it is a solid, versatile machine. For those that are looking for a good laptop for college, this is it. As light as a Mac but way less expensive while still being a high quality piece of equipment.Pros: Lightweight, fast processor, high storage capacity, decent gpu.Cons: Comes with a lot of bloatware, wish Samsung opted for gt 650m, just saying.Other: Try looking for it at a Best Buy, got mine there at 999.99 with Webroot Antivirus for free.", "Date": "August 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love mine, I love it...", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R1ASA0YASL2OUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've owned this laptop for at least 6 months now... I think it might even be closer to a year.Pros:It's fast, real fast.Lighted keyboard is handyIt's like having a macbook pro at 1/4 the price... especially now since the price has dropped.  I still feel like this laptop is worth more than they're currently selling for.I went ahead and bought a 256gb samsung SSD and a CD slide drive converter for the cd bay and installed that SSD with the 1TB drive where the CD drive used to be (I don't really need a CD/DVD drive).  and let me tell ya, this laptop is super fast.  It boots right into windows now in around 10 sec.  Installing the SSD wasn't too hard either, if your tech savy enough you'll be fine and there was a decent youtube video on it.Cons:The trackpad is the most annoying thing about this latop... I appreciate the multifinger gesture support but it's huge and often resting my hands to type I end up hitting the thing.  I just use a wireless mouse anyway and you can disable it with a fn button command in like 2 seconds so no big deal.The microphone was placed in the worst spot imaginable... It must be next to the cooling fan so when that thing kicks on your friends will hate you.  Also, if you rest your left arm for using the keyboard it covers it up!  I mean.. really?  Way to think that one though samsung.Anyway, I'd much rather take those two cons over spending 1000$ bucks to get a MBP.  My buddy has a mac with similar stats he spent much more money on and our two computers perform nearly the same in game, photoshop, etc.I'd buy it again no problem.  The SSD really helps make this thing even more beastly, I recommend getting one put in if your going to buy.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beyond Love this Laptop", "Author": "Lisa A. Brighton \"Lisa Brighton\"", "ReviewID": "R2X2ZBM02VKZT9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did NOT want to get another HP or Toshiba.  Both have lasted less than 2 years and there wasn't anything particularly good about them.  This laptop with its Intel  Core i7 processor is a speed demon.  I was reluctant to get a refurbished machine but I love the light-up key board.  My Mom was so impressed with it she is going to get one.  Do think twice before you get a system with Windows 8; I bought one through Staples and at the 3 1/2 week mark I gave up.  The learning curve was too much and after 25 years of being computer literate all of a sudden I felt like I had sat down to a computer for the first time.  I did not have the time to go back and take classes... so I opted to get a Windows 7 refurbished and I couldn't be happier.  Do yourself a favor and go through this vendor you won't be sorry.  They made reference to some imperfections which made me a bit hesitant but I didn't even notice them when the system arrived.  I just couldn't be more happy with this system.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Samsung Laptop", "Author": "Sherrie Los", "ReviewID": "R3ERYMZPHRDH3S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop was great ...at first.....white spot on screen after 4 months of use.  Also imprint of keys is permenantly on screen.  After having this laptop 4 months I was ready to replace it (I replace my laptop once a year) Now having the screen/keyboard issues only progress I will be having to purchase a new laptop earlier than anticipated.  I will not be buying another Samsung.  It is still under warranty but I cant afford to be without a computer while it gets shipped off, fixed, and sent back to me.  I bought this laptop to use for work, not as a backup computer.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Phenomenal", "Author": "Will Shoemaker", "ReviewID": "R25I6PH85E5IC7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is absolutely awesome. I completely love it. Fast, beautiful, and FAST.What would I change: It has 8GB ram and a chipset that supports 16, but 4GB of the RAM is integrated into the motherboard and not upgradeable. So 12 is the max. Lame.It is a mild pain to swap the hdd, and one I did, it has always been a creaky and loud sounding laptop. The plastic just seems cheap on that bottom plate.Anyway, I would buy it over again in an instant. Especially since the prices came down SO MUCH.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008IJNOQW"}}
