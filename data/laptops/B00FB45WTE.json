SONY DOES NOT HAVE ROBUST TECHNOLOGY FOR THIS FEATURE. If you want to be frustrated, delayed, and waste huge amounts of time, USE the face recognition.  I have spent up to 30 minutes trying to logon.  Further, it can be a long journey to try and figure out how to turn it off......I haven't found out how yet.  You search the internet and the resources twist all over the place but never get directly to the process/task.  I live in a modern apartment with acceptable lighting.  The screen gives several excuses for failing to recognize my face before it switches to saving a \"new face\", and it's just not acceptable.  I logon to get things done, not wrestle with getting access.  The angle of the screen is adverse to the face-recognition process, and if you need lights on in the room, or there's daylight coming in from one part of the room.....forget it....the lighting is inadequate.  I have a rather long password (15 characters) and by the time I get it entered, the computer is back to looking for a face.  A real bummer!  It's a holiday where I'm writing from at the moment, and I have to give up on the Sony PC and work on my MacBook Pro to write and work.  A real waste of valuable time.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, but has room for improvement!", "Author": "N. Tran", "ReviewID": "R31GZNBN548L3K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I own the Sony Vaio Duo 13 with i7-4650, 8GB RAM, 512GB SSD and Windows 8 Pro. It is an impressive convertible ultrabook.Build:The device feels very solid and has a premium feel.- The left and right edges of the screen bezel has a slight lip near the middle that catches your fingernail (it's not perfectly flush).- There are two hooks on the base that attaches to the bottom of the screen to keep it secured when the screen is up, but the hooks can sometimes miss and the screen needs to be realigned. If the Duo is on a 45-degree or more slant then the screen will become unhooked and hang loose.- This ultrabook does not have a lock hole.Weight:The Duo 13 is lightweight for a laptop but not light enough for one-handed use as a tablet.Screen:Beautiful IPS display.- The screen can be hard to view in direct sunlight.- The screen is great, although a 60-degree angle (like the MS Surface) instead of 45 would be better. The IPS display has decent viewing angles so I can live with that.- The sliding screen design allows the screen to be closer within reach than traditional laptops. I like this design over others where the screen is further at the edge of the base.- Having the screen on top and slide out has its benefits to be used as a tablet/slate without having the keyboard in the way. This was one of the main reasons why I chose the Duo over the Pro.- It would be nice if the screen can somehow flip out of the way if you didn't need it. All I need is the keyboard when connected to an external display and the blank screen is just in the way.- Other ultrabooks may have higher resolution screens but 1080p seems sufficient for this 13\" screen. The screen magnification is set to 125% by default, which still allows a large workspace. Setting it to 100% gives you a very ample workspace but items can be too small.- The touch accuracy works as intended, but it can get tricky to pinpoint some buttons in desktop mode with your finger. This is where the pen comes in handy.- Note that this screen only has 5 touch points instead of 10, but I haven't found the use for that many touch points. Windows 8 doesn't allow you to drag multiple items with multiple fingers anyways.- I had the Duo custom built at Sony's online store and had them apply the screen protector at the factory. The screen protector does takes away some glare, glossiness, and color.- Note that output displays are limited to 1080p. I wish it could go higher for my higher resolution monitors.- It has a flat surface for use with Windows edge gestures.Keyboard:The keyboard could be larger with more key travel.- The keys are very well spaced and I can type at full speed. Most of my typing errors are from missing the right Shift key and pressing Up on accident.- My main gripe is that the right Shift key is too small. I find myself frequently pressing Up instead of Shift with my right pinky finger on accident.- The key travel is very shallow and takes some getting used to.Trackpad:It's small but does the job.- The trackpad does the job but I rarely use it. I cranked the sensitivity up so it is more usable.- It's easy to accidentally tap the touchpad while typing so care is needed while typing. Good thing Sony included a hot key to disable the trackpad (Fn + F1).- The left half left-clicks and the right will right-click.- Gestures work just fine with the Synaptics drivers and can be customized.- The pen does not work on the trackpad.Pen:The pen works as intended. It comes in handy for accurate pointing but I can live without it.- It feels nice and solid but could be more comfortable.- The top half of the pen where the clip meets already broke loose, as if the super glue no longer sticks.- It is not a Wacom pen so limited apps can use the sensitivity feature at the moment.- The clip holder snaps into place and is much better than having nothing to hold the pen. If it weren't for the clip holder then I would probably leave the pen at home.- The \"ink well\" holder is built in and slides out when needed, but I rarely use it.Cameras:Mediocre cameras on front and back.- The front camera is not adjusted to account for the 45-degree angle screen. If the screen is up then the camera will also be looking up 45-degrees.- Included is a FastAccess Facial Recognition app to log in, but it is pretty slow at recognizing faces.Connectivity:- The USB ports on the back are somewhat out of reach, especially when the screen is propped up. It would be better if they were on the side, however, it's nice that all the wires are routed on the back.- No wifi issues here. The wifi signal is stronger when the screen is propped up.- Bluetooth works as intended.- I haven't tried Intel Wireless Display but look forward to testing that out since it's built in.Performance:This ultrabook is no slouch!- The SSD allows for fast boot times as well as quick read/write times. It'll boot up in about 10 seconds and restart in about 20 seconds. It almost instantly wakes up when resuming from sleep.- The i7 CPU doesn't break a sweat when I push it.- The fan is not too loud (there's a setting in Vaio Control Center that allows you to adjust the fan noise and CPU performance).- The vent hasn't gotten hot, but the port side where the power plug can get warm when I'm charging it and running multiple USB displays off one port.Battery life:This was one of the main selling points for me. An advertised 10 hour battery life was unheard of until Haswell came out.- I can get about 4-5 hours using CPU intensive apps like Traktor to mix music at regular screen brightness and timeout settings. I can picture it lasting 6-8+ hours if I try to conserve power by lowering the screen brightness and shortening the display timeout/dimming settings. I have the display set to dim in 1 minute to 0% and it has helped with battery life.- The battery doesn't seem to drain when the laptop is in sleep mode so I just put it to sleep instead of shutting down.- It charges pretty quickly at about 1% per minute.--Conclusion:I like this convertible ultrabook very much and I can picture myself using it for years to come. I can recommend it to others.- It is overpriced but you get what you pay for (powerful CPU/GPU, good battery life, beautiful display, quick SSD [probably the most expensive part], solid and thin build). This is a premium ultrabook.- The battery life, screen, keyboard and weight could use some improvement to earn another star. If the battery could last 10 hours as advertised under normal use then that would be great. The screen would be better if it were adjustable or at a 60-degree angle. The keyboard is not the best but works for daily use. It could be lighter for one-handed use.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Computer - not a big fan of the OS", "Author": "Leon S", "ReviewID": "R2ZAW0ERWON5MI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Computer does what it's supposed to do though it takes me longer to get it done than on the old Windows XP OS.  I'm not a fan of this touch pad can't get it adjusted correctly it's too sensitive (I am very familiar with use as I've exclusively used one on my work notebooks for 6 years)  .  Getting used to the touch screen and am confident this will eventually be the big win I still go for the keyboard and touch pad before remembering to touch the screen.  Largest challenges have been with the Windows 8 OS.  Will get there eventually.  The OS I would rate 3.  The computer 5 hence the 4 rating.  Computer connection speed is very fast and monitor is very clear.  App's don't play well with other Microsoft programs, it's a bit like working in two totally separate OS.
