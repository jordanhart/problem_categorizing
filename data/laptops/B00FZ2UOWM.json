{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nice and Powerful machine.", "Author": "David Gibson", "ReviewID": "R3492UUSPT4GF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Machine was delivered quickly and without problems. I had hoped that it was the model which had Leap Motion, but the description was unclear about that feature. Nevertheless, The model that came was good - 16GB RAM, i7 4800M, 17\" touchscreen 1T storage. The machine is a beast - it's quick, quiet and with 16GB, it's capable of ably handling most tasks in a timely fashion. Windows 8 took some time to not rub me the wrong way and still hasn't completely stopped annoying me, but this is not a problem with the computer. In fact, had this been a machine without a touchscreen, I would have been in hell when trying to use Windows 8.My only complaint is that this machine is heavy and gets very hot. After a while, it being a laptop becomes either questionable or an exercise in torture. I'll say this, do not play any graphic intensive video game while having this device on your lap. It will iron new creases into parts of your body that never should have them.Other than that, I like this machine. The backlit keyboard is useful. The finger print scanner doesn't make me suicidal and the machine's aesthetic is quite nice. It will give you hours of good, clear use before you realise that the pleats in your pants are now on your legs.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Computer but Beware", "Author": "Cynthia B. Goodwin", "ReviewID": "R2ST0J8A7XDP26", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Like Mr. Eskildson I bought this computer directly from HP with the intent of upgrading to a SSD and using the Current HD as the \"D\" Drive.  Apparently HP has different ideas about this possibility.  I had a computer \"expert\"  install the SSD and transfer the files from the HD to the SSD.  There seems to be some sort of issue in the Registry that makes this very difficult.  He was able to get it done but it took many hours of trial and error to accomplish.Be aware if you decide to install a second hard drive of any sort, you will need rubber inserts to cushion the hard drive and a connecting cable to install the hard disk.  You Tube has an instructional video on this.I needed a powerful laptop so I purchased this version.  It is a great laptop but comes with large amounts of HP \"Bloatware\".  The initial set up of Windows 8.1 is much more difficult and confusing than in previous windows versions.  As Windows 8.1 is so difficult to maneuver through I have installed Windows 7 Classic Shell.  It makes the computer look and act like Windows 7 which is much preferable in my opinion.What would I do differently?  After much consideration I would buy the same computer but would trash the HP installed operating system.  I would buy a fresh copy of Windows 8, install the SSD as the \"C\" drive and the 1 TB HDD as the \"D\" drive and start fresh.  That way I could have the benefits of the equipment without the problems created by HP.  Of course I would be taking a chance with the warranty but this is a chance I would be willing to take.  Even with the extra cost of purchasing windows, it would be less than paying a person to solve all the issues related to installation and transfer of information.I am certainly no expert but assume this would work.  Overall a great computer but HP has complicated everything with its software and operating system.What have I learned?  That if buying a current high end laptop buy it as you want it configured and do not change it.  Live with the installed operating system or be prepared for a issues that are beyond the normal persons ability to overcome.  I have assembled my last two computers myself because of these issues and have been much happier.  Now I have learned my lesson with lap-tops.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful laptop with all I need for my work and my small business", "Author": "Raya", "ReviewID": "R1QD92MPRTEYJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"I'm very satisfied with the product and the seller.

Buy One Now!!", "Author": "ProFlex", "ReviewID": "R25S4EBET0WIQ6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought this exact laptop from [...] ($1,229.59 w/coupon code) but with 16GB of RAM and with 2 hard drives (750GB/ea) with the intention of replacing the main boot C:/ drive with the Samsung 840 EVO 500GB SSD.I needed a laptop that was portable and powerful to bring back and forth from Florence, Italy to La Jolla, Southern California and to South Florida and this is \"the\" one.Installing a SSD is not as easy as one would think - the Samsung EVO SSD comes with migration software to mirror your laptop's data to the new SSD via SATA III to USB 3.0 cable , BUT this is not the recommended way of file transfer. The way to do it is doing a Windows 8.1 install to the new SSD.The new laptops have their drives partitioned - One as C:/ drive and the other as D:/ drive on the same drive. On that D:/ partition there should be an Operation System recovery (basically: it's Windows 8.1) and this is what you would use to \"install\" the OS onto your new SSD.Oh. . . .  back to the laptop, just go and buy one, now!  :)", "Date": "January 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "BEWARE-DO NOT BUY THIS OR FROM HP IN GENERAL!", "Author": "Paul Zandarski", "ReviewID": "R2OX6CKS6AGQC7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this computer for LESS THAN 2 months...I got it for Christmas.  It has been NOTHING but problems from the first week I've had it.  It was an awesome computer, with all the fixings but the keyboard doesn't work like it should. I called tech support and they kept fixing the drivers, which I said wasn't the issue, and they kept saying it was. Then they'd \"lose\" my service ticket number and have to open up a new service ticket.  Then they'd say it was the driver's again and we'd repeat the same thing. When I turn it off and turn it back on, the keyboard works for about an hour and so, on the phone, it looked like it worked, when it just stopped the issue for a little while.  I've been calling almost weekly since I go it. I called Friday and they hung up on me 4 times.  Each time they were \"so sorry\" and then they'd hang up again.  Then I was put on hold for over an hour when I tried to get help.  Turns out, Friday was the last day of \"software\" warranty and now they won't help me or discuss anything on the phone without a $50 service fee.  The guy told me I created the problem because I admitted I've been to..wait for it, Facebook!  He gave me some scenario about buying a carton of eggs that were fine in the store but you get them in the car and now they're your own problem.  I was frustrated with this story and refusal to help and he replied with, \"you're already getting upset and I haven't even told you how much this will cost you yet.\"  Apparently it was not supposed to be a joke.  What is a joke is their customer service. He refused to put me in touch with a supervisor unless I paid the $50 to him first.  Is this how they run things at HP?  I got this laptop to replace my HP desktop...to replace it since that also had issues from the beginning.  So I paid all of this money, for what?  For their employees to take a crash course in \"blaming the customer\" and \"putting the customer off until they're out of warranty.\" This laptop is LESS than 2 months old and apparently they refuse to see it as a hardware problem (hello, it's THE KEYBOARD!) and are instead saying it's definitely a software which is out of warranty and I am to blame for visiting Facebook.  Well I plan to take to social media and all over the internet to warn my friends and family against this computer.  And this company in general.  How does a company this big lose all my service ticket numbers and hang up on me repeatedly until I'm officially out of the software warranty.  Please don't buy this.  Put your money into something else.
