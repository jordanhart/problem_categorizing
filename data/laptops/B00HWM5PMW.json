I was sorry to leave my familiar old XP desktop, but learning windows 8 isn't the chore i thought it would be. It Comes with Intel Core i7 Processor 8 GB DIMM RAM and 1 TB . Hard Drive. It also comes with a back lighted keyboard, DVD/CD drive and 3 USB slots and a Hdmi slot.  I feel I have the flexibility to do all I need. I'm sure I have a good investment .", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast processor, uncomfortable framing to rest your hands", "Author": "Gary", "ReviewID": "R35PKRAEYM7TCA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I enjoy the robust speed and quiet sound of the laptop. The speakers are ok, not great, not bad either. The keyboard is smooth and perfectly placed numeric keys, unlike Samsung laptops. However, the plastic framing is rough and kinda annoying. ITs sharp on the ends and you cannot rest your hands very long. Other than that, not bad at all.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Satellite S55-A5154 15.6-Inch Laptop", "Author": "Eduardo Quevedo", "ReviewID": "R1OQJZSRM3SYYR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a beautiful machine, just like in the pictures.

Podolec \"Podolec\"", "ReviewID": "R394LQJ76VM6RB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have only had it about a week and everything is running great. Fast boot time, good screen, reasonable benchmarks (Note this is performance not graphics. Because its integrated graphics it\u2019s almost pointless to benchmark them). The things I dislike are the DVD rom and the plastic chassis are way cheap.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice product", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Craig H.\"", "ReviewID": "R1RZZPHQ8E6FUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing laptop, it is sleek and has the processing power and ram needed to run software. The keyboard lights up and it looks very nice, not cheesy at all. It's not a touch screen but that is not a big deal. It does have some weight to it, it is not light like a tablet but not big and bulky either.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent!", "Author": "JCgt", "ReviewID": "R3D2OE2LLVQI43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent laptop.
