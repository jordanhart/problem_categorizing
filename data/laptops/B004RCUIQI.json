{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excelent value for the money", "Author": "SnowBreeze \"Tefi\"", "ReviewID": "R8OQO3PNRXMNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased an Iconia A501 for ~$550 here at Amazon. It came locked so I decided to stretch for ~$200 more and get a computer.I was comparing this with the HP ProBook 4530s - the big differences were - Docking station, SIM CARD slot and the i5 processor + Windows 7 Professional 64 bit.I have been working with this computer for ~5 months since I have one at work provided by the company.I love it. I have seen it perform very well using multiple resource hungry applications and it is fast.To my surprise, although the SIM card slot is there, when you open it up there is no SIM card reader installed - it is a separate module which could be acquired on eb** for ~$100.This applies only for the HP 8460p XU057UT . There are different part numbers/models (XU057UT) with different specifications and prices. So do your research before purchasingThese were my first impressions. Now in detail:The good:-I love the keyboard and the spacing between the keys.-The touchpad is big and it has a small golden \"spot\" which if you double tap, it disables the touchpad.-QuickWeb - This computer has a minimal OS built in one of the partitions which means that when the computer is shut down, if you touch the key between the wireless hardware switch and the mute button, it will start the computer with a linux based OS that is very fast and it gives you almost instant access to a web browser and skype. Yes, it allows you to connect wireless - that is how you get online. The quickweb button looks like a globe and in windows will open the default browser.-The aluminium case is nicely built and it feels nice,  looks elegant.-Windows 7 Professional 64 bit edition. You can install xp mode.-Camera is nice and it works fine.-Docking port on the bottom - I am using it with an external monitor and keyboard and occasionally take it with me on the road every now and then. The docking port will set you ~135 off here at amazon-The ability of installing an extra HDD in the Optical Drive bay.-Easy to open cover on the bottom for upgrades using the battery cover-Up to 8 Gigs of memory easy to install.Almost forgot to mention - this thing comes with a western digital 320 gb so if you plan on installing an SSD - my work computer has an SSD and the difference is huge.- so the software that comes with windows which you'd use to create a system image asks you for a hard drive equal in size or larger - an ssd 300 GB is ~$ 600 and up Or you can get a retail windows license and a smaller SSD. Probably System Builder disk/OEM win 7 would do you fine. note to note - if you install windows 7 from scratch or you format the hard drive and remove the partitions, you will lose the quickweb feature as it resides in the partition _HP Tools.-Comes with a lot bundled software - some of it useful some not so, depends on your needs - you can uninstall the one you do not need. I like the hard disk encryption and fingerprint reader plus the HP assistant will update all the drivers for you.-Counterstrike Source is playable with the integrated HD3000 Intel graphics if you lower the graphic settings. This does not mean you can get it for gaming. You can do very very light gaming.And the fan will start screaming and the laptop  will get warmer - not really hot on the right upper side of the keyboard where the chipset and processor are.-Sandybridge implementation: This baby has USB 3.0 ports. 3 of them and an esata port.-Has a DVD writer combo which is fine - the usual.-Onboard sound is ok.The bad:-The touchpad keys look like they are not lining up perfectly.-The screen is not so great but on the other hand is a matte screen.-The keyboard light does not provide enough light for you to see all the keys. Not a big deal to me as I touch type.-I still can't get over the fact that HP did not include some useful disk creation software that would not have this limitation(equal or larger HDD). Or create the installation disks for the OS.You get disks with the drivers and software they provide. Not the OS disc.I hope this review is useful to you.

The form factor is beautiful!  The keyboard redesign (over previous models) is perfection.  The brushed metal finish is wonderful and doesn't pick up fingerprints.

The 6930's were a joke and the 8440's made huge improvements but the 8460 definitely is the winner. Excellent battery life, solid processing performance and versatility make this a great machine to have. The island keyboard is by all means they way to go. Old EliteBook's could easily have keys ripped off by simply wiping the dust off. In the office I use mine in a docking station with dual 22in monitors and a wireless keyboard and mouse. At home its attached to a since 22in monitor, no docking station and just a wireless mouse. As a network engineer it gets the job done every time.

Very sturdy. Lots of metal parts. Nice web cam.Cons: The scratchpad is bulky and doesn't always cooperate (it likes to make the screen zoom in and out when you don't want it to). The laptop is very heavy and a little thick. No HDMI port... my 3 year old cheaper laptop included an HDMI port!  USB ports are hard to use. It is hard to open the CD drive because of the location of the button on a slanted curve. You pretty much have to pick the laptop up to open the CD drive.

However, HP really dropped the ball when it comes to usability with this laptop's design.KEYBOARD:HP put so much attention on creating a keyboard that fit a grid, that they totally ignored usability.  One of the key principles of design is to \"chunk\" things to make them easier to identify/remember/etc.  That's why phone numbers and social security numbers have hyphens in them; it's easier to remember three chunks of small numbers than one large number.  This is also why for as long as keyboards had function keys (F1 - F12), there were groups of four keys with a space between them.  This keyboard, however, has every single key right next to each other, violating the principle of chunking.  There's no space between the [Esc] and [F1], [F4] and [F5], or even between the arrow keys and the [Ctrl] key.  Everything is jammed into a grid, making it VERY difficult to feel for keys.  I've always touch-typed and now find myself having to look at the keyboard to read labels on keys.The arrow keys are laid out across three cells on the \"grid\", with the Up and Down keys jammed into a single cell -- that's right, the Up and Down are only half-size, jammed together in the space for a single key.  However, the Left and Right arrow keys are full-sized with a space between them and the Up/Down keys.  It's just plain AWKWARD!Typing on this reminds me of typing on an iPad -- it's okay for short messages, but you wouldn't want to write a book on it.CHASSIS:The chassis does seem durable and has a nice metal feel to it.  However, they did away with the rounded-over front edge below the keyboard.  So, type on it for a while and your wrists will have little sore marks from the sharp edge of the chassis.INDICATOR LIGHTS:I think HP swung the pendulum WAY too far to the other side with addressing customer feedback on LED indicator lights.  If you saw the predecessors to this laptop (the HP 8440P, etc.), you'd know that one of the customer complaints was the insanely bright LED indicator lights -- they would blind you while using the laptop.  So, HP took customer feedback and went to the other extreme!  The indicator lights ARE NOT VISIBLE!The indicator lights (power, HDD, WiFi, charge) are TINY little pinholes with tiny LED's behind them.  They are smaller than 0.5 mm!  The only way to see them is to position yourself directly inline with the LED and stare into the pinholes.  ABSOLUTELY USELESS!!!TOUCHPAD: (The only good thing)The touchpad is the only thing that seems to be done well.  It is over-sized (4\"x2\"), supports gestures (two fingers cause scroll, etc.), and can be easily disabled.  If you double-tap the tiny dot on the top-left corner of the touchpad, it disables the touchpad.  If you double-tap again, it re-enables it.  Also, your thumb won't affect the touchpad -- if you rest your thumb or slide it across the touchpad, the touchpad ignores it.  Nice for people who hate touchpads because of accidental movement with resting thumbs.  VERY NICELY DONE.SCREEN:The screen has a strong blueish-green cast to it without a lot of color fidelity.  I had to go into advanced settings and adjust the gamma settings to .7 and other color settings to get the right color fidelity.", "Date": "June 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very sturdy!", "Author": "remoteisland", "ReviewID": "RU7A2B6TGCVM4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a durable laptop, with a comfortable keyboard, and a matte screen. This laptop has it all! I spend hours on my laptop writing. This laptop does not hurt my eyes or my fingers. Its not the most modern looking laptop, but it is super sturdy. Its fast and the price was right. In fact, it was under my budget so I bought myself a new camera. I wish it had a backlit keyboard, but that wasn't a must. Overall, I am very pleased with the laptop.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good unit, but need something beefier", "Author": "kylejpatrick", "ReviewID": "R3UD8JEXQWRXK8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For a business notebook that's used to being driven down from heavy use and passed down over layers of management, this unit is surprisingly resilient!  But with today's applications, you might seek something beefier if you planning on running alot of programs.I am big on the feel of a notebook, and its design is nice.  Before this I had a Vista era Dell, and it felt plasticky and creekier than the inspiron I had had several years before it.  This has a brushed aluminum finish, which just feels more solid, which business users will appreciate, even if it's just in your head.  And I think you'll find it's not all just in your head.  It's been built around a lightweight metal skeleton that lends it rigidity and durability. If you believe HP's product testers, the 8440p should survive repeated drops from 30 inches, heat up to 160 degrees, dust, humidity, and up to 300 pounds of weight on the lid.  And get this, the keyboard even has a drain in the bottom to funnel spilled drinks away from the electronics and straight through the bottom. Everyone spills drinks, but I think it's safe to assume business users are even more prone, what with our lattes and limited desk spaces.This unit really excels at how many ports it has.  Besides the usual three USB ports, you'll find an additional eSATA/USB for faster devices, a FireWire port for compatibility with many Mac-centric accessories, an ExpressCard port for upgrades, an Ethernet jack and even a modem, god forbid. It has SD and other formatted cards, which many peripherals are doing these days. The front includes a standard SD/MMC card reader, and you'll find both analog VGA and digital DisplayPort outputs on the back for video.One cool little thing is an LED light above the monitor for nighttime situations.  It might not be the most powerful, but it does the job, and it's easy to find.  On other models that have an LED lit keyboard, you often have to locate it in the dark, to turn it on.  Which sort of defeats the purpose.The unit has both a traditional trackpad and the less popular \"nub\" buried in the center of the keyboard. Whenever possible I use a traditional mouse because of my role is very graphic/visual in nature, and I don't have time to mess with a trackpad.  It is multi-touch which makes scrolling so much easier when I need to though.Mine did not come with a webcam, so I can't speak to it, although I've read some reviews that have said the model on this one is exceptional, and doesn't look like the typical creepy guy broadcasting from another planet over dial-up.The 14.0-inch LCD on the EliteBook comes in a 1366 x 768 resolution - about average. It has a matte finish versus a glossy, so although not quite as bright and vibrant (but hey, it's a work machine), it delivers better overall usability in a variety of situations like offices to park benches, trains and airplanes. Best of all, it cranes 180 degrees.This unit comes equipped with an Intel Core i5 2.4GHz CPU, and while one day there was probably little that made it pause, I've found that by the software standards of today, I seem to start getting lag if I keep it powered on for a couple days.  I'm a graphics and web designer, so it's not uncommon for me to have Dreamweaver, Photoshop, Illustrator and Fireworks CS6 all open at the same time, in addition to the usual IE, word and excel.  It's safe to say I don't bloat it with cookies and registry modifications as I mostly use it at work.  So if you do purchase this model you might invest in extra memory.The Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD rather than a discrete GPU from Nvidia or ATI inside, it's nothing to hem and haw about, but as a work machine, it really doesn't need to be.  Even though I do what I do, I'm not typically doing anything \"motion\" related, so it's fine.One good thing is, this unit is largely ready to go out of the box, and free of bloatware.  Even alot of HP's own additions, which I've struggled with in the past with printers and camera's, have been filed away in a folder named HP.  Another handy feature is HP's Power Assistant utility. It makes it easy to uncheck extras like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth from one central control panel, and tells you how much you'll save with different settings. For example, did you know that switching off Wi-Fi only saves about a tenth of a watt, for instance, while jumping from \"mobile\" to \"high performance\" will rack on nearly an extra five. Still, it easily will shut off such features for you which I find alot easier than Windows' increasingly complex Control Panel.HP advertises battery life of up to six hours and 30 minutes, but I've never gotten that. Usually I'm lucky to stretch battery life over four hours, and with high performance, you're looking at more like three. Chances are the typical user isn't going to be away from a wall outlet that long, but I could see some international flights posing a problem.Not surprisingly, the speakers aren't that great.  But unless you're in your hotel room unpacking or cooking, you have no business using laptop speakers to listen to music anyway; you should be connecting it to a receiver or headphones.There are a couple other perks, like a fingerprint reader, and I always love HP's decision to have backlit icons next to the keyboard showing you  which options are activated, such as caps lock, wifi, and speaker controls.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Update sep-24-2012:  Adding one more star for fixes.", "Author": "Kevin Meade", "ReviewID": "RNEU110DEGOKS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update sep-24-2012:  Adding one more star for fixes.Some of the issues I originally had have not manifested for many months now.  Specifically I have not had any lockups on keyboard or mouse or mousepad.  Indeed I was able to have my people turn off the mouse pad (at least partially anyway) so it no longer interferes with my typing and editing of code.  I know my company has been downloading updates furiously over this time period.  I can only guess that some of these updates have fixed the issues I no longer have.  I still cannot get the sound to work correctly to mute the onboard mic but it does now appear to recognize when a headset or phones have been plugged in or removed and set its internal control settings properly which is an improvement.So overall, things are getting better.  That to me means +1 since this seems to be a product with some support over time.  A good thing if you are using it for businesss work.  Again good job HP.  What a surprise from a company that at one point had said it was remping down its participation in the laptop market.Update jan-20-2012:  Adding one star for durabilityI just dropped it.  More precisely as I walked away from my desk, my foot caught on a cord and pulled the laptop off my desk and onto a hard wooden floor.  This is a four foot drop.  The thing was on its face open; but the thump when it hit the floor was somwhat muted (although what do I know, this was the first time I ever dropped a laptop).  Knowing what I have seen from other people's laptops when they have dropped them I expected cracked screen or dead laptop, or non-functional keyboard and the like.BUT NOPE.  this thing is acting like nothing happened.  Sceen is fine, keyboard is fine, mouse is fine.  I will be checking all components thoughout the day as I use them but so far all is well.  This impresses me greatly.  I guess they really did harden this version of the laptop.  For this reason, this laptop would be good for those who are prone to bumping and dropping (students) and so I up the rating one star.  Good job on the hardening HP.-----------------------------------------------------------------Original Post:  Disappointment for three straight monthsI got the 8460p as part of an upgrade process at work where we upgraded all laptops over a certain age.  So far I have had nothing but trouble and see little of value.  Here are my complaints.1) I5 speed, not... it is slower than the laptop it is replacing.2) I5 multi-tasking.  Nope, not seeing that either.  Example: apps are slow to launch and you can't do anything till they finish launching.3) keyboard, most keys are fine for typing, but some dummy designer decided it was a good idea to put a special function key on the lower rung getting it to fit by making the up/down arrow keys be half size.  Not very good for someone who writes computer code and thus does some heavy text editing.4) keyboard.  Once a week this keyboard completely locks up.  The only solution is to turn off the computer and then turn it back on.5) mouse pad, like most mouse pads stink.  This one continuously interfers with editing causing the mouse to jump to unknown places in a document.6) audio.  The sound system has multiple problems.  It sometimes goes out just like the keyboard with the same solution of off/on (not restart, actual off/on).  Also, the audio won't keep its settings for my mic.  It keeps reverting back to the onboard mic forcing me to continuously have to reset the audio to use my headset mic.  This is a real bother for us remote workers who rely on teleconferencing to attend meetings.7) Screen.  The screen is very hash on the eyes.  No amount of fiddling with screen settings has helped either.If I had my choice, I'd ask for my old laptop back.  Too bad, I was looking forward to a faster more versatile machine.  Guess I'll have to keep calling the help desk till they get tired of me.  I wonder who decided on this machine for a corporate standard and why?  I am told by my buddies in tech support that I am not the only one with problems.Hail Flavius!", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i5 Processor 2.3GHz\n4GB DDR3 RAM\n320GB Hard Drive\n14-Inch Screen\nWindows 7 Professional", "Name": "HP EliteBook 8460p XU057UT 14.0\" LED Notebook - Core i5 i5-2410M 2.30GHz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41%2BJRJxTZsL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004RCUIQI"}}
