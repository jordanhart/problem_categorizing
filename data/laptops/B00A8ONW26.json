{"Reviews": [{"Title": "ALMOST perfect...", "Author": "Ayrsayle", "ReviewID": "REXMPSXIBME6U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased one of these as a gift to myself and replacement for a 2006 Macbook that finally gave up the ghost last year. I was leery of the Windows 8 OS but the fact that it had a dedicated NVidia graphics card, 8 GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive made it look like a pretty good deal. After all, I can always downgrade the OS if I want.So far I haven't been disappointed (much). Pros:1) Runs games up to Bioshock Infinite like a boss, framerate drops a little when it gets really busy but otherwise it's practically a desktop gaming rig away from home.2) Same thing for video (like Netflix and HD movie files).3) Windows 8 isn't bad on this thing once you install something like Classic Shell to get back to a Win7 look and do a little tweaking - your mileage may vary on whether that's acceptable or not. Haven't run into any incompatibility issues yet even on some of my old software favorites.4) Plenty of storage space, even after installing a pile of multi-GB games.5) Auto-loading optical drive and multi-touch keyboard give it a Macbook feel. I just wish it had a similar breakaway power cord.6) Looks pretty. Not usually a consideration, but hey, gotta give it props for not looking like (or being) a cheap piece of plastic. EDIT: It still is plastic, though. (edit 1/7/14)Now for the cons (the reason I don't give it a full five stars):1) No VGA port. Yes, HDMI is great, but if you're plugging it to a 720p tv, it's going to overscan no matter how much you plead with it. There's adapters but c'mon, this isn't some tablet or netbook you need to conserve plug space on.2) Network port has a weird flipdown partial cover. Looks like it's just begging to break off.3) The mic is on the keyboard section to the left of the touchpad. The hole and the mic icon look like a blemish and if you're trying to use a voice app like Skype and typing at the same time it's hard to keep from putting your hand down on it. Very awkward.4) The power cord is on the side and sticks straight out. Also awkward. Everything else I can understand putting on the left or right, but they should have at least made it one of those right-angle plugs so it doesn't feel like it's going to break the plug or yank the laptop out of your hands if someone trips over it.5) Windows 8. Yes, as I said above, not so bad once you've tweaked it. But this thing is not a tablet or touchscreen and doesn't really benefit from having an OS that defaults to a touch interface.6) No Blu Ray. C'mon, guys, you're going to build this with everything else cutting edge, making the optical drive a Blu Ray wouldn't have killed you.7) The hard drive appears to be a 5400 SATA-2 drive. So it's spacious but 7200 RPM SATA-3s are cheap and faster.(added on 1/7/14)Most of these cons are minor quibbles compared to the pros, so overall I'm very satisfied considering the price was under 1K.", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Honest Opinions", "Author": "Sam Hiced \"Beats-Boy\"", "ReviewID": "R3OUCU7I7NYTUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for about a month now. I'm going to be brutally honest about it.Here is what I like-I LOVE the lighted keyboard Probably my favorite feature-I love the light weight-I love how it looks-I love the heavy hitting ram and great processor-I love how it turns on when I open it up. Simple feature, yes. Still, who cares its mad cool!-I love the improved battery life over my old laptop-The speakers, they are VERY good. I promise you, as a person who produces music, for a latpo you cannot really get all that much betterThings that I do not like-The charger. My old Sony charger had a way better design and was longer-The trackpad. I get it, one big trackpad is what's in. If it works like a Mac, that would be great. But it does not quite work that good-The charger, I know, I know. I already said this but I think its a HUGE deal for people who carry their laptop all over. Samsung could have done better.For the over all deal though, GET THIS PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY!!I think its great for the price. No kidding. I love opening it up every morning.If I had to redo my my buying experiences all over again for the same price, I would buy the SAME thing.Cheers", "Date": "May 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great.

The 8Gb flash drive gives the 1Tb hard drive a zippy response  that makes it a real pleasure to use. The keyboard layout is sensible and feels right. The keystroke is a little shallow but that's a small quibble. I'm sure there's more to know but so far so good.

I wanted the option of getting in some ones face IF there was a problem. I am happy to say this has not happened, and I am very impressed with this computer. I am still adjusting to Windows 8, but this is the OS windows offers, so may as well get use to it. The boot time is incredibly fast, battery life is great.

No seriously.", "Author": "Steven Matos", "ReviewID": "RGAEXZEHHN1M6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a lot of Laptops in the past 4 years. (Dell XPS15, Lattitudes, HP's, Compaq's, Etc) NONE OF THEM can compare to the Samsung Series 7.Pros:Quiet, Light weight, sleek, light up keys for the dark, HD screen, lots of customization features, Excellent graphics, 1 TB (Lots of room for videos, pictures, etc) AWESOME battery life.Cons: The charger is on the side ( not a big deal but just uncomfortable sometimes)The mouse pad will take some getting used to. Its not about drivers or anything but there is no clear division of right click and left click so your fingers will seem clumsy.If you can get a wireless mouse to avoid the mouse then you are golden. I love this laptop. If you are browsing the internet the battery life can easily extend up to 7-8 hours. Playing video's about 5 hours, graphic intensive games maybe 3. The light weight portability of it makes it great for classes or taking notes in a meeting. The sleek body will for sure turn heads.I wasn't a big fan of Windows 8.1 till i used this laptop. They work well together and makes windows easy to use. The 2.7 i7 processor makes anything lighting fast. (If you want a performance boost consider a SSD drive i currently have an SD card that boost load up and it cut down start up time in half. About 30 seconds.)Overall - i couldn't ask for a better laptop. Well worth the money.

This machine is hands down one of the best laptops I've ever had. Its fast, its light for the performance specs, it has a real graphics card that runs Steam games great- even over the HDMI out to a tv without any goofy lag. Backlit keyboard- and did I mention the hyperthreaded 4-core i7 is fast? It will run itself up to 3.2Ghz in high perf power mode under heavy load. This laptop ranks up there with my old overclocked 4Ghz desktop.Cons- as mentioned by others, the mic port by the keyboard sucks. You can't video conference without a headset and type at the same time without sending machine gun shots to those on the other end. An upgrade on this would perfect the machine in my opinion.", "Date": "September 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "could be cheaper", "Author": "derrick", "ReviewID": "RNR2MZ2MIKZGU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great laptop but I bought mine from best buy for $200 less than amazons price.

I have had hardly any problems with it. I've gotten to really like Windows 8. It's a zippy little computer that can handle everything I throw at it. The battery last a while, about 4-5 hours no problem. The only problems I've had is sometimes the lighted keyboard turns off for no reason even though I have it set to always be on. I talked with a Samsung help rep about it and she said it was something that I couldn't change, which is irritating. And another thing the screen does get difficult to see at certain points. But yeah, it's great.Specs;3rd Gen I7-3635QM Professor, 6mb Cache, 2.4GHz speed with 3.2GHz Turbo Boost.-This computer is pretty fast.8GB DDR3 Memory.-Non upgradeable. You'd have to replace the motherboard to get more. But daily users, and even gamers there shouldn't be an issue.15.6\" LED HiDef display, 1600x900 resolution.-The screen can be hard to see, but colors are snappy, blacks are black, it's decent.Intel WiDi-After updating drives and what not I've had no issues with my wifi, full bars throughout my home.1 TB ATA II Hard drive, 5400 rpm.-For example I downloaded WoW, it took about 1 1/2 hours with 3.46mb/s the top speed. So pretty good.NVidia GeForce gt 640M graphics-WoW, Dead Space, Portal 1/2 both run beautifuly, no issues after adjusting some things.There is also Intel Graphics 4000. The computer is set to default to this, I set it to run the NVidia card instead, focusing on performance rather than appearance.5.3lbs-Light, made of aluminum. Feels excellent compared to other plastic computers.Back-lit island keyboard- Soft, quiet keys. Very nice. Has the number pad as well.I've had this computer for about a week. This is a Best Buy exclusive item, which means that it was made specifically to sell at Best Buy. It comes with Windows 8 64 bit, along with everything else I've listed above. First off, the very first day I was afraid I was going to have to return this computer. It was sluggish, the wifi kept dropping off, not coming back unless I hard restarted. Just disappointing. So the next day(After I became so frustrated I just couldn't mess with it anymore) I realized in the Windows 8 start up area there was a \"Charm\" that said \"SW Update\". 2 hours later, and having to find the updated NVidia drivers off of their website, this computer was completely different. Super zippy, opens everything like a champ. Ran WoW no problems, no lag, even with the downloader running in the background. So good for gaming, just about anything you could want it for.Windows 8 is a little hard to get used to, it takes some time. I was completely against it, but since Windows 7 is $100 by itself I figured I'd wait a week before getting it. I'm glad I did. Now that I've had some time to adjust, I like it. It's interesting, and fun. The only thing that really bothers me is the fact that certain apps that should be free (I.E. Facebook) are almost $3. Ridiculous.For the price and the stuff that is included I would highly recommend this laptop. It's light, quiet, well built, sleek, and just fancy looking. It IS hard to get set up and if I didn't have a husband with an IT degree I might have taken it back. But if you're semi tech-savy and want an awesome compute that'll make others jealous, get this bad boy. My husband is talking about selling his year old Asus ROG and picking up one of these.", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00A8ONW26"}}
