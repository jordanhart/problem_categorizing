So why Can't I have ...", "ReviewID": "R1XV5FO03YQOM9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "WE (My wife and I) tried the I5 version of this Ultrabook, model CT15-A1, and they are virtually the same.. same GOOD things and SAME NEgative things wrong with it.But when it comes to laptops and Notebooks, my Wife and I have different requirements in Laptops - You may be the same, SO READ ON.I spent almost $2000 on my laptop, last year... the ASUS G74SX.... It has the same display (1980x1020) paired with a Nvidia Graphics card GTX-560.... and you can't help but love these Screens - and I use my computers for VIDEO work. My wife loves my laptop for the Screen resolution 1920x1080 (1080p).... but she hates it for how heavy it is and how short the battery life is..She uses her computer for computer programming and shopping on the WEB....  AMAZON, ZAPPO's (Shoes), KNITTING RAVELRY, etc.  - So for her, NO real CPU horsepower required... just GREAT graphics and long BATTERY Life, and above all... PORTABILITY with Light Weight.Mine (Asus G74SX) weights almost 8 lbs.. so it's no Easy to carry laptop.... but this little VISIO (CT15-A1 or A2)... is SO light - you could literally lift it with one finger and fling it across the room  just as easily... despite the fact that it's case is built entirely out of Aluminum (So is mine, but I digress)Unfortunately, they also used the SAME mousepad/touchpad that I have in my laptop in these little VIZIO's. It's made by Sentilec and it's a real nightmare to use. Supposedly, when it works - it understands GESTURES, like an ipad or iphone... but most of the time, it won't even recognize your finger movements.. or worse, it grossly ignores or GREATLY exaggerates what finger movements you made. The result is that it stops tracking your fingers, unexpectedly... or it sends your mouse cursor over to the other side of the screen.... or sometimes it just acts as if your mouse is having epilyptic fits. I've never seen a mouse cursor \"dance\" around itself, like I have with this mousepad. Expect to use a wireless mouse if you buy this model or any VIZIO CT15 model (they all use the same Keyboard and Trackpad)....  or replace the mousepad with a Synaptic model down the road... but NEVER, Ever leave your mouse at home or you'll want to fling this laptop into the nearest wall if you have to use the Trackpad (mousepad), even for a minute or 4 hours (the life of this laptop on Batteries).And it's a shame, really... it's a great little laptop and I've seen it at a local Sams Club for $899 (I5 version)... and similar priced as Amazon, for the I7 (CT15-A2).  But wife liked it for having the same display resolution as mine (1980x1020) and it is a BEAUTIFUL Display.... and a great little Ultrabook if you can get yourself around the Keyboard (flat keys, no physical response when typing) and BUY yourself a Wireless MOUSE.And they're SO small and light, your kid can practically hide it inside a 3 Ring LooseLeaf Binder :)... so it fits into any 15\" Laptop case... with room to spare. SO THIN, and SO LIGHT you'll forget you even have it in with all those books. If your wife wanted one, she could practically slip it into her purse (if she carries a purse big enough to hold a Text book). A number of women friends we showed it to, liked the look of the laptops' metal case - It's that attractive.Battery Life - If you do a lot of web surfing, you'll love this display as far as battery life is concerned. It lasts around 4 hours. Your mileage will vary, but even PC MAG's review of this laptop got only 4.5 hours. VIZIO claims 6.5 hours... of course, MY laptop manufacturer claims I should get 4 hours from my Asus G74SX, but I rarely get more than 2 hours... but that is a Quad core I-7, with a 17.3\" Diagonal screen running at full 1080p resolution - but mine is a different Beast altogether!Nobody likes getting cheated on hours while far away from an AC outlet ... but anyone who's wanted a tablet for portability but wanted a laptop for real Work... you'll want to consider buying one these CT15 models from VIZIO (choose I5 if you do mostly web browsing, like my wife.. or I7 if you do any REAL work while away from home :) They combine a Great Display and Light weight, in a small package... without sacrificing hours of \"playing\" or Shopping time :)", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price.", "Author": "Michael F. Rogers \"HIPhopAR\"", "ReviewID": "R7YS3KSR1LTFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The hardware specs of this laptop is unmatched for its price. Granted, I bought a refurbished one yet it looks and runs as if brand new. In original packaging with plastic protector. Yea there are little annoyances. I owned the 14 inch version of this laptop and had the same problems. Mainly the track-pad. The keyboard issue that others describe as the keys not registering when pressed i haven't had with either models so far. Or if i had, they've been so minimal that I didn't notice.Ultimately, the track-pad isn't so terrible that it's unbearable. The rest of the laptop definitely compensates for the poor track-pad.This laptop is BEAUTIFUL as well. The crystal clear screen is amazing and the aluminum uni-body design is flawless.Keyboard doesn't light up but that sounds like a first world problem to me but hey, to each his own I suppose.The highlight of my purchase though was the extremely fast shipping.

Applied every driver update Vizio's support staff asked me to, following the precise order of the steps they wanted. Never fixed the problem. Sent it back for repair, it came back and locked up within the hour. Once it locks up, even rebooting doesn't help, and it stays locked even when booting another OS (Linux) on the same machine, so it isn't clear to me how this is a driver problem to begin with. Eventually they sent me a refurbished machine to replace the one I had. It locks up too, on a different schedule. Most lock-ups seem to last for some time (sometimes a few minutes, sometimes more) and then it moves again, so maybe these can be described as freezes. Regardless, the touchpad is a complete waste of time. The feel of the touchpad  is vague, compared to a Thinkpad touchpad, and of course, the Thinkpad never locks up. I also use a Samsung Series 9 touchpad sometimes, it is vague compared to the Thinkpad, but better then the Vizio, and it never locks up. In short, the Sentelic touchpad in the Vizio CT15 is complete junk. This ruins the entire ball of wax, making the machine unusable without an external pointing device.Two stars because of the gorgeous case design and screen, fast hard drive and processor.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "good start but a bit lacking", "Author": "mgg", "ReviewID": "R2ZDI2LDTLUPQJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "as mentioned by numerous posts, the touchpad is basically un-usable before the driver update. Even after the update, still a bit jumpy compared to my other computers. Hopefully they come up with more updates. Good thing is I usually use a usb mouse anyway. The look, feel, speed of the computer is quite nice for the price, and if they can fix all the minor details, it'd be a great product.

I've owned a few laptops and they all have keyboard quirks. On this one, the enter and right shift keys seem to be a bit of a stretch and I'm not sure why. Probably after typing on it for a few hours one can get used to it. It would be nice if the keys were backlit. I have backlit keys on my desktop keyboard and it's one of those things that is easy to get used to and forget that it is there.On the plus side, the laptop boots up ridiculously fast. The entire Windows logo doesn't even have time to appear. The 256GB SSD is basically unheard of at this price range. The same can be said for the full HD screen (1920x1080.)I wanted to say that I have not had any issues with the touchpad. I don't know if I got lucky or if the issue has been resolved. I also don't understand the complaints about having no physical buttons. I've never used a touchpad like that, but I've had no issues with learning how to use it.I haven't tested the battery very much yet so I can't comment on that.Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase. The only reason I've given it 4/5 is I haven't really used it enough to honestly say \"I love it.\"", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great ultrabook with a few hangups", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R3F6XB4W0T45KT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this machine because it seemed comparable to a Macbook Air at a very competitive price. As far as Window's laptops go, it's a good one.Pros: Very light and thin but with sturdy build quality. Vivid screen, responsive keyboard, almost no bloatware packaged with the OS.Cons: Speakers sometimes break up a little when pushed to the limit, but not a huge deal for me. Keyboard isn't backlit, also not a huge deal, but bothers some peopleBiggest warning: The trackpad is subpar. It's usable, but finicky every so often. It hates sweaty fingers or any moisture, and the gestures (like scrolling and zooming) can be inconsistent at times. Also a must: UPDATE THE DRIVER when you buy this laptop. Without the update, the trackpad is unbearably buggy. The update brings most issues to a minimum.Overall grade: A-I recommend for anyone who wants a nice ultrabook and isn't too picky about the few hangups I listed.", "Date": "November 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY THIS COMPUTER", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R1Q4XH540364IX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Poorly constructed keyboard and touchpad.Then, on top of that, from the beginning it froze 3-4 times a week. Now, 9 months later (I bought the computer in Oct. 2012, it is now Aug. 2013) the fan has broken and there are motherboard issues.Turns out the reseller was not authorized and had not even bought the machine from Vizio, but had bought it from Microsoft. This has voided the warranty. In fact, there isn't even a serial # anywhere on the machine, so somebody clearly removed it. Have no idea if the serial # that was on the box even matches the machine I bought.Vizio refuses to help and ManjaTech, the reseller, refuses to help. So now I'm out over $1000 because the IT tech who I use for minor issues has told me it's not worth trying to fix - that I can buy a new computer for less (and he doesn't sell computers so he's not getting anything out of telling me to buy a new machine).I am utterly infuriated.
