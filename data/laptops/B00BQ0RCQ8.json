I am glad that I didn't pay the price listed. Overall the computer is great, but there are a few things that bother me. It's a Windows 8 computer, and sometimes when I drag my finger across the touch pad, it sends me back to the previous app that I had open off of the main screen. I can easily get back to what I was doing but it shouldn't happen to begin with. Physically, the black surrounding the screen pops when I move it (like when I am adjusting the screen forward and backwards, I don't just randomly squeeze my computer).The computer is very fast and it's taken a little bit to get used to since I am going from a Windows 7 to a Windows 8. I haven't figured out how to put Microsoft on the desktop (or any icon on to the desktop) but I am sure I will figure that out sooner or later. The sound on this is great (especially compared to my old Acer computer) and I find myself only having it halfway and it's still a little loud for my taste! I didn't have any trouble setting up wireless or Microsoft Defender (the Windows 8 version of Microsoft Essentials) but Norton did get in the way from setting it up at first. There are a lot of available apps that you can put on the front screen, a lot of them being free!!I found it strange that all of the function keys are opposite from what I am used to; for example: before I would press F5 and the page would refresh, but now I have to press FN F5 for it to refresh and the other function (the backlit keyboard on and off) is the first function. I hope that makes sense!The keyboard is easy to type on, and the letters aren't having any problem with sticking. They are soft in a way and it's very comfortable.I set up my computer so that when I unlock it, I have to swipe my finger on the scanner and I haven't had any problems with that either. It's kind of fun having such a personal computer!I would suggest this product for someone else.", "Date": "November 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Got it. Love it.", "Author": "G. K. Youngblood", "ReviewID": "R3JRL6ZM51TM3I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Cons:I have owned many HP laptops in my day. It just ends up happening. I do not like that they put in a bunch of HP software that I never use and perpetually gets in my way. Also, the first unit I purchased had some weird glitch where every 65 second the DVD drive would pop open. However, now that I have a working one I like it so much I felt the need to review it. Also, this computer is trying really hard to be an Apple product. It's silver shell and black back lit keyboard echo that of a Macbook. However, it is light and feels like a cheaper version of the apple product. Finally, there is a movement to change the design of the arrow keys so that left and right buttons are full sized but up and down buttons are half sized. I use these buttons all the time and the half sized buttons are annoying.So enough of the negatives. What are the things that make this a four star product?1. It is a cheaper product. It costs over 50% less than an apple product. I love the price. And I think for what is paid the laptop offers a lot.2. Backlit keyboard. It is a perk I have been waiting for. they seems to usually be reserved for ultrabooks. It is nice to see the price point drop on this feature.3. I am not much of a computer \"guts\" kind of guy. I just want the computer to do what I want it to. I do not need to know all the inside stuff. I do know that the audio quality is good and I am able to run my PC games well on it without issue. I have heard reviews saying the screen is cheap but I have no complaints. It is higher quality than the laptop it replaced and for that i am grateful. I do not think the average user will feel cheated when it comes to the display quality.Overall, I just like it. It works well and I feel comfortable using it.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "excelent", "Author": "Fernando", "ReviewID": "R3FEDC9XASBWR1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this is a very good laptop a very light, amazing design and good quality, always bought HP because i think it's a good product", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "A solid performer - 4.5 stars", "Author": "J. Chambers", "ReviewID": "R3OU0F874H6IIQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop on sale at Best Buy about six months ago. My old desktop PC was dying, and I decided to go with a single computer for both home use and travel. The HP Envy M6 had the specs I wanted, and even though I didn't want Windows 8, I'm learning to use it. So far, it's been a great computer, except for one serious problem - the screen failed after only a few weeks. Since the laptop was still under warranty, I took it to Best Buy, and they returned it to HP. The repairs were made, and the laptop was returned to me eight days later, which is pretty good service.I like most of the features of the laptop, but the one that stands out most is the backlit keyboard. My eyesight isn't the best, but the backlighting makes the keys very visible, so much so that I don't know how I ever got along without this feature. The USB 3.0 ports are great, and I've replaced some of my older USB 2.0 devices to take advantage of the greater speed of USB 3.0. My wife has an older HP laptop that lacks the backlit keys and USB 3.0, so I know how handy both of those features are.I'm running MS Office 2007, Google Chrome, and other miscellaneous software with no problems. The laptop boots very quickly, and I have to thank HP for not loading it up with crapware like some manufacturers do. The Beats Audio has good sound for a laptop, but I usually use earbuds when I'm listening to music. Weighing just over five pounds, the laptop isn't much of a burden for traveling, and the case seems sturdy enough.Overall, I'm very pleased with the HP Envy M6 laptop. It has the computing power and speed of many desktops, and I'm enjoying using it as my primary computer.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Choice", "Author": "Hanjad", "ReviewID": "R1SKJH1TOB7Y38", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you need lots of Memory and a large hard drive together with a fast processor buy this.

The chiclet keyboard takes a bit of getting used to, but the touchpad has just the right responsiveness.  The backlit keyboard is a nice touch.  The numeric keyboard at the side is an absolute necessity for multinational characters.  Seems like many of the manufacturer are abandoning side and overlay keyboards.The fingerprint reader is superb for quickly unlocking the laptop.  I virtually always lock my account when stepping away; the fingerprint reader speeds up my return.The material is significantly cheaper.  In particular, the silver finish on the cover is an ultrathin veneer that rubs off from casual contact with a dresser drawer.  Also, the keyboard frame was not fully locked in on one of the laptops when first opened; I had to click it into place.  But these are cosmetic features for me.  The operational features are strong enough to warrant five stars.I also looked at Apple first.  They want $1500-1600 for a comparable machine.  I paid $700 for the HP at BestBuy.

Laptop is fast and don't have problems with loading things or what not. Plenty of ram and memory. Total overkill really i mean 8gb of ram?

It can be quite useful, use it for logging into any website and logging into your computer. Fan stopped working also... but just for a short time like a few days, not sure why but thought i was going to have to return it. The camera is mediocre. Also has bad intigrated graphics. But that is normal for intel  In hindsight I should have gotten the amd version of this computer, amd has better graphic support and it was actually 100 bucks cheaper.

Estep", "ReviewID": "R2TQDQWL105XOQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Bought my first HP Envy with Windows 7 in November 2012, which lasted a month before bogging down when I was typing an email.  It kept getting hung up on the letters I was typing until finally locking up completely.  After hard restarting, could not get past the initial load screen.Took it back to where I bought it and exchanged for the same model with Windows 8.  Got it home and started it up, and was immediately greeted by a frozen pixel in the middle of the screen.Exchanged it the next day, then used the latest laptop only a couple times a week for the next 8-9 months before coming home one day and starting it up to find the screen was completely grey, turning to blue vertical lines once the start-up sequence was finished.  HP was quick to respond, but said I wasn't covered by warranty for hardware.  When I asked to be put through to someone with whom I could discuss options for getting the issue fixed, I was put on hold for ten minutes before I finally gave up on getting any real help.While it was working, I enjoyed most of the features such as the beats audio, the back-lit keyboard, and the finger scanner until it stopped working about a month before the screen did.  I did not care for the finger swiping on the mouse pad to change between active programs in Windows 8 (usually by accident) or the overall flimsiness of the computer (undoubtedly leading to the malfunctioning screen).", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better all the time", "Author": "jcwartick", "ReviewID": "R26WX5FWSRES76", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is fast, beautiful and works fine for me.

I got a heck of a deal, getting it brand new for under $400. It arrived in a distressed box, which I was aware of at the time of the purchase. I did purchase a 1TB SSD drive and 16GB of ram from Amazon for it. Would I buy this lapop again? Absolutely! This thing screams now and it was pretty fast prior to the upgrades. I have a HP Envy I bought last year, which I like, but when my son came home from college with a different HP and I saw his back lighted keyboard, I knew my other laptop was going to be replaced. I love the back lighted keyboard. The screen is nice and sharp. the DVD drive is quiet and fast. I haven't checked the battery to see how long it lasts under normal usage, especially with the updated SSD drive, but I do know that the battery lasted through 2 Nexflix movies with about 45% of the charge remaining, with the screen on full brightness. With the SSD drive, the fan stays quiet and the bottom on the laptop gets a little warm on the left side, but never hot or uncomfortable when on my lap. I like that the battery is user-replaceable, unlike my other Envy. I just discovered that mine doesn't have a bluetooth radio, so I am buying a bluetooth 4.0 usb adapter and I'll be set for a few years. I do some light to moderate gaming, movie watching, music playing, and movie burning, and this laptop handles it all very well.

The wireless reception is very weak. It is useful only in the strongest signal area. Even at Starbucks, I have to chose my table carefully, as it only works at some. It gets one bar and a lot of drops in a location where an older HP and a really old Lenovo had no trouble, and got several bars more. The 7 yr old Lenovo still gets 4 and 5 bars in the same spot. I would not recommend buying this unless you have very easy return privileges.2. It lacks a card slot, requiring an adapter for photo viewing. This is a serious inconvenience.3. The 4 USB ports are jammed together so that almost everything except the narrowest a USB device or connector interferes with the adjacent port. Things like aircards, antennas, card readers, connectors for an external mouse, etc. I have even had to use a knife to cut some rubber off of the side of some USB cord plugs. One USB port is so close to the power receptacle that some things interfere with the power cable plug. I had to use a knife to cut some rubber off the power plug to ease interference with USB devices. And, with this laptop's deficiencies, three of the four USB ports are taken up by necessary devices just to use the laptop. 1. The weak LAN reception requires a USB antenna to get a decent wi fi signal. 2. The poor touchpad requires an external mouse. 3. The lack of a card slot requires an external card reader. ...after the deficiencies of the laptop are taken care of by external devices, this leaves only one USB port left to use for thumb drives, printers, etc. As a result, one is always  juggling and balancing USB devices.4. The USB ports are loose and wiggly. They do not inspire confidence of a long life. My ancient Lenovo far surpasses this computer.5. The power cord receptacle on the right side is really inconvenient. Not only is it too close to one USB port, but it clutters up the area where many right-handers place a mouse or a beverage. A 90 degree cord end and a receptacle on the back would be much more versatile. Or maybe two receptacles  for those into cord management.6. The cord from the wall receptacle to the brick is incredibly bulky and stiff, having 3 heavy conductors. It is as heavy as a large microwave cord. Very inconvenient when stuffing it into my laptop bag or a briefcase. I see no reason for a ground, since the brick has no exposed metal parts.7. The lighted keyboard is neat, but only good for those who sit fairly close to the computer and are tall or sit high. A person who sits a little back or low gets the glare of the LEDs of the top rows of keys to mess up his night vision.8. The screen is very glossy, making reflections a problem.9. Easily damaged soft aluminum lid. I liked my 1 1/2 yr old HP's cross-hatched plastic body better than this one's aluminum lid. It will pick up scratches and marks and will look pristine only for a little while. the previous one's cross-hatched plastic seemed to hide everything.10. The keyboard is extraordinarily flimsy, with even the lightest touch making the area around each struck key flex downward. This does not inspire confidence.It's virtues are:1. Really good battery life and an accurate indicator of time left.2. The battery is user-replaceable, instead of being hijacked by sending it back to the center for a replacement. Also good for carrying a spare, or taking it out when plugged in to the wall.3. Light and thin. It means little to me, but it is important to some.4. The keyboard does not have a shrunken shift key like some recent laptops, although the delete key is really small. I would also be very happy to see the number pad on the right removed from small laptops.All in all, I think HP needs to be more careful which Chinese outsourced product they stick their decal on. The HP name means very little any more.5. The sound is a little better than most others.6. It still has an optical disk drive, making loading drivers and programs very convenient.7. The touch pad is a little better than the 1 1/2 yr old HP it replaced.8.
