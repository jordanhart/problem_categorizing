Performs well. He's already used up all of his hard drive space gaming, but that's what deleting old games fixes - fault of child, not of laptop. The keyboard has slightly raised contoured keys which look and feel more like a traditional keyboard which I love. The price was reasonable and has worked well for his school work too.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "AMD A6-4400M 2.7GHz Accelerated Processor, AMD Radeon HD 7520G Discrete-Class graphics and up to 2036MB total graphics memory, Genuine Windows 8\n15.6-inch diagonal HD BrightView LED-backlit display (1366x768, Altec Lansing dual speakers with Dolby Advanced Audio\n4GB DDR3 SDRAM (1 DIMM), Multi-Format Digital Media Card Reader for Secure Digital cards & Multimedia cards\n320GB 5400RPM hard drive, SuperMulti DVD burner\nHP TrueVision HD Webcam with integrated dual array digital microphone, HDMI, 2 SuperSpeed USB 3.0", "Name": "HP Pavilion g6-2228nr 15.6 inch Laptop AMD A6 4400M 2.7GHz Processor, 4GB Ram, 320GB Hard Drive, Windows 8", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41KG9d0K0QL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00A9TCO60"}}
