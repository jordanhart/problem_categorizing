I have had my laptop for over 6 months now and the only problem I have experienced is it locking up every now and then.  I restart and have no problems afterward.  This happens maybe once per month.  I have heard Windows Vista could be the cause of this, but I am not sure.I also have a problem finding some of my documents simply because I'm not familiar with Vista, but this is nothing that can't be fixed with a little education.I love the number pad on the side, I've always been bothered when I have to use the numbers above the letters.  I like the chocolate color, it is so much more attractive than black.  I have watched DVDs and they play great and look great on the screen.  The sound is good, but gets a little \"crackly\" when too loud.  The volume control located on the actual keyboard is a little sensitive, but I have gotten used to it and am okay with it now.  I don't find the speed of this machine to be a problem, but I also use an external hard drive for all of my music and photo files, so I'm not using too much memory space.The only major gripe I have, and it's trivial, is that it has been difficult finding a cute bag that fits the 17\" size.  All bags that are big enough are usually all black and look too professional or boring.  I wanted something a little more colorful and am still searching.  But I wouldn't trade the size of my laptop for a cute bag, I can't live without my number keypad on the side.  :)", "Date": "November 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "No major complaints here", "Author": "A. Brown", "ReviewID": "R2OCFVET7CTVUJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop refurbished back in April 2009.  After about 4 months the hard drive crashed but not big deal I picked up a new one that was faster for $65.  It came with Windows Vista and it's speed was ok for the first month but after that it literally took 10 minutes to boot up before I could do anything in Windows.  I have since installed Windows 7 and it works GREAT!  It boots up in about 1 minute now and I have the same software installed as I had with Windows Vista (if not more).  I love the HDMI port so I can hook it up to my 42\" LCD tv and surf the internet from the couch (as I'm doing right now).  I wouldn't pay $1,000 for this laptop (I paid $550 for it refurbished) but I would recommend this laptop to anyone, no problems here!", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "BOTH of my Pavilion DV-7's were disappointing", "Author": "Shawn Bishop \"Shawn R Bishop\"", "ReviewID": "R32X5SFE83KNJ2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My first DV-7 had a hard drive that went bad within a week.

Upgrading to Windows 7 would definitely help. But that is just because Vista happens to fail at all aspects of life.The battery life is pretty impressive considering the size and power of the laptop, but you will go through a battery every year or so, but that is not a horrible replacement cost, meh 35 dollars or so.The power cords are a bit touchy, oh well, buy one online if you end up needing one for 8 dollars, again, not a big issue.For the overheating issue people are talking about, it does get hot. It happens, it is a 17in laptop. It's kinda what you should expect going into it. You cannot compare this laptop to a netbook or a 15in laptop and complain about heating, different issue all together. So I recommend if you are having that issue, buy an external laptop fan for the computer. They can be cheap and quite comfortable. Bought one about a year ago and my laptop has not had an issue since. This will also help prevent issues with the hard drive overheating. Another problem solved.Also, making sure to use compressed air to clean out the fans help on large laptops.All in all, it is a good laptop for the price. It is easily upgradeable in RAM and Hard Drive. The processor is ok, but for general use fills the need. Just like any purchase, you need to make sure to put the accessories around it to optimize its performance, and for this laptop the costs are not that much.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lovely aesthetics, awesome entertainment software, horrible infrastructure.", "Author": "E.Boakye", "ReviewID": "R329OEDWB851DX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I HAD had this computer for about 2 years, and about 3 or 4 days ago, it died. Out of the package it ran fine, but about 6 or 7 month into owning it, the power cord had to be replaced due to the faulty power input design. This continued (I replaced the power cord 4 times total). In the meantime, the hard drive failed, so I replaced that one, only to find that the computer would run so hot, it would shut itself down about ever 45 minutes on the regular for thermal protection. Then it would stay on any longer than 20 minutes after that. I figure it's electrical problems and/or the motherboard. Regardless, there shouldn't be any reason for this to happen to so many of the same model (my roommate had the exact model I had, and her motherboard fried after 7 months or so). Probably won't be buying another HP again.

I should bought a Dell or Mac. This laptop had problems in the first 6 months, I called the helpline which took the tech 2hrs to solve my problem&even; then I had to restore it to the original factory settings! I had to do the factory restore  again after the warranty ended due errors that kept coming up after I did a driver update from the HP update site, it was their update that caused the error! I called HP & was told I would have to pay $49.00 for a tech the help me over the phone ! I have had to go thru the  chat line serveral times to correct other errors&justlast; week the screen went black& the computer won't start no matter  what I do. HP will not help you. I called to complain & spoke to two case managers,the first one put me on hold while she finished up a previous file& then said she couldn't help me & then second case manager called me while he was eating,kept chewing in my ear & said HP will  not do anything since my warranty was over& this model is not the one that is reported to have corrupt motherboard. He said it was my responsibility to have purchased the extended warranty offerd by HP (once the manufacturer's warranty ended)& that HP will not do anything for me! Before you consider buying this laptop  go to the HP Support Forum& type in the search field :lock up freezes& hangs : you will see alot of users who have this problem with different versions of the Pavilion laptop.", "Date": "April 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "One of the worst computers I have ever bought", "Author": "K.

No biggie, as I had my data backed up and it was under warranty. I figured, it was bound to happen to someone. Well, just today, the REPLACEMENT hard drive has ALSO FAILED.I was under the impression HP made good quality notebooks. Unfortunately, after my purchase of this particular model, that perception has changed. This notebook runs exceptionally hot, even for low-memory-usage applications. It frequently shuts itself off for thermal protection, which means if you don't have a way to cool this laptop down, you better save your data and OFTEN.This model also purports to have an ATI Radeon 3200 HD Mobility Graphics Card. If it does, it doesn't like to show itself. The graphics are gritty, slow to respond and overall do not function anywhere near as smoothly as purported to.I would stay away from this laptop. There are other models available from other manufacturrs that will run double the memory usage and not run anywhere near as hot as this, nor will the hard drives fail every 3 months.", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Slooooooooow...", "Author": "Manny Hernandez \"@askmanny\"", "ReviewID": "R9MUAFOJZEKN8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We got this 17-inch laptop because of its price, thinking we were getting a great deal.
