Thin, lightweight, and full-powered. Build quality is acceptable-- better than your standard consumer-grade machine, although not up to the standards of a Thinkpad (a true Thinkpad, not one the watered-down value lines Lenovo has recently introduced), an E6XXX Latitude, or Elitebook. On the other hand, it is (again) thinner and lighter than most business machines, and packs a surprising amount of processing power considering its form factor.Pros:1. Thin and light-- ideal for travel, especially with the small AC adapter.2. Good battery life. 5 hours is easily achieved with the stock battery with brightness at about 70%, wifi on, and browsing/office app work. This is actually excellent when one takes into account the CPU and physical size of the machine.3. Docking connector. If you use docks, you'll understand why this is so important. If not, try a dock (a true dock-- not a USB aftermarket model) and you will never purchase another work machine that does not have a native docking connection. The Toshiba dock is not cheap, but is full-featured and integrates perfectly, with no hot-plugging issues.4. Horsepower. Powerful CPU, good enough on the graphics front for business and dual monitors, plenty of RAM support, and the stock HDD is good (throw in an SSD to make the machine really fly).5. Matte screen. It's not glossy. Enough said. Brightness is good enough for indoors work, but not quite there in the sun.6. Trackpad off button. Very handy for typing, to prevent random cursor movement and clicks.7. Fingerprint reader that actually works well.Cons:1. Heat and noise. There is no way around this, really. Cram a high-power CPU and an optical drive into a thin machine, and this is the price. Fan revs up really quickly, even under light load, and the constant ramping up and slowing down can be annoying. The machine also gets toasty under load, enough to be a bit uncomfortable.2. No touchpoint/trackpoint. If I used this machine as an actual laptop most of the time, as opposed to keeping it docked, this would be a deal-breaker. But, if you are not a trackpoint fan, this should not bother you at all.3. Gaudy chrome accents on the trackpad buttons and hinges. Yes, this is nitpicky, but if accents must be used, at least make them real metal.Other:1. As mentioned, build quality is OK. Don't expect this machine to survive abuse like a full-fledged business machine.2. Built-in camera and mic work perfectly well for videoconferencing, although the native speakers do not get terribly loud.3. The screen is a typical TN panel, but not horrible. It is usable with decent viewing angles (for a TN) and a serviceable resolution.4. Not sure how cluttered the machine is on the factory image; I have read reports that it is quite cluttered, so users should be aware that a clean install may be called for.5. Screen hinge seems quite tight. Again, not Thinkpad heavy-duty, but the screen is very thin and light, so I don't anticipate they will be problematic.6. Keyboard is island-style and OK. It's a bit difficult to describe-- if you press the keys individually, they seem quite stiff and unimpressive. However, in actual use, it is actually quite decent. I would not hate my life if I had to use this keyboard extensively.7. There is an optical drive. Big plus if you need one, but these days, it's not quite a deal maker or breaker.Conclusion: No big surprises here. Price is ultimately going to be the deciding factor, unless some of the other features (especially the weight and slim profile) are selling points. In the $1K range, there is pretty stiff competition from the Thinkpad X2XX and Elitebook 2XXX series. The newer version (R800 series) reportedly improves on what I perceive to be the biggest issue with this model-- heat (and subsequently noise). The latest version of the i5 (Sandy Bridge) uses a 32nm process for the GPU and almost certainly has some additional power optimizations.12/21/2011 updateHaving used this notebook for a few months, here are some additional observations:1. The CPU really needs an SSD to stretch its legs. A G2 80GB Intel makes a noticeable difference, and is well-worth the cost. Swapping the drive out is a simple matter, and Intel provides free migration software for easy cloning. This performance boost should not have come as a surprise, but the difference never fails to impress me. I expect slightly longer batter life as well, but have not tested yet.2. The speakers are seriously weak and lacking. An external speaker is a requirement if using this to share content/give presentations.3. The palm rest area is a bit too flexible. The mag-alloy is solid enough, but there does not appear to be a rigid underlayer. Picking the system up by the left side causes the fan to compress a bit and results in a slightly disturbing grinding noise.4. Battery life is quite good, but a spare is highly recommended if you use this for CPU-intensive work. Nonetheless, a full charge will only drain ~45-55% in the course of 2 hours of a media-rich presentation streaming over WebEx.5. Noise/heat remain weak points. The fan has a very steep ramp-up curve, and this can get quite annoying during meetings. I'd wager that the fan noise alone would be enough to give away the fact that you are watching videos/playing games instead of paying attention. Even at idle, the fan is noisy enough such that the system is never silent. With an SSD, my ThinkPads have been essentially noise-free at equal workloads; the Toshiba is quiet most of the time for emails, light Office app work, etc, but you know it's there.6. Fingerprint reader works quite well. Much less picky than previous generations, and is actually useful enough to be a viable alternative to inputting passwords with the KB.7. Keyboard becomes squeaky and annoying over time, even with light use. I amend my previous comment about it-- I actually would hate my life if I had to use it exclusively.Conclusion: Not sure why anyone would be considering this particular model for personal use, but if your company purchased one for you, do whatever it takes to convince your IT department to upgrade you to a good SSD.", "Date": "July 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Portege R700", "Author": "jsgdave", "ReviewID": "R10ZJXF7VQNQUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with this machine.

Both have been unreliable, both had to be returned for service within the first two months, and my dealings with the Toshiba service depot ranged from very disappointing to downright nightmarish.The Portege had a very noisy fan right out of the box, plus within a few weeks the plastic casing around the headphone jack came out making the jack unusable.  Upon return from the service department, the fan was only a little less noisy and the jack had not been fixed.  I didn't return the computer a second time only because my daughter didn't want to lose the use of it for another several weeks.  This experience was highly disappointing, but the nightmare is yet to come.The Satellite developed some nasty lines in the display after a month or so, so it too goes off to the service depot.  Then I get a phone call telling me the repair isn't covered under warranty because they considered it to be caused by abuse, and they wanted $300 to fix it.  I don't believe the computer was ever abused, but if I wanted it fixed they had me over a barrel, so I gave them my credit card number and authorized a repair.A week later the computer shows up, and far from being repaired, it is twice as bad as it was before, with even more lines!  I call again, they tell me to ship it back to them again, I do so, blah blah blah.  Couple weeks later it returns.... NOT FIXED.  This time they actually didn't fix it on purpose.  I received a letter with it saying they couldn't reach me to authorize the repair.  Not bloody likely - I had received no phone calls or emails or messages from them. And why does it need authorization?  I already paid for it!So I call again, and now, get this:  THEY HAVE NO RECORD THAT I EVER PAID FOR IT.  I can see the charge on my credit card statement, but these morons don't know it was paid for.  I can't even ask for my money back because they don't even realize I paid them! I give up in disgust, call my credit card company to dispute the charge, and I take the computer to my local, very honest and very competent repair shop, which does a fine job fixing it for less money.Take it from someone who made the mistake of buying Toshiba not once, but twice.  JUST SAY NO!  I have sworn never to buy any Toshiba product again, not a computer, not a television, not a radio, not nothing.  Once burned, twice shy.  Wait a minute - make that twice burned.
