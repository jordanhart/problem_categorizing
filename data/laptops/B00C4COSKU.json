{"Reviews": [{"Title": "works well but the display and body are too fragile", "Author": "a dad", "ReviewID": "R15IODH4YPFXDB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a 14-b120dx.  Mine is less than a year old and I've already replaced the screen twice because it's so easy to flex it or even hit it from behind. The display is a little over 3/8 inch thick and you have to be really careful how you handle it or transport it. A padded case isn't enough, you'll need a hard shell case. Also I see a crack on the main body just under the edge of the display. I don't remember it getting hit hard there either. It's not the kind of thing you would buy your kid to take to school.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$449.99", "Features": "14\" LED-backlit high-definition display  With BrightView technology and 1366 x 768 resolution showcases movies and games in stunning clarity.\n2nd Gen Intel\u00ae CoreTM i3-2375M processor  Features a 1.5GHz processor speed.\n4GB DDR3 SDRAM  For multitasking power, expandable to 8GB.\n500GB hard drive (5400 rpm)  Offers spacious storage and fast read/write times.
