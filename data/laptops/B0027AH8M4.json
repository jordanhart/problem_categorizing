I am actually typing my review on THIS exact computer right now.After upgrading this system to Windows 8.1 I decided to publish a review.  This computer has been on Vista, 7 and now 8.1 and performs fast and still has a windows experience index better than some newer computers out there.The only replacement part this computer has had has been the battery (6 months ago).  The computer can run Dead Space (game) pretty decently.It was worth every penny I spent on it.  And it is still working now.  No missing key, all buttons function, screen works, you name it!

I even got upgraded from Vista to Windows 7 for free from the Gateway/Microsoft deal that occured.  One of my favorite features is HDMI, that allows for plugging this into a LCD/Plasma for watching movies in hotel rooms and at home for some streaming movies.  The battery now has a little trouble making it through a full Dvd movie, but does well if the movie is on the Hard Drive -- the fact that it still lasts longer than an hour on battery power amazes me considering most four year old batteries wouldn't survive longer than a few minutes (besides, when I'm using it I'm usually near a power source these days).Best laptop I have ever owned.", "Date": "May 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "reliable great laptop 3 year review", "Author": "Chandana Bommireddy \"shoesy\"", "ReviewID": "R2QNPD18LWEMGM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for almost 3 years. I had updated the memory and nothing else has been done.I had lost the charger and got myself ebay replacement which destroyed the port by expanding. Gateway fixed the port for free and sent me a replacement charger.I did get lot of viruses which made the laptop overheat so linux or replacing the windows every two month will help you last this computer for very long time.only complaint is speakers and wifi card (not as good as other laptops but if you have excellent router this will not be a issue).", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A real college stuent's review", "Author": "A REAL college student", "ReviewID": "R3BO96FH9S9VJV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's an Okay laptop. A little slow running (thanks in partially to how much of a resource hog vista is). If you can get one with windows 7 I would. I personally received this laptop from my mother so it's little on the old side (maybe a year or two). I suppose it's not horrible for the price.The looks are nice except for the fact that the outside attracts finger smudges like there's no tomorrow.Does the job as far as running various programs. I personally am a Graphic Design/ Computer Animation student in college. This computer can run programs such as photoshop, indesign, and lightwave fairly decently without any freezing.The battery on this pretty much sucks.... It stopped charging to full charge within only a few months of use. however I think this may also have been an issue with vista itself not recognizing the charge? As since installing linux it seems to be charging right.Also my charge cord broke after not to long. But this may have just been how my mother was using it before she gave it to me.I recently have had a problem with it where the computers shell (vista) began to have issues....for some reason I didn't get the disc or anything with this to reinstall it. I had to install linux (ubuntu 10.04lts for the curious) on it. seems to have made the laptop run much faster so far. The built in camera is not automatically detected...still trying to see if its compatible with linux. Really not an issue unless you want linux...which most users won't. The fact that windows went wonky on my laptop is more a bad luck issue then anything else so It's not something to worry about to much when purchasing just make sure you have windows instillation cds or the company is willing to telly you how to reinstall windows when you buy it is all.The only true bad thing I can say about this laptop is that the keyboard is crappy. you really have to slam the keys down to get the laptop to recognize all the letters you type. Which is annoying as it will occasionally not even accept some letters and so yo'll have typos where you'll be missing only one letter in the word (and in the entire sentence as shown by my awesome you'll typo..... -_-;)What the kid said above is true...it's a little heavy though certainly not the heaviest computer.okay graphics card...not amazing. will play some games like call of duty and the sims...but nothing to graphic heavy.Soooo the breakdown.Cons:Crap keyboard (have to press really hard to get all your letters typed)Sloooooow internet (with vista...don't know about xp or 7)Possible bad battery (though not sure since it now charges fine under linux)Webcam not auto detected wit linux (not suprising...and probably not useful info to most people)possible delicate corddidn't get shell backupPros:fairly nice lookingworks for everyday usecan run programs that use a lot of ram and not crash (like photoshop, lightwave)runs well speed wise under linux (probably with windows7 to)Fairly good for the price (especially if you generally have better luck with computer then me and my family. lol)", "Date": "April 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Buy!", "Author": "Stephania Biddings \"PhDMom\"", "ReviewID": "R7NKFUBHYWF1H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My son needed a lap top for college.

When I got it I ripped open the package. Before I turned it on I just stared at it for like 15 minutes! It is so \"sexy\" as some reviews quoted. I agree. If you're just in it for the looks (which I am not), you want this computer. If you're looking for a fast computer for download large files and surf the web, this is ideal for you. This computer has 802.11 draft-n. Super fast computer even without a Wireless-N router. Plus it's good for frequent DVD/CD Burning with DVD+RDL plus it has Labelflash! Plus it's got an HDMI cable hole! It comes with a nice large touch pad. But if you like mice better, check out my review on the Targus AMU0503US Mini Kaleidoscope Optical Retractable Mouse. Read my pros, cons and suggestions.Pros: HDMI hole, DVD+R DL and CD-R drive, 802.11 draft-n wireless, \"sexy\" look if you will, Labelflash for Lazering pictures onto your DVD or CD, Wide screen, 3GB DDR2 Memory, Windows Vista Home Premium, and 250GB hard drive.Cons: A little heavy.Suggestions: I would suggest using this as an everyday every-function computer!", "Date": "November 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Just bought this yesterday - no major complaints", "Author": "Brandon A. Alford", "ReviewID": "R6SDK4DE4KASF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just purchased this laptop from Best Buy yesterday, and I'm pleased so far with the results. I was a little apprehensive about making the switch to Vista 64 bit, but so far, so good. I've only found one HW item so far that I've had trouble with -  a little $10 USB travel mouse. So far, all other software and hardware has worked fine in Vista 64 (most importantly, my old games).  I haven't run into any issues yet, just the typical bloatware that was installed on the PC by gateway. One other annoyance with the scroll function on the mousepad. The right area is dedicated to the scroll function, and it's not quite as responsive as I'd like, but so far, that's my only complaint about this laptop (one that I'll not have to deal with once I get a compatible USB mouse).  I have played both Titan Quest and Age of Empires 3, with the detail cranked all the way up, and while I had to dial back a couple of the settings, the laptop has performed admirably well. I haven't had a chance to load any FPS games yet, but feel that I'll be able to run those at medium settings.", "Date": "May 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY!!", "Author": "POS", "ReviewID": "R1EBAHK5C9BOTY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "From day one, Has been the slowest laptop I have ever owned...
