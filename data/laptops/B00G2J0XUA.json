The WiFi cards have always seemed LINUX ready and that's contrary to what's usually finicky WiFi but ready CAT5 ports.WiFi range is strong, hard to buy a Toshi w/o an 802.11n card and big cigar width four inch copper antennas metal taped to the inner lid means decent signal strength when the rest of the audience is struggling to hold 240p on YouTube.Toshi's are fairly sturdy but the easiest to work on if you're accustomed to ThinkPads and Sony Vaio's then you'll welcome the spacious case and modular components. Anyone ready to murder the housecat in frustration after splitting a ThinkPad LCD will fall in love Toshiba's ease of maintenance, the motherboards are  spread out in the base with standard wires and subparts sold at RadioShack.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value!", "Author": "Isaac", "ReviewID": "R2035OO0L93ZDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop for the price--I got mine from Best Buy and only paid 299.00 before tax during the Black Friday week!! I mostly use this for internet browsing, music, reading PDF files, and writing documents. I've had no trouble playing games or watching movies. Programs run fine. The keyboard does feel cheap but I was going to buy an ergonomic one with padding anyway. I also prefer a wireless mouse over any touch pad. I give this a five star rating because that's about as good as it gets for $300.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "There is good news and bad news.", "Author": "Nostromo", "ReviewID": "R1STB6CYKXE7YE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's a good deal with respect to the amount of RAM and hard drive storage space you get for your dollar. The screen is also very bright and clear. However, there are several downsides.The biggest problem that I see is the sound quality, which is very poor, and it is not just the speakers, because it sounds equally bad over headphones. It is the sound card itself, which is very tinny, has no bass response, and according to the Toshiba Forum moderators, cannot be upgraded. So, don't buy this computer to listen to music. Also, the touchpad tray and clickers have a very cheap and unresponsive feel.Access to the DVD tray is troublesome, although with practice you can learn to find the eject button. The mechanism also feels very cheap and flimsy, and it has a design flaw where if you do not hold the DVD or CD very firmly while inserting it into the carriage, it can slide right into the chassis of the computer.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Laptop!", "Author": "Zach Beland \"ZMB\"", "ReviewID": "RR3ZSKG1OK66D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this at BestBuy for $317.99 (including tax) during the Black Friday sale.

The processor is similar to an i3 and it will handle Office, Internet Browsing, HD video, and photo editing with little or no lag. The laptop itself is sturdy - not strong and high-quality - but not flimsy either. Don't expect to run just-released video games on ultra-high settings but it can handle some older games (I'd say 08 and earlier) at medium settings.My gripe with this laptop, and why I am returning it, is the sound quality. It's disgusting. I've never seen sound quality this bad in quite literally any electronic device I've ever used. It's unacceptable for any piece of modern hardware. The speakers are bad, even especially bad for laptop speakers. I'm not expecting some kind of 5.1 audiophile system either, so that in itself is not a fundamental issue. What is a fundamental issue, though, is the sound card. No matter what I listen to with the laptop, it comes out tinny and shallow. There is absolutely no depth or clarity, no matter how much I played with the equalizer. I don't mean that I just can't hear subtle bass lines. I mean that you can't properly hear deep voices in normal conversation or enjoy a song on youtube. Even watching Netflix was a struggle. I plugged my Audio-Technica ATH-M50s in and this laptop successfully made them sound worse than iPod earplugs listening to recordings of 96kbps flash video downloads. It's bad enough that it makes music impossible to enjoy. If you get this laptop you will never enjoy music on it. I promise. My $10 pay-as-you-go flip phone delivers better sound. And from what I'm reading the sound card is not replaceable, which means that regardless of what you plug into this laptop - your cheap earplugs or your $10,000 system, it will sound horrific. I would only recommend this laptop to the office jockey and the deaf. Anyone who is planning on using this laptop for music stay away.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "toshiba", "Author": "Reynold Haywood", "ReviewID": "R1PG5PKJWFRKX7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Always the best in laptop cant complain works great the speed is remarkable especially with windows 8 only thing it should have had touch screen feature.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, fast shipping", "Author": "Zach", "ReviewID": "R3W50EEESJ7ROT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop arrived quick and in perfect condition.

You get everything that windows seven has plus an app store which I like a lot.  By the way you can get the start menu in the app store for free. That is what I did not like at first because I was so just to the start menu but once I got it, was over with.
