After reading all reviews on portable lightweight laptops, I was sold on it.  i5 2410 processor, 4GB RAM, and ~3lb weight were great specs.  I recently noticed it had been discontinued and there was no apparent replacement on Toshiba's website.  That was until Toshiba magically quietly added this new, updated model to their website last week.  The Portege R835 P81 takes an already stout laptop and makes it that much better!  Now it has an i5 2435 processor rated higher and 2 more GB of RAM (to a total of 6GB).  While it only has a 640GB HDD at 5400rpm, it starts up quick and gets going.  I love that it's so light weight and makes my life a ton easier in my day to day operations running my business.  I needed portability since I spend the better part of my day meeting clients at homes and businesses, and this laptop does the job.  I looked into Macbook Airs, Samsung 9 series etc., but nothing beats this computer for the \"bang-for-your-buck\" factor.  I recommend this laptop for anyone that wants a smaller form factor that will last you a long time.", "Date": "October 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Powerful, Lightweight, Reliable, what's not to love?", "Author": "T.

My girlfriend and I broke up and she returned the laptop to me because she doesn't feel comfortable having it anymore. I've sold it on Auction on Ebay for $680.00. This is still a great laptop and I'm truly disappointed I will not get to see it again. I'm thankful for all the positives feedback I've been receiving about this review and I'm very happy to help out. As you can see, the reviews are growing slowly for this laptop so you should feel very confident you won't be disappointed in this laptop.As for my girlfriend and I, we're not talking anymore and she's gone ahead and purchased her own new laptop, a Sony.Update: 11/21/11There was a few problems regarding wifi on this Toshiba where it wouldn't connect to networks that require a password within the browser (workplace or school network where it required your id number/username). We tried using an external wifi adapter via USB and it turned out it still wouldn't connect. I called Amazon and verified with them there seem to be something wrong with the Wifi, it would connect successfully at home or on a mobile hotspot but not at work/school. Amazon was very prompt and got a supervisor approval to send a new replacement laptop with free one day shipping. We tried it out just today at both work and school and now it works just superbly!I'd like to give FIVE STARS to AMAZON for their great customer support, I've been buying from them constantly since 2006 and they've been nothing but fantastic towards treating me like their VIP customer.Besides that, we now have a like new laptop again, and I'm not really concern about moving data back and forth to the hard drive because of my expertise in computers. I've been reading other reviews, yes this laptop is quite delicate but this laptop is so light of course it's going to be fragile! The keyboard seems just fine, it's not an exactly nice finish like a macbook but it's still just a decent keyboard. The webcam has not provide much issue, I webcam with my girlfriend almost every other night and I can hear her clearly and see her clearly just fine. She would even point the webcam at our fish pet and I could see the fish even in low lighting!Currently my girlfriend is a moderate business worker and full time student and this laptop has been nothing but quick, fast, and lightweight for her. Even I'm enjoying playing with it now and then over my White Unibody Macbook.Update: 11/8/11Its been over two weeks. The laptop is still running strong and there hasn't been any problems at all. My girlfriend mentioned during her class someone complimented on her laptop stating that it's so lightweight and you don't see many lightweight laptops with an i5 processor. We purchased this case (attached item name below) and it fits perfectly and very easy to put in and out. There has been no issues with the battery life, it's still very long exactly as stated. The wireless connection has been superb. There has been some Toshiba software that may be bloatware, but half of it is actually useful compared to other laptops. Toshiba really focused on making programs that is truly essential for the user.Case Logic QNS-113 13.3-Inch EVA Molded Laptop Macbook Air/Pro Sleeve (Black)Update: 10/31/11It's been over a week. This laptop has been nothing but fantastic for my girlfriend. No problems whatsoever. Very quick and fast at both starting up and turning off. There was some skeptical questions regarding the battery life. At 90% it said there was 4 hours of battery left, but once it went down to 70% it said there was 6 hours of battery left. Regardless overall depending on the usage, just surfing the internet and doing light word processing it goes beyond seven hours which is plenty of time away from a power outlet.-=[ ~~~ ]=-I'm a very tech savvy person and have worked with all kinds of laptops from Toshiba, Acer, Asus, HP, Compaq, and Apple. I have to say I'm amazed of how great this Portege is, it's definitely lighter than many of their rivals, and it carries an i5 Sandy Bridge processor, and it's equipped with a large amount of ram and hard drive space.From Squaretrade Warranty, Toshiba was rank #2 in reliability in laptops with the least malfunctions after three years, with Asus landing at #1. The reason why I prefer Toshiba is because they only make Netbooks/Laptops in the computing world. All the other brands they make laptops/desktops/all in one pcs. Toshiba however, only focuses on portable computing.I've worked with the previous Portege, the R700 /w the i3 processor. The one thing that blew me away was that it's a 3 pound 13.3 inch laptop. The Macbook Air at the time was lighter but it didn't have an i3 processor. This new updated model though was a great find for me. I was looking around for a new laptop for my girlfriend. She asked for a bigger monitor than her netbook, much faster, and something that would last for a long time.The screen seems pretty reflective in high lighted setting, say outdoor in the sun, this may boast as an issue for some. However, 90% of the usage on a laptop for many users out there is indoor. When using this indoor I see no problem whatsoever. It plays very smoothly HD quality videos with no lag. The brightness is very bright as well, I see myself turning the brightness down mostly and could still see just fine. It's bright enough on medium setting and it's LED.The i5 2.4 ghz processor is one of the latest ones for laptop thats just about right for your everyday multitasking job. It also has a turbo boost technology that could crank it up to speed to 3.0 ghz if it needs to under big work overload. This is useful for those gamers out there or those who want to do photoshop.It has 640gb HD. Usually laptops have 250GB or 320GB but this has 640GB!!! That is twice as big as the average laptop HD size! You will not have to worry for a long time regarding laptop space on this laptop. Trust me, if you're not going to be downloading many movies or plan to put 1,000,000 pictures on this thing, you're going to be really happy wit this large amount of space.6GB of ram, this is what lets you run multiple applications and windows at the same time. 4GB ram seems to be the average of most laptops, so again it goes beyond the standards once again. You can run ten internet windows, watch a movie, and run a webcamming conference and that 6GB of ram will let you run everything just fine without any lag, thanks to that large ram.Only 3.2 pounds. Tats less than a pound more than those really light netbooks out there. Netbooks go for 2.5 pounds, the Portege is at 3.2 pounds, and the Macbook Pro goes for 4.5 pounds. It's very ultraportable and can fit nicely inside your handbag/backpack, it's also very thin as well. This laptop quality is very durable material as well. It's not some cheap plastic material, it's actually well made like a professional. If you didn't know yet, Portege is a business designed laptop.Lastly, with this entire processor, ram, hard drive space, and being ultraportable, how long will the battery last? It says on the standards it should be 9 hours long! That's amazing! I however have heard about tests and from real life tests you'd probably be getting 7 hours of battery  life realistically. But the great part is that Toshiba has the \"ecosaver\" program equipped that really helps conserve the battery longer and helps you measure how much \"watts\" you're using.Overall for the price, this makes a great laptop, and the best part is this just came out quietly this month, October 2011. I plan to update this review as the months go by to see if my girlfriend runs into any problems. But comparing this to my Unibody White Macbook. I think this laptop seems to be much more powerful and faster than mine. It's light weight, powerful with a great processor, up to date on going beyond the standards on RAM and Harddrive space, and long lasting battery life to get you through your day on the go. You won't be disappointed with this purchase.", "Date": "October 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Slow hard drive; Flawed BIOS; Customer support non-existent", "Author": "gtech", "ReviewID": "R2URLP29H8CWEJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm an IT professional and have used tons of laptops. This Toshiba laptop is very light compared to the macbook pro 13'', and has good battery life. Build quality is also good. However, it has some major drawbacks -- its hard drive, BIOS, and customer service.The stock hard drive is 5200rpm which is on the slow side. Besides, Toshiba put lots of redundant software on top of windows 7. The result is that starting windows and some apps takes a long time. One resolution to fix the slowness is to get a SSD to replace the slow hard drive. Now here comes the 2nd drawback -- its BIOS.The SSD I purchased is very fast and supports Sata III. However, the BIOS only supports Sata II which forces the SSD to work at a much lower speed. Note that the Intel chipset built in the laptop does support Sata III; it's just Toshiba's BIOS disabled the Sata III speed. This issue applies to the whole R835 series and has been discussed a lot online. Many people have complained to Toshiba and requested them to enable Sata III.To my surprise, Toshiba decided to ignore customers' feedback and requests. Their CSR is simply not answering customers' questions. It's very simply for them to change the BIOS and enable Sata III, but they simply choose not to do it. Very disappointed w/ their customer service attitude.In summary, the price is simply too high for this handicapped device. Many other laptops at this price fully supports Sata III. Unless they fix the issue, I won't recommend it to anyone who wants to get the speed out of the money they spend (which they deserve for this price).", "Date": "November 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "HDD is slow, Buy an SSD", "Author": "CCK", "ReviewID": "R18FLH2G9XEUH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi,If your wondering about getting this laptop, well, just go ahead and get it because it's great.(I own the R835-P56x, very similar)BUT! Here's a few things you need to be aware of.Pros:-Super Light-Great battery life(over 6-7hr on mine)-Eco Mode actually works, brings power consumption to 9-11watts-Fast CPU, Windows movie maker takes care of 720p content easily.-Feels great, keyboard is fine with me.-Plays Dirt 3 at 720p on med-high settings. Portal 2 on high at 1080p. Using .2559 Driver-DVD drive in such a small laptop, it doesn't use the battery hardly at all.Cons:-Display doesn't WOW-The hard drive is flippin slow. Buy a $120 120GB ssd from newegg.com. I got the Intel 320 series for 120 after rebate. Windows experience index now 7.7-RAM, 4 is ok but I got ADATA XPG Gaming Series 8GB from Newegg.com WEI now 7.5-Speakers are absolute crap but it's a 3LB laptop so I can't complain. The headphone jack puts out amazing quality.***** BlOATWARE is terrible **** - The first thing I did was find my student copy of windows 7 and installed that from scratch. You do NOT want Toshiba's recovery crap installed on an SSD.-The mouse left and right are noisy but you can just double click in the trackpad. Also put up the sensitivity of the pad in the settings.-SATA 3 disabled by Toshiba BIOS, 2 is more reliable anywayThat about sums it up. BTW, the bios startup is wicked fast, especially with an SSD. Go ahead and laugh at the macbook pro next to you.Drivers you will need to download after a fresh install of Win:-Toshiba Value Added(To make the keyboard functions work)-Realtec Audio Drivers(I got them from realtec), windows standard drivers work too-USB 3.0 Driver(From toshiba)-Intel Raid Storage Technogy(MUST download from toshiba), it doesn't come out of sleep properly if not installed.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Lightweight", "Author": "William H Frieswyk", "ReviewID": "R3CEFHEUEFUTTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the Toshiba P25 Portege  for the last 18 month's.

Considering that I used to have a Dell E1505, which I affectionately referred to as \"The Brick,\" this computer is a wonderful replacement.  Its lightweight and so far very durable.  Don't be pessimistic about the battery life!  It really does last just about that long!  I took my new laptop on a recent vacation, and after watching a 2.5 hour movie on a flight, I still had about 5.5 hours of battery life left after the movie ended.  The battery life was a huge selling point of this laptop for me, and I'm glad that it has been as advertised.I had read previously that Toshiba's don't have the greatest screens, but I haven't noticed that at all with this computer.  It is very sharp!The only complaints I would have are 1) too many pre-loaded Toshiba apps, but this isn't really a problem.  More like an irritation, but it doesn't take away from the computer.  and 2) Maybe I'm just inept in some way, but I only see 2 USB ports.  Toshiba advertised 4 on this computer, and Amazon advertised 3.  But, I still only see 2.

There aren't a lot of choices in that niche, and they tend to be a lot more expensive. But people still give me a fair amount of things in the form of DVDs or CDs, and I wanted to be able to use them without having to plug in an external drive.I've only had this one a few days as yet (bought from Amazon at $799, oddly the price has gone up a bit since then). I was convinced to buy by the i5 processor update, the big 6 RAM update, the huge-capacity hard disk. I had been hesitating between this and the Z series one, without the built in drive and lighter, but ended up with this--for anyone who doesn't care about DVD/CD drive, the Z would be the way to go, the best bargain currently around, it looks to me, for a 2.4 lb computer.I am completely happy with this machine so far. Nice feel, big screen compared to my former HP 10\" netbook. I don't have any complaints except that the optical disk drive carriage does seem a bit flimsy--the plastic snap-on outer edge came off while I was making the Recovery Disks, and the whole thing feels a bit fragile; but at least edge bit did snap right back into place. While I've not yet tried this out with my portable printer, I also like that this machine has multiple USB ports (three, including a new 3.0 one) and ethernet port, in case I ever need that for a hotel. For reliably doing actual work while travelling, this is still, for me at least, a far better choice than a tablet or iPad, even with the add-on keyboard, because of the standard ports, SD card reader, and so on. (Though for trips when I'll only need a bit of email and web access, I'm waiting on the next, larger-screened Kindle Fire we've been told might be coming.)I notice that another reviewer spoke of a noisy fan. I do think that fans are one of those things that vary a lot between individual computers--I've had other laptops with loud ones--but this one, for me, is virtually silent.Overall--nice keyboard, nice size, screen seems great for how I used it, and a truly fully loaded computer in a lightweight vehicle. So far I'm delighted every time I open the cover and use it. BIG leap upward from the 10\" netbook I was using before--much faster processor and big RAM is making a difference even for normal use with the web, and the start-up after hibernation is pretty much instantaneous.

It is faster, weighs only half of the Apple and I don't have software issues anymore. I have to use Windows software and to run it with Parallels slowed the MacBookPro down to a point where you could not work with it anymore.  The Apple operating system is a pain if you go outside writing a single letter and listening to music.  If you have a bunch of windows open, Windows 7 gives you a preview at the taskbar (I oftentimes have >5 PDF's open), at this point Mac OS is clearly not user friendly, not to mention the keyboard shortcuts you have to know.  I should have read the following article before making a decision:  [...]At home I have a 27\" Samsung Monitor that I use with my Toshiba (compare two letter size windows side by side, HDMI connection, more upright seating position) and a wireless keyboard.  This is a much better configuration for me, since I work many hours on a computer every day.The Toshiba has a USB 3.0 and a eSATA for fast backup if needed.  The USB 3.0 stopped working, which is a driver issue and can be fixed by installing the new driver.  The keyboard is nice but keys are somewhat slippery, which I can get used to when on the road.

I sometimes connect it to my HD TV to watch movies, etc., but have also watched quite a few hours of streaming video on the 13 inch screen.  The screen seems a bit fragile (depresses a bit in the middle when closed) - but this is to be expected with such a light machine.  No issues over the past 1 \u00bd months, but I am careful and always travel with it in a laptop sleeve.- No backlit keyboard or Bluetooth (understandable for the price point).  It took me a few hours to get used to typing on the chicklet style keyboard, but now have no issues.  Keystrokes are also a bit load.- Trackpad buttons are loud (and more difficult to depress than the past two laptops I've owned).  However, this is not much of an issue as I mostly tap to select when using the trackpad.- Horrible sound from built-in speakers (not a deal-breaker for me as I mostly use headphones, external speakers)- Toshiba bloatwareOverall:I'm giving this laptop 4 stars as I feel that this laptop presents a great value given its excellent performance (particulary with SSD) and portability.  I paid $699 for the laptop and $185 for an Intel 320 Series 120 GB SSD.  The total cost of my system was approx.. $885, which approaches the Portege ultrabook, but includes a Core-i5 processor, 6 GB of RAM, a wide array of ports, an optical drive, and ultrabook/MacBook Air-like quickness, but comes in a bit of a thicker form factor.  I did use it for a few days without the SSD and was still happy with the performance, but thought that the 5400 RPM hard drive did not pair well with the Sandy Bridge processor.  Once you've used a SSD, it's hard to go back!With the SSD startup is fast (16 seconds to log in screen; 9 seconds from log in to loaded desktop with wifi connected), shutdown is fast (8 seconds), and programs load extremely quickly (e.g., MS Office Suite and web browsers are almost instantaneous).I would give this laptop 5 stars if a few things could be improved (if only slightly): the screen, built-in speakers, and keyboard (see above).  However, I think these are fairly minor issues and have not had an impact on my regular usage of the machine.  Also, while the included hard drive has a lot of space (640 GB) I found it to be a little bit slow.Overall, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a lightweight and portable, well-built and fast laptop.  I'd recommend replacing the hard drive with an SSD if you are able to get a good deal on the laptop.

What convinced me was the fact that this model was about the same weight and dimensions, yet included a built-in DVD burner; as compared to the other system which had no burner.What I don't like:  I really wish it had 3 USB ports, but I can get by with 2.  I also dislike the power jack, which protrudes out and tends to always be in the way.  It really should have been a right angle jack. Lastly, the Lan port is in an odd position on the side, and upside down compared to most others I have seen.The weight and battery life are superb.I haven't really timed it, but I am sure I am getting close to 8 hours with very light usage.  The hard drive protection system is extremely sensitive, and the unit has a pretty solid feel considering the light weight. While I do use this mainly for business, I don't consider myself a \"power user\", so I cannot adequately address the criticisms of speed which some reviewers have pointed out.  I would think you will need some type of performance rating program or big video game to even tell the difference between models today.  So if you are working with a spreadsheet, have Outlook open and running, and maybe writing a Word document at the same time, this unit will serve you well.

I did not buy this one, I purchased the Toshiba R835-P94 instead. The P94 is the same computer except the P94 also has Bluetooth and is over $100 cheaper. The P94 is an Amazon exclusive, which probably accounts for the lower price. The P81 comes with 6 GB of ram while the P94 only has 4 GB. The 4 GB of ram is fine for most applications and most users, but I like to max-out my ram. I bought two 4 GB high speed ram modules (a total of 8 GBs) for $46 and the P94 is noticeably faster. Installation of the ram is very easy.A real shocker was discovering that the battery power lasts almost as long as advertised. Amazing! I have never had a laptop that even came close to this one.I'm not a \"gamer\" so I can't speak to its capabilities in that arena, but I have watched streaming movies, and DVD's with no problems. The only negative things that I have noticed so far are that it has a narrow vertical viewing angle. I'm comparing it to my old Sony Vaio which has a larger and very good screen. The other negative is the ton of bloat ware programs that Toshiba loads on the computer. I doubt that you will ever use the majority of them.

I based my purchase on a good experience with a prior Toshiba and an excellent review on Cnet.com for the laptop. It was a great deal on Amazon.  I considered the new Toshiba Z835 Ultrabook but decided on this laptop because it had a faster chip (i-5), a better keyboard for typing (I found the Z835 keyboard to be cheap and flimsy) and a better value. The R835 offers great bang for the buck and I am glad that I bought it.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "powerful computer system rolled into one tiny package.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2SJI4KQ4CVXWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this item yesterday so I can't really say that I have tested this system to it's limit just yet.Initial impressions leaves me coming away impressed.Of course the first boot up was painful to say the least.I can honestly say this is the most amount of crapware I've seen preloaded onto a notebook.After creating a system recovery disc, I immediately reinstalled a fresh copy of windows 7 professional 64bits onto this.After that everything was just perfect.Boot up times were relatively fast,(for a 5400rpm HDD system)I believe that this note book will really shine with a SSD, which is why I will be purchasing and installing one very soon, hopefully around next week.Battery life is insanely good. I can easily last 7-8 hours with this with general computering tasks such as excel, word and powerpoint.The screen on this notebook was fine, though I wish that it would come with a matte screen instead.However, for the audio department as many other others before me had commented, the speakers are the most horrible teeniest thing I've ever heard in my life.I also wish that this thing would come with a backlit keyboard as I personally find backlit keyboard to be incredibly useful.But I guess there is only so much that Toshiba can give us for 749.99 right?", "Date": "January 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love my ugy duckling", "Author": "PJ", "ReviewID": "RB18V6LEKAWGT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Electronics and I frequently don't get along, but from the second I pulled this kind of ugly little computer from the box it was love, from it's brushed steel facade to it's weird CSI font keyboard.It's the only one I found well under $1,000 at such a small size and weight with such a powerful processor. I like to do a lot of things at once and become inordinately angry over things like freezing programs, jumpy video playback, and waiting for things to open and load. I plug this little guy into a big HD TV and it runs streaming HD content effortlessly, even while I have 5 other things running at the same time. I can't speak for gaming, but for Windows programs and streaming video, this computer performs really well.It also has a monster hard drive compared to everything else I was looking at, which is great to have all that storage space available as files and programs keep getting bigger.I saw some reviews here from more tech-savvy people about this type of hard drive performing slowly, but speaking as a non-tech specialist who uses a fancy brand new imac all day at work, no functions of this computer have seemed slow whatsoever.It has 3 USB ports, 1 VGA, 1 HDMI, a card reader, and a CD/DVD burner that I have yet to use. I find the track pad very easy to use. The keys are a little smaller than usual (slightly rectangular) but the keyboard is very easy to type on. The battery life is great; I'm getting 3-4 hours with constant media playing, 6-7 hours typing and web browsing. It's really lightweight. I had it in my backpack and dropped the backpack on the concrete sidewalk a few weeks ago; so far so good.Cons: Well, nobody's perfect. Ok, the speakers definitely do suck. There is a keyboard control for mute/un-mute, but not for adjusting the volume. The display is not great - the colors are a little washed out on the screen. It comes with a lot of crap on it (like most computers these days). It's fatter than other similar laptops because it has an optic drive (but not heavier).I'm so glad I sent back the adorable, crappy HP I ordered first and traded it for this industrial-looking awesomesauce computer.

The strength of the case compared to previous Portege which cost twice as much is excellent and the light weight (about 3 lbs.) a joy.  Thinness and feel and look are all great and make it a pleasure to pull it out of a case at a meeting or anywhere else.  Speed of everything I do is fine and I often load it up with 4-5 intensive programs.  I did notice a small crack on the screen shortly after I got it which was like a hairline about 1\" long, showing no apparent cause but Toshiba would not cover fixing it.  Since it didnt affect the use of the screen, I've just left it there since it seemed to cause no other problem.  Still, after paying for a new computer, it would seem they should consider that it might be a mfg defect.  They didn't even consider it.On their repair system: I cant work without my computer for a week or two so it can be fixed, if necessary.  Thats what they do OR take it to my local authorized repair place, which has since disappeared.  So I hope I never have to get a repair.  Toshiba should have a better solution for business computer repairs.  Maybe they do?  Best ask them.When I bought it from Amazon, it arrived with a slightly smaller hard drive than was specified in their ad, so I contacted them and was given an immediate price adjustment that satisfied me.I opened up an Amazon Charge card (GE) for this purchase and had a year with no interest and just paid off the balance so there was no interest charge.  The bad part - this card would charge $25 for a late fee on a $25 payment a day or two late.  While that was very high, it should be noted that a call to them would often get it forgiven - obviously, I had gotten the payment there late a few times to learn this.  I wont use this card again because it has a 25% interest rate, for some reason, which is almost an insult and seems that GE and Amazon are almost hoping you screw up so they can catch you and say - opps, you now have a 25% interest rate.  Offsetting that feeling on my part, they didnt actually do that and every statement warned up front of the payoff date to get the no interest for a year.  Bottom line, I would be careful of the terms on this Amazon card, and use it carefully and only where there was no interest being paid.Bottom line grades: Amazon A, Toshiba Product A, Toshiba Support B, GE B+", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Ever", "Author": "John Martin", "ReviewID": "R3V0EFY1ZGLEDR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Dell Quosmio laptop died.

I called Toshiba Support and after a 20 minute HOLD, I spent 1 1/2 hours with the Tech on the Blue Screen/ 'wheel scroll' problem. Finally I was told that the software was NOT covered by the 1 year warranty and that I would have to pay $100 to actually fix both problems. That's just not right. I checked with MS and they say that if the MS Software was installed by the Manufacturer,(Toshiba), they support the software. I can't return it to Amazon because the 30 day Return Policy.
