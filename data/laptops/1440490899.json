I now own 2 chrome books (one for my wife and one for me) and find the experience delightful. In trying to learn and become more productive with it, I have searched the web for how-to articles, etc. Quite by accident, I came across \"The Chrome Book.\" It is well written, very informative, and a real good overview of the \"operating system.\" It also treats some of the higher level uses.This was my best find yet, and one that I am buying as a reference book. I just hope Google keeps going with this concept with enhancements, improvements, and more advertising. Again, well written book and on target!", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent!!", "Author": "Poor  Audiophile \"Poor  Audiophile\"", "ReviewID": "RAM6A980S6YMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great intro. to the subject of Chromebooks!It's helping me decide if I want to take the plunge(I probably will).Update(7/16/12): I took the plunge!

I purchased Andriod and iPad, looking for the perfect flexible, easy to use PC replacement.  No luck. Even a Bluetooth keyboard its not enough to replace the PC as a heavy typing/real work tool.So I purchased a Samsung 5 550.  I already used Google Apps extensively, and this was a natural extension.CH Rome's book gave me a fantastic look into the concepts and methods of using ChromeOS, as well as a detailed step-by-step method for using it.  It actually changed how I use computers.  My 'My Documents\" folder is now my Google Drive folder and I have file access from my PC, Chromebook, iPhone, iPad, and any PC I log into.I use the Chromebook as the heavy typing tool now, as its so fast and easy to start and stop, and stay where I was. I use a wireless mouse with it, and it feels so comfortable!  I could not have known all these capabilities were there without the book.  I can honestly say that less than $6 and a few hours of reading changed a huge aspect of my life.  Not many books can boast that claim.", "Date": "September 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not useful if you know about the Internet", "Author": "KWL", "ReviewID": "R6GIPSHI7QUUY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Disappointed.  I bought this after I got my ARM-based Samsung Chromebook to learn more about ChromeOS and how to make the best use of my new laptop.  I wish I had just used Wikipedia and an Internet search engine and saved myself the time and money.  If you know how to use the Google Chrome web browser and Google Docs then you are ahead of the game already.  Highly recommend the Samsung Chromebook for a netbook computer but the dated information in the book leaves much to be desired.
