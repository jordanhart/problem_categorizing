{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I guess I am a Mac after all...", "Author": "H. A.", "ReviewID": "RQHMF0YIR7TMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently made the switch from PC to Mac, and I can say that I'm not sure why I waited so long.  Considering that I have only had my computer a few weeks I can't say much about the durability and longevity of the hardware, but I can say that the operating system (mine shipped with Lion) and software is top notch.I labored for a long time trying to decide whether the 13\" MacBook Pro (MBP) or MacBook Air was the right choice for me.  I liked the form factor, screen resolution and weight of the Air, but couldn't get comfortable with the comparatively small hard drive and the RAM fixed at 4GB.  Considering these factors along with the significant price premium for an Air, I decided that the MBP was right for me.I also thought long and hard about whether to go with the base model with the 2.4Ghz i5 processor and 500 GB HDD or the 2.8Ghz i7 processor with the 750GB HDD.  after looking at reviews and benchmark tests I decided that for my uses, the less expensive model would be perfect and that the incremental added performance of the more expensive model is not worth the additional cost.  When large solid state drives become more affordable I will probably switch my HDD out, but until then 500GB should provide plenty of storage.I opted to get my computer locally, but purchased the Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2KIT51264BC1339) from Amazon for a great price.  Once I got my computer home I installed the RAM in 10 minutes, start to finish.  If you are planning this upgrade just be sure that you have the right Phillips head screwdriver.After using this computer for the past few weeks and carrying it on weekly business trips I am very pleased with my choice of computers.  It handles the Microsoft office suite flawlessly, and the added ram allows me to open and view very large pdf files without any lag.  I have done minor video and photo editing on this computer and it performed very well.  The added weight compared to theAir hasn't proven to be too noticeable, but I am a big guy at 6'4\" and 210 pounds.So far I am pleased with this computer and my Mac experience overall.  The process of learning a new OS and overall user interface was daunting at first, but Apple has done a great job creating a system that is intuitive and easy to learn.I would recommend this computer to anyone looking for a new laptop that they expect to have for awhile and would like to be able to customize to fit their needs.UPDATE 5/29/12: I have been using my MBP for six months now and couldn't be happier with it.  I may have been lucky enough to get a great unit, but during the time that I have owned my MBP I have NEVER needed to contact technical support.  I use my Mac for my primary business computer every day and have traveled extensively with it.Aside from its performance and reliability the feature that I like most about my Mac is the multi-touch trackpad.  By using gestures on the trackpad I can be very efficient, and I'm not sure that I will ever be able to go back to a regular mouse or trackball.One addition that I made was to get the Mini DisplayPort to DVI Adapter MB570Z/A to attach a second monitor when I'm at the office.  This allows me to use both my MBP monitor and an external, which provides me with much more area when using Excel or other programs and also allows me to keep my mailbox visible when working on other things.Considering how pleased I am with my Mac, I have a feeling that I will be buying a lot more Apple products in the future.", "Date": "December 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "MD 314LL/A 2.8 GHz, 750 GB HDD", "Author": "Steelers Fan", "ReviewID": "R3PU0HQTGMMP6N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The reviews here are for the MD313LL/A, yet the computer is actually MD314LL/A, which has a faster processor and bigger hard drive.The MD314LL/A features a 2.8 GHz i7 processor, integrated Intel 3000 graphics and a 750 GB hard drive.  I've never owned an Apple laptop before, so there was a little bit of a learning curve.  Now that I'm getting the hang of it, I'm beginning to like OSX Lion better than Windows.  Programs can be run on separate virtual desktops, and the computer never misses a beat when several programs are active.  Switching between different desktops or open programs can be done by merely sliding three fingers forward on the large touchpad.  Control-clicking on words or phrases in Safari brings up a context sensitive menu which allows the user to select to view a dictionary, Wikipedia, or do a Google search in a pop-up window in the browser. You can also ask the computer to speak the word or phrase, if you have any doubts about pronunciation.  Safari also includes links to a library of plug-ins at extensions.apple.com, which includes a plug-in for Flash, so you can now watch free Hulu videos and other videos online.  The network preferences window makes it far easier than Windows to set up a list of public DNS servers to bypass the sometimes slow, glitchy ISP servers.This computer is completely silent. I wasn't even sure it had a cooling fan until I downloaded a utility to monitor the fan speed.  This computer is super fast, and the base plate never gets more than lukewarm.  The light weight, small footprint, lighted keyboard, crisp screen and speed really make this computer shine.The attention to detail is really outstanding.  The cooling vents on the back of the base are completely covered by a sliding plate when the lid is closed, keeping dust out of the innards. The power supply has flip out legs for winding the cord for storage and the prongs can be removed so it can be used as a brick type supply with the supplied AC cord. The computer also has a green LED battery status gauge built into the left side of the base, which is activated by a flush button.  The lid snaps shut quietly even though there are no cheesy stick-on rubber bumpers, and it is held closed by magnets. The built in light sensor shuts off the keyboard backlighting and brightens the display in bright ambient light. The computer also has a 3 axis accelerometer to protect the hard drive from damage. The attention to detail is why Macs are more expensive than the various PC clones.", "Date": "November 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "No More Windows for Me!", "Author": "J.

I was very impressed how well this thing was packaged. A well thought-out design protects the content and minimizes customer dissatisfaction.First impression:I am sure everyone who are interested to buy this product, has gone to best buy and played with it a bit. well, the new MBP right out of the box is 90% more impressive and attractive than that of the store. It is a good looking piece of machine.It came with a charger, extension cord for the charger, instruction book, screen wipe, and nothing more that I needed. I took the cord out, and started charging it. A full charging is highly recommended before use. after a few setup screens, I am up and running.Upgrade time:(Make sure you shut down your machine first)I ordered this machine with a 8GB memory upgrade (DDR3-1333) from Crucial. I did not want to pay a premium for the apple upgrade. Instead, I bought a dual channel kit separately for $39.00. I highly recommended Crucial brand as they use Samsung memory chips and for one more reason I am telling you next. I will not go through how to change the memory(a lot of youtube videos available). when I took out the existing memory out of the MBP, guess what chips they use on the memory sticks? yes, guessed it right, samsung.And I also have reasons to believe that the RAMs are OEM version of crucial memory judging by physical similarities. but, that is just my opinion, not a fact.User Experience:After the upgrade, turned on the machine and few beeps and clunks later, it started flying. I repeat, it is flying and my machine is currently running over 600 threads without any sign of slowing down. virtual box? NO PROBLEMO! this little beauty is a little beast in performance. I have installed over 50 applications, running dozens simultaneously, 10 more browser windows open, and it just happy. I can't say enough about the multi-touch gestures. No other laptop I have ever used that had such ease of switching between applications, scrolling, searching, sliding  and navigating. I have never used Mac OS before(not more than a few minutes of playing around at best buy), and I felt it was very intuitive to use and learned fairly quickly. I still don't know a lot about the OS, but it has not stopped me from doing what I need to do.What could be better:Not that I cared much, but the standard power cord is a little short. I bought a sleeve to keep it safe, and it does not allow room for the extension cord that comes with it(big and bulky).It has good speakers that play nice sounding beats. But the 15\" plays them better.The outer shell is aluminium, but don't think you can't scratch it. I spent a sleepless night just cause it put a small scratch under it by accident. But, I am over it now.Advice to the people who wants to take the plunge:I felt like it was the best $1100 I spent on a laptop. I could not justify it before using it as I always thought that Mac is more style than performance and usefulness. I admit that I was wrong. This machine offers more features and performance per dollar than I thought. This is a well-built machine that would serve me longer than any other laptop ever has for me. I have half a dozen windows machines in my house including a 990X extreme desktop that I built 4 months ago. I love windows, but I have learned that I can like both (Macbook pro and PC).", "Date": "December 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "MacBook Pro: Think Different", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "R19J6AYWHH36KO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Steve Jobs had returned to Apple, which had been a struggling company, and it was time to align it once again with world of creative users.  In 1997 an ad was run with actor Richard Dreyfuss reading the voiceover, which began with: \"Here's to the Crazy Ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently.\" Think Different... that was the 1997 slogan and theme for Apple's comeback to the world of serious computing after the return of Steve Jobs, and perhaps it was a cynical reference to IBM's famous \"Think\" slogan.  Whatever it was, this was the ad campaign that restored Apple's reputation under the leadership of the late Steve Jobs.Take this MacBook Pro review as one from a dedicated Windows PC user who made the switch awhile ago, with time enough to put it through its paces, to do side-by-side comparisons.  I've owned a Mac before, back in the day of the Macintosh SE, and though I found it to be extremely useful for desktop publishing in the days when Aldus PageMaker reigned supreme in that area, I saw things blend as Microsoft slowly got its act together, for the most part.  When it came time to upgrade back then, I stuck with the Windows PCs... until recently, when I found the need to diversify a bit.To make this easy for those who just want to get to the facts quickly, I'll list the positive and negative points that I've personally found with the MacBook Pro first, then elaborate with details a bit further on.  Please also remember that these are coming from a satisfied Windows 7 PC user, and one with multiple computers.\u25c6 MacBook Pro Positives:+ Well thought-out packaging, easy out of the box setup+ Excellent build quality, unparalleled detail in workmanship+ Superb aluminum unibody chassis construction, has a good solid feel+ Sharp 13.3-Inch backlit display, first-rate 1280-by-800 Resolution+ Screen display has excellent color resolution and contrast for photos+ First class backlit keyboard, easy to use in low-light situations+ Very fast boot up even with password protection enabled+ Proven Mac OS X operating system; based on UNIX (like a server)+ Built-in SD card slot; great for transferring photos to computer+ Responsive ergonomic multi-touch trackpad; no buttons, excellent cursor control+ Well-engineered 60W power adapter with decent cable management system+ Automated incremental backups with Time Machine, works with almost any external HDD\u25c6 In Between:\u00b1 Claimed 7 hour battery life; 5-6 hours is more like it, depending on the apps that you're running\u25c6 Negatives:- No built-in HDMI or VGA output, adapters must be purchased separately- Only 2 USB 2.0 ports, and they are too close together\u25c6 The Details:We each have our reasons for the computers that we own.  Mine were primarily to have a compact yet sturdy platform for word processing, accessing the Internet, and digital photo processing.  That stated, there's little to not like about this MacBook Pro.  The Intel Dual-Core Processor is fast and efficient, and even better than the Pentium Dual-Core 2.20GHz processor on my Windows 7 notebook PC.  It's one thing to see it in the store, but when one gets it home and takes it out of the well-designed box, it's apparent that this is a better grade computer than might have been anticipated.  The first thing that is noticed once it's unwrapped is the workmanship.  The unibody main enclosure, constructed from a single block of aluminum, is proof of this attention to detail and it helps add to its durability.The 13-inch backlit LCD display is sharp, and has the excellent color resolution and contrast that I need, especially when working with photos.  The glossy screen actually helps to see images with their full clarity.  Using both Adobe software apps and Nikon Capture NX 2, having clear and sharp resolution is an absolute necessity, and this MacBook Pro offers that.  The backlit keyboard is a pleasure to use, and quite functional in low-light mobile locations.  I'm also very impressed with the quick boot up, even with the password startup screen enabled, a security necessity when at some mobile locations.It's hard to fault OS X in any way.  This operating system is UNIX-based, and therein lays its strength, along with its ability to run 64-bit applications.  It works right out of the box without fiddling or tweaking.  It's far better than Mac OS 9 and its predecessors, and the security while on the `Net is reassuring.The tiny built-in SD card slot has proven itself to be good for transferring photos from the digital cameras to the computer.  I've also used it to transfer other media files and documents between computers in a pinch.  It took awhile to get used to the trackpad, with its so-called \"multi-touch gestures,\" but once mastered it's easy to use.  Must admit that I do revert to using a mouse when using the computer at home... call it years of conditioning.This computer really shines with the inclusion of the Time Machine application, and I was happy to find that I could use a reasonable priced off-the-shelf hard drive to do automated incremental backups.  I have a Toshiba 500 GB USB Portable Hard Drive, and all I did was reformat it to HFS+ Journaled file system to use the Time Machine backup software.  It works like a champ.The external 60W power adapter is well engineered and keeps my computer running cooler than PC notebooks with internal power supplies.  I appreciate the magnetic DC connector as it pops off easily if some klutz trips on the cord, necessitating a costly repair as I found out when someone did that to one of my PC notebooks.  The LED in the connector head helps: amber it's charging, green it's charged; very simple and effective.\u25c6 Other Notes:The battery life being less than advertised I can live with.  I would have expected HDMI and/or VGA output to be built-ins with a computer of this quality.  But I have yet to buy the adapters.  But to have only two built-in USB 2.0 ports is irritating, and those are too close together.  Problem solved with an external 4-port ISB adapter, so that issue is closed.I have had issues with laptop carrying bags in the past, and now carry my MacBook Pro in a ThinkTank Artificial Intelligence 15 V. 2.0 Laptop Bag.  I picked this one over many others from heavy experience with photo gear, and know that Think Tank makes exceptionally good pro gear.  It protects my computer from the elements quite well, holds more gear than I can explain here (I have reviewed it), and can highly recommend it to anyone who wants to protect their MacBook with the kind of case that it really deserves.Browser note: I've used the included Safari browser, but my de-facto standard remains Google Chrome.  Safari is a decent browser, but because I find it necessary to synchronize my email on the Mac, the PCs and even one older Linux-based notebook (it's a geek/support thing), Chromes just works better, and I find it faster.  Your experiences may differ, so try whichever works for you.I'm running Office for Mac 2011 and have found its interface to be even better than Microsoft Office 2010 or 2007 on the PC.  Didn't know if the implementation of Outlook for Mac 2011 would be better than Entourage, which was buggy, but Outlook turned out to be excellent, and it's become my mainstay over the PC version.Heat is an issue that I had heard of by some, yet I have not experienced.  The heat level is better than my old HP, Compaq or Dell, and far better than my VAIO (which was very bad).  The only one that has been better heat-wise is my current ASUS notebook running Windows 7, but not by much.  Had been tempted to get a keyboard skin for general protection in the field, but heard that these interfere with the ventilation, so that idea has been tabled for the present.\u25c6 Future:I may upgrade to 8GB of RAM, which has been recommended by a number of people if and when system performance issues arise.  The RAM upgrades are quite reasonable, but I'm pleasantly surprised at how well it runs with the standard 4 GB at this point.\u25c6 [Updated 3/10/2014]This MacBook Pro has been in continuous use for over two years now. In the summer of 2012 I did the memory upgrade to 8GB of RAM using the Crucial 8GB (4GBx2) Kit in anticipation of the OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) release. Detailed notes of what I did can be found on my review of that Crucial 8GB kit, which my be helpful to first-timers. Have also been doing the OS X upgrades, usually about 2 - 3 weeks after they were released to see what bugs may have been encountered. Currently the computer is running the OS X 10.9.2 (Mavericks) update, and though I went through some hiccups with the initial OS X 10.9 release, OS X 10.9.2 has been running fine on this computer.Am using the Time Machine backup software application in conjunction with a Seagate Expansion 1TB Portable External USB 3.0 Hard Drive which has been partitioned; one segment is for automatic backups, and the other segment is reserved for manually saving photo, MP3 and video files. The main thing is to let the Time Machine do your backups automatically as a security measure.\u25c6 In Conclusion...I could say more, but the best advice that I can offer is that if you get a MacBook Pro, regardless of which model, take it out of the box, plug it in and charge it.  After that, turn it on and see how easy it can be... the MacBook Pro just works, as you'll see.  Think Different is a reality, and this one proves it.JW \u25aa 1/30/2012; Updated 3/10/2014", "Date": "January 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Switching to OS X from Windows 7 ?", "Author": "R. Kavuri", "ReviewID": "R21IAPUYZ0FXQG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Please note that this is a review for the February 2011 model but I am posting it here since the configuration is almost the same. (also because more people could read this before buying a MBP)I have been a Windows user since I started using a computer and I never used a Mac OS X till I actually bought a MBP in May 2011. So, this review would really help someone who is considering a Mac for the first time and wants to use it either at school or to remotely connect to work. This article summarizes what you would love and what you could be missing.I previously owned a desktop, a HP laptop and a Compaq laptop before I bought a MBP. Also, I still use Windows machine at work. One of the major reasons I bought the MBP was because it was available on a eBay deal from Macmall for $950. I assumed that if I did not like it, I could always sell it for at least $850 on eBay or Craigslist.Before reading the next part, please do understand that MBP and OS X come together. Things you need to know --**OS XSwitching between applications - This is one of my biggest quirks with OS X. Windows 7 does an awesome job in switching between applications. When you want to switch between the applications, you use ALT+TAB in Windows 7 and this would shift the focus to the next application. In OS X, you can switch between applications by using CMD+TAB but it does not automatically bring up the other application, it just changes the active application in menu bar (if the application was minimized). I never understood the reasoning behind this, why would I just want to see the menu bar of the other application, I cannot imagine doing anything just with a menu bar.After some search on the internet I found the work around to do this in OS X. The answer is to press CMD+TAB followed by the option key (just before releasing the CMD key)  to switch between the applications perfectly. You can also scroll your four fingers on the track pad to bring up all the applications and then highlight the application you want to choose  to change the active application window.  It is simply irritating to switch between keyboard and the track pad when you are typing some document or email. You can also use one of the function key buttons instead of using the four fingers but at the end of the day Windows 7 does a great job here.Please do note that you can only switch directly between applications but not directly to the active window of an application when you used CMD+TAB, for example you cannot switch directly to a second excel workbook, you have to bring up the application first and only then switch to the second workbook. I am aware that there is software available (namely Witch for $14) to do this but I already paid for the machine and why should I go through all this trouble and change the system registry entries to simply switch between applications.-->UPDATE We can also use spaces and assign some shortcuts to spaces(like option+arrow) to make the switch between applications easier but you need to assign a different space to every application and this could be tedious after some time. Also the animations could make you dizzy after a while.Switching within an application - To switch between the various windows of the same application, the answer is to press CMD+~, it works but what if I have 3 open excel workbooks. Same answer as above, scroll the four fingers or press the function key to see all active windows.Taskbar could be a big deal - It is irritating not to have a task bar in OS X. You can never actually know that you had two open excel workbooks or two separate browser windows at a glance. To put this into context, try working in Windows 7 grouping all your applications together all the time, in Windows 7 the users have the option to ungroup individual windows by selecting \"Combine only when taskbar is full\" in the taskbar properties. The problem with this approach in OS X is that you will never know all the application windows unless you display all the active windows or highlight the application in the docking bar.Also, the docking bar still occupies a substantial amount of screen space even in its minimal size , in Windows 7 the taskbar is comparively small. Due to the screen size and resolution constraints we usually tend to hide this docking bar on the 13\" MBP so that we can see the applications in the maximum available screen space. So either compromise on seeing the active applications in docking bar or full screen mode for applications.Again, the app Witch is the answer for taskbar but it will display these active windows only when we press CMD+TAB.Full Screen - I am addicted to see everything in maximized window mode in Windows 7 machines, I could never be satisfied with the default resized small windows, so I installed a free application RightZoom to address this issue. So far, so good.Microsoft Office - The experience of using Microsoft Office on OS X is pretty subpar in comparison to Windows 7, may be it the fault of Microsoft but it is simply pretty hard for someone to transition from Office 2010 in Windows 7 to Office 2011 in OS X. For example, I am used to zooming in and out of Microsoft Word using Ctrl+Scroll Up(on trackpad) and Ctrl+Scroll Down but this option is not available as shortcut in the OS X version of Office. I wanted to type a formula for a cell in Excel and cannot find the formula bar. May be someone can help me if they know a way around enhancing this experience.Quick Links - The docking bar essentially acts likes the quick link shortcuts in Windows  7. CMD+W closes the application and CMD+Q quits the application, you have to be careful enough not to press Q instead of W.Delete button - There is no substitute to Shift+Delete in OS X(CMD+del). Deletion followed by emptying trash is the only way to do it, if you are someone who is addicted to deleting the file at once there is no shortcut.Cut + Paste - There is no such option as 'Cut+Paste' in OS X. If you want to move something to a different folder, you have to copy and paste the file into the target folder and then delete the original from the source folder. Or select the file and carefully drag the file from the source into the target folder.Preview - Preview can be used to view PDF files and image files. Preview can also be used to make some markings in a PDF file, that is pretty cool. But what if I want to see all the pictures in a folder at once using preview, the only option is to select all the images and then right click to open with preview to see the files (In certain situations we can select all images and press space bar and the photos come in a stream slideshow, I learned this recently. Also, every time you open a PDF or an image file the preview application becomes active, I would have preferred the application to quit automatically when I close the image). In summary, it is easier and cooler in Windows 7 to view images.Software Installation - There is no control panel in OS X. Just drag the file into the trash bin and it is gone. It has traces in your system but essentially it is gone for all practical purposes. I like this easy deletion aspect in OS X.VPN Connection - Certain (or many?) VPN connection softwares like Juniper cannot be installed on OS X because some of these VPN connections connect using some plugins that are designed specifically for Internet Explorer, which is not available on OS X. I wanted to connect to work using the Microsoft Office remote desktop client but could not do it due to this restriction .External Applications - All the applications cannot be installed in OS X. There are lots of companies out there that make products just for Windows machines. I had to install StatTools for my course work and the tool could not be installed on OS X, so I had to work from another Windows machine at work on the weekends for my course work. I could have also installed Bootcamp and that comes up next.Bootcamp - I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on MBP. I observed that Windows 7 is slow and the hard disk makes squeaky noises when you are trying to open an application in bootcamp, also the track pad experience is not the same despite the various drivers and the keyboard layout is obviously different. You can overcome these problems by connecting the MBP to a HDTV or any monitor and then using a wireless Windows keyboard + mouse but then the whole setup is too much hassle and defeats the purpose of a laptop.Wakeup time - The MBP is pretty fast on this aspectOS X Lion - I am still on Snow Leopard and do not see any reason to upgrade to Lion. In fact I observe that a lot of people want to downgrade to Snow Leopard from Lion due to stability issues. The fixes are on their way but do check for performance before the upgrade.**HARDWARETrack pad - This is something you would love to use and a big selling point, you can never think of going back to other laptops after using this. I always used a mouse on the Windows laptops but never even felt the need for a mouse on the MBP. The two finger swipe to scroll and three finger swipe that replace the 'Home' and 'End' buttons, pinch and zoom for PDF document and images are pretty cool options. I was pretty amazed at the track pad when I started learning more about the OS X.Keyboard - Keys are located spaciously. My previous two laptops frequently had dirt stuck in between the keys which used to drive me crazy.Heat - HP and Compaq laptops generate so much heat that you can use them as a personal heater (I used to do it). The whirring sound made by my Compaq laptop's heat fan used to be pretty embarrassing for me in my class or in the meetings, I hated opening the laptop. In a contrast, the MBP is very calm, the fan does go up occasionally when you run some intensive applications such as office (along with some other intensive applications) or play graphic video games but you will hardly notice it.Build - Unibody aluminum build with just 10 screws at the back is something you would appreciate only when you have used other laptops made of plastic material that make creaky sounds every time you lift them. The upper lid of these other plastic material laptops tend to wobble a lot over time but the MBP's lid is pretty stiff even after 7 months of daily use (at least 3 hours a day).Screen - I personally like the fact there is no slight gap between the glossy screen and border of the lid. In other laptops dust gets stuck between the screen and the plastic and it could be really irritating when you cannot remove the dust. Screen quality, there are different manufacturers for the LCD screen, please search for 9CC3, 9CC5 and 9CC7 to know more about this. I have a 9CC3 (luckily) and it is supposed to be the best one available for a 13\" MBP.Ports - HDMI port is not available directly but you can buy a 10 feet long HDMI output cable for less than $20.DVD Drive - Other laptops tend to have DVD drive as an attachment but in a MBP it is inseparable (at least by the looks of it). The DVD drives on the two other laptops I owned before MBP used to make a quirky sound when I used to wake them up from sleep or do a restart, no such sounds on the MBP.Battery - The longest battery life out I could extract from MBP was about 6 hours with browsing. That is pretty good considering that other cheaper laptops can only last for 2.5 hours. Of course you can upgrade your battery on the other laptops but you need to compromise on the weight.Power Chord and Charger - One of my friends accidentally tripped over a $1000 Sony Vaio's  power chord and the machine fell on the floor with brute force. I still remember how anxious he was till the machine powered up. This would not happen with a MBP, the chord attaches to the MBP with magnet, in case of an accident the power chord would detach itself and nothing would still happen to the MBP. The adapter is light weight and you can carry it in a backpack (no big bundles like the ones you see for HP and Dell).Function Keys - I use the function keys in Windows 7 machines to close application, essentially which means that I am going to just use F4 for pressing Ctrl+F4 or Alt+F4. I like the Apple's way of function keys, pretty easy to use and only contains what we exactly need. Ctrl+F4 and Alt+F4 are replaced by CMD+W in OS X.Webcam - 720p & perfect for Skype.Backlit Keyboard - If you have not used one before you will love this option.Resale Value - Based on the eBay listings I can say that you could expect to recover 75% of the actual value of a MBP if you maintain it well (if sold within a year of purchase).Apple Warranty - International warranty for 1 year + easy replacement within 3 months + Apple protection for 3 years for $200 (warranty is international again) is really worth it. I felt that my battery was losing its power quickly and Apple Store promptly replaced the battery for me.Cons (the only one)Speakers Sound - Sound is kind of low for me, I really wish that it was louder.So to summarize I am impressed with the hardware by every bit and I really do not have any complaints about the hardware design.******************************************************************************In conclusion, if you are going to use your laptop for Microsoft Office and want to connect to Windows machine through Remote Desktop or VPN, I would recommend not to jump the boat to OS X and instead consider other alternatives listed below. The experience of Microsoft Office, switching between applications and productivity is much better on Windows 7. I am going to still try to adapt to Office 2011 in OS X and if that does not work out I would consider the other Ultrabooks.I would still recommend a MBP if you want to buy a laptop for casual browsing and simple applications at home, the hardware design is pretty awesome.Alternatives to consider - Similar hardware design with Windows 7 would be a very good combination and that brings me to Windows Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks are about the same price (or in most of the cases cheaper than MBP), faster with a SSD and are very appealing with Windows 8 soon on the cards. I read on tech websites that HP Envy Spectre 14, Lenovo U300S, Asus Zenbook, HP Folio 13, Dell XPS and Samsung Series 9 are pretty well built like a MBP but run on Windows 7. Currently, HP Envy Spectre 14 has got the best reviews of all the ultrabooks as of now and Asus is about to release their second iteration of zenbooks soon, so thats some good news if you are a Windows fan.", "Date": "February 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Review from a long time windows user - Excellent Notebook", "Author": "SamTheTechy", "ReviewID": "RX19W7RDAT5PW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I am a systems engineer doing systems development for the past 15 years or more.

There is no unnecessary software that came with this Mac and no need to uninstall anything. No virus issues as well. Everything simply works. No crashes or freezes so far.I am an avid Google chrome user but when I saw how fast the Safari browser is, I didn't even think of installing Chrome on this.When the screen backlight is set to 50%, battery lasts for about 7.5 hrs with light usage.

I am an art major and I needed something that runs reliably with some of the heavy software that I would be using. I had used a iMac at school to finish up a a project with Photoshop (this was a public computer) and it worked amazingly. The first thing I noticed was the fact that there is only one clicking button, not the left and right click that you would see on a PC. The stability of the OS X 10.7.2 is amazing. I have never used such a quick computer before. The computer comes beautifully packaged and the shape of the laptop is just remarkable. I don't know how they were able to fit such a fine mechanism into such a drastically aesthetic design. It's like Apple thought carefully about ease of use, neutrality in color, while also being fully aware of the software. The finger swipes are addictive. You CANNOT do anyhing like this on a PC that I know of. The trackpad is revolutionary in my mind. It is just one solid gray square made of glass. It feels your fingers swipes and seemlessly manages to switch from window to window, screen to screen. The camera is high quality. There is no random, no-name software in here either. This is one of the main things that really almost brought be to tears. I didn't have to uninstall all the useless junkware. The computer turns on, welcomes you, and prompts a few start up questions. Then you have the desktop. I don't, in any way feel pretentious about having this computer. This IS a very expensive computer, but I know that it is a high quality computer, well worth the price.

It works really well. The pricing is very competitive. You will fall in love with it in no time. If you could stretch by a few 100 dollars I highly recommend you should replace your Windows laptop with this one.My review mainly talks about the difference I have felt between an early 2011 and late 2011 mac book pro.I bought mine from Apple Store the day it was released as Amazon didn't have it yet.Processor - When compared to my 3 week old Early 2011 edition there I barely experience any difference in performance (2.3 GHz v/s 2.4 GHz).Hard disk - The new editions gives you more hard disk space (500GB instead of 320GB) but time has taught me never to trust an internal hard disk. I always use a backup hard disk to store important files at all times. So, the hard disk capacity really doesn't matter to me.Issues I have encountered so far on the Late 2011 Edition (new one):Fan noise: The fan made a constant hissing noise in the background. So, I took it back to the apple store and they  narcissist genius bar staff) fixed it by resetting the fan at boot up.(Beware, their staff could send you back making you feel that only they know what a computer is. I had the staff telling me older version did not make the fan noise cause it is a \"different\" computer. Yeah, of course smarty pants \"fix it now\")Software - Compared to the early 2011 edition I did see inbuilt applications crashing and it prompted me to send the report to Apple (which I promptly did).I think this will happen to any new version of computer/phone released and I need to wait for the next set of updates to have all of this fixed. I will be patient for few months.Overall,at this point I feel for 100 bucks more you will get a newer hardware but it is not drastically different and you will not miss anything if you want to save some money and want to stick with the Early 2011 edition.Enjoy your mac book pro !!", "Date": "October 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Apple vs PC", "Author": "Ammo13", "ReviewID": "RBBLVM3BLZYUN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer for my wife about a year ago.  From the moment we turned it on we noticed the true difference between a PC and a MAC.  PC's are truly built for the Techy and MAC's for the rest of us.  That is not to say that MAC's are only for people that have no idea how to use a PC, they are built for those that don't know how all the code works.  Currently, we have two PC's and one MAC.  The Mac cost quite a bit more than the PC, however, we haven't had any software or hardware problems with the MAC and a host of software problems with the PC.  Furthermore, the touch pad on a MAC is superior to that on a PC.  There is no struggle to scroll down, right click, drag and drop and so on.  Also, when I purchased the MAC, it came with a free wireless printer.  The PC desktop wouldn't load the printer through the Windows auto feature because it couldn't find a suitable driver.  I had to use the disk that came with the Printer.  Not a problem, but when I started loading the software on the PC I figured I would see how it worked on a MAC.  The MAC asked me two easy questions, asked for permission to go to the HP website for the software and printed it's first test page before the PC loaded three of nine items from the disk.Overall, the MAC is superior in everything so far over the PC, but most importantly is the Operating system.  MAC's operating system seems flawless.  Quick start up and blazing speeds to include shut down or waking the system up.  Plus Apple thinks of little details, like a keyboard that knows it's dark so it lights up and then allows you to set the brightness.  You will pay more, but I think money is less important than time and the extra bucks are worth the savings in patience you will need with a PC and Windows.  However, if you are truly looking for that ability to figure out code and love to wait for Windows to consistently update and crash, save some cash and buy a PC.  You can tuck away the savings you will eventually need for relaxation therapy sessions after purchasing a PC.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Zurez \"ZAMZUREZ\"", "ReviewID": "RTL4SIRAVJLQ1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Laptop is just amazing!

Start ups are faster, the shortcuts are amazing, the customization (and ease of customization) is amazing.

Pages documents would translate to Word and sometimes do funky things with my formatting.All in all I give this machine a 10 out of 10.

I am definitely not tech savvy but can pick up things fairly quickly despite my advancing years, however I have to say that initially I had my reservations and seriously felt I had made a mistake. I stuck with it however and have gradually come to enjoy the machine.The most outstanding feature in my mind is the Trackpad that everyone pretty much swoons about. It is amazing. When one gets used to the gestures and ability to click anywhere on the pad with either one finger or two, it just comes to life. Having more money, or rather, more credit, than sense, I married the Mac to both the Apple BT keyboard and trackpad, which makes my office setup both ergonomic and fun.I am still plodding away learning Lion OS which is a departure from Windows 7 and I have to say I do not find it that intuitive, however it is slowly making more sense to me.I decided to upgrade my RAM which, according to Crucial Memory, the Pro will in fact support 16GB as opposed to the 8GB proclaimed by Apple and look forward to installing it today and seeing whether it speeds up my machine. I have to say I am not a heavy multi-tasker with computers or life in general, but it will be interesting to see any changes.Another small frustration in getting to know the mac, and an indicator to my poor pre purchase research, is that some software designed for the mac is different that it's Windows counterparts. Not a huge thing however I enjoyed some aspects of Quicken for Windows not available on the mac version. Hence the wallet opened again and after installing Parallels for Mac and a new copy of Windows 7, I now have the ability to run Windows products seamlessly with my Mac OS all the while continuing to delight in the benefits of the touchpad on the Mac giving me the best of both worlds.All in all I am very happy with the machine and do not regret the purchase. Speed wise it seems good enough for all that I need as I am not a gamer, huge multi-tasker or graphic heavy user. The experience does continue and whereas I was very happy with Windows 7 and Microsoft in general, I am starting to lean more towards Apple. Only time will tell.......Small addendum:Upon upgrading the RAM two things came to light as suggestions. Firstly, invest in a correctly sized mini \"phillips style\" screwdriver with a good sized handle. The 10 or so screws are fairly securely fastened requiring a moderate amount of torque to get them going. A slightly larger than optimum screw head could easily strip the screw making removal of the back plate a major bug bear.Secondly, if you are, like me, upgrading to different capacity memory sticks, put the larger of the banks in the bottom memory bay. I initially installed my new 8GB module in the top bay, leaving the original 2GB module in the bottom bay. Unfortunately the Mac did not recognize the new module and maintained the original 2GB, 2GB configuration. After a brief review of the Crucial website, I found the suggestion to try and reverse the order of the modules which I did resulting in the Mac recognizing all 10GB when \"About this Mac\" was consulted.", "Date": "January 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Yes, a Thousand Times, YES!", "Author": "Julia Norton", "ReviewID": "R2OJW1BWPBA6PM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally hesitated when buying this product.  I am a traveler and I only spend one year in each country before traveling onto the next adventure.  Having something considered \"elitist\" and very expensive on travels made me a bit nervous of pick pocketing.  Not only that, but it's hard to synch a Mac with other computers and there's no real tech support yet where I'm going next.  So, I ended up buying a different brand of laptop (to remain unnamed) and HATED it.  In it's defense, I think it was a defective model, but still!  So awful and the internet was so slow.  It was pricey too.  Not as pricey as this, but pretty up there.And then I got this... this demigod.Travelers out there, let me tell you, this is the ultimate laptop.  It's skinny, fits well in my backpack, it's lightweight, has a decent battery life (not the best, but certainly decent enough - around 5 hours).  I have the 13\".

It connects better to the internet; faster connection to wifi and less crashes. Much faster connection to VPN networks.It takes time to get used to the finder instead of explorer (I personally prefer explorer were you can see folders easier and cut and paste files easier). Also I would have probably been able to get the top of the line PC with the same money for the cheapest Mac pro, some time it takes a longer for iphoto to work or microsoft office products to start working but once they start they are much more stable than on PC and the lag time is minimal and trivial to me.The 13\" screen is adequate for internet browsing, watching videos/photos and writing documents. It is a little small for working on excel / databases. I might consider buying a 15\" in the future if they become lighter.In summary, I'm glad I made the switch.

It took a little bit of time, but I so much more enjoy using the Mac OS X Lion than Windows. It slowly grows on you and in the first month or two you learn something new each day. One of the things I didn't expect is that I never use -- or feel the need to use -- a mouse. The multi-touch trackpad is so easy and feature packed that a mouse would be a big step backward.My recommendations to long-time Windows users is to make the switch. I purchased a copy of VMWare Fusion 4 which is a fantastic product that allows you to run \"real Windows\" on your Mac.

The MacBook didn't even break a sweat.Being a screen printer I was used to using CorelDraw for design work and was hesitant to switch to Mac since Corel isn't available in a Mac version.  No problems, I was able to set up a virtual windows machine using Parallels for Mac and can now run any windows program as well.

I'd be willing to bet that any Windows user who buys one of these laptops will NEVER voluntarily go back to using a PC ever again.Everything is incredibly simple, the screen is gorgeous, the keyboard has quiet-touch keys that light up which make typing fun.

The hardware quality alone makes it worth the price, and MAC OS X Lion adds another layer of excellence.As others have said, the attention to detail in the hardware is superb, most notably the aluminium unibody chassis, the vivid LCD screen (1280 x 800), the panel hinge and the unsurpassed trackpad. The baseline Macbook Pro represented here is a beautifully engineered embodiment of the Intel Sandy Bridge mobile platform with integrated HD 3000 graphics.I have a few minor negatives to share, but nothing that would warrant docking a star from the rating:1) You won't be getting iWeb or iDVD as part of the iLife package pre-installed with the machine. You still get iMovie and Garageband, though.2) 4GB of memory is on the edge of being too little, depending on how many applications you are apt to leave open during a working day. You may be glad that it is easy to upgrade the RAM on this machine to 8GB.3) The integrated graphics are weaker than the previously supported nVidia discrete graphics in the Core 2 Duo MacBooks. You now have to step up to the 15\" Macbooks to get a machine suitable for graphics-intensive tasks (other than video encoding and playback). But, unless you use your machine for gaming or 3-d animations you are unlikely to miss the graphics prowess of a discrete GPU.These days Windows has gained much of the stability and usability that used to be the sole province of Mac OS, so the preference for Mac OS is less compelling than it once was. Nevertheless, the use of a large, ergonomic trackpad with reliable and accurate gesture recognition *built into the OS* is a wonderful thing, and not easy to give up once you've experienced it. Windows 8 may take that distinction away as well, but so far I've not come across PC hardware good enough to make the experience as complete as it is with currently is with a late 2011 Macbook.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop I have ever had", "Author": "Cindy", "ReviewID": "R3FCDLS1NKFBWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received the laptop today and have not been able to shut it off!!

It is still trying to catch up with Windows in many ways. Windows 7 is a much better OS in my opinion.I think in the end it comes down to the fact that if you spend as much money on a Windows laptop as you do on a MacBook Pro you would never feel the need to shift to a mac and I am going to do just that.At the same time, I will re-consider buying a Mac again when OS X is well groomed and when Macbook gives value for money spent on it.

Since that time it had required TWO replacements of the track pad; a first in January, 2011, and a second in February, 2012.  In both cases I have paid for the repair (for a total of approximately $98 each time).I am very disappointed in the product as the track pad is used as much or more than any other component and it is reasonable to expect it to last more than the time it did.  I realize that use patterns may differ between people, but the fact that the computer has needed three track pads in less than three years is quite disturbing.Equally disturbing is that Apple never offered to pay for either of the repairs, which I would have expected a company to do if it was really concerned about customer service and satisfaction.  Nor have they responded to my repeated attempts to engage them in a discussion of my situation.We have a second Mac Book Pro in the family - purchased in 2008. It had to have the entire screen and back panel replaced because of a design flaw - a cable that connected an internal board to the display screen had become dislodged and pinched by the opening and closing of the computer.

I spent months researching laptops.  I wanted something full powered (core i5) in a simplistic 13\" form factor, with great battery life.  I went back and forth between some of the new 'Ultrabooks' such as the Asus Zenbook & Toshiba Portege.  They were tempting, but a big turn off to me was the limited processing power and shallow feel to the keyboard.  In the end I came down to the Lenovo U400 and this MacBook Pro.  An excellent Black Friday deal got be the U400 for around $850, so I took the plunge.  Without going into details, the end result was a return within a week and my ordering of this fine computer.What really sold me on the MacBook Pro was it's ability to thrive at being a laptop.  I personally do not feel there is a better laptop out there for the reasons in which I will list shortly.  Now I will start off by saying that I am not an Apple fan simple because they're Apple.  Now, that said, here are the reasons that sold me:1.  The simplistic, all aluminum case in a 13\" form factor.2.  The keyboard is second to none for laptops.3.  The touch pad is a dream to use.4.  The battery life is top notch for a full featured laptop.5.  It has the little extras such as back lit keyboard and SD reader built in.Notice I did not mention anything about the Mac OS.  Up until I purchased this computer, I had very little experience with the Mac OS, so I was a little hesitant.  I have a fairly technical background and knack for tinkering with my computers, so I figured how hard could it be to learn?  To my surprise, it was a little frustrating the first week or two, but after that all I can say is that it simply makes sense.  Things work in the way that they should work.  Does this create some limitations on what you can do in comparison to a more open Windows? Yes, certainly.  But at the same time, I've learned that I really don't need to do those tiny little things I was fussing over.  Some people will never be fans of Apple or their OS, and that's understandable.  But coming from an avid Windows user and someone a little more technically inclined than the average person, I can honestly say it's a pleasure to use the Mac OS.My only tiny gripe is that Apple still refuses to incorporate HDMI.  I'd love to hook my MacBook Pro up to my external monitor for those times the extra screen real estate could be used.  There are plenty of adapters out there though to make this happen still.  I just wish it didn't take an adapter or special cable.So far so good.

This is my first Apple product ever. I have to admit, up until recently I've considered myself an Anti-Apple Crusader! But in my new job, I've got a lot of exposure to Apple's products and the customers feedback has been overwhelming: People love their Apples!! You combine that with life-long series of disappointments, frustrations, freezes, crashes, viruses and 'updates' with each and every \"PC\" I have come to own or use ( and trust me when I say: I've got my hands on quite a few).It was a 'Green Monday' deal at a nearby Bestbuy store: Apple MacBook Pro 13\" for a little over $1000 with 6-18 months Financing. I just couldn't let it pass. And so I got my hands on my first Mac.Urban Myths Versus First-Hand Realities:-----------------------------------------------1) The Only True PC On The Market: We use the abbreviation PC so loosely that we kind of forgot what it stands for: \"Personal Computer.\" So it has nothing to do with a particular OS or hardware manufacturer but rather the combination of both and the overall user's experience. That's being said, and having used my Macbook for  over two months, I'm ready to make a rather bold statement: Mac computers are the only true PC's on the market. Other machines are more less of Windows-Bloated computers!!2) The Mac OS: Mine has Mac OS X v10.7 Lion pre-installed.  I have to admit I was afraid the switch was going to be hard because I knew nothing about Macs. But 3 days into using my MacBook Pro, I fell in love with it!  The Operating System is very user-friendly and ridiculously easy to use/navigate. The following link was a great reference for me: [...]. I also went on YouTube for more advise on how to get the best of my new Mac. And the Apple Rep at the nearby BestBuy store was super helpful. Honestly, by the end of the first week, I was up & running and since, never really needed to ask any questions as to how use my Mac. Oh, one more thing that is worth highlight: settings (\"System Preferences\") are very visualized & easy to set up & change. Three thumbs up! I know I'll never miss the \"Control Panel\" on other so-called PC's.3) Superior Build Quality: You get what you pay for. You're paying premium price but you're also getting a premium quality. The Aluminium unibody is an eye and a hand pleaser! The built quality is superb and attention to details is meticulous!4) Great Juice Pack! The MacBook Pro is, hands down, the best battery life laptop out there with 7 hours of rigorous use easy! I can't think of any other laptop that comes close.5) Lack of HDMI port: Simply overrated! All you need is a Mini Display to HDMI adaptor and you're set! It would be nice to have a dedicated HDMI but I don't think it's a deal breaker.6) Blue Ray Drive: Well, it would be nice to have but I don't miss it. Here's why, because I don't like spending $25 on Blue Ray Discs!!7) ClickPad: Once you learn the different gestures you can do with your fingers on the generously spaced ClickPad, you're hooked for life. It makes browsing the Internet a pleasurable experience. It really is flawless.8) WebCam: is standard VGA 1.3 MP that fell short of expectations, especially when compared to the 2.0 MP WebCam found on laptops like my previous Lenovo Edge 14\". I have to admit, the difference in video conferencing quality is noticeable. I am not saying it's bad but I surely have seen better and was hoping for more.9) I love the \"Dock.\" It really is the easiest way to access frequently used apps. When you combine it with the \"Launchpad\" then all of your apps come within reach. The whole platform is optimized for multitasking.10) The First Comprehensive Digital Ecosystem: Apple-branded devices work in a near perfect harmony with each other: iPhone, iPad, MacBook Pro, Time Capsule and Apple TV. You've got apps for your MacBook, apps for your iPhone, your iPad. You've got all kinds of accessories to personalize & maximize work and play output. It's like being a member of an exclusive club where you get Prime time every time!!Bottom Line:---------------It sure is worth every penny I have invested into buying it. I'm not saying it's perfect.

With so many devices to connect I thought that these wouldn\u2019t be sufficient for my needs, but then I compromised. I have not had any problems with the machine thus far until about 2 weeks ago.

After doing research on the internet I find out that there is a possibility that I may need the logic board replaced. I then took the machine to the istore so they could send it to the technicians. The technicians say my USB ports are damaged and since they are attached to the logic board the entire thing needs to be replaced. The cost of replacing it, close to $ 700. That\u2019s almost the price of a new MacBook Pro. To say the least I am disappointed that a machine of this calibre can have problems like this.

Plus I don't need the i7 processor.Now to the review:I have had 2 Windows laptops in the last 2 years (HP and Acer).The HP harddrive crashed on me and the Acer is just way too slow.I bought the Apple MacBook Pro MD313LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop (Fall 2011) version and I can't be happier.The first thing I noticed was how sleek it looked. It is all aluminum and felt like a well-built machine.After turning it on, it look around 15-20 seconds to boot up.The first thing you notice is how crisp all the icons and webpages looked. If you put the computer in maximum brightness, the colors are so vivid. I loaded my personal photo albums and the colors are vibrant. There is hardly any pixelation you get in other pc monitors.The keyboard is a chiclet type which feels so natural when typing. The trackpad is another great innovative part of this computer. You can customize the different gestures on the mousepad to make navigating a more enjoyable experience.The best thing about this product is probably the battery life. I got about 7-8 hours of use with average brightness. I never had this kind of battery life with other PC laptops. I had an ASUS netbook a year ago which gave me about 6-7 hours, but you get a slower processor speed and smaller screen. If you have copy of Windows 7, you can use this laptop to boot it and the interface looks so much better on this machine. You can use products like Pararell 7 or VM Fusion to toggle back and forth from Mac to Windows without ever restarting the computer.Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this product. The Lion OSX makes this computer a fun device to use. The speed is blazing fast. I never experienced any lag or slowness when opening multiple applications or programs.

I didn't need another new one. I had just spent two weeks installing xcode because instead of letting you download this free programing workbench from a web page, apple forces you to buy it via apple store for free. I never had an itune account and for that reason, I couldn't simply set up my account on the newly purchased MacBook. I was on the phone with the apple genius and her supervisor for hours to no avail. they told me to use my windows laptop to first open an itune account but that didn't work either. they told me to wait for an email or phone the following day. nobody called or emailed and my account still didn't work the following day. then I called them and a few hours later it was working. apple geniuses are polite and often apologize. as a result, you can't really lash out at them. but there're useless. eventually, I didn't bring the laptop to the apple store because I didn't want another laptop, which would require me download xcode again.

My last computer was a Compaq Presario that I bought in '07, and after a little over four years, its on it last legs.  I bought it with Vista installed on it and was sick and tired of the irritating crashes, screen freezes, time intensive updates, etc.  Additionally, it reached the point a couple of months ago where, I started getting messages saying an application failed, and shortly after that, the screen would flicker, and the entire taskbar along the bottom of the screen would just disappear.  About 15-20 minutes later, it would flicker and reappear.  If I was downloading anything when it flickered, I would lose it and have to start all over while dealing with the screen continously freezing.  So yesterday I went to the Apple store and bought a Macbook Pro and the only thing I have to say after having had it for 24 hours, is what took me so long?  Its a breeze to setup, not to mention it boots up in like 10 seconds and is ready to go.  No more waiting two or three minutes for my computer to boot up, followed by another minute or so for my home screen to populate itself and finally be ready for use.  I really like the Facetime camera and all of the effects you can create in it using iPhoto.  I'm still getting acclimated to Mac OS X Lion but thats not a problem.  To anyone considering making switch, I say go for it...you won't regret it.UPDATE:  3/1/11 Just attempted to create my first DVD using iMovie and I had planned to use iDVD but found that newer model MAcbook Pros are no longer being shipped with iDVD as a part of the iLife suite.

Nield", "ReviewID": "R3M99ZWISX968T", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been working on an iPad app for five months on this Macbook Pro. I will come forth and admit I've traditionally been a PC person and I appreciate the flexible environments it offers for businesses, programmers, and developers as well as providing tools to create complex business-geared applications. Mac OS X, as pleasant as it is to use, has such a controlled experience to the point it dampens technical creativity. I can't help but compare the MacBook to a game console like the Xbox or PS3. It restricts your activities to just consuming media rather than creating anything with the exception of movies, music, and visual publications. Granted Microsoft Office did get re-released for Mac OS X, it still condones an environment of massive media consumption and consumer amusement rather than productivity. I understand that was the intent though. Apple wanted to create an experience that they defined and controlled to keep the user experience streamlined. But Apple is out to solve people's personal problems and create consumer amusement, not solve the technical problems of the world businesses faces every day. It's a cruel irony that Apple claims to unleash people's creativity but then turns around and dictates everything the user cannot do. I am not allowed to make an app without a $100 fee and an approval process conducted by them, and I certainly cannot explore the technical beauty of Apple technology that they have so securely locked down.The tools to create programs on Mac OS X and iOS were a major disappointment to me. I really wanted Apple XCode to be pleasant to use so I could pursue making mobile apps on my own time, but it was like programming in the 1990's. Everything about Objective-C is so archaic and dated, and Apple knows this as it scrambles producing massive updates that completely overhaul the coding patterns every three months. If you buy a book on Apple programming, you can expect to have a nice paperweight within three months. The debugging tools are a nightmare and unless you are a hardcore C programmer do not expect this to be some nice, shiny Visual Studio-esque IDE. Although each massive update to Xcode adds new features that improves the coding experience (like ARC garbage collection, praise Jesus!), the obsolescence of prior coding paradigms creates massive headaches for programmers.  Apple is so far behind when it comes to serving developers' needs because every app and line of code was done in-house by Apple until recently. They had to open up iOS a little and let non-Apple employees make apps.In summary, Apple makes consumer products and consumer solutions, not enterprise or developer. Do not buy a Macbook expecting it will help you be productive especially in enterprise or business settings.

The final straw was the constant popups using the family filter.  The filter doesn't allow secure https websites, and it seemed that every website you visited it was trying to connect to 3 or 4 of them.  Even going to a website like Sports Illustrated, it would popup that it didn't allow about three secure websites, like facebook.com, and some random ones that I've never heard of before.  But you could go straight to the website, albeit the unsecure one, so I don't know what the point was.  I started just logging in and accepting all the websites that the filter was warning me about, but it never stopped.  If you google this problem, this has been an issue for many years with Apple users.  I just expect more from a computer if I'm going to pay that much for it.  The good news is that I've grown to love our iPad, which allows me to quickly access the Internet, which is what I mainly use a laptop for, anyway.VERDICT:  Macs can be considered the Lexus of computers.  You pay more, and you expect more.  But just like a Lexus might give you problems, and there may be things about the car you don't care for, the same things go for Macs.  Do you drive a Lexus in real life, or is a Toyota good enough?  Even if the Toyota uses the same engine and chassis?  I drive a Toyota, but decided to splurge on this MacBook.  I'm glad I got it, at the least to see what the fuss is about.  This is my first Apple since my 1985 Apple IIc, and it's a very nice product.  But I'm not convinced to buy a Mac for my next computer.There is basically a rivalry between Apple aficionados and people who don't understand what makes Macs so great.  The success of iPhones have made Apple people even more intolerable (and increased their numbers).  What a lot of people don't realize is that Office is the top selling software for Macs in the world.  So they basically buy an Apple to run Microsoft products.  And if Windows was the piece of crap that Apple people say it is, then it would have gone the way of the Yugo by now, rather than being on 95% of personal computers.  Granted, a huge reason that Windows is so popular is that it runs on computers that don't have a huge markup on their hardware.  Don't be mistaken that the hardware is blessed by Apple; they use the same vendors.  A Dell Inspiron 14R laptop has a 14\" monitor, Intel i5 2.5GHz processor, 6GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM, and a 750GB hard drive for $640.00.  This MacBook Pro has a 13.3\" monitor, Intel i5 2.4GHz processor, 4GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM, and a 500 GB hard drive for $1,200.00.  Both have USB ports, DVD drives, etc.  So you're practically paying twice as much for something that isn't quite as nice, as far as hardware goes.  Yes, Windows is put on some crappy computers (I'm looking at you, HP/Compaq), but you can't use the crappiest Windows computers as an example of Mac's superiority.  There are a few other hardware differences, like the Thunderbolt port, which is basically a fancy name for their HDMI port.  And they have magnets to hold the lid shut and attach the power cord, which are so minor they are hardly worth mentioning.As far as Mac OS X vs. Windows 7, let me be the first to say that Windows 7 is a huge disappointment, although better than Vista was.  I wish we could still get Windows XP.  It's almost like Windows is trying to get too cute, a.k.a. more like a Mac.  And Mac does some things much easier than Windows, such as the Family Filter.  It's already on the Mac, and super easy to set up on profiles.  With Windows, you have to download it, install it, then sign up for their crap, blah, blah, blah.  But there are some things I really miss from Windows, like a right click button (you can hold down one of the keyboard buttons on the Mac to get the menus, however).  And I like having my open programs on the taskbar in Windows, instead of that icon bar on Macs, where it's not clear what programs are open.  There are some other minor learning curves, like the close window button is on the left instead of the right, and the infamous Ctrl+Alt+Del combo is some other keys, which I forgot.  You get to scroll and zoom using two fingers, which are neat tricks.  But I wish there was a way to lock the computer (like you can with Windows) so updates could continue to be downloaded while you're away from the computer.  If you log off, sleep, or shut down the computer, the downloads stop.  You have to wait until the screen saver kicks in to keep the downloads going and not worry about someone getting on your profile.As far as software goes, that big problem has basically gone away.  Microsoft Office on the Mac can open files made from Windows, and vice versa.  All the major programs are available for Mac, like Firefox, Google Chrome, Quicken, Openoffice, etc.  And the Mac comes with some great programs to edit video and pictures.  A program would have to be pretty remote to require only Windows.  And if that's the case, then you can even buy Windows ($100) and install it on your Mac, so you wouldn't need a separate computer.Basically, the reason I bought it is because my wife and kids are in love with their iPod Touches and iPads.  But I don't believe Apple products have halos over them.  I personally can't stand iTunes.  Amazon is WAY better; they don't require a download, it's easier to group your songs, and you don't have to worry about trying to convert the files to MP3s so they can play on non-Apple products.  I think the iPod Nano is not user-friendly with its scroll wheel.  I prefer Chrome and Firefox over Safari.  (IE? Yuck.)  And replacing your battery yourself voids your warranty?  Not everyone lives next door to an Apple Store to get the battery replaced.I think that if Apple sold their Macs more in line with what they are worth, their market share would increase tenfold, but it looks like they prefer for Google to try to come up with something to threaten Microsoft's market stranglehold.  For now, I believe the reason people buy Macs is the same reason that people buy Lexuses.  They think their product is so much better to warrant the price tag.  I plan to enjoy this MacBook, just like I plan to continue to enjoy my Windows desktop.  But I'm not sure about the hype that they are worth twice as much as a Windows computer from a reputable manufacturer.

They also overcharge you for every adapter ($28 for an external display that doesn't even fit properly). My real complaint, however, is the design. There are only two USB ports on the laptop and although you can add external hubs, you will reach a point where the laptop fails to read them all at once (keep in mind if you own an iphone, you will be down to just one). The head scratching element to this is that they are side by side! Half of the usb plugs won't fit without blocking the other plug or using a hub to begin with.
