It is a very nice laptop, with one or two caveats.Fit and finish is good. There is no \"cheap plastic\" feel, it's solid, and for the sheer size of the thing, it is surprisingly thin and light.The screen is lovely, no dead pixels, good viewing angles, but could be brighter. Webcam is average, with specs above it's capabilities - it produces muddy, laggy images at max resolution.Speakers are ok, volume is somewhat limited, but better than most laptops. The subwoofer doesnt really woof, but it's better than nothing. The 5.1 surround effect works, but it needs Dolby enhancement enabled in the driver. Without it, it just sounds horrible.1.73GHz CPU is plenty powerful for everything I use it for, the cooling system seems to work well with the laptop remaining relatively cool, but the exhaust air is very warm.The 500gb HDD is slow and with 750gb drives having been available for months, I would expect a bigger one included with a machine in this price range. The claimed 2nd HDD support is, as others have noted, just not workable out the box. You can fit a drive, but the cover wont fit, and I can't source a replacement. Amazon saw fit to refund me a generous amount for this issue, so well done them!Graphics wise, the 5850 with 2Gb GDDR3 is a slight disappointment. Once again, for a machine in this price range, GDDR5 would be more appropriate. However, it does work well enough, and can drive the screen at full resolution and maxed-out settings in LotRo and deliver a useable 30fps minimum.The bluray drive works ok, the included Acer Arcade application is a horrific pain to use, but until bluray support comes to Media Player it will have to do.The light-up trackpad is a nice feature, but there is no easy way of configuring the music and media buttons to user preferences - it fires up Acer Arcade by default when installed, otherwise Media Player. The programmable hinge buttons are useful, if in a slightly awkward position. The chiclet keyboard works well enough, I am unsure if it's plastic or real metal, but it does the job.This model did not come with a TV tuner installed, but the IR port functions perfectly. Wireless and wired networking both work flawlessly, I have had no dropouts as some others have experienced.Battery life is surprisingly good for a machine this size, I get a reliable 2.5 unplugged hours for watching DVD's.It may sound like I am finding fault with this machine, but thats not the case. I really, really like it, just pointing out the niggles I have. Overall it's great, and I'd reccommend it :)", "Date": "February 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Fast, and with no problems whatsoever", "Author": "Phos", "ReviewID": "RLECPK7UX9W2D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Acer AS8943G-9429 18.4-Inch Laptop (Aluminum)I bought this Acer as a desktop replacement after reading other reviews here and on the web. This laptop is huge but quite light for its size. It is fast, its fan is quiet, and it does not get warm after using it for 15+ hours. The keyboard and its squarish button design was a point of contention for me in the beginning. By using it I understood that it responds much faster to my keystrokes than the usual external keyboard, so I don't need to bang the keys anymore. The screen is large enough to have two documents open or to review images without scrolling. All my software, 3D, spreadsheets, stats, drawing, word processors, either in native 64 bit or in 32 bit, work well and with no problems whatsoever. I credit Windows 7 that seems so stable I don't want to jinx it! I still have not used the fingerprint utility, somehow it requires more patience than what I got in actually making the same speed exactly when you are passing your fingers from the sensor. The camera is very responsive even to dim light, the software that comes with it is easy to use. It comes with some extras like NYTimes readers, the usual stuff put in new computers, which I uninstalled since I do not have any use for them.I don't use this computer for gaming, so I cannot comment on how fast it draws demanding game graphics. However, I am using 3D rendering software, like Solid Works and also ArcGIS and it deals with 3D representations very fast and without stalling. The Adobe Suite opens at no time, same with Office 2010.Two things would have made it absolutely perfect, but in now way affect my opinion (and satisfaction) for this laptop:1. A screen that is not gloss. When you are in a room full of light and reflecting surfaces, as I am, your eyes will be somewhat straining. Curtains curtailed the issue.2. The battery, I wished, it had 4-5 hours before recharging. As of now, it lasts me 3-3.5 hours tops with conservative use.All in all I give it a 5 out of 5. Because it is a sleek, fast, quiet and efficient machine. NO regrets buying it.", "Date": "February 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome machine", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R1ZQIMRAV4WK9R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for about 3 weeks now.

Instead of returning the merchandise to Amazon, I decided to go the manufacture warranty route.  So I called Acer the same day I received the package.  They had me go to Fedex.  Acer paid for shipping, but I did have to pay Fedex to package the laptop which is $20.  I specified the functions/features that were not working (Mostly the touchpad/volume control).  Bios installed was terrible (Couldn't even set boot sequence.)  10 days later I received my laptop back.  They did update my software/apps on the laptop, but I decided to reinstall the OS myself and do all the updating as well.  Looks like they updated the bios and now I have full control and can customize it.  They replaced the entire touchpad module.  Now the dual feature touchpad and volume control seems to be working correctly.  I was installing 4 to 5 different items simultaneously, while downloading, playing  music, surfing.  This new i7 did not even stress a little.  I need to find a benchmark app to really test it I guess.  You can do so many things at once especially with 8Gigs of ram.  As you can tell I am a happy customer.Pros - All the specs (Except hard drive.) Great Acer customer service.  In the past, I've read they were not that good.  However, I spoke to 3 different representatives and they were all very helpful and efficient.  I kept calling to make sure they took note on what were the discrepancies and also status on the repair and of course the 1st call was the initial warranty process thing.Cons - Hard drive.  This is the bottleneck.  However, after I upgrade it with a solid state drive (Once they're on sale..)  The value of this laptop should increase..=)  With the hardware in place, it will be a while I hope before I would need to upgrade this computer.  Also hoping that the hardware will last.I still own a Gateway and they are great laptops cause mine is still running flawlessly.  It is kind of ironic how Acer took over Gateway.  So in a way I bought a new Gateway just with the Acer name now.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Acer 8943G-9429 - great computer", "Author": "DanC", "ReviewID": "RL7NXDHI4ZSK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Intel core I7-740QmATI Mobility Radeon HD 5850 - 2gb18.4\" Full HD 1080p8gb DDR3 memory500gb hddThe Acer 8943G-9429 is a great computer if you don't take into account the sound.... I previously had an ASUS G73JW-A1 that was returned for vibration and noise issues.... Both have same configuration but for some reason the Asus had those vibrations (probably from the 2x500gb - 7500rpm hdds). As I am not a gamer, that vibration was very annoying....Let's talk about the Acer now: I would start with what is the most annoying issue: Sound. It is ok, but if you want quality, you need external speakers.Ok, now this computer is very fast and responsive. I am transitioning from XP to W7 and it is a great change. The keyboard is ok. It works great. It is easy to type. The computer looks very nice overall. The screen (18.4\") is great. The 1920x1080p resolution looks great on this size comparing to Asus 17.3\". You can switch it to 1600x900 but the quality is not the same but it works well. It is very quiet. I didn't try it on games, yet. The touchpad is ok, too. You need to get used with it. One little annoying issue is with DVD player. The eject button seems to not respond properly...The battery life seems to be around 3hr 45 min web surf and text editing jobs.... There were reviews with wireless adapter issues. No issues with the wireless network adapter on this model.Overall, a good desktop replacement.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Instability Issues?", "Author": "onetimehack", "ReviewID": "R24VR6TZHLLQQO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Acer Aspire 8943G-9429 for a little over two weeks now.  I love the screen, the full keyboard, pretty much everything about the laptop replacement for the desktop.  The only thing I am completely miffed about is the constant instability.  I will run mozilla firefox and it keeps giving me the blue screen of death and reboooting.Also, when I am running a blu ray disk, it will give me the blue screen of death too.  Anyone experiencing this issue?I am thinking this is related to the quad core incompatibility with mozilla.  Anyone experience differently?I am also getting a lot of instability and constant blu screen of death with other programs as well.  Again, I think this is related to the quad core issues with the drivers of Windows 7.  I have NEVER had so much issues with Windows XP.
