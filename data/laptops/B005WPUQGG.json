We did a lot of research prior to stumbling upon this laptop. Were looking for a budget PC for around $500 that had plenty of memory, windows 7, fast processor, and ability to use as work/home on the go computer. Out of the box it does come loaded with a lot of Toshiba non-sense but a free downloaded start-up mechanic helped us remove all the stuff that we didn't want and now it starts even faster. Takes about 40 seconds to start fully up and connect to our wireless. Out of the box it took about a minute with all the Toshiba stuff, but now is much faster and the intel processer makes it feel like you could have 20 things going at once with no speed delays! It's about 5 pounds and it feels like a mini-laptop when toting it around, but is much faster and screen resolution is really great compared to our 2 year-old 17 inch laptop!It took about an hour to update all the windows software that was out of date, but with the processor and memory space, it would have probably taken double to triple that on a different machine.All in all, this is a pretty good budget friendly laptop that is very mobile and actually performs very well when tasked with having an Excel spreadsheet and word document open, 3 internet explorer windows and photo-shop photo editing all at the same time. I think the price of around $500 is a very reasonable deal and although it takes a bit of getting used to the smaller keyboard/screen compared to my old 17-inch - it's been well worth it thus far! Would recommend this machine to anyone who needs a basic laptop to take to work and use as a personal machine at home.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for school", "Author": "N.

So it was worth a try with good application performance and adequate screen and keyboard. Downsides for me are that it is much heavier and gets about half the battery life as the Portege R835 we purchased last spring. I would have kept the L735 because of the great price but the breaking point came during a \"recommended\" bios update from Toshiba which led to a \"verify error\" and a dead machine. I've seen reports of this happening to other Satellite owners so I no longer trust the L735 and am replacing it with another Portege. If you get a Satellite, I'd recommend not doing a flash bios update yourself and if the machine is working ok, just leave it alone.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Merry Christmas to Me!", "Author": "C.

This is my 2nd Toshiba laptop. That one is a Qosmio that is 5 years old that the family is now using. I wanted something smaller and lighter to carry back and forth to work. This is ideal! Also, since my hands are small the keyboard is the perfect size. It doesn't have Bluetooth, which I can live without, but it has every thing else I was looking for and the case is beautiful.Merry Christmas to me!!!", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beware of product and tech support!", "Author": "TechJunkie \"EricT\"", "ReviewID": "R2JIXEMY1E7EF7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "All I can say is Wow, what a horrible experience I had with this Toshiba Laptop! I bought this item using an Gold Deal for a fair price. I was looking for a small laptop for basic items and easy portability. This seemed to fit the need with an i5 processor and decent memory and hard drive space. At first everything seemed to work fine then about a week later I started to have trouble with charging the battery. It would not charge while plugged in and drain the battery when the AC adapter was plugged in. I called Toshiba and they told me it was an AC power adapter and they would send me one but would have to charge me for it! I was shocked, this laptop was only a couple weeks old and they would charge me 91 dollars for an AC adapter. After getting the new AC adapter, the unit still had the same problem but now it would not hold a charge in the battery for more than a day when shut off. I contacted them again and they said they would not replace the unit but if I sent it in to their repair facility they would attempt a repair and send it back! This could have taken 6-8 weeks to accomplish!!! At this time I was completely frustrated and boxed the unit back up and returned it to Amazon. The only good thing I can say about this whole mess is Amazon was quick and prompt with the return process and made the transaction virtually painless! If only Toshiba had this level of service maybe I would still have the machine and be using it today!", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast, quick, good for a first laptop!", "Author": "Aneta", "ReviewID": "R21KDDHCI0KRPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had many laptop in the past, but this has been by far the best one I have ever bought. The features it comes with are amazing. The only thing I don't like about it are the speakers. The quality of them isn't that great. But you get use to them. I always end up plugging in my bigger speakers cause these ones sometimes just can't do the job. Overall, its fast, small, compact, has a good webcam and a good microphone. I'd recommend this to an student entering college who is in need of a good laptop. I personally love the sleep and charge feature. Saves me a lot of time.

The power cord inserts into plastic housing that breaks if you are unlucky enough to apply any force to the power jack. The gray dot design is very attractive, but a little prone to scratches. Also, I managed to crack the space in front of the headphone jack by picking it up by the corner.When I first received my new Toshiba, I updated the BIOS as recommended. That bricked my 5 day old laptop, so I returned it to Amazon (thanks for good service, Amazon!). Toshiba was not very helpful, but my problem was solved.

Toshiba seems to be putting out quality laptops at present. I have been very disappointed with Dells over the last 5 years or so, I think Dell quality has hit rock bottom. They were pretty good when they came out, now they are trying to capitalize on name brand.  Just read the reviews and you can get a clear picture.  Those who buy Sony all say something like \"OMG dude! Pink laptop, how coolzors is dat!\"  Reviews for Toshibas are all about best performance against various objective benchmarks and intelligent technical discussion of what is under the hood.I've had this for about 2 months now with no problems. It performs very well right out of the box. Removing some bloatware was very easy (I'm not sure if it made much difference as I did it right away). The keyboard is very good for a laptop of this size. I have no idea what customer service is like as I have had no reason to find out yet. It is light enough to take anywhere, yet powerful enough to crank out 10k iterations of an MCMC chain faster than your grandma can knit one row. It seems pretty sturdy (yes, klutz that I am, I've already dropped it, flushed it down the toilet, set it on fire, backed my car over it ... well ok, maybe nothing so bad, but it has had some relatively rough treatment).Reliability and performance are what matters for me, looking cool is irrelevant but it actually does that too.

Overall, I would say I am satisfied. As a writer, though, I find two features annoying. First, it comes with Microsoft Word Starter which suits me fine. However, there is a constant ad to buy the complete package that you are unable to close, which means that a third of the screen space is taken up by a constant ad. And the ad moves, so it catches your eye every few seconds--distracting. Second, the computer updated and rebooted without warning in the middle of my work time. Auto save did not work, and I lost an entire page of writing. If you plan to buy the full Microsoft package or don't mind a constant ad, then you will love this computer. Word of warning, though: save your work frequently to avoid losing it like I did. *A year later, and I must amend my review: I'm on my 3rd return for repairs--first it was the battery, and then the display.
