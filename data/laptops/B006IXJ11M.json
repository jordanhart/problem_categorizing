This laptop is best for web browsing and media although it can be used in an office. I do have a few complaints. This laptop breaks easily. I have owned this laptop for about six months now and have already broken the microphone and cracked the inside of the screen. Even with these defects, the laptop is still usable and better than nothing. The keys are quite loud and the sound quality is much better with headphones. I f you are looking to install windows 8 release preview or similar products, it works great. I installed the 64- bit version and it is running perfectly. Overall I am satisfied although I will have to replace it soon due to damage.  ps- please excuse my grammar. I am only 12 years old. most people won't bother to read my reviews if they know this.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a Laptop. At this price it Rules!", "Author": "elvis3", "ReviewID": "R1XLTFQLLIXIQN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought my first laptop 20 years and have thus far been through about 12.In my educated opinion ( I repair computers for a living)this is on of the nicest, most full featured computers out there. I use a High End Sony VIO for my most difficult work but I keep a second machine to use in the field. The HDMI output is fantastic (I subscribe to Netflix) and hook this baby up giving a FABULOUS picture on a 60\" screen!I also LOVE the feature that lets you log in using Facial recognition. I personally have many confidential files and trust me nobody and I mean nobody can get access to this machine but me. There is a \"backdoor\" way of getting in but I put in a 21 character password, just in case I grow a beard or something. Trust me, if you are in the market for a laptop costing less than $500.00 then this is the one. I give it 5 stars because it is top of the line in that price range. I have ordered 12 for resale and already have 3 \"presold\"", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gret Laptop", "Author": "Brandie", "ReviewID": "REXOK513M9HMO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this laptop as a gift only 30 hours ago but I have to say so far I love it.  The only complaint I've had thus far is an issue using WiFi. As it turned out that was an problem with the Internet connection to my home and had nothing at all to do with the laptop.  As another reviewer mentioned it doesn't come with a manual but it does come with an eManual on the computer which appears as an icon.  I found the eManual to be quite helpful and easy to follow. The best review I can give you is this... my 15 year old niece also got the same laptop as a gift and she loves it.  So if it can please a teenage girl surely it will please you too.", "Date": "December 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Economical Laptop", "Author": "AP Student", "ReviewID": "R3636DM3L73PCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is a bit chunky, but considering that its an old model, that is acceptable. Battery life is a bit short, but seeing as how it refurbished, that should be expected. The keys on the keyboard are well spaced, and it is very easy to type, though sometimes a keystroke won't register. The arrow keys are placed kind of strangely, especially the right arrow, which is under the 1 in the number pad. The fleshy part of your hand under your thumb doesn't move the mouse when it brushes the trackpad while you type like some bad laptops do. However, the trackpad does leave one wanting. There are these small ridges on it which create friction and therefore makes it harder to move on. It's a minute difference, but after using Macbook Pro with a completely smooth trackpad, it's quite noticeable.  Also, you have to tap with some effort to make it register a click, and scrolling using the trackpad is a nightmare. Though it is an old model, it's still decently fast, and you can play some modern games on lowest settings on it. All in all, it's a good laptop that will fulfill all your necessities for a decent price. If you're planning to game, watch HQ videos, or do other demanding things, this isn't the computer for you. I recommend this laptop to college students or those that don't have much money who just want a basic computer. Note that this does not come with Microsoft office, and that 4 stars is still a pretty good rating.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice PC for the price.", "Author": "Yep2Happy", "ReviewID": "ROVM3S6UIAXMW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little apprehensive about buying this computer, but so far it's great.

There is a PDF version of the user guide on the computer. You need to know how to get to it.Asus is very good with their laptops, their machine always feel slim and not too bulky compare to some of the other brands. They invented netbook (eee-PC) after all. I saw on pcmagzine this laptop scored 4.9 out of 5 on user rating.TLDR: don't let the lack of user manual book & recovery CD discourage you, I guess there is a reason why GeekSquad are so successful.

Bennett", "ReviewID": "R2LJKZM2BH0D2Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this notebook for a friend who is technologically-challenged. It is advertised on Bestbuy.com as including a user manual/user's guide. It does not come with one and BB can't provide it (nor should they have to, in my opinion). After 2 1/2 days of dealing with Asus \"support\" (and I use that term loosely), I will be returning this notebook because the only user manual they can provide is an e-Manual in Spanish. Their \"support\" is offshore (gee, surprise) and they answer all questions with scripted responses without actually reading or processing the content of your email to them.  Telephone support is no better, directing me back to the online e-Manual in Spanish and offering no explanation as to why no other language is available. I can't imagine what would happen if my friend actually had a technical problem that needed support. Save yourself the hassle and the gamble of whether or not you'll be able to get support if you need it.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "INTEL:B950/PDC-2.10G 4GB/2-DIMM 320GB/5400RPM DVDRW MR GBE 802.11B/G/N WEBCAM INTEL-GMA4500/DVMT5.0 15.6HD W7HP-64 4-CELL 5.5LBS BLACK", "Name": "ASUS X54H-BD1BH Refurbished Notebook Intel Pentium B950(2.10GHz) 15.6\" 4GB Memory 320GB HDD 5400rpm DVD\u00b1R/RW Intel GMA 4500M", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51sOZdEngxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006IXJ11M"}}
