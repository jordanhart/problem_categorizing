Within a week after it arrived the keyboard backlighting stopped working.  I contacted ASUS directly about it, and they told me that it was most likely a hardware issue and that I would have to ship it a repair facility.  They refused to let me have it repaired locally.  I had already put all of my private information on this computer and I was not going to ship it to some stranger.Within a month, I had to type half of my keystrokes twice because the keyboard was so unresponsive.  It seems to work a little better now.  Maybe I just typing harder.My unit has 32gb of memory, but it acts more like 8gb.  They must have put the cheapest memory in this thing that they could find.To top it all off, a month ago the hard drive began to fail.  Fortunately I was able to back everything up before it did.  I didn't bother contacting ASUS because I knew they were going to ask me to ship it to them, so replaced it with another drive that I already owned.I will never buy another ASUS computer again, nor will I ever buy anything from Computer Upgrade King either.I paid $1850!  The most I've ever paid for a laptop, and the most I've ever been disappointed!", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Everything is perfect.", "Author": "Kokpheng Yin", "ReviewID": "RD97SVV4PDLKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This notebook is awesome, nice backlit keyboard, battery over 4h on browsing and typing, and very smooth with high performance game.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good laptop has some problms though", "Author": "Heath B.", "ReviewID": "RB5NL69UEZFSS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The laptop itself is great. Runs my games on high settings and runs my graphic design programs with no problems. The only problem i have with it is the face that the cd/dvd rom drive does not work. Computer doesnt recognize it or anything. Normally that would not be a problem since most of my programs are downloaded and I dont watch alot of movies. My problem is that now i have to use a USB dvd drive to load the programs i need for school. I didnt notice it until i went to install microsoft office on my computer the day before class started. So if your thinking about this laptop for gaming or graphic design, it works great. Just check all the features when you get it and make sure everything functions.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great upgrade", "Author": "Florczak Family", "ReviewID": "R60QTNPVSW1AK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great computer at a great price.
