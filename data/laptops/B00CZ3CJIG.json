{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great portable gaming/productivity notebook", "Author": "Chris Angelo", "ReviewID": "R9GIK7Q4ZOJJZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Finding balance between a good gaming system and portable notebook is a difficult endeavor. There are plenty of 15.6\" or 17\" screen systems out there that are able to pack the highest performing components inside, but leave your shoulder/back aching. On the other side of the spectrum, there are a number of sleek, ultra book class notebooks that are easy to carry, but leave you wanting more performance. I needed a high performance notebook that allows me to multi-task and game a bit while away from home. The MSI GE40 is a nice compromise between the two categories with a few caveats.Design:Weighing in at 4.4ish pounds, the GE40 is quite light for what it packs inside. The palm rest and lid are a brushed aluminum. The lid has eye-catching red LEDs in the form of \"dragon eyes\". The rest of the body is comprised of your standard glossy plastic that attracts finger prints, but isn't handled all that often in everyday use. There is more flex in the palm rest and keyboard than a full aluminum chassis, but it doesn't scream poor quality.Screen:My main issue with the GE40 is the quality of the screen. While it does feature a high 1600x900 resolution for a 14\" screen, it is an average TN panel with OK viewing angles. This evaluation is quite subjective although I personally think the vertical viewing angles are quite poor. You will need to view the screen dead or the images will be washed out. This left me a little frustrated trying to watch netflix on my bed.Performance:With a high wattage Intel Haswell Quad-core 4th generation processor, it chews through everything quite quickly. The lower wattage CPUs in ultrabooks are primarily designed for battery longevity and much lower thermals with decent performance. The difference between Apple's latest generation Macbook air with it's 15W Dual-Core CPU and the GE40 is very noticeable in the programs that I use (namely Acrobat Pro, Photoshop, transcode applications). The dynamic overclocking of the CPU also allows lightly threaded applications to take advantage of higher clock speeds whilst putting the unused cores to sleep.The graphics duties are shared between the integrated intel HD4600 and a dedicated NVIDIA GTX 760M. The switching is handled with NVIDIA's optimus tech. The integrated graphics are powerful enough to handle the Windows GUI acceleration, Flash, and movie playback to conserve power and reduce heat generation. The GTX 760M kicks in when you launch a full screen 3D application, allowing you to take advantage of a large performance increase. The GTX 760M did a great job of providing acceptable frame rates at the native resolution in the games I play. For specific numbers, look up the GTX 760M on Notebookcheck.comThe included 750GB 7200RPM hard disk drive is another low point of the system. I am aware of the upgraded model of the GE40 that features a 128GB solid state drive (SSD), but I opted for this model as I was planning to purchase my own SSD with more capacity. Booting into Windows is slow as is opening most applications, especially concurrently. This is problem is compounded with the preinstalled Norton security software that constantly scans on startup and application access. I've already swapped the HDD with a Sandisk Extreme II that has increased the responsiveness exponentially and plan on purchasing a HDD module to replace the DVD-Rom drive.While the GE40 has 8GB of DDR3-Low Voltage memory installed, it is a single DIMM. This is both a plus and minus. With a single DIMM, you drop your effective bandwidth to 10GB/ps for the CPU and integrated GPU. You'll be hard pressed to see a noticeable drop in performance, but this is supposed to be a high end system. On the other hand, if you were planning to go to a total of 16GB of RAM, you won't have to buy x2 8GB DIMMs. Just grab 1 8GB DIMM and you'll get your dual channel memory performance.Preinstalled Software:Windows 8: You either love it or hate it. I personally like Microsoft's new OS due to the faster performance and support for new hardware technologies. I'm not a fan of the Start Screen, but that's easily remedied with a third party start menu replacement. The product key for Windows is integrated into the UEFI BIOS of the system so you won't need to enter a key during Windows setup. Just activate once you've reinstalled the OS.As I mentioned before, Norton and other trialware is preinstalled. You'll be greeted with a number of desktop cluttering icons and background services taking up system resources. It isn't nearly as bad as some, but again, this is a gaming system that shouldn't have junk preinstalled to begin with.I personally reinstalled Windows 8 after installing an extra 8GB DIMM and a SSD to replace the HDD. Be prepared to download the wireless LAN drivers beforehand as Windows 8 doesn't come with them out of the box. There are also a plethora of other drivers that need to be reinstalled to restore full functionality (Bluetooth, WLAN switch, ETC).Noise/Heat:In normal operation, the notebook is a bit warm to the touch and the fan constantly runs at a slight hum. The fan is audible, but not overtly or annoyingly so. When gaming, the notebook does get hot. It's not unbearable, but it isn't super comfortable either. The fan kicks it into high gear and is very noisy. I was able to hear it every between explosions in game with my headphones on. Both the heat and noise levels are to be expected, especially with the amount of performance packed into such a small chassis.Overall evaluation:The MSI GE40 is a great notebook that fills my needs well. The balance of portability and performance allows me to finish my work quickly to get a little bit of play in. If you can cram your programs and games onto a 128GB SSD, you'll find more value in the upgraded version of the GE40. Otherwise both notebooks can stand to have an additional 8GB of memory and a clean install of Windows to maximize its performance and your enjoyment.Update 7/10/2013:I was curious if I could get the thermals down a bit, so I opened up my notebook again to see what kind of job MSI did with the thermal paste. As I suspected, they put way too much on which was hindering the heat transfer from the CPU and dedicated GPU to the heatpipe assembly. I'm sure it's their policy that it's better to have too much than too little.Dis-assembly was not that difficult; 8 philips screws and the fan and heatpipe was easily removed. I cleaned up the factory paste and wiped the CPU/GPU and heatpipe with some isotropic alcohol. I then applied a thin layer of artic silver 5 and put it all back together. Subjectively, the notebook runs cooler. The fan spins slower at idle and comes back down from 100% quicker after playing a game. The palm rest and WASD keys were also a bit cooler. I didn't record before and after temperatures, but there are a couple youtube videos detailing this modification and the tangible results.If you are comfortable performing this procedure, I wholeheartedly recommend doing it. Your left palm and wrist will thank you.", "Date": "July 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutly love it!", "Author": "M. Platz", "ReviewID": "R7EG3TOMAC3QH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only been using it for a few days now so I cannot say to much about the longevity of the machine, but so far I am loving it! Its very small, thin, and lightweight yet very powerful. So far I have managed to play Bioshock infinite, Far cry 3, Boarderlands 2 all on ultra settings unplugged, and on power saver mode, with playable frame rates. Turn it on performance mode and it runs silky smooth. Im getting great battery performance as well, I have yet to record the amount of time im getting with it while playing games or just surfing the web, however I would expect about 2hrs playing games on ultra settings, and about 5 surfing the web at the moment. Reviews have said it can get around 8hrs with the right settings surfing the web. The only downside would be the display, however 1600x900 is perfectly fine display for a 14\" laptop, and everything looks crystal clear to me. The sound quality is also decent considering the size of this laptop, you can only expect so much. I am loving the location of the speakers, and the grill that covers them make it seem as if they are not even there. Looks great, anyways if you are looking for a small, portable laptop that is a power house at a reasonable price, im thinking you found it! Wouldn't hesitate to recommend to a friend.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "MSI Ge40 2OC-008us review", "Author": "Paul Moos", "ReviewID": "R2C0KDZ2047AZU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This computer in theory is great, at least for the first two weeks it was...This is a great portable gaming laptop, with a quad core GHz processor and a GTX 760M fit into a small 14\" chassisIt does get toasty while playing high end games, not unexpected of course for this small of a chassis, It packs a punch, a really powerful one for its size.However the chassis itself is the only bad thing, it doesn't appear to be durable, and with a little bit of pressure I flex the screen and create a distortion on the screen itself. The main body appears to be decent, however there is a flaw (or Just me having really bad luck and getting a second faulty product).It can run very very hot, I'd reccomend getting a cooling fan if you are going to play high end games. If you push it to the max, the touchpad can get uncomfortable and so can the left palm rest, however  don't let this bug you, it may be  downside but this product makes up for it in many ways.Pros:Great hardware for a laptop of this size.Really good keyboard DesignDedicated and Silent Fan(even when playing high end games-does run hot though)Cons:Screen is a little bit smaller in Resolution than what I would have wantedweak chassis - flexibleFlexible ScreenHowever I was plagued with many thingsThe first was, The first one of these (out of three) was defective and had a broken mouse button (both left and right buttons didn't function)After spending about an hour and a half with Both MSI and Amazon on the phone, I finally managed to get a new (non faulty) replacement and declared a D.O.D. they agreed to pay for 2 day shipping, cover the insurance, and the return of the faulty computer, this was great, but it got worse...After waiting about 5 days, (since there was a very minor snowstorm at that time I thought it might be delayed), with no new package, I ended up getting frustrated, and called Both Amazon, and UPS (the company who shipped it), after about two hours in total talking to these companies, they told me to wait... I then looked up the tracking number at this time, and the UPS website, said it had been signed for and delivered, it in fact had been delivered to the wrong house....I then finally got a third computer sent to me, at this time it was over 2 weeks...when I was supposed to receive it. This one finally actually got sent to the right address. I successfully got this package, but when I got home that day, The second package had arrived....at this point over a week late. So I had to deal with returning and re-mailing the second computer.Would have given 5/5 if it hadn't been for this hassle.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "MSI GE40 2OC-008US Gaming Laptop Review", "Author": "Tobias Moos", "ReviewID": "R32UI1AR2N9A1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first computer I have gotten from MSI, I'm pleased with some aspects of this laptop but not others.It is one of the best Laptops for its price with the hardware it has crammed into a 14\" inch chassis. It runs hot when you push it to the max, but that's not unexpected for the hardware they're cramming into, so far I haven't had any problems with overheating. The hardware functions perfectly, I've had no problems with any of that. Well let's get into the Good and Bad.The Good:It's incredibly light, making it a great high performance laptop on the go. The keyboard is a perfect size and the keys are crisp and responsive.Its CPU, and GTX 760M, pack a punch, coming with 8gb of RAM less than 80$ to upgrade it to 16gb. It makes it a cost effective, portable, and powerful machine perfect for everyday use all the way to performance demanding gaming.The Bad:Overheating is a constant if you are gaming (constantly), however it isn't unbearable. The only problem I've had it that the left palm rest gets toasty after gaming for an hour or two.The touchpad is on the small side, it's not unusable nor uncomfortable, but it is smaller than I'd like or the average touchpad.The Very Bad:I don't know if it's just me and bad luck but the build quality on this laptop has been very poor, I've had to send this laptop to MSI once so far, it took them 3 weeks to fix a broken hinge, and \"Repair\" a the built in fan, the \"repair\" was wrenching the casing upwards basically inverting the dent that was there, something I could do in a minute with a screwdriver, something I expected them not to do. When they did this they caused part of the external top plastic casing on the left side of the laptop, to warp up, and it looks like it's going to crack.  They then for some unknown reason put a piece of foam on each side of the metal grill in the vent, this has caused a noticeable increase in the computers temperature, also what was once a silent fan, now has a barely audible whine, and if using the built in mic, it sounds like a jet engine starting up, I'm not kidding, I even have a recording of this. Third maybe less than a month after I got it back, the left hinge became again loos, and if I wiggle my power cord in the socket I can cause the casing where the power button is do separate from the lower chassis.All this aside it's enough for me to worry about, not mention frustrated with MSI's poor job on honoring their warranty. I've talked to a rep, they said they pay both ways but not an estimate on how long it will take on their attempt to fix Their Own mistake at repairing the computers they sell.I don't know if it's just me with a mix of bad luck, but if anyone else has something similar to this problem I'd like to know.Excluding this part I'll give it 4 stars.I would recommend getting it, but be careful with the body.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelent laptop.", "Author": "Daniel Moreno", "ReviewID": "R1VHC5KMMXN7T5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought it because I do a lot of video editing and added 8 GB of RAM to make it even better.
