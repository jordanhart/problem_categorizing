This laptop delivers amazing value for the price. HP has definately brought their 'A' game on this model. There are a couple things you *need* to know before you buy this laptop.First, the model I bought advertised a 500 GB hard drive. This is true, however it is 2 x 250 GB hard drives. Not that big of a deal, but I cannot believe it is not listed as such.Second, the laptop comes preloaded with a ton of junk and is heavily integrated with Windows Live stuff. Messenger, Live toolbar, etc. It comes with a trial of Norton Internet Security and a trial of Office 2007. My advice: Get Norton off the computer ASAP and install another anti-virus product.Third, no operating system CD's come with the package. There is a \"Recovery\" partition that contains about 12 GB of stuff (not 100% sure what exactly is on there). I do know that when setting up the computer it tells you you should create recovery CD's. I went through the setup to create the discs and here's the kicker - they want 21 CD's or 3 DVD's to create the recovery discs. Talk about stupid.As of now, I have wiped the OS partition and loaded Windows 7 Beta. The driver recognition is fantastic on Windows 7 - both my wired and wireless ethernet drivers were install out-of-the-box.The look and feel of this model is gorgeous. The 17\" HD screen is amazing and the whole laptop has this slick look and feel to it. The bronze color scheme really stands out.All in all, you cannot beat the price of this laptop. For what it comes with, a comparable model from another vendor would cost $600-700 more than what I bought mine for ($898 + tax).Last, this is just my opinion and should be taken as such. Please do yourself a favor and do not install XP on this. This laptop is too great to go back to XP. AERO does look nice and this laptop should be able to run anything you throw at it. Even a clean install of Vista should not give you any problems. While XP works great for most people, do not fight change and try to give Vista/7 a fair chance. Hell, even try the newest Ubuntu (I think 8.10) because that should look great on this too.", "Date": "February 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Bronze Beauty but keyboard illegible!", "Author": "Edmund H.

Jones \"elevenss\"", "ReviewID": "RVCZIM7UP151U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have several HP laptops with 17\" screens (dv9910us as well as this dv7-1270us). The screen size is great, but I could see that trying to carry these in a backpack for school use could be a load. The displays are fantastic and the NVidia graphics card is super. The speed for boot-up, network connectivity and multi-tasking of applications is also fabulous.This has fantastic sound for music with the Altec Lansing dual speakers on top and subwoofer on the bottom. Of course it can be hooked to a media center via the built-in HDMI or USB ports for impressive sound and Blue-ray DVD play.Battery life is about 3 - 4 hours with the power management default settings out of the box.All round this is a great package, with the few cons noted below.Cons:1. Bluetooth headsets / headphones don't work for listening to music. I've written to HP and visited forums, and it seems that there is some issue with MS Vista that Microsoft hasn't fixed. This is a bit disappointing, however, if you are planning to run with XP (which I'm not sure will work with this 64 bit microprocessor) it may be ok. I, as are many, awaiting a fix for this issue. Many have reported issues with Bluetooth Stack Service not working. I found that there is a Microsoft patch (something to do with ActiveX killbits), that causes this problem. After the Bluetooth stopped working correctly, and rebuilding my system I found that by not installing this \"fix\" the Bluetooth works for everything (phone, mp3 player, etc.), but not with the headphones - for listening to music. Headphones do work for skype and with the phone.2. The built-in Intel 5100 AGN WiFi Network adapter always indicates that its running at 54.0Mbps, even though I have a Netgear 854T Wireless-N router that can run at 300.0Mbps. If I connect a Netgear WPN121T USB adapter the HP Networking status indicates 300.0Mbps for that adapter. However, both adapters seem equally as fast for loading of webpages and downloads, so I'm not sure if the build-in Intel 5100 adapter is really running at 300.0Mbps even though it indicates on 54.0Mbps. I've been working with HP on this issue and they have not been able to fix yet.3. The touch pad (as on all of these HPs) can act bizarrely, in that the mouse will jump to some other place when you touch the pad. It doesn't happen all of the time, but can be rather annoying. I'm not sure if it has to do with the way the notebook is leveled, but I do notice that if the keyboard is not on a stable table top or work space, the mouse jumping seems to happen more frequently. The synaptic touch pad driver sw provides some settings which seem to help.4. Finally, the built-in cooling fan is noticably louder in the dv7-1270us than in the dv9910us models I have. Fortunately, in the BIOS it can be set to turn-on/off as needed, and not run continuously, so it's not too bad, but it pitch is at a frequency that causes my ears to ring if it runs very long.", "Date": "April 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "Feature packed and priced well below the competition.", "Author": "Deee Lovely \"deeeelovely\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZPQKX1Y28B07", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will start this review by saying that my old laptop was beyond slow and well past its prime, so just about anything would have been a huge improvement.  I did a fair amount of research and this laptop was by far the most feature-packed for the price.  The same specs with a different brand name would have cost me $700-$900 more, easily.The laptop is loaded with entertainment features like webcam, bluray, HDMI port, 4 USB ports, TWO headphone jacks and lightscribe!  I will admit, the lightscribe was a huge plus.  If you don't know, it's a way to laser etch artwork/words onto burned CDs/DVDs instead of using sticker labels or writing on them with permanent markers.  I have no complaints with any of this stuff because these are all features I've not had until now and I'm just excited to have them at all.  The laptop is blazingly fast compared to my old one (but that's not saying much).  It has a neat touch bar above the keyboard that lets you quickly: mute/unmute, control volume, play, pause, forward, rewind, stop, and even turn off the wifi.  It's a huge laptop, you may have a hard time finding a bag it will fit in (seriously), but it's not an issue for me.  I love having such a large screen and I don't move the laptop around much (I would not have purchased a laptop this large for heavy travel).  I also love that it has a full sized keyboard (YAY!) and a separate number keypad off to the right for super speedy number crunching!  It has a cute little remote control so you can hook the laptop up to your TV and use it as a sometimes bluray/DVD player, it even stores in the side of the laptop when not in use.  I also like that this machine doesn't seem to get hot at all...my old laptop you could fry eggs on that thing for how hot it ran!The not so great stuff:It comes with Vista and I don't like it, but it's not the laptop's fault, they all come with Vista now, don't they.It has a lot of bloatware (a lot of preinstalled software that you probably don't need and just having it there takes up space and hogs memory/resources) and no easy way to remove it without doing a wipe/reinstall...and it does not come with Vista CDs to do that which complicates things a bit.I read a lot of reviews talking about the keys being almost unreadable, for everything else that came with this machine for this price...I was willing to paint them on myself if it was really that bad!  I'm not sure if HP fixed the problem or if I'm not using the laptop in the same conditions as those with the complaints, but I can see/read them fine (I use the laptop indoors with ambient/indirect sun lighting for the most part).  The keys and laptop are a metallic bronze color, so it has a bit of a mirror like finish that I could certainly do without...but it is not nearly as obnoxious/annoying/blinding as the laptops with that chrome/silver mirror finish. That's all with the aesthetics; not the important stuff (not to me anyway).For the price and being chock full of features, I can't justify taking off a star for any of the very minor flaws.  I've had this for almost a month now and I love it. I will update this review once I've had it longer should anything change or need mentioning.", "Date": "July 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good laptop, but with one fatal flaw", "Author": "John Brook Monroe \"Tech guy and home cook\"", "ReviewID": "R13MW9Z0KJZYUR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The flaw is not, as some people have suggested, in the keyboard.  It's in the chrome strip on which the power button rests, along with a volume control, and the single, only, solitary, absolutely-no-other-way-to-do-this, wireless switch.  The wireless switch isn't a positive contact mechanical switch like the power button--it's a capacitance \"touch\" location which ceases to function if the chrome strip happens to short against something.  This not only turns off the wireless and makes turning it back on virtually impossible, it also causes the audio volume slide area to short, which makes the audio volume dialog strobe on and off repeatedly, accompanied by a cascade of annoying clicks.We are returning the laptop to HP for warranty repairs on the hardware, and hoping that the unit comes back completely fixed.I think that making the wireless functional only through a single, highly-suspect switch is a bad design.  I've expressed this view to HP already.Beyond that issue (and we have the chrome, not the bronze finish), I think the laptop excels in all other ways.  I'll be happy to see it back and functioning in about...oh, maybe 10 days from now.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "HP Pavilion dv1260us w/ 17\" Screen", "Author": "Dr. Miles", "ReviewID": "R2MOOYRQYAW02L", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have had my HP Pavilion dv1260us for 7 months now.  At first, I was totally jazzed by the unit - a great 17\" screen, which I love, along with many other great features.  It was fast and worked great.  But then, after 5 or 6 months of fairly heavy use, I began having problems.Before I get into those, let me say that I took very good care of the laptop - using it only at home - not taking it anywhere or abusing it in any way.  (Due to severe space constraints, I choose to use a laptop rather than a desktop computer.)  Since I use an added wireless keyboard, I do not have an issue with the laptop's keyboard as expressed in other comments.Without going into long, tedious details, the main problems consisted of the DVD player failing.  I contacted HP tech support, which I personally think is very good - I got e-mail replies within a couple of hours and they continued to try to work with me.  Bottom line, I never did get the DVD player to work, which in many ways makes the computer useless as you cannot play your movies or music on disk and you cannot download the software programs that come with new hardware items such as printers, etc.The other major thing that started to happen was the computer just began shutting down for no apparent reason.  I contacted HP tech support and tried many interventions without fixing the problem.  The most recent thing (disaster!) which happened was all of a sudden I got a blue screen with the dreaded message: \"Fatal System Failure.\"  I have no formal training with computers; however, I have used them for years and have sort of learned along the way.  So, I tried everything that I could think of and finally got the laptop to boot up.  Everything looked okay, except as I checked things out further, I discovered that I had lost all of my files!  I was so grateful that just 3 weeks before I had subscribed to a back-up service which daily scans and stores the contents of your computer, so I was able to successfully restore everything.  (By the way, I highly recommend getting a reputable back-up service.  It can prevent disaster!)So, now everything is restored (at least for the moment) and I haven't had a shut-down in a while, but the DVD unit still does not work.  Plus, I have \"lost faith\" in the computer.  With the kind of work that I do, which includes being a webmaster, I MUST have a reliable machine that I can trust.Rather than return the computer and go thru whatever delays that may entail, I have decided to try a different brand.  I had poor luck with my last HP Pavilion, so I am ready for a brand change.  The other computer also had problems with the DVD unit.  In my opinion, HP does not produce the high-quality computers that they used to a while back.My very first computer many years ago was an Acer, which I had good luck with, so I have decided to go back and give that brand a re-try.  I will return this HP unit for whatever repair or replacement HP may give, but I will not use it as my primary computer.I hope this review has been useful.  I think many times a review is done before the \"honeymoon\" for a given product is over and in my opinion many of those early reviews are skewed towards the positive.  Since I have had this computer for over 6 months, I do think this review might be a bit more accurate than those done after just a few weeks or less of product use.

It provides for more computing power and functionality than any laptop in its class/price-range.The most appealing feature of this laptop is its superior casing and finish. Its very glossy and stands out with a bright light of the HP logo on the top lid (back of the monitor). The illuminating MediaSmart touch-sensitive functions above the keyboard also make it a uniquely designed laptop. Its color has an eloquent yet stylish appeal.This laptop is not all cosmetic, however. It comes with enough processing power and memory to take on heavy duty multimedia for your audio and video needs. The sound quality is amazing with the Altec Lansing speakers providing SRS premium sound. It even has a great built in HP web cam with HP software to make taking tasteful pictures and recording professional video a cinch for even an amateur. This model does not have the built in TV Tuner or thumb print security features advertised on similar HP models. It does come with a preloaded version of Vista with SP1 and has Microsoft Office Home and Student trial version packaged for an out-of-the-box experience.The laptop display is crystal clear with stunning graphic quality on a 17\" monitor. Plenty of room with a full functioning keyboard and number pad that will make you feel as though you are using a desktop keyboard. I tried this laptop out for an entire day when I received it and it has proven well worth its price.I was very satisfied with the Next Day shipping as the laptop arrived on time and had no noticeable defects. There was some adhesive tape stuck to the edge of the laptop, but was easily removed and with no physical damage to the device.Incredibly this computer packs a lot of punch and is still light weight. It does not overheat even on your lap with a 2.4 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo. Beautiful LED lights flood the keyboard against the glossy chrome finish making it a perfect display for use in a dark or dim lit room.The WiFi card is wonderful with extended range. I was able to pick up my router from the end of my drive way and even at the end of the street. The remote is included for media functionality. You can listen to your music or watch videos without having to touch the keyboard or mouse. The wireless remote fits neatly inside the dedicated slot above the SD-MS/Pro card reader. You've got 4 USB ports (2 on each side) and an place to plug in your HDMI cable to your HD TV. This is wonderful for me to give live presentations on an HD TV at work at conferences.This is definitely a lot of bang for you buck. I had a Compaq Pressario laptop before this, which I bought on a limited budget at the time. I didn't think the battery would die on me so soon. This HP was definitely worth the extra cash.I was originally thinking of buying a Dell before I bought the HP DV7, but considering the huge difference in price and much faster delivery this was a sweet deal. The Dell would have taken 4 days longer to ship with a higher shipping cost (on expedited shipping) and with the same specifications (at a $500 price tag difference).

The 17-inch screen is marvelous and the laptop's design and the chrome/bronze finish is sharp and makes it look so much more expensive than it actually is.  It is not as portable as other laptops but is an acceptable trade-off to have a big screen.  The keys are very comfortable and have a nice soft touch, the space bar is short and works well ergonomically, and the keyboard is laid out with number keys off to the right, which is useful.  Both for work and for play [media applications], you feel like you have a mini flat screen TV on your desk.My review of this laptop is mixed however.  This HP Pavilion refreshes slower than the Compaq Presarios my kids have.  Also, when changing the appearance of the menu and other texts, there are some fonts that end up with less fidelity - parts of letters are faded!  The worse is the white color of the letters/symbols on the keyboard.  They are very hard to see against a bronze background.  If you look at the keys from the right side at an angle, the letters and symbols are very visible.  But who would crank their necks this far to type?  When looking directly over the keys, more than half of the letters and symbols are nearly invisible!

I learned how to type without looking, so it is not that much of a problem, but a problem it is in low light situations.  The touchpad is right where I rest my thumbs while typing.

The video card (an Nvidia 9600M GT) handles most modern gaming titles on low-to-moderate graphics settings.  I'm not aware of many notebooks below $1,000 that can play GTA 4 in medium resolution, but HP's dv7 definitely makes the grade here.  With the addition of a Blu-Ray ROM drive, the value of this machine becomes even greater.There's ample memory and processor power for handling most tasks with ease.  Even though the unit can be upgraded to 8 GB of RAM, I believe most users will find the 4 GB of included memory more than adequate.  The biggest performance killer is HP's Total Care Advisor, which I recommend un-installing once setup is completed.Another nice surprise was the machine's speakers.  Typical laptop sound systems are lacking in quality, but the dv7 is one of the best I have heard.  Having a sub-woofer on the bottom is probably what makes the difference.  Whether you're listening to music or watching a Blu-Ray movie, the enhanced audio capability is a nice addition.My only complaint is the silver, mirror-like touchpad.  It is a smudge magnet!

The heating issues lead to it running very slowly, randomly freezing and crashing, and not starting up even when plugged into a power source. It also would get extremely hot in two specific places: the upper left and lower left of the frame around the keyboard. It took forever to start up even when it was new. 5-7 minutes from the time you hit the \"On\" button until you're connected to a wireless network. The computer's fan is extremely noisy and runs constantly even when there is no dust to overheat the inner components (I looked). It comes loaded with bloatware and while I was pleasantly surprised with the AMD processor it's still nowhere near the speed of an Intel. Also, it's not real HD. Eventually the overheating made the motherboard fry which I can't say I'm too surprised about. The volume and wireless network buttons are a joke: a touchpad that you drag your finger across.
