I read the reviews on the Best Buy site before purchasing this laptop, and the majority of them that had complaints had complaints of encountering blue screens of death within a short amount of time of purchasing the laptop.  Others had issues with the sensitivity of the touch pad, but overall there were positive reviews.While I was removing some of the unwanted software like the Best Buy app, I encountered a blue screen of death.  This was because when I restarted to complete the uninstall of some of the programs, it did NOT install the windows updates.  Once these were installed, I haven't had a problem since.  So once you get your computer, make sure you shut down to install updates, and then commence removing the bloatware.Pros: Nice screen size, has good enough specs to run several mildly heavy programs at the same time, HDMI port, excellent keyboard (it doesn't have the traditional bracketed keys, but the more embedded buttons like the Mac Books, plus a num pad), solid design, runs very quiet and cool (extremely cool. With it sitting on my lap it does not even get warm.), good battery life if you use the energy management for it, fingerprint reader, facial recognition, and built in webcam.Cons: Touch pad is a little sensitive, but I came from using a Thinkpad where I used the touch point mouse. It may just be because I need to get used to it.  External mouses are always a compromise.Overall a very good computer for the price.", "Date": "August 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Value Priced Laptop", "Author": "Derek Shockley", "ReviewID": "R3H4ROVDEQC85B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because my wife and I are both in school, and one laptop is not enough.

My budget was VERY tight..(350$ Total MAX everything included tax also)NO refurbs unless they came with alike NEW warrantyNo used2. I needed it to do basic tasks while being able to handle Light gaming (World of warcraft,Diablo 3,SC2,Steam games) and still have a respectable battery life3. I wanted the build quality to also not TOTALLY suck even though it is an extreme budget class.Tall order for a 350$ budget right?  This laptop accomplished that on 299$  Purchased from bestbuyLet me start by saying this will be a fairly short review (Though i will add additional information upon request if someone wants to know something specific)Full Specifications:CPU: AMD E 450 APU 1.65 Ghz Dual coreGPU: ATI 6320 Intergrated into the APUHD: 5400 RPM HD 320GBRam: 4 GB DDR3Display: widescreen LED (1366 x 768) 15.6OS: Windows 7 64 bit PremiumWireless B+G+NFingerprint ReaderPort Locker4 USB slotsHDMI OUTWebcamera 0.3 MPProduct Height 1.3\"Product Width 14.9\"Product Weight 5.2 lbs.Product Depth 9.9\"Keyboard Full size Chiclet with Number pad6 in1 media reader slotPerformance: Thus far i have play tested Diablo 3 And world of warcraft with the following resultsWorld of Warcraft using Lowest settings and the default Resolution Provides a consistent 30-45 FPS in a large scale Battleground enviorment (Settings can be turned slightly higher in 5 mans or questing solo)Diablo 3 Is quite playable at 20-30 FPS on lowest settings i was very surprised this game was playable at ALL on this machine let alone respectably playable at thatHD movie playback 720P is without issues on NetflixMultitasking is ok as long as you don't get TOO unreal once i had Pandora WoW Chrome with 4 tabs open you could notice slowdown not apparent in better CPU's.The machine sadly however comes with TONS of bloatware you either need to uninstall or do a fresh reformat to get the max performance out of this machineBuild QualityThe keyboard is great with almost zero flex unless pushed very hard, palm rest area is equally strong..My biggest concern is the plastic behind the LCD is VERY weak and can be flexed VERY easily...I can produce no screen ripple pushing upon it..however it is a worry if the laptop sits inside a bag for long periods traveling and gets bumped around a ton.  Also the DVD drive is a bit worrysome as it shoots out much like a bullet and the tray is very stiff..not smooth at all.  The biggest annoyance is the USB/Power cord slot...they are the stiffest i have EVER encountered...i thought i was going to have to buy a mallet to work a USB mouse into any of the ports...it's insane you REALLY need to push to get anything in them..The power cord is also slightly stiff but not as bad.  The Screen is what it is..it has apparent light leakage to be expected for a budget machine but is largely not noticable when gaming or video watching..it's Plenty bright even on LOW which is fantastic for battery savings.BatteryThus far the only test i have run was playing World of Warcraft on LOW brightness but HIgh performance the laptop lasted 3 Hours 22 Minutes before shutting down.  I will add further Battery tests as i go through them myself with time.HeatHeat on this machine is fairly non existant even when gaming under load their is a tiny bit of warmth on the left Palm rest side when under heavy load but nothing of major concern.Ultimately i went with lenovo as when you are dealing with this price range you are dealing with cheap build quality across the board and compared to similar brands/specs this was the best built of the bargains and Lenovo has a great reputation", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lenovo Laptop for college student", "Author": "Reed", "ReviewID": "R2WLUFKE22QORR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just recieved this laptop a few days ago and it it working out very well for me, easy to use and decently fast.

I have owned Gateway, Acer, Dell, and Toshiba laptops over the last 10 years.  I hate this Lenovo and will be looking for a new laptop in next few weeks.  Will give this one to my grand kids to play games on.First, the touchpad is so sensitive that even as I was writing this review, I touched somewhere and the entire page jumped so low I had to recover with the mouse back to the text area.  I truly hate it.  Additionally, the touchpad is positioned so far to the left, you almost always have your hand on the right side of touchpad and it will go wild when touched on the right side.Second, Lenovo suggests they have a fast boot optimizer.  Oh well, some mornings it takes it about 4 minutes to actually show anything on the screen.  Worst boot time I have ever experienced.  And yes, I have run their optimizer many times.Third, when I use a browser, even with all the RAM, the hard drive spins like crazy and you can not move up or down the page until all 'ads' are fully loaded.  The mouse just stays in a spin status until the ads fully load up.  I have tried it with Explore, Chrome, and Foxfire.  All do the same.  Very disgusting!  Never experienced this before on any laptop, netbook, or tablet that I have owned.That's enough!  If you love the machine and want to buy it cheap, let me know.

My LAN line still has Windows 98 and still works great so instead of doing an upgrade decided to try a laptop enabling me to get out of the house; going to local \"hot spots\" to study. I chose this laptop from Best Buys for the price, rating, and easy access to support (Geek Squad). I've had my laptop for just over 3 years and after an initial issue, which was resolved quickly through the Geek Squad, it has been a great tool and true work horse. I use it for everything now; thinking of retiring my desktopI just recently learned that I should not be leaving the battery in when I using it mostly with the AC adapter. I very rarely use it off the adapter. After three years none of the issues I've been told about are happening. I still have the same battery and get about 3 hours of battery usage, which is all I've ever gotten, I think. If I should be getting more, I'm still not at all disappointed.

Most of the time, it takes less than a minute to boot up, the screen is clear, and it's a large enough screen for me. I love how easy it is to type on the keyboard. The touchpad is a little off center to the left, but that doesn't bother me the way it could annoy some people. The only thing that I don't really like about this laptop is that it feels a bit cheap. When there's a DVD in it, it'll start spinning really fast, and it'll start making a loud rattling noise. The front cover of the laptop feels a little flimsy and the plastic frame around the screen is plastic-y and loose. Other than the rattling though, this laptop works pretty much perfectly.Edit: Now that I've had this laptop for almost a few months, I figured this review needed an update.I had originally given it four stars, but I dropped it down to three. My DVD drive randomly stopped working for two months, and I almost bought a new external drive. I decided to check it one last time before I bought a new one, and it started working. I've still been a little nervous that it'll randomly stop working again. It also goes so much slower now that it's not brand new. On average, it takes 3 minutes to start up and log me on, and every time I try to open a program, it takes at least 20 seconds for it to open.On top of that, the screen isn't very good. I like to edit photos on my computer, but it's really hard to tell whether or not the color looks good because it's hard to tell what the actual picture looks like because the colors are pretty dull on this screen compared to other screens. The screen resolution is also not that great, either. I've ordered photos online from multiple places, and a lot of my pictures are blurry, but I could't tell on my computer. I've also looked at my pictures on some school computers that have better resolution, and it's much easier to edit the pictures on the school computers rather than my laptop.This laptop does function well enough, but I'll be upgrading to a Macbook Air this fall when I leave for college. It'll be lighter, sturdier, and faster than this one. My younger brother doesn't have a laptop and never has, so I'll be giving this one to him. He's very excited to have his own computer, and this laptop is definitely better than the ancient laptops that need to be plugged into an Ethernet cord in order to have internet connection.If you have any questions, feel free to ask!", "Date": "October 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "For the price, it really is an amazing computer.", "Author": "birdsofafeather220", "ReviewID": "R3L9EFMJCBQVG9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was on the hunt for a low cost, high quality laptop.The things that I was looking for in a laptop were:-A clear, bright screen-At least 14 inch screen-Fast!-An island keyboard-A number pad-Under $350 total-Windows 7-webcam and mic-clear sound-disk input-memory card inputI bought this laptop at best buy. I hunted around at other stores such as walmart, office depot and even here on amazon but in the end found it at best buy and bought it a day later. It fit literally EVERYTHING on my list and I couldn't be  more thrilled. It's so fast and bright I have no complaints.I use it mostly for online things. Youtube is so fast! It's faster than my desktop that cost me over $1000 two years ago. There is no lagging. I play games that are slow on all of my other friends laptops such as OMGPOP and Pottermore and have no issues with lagging. I don't download much, just a few things like GIMP, Skype and MS Word.The pros are all of the things I listed that I wanted. It really does include all those things and it does them well. The color is beautiful and the keyboard is perfect for what I wanted.Some cons would be the battery life. It's short. As in, really short. You can expect probably 3 and a half hours max out of it. For me that doesn't really matter since I always have it plugged in when I'm using it, or I only use it for a little while unplugged. Another con would be the body shape. It's very square and the edges are really \"sharp\". Not really sharp but pointy? It can start to hurt your arm depending upon how you rest it. One more thing that I feel the need to mention, but you can easily fix when you set it up is the pinch zoom. Anytime you have anything other than your one finger resting on the key pad (even by accident) and are viewing a webpage it will start scrolling in and out spasticly. You can change that in the control panel though, so it was an easy fix.One thing that really has helped me improve the speed and quality of my experience is uninstalling and removing all of the \"garbage\" software. I got rid of Norton and got AVG since it's smaller. I also I got rid of countless other softwares and I have noticed how much FASTER my computer goes. It's really crazy how much little things like that can make a difference. Not that it was slow before but now it's just crazy fast.I give it a 4 out of 5 stars because while I LOVE it, bad battery life can be seen as a horrible problem to some.For this price though, you really can't get any better. It's a very nice laptop that  would be a perfect match for anyone who isn't looking for a Macbook quality.Despite the fact that lenovo is a less known brand, I recommend you take a leap of faith.

I mostly use this for schoolwork, which means PowerPoint, Word, Internet research and the occasional internet surfing here and there, so I may not be the ideal reviewer for this product under those looking for a gaming computer or something that needs to be blisteringly fast. But given the simple tasks I ask of it, it has performed much better than I could have anticipated.Pros:- Runs very cool and quiet (not even warm on my lap)- Power management settings, when tuned properly, have allowed me to work 5.5 hours continuous on a full charge- Smooth keyboard - I love to type on this computer. Its quiet and it glides as I type.- Nice widescreen- Fingerprint security is neat, and there is a security program to password protect the computer from any USB device plugged in. There is also a face recognition security program (have not used). All of these make this machine ideal for those concerned over privacy or those who live with immature imbeciles that think its funny to mess with someones computer :)- Charger folds up nice and tight for easy transport (compared to computers of similar size)- 4 USB ports, HDMI and eSATA ports- Full 10 digit numerical keypad on keyboard for faster number inputCons:- Edge on front of computer is not smooth and digs into my palms when surfing the internet, but not an issue when typing or the computer is on my lap (only happens when it is on my desk)- The full 10 digit numerical keyboard cramps the keyboard just a bit. This also pushed the touchpad left of center, so to use the keyboard and touchpad comfortably it means you are about 2 - 2.5 inches left of center. For some this may be annoying or hard to get used to, but since I rarely sit directly centered in front of my TV it was easy to adjust to.Overall the pros greatly outweigh the cons and I significantly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable laptop for business/school use.", "Date": "March 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not purchase Lenovo.... ever", "Author": "Christopher", "ReviewID": "RTJRJ0CM41RI7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will start by saying I don't know if you can purchase the B575 any longer, but after the experiences I have had with it I will not purchase a Lenovo anything ever again. I have hated it since day one, being conned into purchasing it at Best Buy in lieu of a Toshiba (they were sold out the day the ad came out). I had my previous cheap Toshiba (the cheapest version) for 4.5 years and felt I got a good run out of it. I used it for web surfing, emails, and downloading/editing pictures. Since this had twice the RAM I thought I'd give it a try. I have hated it since I turned on it and it took 2.5min to open to my desktop. It asked if I wanted to optimize, and I did. I have now optimized 6 times in the 8 months I have owned it, as it has never booted in less than a Min and a half. Usually taking around 2 min. That was irritating, but the touch pad is the WORST. I have had entire pages written in an email or Christmas letter, only to accidentally brush the pad with my right hand and lose EVERYTHING. Don't even know how that's possible. It also re-sizes the screen constantly. Recently I was traveling and assume my screen was damaged/cracked in transit. I have contacted tech support and did live chat on their website, and received no answers on what my options were. Apparently their one year warranty covers everything EXCEPT the screen.

Was OK out of the box (keyboard layout takes a little getting used to, but bright screen, light, long battery life). However, when some BSODs occurred, our IT techs recommended an upgrade from Win 7 Home to Win 7 Pro both for better security as well as program compatibility.As we have since learned from searching online as well as our experience, the B575 does NOT handle clean installs of Win 7 Pro (even with complete driver sets downloaded from the Lenovo support site). The are two major problems:1) Power downs don't work right. No matter how you power down the unit (hibernate, sleep, etc.) the only way to get the system back is to hold down the power button for ~10 seconds, thus causing a hard power off and requiring a cold restart. Nothing else works. At all. Unless you do a hard power down right away, the system will also stay in some kind of sleep mode until the battery drains.2) Wireless access requires a workaround each time you boot. If you autoboot, the system will see the wireless card and claim it is working OK, but WILL NOT be able to see any networks, and there will be a red X through the wireless icon. Nothing you do can fix it. The ONLY way to make it work is to hit F12 during the cold boot sequence and enter the boot manager. When you do that, select either \"start from hard disk\" or \"Windows boot manager\" (doesn't matter which) and the wireless will work when the boot completes. Go figure. If you miss the 2-3 second window for hitting F12 (as indicated by bottom line of boot screen) you will need to restart and try again.Lenovo's only response so far has been to offer to sell us (for $89) Win 7 Home DVD's along with a migration to Win 7 Pro. In response, our IT department's response is to shake their heads and steer people away from these laptops.
