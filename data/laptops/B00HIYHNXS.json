Excellent customer service!!!  After ordering a windows 7 PC I decided to upgrade to Windows 8(my initial mistake), and chased DVD drivers becoming uninstalled.  With no help from the O.E.M. laptop provider or windows, Eluktronics re-installed the drivers for me and provided me a wonderful machine!!!  Excellent customer service and the bottom line is they stand behind their products and strive for complete customer satisfaction.  With great prices and safe packaging you will be happy you chose Eluktronics for your next laptop!!!!", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Close enough to a perfect development laptop in 2014", "Author": "Mark Twain", "ReviewID": "R32DOFF2IWY9XR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I use this laptop for browsing, email, nntp, ftp, rdp, plus win32 and win64 software development.  I have had it for two weeks.Pros:SILENT during casual operation. Reasonably quiet when doing intensive disk i/o e.g. copying 4gb files.  Fan turns off as soon as disk i/o is complete.  No fan noise related to use of the wireless network.Very Fast.  Quick startup.Plenty of disk space.Windows 7 license was nice.Love having 4 usb ports.  USB 3.0 speed is very helpful.Speed of copying between the two internal HDDs is very fast.I am able to run 2 guest Win7 virtualbox machines without taxing the system.  Probably it can do more but I have not needed to yet.Cons:The touchpad is annoying because, as others have reported, some clicks are not picked up and must be repeated.  I usually use an external usb mouse and keyboard, but when I have to use the built-in track pad, I get frustrated.The built-in keyboard is not bad. Personally I do not like the placement of the Enter button as the far-right-bottom key, but that's only a problem when I do not have my own external keyboard handy.  I can work almost twice as fast using my external keyboard; if you are a touch typist and care about typing speed and accuracy, you will want to use your own external keyboard.The color yellow does seem odd (wrong shade, too extreme) in photos, etc. but I don't do graphics design and I can live with that. I have not hunted for a device upgrade for the video color problem.WiFi (with out-of-the-box driver) is intermittently problematic after resuming Windows.  Sometimes a reboot or multi-minute delay is required for the WiFi network to reconnect.  No issues with wired LAN connection.  Compared to my prior (noisy Sony VIAO) laptop which had zero WiFi problems, this one gets cursed frequently, but only after resuming Windows.  It is always reasonable on first boot-up and sometimes fine after Windows napping.NOTES as of 29-May-2014:* It seems that Toshiba strongly prefers to support Windows 8 not Windows 7 now.  The user manual PDF assumes Windows 8.  The web camera does not work out-of-the-box with Skype in Windows 7.  The HDMI *audio* does not work out-of-the-box with Windows 7. (Video goes to HDMI but audio does not.) Specifically, Sound > Playback does not have an HDMI target on Windows 7.  If I had known that when I started, I probably would have gone with a Win8 O/S plus one of those give-me-back-my-start-charm add-ons for Win8.* After updating to the 16-Apr-2014 Intel Wifi driver version 17.0.2.5, my network disconnect problems have cleared up.  Huge improvement.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "GOOD DEAL", "Author": "DOUG PISKAC", "ReviewID": "R3SXJ7NP63SP11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop due to the screen size its a dream to own.
