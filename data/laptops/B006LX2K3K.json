In terms of features, processing power, and memory (processing and storage) this laptop beat all comperably priced models by a landslide. A comperable laptop in terms of performance was at least another $150.Now that I have used if for a few weeks, I am stil impressed. Satisfies the intneded need perfectly, and I have also loaded up some software development and simulation software which the machine handles just fine.I highly recommend this is an excellent choice for a general purpose laptop.", "Date": "August 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my new computer!", "Author": "Chella", "ReviewID": "R2BLA52ID63QYS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i have been using my new computer for one week now and i love it!  love that it's compact and not oversized.  it's pretty fast and i love the keyboard!  the only thing i wish was different is the screen, not a big fan of the glossy screen, but not a deal breaker.  i also wish it was just a little ligher, but other than those two items, i am very happy! i recommend this computer to everyone!", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "DISAPPOINTED", "Author": "Gina Gill \"treasures of books\"", "ReviewID": "R2R1CAYX7MA4EM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The computer arrived with a dead battery!
