When I came across this Acer, I was pretty surprised. Price was great, screen size was good and the form factor was surprisingly impressive for the price. After receiving it, I'm still happy with my choice. The laptop feels very well built and the keyboard is very easy to type on. The lower end Pentium processor is still capable when compared to an i3. The only gripes I have are the screen resolution and the trackpad. The resolution of the screen is very low so everything is very large and sometimes things don't look quite right. I'm getting used to it already but it's worth pointing out. The trackpad isn't great either as it's somewhat inaccurate and sensitive but for a lower end laptop, you take what you get.Overall, I am happy with V5. After some getting used to, it's a great cheap laptop and I'd recommend it to anyone.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "Annie", "ReviewID": "R9WATF4035R3W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I order used laptop and this one was great than I expected.
