{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid workhorse laptop", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "R13VLYJFUU3P0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The HP 2000 series laptops are budget priced, everyday use PCs that are a good choice for any user who doesn't require lots of bells and whistles from their computer.  These laptops are not for 'gamers' or those who are looking for blazing fast performance while photo and video editing, but they will please individuals looking for an inexpensive PC to surf the Internet, email, complete homework assignments, explore social media sites like Facebook, and watch online videos from sites like YouTube.The HP 200-2d22dx is an excellent buy if you can get it for under three hundred.  Solid build quality, nice screen and keyboard, as well as an HDMI port and big hard drive are selling points. It lacks Bluetooth, although a cheap USB Bluetooth adapter will fix that issues. Something like this: Medialink USB Bluetooth Adapter - Version 4.0 (Newest Available) Class 2 Smart Ready Adapter with Low Energy Technology - Compatible with Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Windows Vista / Windows XP works perfectly.Having Level 3MB of Level 3 cache slows things down a bit.  If the i3 had been paired with L2 cache there would be a slight improvement in speed, but most wont' notice this as an issue, partiucularly if they upgrade the memory to the maximum 8GB (4GB is installed in 1 dimm, leaving 1 slot free for a 4GB upgrade).This laptop has a media card reader and webcam built into it, as well as a DVD burner (reads DVDs and CDs) which is lacking in some laptops these days to make them lightweight.  This laptop weighs under 6 pounds, which is fairly light and would still be considered 'ultraportable' and suitable for students.The 6-cell battery gives you between 3 and 4 hours of battery life, depending upon how you're using your PC.  For example, if you're watching Netflix or a movie on DVD, the battery drains more quickly than if you're typing emails.The keyboard is full-sized, but not back lit.  I have found you have to pay a bit more for that perk, but again USB accessories save the day!  Get a USB powered light: LE USB 13 LED Flexible Light Lamp for Laptop Pc Notebook [Electronics] is a cheap and easy way to get the job done. Use it to shine down on your keyboard, a work around if you expect to use it in low light conditions.  I'd also suggest a USB powered 4 port hub like this: Sabrent 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub with Individual Power Switches and LEDs (HB-UMLS) to give you more USB ports, as they tend to get used up quickly.  At least at my house!  The PC has (3) USB 2.0 ports, but none of the newest, faster 3.0 USB, which was a tad disappointing.Video graphics are acceptable for this laptop, but not top notch.  This is generally where budget laptops lag, and this PC is no exception.  You'll not notice it as an issue for general use, but if you are into photo or video editing, you may want to consider another laptop.  The integrated graphics are the issue more than the HD LED screen (1366 x 768).  This is NOT a touchscreen laptop.  You will need to pay a bit more for that enhancement.Sound is fair.  It can be improved by using standard wired headphones or via the addition of Bluetooth accessories such as headphones or speakers.  *Again, a Bluetooth adapter would come in handy because you can pair this laptop via Bluetooth (not included) with an inexpensive Bluetooth headset or speakers. AmazonBasics Portable Bluetooth Speaker and Kinivo BTH220 Bluetooth Stereo Headphone - Supports Wireless Music Streaming and Hands-Free calling (Black) or similar will work with a USB adapter.Overall, the glossy black finish is attractive, but it does pick up fingerprints very easily.  I'd keep a AmazonBasics Microfiber Cleaning Cloth, (Pack of 24) handy to wipe it down every so often.I recommend this laptop for the basics.  The HP 2000 series laptops are not the fastest, sexiest laptops, but they are sturdy and relatively cheap.  Perfect for students completing homework, and grandparents who like to Skype, surf and email.  Those who  need a solid laptop for basic tasks will find this a good choice if priced right at three hundred or below.TIP #1: No matter what your usage,  I recommend a fairly cheap upgrade to the maximum 8GB of memory with (1) more 4GB memory dimm.  More is always better in this area, and it really helps with overall stability and speed of your system. HP 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM Memory Module - 4 GB - 1333MHz DDR3-1333/PC3-10600 - DDR3 SDRAM SoDIMM should fit the bill, but double check before purchasing with the installed RAM.  See the HP site or your manual for where the memory bay is located and once open, see the installed memory for brand (which varies) and type to make sure this is what you need.TIP #2: Upon unboxing, immediately go to Microsoft downloads and getting your FREE upgrade to Windows 8.1 operating system.  Do it before adding your info and programs for the best results.  8.1 gives you the 'Start' button Windows 7 had, which is much easier for those of us who were used to the latter.Below are this PCs specs per the HP site:Product Name 2000-2d22DXMicroprocessor 2.5GHz 3rd generation Intel Core i3-3120M ProcessorMicroprocessor Cache 3MB L3 CacheMemory 4GB DDR3 SDRAM (1 DIMM)Memory Max Maximum supported = 8GBMemory Slots 2 user accessibleVideo Graphics Intel HD graphics 4000 with up to 1696MB total graphics memoryDisplay 15.6-inch diagonal HD BrightView LED-backlit display (1366x768)Hard Drive 750GB 5400RPM hard driveMultimedia Drive SuperMulti DVD burnerNetwork Card 10/100BASE-T Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 connector)Wireless Connectivity 1x1 802.11b/g/n WLANSound Altec Lansing dual speakersKeyboard:  Full-size keyboard - no back lightingPointing Device Touchpad supporting multi-touch gestures with on/off buttonExternal Ports Multi-format digital media card reader for Secure Digital cards3 Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.01 HDMI1 VGA (15-pin)1 RJ-45 (LAN)1 Headphone-out1 Microphone-inDimensions  1.20 in (min H)/ 1.41 in (max H) x 14.80 in (W) x 9.72 in (D)Weight 5.39 lbPower 65W AC adapter6-cell 47WHr 2.2 Ah lithium-ion batteryFront facing HP TrueVision HD Webcam with integrated digital microphoneUPDATE: 4/23/14This PC could easily stream content wirelessly over a home network if used in combination with a Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player.
