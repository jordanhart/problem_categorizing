The newer the better, right?  A big NO NO after I have done my research before my purchase of x240.  please do NOT buy this X240 model, you will be in deep regret if you do.  check out lenovo.com's X240 reviews, see what people say over there.comparing with X230, X240 is a majob leap backward performanace wise.1. Use U(Ultrabook) CPU in X240  instead of M(Mobile) CPU used in X230.  If you google it and check the cpu scores, the fastest U cpu in X240 is slower than my 2 years old M CPU.  U CPU means slower but save the battery (who cares the battery, most of time you plug in).  What is getting into your mind, Lenovo, who will spend money to upgrade into a less powerful machine.  We want a mobile workhorse to do serious computing, if not, we would get a Samsung tablet instead.2. X240 is too fat and heavy for an Ultrabook (weight, size),  if you want to use this for Ultrabook, you will be disappointed.3.  X240 only has one memory slot which supports up to 8 GB memory while my X230 has 2 slots supporting 16GB memory.  Note, CPU and Memory are the most important things in your laptop in terms of performance.  Why only one slot?????!!!!4.  X230 has 3 USB3.0 ports while X240 has only 2.  When you try to connect all of your gadgets, you will know how important an extra USB3.0 port is so important.  Again, what is getting into your mind, Lenovo Designer.  I was expecting at least 4 USB ports.I will be laughing at you if you are holding a X240.  I only hope Lenovo makes X250 RIGHT, otherwise, it will be our last X series laptop for many of power users.In a word, go look for a used X230 and you would be better off than a new X240.

I have owned m7 x240 for a week and am returning it, after waiting for three weeks to receive it.  Worst piece of junk I have ever owned.  Enormous quality issues all the way from keyboard errors  (if you type a \"b\", you get a \"bt\" and then the backspace is disabled so you can't get rid of the error. ),  System goes to sleep and required a reboot to wake up.  This is a known error and requires a system update even in new machines, but in my case, no amount of updating, refreshing, etc fixes the issue.  Moreover, the system randomly locks you out telling you that you have the wrong password, even though you don't.  I could go on.  What a total lemon.  Tech support is very polite, but unknowledgable, unhelpful,  and unempowered to do anything but consult their reference materials.  They exhibit a total refusal to allow you to talk to a supervisor, etc.  I am returning this system and will never, ever buy another Lenovo product.

(x240)", "Author": "Peter Slattery", "ReviewID": "RXGU8OSUQOHPS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As someone who has owned several laptops (four), I have some idea of what to expect from them (they work with occasional issues, or get repaired under warranty)I have also had the good fortune to have purchased different brands, and experienced interactions with several laptop suppliers. In this regard I have found that they tend to provide an agreed product and service.As a result, I am a little suprised that my purchase from Lenovo (allegedly the number one seller of laptops) deviates from these general rules.Mid February, I buy the laptop. It takes a month to arrive (not expected). I replace the hard drive with a new samsung SSD (which I am allowed to do and retain my warranty). I install all my programs, then the SSD breaks and starts failing the SMART hard drive test. I replace it and get a refund. I reinstall everything, then the new hard drive fails again (I actually did five installs in total over the process of the two failures).I ring customer support. I am told that if I send in the computer with the ssd in it, it will get replaced. I was very clear that the SSD was not one that came with it (I pretty much ranted about the above issue to them so they were very clear that two new SSDs had failed in the computer, after going in with no issues detected). I clarify several times that I am sending in a hard drive that is not the one that came with it, and ask what is going to happen, e.g., are they really going to replace it. I am pleased to hear that they are going to replace the hard drive with one that matches what I send in. I assume this is because their laptop appears to have a faulty motherboard or something breaking the hard drives that I put in.I send in my laptop (three months after I purchased it, and having yet to use it). I feel that I will finally have the working laptop that I have needed since I purchased it. I get a call today telling me that (i) they will need to quote me a price for a new hard drive and (ii) they cannot return the hard drive I sent in (worth $150). If I want a refund, I will need the laptop send back, and to start a new process. This basically means I will either pay $300 (I don't get refund for old ssd and buy a new hard drive from lenovo or get my laptop back again, and then have to send it to them again).As I am so busy (finishing a PhD and tutoring) I am probably going to just pay. I am promised the quote by the end of the day, but I don't get it.Based on the above experience (the worst purchase I have ever made!) I would advise anyone thinking of buying from lenovo to rethink doing so.

I had one of our computer experts at my 400 employee workplace help me set it up.

He tried all sorts of things to figure the problem out and indicates that everything on this machine runs slow .. slow updating, and finally never able to shutdown.

I'm not sure but its so light I could just grab it like a note taking book or a tablet. It reminded me of the sony vaio z from 2012 because of how they both feel similar and have lots of power.- Display - Although the one I got had a 1366x768 ips display its beautiful, amazing viewing angles, and its matte finish helps outdoor use. When the FHD option comes out I recommend that!- fingerprint reader - responsive and works well compared to all the failed ones by HP- speedy - SSD samsung evo 840 - installed in and it runs so fast, intel i5-4300u is enough cpu power in my opinion for business use.- Battery - 2 3 cells - 9 hours of use and I can use power bridge to switch it while at work so my laptop doesn't even need to go off neat feature.Cons -one Ram slot - this is 2014 and the previous two models were able to hit 16gb, this feels like a downgrade :///resolution - The display is a pro but the resolution is too low but yeah get the FHD version when amazon releases it.Overall I am satisfy with the product I'll update the review when I use it for over a week and the touchpad I cannot grade yet because I want to see how it feels like in a week. But however its well made even though the trackpoint buttons are now integrated.  Also touchscreen is a waste of money in my opinion for business users.", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,329.00", "Features": "12.5\" HD (1366 x 768) TFT color, anti-glare,
