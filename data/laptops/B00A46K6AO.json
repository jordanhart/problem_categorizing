Don't expect powerhouse performance here", "Author": "Andrew Brandt", "ReviewID": "R329CO7Q99UFAM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a very basic, low-level laptop. It's not necessarily bad, it's just not that great either. Loads slow, video buffers a lot and system stutters when browsing through panels in the W8 modern UI. Perhaps with a little more RAM it might run faster, but I don't want to have to upgrade a laptop right out of the box. If money is an issue, this will work, but you can probably find something perhaps $50 more that may be a bit better out of the box.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Far So good", "Author": "Charketa T.

I purchased this laptop (toshiba satellite c855-ds5357) around November of 2012 - I am SHOCKED at how slowly it processes. I don't have it bogged down. I can have only one window open, but videos lag and look choppy. It takes me an hour to process a Fed Ex print order that used to take me only 5-10 minutes because page changes are S-l-O-W. Customer support was a joke - they told me 2 months ago that I didn't have a warranty. It was supposed to come with a 1 year - couldn't understand their CS Rep but I knew he was trying to sell me more stuff that I didn't need.  What I needed was a reliable computer that did what it was supposed to.It's pretty - but it's garbage.Run away folks. Bad news in Toshiba land.", "Date": "May 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, Bad, Good.", "Author": "F.
