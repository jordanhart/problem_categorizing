This great looking (white) laptop never crashes or freeze. And remember when it comes to Apple laptop, they don't get virus somehow. Just for these reason it's worth to own a apple ibook to me.

The system won't boot, or will boot and immediately freeze, or will freeze after a few minutes.  Many times, the machine will boot, but the display will be all black, all white, covered in stripes, or any of a zillion other display problems.  Some people \"live with\" the problem byactually clamping a C clamp onto the case in just the right spot to putpressure on the chip inside, which keeps it in contact with the board.Some people open the case and wedge pieces of paper on top of the chip, so that when the case is closed, they press on the chip to keep all the pins in contact.  But this is pretty dicey.The problem was faulty soldering on a ball grid array (BGA) chip on the motherboard.  In my case, I knew this going in, and sent the machine out toa repair services that specializes in this repair.  They disassemble the machine, and re-solder the BGA.  It's been trouble-free for 2 years and still going strong since I had that repair done.Search the web for \"iBook G3 BGA defect\"  and you'll find all you need to know about this issue.  You can find many places that can fix this for $50 - $75, plus shipping.  Just expect to have to do this, and build that into your total cost if you buy one of these.ALSO - these machines are now far too slow to play YouTube videos (or most on-line video of any kind).  Just be aware of that, if that is important to you.  When I bought it 2 years ago, it played YouTube fine, but YouTube and most on-line video continues to get more and more processor-intensive, so now a processor this slow cannot handle it.", "Date": "July 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not worth the money I paid.

Michelli", "ReviewID": "R3U2ZMM1754X2D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this computer for my 10 year old daughter for Christmas.  It is the perfect first computer for her age group.  The parental controls on a Mac are exactly what a parent would want.  My daughter can not go on any website unless I have created a shortcut button for it in her favorites bar.  I was able to decide what applications she is allowed to use and I set up network sharing between my computer and hers.It doesn't have the latest and greatest of everything on it but for my 10 year old it has everything she could ever want.  She will probably use this as her primary computer for the next 5 years and at less than $200, that makes it an awesome investment.Plus, with it being a Mac, it will continue to last as an extra laptop for my family forever!  I still have a G3 desktop Mac that I have been using for photography work since 1998 and I have never had a problem with it.  I trust Apple computers with my life and I would never buy any other computer brand.", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "This company went above and beyond", "Author": "R.Sojka", "ReviewID": "R3HEWA26NSRXZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son loves his first lapbook and I am so grateful for the outstanding customer service  and the low price and awesome clean computer", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "GREAT DEAL!!!", "Author": "Ryan Bacich", "ReviewID": "R16GXZ5NI5RTZK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop with a great deal!!!!
