It was the cheapest system with a screen resolution better than 1366x7682. I did not plan on lugging it around in a backpack on a regular basisThus far it has performed well at all intended tasks:1. Interface computer for finish-line camera and timing at track meets (high resolution screen really helps)2. CPU-driven media player that interfaces with a bio-feedback USB system (movies fade out when bio-feedback is negative, movies play normally when bio-feedback is positive)3. Output media via HDMI to my media center for websites that do not have an app on my WDTV LiveThe Pentium 3550M has handled everything we've thrown at it so far with ease (after implementing the software recommendations below). It is an excellent general-use system.Software recommendations:1. Disable the Lenovo system monitoring features. This thing sucks up resources attempting to track and report how the system is being used. Win 8 has excellent system monitoring tools that don't kill performance.2. Remove McAfee and use a different security suite. McAfee brought the whole system to a crawl and will not yield resources to basic, non-dangerous OS usage. Norton Internet Security works fine without making the system unusable.Other notes:1. I added a 4-GB memory stick to bring the total memory to 8-GB2. Even with the mechanical HDD I am happy with the boot up and program load times. However, I do not turn this computer on/off many times a day.3. Windows 8 - if you haven't used it yet expect to waste a few hours figuring out how to do tasks you have taken for granted since 2001 (WinXP)4. Good bags for 17,3\" laptops tend to cost more than 16\" and smaller laptops. I got lucky and found a rolling bag on sale at a local store for half a Franklin, but many of them available locally and online cost a whole Franklin or more.5. It takes some time to get used to the numpad on a laptop. My right hand automatically moves to the right edge of the keyboard. I wish there was a visual separator between the main keyboard and the numpad such as a gray or silver line.6. Intel HDMI drivers, including the ones included with this system, are a bit flaky when sync'ing to a home receiver. They do not properly detect the display settings for my TV through the receiver. To get around this:  (1) attach computer to receiver, if not displaying properly on TV,  (2) attach computer directly to TV, make sure display settings are correct,  (3) attach computer to receiver, and voila!  These steps have worked for me on many systems with Intel CPU", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this! !", "Author": "ashlwat84", "ReviewID": "R2M8ZABU5R244F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my dream computer!!

There's one time I literally tried 10min to shut down the PC but failed. common, my 4 years old PC works a million times better than it does!  I didn't expect too much on this PC at first considering its price and it's just used to read PDF anyway, but still...... I didn't know it would drive me crazy even what i want is just turning the pages. About the appearance and display screen, it's just OK. so if u're OK with carrying a mouse wherever u go, and 10 min for shutting it down, congrats, it's OK for u.", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$469.99", "Features": "Intel Pentium Dual-Core 3550M 2.3 GHz Processor\n4 GB DDR3 RAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n17.3-Inch Screen\nWindows 8.1; 5-Hour Battery Life", "Name": "Lenovo IdeaPad G710 17.3-Inch Laptop (59410273) Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51k%2BgO1TEqL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HIYA3WQ"}}
