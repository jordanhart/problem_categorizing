It's battery life is about 4 hours at 80%(set at that to preserve battery life), the graphics are great, and the sound is LOUD, but it does sound kind of tinny(no bass, duh). It comes with a Plants vs. Zombies trial, and a shark dash full version. The laptop plays Star Wars Battlefront 2 on it, so you know it has good speed. It plays it without delay, and is very fast. On all the other computers the internet is slow, but on this thing for some reason it is very fast. Now for the problem that most users are afraid of: Windows 8. It really isn't that bad. I am not the I-phone kind of person, so I disregard most of the stuff on it. Basically what it is is an app menu that you can put what you want on it(like installed games, or Google chrome, which, by the way, doesn't come with it), and have ease of access to things like S-Player(aka, a twisted version of windows media player), and the internet. The only problem I have with this computer is the touch pad. It is unresponsive to the scroll feature(two fingers in a direction), so you may have to buy a mouse for this computer. Luckily, I already had one so this wasn't an issue. I would recommend this laptop to anyone, because it is a masterpiece of laptops. Save your money on a big expensive one, and buy this one!", "Date": "May 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "The perfect 17\"", "Author": "Tojued", "ReviewID": "R1Q8IVWIPKSYW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop is not as gigantic as i expected it to be, maybe i've gotten used to the screensize.The battery life is decent, i live in a country with regular blackouts and this battery serves me well.Once you get used to windows 8, it totally rocks. You can pinch to zoom with the mousepad of this laptop.Consider buying a remote mouse. Right now i use my phone as a remote.The sound is powerful.What i hate: the regular solitaire etc are missing. pinball 3D is the only full game that comes with the system. I don't mind buying games, but data connection's very expensive where i live.I needed a large screen for games, movies and pattern-making software. For less than $500, this baby is a dream come true.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "good buy", "Author": "laura", "ReviewID": "R24G1POA2OZTRY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nice blue steel looking cover ,vary thin ,super fast loads up quick storage for a lot of stuff,should last for years", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "looks great", "Author": "Eriks Troms", "ReviewID": "R3KDXO06XHELH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good buy fast good storage size loads up quick looks great steel blue thin not as thick as older one I  have should last for years", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00AA15WQQ"}}
