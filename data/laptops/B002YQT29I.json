It is a tough, well constructed latop that is great for everyday work. The video card which seperated this model from other Dells of its time is very good and better than most stock videos on new laptops.", "Date": "March 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "An Excellent Purchase", "Author": "Illyich", "ReviewID": "RFAGKQ7VWXJDO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer was purchased to replace a newer machine the had failed and has been a fine replacement. After adding the battery that the seller said was missing I have been very pleased with the performance of it. Though it is a used machine, it was in nearly new condition and has worked well, even accepting a 2GB memory upgrade from the failed machine it replaced. with that addition it has been able to run Windows 7 without fault. This is how a purchase should be, honest and easy. If this seller has another machine offered, buy it, you can't go wrong.", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazon, a good used computer purchase", "Author": "david schaedler", "ReviewID": "R2X9IGKOQXF0R0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A computer is a computer, and this one matches that expectation.

So I took a two day computer class and  I found out that you need windows to use Microsoft word. This computer used to use Windows XP but that is obsolete so they changed it to Ubuntu, so it doesn't use the most common system.  When I tried to use it the battery was dead and would't take a charge. So I bought another battery, but they don't make new ones anymore so it was shot too. I'm sorry I bought it.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Dell M70 computer", "Author": "Dorothy Walton", "ReviewID": "R1CATNKQ3EN90X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Dell computer was returned because none of the components worked.
