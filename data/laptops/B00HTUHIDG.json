I know exactly why you're here and what you need.You're here because you are looking for a great notebook that will not hurt your wallet.You're curious to find out how far your  hard earned $300 investment can get you.NOT VERY FAR  and this particular Satellite equipped with AMD E series processor it wont get you anywhere at all.Im writing to you because I would like to save you from your own curiosity and hopes in making this laptop work for you only due to its attractive price.  But don't let the price alone blind you from one fact.1) This AMD E series cannot handle even the most basic functions one needs from a computer.  IMO manufacture's should not even consider releasing such a slow Processor, risking their brand's image.PROS:  4 GB,  battery life, price.CONS:  (AMD E) the processor is too slow to run Windows 8, let alone browse or stream internet.  This CON cancels out all the pros above.But there's a good news for us value shoppers.  There are other options near $300-$400 price range that can deliver you the value and uncompromising performance.  There are just a  few pointers I'd like to mention before I completely lose your attention.No matter how much money you are planning to save, this simple advice in parts will save you much headaches.A) Look for noteboooks with an AMD A-6, A-8 or A-10 Processors or  an Intel Pentium Haswell 4thgeneration or Intel i3.B) Look for 4GB RAM to 6GB RAM.  Do not settle for 2GB, unless you are capable of DIY memory upgrade.C) TouchscreenD) Avoid 3rd Party sellers if possible. Buy directly from Amazon.But if you're like me who will not be swayed away from our set budget then take a look at this new released notebook by Asus.  Its features an Intel Celeron that was just announced to the market 3 months ago and was set to release early 2014.  I believe this is one of the first notebooks in amazon with this new Celeron for budget consumers.  Honestly I cant comment on how fast it is because its so new that benchmarks websites hasn't tested any notebooks with this CPU but rest assured that its better than the AMD E-1 inside the Toshiba above.ASUS D550MA-DS01 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black )  this is similar in price but 33% faster. if you don't believe me , research it yourself at passmark bench stats.(pls thumbs up, I put a lot of hours making compiling this review. ty:-)==CONTENTS==1) Alternative Options2) TOP 3  ($280-$399)-(11.6\"-14\"Touch between (3.7-2.6 lbs)3) TOP 2  ($399 - $499)-(14\"Touch between (4.7lbs-5.6lbs)4) TOP 2  ($500-$800)-(15\"Touch between (4.8 Ibs - 5.6 lbs or higher)5) Windows 8.1 Tips & Computing Safety between==Alternative Options==I was doing my research my goal was to find the value laptop without hurting my wallet,  I continue to update and filter through the entire amazon laptop list!

An \"Administrators\" account is a backdoor route viruses/malware uses get in and cause unrecoverable distruction to your data. With Admin rights those malware can easily infect deep within your \"recovery partitions'! meaning, these's not turning back and you're royally screwed. Theres many more problems that can happen but I think you already get my point.GOALS: 1) Don't use your Main MS Account as an\" Adminitrator\" but instead \"standard\"  2) Create a secondary account called \"local account\" and set that up as the Administrator instead.Account Management: steps creating a local account(administrator) and MS Account(standard)Charms search: type\"control panel\" > \"User's Accounts and Family Safety\" > \"Remove User account\" > \" Add a new user in PC settings \" located at bottom of window > Bringing you to Metro > click \"add Account\" > \"Sign in without MS accout\" located at bottom of page > \"Local Accout\" > create new user name and PWYou have 2 options on Signing IN1) Microsoft account or 2) Local Account1) Create or sign in with your MAIN Microsoft Account. If you already an MS account or uses windows phones/ xbox live or Hotmail/live/MSN email address you can use these as well to link those services to 1 master MS Account.2) Create a Local Account. Thise secondary account will not connect to MS's ecosytem but only in your local computer. I identical to USERS login on Windows 7,Vista,XP etc.Once you've setup these two accounts, you must set each account type to: >Change ACCOUNT TYPE for Main MS Account to \"Standard\"Change ACCOUNT TYPE for 2ndary Local Account to \"Administrator\"Please do these steps, it only takes 5minutes.  Its a small price to pay considering, it may  potentially rescue your entire data from a completely erasing your data after sending it for repairs.__________________________________________________________________________Making Back ups/ EtcAnother tip is to make a recovery image.First install Setup all your programs , setup your custom settings, etcAfter personalizing your PC.  > Its time to Create a Recovery Image right after you've set everything up.  This image will allow you to revert back to this pc's state in time, and in perfect working order.Sometimes system recovery doesn't solve your problems so having secondary backup plan like Recovery Image is key.________________________________________________________________________Not optional, must practice these 3 regular computing habits.#1  (Install AVG/free) or  Kaspersky Internet Security 2014  is the leading software in the market today at $50 or Norton.  These Antivirus' are categorized as: Preventor and a Remover.#2  (Install MalwareBytes/free) Is the best software in removing infected systems. This is the best in the business and its FREE! scan your pc every month with this program or whenever you expeirience dramatic system slowdown/sluggish or seeing your browser redirect you to different sites on its own, to obvious signs like, your bank account has been compromized)  Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the autoprotect and autoscan scheduler feature. MalwareBytes(free) is categorized as a Remover not a Preventor.#3  (Install Superantispyware/free, Scan pc every 2wks)SuperAntiSpyware SAS; often cleans up tracking cookies.Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the the autoprotect and autoscan scheduler feature. SuperAntiSpyware is categorized as - Remover not a Preventor.#4 (Install SpywareBlaster/Free)A popular choice  Unlike other programs. SpywareBlaster does not have to remain running in the backroound inorder to do its job.  SpywareBlaster is categorized as a Preventor not a Remover.Its ok skip a few scans between months, although not advisable, especially if your a heavy web surfing maniac spending 2-3 hrs daily websurfing.  But please dont go without using at least 1 Remover program on the list more than 2-4 Months in between scans.Furthermore i'd like to discuss the misconceptions regarding the built-in security solution in Windows 8, called Windows Defender. Windows Defender is definitely not sufficient to protect typical home users during a period of what is considered a renaissance like advancement in black technical field of  melicious software development.  If you think or belive those \"techsavy\" people, thinking windows defender is enough, you're clueless. But I also believe Windows Defender on Windows 8 is a very very strong product.________________________________________________________________________Another way to avoid  spreading your personal information out there into the wild unknowingly is to un-google yourself.yes ladies and gents! google or yahoo especially yahoo LOL..... but google is key here.Microsoft sells Primarily Software.Apple sells Primarily HardwareGoogle sells neither, that's why their products are so CHEAP, once they suckered in their backdoor ridden ecosystem, Google Inc. sells Primarily Everything about YOU!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Steps in upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1  (2-3hrs)Key here is to ensure your windows 8 is fully updated before upgrading to win8.1Therefore repeatedly \"check of updates\" on windowsHow to upgrade to windows 8.1 for dummies.Step 1: Go to Metro and not desktopStep 2: Start typing : \"Control Panel\"Step 3: Click \"Windows Update\" > \"Check for Update\"Step 4: install updatesStep 5: restart computerStep 6: Repeat step 1 -5 until result \"no more updates\"Step 7: Run HP Update client, install all updates from HP to ensure all drivers and bugfixes are updated.( or whichever OEM you may have, lenovo,dell, sony etc.)Step 8: Uninstall your Antivirus Software (important) then RESTART PCStep 9: Go to Windows Store and upgrade to 8.1Step 10: leave computer on for 2hrs as it upgrades.Step 11: Repeat Steps 1 - 7Step 12: if you're not a complete fool, 8.1 upgrade should be straight forward. \\After steps 1-8 ONLY THEN you should install WIndows 8.1 at the marketplace. Goodluck.(note: steps above removes a lot of failures users experience after 8.1 update)___________________________________________________________Not many want to shell out their dollars on Office 360  if all they intend of using is standard word processors.you can use a free web version of office calledBing.com search:  \"MS Office Web Apps\"just sign in with the same  MS Account user name used on your PC.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "No blemish Review Here!", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R1OHH9SJFZPJHJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is easy to see why a reviewer HAD to spent SO much time (hour)s writing a review.I could write this review in seconds...Computer starts up in less than a minute.

Best case scenario, you might get 6-12 months out of your laptop before things start to fail. Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba.
