The seller sent it with an fraudulent Windows 7 OS.  Would not recommend purchasing from this seller.  Took 2 days, and several hours on the phone with both Dell and Microsoft to resolve the situation.  The last technician that I spoke to finally diagnosed the problem.....a fraudulent Windows 7 OS, he determined that as the Product Key was unusable, plus I kept getting a message that I could be a victim of fraud.  Microsoft finally sent me a legal copy of WIndows 7 OS.  The Dell technician told me he was going to report the seller to Microsoft, as I did too.  I also complained to Amazon, and recommended this seller be removed from their site.  TigerDirect was NOT the seller of this item...just wanted to make that clear.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "totally happy!", "Author": "D. henry", "ReviewID": "R1VQRVNW61C2YC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "got this to replace our 6 year old Dell Studio 17 that was starting to get pretty tired.  This i17R is very nice.  The 8G Ram is fantastic and really has improved the performance over the 4G ram that our old studio 17 had.  good screen.  Boots quickly.  Keyboard is just a little mushy, but not an issue.I would have given it 5 stars, BUT IT NEEDS A BACK LIGHTED KEYBOARD.  That is my only complaint. However, I am very pleased with this machine!! We saved money and sales tax by getting it on amazon (saved about $100 over buying it locally at walmart here in Peoria, IL)  Win, Win!!!Update: 6 months later: The keyboard has always had an issue with the (\") quote key.  It does not place the \" on the keyboard until after you type it & then have to hit the space key.  I should request customer support, but too lazy to mess with dell customer support for such a small issue.  Other than that, computer working fine.  Still wish the keyboard was back light.Good Luck!

The computer itself is worthy of 5 stars. It's fast and powerful, with an excellent screen and keyboard. The build quality is very good. If you get a good sample, it's probably one of the best laptops you could buy, and it's a great value at the price.However, if you get one which doesn't work properly in any respect, think very carefully about whether you want to try working with Dell  customer support or Dell technical support. The first sample of the 17S Special Edition I received was badly flawed. It couldn't do backups larger than a few megabytes (yes, that's megabytes, not gigabytes) and it would not play many of the online videos (YouTube, Vimeo) I was used to playing on my other computers. Over the next *SIX WEEKS*, I spent dozens of hours \"on hold\" and trying to work with Dell tech reps to solve these problems. The reps actually made the computer's problems much worse. \u00d6ne \"senior rep\" tried to tell me this was \"a software problem\" and therefore Dell was not obligated to help with it. Eventually a friend who is an IT person for a local firm confirmed my suspicion that the computer's hard drive was fatally flawed. Two different Dell senior tech reps denied my request to return the computer for replacement, or for refund. After a lot of prodding and patience on my part, Dell eventually agreed to send a replacement.I do want to say that there were two Dell reps, one a very junior tech rep and the other a senior support rep, who were wonderful. The junior rep stayed with me throughout the long and very frustrating process, and the final senior rep was a model of what a good support rep should be. Both of them returned phone calls, and both phoned me to report progress even when I hadn't asked for phone calls. So not all Dell tech or support people are ineffective.*===>The replacement laptop was quick and easy to set up, and it has worked just as it should work, \"right out of the box\". I love it. Again - this is a computer worthy of a 5 star rating. But be very careful if you need to work with Dell technical people.If anyone's interested in more details, I've left part of my original review below the asterisks. There's a lot more to this tale than I related in that review. If anyone wants more details, communicate with me privately and I'll supply them.****************************************************************************[from the original review]..... But it has some bugs which make it almost unuseable. I use computers for photo and video editing and storage, so frequent backups of data are essential. I've never had trouble making backups of computer data before this computer. But none of the three backup programs I've tried, including Windows Backup, Acronis True Image, and Handybackup, will make a backup on this laptop. Also, it cannot view or play about half of the online videos I try to access. On four (yes, four!) occasions, I've spent hours on the phone with Dell tech reps, shuttled back and forth to different phone numbers with lengthy periods \"on hold\" - three solid hours on the phone this morning alone -  but I have not received any useful help from the Dell telephone support personell. A rep from the Dell online \"chat\" support claimed that the factory installation of Windows 7 is the problem. She said she would have Dell send a Windows disc.....so I'll need to wipe my HD clean, do a clean installation of Windows, and hope that helps. However, there are no guarantees even then.[Added Dec 11, 2012 - the OEM Windows 7 disc from Dell did not help. The disc would not recognize the computer's hard drive! My friend the IT person confirmed that this was an unsolveable problem. Possibly it could have been resolved if I bought and installed a new HD, but then would the videos have played as they should have?]", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "One happy camper", "Author": "Happy Camper", "ReviewID": "R1SYC5O5VMWQXY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop does everything I could possibly need at lightning speed.
