The Asus laptop is a really good deal for the price. There are a few drawbacks that I am listing below, but overall I am very satisfied with the laptop performance. I ordered the laptop with an additional 4 Gb of memory. I used Minitool Partition Wizard Home Edition (free version) to delete the D: partition and extend the C: partition to the full drive. So far CPU performance is very good and I have never used more than 25% of the 8 Gb of memory even running CAD programs. The laptop is also very cool and have only noticed that the power supply gets a little warm when running intensive disk utilities. Overall I am very pleased with the laptop.PROs:Great display resolutionGood Key size on the keyboard while still including a numeric keypadRuns coolGood priceCPU and disk size is great for the priceCons:Soft and thin case top - could be easy to damage the displaySpeakers and not that good...full volume is not that loud", "Date": "September 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Amazing Laptop", "Author": "JohnRiver", "ReviewID": "R2NKPM2PHULGH2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop for its price.Pros: Excellent specs (RAM, Hard Drive, Video Card), it comes with one 3.0 USB, decent material quality, light, price, amazing heat control (never gets  hot), not prone to get fingerprints, perfect screen size, decent resolution, solid keyboard.Cons: battery life it is not the best, speakers are NOT loud at all. Sometimes problems reading the disc unit... could be a software issue, touchpad not the best.I purchased this laptop because its specs and price. I have to admit this is not the most beautiful laptop you are going to find... but that is not important to me. I use this laptop for work and for gaming and I am completely satisfy with its performance so far. I highly recommend to purchase this laptop with the extra 4 GB  of RAM.Now here it is a list of games I have tested and next you will see the graphics quality I could get.* Command and Conquer 3 - Full graphics* FIFA 2013 - Full graphics* Fallout New Vegas - Full graphics* Trine 2 - Full graphics* Call of duty 4 - Full graphics* Dishonored - Full graphics* Transcripted - Full graphics* Left 4 dead - Full graphics* Dirt 2 - Medium graphics (still look very good)I know the majority of the games are not the newest but they required a decent video card. You can overclock your APU (CPU and GPU together) A6 VISION and this will increase you clock speed but I haven't done it yet ( if you don't know how to do it correctly don't do it)... if you want to determine whether this  laptop is a gaming laptop or not  that's your choice.During my job I use the laptop with programs like excel, photoshop, dreamweaver and other programs  and it can handle all of them at the  same time with NOT lagging nor heat at all.I've been using the laptop for a month.... No problems so far.If you are looking for a cheap laptop with great built quality and excellent performance(decent gaming, office and adobe CS5 - perfectly) this is your choice.

I have to say this laptop is simply amazing for the price/feature set. The only thing I would recommend is upgrading the RAM from 4 GB to 8 GB for that little extra kick since the drive is a tad slow (to be expected on a laptop). My son has been doing some mid range gaming (minecraft/tf2/civ) on it as well as word processing (school) and web browsing (facebook/gaming sites) and for that this system fits perfectly.The amount of garbage-ware on the system is minimal for this price point and all of it uninstalled quickly and without complication and for that I have to thank ASUS. This laptop shipped and worked perfectly out of the box; it appears to have a different power supply than the previous one so that may have been the problem and was already resolved so a pass to ASUS on that.All and all I am pleased with ASUS and Amazon in this transaction and would recommend this system to those looking to do a bit of everything on a budget.original: I expected a basic system with little frills but what I got was a system that would not power on. I am disappointed in ASUS Quality Control but I will give them another shot to get it right. I will update this review once I receive the replacement accordingly.Amazon was amazing as usual; overnight delivery on the original arrived as scheduled and the exchange was processed immediately and the replacement laptop was shipped before they received the package. Amazon was also rad enough to send the replacement part overnight as well in the fashion in which I originally ordered.

Thankfully, Amazon has a great return policy and they are shipping out a replacement in short order. But still, it gives me a reason for concern about this company's quality control, the screen was totally dead on arrival. All the manufacturer wanted to do for me is send it back to them and wait 14 days to hear what they had decided to do about it, not cool at all for a totally dead LCD screen on day one. Make up your own mind about this, for me I am willing to give them one more try, mainly because the other reviews sound great.Am I doing this because I have been in the computer field since 1980 and have seen a lot of bugs in both the software and hardware side and am more tolerant?

As far as specs go, my colleagues say this machine has some real robust features, in example, being 64 bit. For me, it was just a pleasure to have a \"starter\" package of Microsoft Word and Excel already installed. I write a lot and have found these to be adequate. The keyboard is also decent, though I really have no use for the number pad and wish that instead more effort had been put into light-up keys or a more \"mac-like\" feel, but ultimately this is trivial. The speakers are also not wonderful, but it is a laptop and I don't expect much in this category. The battery life is great though. And the screen is vibrant.Thus far, everything has run smoothly, looked great, and been a major improvement over its ancient predecessor. I don't play games, so this review should not be considered if you are heavily into such. For me, this piece of equipment has been just what I wanted -- I'm not very demanding but I'm certain it could handle more - and the price was fantastic.If you are realistic about you actually do with your laptop, what your needs really are, then this ASUS is probably a great deal for most everyday users.Enjoy.", "Date": "November 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad spacebar", "Author": "K.

Good specs but there are a few flaws that I did not see others point out. The first thing I did was do a clean install of Windows 7. I then installed a few essential programs (i.e. browser, antivirus, etc), at this point the system was quite bare, yet I still experienced hiccups in performance here and there. For a machine with 4GB of ram (and hardly any programs installed) I did not expect the machine to lag when doing simple tasks such as opening two internet browsers. Needless to say, this was disappointing so now I'm considering upgrading the ram sticks.Many people mentioned this but in case you're wondering, yes the plastic case does feel cheap. In fact I heard a small crack when I flipped the laptop upside down to copy the windows key. I was not using force or anything, I am actually quite careful when handling electronics. The good news is nothing seemed to have broke.Note that you won't be able to tell if your laptop is finished charging once you power the machine off. Why? You ask? Because ASUS failed to make the battery light blink while charging. This might not be a big deal for some of you but I would like to know when my battery is finished charging. As some of you may know, constantly overcharging a laptop battery is a great way to kill it. Anyway the battery light stays completely solid when the AC adapter is plugged in, so you'll have to keep tabs on the battery yourself. I'm still amazed how ASUS left out that feature. Even my 11 year old laptop has a blinking charge light, not this one though.Other than that the laptop has been pretty good. Resting on a heatshift pad I have not seen it go over 47C. The intake vents are placed on a curve between the bottom casing and the palm rest so they are never blocked, this is an A+ in my book. Speaking of the palm rest it doesn't warm up until ~43C, which is good enough for me.I love that there is a USB 3.0 port. I purchased a USB 3.0 flash drive when I bought my desktop but didn't use it much because the 3.0 ports were in the back. It was too much of a hassle to reach over to the rear ports each time. I'm glad I can finally take advantage of the speed now!The right and left click buttons are very responsive and do not require much force unlike some laptops. The keyboard is awesome, it feels very solid and soft to the touch, if the 10 keys weren't so squished it would have been perfect. My issue is that the arrow keys and number keys feel a little awkward with no spacing between them. I've gotten the keys mixed up a few times because they are right next to each other. Regardless, the keyboard and buttons feel great.Bottom line: if you're okay with a laptop that has cheap plastic case and quality specs then this laptop is for you.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nothing special, does what it does.", "Author": "Lynn", "ReviewID": "RPWLVP97PJKT0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife needed a new computer and this definitely fit the price range.  It is definitely a bit bulky, but overall feels much lighter than the old Dell 15\" laptop she had mostly due to the battery being much smaller in the ASUS.  When we took it out of the packaging the mouse touchpad did not work, I had to plug in an external mouse to finish the windows set-up and called tech support who tried some rudimentary troubleshooting and eventually said I would have to send the computer to them for repair.  I was a little upset, but the ASUS tech support personnel were friendly and easy to work with, they also paid for shipping both ways, I just had to print out a piece of paper and take it to a FEDEX drop-off location.  The total time from when the computer was sent in until we received it back was around a week and a half and it seems like they have fixed the issue.

What made me decide on this, besides the great price and good sped, was the horrible customer service reviews for Toshiba. I guess we had never had any issues with any of ours, so there was never a reason to speak with them. All I can say is my daughter was so estactic when she opened the box on Christmas, she asked, is this really a laptop, or did you wrap something in a laptop box, lol, as we often wrapped things in other boxes, this computer came with a one year \"bumper to bumper\" warranty, as I like to say, protecting it from spills, drops, everything, and with a 16 year old you need that. They give you 60 days to set up the warranty, but it's effective from the date of purchase, so that's a bummer since I bought it in November and didn't do the warranty until mid-January.

Fast forward 7 months and the plastic that holds the hinges to the case are cracked and one of the hinges isn't being held down at all (this is a very well known problem with the model).  I decide to do a quick fix and JB weld it down and sell it after doing research on a newer laptop.  I came to the conclusion the ASUS A53Z was the right one for my price range.  I bought it brand new.When I received it the case felt very sturdy and everything worked great.  A month into ownership one of the hinges starts clicking and getting stuck.  I don't think too much of it, maybe it just needs more lubrication.  After 2 months I open the case up and to my dismay the plastic holding the clicking hinge down is broken on one lower spot and the top plastic as well and the top plastic on the other hinge.  I couldn't believe that the same thing happened to my new laptop in less time, which was the reason I sold my old one...  These manufacturers just set the screen hinges way too stiff and the plastic holding the metal hinges in place can't take the strain.  I don't open my screen in any abnormal way BTW.  I decided to just JB weld the plastic back together and reinforce the parts that haven't broken yet, then loosen the hinges so that it will hold up on it's own but put less strain on the plastic.  I could send it in for warranty, but I'd be without a laptop for an undetermined amount of time, and even then the case plastic will likely break again.All I can say is my next laptop will be made of metal...

The computer is not bad. I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't see much of a speed improvement over the Acer laptop I bought two years ago, but it's a little better. The ergonomics are ok. The arrow buttons and number pad are laid out a little strange and take some getting used to, I'm still not great with the small number pad but I'm getting better with practice. The keyboard takes some getting used to as the buttons seem just a tad off to the left and I'm still not up to full typing speed (oh and the enter button is already sticking a bit, this pc is only a few months old!). My biggest complaint is that I record a podcast and I bought this mostly to make recordings. The sound chip in this is terrible, and after searching around I've found a lot of other people with similar RealTek issues. Playback is fine but attempting to do any input gets wonky very quickly. The ports don't recognize that things are plugged or unplugged properly. I contacted Asus and their initial solution was to reformat and reinstall Windows. Again after reading of other folks having the same issues I determined that wasn't likely to help so I just spent 34 bucks on an external usb sound card. I just got it today but it seems to be working fine. Another bit of trouble I've had is the ethernet port doesn't seem to function properly. I went to setup an Asus wifi router which has you plug the router into the pc for setup. The router would never read as functional through the ethernet port on this computer. Luckily, I still have the Acer sitting around and used it's ethernet port to complete the router setup. I would have continued using the Acer but the video card got a bit screwy upon lightning hitting the house, and I needed a new computer with a properly working monitor quickly. Overall the size and weight are ok and battery life is good. This one vents out the side which I can't tell if I like or not. My Acer vents out the back causing my legs to get very hot and while this is a bit nicer it also often blows straight onto the power cord, which seems bad to me though it may never cause any problems. The cool wrist rest feature really seems to work, so that is good. The monitor is just ok, the viewing angles aren't great, but that's kinda what you get with a laptop. The trackpad is nice and the buttons feel better than the Acer. I would hesitate to buy another Asus product after getting this laptop. I did just get a Nexus 7, built by Asus, that I really like, so who knows...

After my trusty Dell Studio laptop stopped working, I did a lot of research. I figured that since I don't do anything too sophisticated with my computer (no gaming, no heavy computations, no video editing or really even music playing), I could use something with just the basics. This computer had great ratings and seemed like a steal for the price, so I went with it. From the very beginning it was slow. I really only use my computer to surf the internet and type up documents for class, and it was slow with these very basic applications. One night, not even two months after purchase, I shut the computer down to finalize some updates (automatic Windows updates, mind you). Before shutting down it said it was applying the updates and not to turn it off. Standard. Except that it continued to do this for several hours, although the progress bar froze at 16%. Finally it powered itself off in the middle of the updates (even though it was plugged into the wall). When I attempted to reboot, it gave me a blue screen. It told me to uninstall the updates by booting into Safe Mode. Except that it wouldn't allow me to boot into Safe Mode. I tried booting from a Windows disc and from USB-- no luck. I passed it along to my friends in the computer science department and they couldn't fix it. It doesn't help that Asus's website is pretty terrible as well, and that you practically have to jump through hoops to access the information you need to. At one point I filled out a form with all my computer's information and the registration number on the bottom, pressed submit and the website changed entirely to an Asian language rather than giving me the page I wanted. I was in disbelief. I had registered the computer for warranty the very night it was delivered, but when I finally got in touch with an Asus rep through the website, he or she merely gave me some poor instructions to try to restore the operating system and said they could not replace it or offer a refund. At the same time, Amazon was telling me that I would need to have the computer serviced under warranty by Asus and they couldn't replace it. The entire thing was a mess. I am fairly certain that I received a defective unit (because the computer is so well-rated by others), but to me it is simply not worth the risk. In the event that you get a defective laptop, you will have to bend over backwards to send it back, will have to interface with Asus' horrible website, and will be told conflicting stories all along the way. Eventually Amazon took it back (but only because I had ordered it during the holidays and had an extended return window) and refunded it. Thank god.
