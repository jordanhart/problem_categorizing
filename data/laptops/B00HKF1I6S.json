{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Like", "Author": "Pen Name", "ReviewID": "R3060Q4RJ4KCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using for about two months an HP 2000-2d22dx which is of the same product line as this HP 2000-2d89nr here on Amazon. There is good non-touch-screen performance and an excellent touchpad. The maximum sound volume, though, is markedly low in the model I have.  In both this one now on Amazon and mine there is no number pad, just a large keyboard in the style of a 14 inch laptop.  Mine and this one have bright glossy screens and glossy black finishes for the case, both of which I like a lot. My model has plain Windows 8, and this one does too.  I like mine a lot aesthetically and functionally and I also guess I like Windows 8 about as much as I might like Windows 8.1.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$683.33", "Features": "Intel Core i5 3230M 2.6 GHz\n4 GB\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 8, 4.5-hour battery life", "Name": "HP 2000-2d89nr 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black Licorice)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Yg3NQ28wL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HKF1I6S"}}
