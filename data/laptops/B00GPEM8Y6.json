{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So happy with this purchase!", "Author": "Catalina", "ReviewID": "R32RDD5VTLXH8O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm from Colombia. I have a Dell Inspiron 1525 since February of 2008. Many people have had problems with that laptop, I'm not one of them. It still works and it's great but I wanted something with better specs because I really enjoy gaming and watching tv shows and movies with my laptop via hdmi.I started to research for a new laptop by December and this one really caught my attention. At first, I really liked another Ideapad model here in Amazon, so, then I went to Lenovo's website and found out that the prices there were better if you use eCoupons, and I could do a better comparison between IdeaPad's models. Then, I went to Lenovo's colombian website but this model in particular was nowhere to be found so I called a telephone number in Argentina but it went straight to the voice mail.So, I decided to take a chance and bought this laptop from Lenovo's american website (using Amazon payments) and got my stepmother to send it to me from US. I am really lucky that this item is covered by Lenovo's International Warranty.Let me tell you this, that was the best decision of my life!I bought it at December 27th. By January 10th it had arrived to my house, here! in Colombia! :DIt's been two days now and it's been an amazing experience. I'm in love with my new laptop. I'm the envy of all my friends and family. I think this model it's really stylish and unique. The screen is so sharp and the speakers are fantastic!!! Almost everyone I know has an overpriced Macbook, and I really don't like those, I'm a PC girl. This laptop also has greats specs for the price. Some people have complained about the weight of the laptop and the charger, let me tell you this, compared to my old Dell Inspiron, this is Air! Lol. That is a HEAVY laptop. This is nothing!!! Not even the charger. And trust me, I'm a skinny, fragile girl who needs to travel across the country all the time with my laptop in my backpack. For me, it really is lightweight, especially with that kind of specs.The only 2 things that I'm not really crazy about it, it's Windows 8.1 (I really hate it) and the american keyboard. I reconfigured it to be latin american keyboard, but, it's really confusing for me to write properly in Spanish. Using things like \u00f1 and ', for example. The icons are all messed up :(, but I was expecting both of those things when I purchased it so, I think, maybe, I just need time to get use to it.Overall, this laptop it's just what I wanted and even more. Go do yourself a favor and buy one of this, now!!!. It's the best price for a laptop that you can get!!.BTW, This is my first review, EVER!, that's how I like this product! I'm not really used to speak English so, I'm sorry if I made some mistakes. I hope you all have the same great experience that I have.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "FANTASTIC LAPTOP!!! Excellent Specs and a Powerhouse", "Author": "Alexander Knowles \"Monty\"", "ReviewID": "R2HXOLCVWJHGGJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop to replace my one year old ASUS A55VD-AB71 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black)I wanted a laptop that had GREAT SPEAKERS, full high definition screen resolution, a backlit keyboard, DVDRW optical drive, SSD Hard drive and SATA Hard drive combination for fast response times. Also I definitely wanted a 4th Generation Core i7 processor. I got all that I wanted with this particular laptop. It came with Windows 8.1 and I adjusted it to somewhat reflect the Windows 7 User Interface I am accustomed to.This exceeds my ASUS laptop by leaps and bounds. The backlit keyboard really comes in handy when typing in the night. The speakers are FANTASTIC and are even more optimized when used in conjunction with audio-enhancing software like DFX Audio Enhancer. Watching movies and listening to music is a real treat compared to the ASUS laptop which had the speakers in the back..........seriously what a stupid design. Speakers should be either to the front of a laptop or on the top of it but certainly NOT to the back and bottom of it.Overall this was a great choice and this is my first time buying a Lenovo laptop so I will definitely be recommending this brand based on my experience with this despite that it's only been roughly a week of usage with it.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gaming Powerhouse at Affordable Price", "Author": "RKoston", "ReviewID": "R2HJMWLH4D3OEB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where I bought -I bought this Lenovo Y510p recently on Lenovo Website for $879 + tax. Be sure to search for some coupon codes before buying and you can save $20 to $50 on top of the price which is displayed on the Lenovo website.Why I bought -My first laptop was from Lenovo (Y560) which served me well and was also a decent gaming machine. That experience prompted me to return to Lenovo.Review -1) Build Quality & Aesthetics - The Laptop looks great and feels solid. Lenovo has done a good job constructing this laptop. The screen lid is firmly attached to the body with 2 hinges. It has a metallic brushed look and feels great to touch. The whole laptop is a finger print magnet which can be annoying for some people. The back is solidly made of plastic with opening/grill for airflow. It has a full keyboard with a Numpad, the keyboard is backlit red, which looks cool. One thing to note is that this laptop has quite bigger bezels especially the top bezel, it does make this 15.6\" screen look smaller. Personally, a more closer to edge display would have been preferred.2) Performance - Lenovo Y510p is a lightning fast laptop. With 24GB SSD, the boot times are 15-25 seconds and every cached application opens in less than 3 seconds. It breezes through daily tasks of browsing, playing music, watching videos/movies etc. This laptop competes with this best in GAMING performance. Even with just one 755m card, every game can be played at High or Very high settings with frame rates easily above 30fps. I have tested the following -Game  Settings  Average FPS (frames per second)Tomb Raider  Very High  34Thief  Very High  35Metro Last Light  Very High  35Spec Ops The Line  Max  38All games were played at 1080p.3) Keyboard, TouchPad and Display - Aesthetically this is the best keyboard I have seen on a Lenovo. It is backlit, has 2 intensity settings and can be turned off as well. It is a full keyboard and the keys are well spaced to encourage typing. The touchpad is not so well done, it looks nice and is sensitive enough but the buttons are just flat and users might have problems registering a click. With daily use, you might get used to that. About the display, it is an eye pleasing Full HD display with great viewing angles, good for watching movies and playing games. At the top of the display, we have an HD Webcam.4) Ports & Connectivity - Y510p comes with all sorts of connectivity options. On the left, it has an HDMI out, VGA port, Ethernet port and 2 USB 3.0 ports. To the right, we have 3.5mm jack, Mic, Always ON USB 2.0 port and an Ultra Bay. UltraBay is a versatile slot which can used to expand by connecting an extra HDD, DVD drive, GPU or a cooling fan. If you would like to put in an extra GPU (currently on sale for $99 on Lenovo), be sure to buy the 170W power supply. The stock 120W power supply will fail and result in unstable system if used with SLI configuration. The laptop also has a 6 in 1 card reader and the Wifi Connectivity using the new 7260 b/g/n wireless card is flawless, no signal drops. There were problems related to the older Wireless Card N-2230 so please avoid that version.5) Battery Life & Portability - The battery life is around 4 - 5 hours under normal load (browsing, watching movie) and around 2 hours with heavy load(gaming mostly). Battery life was tested at default Balanced settings. Weighing in at close to 6 pounds, this laptop is light as compared to several other gaming laptops. However, I would not recommend carrying it around daily.6) Sound/Speakers - The speakers are placed at the top left and the right edges of the laptop. Y510p uses JBL speakers which are housed under a black grille with red accents (similar to keyboard backlight). These 2 speakers produce brilliant sound quality which performs well at high volumes as well and there is no distortion.7) OS & Software - The laptop comes with Windows 8.1 pre-installed and IE 11. It has typical lenovo software such as One Key Recovery (OKR), Energy Management and others like McAfee Trial and Microsoft Office Trial. OKR is very handy for taking backups and restoring laptop, if a serious problem arises.8) Heat & Noise - This laptop stays relatively cool under normal operation. While gaming, the temprature went upto 85 degree celsius max and hovered between 70 to 80 mostly. The GPU temp was between 65-72 mostly with a max of 77. These are normal tempratures for a gaming laptop. Anything more than 90 degree celsius should be a cause of slight concern and more than 100 is a warning sign. The fans are very quiet even under heavy gaming, no problem there at all. I would recommend buying a cooling pad, if you like to game more than 3 hours in a single sitting.My Final View -I love this laptop. It is a great piece of hardware at reasonable price. Lenovo has made exceptional advances in gaming hardware over the years and this one is a masterpiece. I definitely recommend buying this laptop, if your budget is less than $1000.Please feel free to ask any questions.

If you think an HP with Beats Audio will be better you are completely wrong.- 8 gb ram - much more than I'll ever need.- Quad core 4th Gen i7-4700MQ  (2.40GHz 1600MHz 6MB) - top of the line processor.- NVIDIA GeForce GT755M GDDR5 2GB  and Intel HD Graphics 4600 - dual graphics makes for longer battery life (intel card) and the nvidia card is great for gaming.- SSHD hard drive - a 1 TB hard drive combined with 24 GB SSD for a quick boot and large storage.- great 720p webcam for Skype and video chat.- high battery-life for a gaming PC. 5 hours at regular brightness.CONS:- The finish although matte is a super fingerprint magnet and takes a lot of rubbing to remove.- The touch-pad buttons are a bit awkward.- The bezel on the top is quite thick. Maybe because of the HD webcam??- It has a heavy 170w power adapter. So the regular ac adapters that you can get at your local PC shop will not work if you want to game- The keyboard is nice but the shift key on the right is quite tiny compared to other PC's. I have had a hard time adjusting.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic!", "Author": "FatedCb \"Every one of us has a purpose here.\"", "ReviewID": "R3CN2U572SIY1O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is a beast!
