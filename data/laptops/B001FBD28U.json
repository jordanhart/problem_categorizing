I needed a quick cheap laptop for school and CAD modeling (Solidworks & AutoCAD) and the Dell D610 with 2.13 ghz Pentium M cpu fits the bill just fine.  Everything worked out of the box, shipping was reasonable and prompt.  Not perfect...the power supply cord (which works) had ripped insulation, but this is an easy fix. This computer is a deal at $130.00 including shipping.
