Case", "ReviewID": "R1TB1U6QGBQHBJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two of these notebook computers for my grandchildren, aged 9 and 12.  They were thrilled!  They both have been using their Dad's laptop for homework assignments--research and word processing.  They found this notebook very easy to set up and use.  Of course, they like being able to watch DVD's on the notebook and to play some games, but these are mostly so they can do their school work.  I think they will last them for several years.  One advantage of this model is that it has Windows 7, which is what they were used to using.  I had read so many bad reviews about Windows 8 that I was happy to find a notebook that had Windows 7.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "very nice laptop", "Author": "Mark Wilkinson", "ReviewID": "R4P3TC4SWQ2EQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After finally getting this laptop,and having my youngest son set it up for me, I am very pleased with it. No issues so far. This was a christmas gift to my fiancee as her old laptop was litteraly falling apart. The screen is huge which she really likes. The only downside according to my son was that it took most of an evening to get all the stuff off of it that comes with the unit. I am computer challenged so I,m not sure what all it was so I take his word for that as he is an IT professional.

The picture is fantastic and it has all the features he wanted.  I have a problem with the keyboard, as my Dell does not have the numbers and I keep  putting my hands on the wrong keys..for now I will stick to my Dell until it decides to die..which, believe me, will be sooner than later.

I had used it without a problem the day before.I figured a reboot might fix the problem. AS it turned out I never booted.
