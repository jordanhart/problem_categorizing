Giannotti", "ReviewID": "R88F89J4UQDCP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received this laptop just yesterday, and was thrilled to see that it was loaded with Windows 8.1 and not 8.0, so I did not have to experience that huge download and install that 8.0 users have to go through to update to 8.1. In this instance, I am elated that the product was NOT as advertised! The only problem I experienced in the first few hours was that I was not able to scroll at all using the Synaptics Touchpad. I went online and noticed a lot of similar complaints at the HP, Microsoft and Synaptics websites. I tried downloading an updated driver that someone recommended, and the OS informed me that, no, it couldn't install that because I already had the latest software/driver for the Synaptics Touchpad. Thought for sure that I would end up having to wait for an updated Touchpad driver either from HP or Synaptics for Windows 8.1. Then, late into the night I took a peek at the little Windows Basics brochure that came with the HP laptop, and there I see a picture in the \"Using touch gestures\" section where TWO fingers are shown scrolling. Not the usual one, but TWO! Tried it. It works! Go figure; you now scroll with two fingers... mystery solved. Life is good. Getting to know Windows 8.1 is a little disconcerting having just come from XP, but all in all, not so bad. In fact, very cool in many ways. Boots extremely fast, runs real fast, and you can basically set it up to look very similar to XP/Vista/7. In fact, Windows 8.1 automatically \"senses\" if the machine it loads on is TouchScreen or not; when it loads onto a non-TouchScreen device, it boots right to the familiar desktop, and not the \"dreaded Metro interface\" that folks are screaming about.The HP 17-e020us is a thing of beauty, by the way. Beautiful screen and resolution, solidly built, handsome. Couldn't be happier with my new laptop. Fast delivery, nicely packaged, very easy to set up.

I don't have any particular brand loyalty, but the previous ran fine for around 6 years so I have no complaints regarding longevity and I got this one at a great price. I wanted one with a larger screen as I have taken up photography and I appreciate there is a SD card reader slot built in so I can load directly into the laptop without a reader. Even though this is a larger laptop it feels lighter and sleeker than my previous HP. The touchpad is also larger and is textured. I didn't care for the texture as I prefer it smooth, but its okay. It also runs cooler and quieter than the previous HP. In fact I played hours of video on YouTube and the computer was only a bit warm. Windows 8 took some getting used to, but I'm fine with it now. I find the start page apps load slow. I rarely use it and almost always go to the desktop where things seem to run faster and smoother. I didn't \"upgrade\" to Windows 8.1 as it wasn't compatible with all my software. I have been using this laptop for some months and I love it. Okay, this is not an Apple Powerbook, but then the price was so much more reasonable. I got this laptop on sale for around $400 so given the price I paid, I have something portable and the features I got it's a great value thus I gave it 4.5 stars.I have a few quibbles. The touch pad can be sensitive to my hand warmth and suddenly I find I have zoomed in or I find myself on the start page instead of my desktop or whatever. I wish they would put larger drives in these laptops/notebooks. These days media files take a lot of drive space and it isn't all that expensive for a drive with more memory, but I guess the corporations like to keep their pennies and a larger drive might use more power so less time if you tend to use it on battery a lot. I had some issues getting things running and I leave my story about that for those that may experience the same. I hope it helps others.First I had to get my older Canon laser printer to work with Windows. Windows did not have the driver or a generic driver that would work with it installed and wasn't able to install through the online update option. I had to go to manufacturer website download and install. But it still didn't work. So then I went back to manufacturer website and realized there was an update and some software. It was a matter of installing the software in the right order and then it worked.Then I realized the DVD drive wasn't working. I did research online and tried various things including Windows fix it. It still didn't work so I decided to use the advice of uninstalling the driver/firmware. As the DVD/CD in most laptops are apparently plug and play when you restart it will reinstall. It worked, but the after some HP updates and software installations it wasn't working again. I had to do more research and found the Cyberlink included software that was part of the HP updates/installations might be the cause. I uninstalled the software and as it was a suite it took awhile, but after uninstall the DVD player was working.I downloaded iTunes as I use an IPod and it wasn't recognizing the DVD drive. I realized at this point iTunes wasn't updating and didn't recognize my iPod. The iTunes testing software suggested it might be the firewall so I played with my firewall and even turned it off but iTunes still didn't work. As it tuned out it had nothing to do with the firewall. After playing with it and testing I figured out it was something simple. I had to activate my computer on iTunes. Just an added note on one of the updates for iTunes I and to restart my computer a few times to get it working and recognizing my iPod.The WiFi didn't appear to be working. I tried various things like manually configuring the Internet connection. I use an Ethernet cord so WiFi wasn't necessary at the moment, but I could see I might want to use it at some point. After trying various things, it turned out to be something simple yet not logical in my mind anyway. I had to give permission for \"other computer\" to connect to my Internet network connection with the code even though I was on the same computer on the same Internet connection, but just via WiFi. You would have thought it would recognize the computer since it was the same computer already on the Internet network.The Windows 8 Media Player also doesn't play DVDs. Go figure....you have to pay another 10 bucks to get Windows media center to play DVDs. Maybe MS has to do this for some reason. Anyway more research for free DVD player software. I didn't want to have to download a lot of adware either and even some purchased software these days has adware or external software attached and even if you decline the additional software install I have found sometimes it still installs it or ads pop up. At CNET the customers seemed to like ALC, but the newer version caused some Windows systems to crash. The customers didn't specify what version they were using. Not wanting to take a chance I found an older version of ALC that appeared to come from a source that wasn't going to add on ride along software and I have used this source before. I just crossed my fingers the website hadn't changed hands and now were adding stuff on to the freeware. So far the software is working well and I don't see any additional adware/software so all is good. I eventually purchased Nero so I could also burn CDs/DVDs, but in my opinion Nero runs a bit slow and the Media Center design is not to my liking so I can't recommend Nero on Windows 8. Thank goodness I don't burn many CDs/DVDs. I am not sure if Nero still has a free version for consumers to try out.HP didn't have Adobe Reader installed which I thought was odd as it's so widely used and free so I installed it. I also needed something that could read my documents and something I could write simple letters, etc. with. There is some MS software online and I am sure other apps consumers can use, but I prefer to use software I can access directly off my desktop. Luckily I had an uninstalled version of Office 2007 and it worked with Windows 8. I also decided to try some freeware called OpenOffice. OpenOffice has been around for quite awhile, but of course it Can't do every thing MS Office can do but what do you expect for free. The OpenOffice official website did not appear to adding adware/additional software so I downloaded from there and so far so good. I can open my Office documents and wanted to test it as I figure at some point they will update Windows 8 and Office 2007 may no longer work. I think they have stopped updating Office 2007.Well that's my adventure getting my printer and software to work on Windows 8. Now that it's set up and working I am a happy camper.

I actually purchased a separate wifi card to use with this computer, cause sometimes you know, I actually like to use the internet.Sure the card is rated at wireless n speeds, and sure my network monitor claims to have perfect signal and 65mbps connection, but actual use tells a different story. If I monitor the signal strength in db it will appear normal displaying a normal and acceptable signal, then will jump to -200db (very very bad) for a second and go back down - and it does this constantly!Speed test also confirms extremely unreliable wifi connectivity. But don't just take my word for it, buy this computer and then you too will know what a pos it is. Which pains me to say because its otherwise great and I used to think HP built quality computers (perhaps they did at one point in time, not anymore). Would not recommend. Would  not even smash to bits with 10ft pole.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP Pavillion 17\"", "Author": "Luz M Brown \"Marina\"", "ReviewID": "R3EZP7MSW9LDDP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have already a windows 8 laptop, although something was going wrong with it.

The problem is there were no parts for my model any more.  So they REPLACED MY LAPTOP!  NO charge!  I could not be happier with HP customer service!I would still photograph all sides of any product I would send in the mail (with a current newspaper to show the date sent) just in case it gets broken outside of your control.THANKS HP!  (To repeat: I did not buy this particular item.)Original review:  BE FOREWARNED:  HP SERVICE / WARRANTY IS NOT RELIABLE!!!The story:  I have an HP laptop which I sent in for warranty checkup (fix some rubber screen bumpers, cleaning, fan noise, etc.)  On the way there or at HP, it got damaged, which they claim was my doing and wanted $128 to fix it!  They were nice saying that was a \u00bd price offer!  But THEY caused the damage to the laptop!?  The reps said, \"Do you have pictures of the laptop?\"  Ha!  So when I refused to pay and it was returned, it would not even turn on!  I had a professional engineer open it and he said it must have been violently dropped as the CPU had come unseated.  Also they cracked the hinge on one side, so I couldn't close the lid w/o snapping the screen off.  I wrote a letter to the head of marketing and his assistant called back.  He offered me a nominal amount to trade up to another new laptop.  I declined as it wasn't a reasonable offer.  So be forewarned:  IF you get an HP product, the repair dept. may break it and the company will NOT fix it.  They will blame you.  IF you do send it in for repair, take a dozen photos from every angle as you'd have some proof.  I'd take a picture of the box just before you send it as well.  I have had 2 laptops, a camera, and printers from HP.  Never again.  I also sold my shares of HP stock!  BUYER BEWARE!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCE EVER! p.s.

I had my last laptop for 6 years and only just replaced it. Never had any issues with it...I only replaced the charger on it and that was it. Not even the battery needed replaced. Hp goes above and beyond my expectations and I am so thrilled about this laptop. The only thing I would change is that it's not a touch screen and it doesn't have a finger print reader. I'm sure if I wanted those things it would have been much pricier. My old laptop had both and was only 12 inches...it made it hard for me to do my school work on it.

Anyone would be surprised to know what this Hp Pavilion has to offer. To begin with many customers really enjoy the brand Hp. Also, this new Hp Pavilion has a long lasting lifetime of 4 hours and 25 minutes. This lifetime comes in handy when its use is something like writing a very long essay paper for a class. The owner will know how much time is left before the battery runs out. Another great feature is that the HP Pavilion laptop doesn't weigh much, some would say 6.39 pounds is an easy load to carry anywhere. It's most useful that the weight is not as much for example in college there are heavy books to lug around and having a lightweight  laptop will help tremendously by not adding more weight to what one already has to carry.  Something to really enjoy about this laptop is that most personal files data anything that one has in the laptop will be confidentially safe. It's important to keep this in mind when buying a laptop because one would want all their files and work to be stored in a safe place so that only one could see those files. There are many types of windows programs in computers but the good thing is that the Hp Pavilion comes equipped with Windows 8. I personally have used this window and I prefer this program more than other types of windows other computers have to offer. My favorite part about the Hp Pavilion is that one could sync pictures from their laptop directly to phones, tablets, or whatever type of electronic device. It's more than clear that this laptop has a lot to offer. Keep in mind that Hp Pavilion works very well and will not dissatisfy or disappoint the owner.I believe that with the years it becomes important to have a laptop. Having a laptop turns into a necessity and stops being a luxury. This Hp Pavilion will help many students with their school work. Nowadays, most assignments are online and students need to complete their homework. The Hp pavilion is most helpful when it comes to a research paper. This laptop offers the owner the possibility of multitasking one can be doing the research and typing the information all at the same time. Having a laptop such as this one is very beneficial in college because one could be typing class notes rather than writing them which is now the most perfected way. One could also be looking for information or get a head start on the notes online before class even beings so that one will have a better understanding of the lecture to come.  If one don't understand something one could always look it up on their laptop to find an answer. Even though, it's very important to use a laptop for school work, I believe that it's okay that every once in a while it is used to take a break and relax and have some fun with one's laptop. During class break one could play a game online or listen to music while one waits for class to begin. There's so much to be entertained with on the Hp Pavilion that one will be shocked to find and play all the games this laptop has.The Hp Pavilion is very useful in a variety of ways. One could also use it socially. Let's say one wants to go out and have some fun with friends but don't know where to go, one could simply search for something on your Hp pavilion and automatically thousands of places will show up. What many people like about the laptop is that one could Skype or message people from programs that are installed in the Hp Pavilion. There's so much that this laptop has to offer that one can't absolutely resist owning such an electronic wonder. As one can tell I highly recommend the Hp Pavilion 17-e020us if looking for a laptop. It has great features that I'm sure as a consumer one will gladly enjoy. Another good thing about this laptop is that it has great ratings from customers that have purchased this exact Hp Pavilion. It almost has a rating of five stars. It's very important to keep that in mind when comparing it to other laptops. You will be very happy once you get to explore the insides of this amazing Hp Pavilion 17-e020us.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good computer with a lousy operating system", "Author": "Susanna Ng", "ReviewID": "R35BUO6T8OMF50", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I brought this for my wife.
