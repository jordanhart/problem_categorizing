The wi-fi is keeping me connected as I'm typing this from a hotel room. The processor is nice and fast. There are four high-speed USB connections. The unit is solidly built (perhaps a mite heavy).My only criticisms are as follows:The screen resolution doesn't look quite as sharp as on my desktop monitor. I'd say, maybe 85% as sharp, so it's usually barely noticeable. The other thing is that the soundcard doesn't have all the mixer capabilities you might expect to find in a desktop. I don't know if this is common in laptops and I sort of stumbled upon the issue. But I got around it by purchasing an external mixer from the Guitar Center.I initially intended it only as a travel companion but have since begun using it in my recording studio (with Cakewalk Music Creator). Oh, and to play SimCity (which doesn't work on Vista!) All in all, I am quite satisfied with it.The seller shipped it out immediately and it arrived by FedEx or UPS (I forget which) in a matter of days (two or three, as I recall -- it was quick).", "Date": "September 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Invalid License", "Author": "R", "ReviewID": "R1IX5POFY725O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought one of these laptops two months ago. It has been working just fine. Today Microsoft told me that the license is not valid. It has a valid certificate of authenticity on the back but does not have a second \"refurbished\" CoA. When I look at the internal System Properties/General tab it says \"XP Corporate\" which means it was covered under a volume/site license which can not be transferred or sold. I will probably have to buy a fresh copy of XP ($150) and re-install.Before I made the order I checked to see that the advertisement specified \"Genuine Windows XP\". I also checked the CoA when it arrived. When the Microsoft updater offered to run \"Genuine Advantage\" to check the authenticity I confidently thought \"sure, go right ahead.\" Now every time I restart I get a big message that says I am a victim of software piracy. I expect the operating system will eventually simply stop running.", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "My best purchase deal.", "Author": "shojim89", "ReviewID": "R2RNRU7GNYQRV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this for my Ten year olds Christmas present and we love it.

It even has all the microsoft office applications for school or projects.

Of course there's gonna be some issues, it's to be expected.  I was looking for a really basic laptop for surfing, email, downloading music, etc.,and something that can play/burn cd's and play dvd's, not to mention basic word processing and so on.  Webcams, gaming apps, blah blah, weren't a factor.  I upgraded the g-wireless to g/n with an adapter no problem.  Had some issues with the speaker hardware, but fixed it with ms-support software I found on the internet.  Every now & then the 'net gets really, really lagging, but a reboot tends to solve it.  Again, it's been rebuilt; it's a little rickety in its construction, and it's an old model.  But the problems have been minor, and I am knowledgable enough to know where to go online for answers.
