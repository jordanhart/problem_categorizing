For the money it is very well equipped.  Battery life thus far seems to be a bit short at about 2 hours but is about what I've come to expect.  It comes with Windows 8 and no other option so you will have to learn to like (or at least tolerate) the new OS.  It gets better after further tweaking and tuning.  It is rather lean on preloaded software (trial versions of Office and Norton) but if you're loading your own things that won't be a problem.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Waste of money", "Author": "skipfly", "ReviewID": "R1TYSBJ1RS5HGA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the worst computer I have ever owned. I have had the product for only 6 months and have had to replace the Hard drive twice. The computer freezes while doing the most basic of tasks, online or off. I have an HP that is 4 years old, I spend more time on it than I do this one. Absolute waste of money to buy this computer. I would sell it, but I don't want to pass on this nightmare to anyone else. If you are looking for a reliable computer, look at other models. Don't waste your time or money on this one.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "AMD A4-3300M A70M Processor\n4GB DDR3 Memory / 500GB Hard Drive\n17.3\" HD+ BrightView LED-backlit display AMD Radeon HD 7420G Discrete-Class graphics and up to 2029MB total graphics memory\nSuperMulti DVD Burner Watch movies, and read and write CDs and DVDs in multiple formats\nWindows 8", "Name": "HP Pavilion G7-2223NR Notebook PC  (500GB, 4GB)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4137VLT14eL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009PHV7V0"}}
