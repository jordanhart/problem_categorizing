I am self-employed IT consultant and travel 100% of the time so reliability is key.  The machine has been completely trouble free and it is soooo light in my backpack.  The battery life is outstanding (almost tablet like) so I am able to use the laptop for most of my day without dragging around my power cord.  My homework on this model really paid off.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Computer for Work or Home", "Author": "L. M.

Caulfield", "ReviewID": "RDR6PNNOKL3L1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I use this object at work.  It does whatever it wants to do.  If you try to scroll, it will independently highlight everything on the screen and will not function until you are able to cancel the highlighting, which usually requires multiple efforts.  If, when working in a document, you linger too long on any part of your page, it will relocate the cursor to that area without warning.  If you hover anywhere on a web page, it will leave the page you're on and go to whatever link is nearby.  Frequently little menu screens pop up, completely unbidden, asking if you want to go back or copy a shortcut, etc., and you cannot get rid of the little screens or move forward with your work until they are gone - sometimes requiring you to reboot the computer.  I have seldom worked with anything as frustrating as this machine is.  I dread the days at work when I can't get the desktop and instead am relegated to using this oppositional device.  And are you kidding me - eleven hundred dollars?  You can get a decent laptop for half that.  This is a classic example of a machine devised for the workplace, where limitless corporate dollars buy something that a regular Joe would just get at Sam's - only the one from Sam's would work and you could get two of them with the same amount of money.  Really - this thing costs more than my Mac laptop?  I'm just stunned.  It's awful.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "There are way better Ultrabooks out there", "Author": "V.
