The only support I received is an email telling me that I can access to this page to get support, but when I tell them that chat is not working I never received an a reply again.I have had to move my computer 3ft away from the router, but even here I lose the connection frequently and I have to turn off the wifi at least 30 times at day, with my old Sony Vaio I could work 45ft away from the router without problem, I don't know what happened with Sony but if I had known that I couldn't work with this computer I would never have bought this computer.I used to love Sony, now I hate it, I will never will buy any Sony product again.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EEP2F1Y"}}
