Thrush \"snowbear55\"", "ReviewID": "R3SR5PYMFFKK66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this laptop. I did my homework before I bought it. Runs like new, Windows XP, few small, slight scratches. Good deal for the price. The seller was great as well. I think this laptop is going to be around for a good while. One thing I need to add to this review, when I bought it I had to email the seller for the original install disk that was supposed to come with it. Well I did get it but it lacks the COA. So now, after a year, I want to reinstall Windows XP. Hey, forget it, no COA! Can't use it without a COA. I don't use this laptop much, just for hooking up my embroidery machine to it.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell Latitude D630 Intel Core 2 Duo 2000 MHz 320Gig Serial ATA HDD 1024mb...", "Author": "humblepie", "ReviewID": "RYX1KLMY0UVPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i bought this for my wife and she loves it, enough saidwhen shes happy im happy so i love it also", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a review on the computer, not the seller.", "Author": "Ellen", "ReviewID": "R1HDZ7PR37H5VS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an excellent little computer, albeit used.

The first thing that popped up when I first turned it on was a warning that the battery was approaching the end of its useable life.  The second thing was it wouldn't connect to an unsecured network. The third thing is the two most used keys - the space bar and the enter key are sticking.  I had a very experienced computer technician stop by my office and he could not get it to connect to an unsecured network either.  He has since taken it back to his shop to probably replace the wireless card.  I wasn't expecting a new computer, but for nearly $300 I figured it would be a useable computer in good shape.  Should probably have spent the extra money and purchased a new one, since I will now have the repair bill on the wireless card as well.  It did have a short warrenty, but it took two weeks to arrive and I've messed around another two weeks with it now, so cannot afford another 4-6 weeks to ship it back and have the seller repair it.  Very disappointing.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME laptop", "Author": "Sandra Randol", "ReviewID": "R1FTF0NAXW5GY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop in May of last year 2013.
