Gail Davis \"Surfbaby\"", "ReviewID": "RITIXF1PB76QN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I tried 2 14 inch Asus laptops before settling with this one.  I liked them but they both had issues with functions.  This one has had no problems, seems much better in terms of reliability and speed.  It doesn't get hot, is fairly quick on start up, and the touch screen is perfect.  It does have the DVD drive, which I didn't necessarily need, but it does come in handy.  For one hundred dollars more, this laptop has a look and feel of a much more expensive computer.  The keyboard is Apple style.  The only thing I miss is a back lit keyboard.  Other than that, I would say this is just about perfect.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Christmas Gift Thrill of Mommy's Life", "Author": "Lori Holland", "ReviewID": "R1GTWPZGURQP5B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been scoping and pricing laptops for my mom for several months when I found - and bought - this Asus V551LA-DH51T.  This laptop is nearly perfect.  One complaint:  it's not backlit.  That's a minor quibble but I was a little disheartened by it.  That also explains the 4-star rating.  Otherwise, this computer is the perfect gift for those who aren't technically savvy but still pay their bills, send emails and read the New York Times on their computers.  This computer is the perfect gem for basic everyday use.  And the price was unbeatable.  Plus free shipping.

After only a few days, however, the touch pad stopped working. When I tried to use a mouse, that was also disabled. I was unable to turn the touch pad function back on so I called ASUS Customer Support. They were extremely polite and helpful and guided me through removal of my touch pad driver and installation of a new touch pad driver. My touch pad was operational again for a few more days afterward when it went out again. I plugged in a mouse and it worked for a little while and then it was also disabled again. I also could not get the computer to recognize my printer even after going to the HP web site and installing a new driver. Obviously, my ASUS laptop was defective, and I had to return it.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Only two small complaints", "Author": "elmcclell", "ReviewID": "R250Y409TTIAKR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my ASUS for two months, and so far I only have two small complaints:1) The wireless card drops the connection VERY often. It's usually only for a few seconds and then it comes back, but it's enough to be annoying. I got a separate USB antenna and that seems to have fixed the problem, but I don't think I ever should have had to do that for a laptop in 2014.2) The power adapter comes out of the socket very easily. This is partly due to the shape and the weight, I think. Even the slightest little jiggle knocks it loose. When the battery gets old and doesn't hold much of a charge, this will become more than annoyance.I've seen some complaints about the touchscreen, but it really just took me a little time to get used to it (how sensitive it is, etc.) and it's been no problem. The touchpad, on the other hand, is kind of irritating - it doesn't differentiate between the different kinds of swipes very well. But, that happens infrequently enough that I don't really consider it to be a complaint.Overall, I'm very happy with the money I spent on this laptop, and would recommend it to others. It should last me for several years.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "This computer is great!", "Author": "Michael Wright", "ReviewID": "R2IF8T3W2N20OH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this computer.

Touch screen is responsive and sensitivity is good.  Everything seemed okay except for ability to maintain an internet connection.  On both private and public systems, connection would inexplicably drop and then reconnect.  Updated drivers and had friend who is a PC Tech make numerous changes.  This improved but did not resolve the problem.  Also, the max volume is rather low.  It is okay for general use but if you plan to stream videos you may find it inadequate.  I have been told that there is an issue with Windows 8 and drivers but seems Asus should address this before selling these.  After purchase, I found a number of other Asus owners who indicated the same issue.  Returned it.  Very pleased with Amazon on the return.
