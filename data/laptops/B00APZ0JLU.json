Turned on first time, made some settings.  Next day tried to turn it on, and it would not turn on.  Talked to tech support and ended up sending to HP.  Received it back 4 days later, tried to use, and it would not recognize wi-fi.  Spent over 2 hours on the phone with a very patient helpful tech support person. Finally resolved the problem after doing a reset.  The reset lost many accessories/programs.  Microsoft now wants to charge me to down load the programs I lost.  Not happy with the product.  HP tech support personnel have been very good.  It may be that I got a \"lemon\"  so the only thing missing so far, is an offer to replace it with a new one.  According to the specs, It is only a 32 GB unit, and I had ordered a 64GB unit. It was supposed to come with two years free mobile broadband, but the email I rec eived from T Mobile after I set it up, says my free 1 month trial ends in November.", "Date": "October 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good tablet, but missing key features", "Author": "JohnnyCorporate", "ReviewID": "R3DVCDK18FKBJC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered the Elitepad along with a Dell Latitude 10 tablet (both have full versions of Win8) about two months ago.  I waited to review the HP until the stylus/pen was released (finally!) to make a fair assessment of them both.  Overall I really like the Elitepad.  The construction is solid, the ergonomics and form factor are about as good as it gets, and the screen resolution and aspect ratio are very business-friendly.  However, it's got two very big flaws:1) No SD card slot.  Seriously, if anyone plans to use this as a PC replacement, even a partial PC replacement, the onboard free disk space of about 36GB is not sufficient.  SD cards are relatively cheap storage, so not including a card reader was a huge mistake by HP.2) No onboard USB port.  It's got the USB dongle thing, but that becomes one more accessory that you have to carry around with you.One other issue with HP is that their supply chain is horrible.  They have only recently began shipping their stylus pen and the productivity jacket, and the tablet has been out for over 4 months.  They still have no idea when the keyboard jacket will be available.  This tablet should have been a huge hit when it was released but HP didn't have their act together and lost momentum fast.", "Date": "May 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Internet connection problems HP Elite Pad", "Author": "Fan Chongyi", "ReviewID": "R30YI7AEZKXAQ2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Admittedly I'm new to Win 8 and touch screens, but I've got plenty of experience with desktop and laptop PCs. My first few days with my Elite Pad have been an exercise in frustration. Every other computer in my house runs smoothly with the modem and router I have set up, but the HP Elite Pad is impossible to get to connect to the Internet. I looked a bit on the web and already I'm hearing that it's good to download and test older drivers in order to get the connection to work. Are you kidding? A brand new computer...and I'm advised to download older drivers? I have 90 days support under my warranty. I'm going to try that tomorrow, but if I can't get through I'm sending this HP back to the seller and giving up on this product.

However, the battery did not charge when the AC adapter was connected and this lead to my poor experience with the return process. I assumed it was the battery but I suppose it could have been the adapter. Needless to say I did very the AC adapter was plugged in a working outlet.My experience returning the unit to the seller was not good. It took me 3 days to receive the RMA number.
