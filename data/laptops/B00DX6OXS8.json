It came amazingly fast - great job Amazon.  Seeing the two negative comments about the wrong shipment, I immediately checked my E431 (after we opened it on Christmas morning that is, because I wrapped it upon arrival).  I got lucky it seems.  Everything matches as advertised.  Quad i7.  128 GB Solid State Drive.  14\" touchscreen.  8G RAM, etc. The computer itself seems to be exactly as advertised and works well, however the box came with the laptop and nothing else - no spec sheet in the package, no disks, no nothing but a basic one page guide on how to put the battery in.  (Peculiar and somewhat unsettling - but the Lenovo user guide info is loaded on the disk in a PDF manual.)I love the Solid State SATA Hard Drive!  Boots in seconds rather than minutes.  I will never buy a laptop with a spinning disk again (although I'll use them as external drives for backup etc.)The E431 screen is sharp and brilliant in color.  The touchscreen works very well.  I love the feel of the keyboard.  Touchpad is great too IMO.  No problems with Wifi connections.  Etc.What I'm still unsure about, however, is if I will ever \"get it\" with Windows 8.  The laptop came with Win 8 Pro, and I was able to do a free upgrade to Win 8.1 Pro.  I have a long heritage using PCs up to Win XP on the PC side, Apple OS X on the Mac side, and Apple iOs on the smartphone side.  I was quite happy with Win XP overall (service pack 3 mind you).  And now I'm learning Win 8.1 ...but slowly.  There are a few \"features\" (aka quirks) that I'm not sure I like at all, and I wonder if I ever will.  TBD.E.g.,Figuring out how to do the 8.1 upgrade was ridiculously complicated.  There were so many intermediate steps it was painful and took much longer than it should have.  Once I got going, it worked out well enough, although I had to reinstall a Dolby audio driver from the Lenovo website because an error message about it appeared during reboot.  Not a big deal - it was not an urgent correction.  However, learning how to Manage Users was a real pain!  I wanted to set up accounts for my children while my account remained as the administrator account.  I checked online advice, like at CNET, and they reported the same weirdness in how Win 8 manages users.  What the heck is Microsoft thinking?  (Go ahead - try it yourself, setting up an initial account is easy enough, but let's say you want to then reset a password.  An arcane process.  Go figure.)  But none of this is Lenovo's fault - they built a nice laptop that I spent less than $1000 for versus ~$1500 for an equivalent Macbook Pro.  I just need to decide if using Win 8 is worth the $500 savings before I buy again.  I have my complaints about Max OS as well - neither is perfect.  Maybe by the time \"service pack 3\" comes out for Win 8, it will be worth sticking with.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop for the price", "Author": "Bob Ulmer", "ReviewID": "R3G3O5D2HFBF6K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great laptop for the price.  Responsive, powerful, easy to mange.  Drawbacks for me is the trackpad and the FnLock.  Clicking on the trackpad doesn't always register if you are not in the exact space and there is no way to set the FnLock on in the Bios so it startups up that way.  You have to go in and turn the extra functions off on the F Keys each time to start up the PC.", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this laptop", "Author": "reddy", "ReviewID": "R2AFWDOE3KOSBG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shipping by Adorama is very quick.I am technical guy, so I was looking at computer which can handle huge load.I couldn't buy T series as they are very costly.Pros:System is very fast as it has i7 processor, 3rd generation. 4th generation has only 10% boost in performance, which is negligible when compared to there price. However 4th gen saves power however I am in no mood to save power.boots in 3-4 seconds-  thanks to ssdtouch screenCons:SSD is only 128gb. I have lot of softwares to install, thus only 5-10 gb is left.so u have to upgrade ssd or buy another 500gb portable hard disk.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "I received a quite different laptop.", "Author": "yuli", "ReviewID": "R1BRJTAZ0M20GO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I can not understand why the received laptop's cpu is I3, hard drive is 500GB and memory is 4GB.
