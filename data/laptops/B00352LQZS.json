{"Reviews": [{"Title": "In-Depth Review", "Author": "Dan Greenberg", "ReviewID": "R2OJT0HFQWI06I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this. Looked at it for a few days on [...] to get detailed specs and customer reviews before purchasing. I only bought it on amazon because the next day shipping was cheaper (about $[...]) and the computer itself was $[...] less on amazon.Haven't pushed the pedal to the metal as far as ram, HDD, and CPU go. There is an overclocking speed (called Turbo Boost) that is automatic. With windows 7 (instaleld) the Turbo Boost app lets you see the CPU ramping up. It shows that the CPU rutinely goes up to 2.6 Ghz when opening an application (not very intensive work) so I am not sure how accurate the gadget is, but we'll see. When compared to what else is out there, this coputer has much more for your money and is actually cheaper than many laptops with less power/graphics capability/coolness. Look at the prices at Best Buy for an Core i3 laptop. They are nearly $1000 and don't have as much ram, video memory, or upgrade potential. This is a Core i7, much more powerful and is less than alot of the laptops out there. Plus, Asus has a 1 year accidental warranty. Tops!Pros:-Amazon said it would be Brown, mine was black when I got it. Brown is ugly anyway!- You can create a recovery DVD to fix everything in the event you scrw something up. Also, has a bootup recovery option built in, so even if you don;t have the disks, it can be recovered.- 1 year replacement/repair \"i dropped it in a pool\" warranty.-Shipping. For the price of the computer, get the 30.00 next day. I order by 3:00PM on thursday and had the computer booted up at 3:15PM friday.-Nice looking computer. Great sound. Great price. (You can get a lesser model without the i7 CPU from Best Buy for 999.00)-USB 3.0 is nice touch. Cool touchpad with \"gesture\" recognition.-I like the screen. The resolution is said to be a little low/poor for the machine, but I do not yet find it to be a problem. You can zoom in and out using the touchpad and gestureing, so if the icons look to big/small, you can change it up without messing with screen resolution. Basically, you can keep it in 1377x768 mode. HD screen looks good to me. Bright too.-HDMI output! You can hook this thing up to your big ass HD flat screen.- With Windows 7, some \"gadgets\" aka iphone style \"apps\" that can be installed to the desktop require 32bit. This computer has the 64bit Windows 7 so you have to do some playin around to get those gadgets to work. Pandora is one of those. However, you can have a applet for Pandor Radio on the desktop without needing an open internet explorer window. Cool!- POwer saving one-touch button. NOt sure how effcient it is yet.- So far, Windows 7 is not that bad. Yet. :)CONS:- A lot of \"bloatware\" on this baby. You have to sort throught it all and see what you like/don;t like and uninstall whatever you can live without.- At initial boot up, 80 processes running! Ouch. 33% of RAM in use. That's over a Gig. Trim down the fat and you should be good.-The first time I launched the \"See how cool this Asus computer is\" demo, I needed to lower the volume. Whn I did so, the computer locked up, blaring a annoying sound. I had to hold th epower button for 4 sec to turn off manually. Not cool. After that though, all seems cool.- The keyboard is a little cheap, has some play to it. Go to Best BUy and type on one of their floor models to see if it is bad for you or not. Not a deal breaker for me, but kinda lame. The \"full size keyboard is not true, it is laptop sized with a number padd on the right. The arrow keys (if you play games or use spreadsheets) are small and you can easily miss them and hit the 0 or control key.- With Windows 7, some \"gadgets\" aka iphone style \"apps\" that can be installed to the desktop require 32bit. This computer has the 64bit Windows 7 so you have to do some playin around to get those gadgets to work. Pandora is one of those. However, you can have a applet for Pandor Radio on the desktop without needing an open internet explorer window. Cool!- A lot of Asus \"this and that\" programs to deal with. I uninstalled half of them.BOTTOM LINE:Buy it. Remove what you don't like. Great deal. If you were going to spend 800, drop an extra 2 bills and get this one. If you were going to spend 1200, save you money and get yourself a case for this one once you buy it.", "Date": "March 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "AWESOME LAPTOP!", "Author": "_Voltron_", "ReviewID": "R25JY1WFV7FY8X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My two concerns when purchasing this laptop were:A.) The Brown Color (it looks pretty brown and ugly in Amazon's photos)B.) The Screen resolution of 1366 x 768And upon receiving the product, this is what I've foundA.) While it is brown, its a VERY dark brown that appears black in most lighting conditions. Only under direct light or white light does this even resemble a brown color. It does not look like that milky chocolate brown in the Amazon photos.B.) The screen resolution (1366 x 768) is a tough pill to swallow. The 768 vertical resolution is really hard to handle if you are used to laptops with higher screen resolutions. The amount of vertical scrolling and real estate for multiple windows opened at the same time is difficult with this resolution. This is not really a deal breaker for me because I have this connected to multiple external monitors, but if you intend to use the laptop screen as your primary display device, this screen resoultion is pretty poor. Its probably fine for watching DVDs or playing games at high settings so the native resolution can handle it, but I would have really preferred 1600 x 900.With that said, this ASUS N61 laptop is absolutely fantastic. The build quality is excellent. Its a very solid, sturdy built machine with no flex in the display or the keyboard. It looks great with a clean polished look without all the ridiculous gaming machine graphics all over it. It has better than average sound quality and the display (aside from the screen resolution) looks great. I found the battery life to be more than acceptable because this has a quad-core processor and a 7,200 RPM drive with a fairly small battery (I dont want a big heavy battery). I'm getting a little over 2 hours, which I consider very good all things considered.I previously owned a Sony F Series laptop with the Intel i7 processor and the Sony had EXTREMELY loud fan noise trying to keep it cool. I was scared at purchasing another i7 because I thought they were all like that, but that is not the case with this ASUS. The fan is very quiet. At idle its whisper quiet and under load it revs up but its a lot quieter than the Sony was. It also has a special power setting that keeps it quiet (perfect if you are in dead silent room and dont want to hear the fan).The i7 is an absolute beast of a processor. I am batch processing thousands of images, analyzing about 3.2GB of data in SQL server, watching WinTV, downloading huge files via FTP, and compiling C code AT THE SAME TIME and this thing never skips a beat.Aside from the lousy screen resolution (why its only 4 stars) I am very happy with this purchase. I am so glad I returned the Sony F Series and bought this.

Amazon has changed it's ad for this laptop since our company purchased this unit, as it does not have the TV grade, additional amplifier and cone speakers etc, which was advertised.  Asus website still has these features listed, including a really nice video touting their laptop.  Simply doesn't exist on N61Jq units.Turned the laptop on for the first time, providing name /date/time, password and reached the create the System Restore DVD's (four required)part of setup. Inserted first new DVD disc and a half hour later, this laptop Blue Screened, BSOD, on SETUP.  When finally back at the point of doing the Restore discs for second time, the second attempt to do Disc #1, few minutes later another error box and BSOD again.  This is going well. Now on third attempt to do Disc #1 which started at 26% ?? and later, FOUR hours later, the four dvd backup discs are finished.  Don't expect I could trust these discs to Restore anything.  Day Two: ASUS was sent all the technical stuff (codes and information beyond my technical expertise, hoping only to provide Asus with information to fix the problem, OR be able to find out it's not repairable, information easily found using Windows 7 which I believe is the best thing Microsoft has done in some time and gasp! might even be better than XP.  Four separate emails and tech numbers from Asus later, the Asus techs are still talking about SRS drivers and issues nothing to do with BSOD.  Since initial setup, the unit in the past three weeks BSOD two more times while watching two movies from internet.  Interesting only for having nothing to do with DVD drive in unit.  The N61Jq-X1 as of yesterday is on it's way back to Amazon.  Going to purchase a Sony VPC-F111FX/H  or if Amazon takes forty days to credit the N61 like they did the N10, will order one directly from Sony.<Note, clarify previous remark: Amazon is normally very good at returns and taking care of customers problems, and Amazon is a vendor our company will pay a  little more to buy from Amazon due to this customer service.  Everyone will have a bad day, so I wanted to be fair and temper the remark made here with additional facts.  In the big universe of vendors wanting your money, you'd be hard pressed to find a company doing better by their customers than Amazon.  Dillon Precision is one, they're out there, but the bar is up high.>It is likely in the universe of all the laptops which Asus produces that a couple of 'lemons' will come from their factory.  Have two big issues with ASUS,  First is their Tech Service from two different laptop, our experiences with ASUS Tech department in the past six months is deplorable.  Second, I have a real BIG problem when a manufacturer touts features and hardware that is NOT actually in the laptop.  Go to Asus home website  asutech or [...],, go to Products, to Laptops, Multimedia units, then click on N61, then click on N61Jq  or any N61J  code,, look at the Sound System you should have,  Watch Asus video...THE SOUND SYSTEM, SPEAKERS/AMPLIFIER ETC. JUST ISN'T THERE.  AMAZON IS CURRENTLY CHANGING SEVERAL WEBSITES ADS SINCE THE INFORMATION ASUS FURNISHED THEM WAS WRONG.  INDEFENSIBLE TO SELL A PRODUCT WHICH FALSELY DESCRIBES THE HARDWARE THE CUSTOMER IS EXPECTING TO RECEIVE FOR HIS MONEY.Just wanted to balance out the rave reviews,, I'm sure Asus does make some good units,  the free information is always worth what it costs you.  davzway/  TSRW INC", "Date": "March 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing value!", "Author": "Joseph P.

When I ordered this laptop I was worried I would get the UK keyboard layout with the large return key and the backslash key in a inconvenient location.  When I received the laptop I was pleased to find that it was the standard US keyboard layout with large enter, backspace, shift, and control keys which is a nice change from other laptop keyboards that have smaller keys.Color:The page says the color is dark brown but appears black under almost all conditions, a plus in my book.  I had to shine the back with an LED flashlight for it to appear brown.  I haven't taken outside in direct sunlight but it may appear more brown outside.Build quality:I would rate this a medium.  It shouldn't break under normal use but it doesn't look as sturdy as some others. Very bright white LEDs on both sides of the laptop blink when in standy mode or when powered on make the laptop distracting in a darker room.  I like the quiet fan volume.  Even the DVD drive is fairly quiet.  Screen hinges look nice and shouldn't break easily.Performance:Windows 7 boots fast!  Windows Experience Index of 5.9. Runs most all modern games on high quality.  Great performance for the price.Ports:Aside from the standard ports, this laptop has an HDMI port with audio out, one USB 3.0 connector, an eSATA connector!Bundled software:Comes with standard game demos, Office 2007 trial, and various ASUS utilities.  Nothing special but not nearly enough to be considered bloat-ware.  Comes with Windows 7 and driver re-install disc as well as recovery disc maker software.Audio:Great sound quality for laptop speakers. No noticeable distortion even at high volume!Battery life:Mediocre, I average about 2 hours in power saving mode.  But what do you expect from a gaming laptop with an i7 processor?

If you're getting this laptop I wouldn't count on this feature.It feels surprisingly light.The hinge is sturdy - i expect it to last.The sound: I can see both opinions - it can sound tinny - but it's also... guess what? A laptop. And no, there isn't cell phones with better speakers - although i've seen some that are pretty close to this. There just isn't any lows, and barely any mids - if you really want good sound, ignore the hype Asus created in their advertisement of these speakers (all that's really exciting about it is that the normal laptop speakers are arranged in some special way-and it comes with some tuning software) and get a pair of some decent desktop speakers. Don't expect any miracles with the sound. That being said, the built-ins are decent laptop speakers (the stereo effect will certainly surprise you). & They are plenty louder than my Macbook's built-ins - so i'm not disappointed with it. The sound required some minor tweaking in the SRS software to get it to my liking.The hand rest is a fingerprint magnet, I can tell it's going to be difficult to keep clean - the fingerprints go on, but they don't wipe off as easy as if it were a gloss plastic.The back, indeed looks black. It's pretty & understated.There isn't a terrible amount of bloat-ware.. I uninstalled all of the game trials and a few other programs and that was all i had to do.It's pretty thin for a laptop this size - not fat looking like those terrible HPsMine came with 1333 ram.I created a backup DVD set when i got the laptop - and that took about 2 hours (compressing the files, creating an iso, and burning 4 discs) with the supplied backup software.I haven't run down the battery yet - but it says about 1.5 hours.The video card is...awesome. I ran Battlefield Bad Company 2 (a DX11 game) on all of the highest settings (8x anti-aliasing, highest resolution etc.) And it ran perfectly except for a bit of slow down during massive explosions etc. - but, when the anti-aliasing is turned down to 4x it runs just fine.I was planning on getting an X25M SSD for this laptop - but...It doesn't really need it! Boots up in seconds... Photoshop opens in about 4-5 seconds...I saw today that apple revamped their macbook & MBPs - and after looking at them - I would still buy this laptop. It's $1,800 cheaper...

And YES I knew the specs going in and took a chance but well you can't fight the numbers sometimes. Yes, the older LT display is significantly better. Much darker blacks, hence better contrast. Phillip/LG made the screens for the Gateway back when and they are excellent, near Plasma black levels I dare say. Now granted the Gateway is a 17\" 900 screen where the ASUS is only 15.6 /768 but if you are using Adobe/Lightroom or Nikon Capture NX2 you will be disappointed, unless of course  you use an external display (more money) then all bets are off. But that defeats the purpose in my case. So off it went.I did however do a Performance test using PC Wizard 2010 and the ATI/AMD 5730 scored very high as well did the Hitachi 7.2k HD based on results comparing to a I7 750 unit PC Wizard uses as a reference. So for the gaming crowd this unit should please. The unit is very well made, has amazing keyboard feel and is very quiet and as others have pointed out for the price nothing comes close with this type of quality.  Cons: It does run a little hot, I would suggest a Antec laptop USB cooler or similar device. Value: A closely config. Del* cost several hundred more and does not offer USB 3.0 or DirectX 11 which will be important sooner than latter.

Dump the bloatware and this thing just what seems to be a limitless about of desktop processing power.For single threaded apps it overclocks the clock speed to 2.8ghz, for multi-threaded it uses 1.6ghz two threads per core that works wonderfully in windows 7. As for the gpu I regret that I haven't put much on in the way of games, however I saw a notciable improvement in video playback on both it's led screen and my monitor colors just seem more vibrant and the playback is smoother I don't know if this is just because I haven't used an ati card in awhile or no. The only game I have tried was street fighter 4 everything on max with no AA left me with 60fps at the native laptop resolution.As for the case and screen the the led screen is alright, the viewing angle isn't so good thought it is still backlit I would say my other screen was better in fact. As for the case all around the keyboard and keypad is rubber..

I bought this laptop on March 1, 2010. The first thing I did was max out the memory to 8gb. The i7 and the Mobility Radeon HD 5730 make this machine the beast it is. When I set out to buy a laptop back in 2010 I was looking for a desktop replacement that could run the Adobe Creative Suite and play games too. I work a lot in Photoshop, Indesign, After Effects and Premier Pro so I needed a beefy machine. Three years later and I'm still creating with zero glitches or lag using Adobe CS6.Now about a year ago I did experience overheating on both the processor and video card which resulted in the laptop turning off. Note that the laptop always runs 8-10 hours a day in high performance. The symptoms appeared when I began playing Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. In response to the issue, I loaded GPU-Z and realtemp.exe and diagnosed it as overheating. I suspect that those other reviewers who have had video card failure experienced overheating. Now check this out. After I collected the overheating data I contacted Asus even though the laptop was out of warranty. I informed them of the situation and they promptly sent me a label to send in the laptop. I had the laptop back in two weeks. I'm not bothered by the overheating because Asus support is topnotch in my book. They've made me a brand loyal customer. I bought two of my kids Asus laptops for Christmas.Anyway, if I had a complaint it is with the battery life. It died in its 13 month. In short, Asus stands behind there product and this product is rock solid in it's 3rd year.", "Date": "May 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "A perfect laptop for patient people", "Author": "Eric", "ReviewID": "R28SYANZR2NKAY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for just over 2 years now, and I have to say, I'm impressed. It has a couple quirks, but for what I payed for it, it's a champ, any issues I had with it I've been able to resolve myself, first off, I'll list the cons that I've run into in my 2 years of laptop ownership.CONS:1. HEAT - This laptop is by no means a lightweight, this is a desktop replacement, boasting a beefy i7 processor that runs standard at 1.6 GHz, and goes up as needed to 2.2. That means this thing pumps out quite a bit of heat, idling usually around 60 degrees Celsius, going up to 85 under max load. That being said, the cooling system used is very efficient, as long as you keep the fan clear (easily reached through the bottom panel) and don't block the port, you won't have issues with it. Not once during the time I've had this laptop has it overheated, through basic use, through Minecraft, Mass Effect, Just Cause, and pretty much anything else I've thrown at it.2. HARD DRIVE - Just about a year after I got the laptop, the hard drive died in a spectacular crash during use, but as a 320G drive is barely passable these days, not a big issue for me. The issue actually came up after I popped in the nice and roomy new 750GB drive, where a number of windows functions didn't appear to work. This was resolved simply by reinstalling the Intel Storage Utility, as the driver in the laptop didn't fully support drives that large.3. BSOD - This guy had me stumped for a good long time, randomly during use, I would get a Blue Screen directed towards the USB 3.0 Driver crashing, fiddling with the bios, reformatting, and trying different drivers did nothing, so I chalked it up to a hardware issue UNTIL I discovered that the problem was easily fixable in windows settings. Turns out the 3.0 port doesn't like being put on standby to save power, so just switching all the settings in device manager to not allow windows to do that fixed all problems.So, in summary, for the cons, Keep your exhaust port clean and open, Intel Storage Utility for big drives, and power settings for the USB ports in Device Manager. Do this and you'll be as happy as a clam with this laptop.The nicest thing I note about this laptop is that it has room to grow, you don't pay through the nose up front for easy upgrades you can make later. Hard Drive? A little small, but it's a standard, just pop in a new one, takes maybe 5 minutes, same with the RAM, starts at 4, and  goes up to 8 whenever you feel like it.", "Date": "October 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY ASUS ALTEC LAPTOP", "Author": "Saji Mathew", "ReviewID": "RVKSSYNMUMZ6P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am so unhappy with purchasing this laptop.

Ly", "ReviewID": "RS98K7TN8T3AA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this computer for about a year now, so I can offer a review here without the bias of that initial haze of excitement.Pros:-The technical specs are good. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I've been able to run everything I've wanted to run smoothly except GTAIV (but performance-wise, that game is broken anyways), including WoW, The Sims 3, Civilization V, and the Total War series, all on high settings. Light modeling and Photoshop also ran with no issues.I've listed a lot more cons than pros, but keep in mind that the pro is an important one.Cons:-If you use this computer on your lap, it runs uncomfortably hot. I mean it.-The power cord comes off very easily. Moving it around almost ensures that it will fall out. Again, if you use this on your lap, I guarantee it's going to go unplugged unnoticed at least once.-Gets dirty easily.-The screen seems to make contact with the keyboard when the lid closes, so the grime from the keyboard occasionally gets on the screen.-Not recommended if you are the sweaty palm type. Heat + prone to grime + sweaty palms = very, very bad. I'm constantly cleaning the area to the left of the touchpad where my palm rests because it's constantly gross. I never had such an issue with my other laptops.-Too big to frequently carry around (I'm a college student). I had to offset this by purchasing a netbook.As neither a pro or a con, it makes a moderate amount of noise. It does get noticeable while gaming.In the end, I'd recommend this computer if you're only in it for the specs and the price. As for me, I wish I would have looked more into other factors, like size, heat, and comfort before making my purchase. It runs everything I need to, but it's uncomfortably large, hot, and dirty.

This laptop is awesome. I am very happy that I purchased this laptop. It is very fast everything runs great on this machine. This is my first Asus laptop and I am so so so happy I purchased it. I am a big gammer so all of the games I have played have worked without any problems on high settings. I play mostly MMORPG type games, so I have played WOW, ROM, Atlantica, and soon Star Craft 2, every game I have thrown at this computer it has worked without a problem.  I also run alot of programs because I am currently in school so I have alot of applications open, and I have my browser open with prob over 20 + tabs, and I have multiple games running in the background along with my Norton working in the background and other background services and this thing DOES NOT SKIP A BEAT. With all that going on I haven't seen this computer over-clock it self yet so its well worth getting the Asus i7 series laptops. The volume is great on some things and others its pretty crappy, the screen is awesome I am not sure what everyone is complaining about because it looks great to me. The keyboard is a chicklet type keyboard but I love it, it doesn't flex on the left side well not on my computer so I am not sure where people are getting that from either, but then again I don't type really hard, I am very fast lite typer, but I have typed hard to see if it flexes and it doesn't so maybe its just their computer. Some people are complaining that there is not a backlight on the keyboard, well all I have to say about that is it would be nice but I type without looking at the keyboard so it really doesn't matter to me.Now the only bad thing I have to say is the laptop is a finger print magnet and a dust magnet because I am always cleaning this beast LOL. The color is a very dark dark brown and you can't tell it is a brown color unless its under direct light but it doesn't bother me because it looks very professional and I like that. It does get a little hot on the left hand side but the fan does a good job keeping it cool. I did buy a laptop cooler but I don't think it really needs it but I use it anyways and it keeps it pretty cool, but this a laptop after all with alot of power so what can you expect it will get hot sometimes! Over all this is a great computer for just the causal user or for someone who needs alot of power. If you can get this computer when its on sale then grab it, even if you can't the price amazon is offering for this computer is still wonderful because I did alot of research and you can't get this much power with this size screen with any other computer or for the same computer from a different company its more expensive. I had doubts about buying this computer at first and after doing alot of research at least a week worth of research reading reviews and all sorts of thing and I still found that this is a freakin awesome computer from an awesome company. If your a gammer then get this beast it will handle all your games, if you need power for other things and software then this is the computer for you. Like it says its an entertainment laptop I have viewed HD movies on here and it is so amazing, I use headphones ofcourse so the sound comes across great, im a computer geek and very picky so if i suggest this computer to other people then its good.

I named it! lol. I also watched the advertisement video of the first generation of core i... processors. Wow...nostalgicThe N61JQ-X1 did give me my first BSOD as well as the yellow/blue squares *for me* before I crashed just about 3 months or so after i purchased it in april 2010. However, what I quickly realized is that those crashes were also due to the laptop's heat, and i'm sure you know what i'm talking about. I live in the Caribbean so I can definitely testify about the laptop's heat generation. About a year or so though, after trying to combat this problem by directing a fan to it *since my room doesnt' have AC unlike the computer lab when I was in high school*, this wasnt' going to work anymore. Afte putting it on, I noticed through some temp monitors that my processor and gpu were reading about..80 to 90 degrees (celcius) on regular/idle states, and the room temperature for me here was/is about 30 degrees during the day. I tried applying thermal paste *arctic silver* to the cpu and gpu, but, I didn't notice any drastic change -- only by about 2 degrees. So yeah, about...6 months from this post, I decided to start eliminating the temperature spike by removing the back panel and, it's dropped by 20 degrees now. Oh and I was using the cooler from the time I got the laptop by the way. However, despite all these problems, I'm still impressed by the laptop. I can even run Crysis 3! Back in the day, I could've run Gears of war, Resident Evil 5, Call of Duty  MW2 on max settings. Lol. It takes your back. But this baby isnt' out yet and isnt' close to that.I'm not sure why others have experienced worse problems such as the loss of their fans etc., but I guess I was one of the fortunate one to notice how to counteract this heat problem a bit quickly. Currently, I have windows 8 instaleld on it, 64 bit, *pro version* and it's running quiite smoothly. No problems, except of course, the heat, and this darn webcam problem I've experienced since 2011, where it keeps telling me that another program is using it etc. and yeah, I've tried a lot to fix this issue.But the point is, I'm quite pleased with this laptop. It's given me sooo much service, and I'll continue to use it happily, just not as continuously now, as I've been using it literally for at least 8 hours every day since 2010. It's amazing to see how far we've reached in just 3 years, since this laptop uses about 34% more power than the average laptop at the moment.http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2RNKFQSJQDVX2/ref=topnav_lists_1This is the rig I'm building and I shall be building it when the rest of the parts come a few days after I post this. I've moved onto the desktop stage, and perhaps next year, I'll go with Asus again, but this time, with the haswell processor and perhaps the maxwell gpu. However, I'll go with less rigorous specs.But overall, I'm quite pleased with this laptop, and I thank Asus for designing this. It's served me well in its.

Heslin", "ReviewID": "R2HYXIRXVRTUE8", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Asus N61JQ-X1's performance is excellent, when it works. That's the good. But it is too cheaply made, unreliable and has too many hardware failures. I suspect that a lot of these glowing reviews were probably done when the laptop was brand new before it stood the test of time.I have had this laptop since September 2010 and it's now March 2013. At about a year and a half the fan went out. I replaced it, not a big deal in itself. At about the same time the video card started going out. Suddenly while working the video card puts yellow vertical stripes on the monitor while the system freezes and hangs. I have to power off and restart to use the computer again. The yellow stripe freezes/crashes have become more and more frequent. At first it was a couple times a month, now it is once a day or even more. Now I will have to buy another video card. All my other laptops lasted years without any hardware going bad. Planned obsolescence? Cheap parts and build quality? I don't know.The Asus N61JQ-X1 is marketed as USB 3.0, the latest and greatest and \"future proof\". What they don't tell you is that ONLY ONE of the THREE USB ports is actually USB 3.0 (the single one on the left side). The other two are USB 2, the 2 on the right side of the laptop. Pretty bad, especially since most buyers will never even know they're using the slower USB 2 ports, while incorrectly thinking they are using USB 3.0 when they're not.The speakers are terrible, about the quality you would expect from a cell phone earpiece speaker. The native 1366x768 screen resolution is horrible too as others have mentioned. This computer is much better utilized as a desktop replacement with an external monitor and speakers.The webcam built into the top of the screen was installed UPSIDE DOWN. Apparently this is a common problem with Asus N61JQ-X1s as I've seen it a lot in Asus forums when researching other issues. Any and all webcam software you use will have to have an option to flip the picture vertically, as all software or web sites default to an upside down picture. Maybe you will be one of the lucky ones in the 50 50 roll of the dice and your N61JQ-X1s webcam will be installed right side up. Good luck with that.Another serious problem with the webcam when I was running the OEM Windows 7 (Installing Windows XP 64-bit fixed this problem), the webcam would rarely work, instead a Windows error message would pop up saying \"Web Cam is Already In Use by Another Program\". Every time I attempted to use it, it would do this, when NO other program was using the webcam. Sometimes disabling and re-enabling the webcam in device manager would fix this but more often than not it wouldn't, and you were just S*** out of luck if you needed to use the webcam. Sorry, it just doesn't work. Never did from day one. Again, installing Windows XP x64 fixed this issue.As other reviewers mentioned Asus (India based obviously) technical support is completely and 100% useless. You will accomplish NOTHING with Asus technical support, this I guarantee you. You might as well figure it out yourself or pay someone who knows what they're doing. Asus would be better off with no technical support than pretending to have technical support while it is completely worthless.The following could be Windows 7 issues but I will include it here.When it was brand new, out of the box I had constant repeated BSODs. This happened with the brand new factory setup. Still the same after restoring the Windows 7 to factory with the recover feature. This improved after I removed the Asus bloatware and cleaned it up. I continued to have other problems where system settings would change themselves and operating system services would suddenly be stopped seemingly on their own. This happened almost regularly to the point I got sick of it. Also, settings I would change would change right back later or after the laptop was rebooted the next time.Many times I had to restore the hard drive, from disk image backups I do regularly with Acronis. At least once a month I had to run a full restore because for some reason I'd start having problems with Windows 7, crashing or other various problems, and I'm not a newbie with Windows.Six months ago I bought a larger hard drive and installed \"Windows XP x64 Professional\" on the N61JQ-X1. Compatible 64 bit drivers were not hard to find. The XP 64-bit Pro works great compared to the OEM Windows 7, it's much better now with the XP-64.", "Date": "March 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop while it lasted, But failed after just 2 years", "Author": "utahcrazy", "ReviewID": "RTS8VPL1CAMWI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Liked this laptop while it lasted.

This was exactly what I was looking for.  With laptops, you always have a compromise ... power, weight, battery life, price, size, etc.  If any area is great, it is at the sacrifice of another.  I wanted the smallest laptop I could find (for portability) that offered the most power imaginable.  This was the first laptop with a monster i7 CPU, USB 3, under 17\", and a tough graphics card to handle my demand.I needed a portable machine that I could use to demo enterprise class systems.  I put the stock hard drive in an external USB 3.0 enclosure and dropped in a new SSD hard drive.  2 higher performing sticks for 8GB of total RAM found their way in as well.  Even running Windows Server with SQL Server, MOSS, Dynamics CRM, and multiple virtual machines, the boot time was wicked fast and tore up everything I could throw at it.  When the server powerhouse was no longer needed, Windows 7 Pro transformed it to a killer gaming rig dominating StarCraft II, SWTOR, & Diablo III all with maxed graphics.This much power comes with tradeoffs.  16\" is still heavy for transporting.  Maybe this is due to having to also lug a spare power cord to compensate for the very short battery life.  High power = high battery drain.  Period.  The i7 power goodness also generates a lot of heat; serious heat.  Enough to keep you warm in the winter.  The screen resolution was lower than I wanted but there was nothing on the market (or custom) with this processor or size that was better.

Within a couple of weeks she was complaining that it ran very hot and had very poor battery life. A few weeks after that the hard drive began to make funny sounds and then the computer would not boot. Tech support at ASUS said that she should send the computer in for service and that the turnaround would be more than a week. She did not have the luxury of not having a computer for that length of time as much of the course material was being presented online. She goes to school three hours away, so I drove to her school and switched out her computer for an older laptop that I had. I ordered a new hard drive, installed it and restored the computer to its original state, and I thought that was the end of it. But a few weeks later, the computer was freezing multiple times a day, and she had to reboot each time. She then informed me that she was so frustrated that she bought a MAC!I updated the drivers and removed all the software except the OS and it no longer \"froze\". I have been using this computer ever since with minimal software loaded at startup, and it seems to be working. I also use it to play DVDs and it does a good job of that. After a year of use, my comments are:It has a very short battery life, one hour at best..It does run hot which I attribute to the i7 processor and the fact that this is a laptop. As I write, the processor is 58 C or 136 F with very little running.The keyboard is very odd.

While writing this review, this has happened more than ten times!The computer is very fast.The computer is heavy and has a large footprint.In summary, it is a better desktop computer than a laptop.

As a college student, having my own system to tote around is far simpler than having to manage files on flash drives, uploading/downloading files, etc. I had been using an ASUS Eee 900 previously, but its processing power and hard drive space were quickly becoming limiting factors. I upgraded to this system at the beginning of October and have been very pleased. Being able to game between classes has been a plus as well.Those who obsess over playing games at the highest resolution with all settings at Ultra will be disappointed, but those people should know better than to be looking in this price range anyways. If you want to game with good framerates at something better than the lowest settings, you'll be pleased with this system. Running WoW, Starcraft II, TF2, BFBC2, and Mass Effect 2 at 1366*768 resolution with medium-to-high settings all produce capped framerates in normal situations and minimal framerate drops in more intense situations.Other notes in a few quick bullet points:PROS:- i7. They're so far ahead of anything else out there right now, buying anything that isn't an i3 or above seems almost like a waste of money.- Save for the lights on either side, fairly non-flashy case. Some might want the looks of the ASUS G-series. I like this as it's less of a target to be stolen and has a more professional look for use in the workplace.- Palm rests below the keyboard are rubberized. No more leaving palm imprints in cheap, coated plastic.- Numpad. Priceless when working in Excel during accounting courses. 0 key is slightly smaller to make room for the arrow keys, but you get used to it.- Does a very good job of keeping the system cool. The bottom of the case on the right side stays completely cool. The left side is slightly warm to the touch, but certainly still cool enough to place on your lap without it becoming uncomfortable. However, be aware of where you sit. If there's someone sitting to your left with their own computer, their mouse hand will get extremely hot as that is where your exhaust vent is.CONS:- Max screen resolution of 1366*768. Not an overly big deal for most productivity applications, but fonts can sometimes get squished in games.- Battery life. Don't expect to be gaming for hours without a power source nearby. Using the power options, turning down screen brightness, shutting off WiFi, and only running essential apps, I can get it to last through 2 hour lectures, but that's pushing it. Playing games unplugged will give you lower framerates than when on AC power, and will drain your battery dry in a matter of 30-40 minutes.- The two lights on the side. They're bright in a dark room, and they blink when the computer is put to sleep. If you're going to be keeping this in a bedroom, plan to shut it down at night.- Touchpad is just barely in position to be in contact with your left palm at homerow position. Non-issue for me, personally, since I shut off the touchpad and plug in a mouse. The Elantech software has a feature to detect and ignore input when it's your palm, but seems to need configuring and I haven't done so due to using a mouse.- Bloatware. You're not gonna find a computer from a manufacturer these days without it, though, so this is no surprise. ASUS's software tends to be more in the \"I don't need it\" category than the \"I don't want it, get it off now\" one. Apps to change the background image when the computer boots, automatically download and install drivers, 'more convenient' access to turn WiFi and Bluetooth on/off, etc...All gripes aside, you get what you pay for, and the biggest shortcoming of the screen and battery was something you should come in knowing about. A higher res screen almost always means a bigger screen, which adds more cost and weight. For me, this computer weighed in perfectly on both counts, since it was on sale for ~$800, making it a great buy.Currently, the next model in this series is on sale for $850. Only $50 more for a faster processor and a bigger HD. If only the semester had started two months later!

For the price alone, with a core i7 processor added with their warranty (which I hope I won't claim), no doubt that this is one of the most affordable units out there. It's not as stylish compared to others but looks are subjective, this unit appears to me, both elegant and contemporary. Besides, I didn'y buy this for it's looks but for it's power. Just read the specs and drool. It has a nice well-spaced chiclet keyboard(not lighted) which is comparative to a Vaio, lots of ports and connectors and the latest USB 3.0. Drawbacks that I encountered though which you will read also from other reviews are the low screen resolution which I really don't mind, besides that's what having an LED/LCD HDTV for; the vent on the side tends to get hot. I bought a fan for it though amazingly, the bottom part is cool; sensitive touch pad but I use an optical mouse so not really a concern.

Something that I was concern about when I bough it on-line was the color. On line is described as being a dark brown. It is dark brown but it is so dark that it looks black and in addition the pattern in the design is awesome. I bough mine at Costco on-line because they offer the best return policy that I know of and they had the best price I could find. I was tented to buy the ASUS G51 which has almost the same components and in addition better resolution for a bit more money but I am glad I pick the N61JQ-A1 because of the elegant look. The G51's design is just not cut out for the work environment because of its extravagant looks. The good thing is that the screen resolution has not been an issue for me when I play some games.

I did a lot of research on it before I decided to buy it, and this one seemed to fit all the requirement I want. The delivery itself was wonderful, it arrived two days before it said it would, and it is a good looking laptop. There is a lot of ASUS branded software on the computer, many would call it bloatware, but I find it useful. The Intel Core i7 processor is so fast that it uses up a lot less of the memory than most other processors would. The display and functions are really easy, it is like one click to turn off the bluetooth or the wireless, and one click to turn it back on. One thing I must warn is with the Express Gate. I had a lot of confusion with it, but I read the manual THROUGHLY, don't just skim through it like I did several times, and I found out that Express Gate only turns on when the computer is OFF. So that is something useful to know. Also, be cautious if you use the ASUS CopyProtect. Do not lock the CD-DVD Drive or the External storage drives (USB port) or else they will not appear on the computer. I had that confusion as well. The only bad things I could say about this computer may only be with my computer, but the computer display acted a little strange at first. When I first used it, I opened up the computer window and it said this computer had two hard drives. But when I had to restore the computer to it's factory condition (had nothing to do with the computer, it was all my fault) it was back to normal, saying it only had one. I still don't know what it meant, maybe it was just my computer. but I wouldn't consider that a deal breaker. Oh, and also, this computer runs HOT.I read that ASUS computers do, so I would get a good cooling pad with a fan or two, because it will help cool it down.....a bit.

The default drivers just won't do. Upgrade the drivers to the new 10.7 catalyst drivers right away and then if you are lucky it might not crash as often. I wouldn't blame this entirely on the graphics card since Starcraft 2 is have a multitude of problems with ATI graphics cards at the moment.Dragon Age Origins: Same with Starcraft 2 works but crashes from time to time. Make sure to upgrade your dragon age to the newest version and have the 10.7 drivers. I played this game for 5 hrs and it crashed about 3 times. ATI issues same with SC2.Mass Effect 2: Runs very smoothly. No Problems (but have heard on many forums this game had many issues with ATI cards.)Others:FN key not working. Volume/Mute Keys are not working. I had this problem at first but after updated with ATK drivers they worked fine.These are just a few of the problems I have personally encountered so far. Perhaps I just got a lemon iono, but after the updates to the drivers the problems seem to have either been fixed or lessened. In regards to the games. It might not necessarily be the notebook's fault, but just a few things to keep in mind.

Not great for the price, but good.Pros: has great sound, which is important to me. the SRS Premium Sound panel takes alot of playing with to get a good sound with whatever speakers you are using. I normally hate laptops mostly cause the mouse pads, but they copied Apple (in a good way) and made it so you can use 2 fingers anywhere on the pad and scroll instead of having a scroll bar on the side or whatever. I've found myself using other laptops and being confused by their lack of convenience. USB 3.0 makes transferring all my data alot easier and my phone and ipod charges super quick when i use the usb cable.Cons: only a few days after the 30-day zero bright dot warranty expired i found a few dead pixels, that strangely seem to come and go. the entire thing is very flimsy; the keyboard depresses quite a bit when typing and the screen flexes as if nothing is behind the screen giving it support. it comes with a TON of preloaded games and Asus software, some of which im afraid to uninstall for fear of messing up the OS or BIOS. Pay attention to where your pictures and music and things are saved, as the default path leads to the smaller \"OS\" partition and it will fill up very quickly. The mouse gets annoying and worn out fairly quick. Even with trying to adjust the sensitivity it either grabs on to an internet tab or something and wont let go or it has a hard time double clicking. The webcam is less than 1 mp, so dont expect to do anything other than take a (well-lit) picture with it. I tried video chatting with my sister and there was so much delay she could see me moving at all. It was basically just audio.This thing puts out ALOT of heat, especially if you're playing a game or exporting a video or something. Fan sometimes has a hard time keeping the system cool even with proper ventilation, and making the whole thing hot and burning your leg anyway. I've almost melted my glasses by leaving them on the left side of the computer (where the vent is). Also if youre doing something very processor taxing such as gaming or video editing, make sure the vent is very well exposed. I know thats kind of a no-brainer, but I was exporting a video and tried storing it away in my very large and open keyboard tray while it did its thing. I opened it up to find it had almost melted its own screen. there was a big air bubble that went away when i flexed the screen towards me (something you probably shouldnt be able to do). The screen has gotten air bubbles from having the lid closed while doing nothing more than a virus scan.So when it comes down to it, either look for a different model than this (N61JQ-A1) altho im pretty sure they dont make it anymore, or wait a month or 2 and you can get a much better system from any company with better specs for same price or less. BTW, the X1 is the same thing with a different hard drive size, so just keep that in mind.*UPDATE* Their customer service is HORRIBLE.

I thought I read somewhere that this thing got 10 hours! I looked over something there. 6)DVD drive just stopped working.

The vid card is only strong enough to run on medium settings of your games such the Street Fighter 4, but stronger than the xbox360's ATI GPU. The Ultimate settings on Starcraft 2 demands 1GB of the GPU ram, but it no longer runs at 60fps but very poor performance. You'll want to stay at medium for its 60-fps at the very high resolutions. This laptop GPU doesn't have a logic with going faster fresh rate of frames at a smaller resolution, only at the highest HD resolutions it attends to go faster at 60fps medium settings. The Street Fighter 4 medium settings hits it beautifully at 60fps with only the use of the GPU ram of 136mb.The CPU's FSB is a dream come true when it comes to the loading times with the solid state. It'll make the ram feels like 1666Mhz than it is originally 1066mhz.

I sent it in because of the severe keyboard clank and flex.  Web search for it and it's a known issue.  I was aware of the issue and was prepared to RMA the thing just because the specs were impressive.  I received the item back scratched up, hard drive cover not snapped in place properly and some extra added noise coming from the cpu area.  You would think that they would pay extra care to fix your laptop properly given the fact they clearly let down the customers expectations on quality control right?  To get a machine back in worse condition?  That's just not acceptable given what these things cost.So the N61JQ-X1 is a nice looking machine as everyone has stated.  I was trilled when I saw the beauty of the thing when I received it and it made up (not really) for my troubles.  The screen takes some getting used to but it's actually very nice.  The Elan Touchpad (not Synaptics) is much nice than the crap they threw on the N81VP (also known issue on the web).  There's a minor bit of keboard flex on the left side.  At this point I can live with it.Here's where it all breaks down again.  I loaded this thing with Windows 7 Ultimate N 64 and then reached for the included Driver's Disk.  The envelope did look a bit like someone handled before.  Loading it up I discovered the disk was completely empty.  4.7 GB free.  Nice going ASUS.  I went to the website to load the drivers.  All were confusingly there except the NEC USB 3.0 drivers.  foobar2.  A few days later I started hearing a loud and seriously annoying whine coming from the bottom edge of the laptop.  At times the high pitch sounds as though it resonates through the right hand side of the keyboard.  Swap  the hard drive out with another and still a sound.  I can barely stand using the laptop for 30 minutes as the whine is just so piercing as if you're ears are ringing.  And your ears continue to sound as if it's ringing long after you've turned off the machine.Asus, also take note.  The power plug on the left.  That's going to be an issue in the future.  I'm not sure anyone uses these plugs anymore.  Why is the pin side of the plug on the laptop side?  It should be on the power supply side in case they get bent and require replacing.

I sent it in because of the severe keyboard clank and flex.  Web search for it and it's a known issue.  I was aware of the issue and was prepared to RMA the thing just because the specs were impressive.  I received the item back scratched up, hard drive cover not snapped in place properly and some extra added noise coming from the cpu area.  You would think that they would pay extra care to fix your laptop properly given the fact they clearly let down the customers expectations on quality control right?  To get a machine back in worse condition?  That's just not acceptable given what these things cost.So the N61JQ-X1 is a nice looking machine as everyone has stated.  I was trilled when I saw the beauty of the thing when I received it and it made up (not really) for my troubles.  The screen takes some getting used to but it's actually very nice.  The Elan Touchpad (not Synaptics) is much nice than the crap they threw on the N81VP (also known issue on the web).  There's a minor bit of keboard flex on the left side.  At this point I can live with it.Here's where it all breaks down again.  I loaded this thing with Windows 7 Ultimate N 64 and then reached for the included Driver's Disk.  The envelope did look a bit like someone handled before.  Loading it up I discovered the disk was completely empty.  4.7 GB free.  Nice going ASUS.  I went to the website to load the drivers.  All were confusingly there except the NEC USB 3.0 drivers.  foobar2.  A few days later I started hearing a loud and seriously annoying whine coming from the bottom edge of the laptop.  At times the high pitch sounds as though it resonates through the right hand side of the keyboard.  Swap  the hard drive out with another and still a sound.  I can barely stand using the laptop for 30 minutes as the whine is just so piercing as if you're ears are ringing.  And your ears continue to sound as if it's ringing long after you've turned off the machine.Asus, also take note.  The power plug on the left.  That's going to be an issue in the future.  I'm not sure anyone uses these plugs anymore.  Why is the pin side of the plug on the laptop side?  It should be on the power supply side in case they get bent and require replacing.
