I bought it for school, gaming and digital artwork(Photoshop and whatnot). It's not totally silent, but it's not really loud either. The only time the fan runs a lot is during gaming as it does heat up quickly, but I assume that's normal for a laptop when gaming. I plan to buy a cooling pad so it doesn't die. I haven't tested how it well plays many games yet. So far I've just played Everquest Landmark's open beta and Minecraft, it could play Landmark smoothly on medium settings, but was laggy on high. I don't know if this is normal or not since I unfortunately don't know a whole lot about the graphics card aside from Nvidia GTX cards are gaming cards and 860M should be good. The colorful backlit keyboard is a plus, very nice.The only con so far is Windows 8, I just don't really like it, and using a track pad with Windows 8 is such a huge pain, stuff pops up randomly just from my palm touching it while I'm typing. So I plugged a mouse in to use instead.Before this laptop I had bought an Asus from Best Buy that was around $1000, but it couldn't even play Minecraft so I returned it. So glad I did and got this one instead. I plan to update the review later if anything bad happens.Update 4/20/14I started having some problems this week similar to that other reviewer, the laptop won't stay connected to the wifi or the browser starts loading incredibly slow. I attempted to fix the problem but nothing has worked so far. The only thing that puts the computer back to normal temporarily is restarting. Considering returning it if I can't solve the problem soon.Update 4/23/14Couldn't fix it, returning it.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "exactly what I purchased", "Author": "Jeremiah", "ReviewID": "R284Y9YUR34GO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "No gripes about this laptop.
