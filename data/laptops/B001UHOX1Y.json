Pommerenck \"the geek oracle\"", "ReviewID": "R2CXX3B4GXYDEP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I believe that this laptop will provide some of you with exactly what you want, not a netbook with a 10\" screen, but not a heavy laptop with a 15\" screen.This is in between.Honestly, I love the laptop, I set mine up to dual boot the Windows Vista, and I installed Windows 7 on the other drive partition.  Thankfully, 320GB is plenty of hard drive for two operating systems.The HP Entertainment PC software features make it very easy for anyone to stream TV, radio, and etc. without a degree in it!!!The only flaw = I do not like the keyboard.  I do not like the shape of the keys (curvature), I do not like the color (all black and the letters are very hard to read in low light conditions), and I do not like the finish of the keyboard (too slick).Other than that, it does run hot, but what high performing laptop doesn't???  My first tablet was a Fujitsu Lifebook T4020D, and its Pentium M 2.0 Ghz cpu would actually burn your skin if you let it.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lasted 5 years", "Author": "Rico", "ReviewID": "R3S83THZS6MN5S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this computer in 2009/2010 I believe. Never had a problem with it until recently, the screen has broke. When I turn it on everything is green. And that is probably from leaving it in the car on a hot day. Its lightweight and perfect for school. The speed is OK and can handle simple workload, not gaming though.Since the screen broke I may just connect it to my TV via HDMI and use it as a desktop since only the monitor is broken. Definitely got my money's worth out of it ($450 in '09) in 5 years time.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Substandard product. Use your money on something more practical (like 600 bags of Skittles)", "Author": "Books_n_stuff", "ReviewID": "R10YNBSFKQAZUK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It pains me to write this review just from the memories and heartache this laptop produced. 1 star is being overly generous for a product that is substandard and from a company that produces the worst quality laptops one could ever imagine. I mean seriously, $600 is a lot of money to fork out for a product that literally falls apart in your hands. Okay, I'm exaggerating. But not by much. What a piece of junk! I had this laptop for a year and with normal use, the color wore off, the keyboard keys deteriorated and the letters wore off, the fake chrome sides wore off, and marks started to appear all over even though I -religiously- stowed the darn thing in an ultra padded carrying case any time I took it out of the house.Don't even get me started of the charging cord. HP has the cheapest of cheapy charging cables. They wear out in months and just aren't designed to be rolled up all the time. I had to order 3 of the friggen things in the  ridiculously short lifespan of the product. I will never buy an HP product. This was product number 2. All I have to say is between the two HP laptops I owned, HP is pretty consistent with the substandard materials it employs, the flimsy charging cables and overall poor quality and design. The reviews speak for themselves. I never buy a product that has an average rating of 3 stars. Eventually the laptop just stopped turning on. Why? I have no clue. All I know is I've learned my lesson. I am not even going to bother to fix it. It's just not worth it. It's junk. Garbage. Waste of money. Buy something that actually works and will last. This laptop on the other hand, will only bring you heartache, disappointment and suffering. That's my two cents. I hope I can save some poor soul out there from enduring the pain and suffering I went through with HP's poor, substandard laptops.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Durable and slim", "Author": "Alexandre K.

Winzenried", "ReviewID": "R2HQ191P59SGJF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered a laptop from this seller. It was classified as in \"very good\" condition. The tracking on it didnt work, but i really didnt mind that too much. It came with a nice case and charger, external disc drive, mouse, etc.. honestly, it was more than i was expecting. Then i tried to use the laptop itself.. yeah, no bueno.The laptop had partitions set on the 300gb hardrive so that you could only access 12gbs of the computer. Basically, the computer had less memory available on it than my ipod nano. I probably could have worked around that, but 12gbs of memory isnt even enough space to download windows vista onto the computer, so my computer couldnt even function. Long story short, he sold me a crap laptop that didnt work.Lucky me, i have a genius roommate that is really tech savvy, and a week later, with hours of research, we found a way to access my computer with an external disc drive operating system that allowed us to reset the partitions on my laptop. We considered wiping my computer completely and reinstall vista, but the Product Key for vista was RUBBED OFF! So if we reset the computer, i would have had to spend another $200 on a new operating system.All in all, it's a nice laptop. The condition it was in? yeah, im pretty sure he didnt take a second look at it before he put it up for sale. Lesson learned: See your product in person, because people online will take advantage of you if they get the chance.----the only reason i gave it a two is because it shipped pretty quickly, and it came with a bunch of stuff i didnt know about.
