{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great little laptop", "Author": "M. Svensson \"MSven\"", "ReviewID": "R437H1R1TZNN1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for about a week and am very happy with it.  I am not a Windows 8 fan, so installed 7 on it instead and have had very few problems since the \"downgrade\" except for some USB driver issues (use the ones from Window's \"Search Automatically\" function and you'll be good) and the communication hot key doesn't work.  Also, I had to turn off UEFI (using Legacy instead) due to the RAID configuration, using 2 x 128GB drives.Pros:  - Small, but good performance  - So far, battery life has been pretty good, especially if you use a darker display brightness setting (I'll try to get actual figures soon on battery life under \"normal\" use)  - Comes with a nice case (though it doesn't have a slot for the included VGA/Ethernet adapter, if I'm being critical)Cons:  - If you can call it a 'con,' the full 1920x1080 setting makes things very small for my taste.  I had to drop it to 1600x900 to have the desktop icons set at a readable size.  People with worse vision might want even lower...  - They keyboard layout is a little goofy (Fn key required for home, end, function keys...) but that's the price you pay for a small laptop.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E4XT26M"}}
