But it's a winner. Great screen, speakers,keyboard,webcam,very easy to set up. Windows 7 is a snap to use. (I've been using Vista, before that XP Pro and XP.)The laptop comes with 4gb of ram. I ordered two 4gb. to increase the ram to 8gb. I found the upgrade here on Amazon for only $29. That's cheap enough. I would recommend Acer to anyone that wants a good computer that doesn't cost a lot of money.", "Date": "November 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best value at $379.", "Author": "mralan", "ReviewID": "R3LD34H1YE97A8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After looking at laptops for several months I finally settled on this little beauty. This is my first laptop and I have fallen in love with it. I wanted a machine to use \"Push 2 TV\" with and kiss my cable bill goodbye and I did just that. Life is good! Caught this Acer on sale at Micro Center for $379 and I couldn't be happier. If you're thinking about this one, get it. You won't be sorry especially at $379.", "Date": "December 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Deal", "Author": "southieshamrock", "ReviewID": "R2ZWSQ8BMCVCOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop a year ago. My laptop died and I needed a new one quick. Money was tight and so I shopped around(big box stores, online, etc...) and I kept coming back to this one. I love this computer it exceeded my expectations. I waited a year to review because I feel this is the best way to measure how well an electronic device works. It's easy to write a good review 3 days after you bought something when it is still shiny new. This laptop took a beating and still runs prefect, not one issue. I use it for work and school everyday for at least three hours at a time. Acer makes a great product at a great price. Don't let the low price fool you this was well worth the $500. I ran ArcGIS 9.3 (full version)right out of the box no problem. I also used it for class on 3d game design and 3d online worlds, not one hiccup.I bought this as a cheap stop gap measure to get me by till I got a better laptop and never traded-up.Buy This laptop.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Good", "Author": "ricosdi2000", "ReviewID": "R1BQQUOZAQD8Y5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very nice laptop.

This is a no-nonsense, good bang-for-your-buck machine with lots of RAM and storage (hard drive) space. It's no gaming computer but it is serving our purposes well; light photo editing, word processing, web surfing, email, etc. The wireless connection works flawlessly. It did not come loaded with a bunch of \"trialware\" and \"crapware\" that gets in your way and usually has to be uninstalled. It has a decent size screen without being too big and is good for watching DVDs.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sufficiently good power at a very reasonable price", "Author": "CallMeBond", "ReviewID": "RHQMYW53KOPU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop as a secondary laptop for my family as I have my work and personal laptops already. Shipment arrived before promised date and packaging was done very well. I liked the glossy deep black look though it attracts a lot of lint/dust and it is not very bulky for it's size. It took me less than 30 min to light it up and was not loaded with a lot of junk software. It took some effort to install printer driver, as \"Add Printer\" did not give me an option to load the driver from CD so I had to do minimal install of HP printer software. I was able to connect with my TV and Home Theater Receiver using HDMI as this laptop will be used a lot for this purpose and was a main factor for buying this. It's body has a feel of plastic case and needs to be handled with a bit of caution. Multi-touch mouse pad is also not very responsive to be best in class but not a big deal for me. I am curious about WI-DI feature which I am not able to explore now but intend to at some point of time. I am not able to find any negative with laptop in 2-3 days of my ownership and quite like the screen size/display quality. I bought it at a deal price and it is totally worth it.", "Date": "December 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing for the price", "Author": "William B. Partridge", "ReviewID": "R3R910X7QA64PO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I picked this laptop up for $400 on Amazon as a gift for my mom.  I spent a few hours setting it up for her before hand and I have to say for the price I'm really impressed.  Things could be better - namely the screen isn't very good, it gets washed out very easily, but it's not terrible.As long as you set your expectations accordingly you'll be very happy with it.  As stated, the screen isn't great, there's no backlit keyboard, and specs aren't blazing fast but that's not really something you can expect in a laptop under $500.  What it does offer that a lot of others don't is USB 3.0 (most will have only 2.0), Intel Core i3 (most will have either Pentium D or AMD) or Intel WiDi.  It's really impressive to find that in a laptop so cheap.  To really improve the problem specs (screen namely, maybe hard drive speed/size) the laptop would likely have to cost double.All in all, very pleased.  Acer bloatware was minimal and easily removed too.  I probably had it all cleaned off and installed with the software she'd need in under 2 hours.", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "After 1 year I'm pretty happy", "Author": "Bethesda Dad \"Happy retiree\"", "ReviewID": "R1T2J1J22X3U62", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had a couple of issues with this laptop that originally made me rate it at one star. But these problems were resolved very satisfactorily. Now, maybe, there shouldn't be any problems, but I did pay a lot less for the features and computing power of this  laptop. In any case, Acer was really excellent in handling the bigger problem (a noisy fan) which I didn't report to them until the last two weeks of the one year warranty. They fixed it, cleaned up the computer, updated the CMOS, and it works better than ever! I'm happy with it and am happy to give it 4 stars.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "virginiason", "ReviewID": "R1QCTGY3OD5TJ7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a new laptop since my HP crapped out on me (1 1/2 old). I do a lot of video streaming and multitask a lot so I need a lot of power and ram. Also I didn't want to buy another HP. I looked for days for the perfect one at my price point. I saw this one and kept coming back to it. It's high powered, intel i3 inside, large hard drive, HDMI port, 2 usb 2.0 and 1 usb 3.0, HD web camera, lcd display (which is beautiful). Overall I am really pleased with this purchase. I've only had about 5 or 6 weeks so I'm still learning new things about it. Will update after another month or so. Anyone looking for a new laptop really should look long and hard at this one, just saying.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very satisfied, good buy for the money", "Author": "Turley Hayes", "ReviewID": "R37KA9OFMNXANU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have now had this laptop for over 6 months. I bought it to replace a very powerful HP desktop that dodn't allow me to have it where I wanted it.  This Acer has exceeded all of my expectations.  I would have given it 5 stars but for the fact that the Intel wireless display did not work as good as I thought it should have.  This is probably due to interference frm cell phone, wireless phones, and other wireless traffic in my house.  It would loose conection frequently.  However, with the fact that the Acer has an HDMI port on it, I wired it directly to my 46\" Sony Bravia (bought from Amazon) and solved my problem.  I have had absolutely no trouble with performance.  I did upgrade it, purely for my desire to improve its already great performance.  I added another 4 GB of memory and replaced the hard drive with a Seagate hybrid drive that has both Solid State and a 7200 rpm spinning drive.  Now this little screamer boots up in less than a minute and response time has nearly tripled.  If you want an affordable, easily configurable and not spned a great deal of money an Acer laptop is for you.", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very pleased.", "Author": "Dynamic Six", "ReviewID": "R1TD9YPTNYXI75", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ordered this machine from Microsoft Store 10 days ago for 350 bones because my Lenovo Ideapad Y450 has died a miserable death. I was originally somewhat hesitant about purchasing an Acer since I have heard many mixed reviews, but an i3 chip, USB 3, 500 GB hard drive, and 4 GB of RAM; it was hard to pass on.My previous Lenovo had a whole book of problems including overheating (sudden shut down), awkwardly positioned headphone jack, flimsy touchpad keys, and white spots on display so these are the improvements I was looking for in addition to a decent processor, good key board, clear display, and weight. And I must say at this point, I'm very pleased with this laptop. It has been a breeze setting up, lighting fast USB 3.0, crystal clear 15.6 inch display, very thin profile, completely quiet, very little excess heat, and it came with zero bloatware (gasp)! Even after 2 and half hours of heavy computing and 120 GB of file transferring, it still had 25% of power left to spare. Granted it doesn't provide over 10 hours of battery life such as Asus U series or a Macbook, it also only cost 1/3 of those other machines and just as fast.I highly recommend this laptop.", "Date": "February 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Grand daughters lap top", "Author": "POP \"Jim\"", "ReviewID": "RAN67LMCH346T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was worth the money and she is enjoying it so much thank you.

I purchased it because I needed a bed rest after an operation and couldn't sit and work at my desktop computer. I am basically happy with it, the mouse is easy to operate, the keyboard is good, nice speakers, it's fast, has MS Word preloaded - just what I need. I can also read books while lying in bed. I also bought a lapdesk so that computer won't overheat. Otherwise it would be very dangerous to keep computer on the bed, as it doesn't allow ventilation and the laptop can easily overheat and catch fire. Before you turn the laptop off, disconnect the lapdesk, so that it won't freeze.", "Date": "January 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bang for Buck!!!", "Author": "roryrudy", "ReviewID": "R15WFEHAIBO9Q4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Laptop came in very good condition as described.
