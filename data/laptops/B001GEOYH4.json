{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It's a good laptop", "Author": "Mikey Mike \"Zoom Lover\"", "ReviewID": "R2T2ODRIBYV8J2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought mine in August 2008. It comes with Vista 64-bit but I found that some programs I wanted to install would not so I installed Vista 32-bit (CD & instructions were included when I bought mine). It does not have a S-video outlet(I miss it). I have not figured out how to connect it to my TV yet without S-video. After changing from 64-bit to 32-bit I had some minor issues reinstalling the drivers. I had to call GATEWAY SUPPORT. My problem was taken care of. I recently noticed that when I use any equalizer on any music player (Win. I-Tunes. Jet Audio etc) the music level goes down instead of up when I increase the settings. WEIRD!! I'm in the process of trying to fix that bug. The lay out of the KEY BOARD is not standard. The ENTER & BACKSPACE buttons are smaller than usual and I keep hitting the buttons next to them. The CTRL & ALT buttons are not where I'm used to having them on other boards. It has a 3-pronged power cord so make sure your outlets are 3-pronged receptables. It could be a problem when traveling on the road. Other than that I have no other problems with it.I love this laptop. It's very fast, graphics are crisp, resolution is great. Not too heavy just ove 6.3 lbs. This is also my first year using VISTA so some of it has to do with the difference between VISTA & XP.I recomend this laptop but if you change from 64 bit to 32 bit be prepared for some WTF momments. Oh by the way I tried to put XP on it but GATEWAY says they do not support XP on it. I could not get XP to install.I guess if I was a geek I could find ways around it.", "Date": "January 19, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001GEOYH4"}}
