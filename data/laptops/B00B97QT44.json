Great laptop.  Fast and reliable so far.  Windows 8 has been getting a lot of bad reviews and users don't like it.  It is different than the earlier versions but is geared more towards the apps like a tablet or xbox.  I enjoy it and since I am more comfortable with it i find it easier than the other windows products I have used all the way back to the dos version.", "Date": "April 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review Refurbished", "Author": "Lexxie2004", "ReviewID": "R3VV3Y9K85DVJG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought Refurbished from Sold by Computer Geeks here on Amazon and paid a little under $500. I waited to do my review on this product for 3 months to make sure I could give it a more accurate review and not just an out of the box review.Out of the box, my refurbished pink Dell laptop was even more stunning in person. It looked brand new on the outside. It was a plug and play for me, so it was easy to get started. Beware, it does come with the new Windows installed. For a person like me that knows nothing about \"apps\" even being under 30 I just don't get this new Windows. So, anything that requires using the mouse I have to be careful or it goes to other screens. Makes gaming difficult.Moving forward, after 1 month of use I tried to burn 2 cds. This laptop produces cd's with skips here and there. Not good. After 3 months of use, I have to turn my laptop on twice to make the screen go past the Dell icon with the black screen. The first time I turn it on it says Dell, then just goes to a black screen. Meaning, no icons or anything.I still like it like a used car.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful", "Author": "Kelsey", "ReviewID": "R1RD9IMJO9YWO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Aesthetically pleasing, runs with grace and speed, great specifications. Windows 8 is certainly different, but, you adapt to it with time. The webcam on this computer is spectacular as is the microphone.
