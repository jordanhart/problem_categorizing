{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not good, even at a low price", "Author": "Cas Walker", "ReviewID": "RETBD4PVAS6TH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My first day working on the NP355E5C and it's not as slow as I feared it would be. It has a low end AMD processor so I was worried it would be annoyingly slow to use. So far I've installed Windows updates and ClassicShell to make Windows 8 usable and performance has been ok.The 5400rpm 500GB Hitachi hard drive with 8MB cache is a pretty standard part for inexpensive laptops and it's kinda slow. If this was my daily use computer I'd be tempted to upgrade it to an SSD drive.I was surprised such an inexpensive PC has Realtek gigabit for wired ethernet and it has bluetooth in addition to two USB 3 ports and two USB 2 ports. That's better connectivity options than other low end laptops.The screen is bright and clear. I'm not a touch typist but the keyboard is working well for me.The trackpad has frequently quit tracking my finger until I lift off and put my finger back down. I've not found any setting in the control panel that helps.Update 04mar13: I'd hoped I could find a way to add Windows7 but this laptop uses \"Secure Boot\" making it difficult and expensive to get Windows 7 installed. It looks like I would have to turn off Secure Boot then reformat the hard drive and reinstall Windows7 from scratch with a retail Win 7 disk. It appears I would then loose the ability to use the provided Windows8 installation. Think I'm stuck with Win8. I'm using Classic Shell to help make Win8 more usable. That makes it pretty much like Win7 but still a little weird. On the upside, every program and tweak I use in Win7 is working in Win8 so that's cool. I'm still having the problem where the trackpad stops responding until I lift my finger. I'm getting used to doing that but I hope someday a driver update will help with that issue.Update 08jul13: Downgraded from 4 stars to 1 star. I've given up on this thing. The trackpad has never tracked right. I tried driver updates & setting changes but cannot get it to work smoothly. I have to use a mouse. Then one day the screen went solid white then solid black. I could only see the desktop when I plugged in an external monitor. I called Samsung and set up a warranty service return to get the screen fixed but after a few days and many reboots the screen started working again so I had to cancel the return. The screen has worked perfectly ever since but I no longer trust this laptop to be reliable for travel. This past week I noticed the CPU is always working at half speed, .8GHz instead of 1.7GHz. Turns out the power plan keeps reverting to the Power Saver plan after I set it to the Performance plan. I can't find a way to get the Performance power plan setting to stick.I like Samsung, they make a lot of price/performance winning stuff. I wanted to like this laptop, but with the poorly performing trackpad, the unreliable screen, & the CPU speed issue, this laptop is just too frustrating.UPDATE September 2013:I've now sent this thing in for repair three times. First for blank screen, erratic trackpad, and camera not working. They fixed the screen and sent it back with the camera & trackpad problems. So I sent it in a second time and again they fixed only one problem, the camera, and sent it back to me. Now its in for service a third time and hopefully they'll fix the trackpad this time.They are fixing the problems but its been a slow frustrating experience.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Seems perfect", "Author": "Devrie K.

Fortunately paid only $249.00 new.Replaced my Toshiba Vista laptop.Well, Windows 8 is awful.  But that has nothing to do with this laptop (I think).This laptop is a bottom budget laptop and it really shows.All of the components are minimal or marginal.  It is a laptop.  That's it.Reading up on the CPU apparently the Intel Celeron is a better CPU then this AMD in this Samsung laptop.This Samsung laptop is slow and clunky.  I use cable broadband from two different companies in two different states. No, not at the same time.Actually got a new router and broadband modem at one place as I thought issues might be there.  No it is this laptop.Got a black screen once and nothing I could do would get the screen to show up.  Finally after multiple attempts manual on/off unplug etc.  did get screen back.  This has never happened with my previous 3 laptops. Different brands.This laptop does have a good amount of RAM and an HDMI port.I have had this laptop for over a year now.  Only use rarely but for long periods of time when I do.I can't recommend this laptop.I actually reformatted the hard drive (back to out of box) as I thought maybe some software I had on this was causing issues.Note:  For those looking for the reformat disk - it is not there.  The reformat is built into the software of this Samsung laptop. No disk required.  All in on the software built into this Samsung laptop.I will dump this laptop once Microsoft comes out with Windows 9 or whatever the next full version is. I will make sure to check the processor before purchasing any low end laptop.  My last laptop was a low end Toshiba and that worked better then this newer Samsung with same internet connections and mostly same programs.Take a step up and skip over this Samsung and this AMD processor.Samsung missed the boat with this laptop and Samsung has tarnished it's reputation.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Review still in progess", "Author": "say2juicy", "ReviewID": "R3R8H1B6HR38A7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a good product so far.

The DVD somehow became stuck in the laptop and was so well hidden that my husband kept insisting that there was no DVD stuck in there. We have since got the DVD out. Needless to say, it will not play DVDs. I had only had the laptop for 3 months before the disk drive gave out.Something that also bothers me about this laptop is that it loses wireless connectivity or does not even pick up the signal while other computers right next to me are able to. It is also terribly slow. I also TRULY dislike the operating system which is Windows 8. Every time Windows comes out with a new operating system, I read that people do not like it but I usually do not have any problems with new operating systems. THIS time, I DO have a problem with windows 8. I still do not understand how to use the system and am so frustrated by it. If Amazon replaces my laptop, I plan on having a computer person change it to Windows 7.****UPDATE February 10, 2014I contacted Samsung and am in the process of returning the laptop as it no longer turns on. I have to pay the shipping costs to get it to Samsung but they, supposedly, pay for the shipping to return it, or its replacement, back to me.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "too busy doing needless items to be a computer!", "Author": "Z.

This computer is slower so if you want it for business purposes you may want a faster processor and more memory but for an everyday laptop computer this one meets all the requirements!  also in WIN 8 it is so much  easier to install and uninstall programs and apps than in WIN7!
