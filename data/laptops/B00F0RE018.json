I love the feel of this computer. The keyboard is really easy to type on, even though the keys aren't backlit. One main reason I bought this was the SonicMaster sound system and number pad because I do a lot of math on my keyboard. The sound is incredible at all volume levels. It's really lightweight which is really nice for portability. If you're looking for a mid-sized laptop with great sound quality, I highly recommend this one. I was going to buy the older version, but instead paid an extra $50 for a newer generation i5 processor. The battery is also great for everything this computer is built to do. A small, yet somewhat convenient thing about this laptop is that the charger is a 2-prong, just in case you don't have any 3-prong outlets like I don't at my apartment.The only downfall about this computer is Windows 8, but that's basically a given.NOTE: If you plan on putting Linux on this computer, be sure to install a grub boot installer. The BIOS for this computer doesn't have grub. Instead it uses UEFI. You'll also have to adjust the boot settings to get it to read the ODD. Other than that, getting it installed is fine.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT LAPTOP... GREAT COST", "Author": "Renay Lindsay", "ReviewID": "R39SKLKHHHY9WZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am really pleased with this laptop. Was a little hesitant at first since I've never purchased anything from ASUS before but I heard it was a great brand so decided to give it a try. I must say everything it proclaims to do it does... the i5 processor is really fast, camera works great, watching videos and movies on it is awesome due to it's HD quality and I'm just crazy about the sonic master speaker system (in other words the sound is phenomenal). It's a slim, sleek beautiful laptop, love it's design. It actually turns on in 2 seconds which i found was a little unbelievable at first when i read it but it's TRUE. It never overheats no matter how long it's been running, it's IceCool. I felt as if i won the lotto finding a laptop with great specs as this for this price. Windows 8 however is a pain but it's just a matter of getting use to.Overall I Love this laptop. I would DEFINITELY recommend it :)", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "I really don't understand why this has such a bad rating", "Author": "Raphael Castaneda", "ReviewID": "R1NW65A5FIB1ZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I thought this laptop was pretty dang good. Maybe because it was better than my old laptop, an HP G6 that was horrid. I'm pretty okay with Windows 8, and all I had to do was get used to the new alien OS. It's light for its size (then again, my G6 was pretty thick) and its drives contain 1TB of hard drive space, no less. It stays cool.  I occasionally play Minecraft, which I have modded into oblivion, and it STILL stays relatively cold. For people with \"streaming issues,\" I'm pretty sure it's your crap-tastic WiFi / Intenet connection, and you shouldn't blame it on the machine. The boot up is pretty fast for me, and I can start using the internet within 10-15 seconds. (Old one took 90-210 secs). Like most reviews, the sound system, the SonicMaster is a dream. Very clear audio. I never got prompts from Windows to install MSN or whatever, and the only \"unknown\" software it had pre installed were some Asus apps and features, so I don't know how someone got that problem. The buttons worked for me. Maybe some people didn't press the \"fn\" or \"function\" button before they pressed the function keys, which have more than one purpose, for example, f11 gave me fullscreen while just tapping it, but fn+f11 brought the volume down. Only issue I have with it is that the mousepad's clicker is also part of the mousepad, so if you brush the clicker, it also moves the mouse, but this issue is only personal preference. In all, I'm VERY happy with my new laptop and I would recommend it to others. To the people who had some nightmarish problems, maybe you just got a defective product or something, because I'm living a happy life with this.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT VALUE", "Author": "Reese S. Rickards", "ReviewID": "R2M75FSVT32HD4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My high tech adviser recommended three brands before I purchased, Asus one of them.  It replaces a 6 or 7 year old HP laptop.  I chose the Asus because it is one of the very few laptops still offering an optical drive.  Buyers of any brand should not assume they'll be able to load programs from CDs, burn discs, or watch DVDs when they order.  Look carefully at the photo of the product on the Amazon pages to make certain there is an optical drive shown.After using this new machine for a couple weeks I find the hardware friendly and easy to use.  How well it stands up to my relatively light use will be apparently in 6 months or a year.Now, buyers of new computers like this should know in advance they will be getting the Windows 8 operating system.  Note; 8 and not 8.1 which fixes some of the gremlins in the initial release.  Microsoft offers new buyers a free download of 8.1, but not without a ton of downloading.First, the owner has to go online and download all the updates for Windows 8.  (My machine needed about 5 hours to complete the task.)  Then, and only then, can you go to the app store and begin another long download of Windows 8.1.  But be prepared, these latest versions of the Windows OS is nothing like recent MS operating systems.  Think smart phone and pad.  The Asus I purchased does not have a touch screen, largely because I like a mouse.Overall, this seems to be a topnotch computer but remember that after delivery you have to go through the tangled briars of Windows 8.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great For the $$$", "Author": "David A.

They are always high quality and they work nearly perfectly. I play lots of games like Skyrim, Fallout, Assassin's Creed and Mass Effect etc., and they all run perfectly on this computer! One of the best features is the cooling system  mostly because it actually works but also because it works amazingly well. I can have this laptop plugged in and running multiple apps the entire day and it never heats up. The only time it did heat up (very minimally) was when I used it on my bed on top of the comforter with nothing separating it. I work from home so this is a huge plus for me! The sound quality is outstanding and I love how you can set the audio for what you are doing i.e, music, gaming, movies, etc. The sound is crisp and clean and the gaming option makes the audio in games very robust. The webcam works excellent as well, very good quality. My one and only complaint about this machine is that it has Windows 8 on it. For those of you who do not know this Windows 8 is absolutely terrible. 100% not user friendly, the updates take forever and make you set everything up all over again and go through quite a lengthy process just to be able to use the computer. Windows 8 is brought to us by the same idiots that created Windows Vista, and we all know what an atrocity that was. It takes some getting used to and at first Windows 8 is very very frustrating. The shipping was also great .It arrived 1 day early with no damage. All in all this computer is pretty rad. If you game, work from home or just want to watch movies on it, it will perform admirably nearly every time. I could not have asked for a better laptop at this price. WELL worth the price!!!

Maheshwari", "ReviewID": "R1BTE997ARC1PV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop in Dec 2013 to replace a 5-year old Sony Vaio which had started to show age. I wanted a 15\" laptop with a fast processor, 8 GB RAM, good battery life, and as lightweight as possible. This ASUS laptop fit the bill and seemed like a good deal at just under $650. My biggest shock was using Windows 8. I had Windows Vista on my Sony Vaio and had no idea how drastically Microsoft had changed Windows (for the worse!). Upgrading to Windows 8.1 didn't help either and I would curse Microsoft every time I used the ASUS laptop. Unfortunately, I had to have Windows for iTunes to work with iPhone5s. I finally took the plunge and was able to successfully do a clean installation of Windows 7 after countless hours of tweaking and research. This laptop has UEFI instead of BIOS which makes things very difficult. To install any other OS you have to first disable Fast Boot, enable CSM and Turn Secure Boot off in the BIOS/UEFI which can be accessed by pressing F2 key. I chose to completely wipe off Windows 8.1 and the various recovery partitions and re-partitioned the hard drive for a clean install. Windows Update was able to get most of the drivers, for the missing ones I went to ASUS site and downloaded them. You can install Ubuntu in a similar fashion. I was able to install Ubuntu 14.04 in the UEFI mode (dual boot configuration) from a LiveUSB with gpt partition.Cons: The touchpad on this laptop is horrible, there is no way to adjust the scrolling speed via ASUS Smart Gesture. It comes with a lot of useless software pre-installed by ASUS (also called bloat ware) which was the reason why I had to do a clean install. I am not too happy with the resolution on this system, max resolution is 1366 x 768, something thatI should have paid more attention to before I bought this laptop.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for small business", "Author": "David Weller", "ReviewID": "RLYXE8IAUEMNU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Has everything you need to handle any business needs... to include the processing power for heavy applications and web graphics...", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "A good product", "Author": "Delores P.", "ReviewID": "R2L9I7M6G0PIEN", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The product is nice thin and light.I chose the black laptop but finger print stains still appear on cover and are not easy to wipe off.The charger when it's plugged into an outlet does not stay in.
