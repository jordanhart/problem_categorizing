Unreliable.", "Author": "Steve G", "ReviewID": "RY0Y9W2TKQBPU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned/used more than 4 of these computers. Every single one has had a major hardware failure within 6 months. This laptop is actually worse than HP's from a few years ago (if possible). The volume control doesn't even work. The case is flimsy and will crack easily. Hard drive fails and thrashes constantly. Screen resolution constantly reverting back to lowest setting. VOIP microphone only works when plugged directly into the laptop (won't work when plugged into the dock). Avoid this computer if you can.", "Date": "August 31, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Offers the smart balance of mobility and performance in a thin, light, stylish design\nIt is meant for the professional who needs powerful computing, mobility and enhanced security in a reliable notebook\nUsers will appreciate being able to take their office on the road without sacrificing performance, productivity or convenience\nIt is the ideal choice for enterprise-wide deployment to mainstream mobile users", "Name": "Laptop HP Compaq NC6230", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519aTzu%2BAuL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0007XHNO6"}}
