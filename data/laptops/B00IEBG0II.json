Gallagher", "ReviewID": "R2Q9OJ4VFAB5RQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Perhaps I should start by saying that every laptop I've ever owned has been a Toshiba, so I'm not exactly well-versed in the merits, or lack thereof, of the competition. I liked the first one I owned and it served me well, so I decided to stick with a winner.This latest version has not disappointed me. Even the dreaded Windows 8 hasn't been a big problem for me. I must, however, agree with the other reviewers who have said that the audio sucks. I didn't think I would care about that, but then I tried to use it to watch TV, and discovered that it really can be annoying. And external speakers aren't really a good option for a computer that's supposed to be portable. I haven't tried using headphones or ear buds. Maybe that would be a viable solution.To sum up, the C55-A5182 is a good, solid machine for the kind of work I do (mostly writing), so overall I'm quite happy with it. It's sleek and beautiful and fast. Just don't try to listen to music or watch a movie.", "Date": "April 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "A GREAT LAPTOP", "Author": "CAROLYN T.

Choike Jr.", "ReviewID": "R33FDXEKNAAC94", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's hard for me to write this review because I really liked my last Toshiba laptop a L755 w/pentium b chip. It's hard drive died  and I lost windows 7 and all my data, This is MY FAULT though because it warned me and I tried to see how long it would last kind of like Kramer on Seinfeld trying to see how far he could go past E on his gas gauge. Make sure you make your back up and recovery discs folks 'cause now I have to pay $30s/h which is OUTRAGEOUS to Toshiba for new ones.So being the type of guy who likes the opportunity to upgrade on the cheap I figured I'd just get a new upgraded laptop last week  and sell the old one after I fixed it since I would be starting from scratch on the old one anyway, BAD IDEA.1. WINDOWS 8 BLOWS CHUNKS. I even went to classicshell.net for a change to a similar interface but it's still pretty bad.2.This thing is FULL OF ADWARE and other POPUPS which cant' be removed w/out reinstalling windows. I'm running the same adblockers and as my old unit on Firefox and they hardly make a dent.3. It's SLOW??!! I'm only running Skype and Firefox w/a few tabs and it getting really hot and slowing down, That's \"B A N A N A S\" to quote a favorite song...C'mon Really?4. The quality of this unit is really cheap, flimsy and plasticity compared to my last satellite.  The old one was like a Plymouth Satellite which is to say very practical and built like a tank.( I've owned a few and own a 68 wagon at present btw...SWEET)5. Last but not least THE SOUND QUALITY IS HORRIBLE even with headphones or external speakers. Skype is almost unusable and I have used it on various PCs and it always sounds the same, not so on this lemon. I tried everything I could think of or find in reviews and forums and nothing helped, Toshiba's own forum is full of complaints too about the sound.I just got off the phone with Toshiba tech support and they offered no fixes and just told me to return it to the store. WTF kind of tech support is that? They must know there is a problem and seem to have just given up I guess, that's pretty weak if you ask me. I mean even HP offered me a different model back in the day but that's a whole other can of worms...no HPs for me ever.Well I guess I will fix my old 755 w/a solid state drive to speed it up a bit and just look at other brands. I MIGHT look at Toshibas in the future but I will damn well take a close look especially the sound.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "yucky sound", "Author": "Kay Rodrigues", "ReviewID": "R1K5YLHK09U0ES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This seems like a pretty good laptop, but it has the tinniest sound system I've ever dealt with on a computere.
