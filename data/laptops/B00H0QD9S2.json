Touch pad is also slow and occasionally doesn't respond at all.  The right and left click pads on touch pad make a loud clicking noise.  So loud that this computer could not be used in a room where another person is sleeping.Had this for 1 week and decided that it needs to go back to Amazon.Their reply...they will give a credit of only $270!  \"Because you have taken it out of the box\".  Wow Amazon!  Shame on you.We'll go back to Costco for our electronic purchases.  They stand behind their products.Save your money and look for another make/model for your laptop", "Date": "February 11, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00H0QD9S2"}}
