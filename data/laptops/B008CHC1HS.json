Hiller", "ReviewID": "R3MVI7LH7K9YSV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased a very nice used laptop on the Amazon Marketplace from Dutchmonkey10.  I did require anything that we as state of the art or super powerful.  I have heard  some negative comments about Windows 8 as well, so this prompted me to explore the used market.  So I purchased an Acer laptop from Dutchmonkey10.  I came with a Pentium 6200 dual core processor, 4 gigabytes, ram 500 gigabytes hard disk and Windows 7.  Just what I was looking for.The only negatives that I notice after having it 2 days is the right click button sticks a little bit and the laptop is a little on the heavy side.  Neither is a problem as I prefer a wireless mouse and I will not need to move it very frequently.I can highly recommend Dutchmonkey10.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "2.5 stars.  Lost Hard Drive ... Luckly I just backed up.", "Author": "fdoamerica \"fdoamerica\"", "ReviewID": "R15YYPZJWY6DP7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had two other ACERS and they were very good laptops.  Initially, I liked this computer, especially factoring in the price.  I like the display, the keyboard and the processor (for daily use) - but most I liked the price $299 on sale.  Then, recently I was told by a salesman at 'Best Buy' that ACER's quality has gone down and they were getting returns because ACER has been having problems with laptop hard drives.  Two weeks after he told me that - wham - the hard drive when out.  Thankfully, I had 1 week remaining on the 1yr warranty (1 week - what a squeaker) .  They replaced it (took over 20 days total turnaround time) and now it is back up and running.  Since I grew up with failing hard drives I am a zealot for backing up - almost daily.  So the hard drive failure was not a data disaster.  That said I can only give this computer 2.5 stars because of reliability. I doubt I will buy another ACER.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Acer for the win!", "Author": "Brittney Hibdon", "ReviewID": "RTISWOVXSZCGV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned a lot of computers for a few hundred dollars to Alienwares \"laptop\" that was a whopping 4 grand. (a ridiculous amount of money to pay for a computer that was the worst thing I had ever owned) This Acer has been incredible, usually i go for the heavy name brand computers, my HP's were great, but dealing with my roommates Acer to do homework on and finding that it was the only reliable computer, I sought out this little guy that was the best bang for the buck. it is powerful, has no trouble supporting multiple apps flawlessly and remains relatively cool (my Alienware would burn the crap out of my leg). It is a great computer that will get you through everything without making you want to chuck it under the tires of your car. It is lightweight, the palm rest and track pad are in comfortable locations, just overall very happy with it and I have had it about 6 months I daresay.\u200b", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Review of my laptop", "Author": "Marge Roberts", "ReviewID": "RE3YJ2GLIPDJN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "the only problem for me is the touch pad is off to the left and not centered like all the other laptops.
