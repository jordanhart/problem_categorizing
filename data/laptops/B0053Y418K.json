I switched from an 08 macbook pro to this laptop so I was initially planning on being underwhelmed.  The only reason I decided to switch to a PC was my macbook was running out of warranty (which I used heavily). I was able to sell it for the price of this PC with a 3 year warranty. Obviously the construction of this laptop isn't as impressive as the macbook (plastic versus aluminum).  However the function and responsiveness of the operating system is similar and impressive.  This is my first windows 7 experience, and I have been impressed so far. For the price of this laptop I don't think you can go wrong.My favorite things about this toshiba besides the improved ram and storage over my macbook are:1. Track pad lock feature, this is really handy if you use your word processor a lot.2. 10 key keypad on this laptop is a nice feature that I didn't have on my macbook3. The side vent cooling feature is really nice, this laptop stays cool all the time.4. Battery seems to be pretty good(although my macbook's battery was also really impressive and could run for hours unplugged even after years of use).The only con is the amount of crap that comes preloaded on these PC's, but I am sure that is not unique to this laptop.  That is something apple figured out a long time ago.  It is really overwhelming trying to figure out which programs are important and which are not.  Especially when you haven't used a PC in years.", "Date": "September 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "You can do better...and worse.", "Author": "O. Reyes", "ReviewID": "R1GFMTS4C401N7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My 4 year old Toshiba laptop was getting a bit long in the tooth so I decided to get an updated one. Due to budget restraints, I couldn't get the P-series Toshiba with the upgraded graphics, so I settled on the L-series. I've had this laptop for a month and found a few interesting points that might help some of you out there.1. This laptop is not heavy at all. The weight is really well proportioned.2. Intel integrated HD graphics are a joke. Don't expect to play any games at any decent quality resolutions or settings.3. The Realtek wifi adapter is about the lowest quality you can find. It would disconnect all the time, never connect at anywhere above 72mbps. If you get this laptop, spend the extra $25 on an Intel Centrino 6200 mini pci card.4. Ram is cheap. Immediately upgrade this to 8gb of ram. As of this writing, you can pick up 8Gb for $35.5. The touchpad multi-touch is really annoying. How annoying? I've magnified/de-magnified my screen at least 4 times while writing this.6. The numberpad throws me off. I'm not used to it on a laptop.7. The 500gb hard drive is OK. I'd prefer a 7200rpm model, but I can deal.8. No bluetooth. It's a <$2 part. It really should be standard on everything by now.9. 10/100. Again, Gigabit Ethernet should be standard on everything by now.10. The keyboard is glossy, therefore it is slippery and prone to smudging.", "Date": "September 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great!!!", "Author": "Hay Bay Bay", "ReviewID": "RNQP1VB0VKYJ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had plenty of computer brands to know what I was looking for this time. I have had Dell, HP, Gateway, Acer, and Mac. I knew i did not want a Dell, HP, or Acer. When getting my husbands computer fixed I asked the repair guy what brand should i look into to get the most bang for my buck. He told me Toshiba. I had bused my moms Toshiba and I loved it so I looked around for the right Toshiba for me. This computer is exactly what I was looking for. I am so glad I got this one too! It is fast and easy to navigate around.The look of the computer is great as well! I love that the number pad is separate, most laptops do not have that. The screen is a perfect size and the outside is very sleek. I havent had to take it anywhere yet, but I can imagine that it wont be too much of a hassel because it is not heavy at all.

This laptop is actually a replacement of my brother's older Toshiba laptop. The previous laptop that he owned didn't actually have any software problems. The laptop accidentally fell from a chair and the motherboard and screen were broken. He had it for 3 years and never had problems with it. As much as he wanted to save the laptop, it would cost him $150 for replacing the broken parts. Considering that a lot of newer laptops with better specs came out within the three years, I told him it would be best to just buy a new one. We bought this laptop @ $449.99, which an additional $300 with a much better specs. When he was looking for a new laptop, he explicitly told me that he wanted another Toshiba. This laptop has a very nice color. We also liked that it as an HDMI outlet since we want to see some clips on a bigger screen. The only thing I hated about this is there were a lot of programs pre-installed but it's just a minor problem since you could just uninstall them. Overall, I would recommend this for people looking for cheaper but quality laptop.", "Date": "August 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Laptop for Granddaughter", "Author": "Gordon Gonzalez", "ReviewID": "R1H848JTRU2QF9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the laptop for my 12 year old granddaughter mainly for schoolwork.  She uses the Internet to research topics and the prepare homework and presentations.  It's a great value given the speed of the processor and the other specs: 500 GB hard Drive, 4 GB of RAM, battery life of over 5 hours, a bright screen and the attractive grey diamond case.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Be Aware.", "Author": "Pete E", "ReviewID": "R1A1N3TUBT7D60", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased my L755 in December of 2011. It is a nice product for the price, and at first I was thrilled with it. The only deficiency coming out of the box was the battery life. It is advertised as 4-5 hours, when in reality it only lasts that long while resting. If you actually use the computer, the battery lasts about 2-2.5 hours. If you run media like video and movies, that life goes down to 1.5-2 hours. Frustrating if you want to watch a movie on your computer without plugging it in, which I do! So this computer fails from the battery life standpoint IMO.Second, and the bigger of the two reasons I give this laptop a 2. About three months into its use I start getting a pop-up notify from Toshiba themselves, claiming that my unit needs a BIOS update. Being the skeptical person that I am, I call Toshiba to check its validity, and they tell me that it is indeed a Toshiba based alert that should be installed to help with my units functionality. As I proceed to download the BIOS update, the computer goes black! It is basically dead, and it won't come back. The BIOS update specifically says to NOT shut the computer down during the update, so I let the computer sit black for 24 hours. Finally, I realize that it's not coming back, and I shut it down. (Power it off) When I power it back on, it stays powered on with a black screen for about 10 secs, and then shuts itself right back off.After searching the problem on line, I find that this problem is not unique, in fact I find dozens of people in forums talking about the same problem. So, it's time to send it in for repair. I could write a few paragraphs about that experience alone. Dealing with customer service reps from foreign countries is not the end of the world if they can actually understand and help with your problem, but most cannot. Toshiba is no exception. Outsourcing customer service is a short term money saver for the tech industry, but the long term effect will do more damage than good IMO. Highlights of my experience:1)Toshiba makes YOU pay $25 to send the computer back to them. REALLY?! After your BIOS update is the reason for the problem? (Insert favorite cuss word here)2) I am forced to spend $125 on an external hard drive, and have the thing backed up by micro center3) The computer is returned in a reasonable amount of time. (About 10 days)4) When I open the box, there is crack in the plastic top right next to the Toshiba logo (definitely was not there when I sent it in)5) The computer now takes about 5 minutes to load windows, when before it took about 30 seconds. Imagine sitting in front of your laptop for 5 minutes doing nothing...it's seems like a lifetime!6) I continue to get notifications from Toshiba for updates, but I don't trust them enough to actually install them.Now I am stuck with a computer that takes forever to load windows, has practically NO battery after less than one year of use, and cannot be updated without fear of crashing...and I have already invested an addition $150, on top of the almost $500 I paid for the computer.Thanks a lot Toshiba, you have created another Apple user.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "A fantastic laptop overall", "Author": "Emily", "ReviewID": "R3LRVZV2ADQBB8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for a little over a month now, and I absolutely love it (thus the 5 stars).  Granted, I'm also coming from a laptop that was nearly 8 years old, so keep that in perspective.Pros:-As a student and writer, I desperately rely on a good keyboard for day-to-day use.  I've been pretty satisfied with this one so far.  As with any new keyboard, it took a little getting used to, but the keys are pretty easy to use and overall I have no complaints.-The hard-drive space.  I don't know what I'm going to ever do with all these gigabytes, but I'm happy I have them.-Low heat/Quiet.  This laptop is very quiet, and so far has never gotten hot.  It will get a little warm, but nothing compared to my old laptop.  I actually realized I had set it running on a chair for a couple of hours, and when I returned I expected it to be threatening to overheat--instead it was barely warm. The LEDs really do make a difference.-Screen size is great, and the laptop itself is still lightweight.-Overall performance is great.  RAM and processor seem pretty good.  I'm able to do basic day-to-day stuff (email, document writing, etc.) with complete ease.  I can also run games on it pretty well, but sometimes it lags with bigger online games (MMORPGs and such) depending on the size/complexity of the game.Cons:-The lagging issue with some bigger online games, but that may be more internet related than performance related.-Every few weeks, the speakers will start making this clicking noise only while producing other sound (music, video, etc.).  I downloaded an audio update from the Toshiba website, and that seems to have solved the problem.  However, another week later, it was doing it again.  I assume this is a weird updating issue (as the problem started after I had already used the computer for a few weeks and did get fixed after an update) and not a hardware issue.  However, if it persists, I might look into my lovely 1-year warranty.  But generally the speaker volume, as usual with laptops, leaves something to be desired.-The touch-pad is a little sticky, and can be difficult to use (sometimes it will scroll up and down when I don't want it to because I would have accidentally touched it too far on its edges), but it has enough USB ports so you can just plug in a mouse.-Usually the CD/DVD-ROM drive functions fine, but there was one program I was trying to install and it sounded like my laptop was preparing to take off down a runway. It was disturbingly loud, to the point where I thought it would have a meltdown.  But in the end the program installed fine and my laptop is still alive and well.-Of course it comes with the usual program start-up junk.  But it includes a free month of Norton protection, some great games, a book app, and more.  I didn't even delete any of it.  So including the operating system and all that, you (obviously) start out with significantly less gigs than the full 500.  But after migrating some documents, games, and some music, I still have 357 gigs free. And for me, that's a ton of space.-The screen itself is glossy so it can pick up glare (my old laptop had a different screen material) but I think this is pretty commonplace nowadays.-Most of my complaints have nothing to do with the computer itself and have more to do with Windows 7 (which I'm finally starting to get used to, and I do love the safety features--always verifying if you want to run a program before it runs) and internet browser issues (it comes with Google Chrome, which I expected to love, but I found myself downloading Firefox instead.)The cons are pretty minor--not enough to counter the pros in my opinion.  Overall I'm very pleased with this laptop and would definitely recommend it.", "Date": "January 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Laptop, Incredible Value", "Author": "Jerry P. Danzig", "ReviewID": "R2E20EM2VNW24Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For anyone who wonders whether an under-$500 laptop can be any good, the answer is: you'd better believe it!I've owned and used a number of PCs over the past twenty years, and this is the best so far.First, Windows 7 is a significant improvement over XP.  I say that based on the rapid startup and shutdown times alone -- XP would take five minutes to \"apply its makeup upon wakeup\".  W7 is up and running in about 30 seconds, and it shuts down just as fast.  It also seems to take care of most scheduled maintenance tasks on its own.Second, Toshiba specializes in laptops, and this one gleams with quality (I have the model in red, not gray).  Super bright LED HD screen -- check!  Sleep & charge USB port -- check!  Built-in webcam and mike -- check!  JVC DVD/BR player and burner drive -- check!  Full-size keyboard with numeric keypad -- check!  Stereo speakers -- check!  4GB of system memory with a 500GB hard drive -- check!Now in truth I don't need a screaming, cutting-edge computer.  I have a Sony PS3 to play video games.  I use a computer for standard functions, including Internet, word processor, email and calendar, database, photo shop, and playing and burning CDs and DVDs.This Toshiba seems to handle all these tasks -- simultaneously -- without breaking a sweat.  The only improvements I have made are adding the tube-shaped Logitech sound bar that hangs behind the screen, keeping the computer cool on a Targus padded cooling stand, and buying a little USB keyboard light for use in dark places.Otherwise the laptop's battery seems to last several hours, depending on what you're doing, the keyboard and touch pad feel great, and -- well, the only negative I can think of is IMO Toshiba's Start-up and Users Guides could have been better written, but then I'm a writer.The long and short of it is, PCs have come a long way since Mac guy made fun of us, and now that you can get a beautiful laptop like this for a half to a third of the price of an equivalent Mac -- who's having the last laugh now?
