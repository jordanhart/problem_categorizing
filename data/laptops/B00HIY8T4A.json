{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "John S. Dean \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R1UR84463MSJ0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used to use Tablet PC's back from when they were first introduced in 2004 with XP Tablet PC Edition all the way through 2009 when I switched to a Mac.  After seeing some of the progress with Windows 8 and touch screens, I picked up a Surface Pro when they first came out to test the waters, and liked it.  I decided to switch back to Windows.I couldn't keep using the Surface Pro though as my main machine because of the keyboards.  I didn't mind the cramped keyboard, but the first gen had no backlight, and the trackpad on them was about the worst trackpad experience I ever had.  There was no way I could migrate to that as my daily use machine for home and work from the gorgeous trackpads on the MacBook Pro laptops I had been using.So I tried Lenovo's Yoga 2 Pro, which I loved, but the QHD screen made it nearly impossible for me to do any work on, since I'm usually remotely working on servers, and the RDP sessions don't scale well.  Since I ran it at 1920x1080 all the time anyway because of that, it seemed I should just get a laptop with that as the native resolution.  So I got the Thinkpad Helix, figuring it was the best of both worlds - great keyboard, full tablet when I wanted, but still a \"notebook\" which I use at least 80% of the time.  That was a great machine, and I still have it, just don't use it much because as a tablet, it ran too hot and was uncomfortable to hold.  So since I spent all the \"tablet\" time on it with it just reversed in the dock so they keyboard was still underneath it, I figured what is the point, that's no different than the Yoga line since I couldn't just use it in a pure tablet mode due to that heat problem.So I figured I'd get the Thinkpad Yoga.  I get things through a Lenovo Rep and a special program with a huge discount, so my options were limited.  I was able to get about 38% off of this model though, but with the bigger 256GB SSD.  They had no i7 processor models with 8GB RAM, which was what both the Yoga 2 Pro were as well as the Helix, but since the most intense CPU work my systems do would be muxing HD video, I thought I'd give this a shot and see.And I was very happy to note that the things I do, worked just as fast as they did on the i7.  Even the muxing of HD content goes as quick.  My multitasking involves having a some Office programs open, maybe a web browser, and a bunch of RDP sessions, so it's nothing this i5 hasn't handled flawlessly with just 4GB RAM.It's quiet.  On the Helix, I had to use the TPFancontrol program to try to silence it some since even at low usage when it wasn't getting hot, it ran the fan fast and loud.  This one I usually don't hear at all.  Yesterday I was at a Microsoft event and a person next to me had an older model MacBook Pro, and I forgot how much fan noise they could generate when flash was playing.  This one is the most silent laptop I've had for a LONG time.The keyboard feels great.  The trackpoint was a bit of a letdown though, since it is actually SMALLER than the Helix trackpad was.  And for some unknown reason Synaptics has to force us all to never be able to click on the bottom right of the trackpad without it being a right click.  The way I position my hands, the bottom right corner is where my thumb lay, and that's where I clicked on the Mac, using the rest of it for my index finger to drag things wherever.  Can't do that on this one.  I've played for weeks in the registry trying to turn that OFF, and there is no way.  It's hard coded apparently.  All you can do is make the zone smaller, which is no help whatsoever.  It's the Synaptics trackpad that is the ONLY reason I took a star off of this.  Lenovo has to come up with a better answer since it was the same junk on all three Lenovo laptops I've owned in the last three months, the Yoga 2 Pro, the Helix, and this Thinkpad Yoga.  NO reason that can't be a user enabled option.It boots as fast as any other SSD system I've been using (exclusively been on them for about 2.5 years now so for me it's just \"normal\" boot speed now, until I get on an older or non SSD system and am shocked at how long it can take).Screen is crisp and bright, good contrast, good clarity.  My Helix had persistent images (ghosting) within a day or two.  Even my Retina MacBook Pro had it (but not as bad as the Helix).  This one, so far in the month or so I've been using it, has not shown any sign.  It's on 24/7 since it processes things while I'm sleeping, so it's only ever turned off when I go to work, or when I come home, while being transported in my bag.Keyboard is nice and quiet as well, another thing that is better than the Helix.  The backlight though is annoying.  You can turn it on easily enough with Function + Space Bar, but if your screen goes to sleep, the backlight turns off.  It *ALWAYS* defaults to Off, there's no way to just have it on, or even to remember the last state.  Since I do a lot of work at home at night, and have this on a stand next to my couch where I can reach over to keep some processes going without putting it on my lap, this is annoying since I would rely on the backlight to show me where the keys are - can't touch type on a machine that's 90 degrees rotated from \"normal\" and two feet off to my side with one hand.  This is another poor decision by Lenovo.USB 3 works great.  The 802.11AC wireless is FAST.  My Thinkpad Retina i7's 802.11n would move large files to my server around 15Mb/s.  This, with my new 802.11AC wireless, copies between 35 and 40 Mb/s.  So nearly three times faster, which I'm pleased with.What I was *NOT* pleased with from Lenovo was the wireless overall.  I used to have an Airport Extreme wireless unit, since I had my Macbooks and iPhones and iPads.  It was the most rock solid wireless ever, and worked great, better than anything else I tested while I was converting to Mac back in 2009.  But every Lenovo system I had, the Yoga 2 Pro, the Helix, and this Thinkpad Yoga, all failed with that.  I would connect, then randomly would lose connectivity to the internet.  I was still connected to the WIRELESS, just said \"limited connectivity\" and the only way around it was to turn my wireless off / on again. Then it would connect fine, but it was a non stop process.  And it wasn't just MY airport at home, I had the same issues at clients who used airports.  But it never happened anywhere else, which was when I swapped my Airport for the 802.11ac wireless and I've been solid ever since.  I'm not sure which side of things the fault lies, the intel chips used for the wireless in these three Lenovo systems, or the Airport itself.  So I can't really fault Lenovo, as it may be an Intel failing.The weight is great, and it's not difficult to hold even in tablet mode.  Not as light as the Surface, or the Helix when it was in tablet only mode, but it's a full pound lighter than my 15\" Retina MacBook Pro was, and it's noticeable in the bag that I'm not carrying as much.It does a good job of sensing the pen, and disabling the capacitive input so your hand doesn't register while you're using the pen.  The digitizer works well, much better than the systems I was using from 2004 through 2009.  It's a small pen though, so for serious use, you'll want to get a third party pen that's larger and more \"natural\" and preferably with the \"eraser\" on the top.Power brick is small so it's not too bad, but I wish more places would start doing like Apple, and even the Microsoft Surface, and do magnetic plugs so there's no chance of something breaking, and smaller power bricks that can plug straight into the wall, rather than having to have a second power cord plugging into the other end of the brick.  Seems such a poor design choice.The Windows button under the screen was odd at first, since it's contoured to fit the bottom beveled edge, and I thought it was odd, but it doesn't impair use.  And the button itself feels much more solid than the Yoga 2 Pro or the Helix buttons.  I wish they just did a haptic button like the Surface though.Flipping it back is a piece of cake, it's not tough to do, yet the hinges are solid enough to keep the screen steady wherever you position it.  The keyboard bezel raising up to flatten the bottom when in tablet mode is a neat feature, but for me not something that drove me to this.  I never minded keys under my hand, was used to that with the Surface Pro and the Yoga 2 Pro, but apparently people didn't like the feel of the keys moving under their hands.  If that describes you, this solution solves the issue.Power button is a bit recessed, which some people have complained about, but I don't mind it, it's better than the Helix's was.  I wish they had a little more space between power and volume though, I have unintentionally hit power when trying to adjust the volume when I'm doing it by touch rather than eyeballing it.SD card works well, and let me free up about 60GB on the hard drive since I now have my music on an SD card.  It does extend a MM or two from the edge though, I wish they could have made it a bit more recessed so it sat flush.  It doesn't impair my use at all though, and hasn't been a problem for my laptop carrying bag.Sound is about what you'd expect from basically an ultrabook.  Tinny, not much volume.  Yoga 2 Pro sounded better.My use usually is just normal apps and about 70% brightness and running it in power mode I hit 5 to 6 hours of use that way.  I've extended myself to about 7 to 7.5 hours on a single charge by doing power saving mode and having screen brightness about half way, but I'm usually not that far from an outlet so it's not a big issue for me.  It's on par with what I got from the 15\" Retina MB Pro, so I'm satisfied.Bluetooth hasn't been an issue at all, works with any of my sound docks.  And iTunes on here has no issues with airplay on my receiver in my AV system.It's nice and thin, it's light, it's strong, very little flex in the body.All told, it's really a great system, best tablet I've ever owned, and I've owned a LOT since I was a Microsoft MVP for tablet PC's for a few years.  If they'd fix the trackpad, I would give this 5 stars.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Some good some bad", "Author": "J. Rowe", "ReviewID": "R3BVUYUSQ9CP4C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this directly from a Microsoft store because they advertised $100 off if you trade in a XP laptop. In the store I noticed the built in mouse is a little hard to use to right click and scroll. Not a huge deal but that was my first impression. Next I tried out the touch screen and pen and both were better than I expected. Right away I noticed how responsive the screen was to touch and drawing in the OneNote app. My son really loved painting with the pen and his fingers.The good:The Lenovo pen and screen work well for the paint and and OneNote. The build quality feels good and solid. It has a nice keyboard and optional lighting for the keys which can be configured. The screen is very nice. Seems bright, good resolution, and HD picture quality. When using it as a tablet I found it very easy to type on the screen. No heat or noise during use. So far it is quick and responsive without issues. I'm impressed with the screen and the multiple form factors you get by being able to fully rotate the screen backwards.Some of the bad.The camera quality is bad, not sure how they claim 720p. I would hate to use this for Skype and pictures would be terrible. The built in mouse is just hard to use still even after giving it some more of a try. I did adjust the right click area in the Lenovo settings and that seemed to help a little. Another trick is to just use gestures on the mouse pad instead of trying to click and scroll on webpages.So my initial reaction is it's a good laptop but corners were cut probably due to the expense of the screen and unique design. The poor quality of the camera is probably the biggest issue found so far. This seems like a nice device for basic office, family activities, entertainment, and light gaming.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "ColoradoGuy", "ReviewID": "RACHWS52295X9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've just received this laptop so I'll just be giving you my first impressions and I'll update later.Trackpad - this track pad is much closer to that of a MacBook Pro's than of the older generation of Lenovos. However, I have enjoyed using it and did not have the problem that the earlier review mentioned. When I click the mouse does not move at all and it has been accurate so far.Digitizer - I haven't used it a lot but it definitely works and is pressure sensitive, as advertised. The screen also, for everything I've used so far, will not accept input from your hands if the pen is close to the screen. Which is AWESOME for people that will be taking a lot of notes with it, such as myself.Build Quality - So far it feels very sturdy. Even flipping the screen back and forth does not feel flimsy at all. True to Thinkpad form.As for the screen ghosting I haven't noticed anything but at the same time I haven't used it extensively yet. However, I do know that the reason for this is the Phillips panel used for this screen. And after looking around a lot it seems that they have started to manufacture a screen that does not have this problem and that even in the earlier models the problem was not present in 100% of the laptops.I'm not a huge fan of Windows 8 but with Windows 8.1 they've added the ability to pretty much bypass the Metro UI and just stick with the desktop - so don't steer clear of this laptop just because you don't want the added hassle of installing Windows 7.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Shamim", "ReviewID": "R3CDEFVMQYKFK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using it for 2 months.

I had paid for the upgraded warranty, and they overnighted me a box to return it to their repair center.  I had asked for a local place in Houston to take it to and they directed me to a partner finding page on their website.  The customer care rep had no idea who to call.  After calling 3 different venders from the list and finding them all out of service, went with the overnight shipping back to the repair center.Received it back the following Friday with a note saying they replaced the motherboard and everything was tested and working correctly.  But, still did not work!  Called customer support; was advised they could ship me another box to have returned back to the repair center.  Asked to either have someone sent to the house to repair it, ship me a new computer, or refund my money.  Was put on hold so the guy could talk to his team leader.  After 15 min was sent back to the switchboard, transferred back and disconnected.  Called again, new rep was rude, could not find original info, and when asked for his name, hung up on me.  Called again, and finally got a team leader to call me back.  Said he could ask for  a one time exception to have someone come to the house, but it would have to be approved, and probably wouldn\u2019t be.  Same response for immediately shipping out a new computer, or refunding my money so I could purchase a better brand.  We need this computer for our business and this long delay is unacceptable.  So I told him to email me a shipping lable and I would immediately put it in the mail back to them, his response, we have to ship you a whole new box and label?????  I have the box I just received 2 hours ealier, just send me the label!The worst customer support I have ever received.  They should buy and apple product and call their support to learn how to operate.  I will be trying to get my money back to do just that!", "Date": "May 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great stylus, but Windows 8 apps need some work", "Author": "Avid Reader \"AR\"", "ReviewID": "R13A7YJVY4RUB3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this computer a week and a half ago and like it a lot, but also note some issues that need upgrading.I have never owned a tablet; just laptops. Dell at home, and used Thinkpad at work. I've liked the Thinkpads better so was leaning towards a Thinkpad. I really wanted something I could take notes on, especially PDF files, for when I review documents and when I get presentation slide decks. I bought it from the Microsoft store at my local mall because the price was less expensive than the Amazon price and they did all the setup for me there. I also bought the 2 year warranty since it had good reviews, and since I used my Discover card, it added another year to it.The stylus pen with this computer was amazing. It has an icon at the bottom that allows you to handwrite in anywhere that text is accepted, and then it detects your handwriting. It does a good job. I also installed Office 2013; One Note's handwriting recognition is not quite as good as the Windows 8 icon.I also like that it has the Windows 8 touch apps, and then you can switch to Windows mode like you are use to seeing that required double clicking. This is especially helpful because many of the Windows 8 apps don't function great just yet, and so I can then switch to Windows mode, go to Internet Explorer, and find the corresponding website.I don't notice any problems with screen glare. I do find the text a bit small but I'm sure I can fix that by changing the resolution. The keyboard is OK, but doesn't seem as easy to type as my Thinkpad T430 that I use for work. The startup is so quick vs Windows XP that takes forever. The mouse red thing isn't quite as good as my T430, but reasonable good. I use my pen or a hooked up mouse most of the time.The main deficiency are the Windows 8 applications. For example, Chrome doesn't always load pictures, and it's \"metro\" (Windows 8) mode has a launch screen that is annoying. Chrome also freezes. Zillow's Windows 8 app pulls up my saved searches but includes houses not on that search. PDF reading is the most difficult. It comes with a Windows PDF reader that allows you to mark them up, in one color, but not highlight. Adobe has a Touch Reader that allows one to highlight, but not markup. Both allow good scrolling through the documents with your finger, and markup with the pen. Foxit PDF reader allows both markup and highlighting. However, you have to use your fingers, and doesn't recognize the stylus that well. Furthermore, when I highlight, it highlights a lot of extra material that I didn't want highlighted. Also, Foxit makes you switch back and forth between highlight and scroll, and it gets mixed up. None of them allow copying of a highlighted text to a note, the way the way Acrobat does. The Mail app is lacking a lot and with gmail, isn't converting text to links as it is supposed to, and showed a blank screen with my receipt for the product because it couldn't handle the pictures. Outlook 2013 handles it all well. As I said, I make up for the deficiencies in the Windows 8 app by switching from Touch mode to Windows mode.I do like the 7 MB of Onedrive space since I was used to Dropbox. I added my phone so now I think I have 10 MB. I am still a bit concerned that the hard disk is so small on this computers.I think the weight is fine and the size is fine. Nice and thin. Overall, like it a lot, especially the pen, and hope the app developers see my comments and fix them up.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lenovo Thinkpad 'money grab' Yoga", "Author": "Injuh", "ReviewID": "R1HVRJTDYGPKNI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The Thinkpad line is geared towards business users.
