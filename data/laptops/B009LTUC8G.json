Since I was used with XP, the change to windows 8 was time consuming. But later ( after 6 months) I like it. It is fast. Sometimes getting re-connected to the wireless router is not easy !! eventhough there was no change other than closing and opening again the laptop ( not even switching off). If it happened, then need to reboot the system. But I have another laptop which is almost 5y old doesn't have this issue. Interestingly the wireless router is also brand new. Besides this glitch, everything else is fine with the system.", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "The motherboard was defective, had to return it", "Author": "Boris S.

CARROLL", "ReviewID": "R3755BG7CE1Z99", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was worried about getting the new Windows 8, but now I am glad I did get it.  Microsoft really has changed the Windows as we have known them.  It is NOTHING like the previous ones we have had before. It is so amazing with what they came up with.  I am still learning all the new changes.  Now for the Dell product? It is a very nice laptop. The problem that I had was the end of the DVD door kept falling off. I went ahead and returned it. Amazon couldn't replace it. It was out of stock. I went ahead and ordered another Dell but it is 17\", and has more specs that are greater. I first started with the Dell Desktop and later the Dell Laptop. After that stage, I got the Toshiba Laptops.  Now I am back with Dell and am staying there.  It shows so much quality and this Silver color is beautiful. The outer edge is a light silver and the rest looks like medium brush aluminum color.  It is heavier than the others I had. I wouldn't want to carry it all over the place. I just use mine in my home. It runs really cooler than the older ones did.  It turns on really fast and the whole system runs fast. There is no cons here. The problem I did have was really odd, but I still want the same type of laptop. I am sure if you did order this, after it is restocked, you won't have any problems and I know that you will love it, too. I hate the idea when I do get the new one, I will have to put my settings and programs all back in, again. That does take a lot of time. I definitely would recommend that you buy a Dell laptop. It is the way to go.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009LTUC8G"}}
