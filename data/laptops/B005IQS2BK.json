{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not bad at all", "Author": "Benny", "ReviewID": "R1BQDLV2V7LZIN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this computer about a year and a half, and I think it's pretty spiffy. I bought it at Walmart for $330-ish, I think. After about a year of using it with no problems, the hard drive crashed, and it needed replacing (about $200).What compelled me to write a review was the comments that the laptop hinges broke. I had the same problem with mine. The plastic at the hinges on the laptop base separated and the screen became loose. I couldn't close it without the computer making breaking noises. After a little examining, I realized that the one of the screws on the bottom of the laptop that hold the hinges to the plastic had came out. I \"borrowed\" a screw from a different part of the laptop (oops) and it's been fine since. If you have this laptop, I strongly suggest tightening the display hinge screws, which are located right underneath the hinges on the underside of the laptop, with a jeweler's screwdriver to make sure your screen doesn't get floppy, or so that you don't lose a screw entirely.", "Date": "December 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "don't buy it", "Author": "mynamesjon", "ReviewID": "ROW8KNVOI6H40", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Terrible. So slow, crashes constantly. Video is grainy. sound tinny. I haven't downloaded any viruses, looked at a single page of porn. Yet still it acts like it's been through the wars and i've only had it for 1 week. Don't buy it. With age I am really learning that you should'nt skimp on things. Most things that are cheap, are cheap for a good reason. Because they are terrible. DON'T buy it.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Near Complete Piece of Garbage", "Author": "L. Padron \"lpadron\"", "ReviewID": "R3B0COKMN2OSEN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this Toshiba laptop brand new from a local big box vendor. Avoid buying the laptop if at all possible. If I could rate it at less than 1 star I would.Cons:1. Battery stopped charging less than 6 months after purchase. A replacement battery  from Toshiba requires a $176 holding charge on a credit card even though Toshiba customer  support never bothered to determine whether the problem was the battery or the latop itself.2. LCD screen broke after a tap to the *back* of the laptop. Toshiba's repair depot charged $325, nearly the cost of the laptop itself, to repair. I bought a screen here on Amazon for $72 and fixed it myself in 40 minutes.3. The absolute worst customer support I've ever come across.Pros:1. cheap and efficient if used for basics (web browsing, document handling).This is the last Toshiba item I'll ever purchase. Toshiba customer support and the product and customer support have been nothing short of infuriating.", "Date": "March 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible Service and Broken Product from Secondipity at Amazon", "Author": "AmazonShopper1326", "ReviewID": "R39K06IAOHXUDV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This item was delivered broken with the screen cracked.  It was dead on arrival.  We were NOT ALLOWED TO RETURN THE ITEM as we have attempted several times to contact the seller and have been IGNORED!!  The laptop is unusable and we already paid for it!!  We are extremely distraught and feel cheated by the seller, Secondipity, which will not only give a broken item to a customer, but ignore their request to return or exchange the computer. One star is far too much to give to the lack of service and quality of product.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "HORRIBLE!! USELESS!

It quit working all together in March this year.First the hinges broke on both sides of the lid.

I was online one day shopping for baby shower things for my sister and the piece of junk crashed. It hasn't booted up since. I press the power button and NOTHING HAPPENS! AT ALL!

You pay a few hundreds of dollars for a computer, you expect it to last at least a year. This last about 3 months before it started crashing, failing, stalling, etc.  Toshiba does not include a recovery disk with the pc, in case it crashes. It's poorly made, inside and out.  Inside, it easily crashes, there's not enough space, the software stalling drove me insane, etc. Outside, I don't know what happened but I literally closed it one night after writing, went to open it the next day and it popped, the part where the power button is snapped lo0se from the base. It's just a cheap piece of crap and while I never expected miracles, I did expect it to last until the semester ended.  My first Toshiba was given to me, I bought this one on my own accord.

A total piece of garbage. Screen broke after 3 months of regular use.
