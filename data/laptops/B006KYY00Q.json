I could have spent more, but I don't feel it was necessary. The fastest graphics card in a laptop will cost you thousands of dollars, while a basic desktop card, like the one i got in my desktop, will out perform any laptop. So i saved my money and upgraded my desktop and got this affordable guy!This little guy has a better multi-touch pad than the silver apple computers, and i am not lying. I can't emphasize on how much the feel of the mouse and the keyboard are when it comes to choosing this laptop. It makes the actual use of this laptop much more worth it! The only mouse that has as good as feel is the $1200 MBP.This AMD Model is the way to go. From everything i know, the graphics will out perform the stock Intel graphics that are in the more expensive laptops. The quad core AMD is very powerful cpu. The i3 line are just dual core's that are slightly faster, but have way less graphic power! Not to mention that Intel charges more. So you get a great price/performance when you stick to AMD!Description of Laptop:It doesn't have any place where your finger prints smudge. The lid is solid and not all shaky. The screen is actually really crisp. Surprisingly there was very minimum bloatware, like a bunch of games, samsung software that is useful and a pack of cyber link software.The GPU isn't the best you can get, but for under $600 you can't get anything this strong especially on the Intel's. All the other brands at this range all lack in 2 or more places and all the others lack when it comes to graphics.This one is seriously top notch compared to the others. They all have smudge city, cheap plastic, worth-less touch pad and flimsy keys. The chiclet keys on this make cleaning it much easier. and way easier to use.The weight on this is very light and I could barely feel it in my backpack. I started a timer from the second the computer booted and the battery said 100%. When the timer started I began playing Arkham City with 75% lighting. The laptop went \"4 HOURS\", with about 20% left. It probably would have gone another 30-40 minutes, but I don't like draining the battery.There was surprisingly no heat at all. The hottest spot is on the left side of the mouse, but the other side was just cold. The sound on this can get as loud as you need. The sound played beautifully and was real crisp. I mean it was really nice quality!Unless you want to spend an extra $250-$500, then this is your best bet for a good gaming/college laptop. Actually this is a laptop that everyone should get! Think of the graphics as the best you can get for under $800-$900!", "Date": "January 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "$399.99 Powerhouse? Yes.

They even give you partition software that makes it simple and easy to customize your PC.Bluetooth works amazingly well. Grabs a hold of all the signals I've sent it's way.Discrete class graphics processing unit with 512 MB RAM is more than enough power to run Source engine games such as Left 4 Dead at 1366x768 with everything maxed out in the graphics settings, along with 2-4x AA and 16 AF! Even Sega's Sonic Generations and Activision's War For Cybertron can be run at 1024x768 to 1366x768 with medium graphics quality and look gorgeous, with no drops in frame rates.Lightweight. Not a back breaker if carried in backpack, or shoulder bag. Weighs 5 pounds, even!Easy access hardware upgrades with ONE panel and screw to remove. So easy. HDD, RAM and optical drive access in one spot!Real, fully functional restore disc set...with a catch. The Windows disc is factory made and comes in the box. The drivers/software disc must be made by the user, through an easy to use wizard interface.Battery configuration is slightly annoying because of the 80/100 setting. When charged all the way to 100%, the overall life span will diminish like all batteries of this type. You have to go into the BIOS to fully unlock the battery, plus settings in Windows. A real hassle. If you leave it locked at 80% (factory, out of the box setting) it's supposed to ensure long life of the battery.Restore disc set is one part aggravation because the optical drive is picky about which brands it'll use. Philips will not work. Maxell and Verbatim will. Of those that won't, it won't even read them or detect their presence.Bloatware is partially necessary to get full functionality, such as enable/disable of: wifi, touchpad, backlight, print screen key, you get the idea. Without it, many important things will not work. At all.All in all, this is a very powerful system for under $400.00. As is, it's a fantastic multimedia machine. With the mods I made (maxed out RAM, overclocked CPU, Blu-Ray I added) this is a hearty HTPC, with medium to high gaming, that is easily a desktop replacement PC that's portable!I highly recommend it. Fantastic machine.", "Date": "February 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Fantastic Machine", "Author": "G", "ReviewID": "R1XY77X9U1IW46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a computer person. I do my research before I purchase anything and usually know exactly what I am getting for my money. I found this beautiful little machine and grabbed one for $399 while they were at Best Buy. I was completely surprised by the performance of this little beast. First of all, the laptop is beautiful, light, feels well built, and has a battery that lasts 4-5 hours even while streaming video over wifi. What really blew me away however was how strong the AMD processor and graphics capabilities are for a notebook at this price point. Since the video card shares system memory I bought another 4GB stick of DDR3 Ram for about $30 and installed it in the second slot (A nice feature) that starts empty on this laptop. I can run World of Warcraft on high with consistent 60fps everywhere, or even on ultra with up to 60fps in dungeons and 20-30fps everywhere else. I was also able to run The Old Republic for several hours at a time on medium settings with 30fps. This is a fantastic laptop for the price point, and for the mobile gamer or MMO person it gets the job done. The screen is very clear and resolution looks great, plus the HDMI port is a nice plus. Bluetooth built in is a feature usually found on more expensive laptops and makes uploading photos from your smartphone an absolute breeze.Aside from the RAM upgrade, I would also recommend a decent laptop cooler mat, as like every other laptop this thing can get a bit hot after several hours of gaming. One that props the laptop up a little allowing air to move beneath it is the best. I picked up this one at best buy for $20 and it does a great job:[...]All in all I paid less than $500 for the Laptop, Ram Upgrade, Cooling Pad, a nice case and a mouse for when I game.This is unbeatable and if you are considering doing any gaming at all, I would definitely recommend these AMD systems over the I3 and I5. Only when you get up to I7 do they start beating the A6 in graphics capability.", "Date": "February 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good laptop except for the bad quality plastic that is made of", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2UK27P7AE1QGA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I liked this laptop and still kinda like it, I got what it says on the box, fast, lightweight and cheap. The only reason what I am giving a 1 star is because of the material what is made of, pretty cheap plastic. I mean this is a portable device, the case material gotta be enough resistant for the daily handling: holding, lifting, open/close the lid, whatever. Well the story is after 2 months of having this computer, after a full day of working on it (was pretty hot btw) I grabbed from the left side of the case using one hand (lid open) and then I heard the crack and a big fissure appeared at the topcase, from the internal side of the lid support until reaching the keyboard (even through the keyboard by now), I gotta say this is not a heavy laptop, it weights the half of my former vaio computer and I am really not a strong person that crush stuff while holding it. I would feel better if I just dropped it or something, at least it would be my fault, but in this case I don't feel that was my fault, it wasn't a crack on the screen which the most common thing that might happen when you hold a laptop badly, it was a fracture on what's suppose to be the strongest part on a laptop. The temperature might also influence in this situation, but if you have bad quality plastic and heat then there is not surprise. Called Samsung and they consider this as an accident so it's not covered by the warranty. The crack is on the topcase, which is not a common replaceable part, after digging on the web for a replacement found a chinese site that sells the top cases for this brand, 50 bucks + shipping, received it today and during the replacement just found out that everything is cheap regarding this computer from screws to wires used on it. I almost broke the new topcase while replacing it. So beware about this product, use both hands while holding it, treat it extremely careful like you were holding a baby.", "Date": "June 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow!! a little hard to set up with Linux but awesome laptop!", "Author": "Michael Scarn", "ReviewID": "R1DXGYO1AMLIDU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before buying this I had my doubts if I'd ever get used to or get to like this weird keyboard. However, it did not take long. The keyboard is nice. The touchpad is the best I've had so far yet in a laptop.The screen resolution is amazing once you get the proprietary ATI driver installed.I had a little trouble with this system at the start. It would boot to blank black screen in Bodhi 1.3 and the current Linux Mint. However this seems to be an issue with \"new hardware\" and the lag time of linux support for the chipsets related to the amd a6 3400m family. luckily google pointed me to a message board thread relating to this; setting the linux kernel boot parameter with the option \"radeon.modeset=0\" made mint and bodhi installable from CD.My summary of pros and cons is listed below.Pro:--speed of quad cores and GPUs, as well as the internal drives and memory; amazing, especially considering the low wattage of the integrated CPU chip--a supercomputer that runs on batteries, something that could not be imagined a decade or two ago.--great value for a sub 500 usd laptop.--amazing crisp display; has hdmi output also.--great touchpad, good keyboard, and first impression makes me believe quality of components seems nice.--fits in a backpack; light and fairly compact.Con:--bluetooth (nor wifi) cannot be turned off from bios directly or from keyboard fn buttons--needs --software to do it. haven't figured out how to make linux do it yet.--no caps or num lock lights.--only 3 usb jacks (1 left, 2 right)--linux setup and support leaves a lot to be desired; thank goodness for message boards, google, and the kind geniuses posting on said boards.--I'm still very bothered and annoyed by not being able to shut off the RF of wifi and bluetooth with a single tap of two buttons like I was in my old laptop.", "Date": "January 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bang for your buck!", "Author": "Tlabrot", "ReviewID": "R3LNDZWKTFQKS9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've recently bought this laptop and have had it for a couple days now.

It delivered everything I needed then.  This weekend I was playing a DVD routed to the television via HDMI and about three quarters of the way through it made a popping sound and the picture went blank. All other components seem to be running fine. I called their customer service today and got a pleasant customer service person and a case number.  My low rating will go much higher if the repair is done quickly and to my satisfaction.  I have read some customer service reviews about Samsung and they don't sound good.Pros:  It does what I want it to.  Microsoft Office, Email, Youtube, minor gaming.  The instant on feature is quite nice, and the non-glare screen large enough and clear enough to read e-books in comfort.  It is not bad looking, open or closed, and the weight is low enough to sit in my lap.  It does not seem to get very warm.Cons:  Battery life for me has been about three hours on an 80 percent charge which is the default recommendation.  The touchpad is annoyingly  sensitive and, though I have a cordless mouse that works with it, I cannot figure out how to disable the touchpad when I need to.  Construction is suspect, as evidenced by the opening paragraph, but I am not sure if I got a lemon or just a crappy machine.I guess the jury is out on the final rating.After the 48 hours passed I called them again.  I gave the people the case number and they were mostly clueless about the problem.  I explained it to them once again and they emailed me a UPS label for return service and I sent it back to them using the UPS store.  I checked this evening and the barcode was registered as in transit.  The scheduled delivery is on 03/05 and I will monitor and report progress of fixing the problem as it develops.  I am a bit unsatisfied with the return process so far because:a}  They could not recognize the problem from the initial callb}  They issued me another case number after they failed to identify the problem that I fully explained the first time that I called themc}  I have been unable to register the product on the net and over the phone.  When I questioned that process I was told that there was probably some updating of the website and I should try later.  Subsequent attempts failed.d)  I am very suspicious of their warranty policy performance at this point.Update:The unit was received and repaired, but after two days it is still not being shipped back.  I had a lot of trouble registering it, but finally figured out that I could only complete the process in I.E.  Chrome would not do it.  Once registering, and additional three months of warranty was tacked on to the initial year and that is kind of nice.

Stay away!**A quad-core processor, 4 GB of RAM, a 500 GB hard drive, all for less than $500 - and it's a Samsung.What's the catch? None, apparently. I've had the computer for a week now (replaced a 2007 MacBook Pro that recently passed away) and am overwhelmed by the quality of display, speed, sleekness (it's very light and attractive), and overall package.Samsung is able to keep prices low because they make a lot of the components for their computers. This computer would easily sell for $700 or $800 as an ASUS. The only hesitation I had was with AMD, but only because I have only ever worked on Intels. So far, I can't see any difference. Apparently, AMD processors are great for gaming (which I don't do, I use my computer for business, writing, productivity, and photo editing) but can be \"unsteady,\" according to a friend of mine. What he meant by that, he couldn't tell me. I think it's just Intel name recognition, or maybe someone could clarify in a comment?Overall, this computer deserves 5 out of 5 stars in its own right.

The fact that this computer is less than $500 (I bought it for $399 at Best Buy) is really startling.I would recommend it with no reservations.***UPDATE***The computer started freezing and crashing 2 weeks after I bought.

High quality construction with the single (probably minor) exception that holding it one-handed in your left hand results in some scary cracking sounds.2. Value - This AMD quad core is solidly near a Core i5 in performance at a Core i3 price.3. Battery life - I haven't run actual tests like playing DVDs on battery, but it's definitely better than I expected at this price with this battery.  I suspect it's due to power improvements in the CPU/GPU, screen, etc.  I'm getting 5 hours easy of mixed usage.Bad1. Keyboard - I can't stand the chiclet keyboard.  Maybe I psyched myself out because I thought it might be a problem, but it's been 3 weeks and I'm still having a really hard time getting used to it.  Read the other reviews though because it looks like I may be the anomaly.2. Touch pad - Nice touch pad, but it's some type of multi-touch and I'm constantly resizing things on my screen by accident.  I'm sure it can be turned off but I haven't found it.3.  Screen - This LED screen has good brightness, but to me it's blurry compared to a traditional (LCD?) laptop screen.Summary - I almost gave it 3 stars because the keyboard annoys me so badly and it took me twice as long to type this review as it should.

I am an avid Apple user, from phones to the iPads to the desktops, our house is full of Apple stuff, so when I set out to find me a \"beat-em-up\" work computer, I wanted something basic, and didn't want to pay the price for it.Enter in, the Samsung 305. Found this at bestbuy, got a bargain deal on it for $430, and have been in love ever since. I also recently last week traded in my iPhone 4s for a Samsung Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. And I will be righting a review on how I should have made the switch sooner, love that thing.So far I have been impressed with the Samsung electronics quality, reliability and overall style. This little notebook is a little powerhouse man...Compared to my last macbook, this thing packs a punch for a crazy price. With the quad-core 1.5GHZ processor, it is on the lower end as far as GHz speed compared to other computers, but those quad-cores back it up very impressively.  The 4GB that you get off the bat is a much welcomed plus! And the great thing with windows computers that I forgot, from not having used a windows in so long, is the updatability, unlock macbooks or macs in general, where you pretty much need a Apple tech to install new stuff, windows, and especially this samsung is very userfriendly when it comes to upgrading hardware.But so far, I don't think I will be needing to tweak this bad boy in a long time. Here's a quick summary of the pros...Pros: Sleek, good looking notebook. Fast processor coupled with decent amount of RAM makes this a multi-tasker on a budget's dream. I've run multiple browsers, office, mail, chat, and even game clients at once with no problems or slow down (also with Kapersky in the background).This thing can even game pretty decently! That is always a downfall of most eco-frienly notebooks. They can do the basics, but when you want to play a game that's beyond a free web-based flash game, they fail. Well man, I installed Steampower just for shizz and giggz, and this thing ran Counter-Strike beautifully, and seamlessly, with no frame freeze ups or anything. Makes me excited to try some other games on it. Granted CS Source is an oldy, but i'm sure some new games out there can run nicely on this thing with a few in-game tweaks for graphics.With a 15.6\" Samsung patent amulate screen, this thing shows movies and pictures quite nicely. I had to do some adjusting, because it seemed a little \"washed out\" at first, but after messing with contrast and stuff, it looked awesome.Cons: really, nothing to say. For this pricepoint, there are really no cons about this thing. The only con I can think of, is that samsung repeatedly likes to venture for normal specs. Most laptops are 15.4\" making buying hard shell or packs for them on the go, universal and easy. But because they had to add those .2\" its a little more exclusive, and hard to find. But with a little digging, and even on here (Amazon) you can find some cool protective gel's or backpacks for it.In the end, the price on here is a little more than what I got it for, but I would always recommend an Amazon purchase, I recommend this little badboy to anyone that wants a PC based computer on a budget!

It allows a comparison between the old cal and new so it remembers there was an old calibration but doesn't allow you to load that on reboot.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast and economic", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R1QF9UZO9BTZ10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop for the price.

It's made out of cheap plastic, which is fine as well.  It seems to operate decently, and we use an external USB wireless mouse, so if the touchpad acts up it doesn't bother us so far.The real reason that I gave this thing a single star rating is because the wireless adapter is terrible.  It keeps disconnecting from the router, I'm sitting on a different laptop right next to this Samsung and am not having a single problem.  I've updated the drivers using Windows built in driver search.  I tried looking for updated drivers on Samsung's site but it appears Windows has the latest.  I tried searching for Atheros drivers directly from Atheros but all I can find is a bunch of scammy sites that want you to install some program to download drivers.  I decided to just buy some cheap external USB wireless adapter thinking I would fix the problem but that doesn't seem to work either.I discovered this problem after we had the computer for a month. We are moving overseas in 1.5 weeks (which is why we bought new laptops) so I can't exactly send this to a repair center or anything, and Amazon won't take it back.  Very upsetting.

It could be interpreted to mean junk and that's just what this laptop is.Pros: Nice ergonomics, but then there's the computer...Cons: H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E battery. BIOS freezes. Truly lousy support. Touchpad.Summary: Round #1- Samsung usually makes good stuff. So I took a chance, especially at a good 'price point'. I'm an idiot. The battery is h-o-r-r-i-b-l-e! With no peripherals attached, no programs going except a browser, and the screen dimmed to about 40%, I get way less than an hour on a charge, 46-57 minutes. Called Samsung for support and I have to ship it back, 7-10 days. Now who believes that! She takes my email and says she'll email me a label right away. You got it- 12 hours later, no label. And, yes, I checked my spam folder.Round #2 - Upgrading the RAMOh, a sub $400 laptop from samsung but only 4 gb ram. There's that 'price point' stuff again. No biggie, I'll just put in another 4 gb. Samsung's user manual says be sure to use same maker and timing for both chips. Easy. I order 2X4gb by Corsair from Amazon. The manual says 8500, so that's what I order. While waiting for the mem to come, I decide to open it up. I find a Samsung 10600 4 gb chip. Return the chips and order same brand but 10600. I boot up but it'll only read 4 gb. Turns out it only takes samsung chips. Thanks, Samsung, for telling me in the manual that the chips have to be SAMSUNG chips.Round #3 - BIOS freezes. That's a new one on me after building computers since 1988. I haven't investigated that one yet, but given the 'price point'...Round #4 - I started writing this 15 minutes ago. The battery was at 50%. now it's down to 22%. Ouch, that 'price point' bit me hard this timeRound #5 - When touched, the touch pad will not show the cursor where you wanted it. Actually it is there, Samsung just wants to entertain with an new game- Touchpad Magician.For some reason, the cursor moves to where you want it, but it's invisible because if you start typing, the letters show up where you want them.Think hard before you believe any stuff about great price point and value on this one.

If a drive is going to fail, it will usually do it right away. I was thinking no big deal, Ill send it back in and get it replaced. Thats where Samsungs terrible support came in.I tried to get support from Samsung, they gave me live chat, they said I just needed to reinstall Windows with a system restore to solve my hard drive issue. I went ahead and did a system restore and of course it did not solve the problem and in fact it froze while trying to install Windows. I emailed them back, said I did a system restore as told by your support in a chat session and it did not solve the problem, can I get an RMA # to have it serviced ? The emailed back and said first do a system restore on the laptop that should correct the problem, showing they do not even fully read the emails.It took several more email and chat sessions when they told me to goto a web page and file a warranty claim. I went to the site, filled out all the info and hit send, it sat there for 45 minutes saying submitting and never got anywhere. I tried it again the next day, again the page hung and just said submitting for an hour. After a few more times I gave up, ordered my own drive from newegg and problem solved. Overall I spent about a week trying to get samsung to fix their laptop before I gave up, they must hope that's what happens.The battery also is much shorter than they claim, I think it said 5.2 hours, after 3 months of only being used 1 or 2 times a week it's only lasting around 3 hours now.Other than those issues, it's fairly fast, keyboard seems well built and less likely to loose keys than other keyboards Ive had.", "Date": "January 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Packaging, Strictly packaging...", "Author": "J.

Or, at least I couldn't.I spent 2 hours getting it set up, checking out that it would connect to the net, arranging some of the system preferences etc. then I finally went online and was typing in a forum...... when I discovered that every time I typed the cursor would suddenly go back a word or two or three and start typing from the middle of the sentence instead of continuing where I left off. So it was as if, on this sentence, it would suddenly start writing this last word back where it says \"\"it would suddenly\" instead of continuing on from \"instead\", for example.However: THIS IS NOT A BAD UNIT, IT'S A **BAD DESIGN!**The thing is that if you rest your hands on the edge of the laptop instead of holding your hands up in the air, as you rest your hands, the bottom left part of your thumb rests on the touch pad and that causes it to highlight parts of the sentence and so it begins typing that part of the sentence that you've inadvertently highlighted. THERE IS NO SOLUTION FOR THIS other than to hold your hands up off the computer as you type. Indeed this is best for your hands/wrists but I do not use that style of posturing my hands so this laptop (and perhaps others?) simply will not work for me.In my view this is a very faulty design because I'm pretty sure a LOT of people rest their hands as they type. So if you do - if you don't hold the base of your thumb up off the computer as you type - then DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP.It may be a very good laptop otherwise, I don't know. It seemed like a good value and has great features and great reviews. I guess judging from all those great reviews, most buyers do NOT rest their hands on the laptop body as they type so they will not be inadvertently touching that part of the touch pad with the bottom part of their thumb, thus causing it to type erratically.So if you are looking at this computer just do a lot of typing with it in your normal posture before buying it to make sure you do not have this problem. I would not recommend buying it on line until you go somewhere and physically use it to type from a normal posture so you can see if you too have this problem typing with it. If the bottom part of your thumb - the fleshy part towards your palm -  touches the touch pad you will probably have problems with it as I did.Too bad Samsung didn't put the touch pad further up, make it a little smaller and avoid this problem.For what it's worth I also did not care for the touch pad in general. I found it to be too sensitive at times and not sensitive enough at other times. When moving my finger across it sometimes it would inadvertently grab something on the desktop or page I was on and open it when I did not really tap the touchpad to make it open anything. I have had this problem with other laptops - most notably an older model HP - and it can be very very annoying over time. Also this touch pad does NOT have any control panel that will allow you to adjust its sensitivity. Many - like the HP mentioned - do not. Next time I'm going to find out if the model I am interested in does or not have a touchpad adjustment and if it doesn't I may not buy that model. (I DID try to adjust the mouse settings but that does not affect the sensitivity of the touch pad in the way that I needed it to.)So basically this Samsung laptop has TWO major problems with the Touchpad.BUYER BEWARE!", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "blue screen of death in 45 min.", "Author": "Ripley7700", "ReviewID": "R16R9VR6AN5SEL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Need I write more?
