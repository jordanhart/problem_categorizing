An outstanding bargain!!", "Author": "double dub", "ReviewID": "R6KEBC63UT807", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "To give some background, this is my first Chromebook.  I own a PC which I use for gaming and editing video files; and I've owned an '08 MacBook (recently died, which prompted this purchase) and a '12 MacBook Air (donated to Mom), both of which I primarily used to surf the web, check email, watch youtube, and play music and video files.I needed to replace my MacBook so I researched my options, and based on my needs I narrowed my choices down to the Acer C720 and HP Chromebook11.  I read through the limited reviews available at the time, and the overall theme was that the C720 offered greater performance over build/screen quality while the HP11 offered better build/screen quality over performance.  I've always valued function over form so the C720 it was.I'm glad to report that, IMO, the claims against the C720's screen - some of which made it sound like it was a total POS - are unfounded as I feel it's as good as my Macbook Air's screen.  Of course, the build quality isn't the best, but it's not like it feels like a flimsy toy by any means.  The keys and touchpad feel thinner, lighter, and of lesser quality than my MacBook but still adequate; and for $250 it's a solidly built machine that meets or exceeds all of my expectations.At the time of purchase the available reviews had not covered whether this machine could meet my main criteria (detailed below in order of importance), and I am pleased to report that the C720 passes with flying colors on all counts!  (Note, my '08 MacBook could not play 1080p video from my Sony Action Cam or GoPro (without the help of Plex Software), a limitation of the CPU/GPU.)1. smooth playback of raw 1080p video files from my Sony ActionCam and GoPro 3 (1080p HDMI output to HDTV also works great!)2. efficiently browse the web - no realistic limitation on open tabs/windows (thanks to the 4gb of ram)3. compact size (the C720 feels just slightly heavier than my Macbook Air and a hair larger in all dimensions)4. great battery life (based on a full charge and screen at 70% brightness, the battery indicator esimates 7 hours of use)5. ability to continue using all of my external HD's (some laptops I've used before don't play nice)Overall, I am super impressed with the C720, and IMO at $250 it's an outstanding bargain for a very capable machine.  Assuming your primary use is similar to mine - surfing the web while on the couch / in bed, and playing music and videos - this laptop will surprisingly meet most if not all of your needs.  The Intel Celeron Haswell chip, while dumbed-down, enables this Chromebook to match the performance of my MacBook Air for all my intents and purposes and even surpasses my older MacBook in video playback.  I'm officially a Chromebook convert, and I don't see myself missing my MacBook anymore!  I'll update this review as I develop further impressions but so far I am very happy with my decision to go with the C720.11/15/13 UPDATE:I'm even more impressed with this machine after having spent another 3.5 weeks with it. Not only can I stream web content in 1080p to my TV via HDMI, but simultaneously on my C720 display I am able to stream 1080p content and browse in multiple tabs all at once with no discernible hit in performance. That's two 1080p streams to separate displays while still being able to smoothly browse the web. The C720 is a beast!", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Acer C720 - Function over form", "Author": "Cenile D. Mentia", "ReviewID": "R17H1HJBJ7NTCK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "==UPDATES==01/09/14 - Added in some additional notesThis review is going to assume that you're OK with the idea of a Chromebook - that you're OK with using pretty much nothing but the Chrome browser. You won't be able to use Skype or Microsoft Office here, neither will you be able to use things like Final Cut Pro or Photoshop. However, you'd be surprised at how powerful some of the things you find online have become: there are substitutes for programs like Skype and Microsoft Office, found in the form of Google's Hangouts and their productivity suite. More complex programs like Photoshop have yet to be replicated online, but there are basic photo and video editing software now as well. If you're OK with this idea cloud computing which some have named the \"next generation of computing\", then I encourage you to buy a Chromebook. They're optimized for the web and only the web. You won't have to deal with viruses and updates are automatic. It's simple, it's fast, and it's efficient. But only if you can handle the limitations.The Acer C720With the C720, Acer has fixed the most glaring issues of its previous generation of Chromebooks - most noticeably replacing the HDD with a SSD, decreasing the boot time to a mere 7 seconds, and upgrading the processor to a 4th generation power efficient Haswell processor, improving the battery life to an impressive 8 hours. With a $249 price tag, these specifications alone makes this a tempting buy, but let's look at some of the other factors first.The ExternalsTo keep a long story short, it's not great. Compared to the catchy design of the HP 11, Acer's Chromebook looks kind of ugly, It's all gray color scheme is pretty boring, and the bottom of the Chromebook is filled with vents (see picture above). That being said, it's not a bad design either. It's thin with a slightly tapered finish, and it's light and easy to hold. Looks aside, this Chromebook is perfectly functional and definitely an upgrade if you're coming from the previous generation. It's actually pretty sturdy - it doesn't bend easily and it seems like it can take a light beating. I've been traveling around with it and I don't feel it at all in my backpack.The screen has a 1366x768 resolution with a matte finish. It has poor viewing angles, but it's perfectly fine if you're using the Chromebook alone. I'm also not sure if it's really anti-glare: you'll still have to crank up the brightness if you want to use it outside. The keyboard works pretty well - if you're used to previous Chromebook keyboards or Apple keyboards, you'll be used to this one. Keep in mind that the caps lock key has been replaced by a `search' button, though you can always remap it in the settings if you miss it. The clickable touchpad also works well - it's surprisingly responsive and the 2 finger scrolling works well. Note that when I first got the Chromebook, there was some kind of coating that made it kind of hard to use, but after ~2 hours of using the touchpad, it became much more responsive. You use a 2 finger click for right clicking, and you can also do a 3 finger swipe to switch tabs. The smoothness of the multi-touch capabilities really surprised me here. Also, regarding the webcam, it's exactly what you'd expect from a $250 laptop. It's listed as an \"HD Webcam\", whatever that means. It'll work well enough for Google Hangouts, but don't expect to look like a supermodel. However, it's definitely a bit better than the HP 11's webcam - it's not as grainy and it works a little bit better under low light situations. Speakers are also pretty loud for such a small notebook, but the sound quality is average.This Chromebook also comes with a variety of input/output ports (1 USB 3.0, 1 USB 2.0, 1 HDMI, 1 SD, 1 Kensington lock, 1 Mic/Headphone), much more than the HP 11, and I've found the abundance of ports to be quite useful. Finally, note that there is a fan in this Chromebook, but it's barely noticeable: you have to lean in close and be in a quiet room before you can hear it.The InternalsThis is where this Chromebook really shines. For $249, we're used to getting a sluggish computer, but that is not the case with this Chromebook. The Intel processor and a generous 4GB of RAM really shines here, and it shows in the performance. It can handle multiple tabs with no problem and runs 1080p videos and graphically heavy websites smoothly. Unlike the ARM based Chromebooks, there are no stutters or pauses which might distract you from your work and research. Once I used this Chromebook, it was really hard to go back to the HP 11. The battery life lasted around 8 hours for me, but the best part is that it only takes around 2 hours to fully charge, which is pretty fast in my opinion.All in all, I love Chromebooks because of their simplicity and speed. It works so well for those who just need to surf the web and do some basic writing or note taking and I'd recommend everyone to give it a try before dismissing the idea. Chrome OS is still essentially a web browser, but it's evolved to a point where it's so cleverly disguised that it doesn't feel like one anymore. Once you use it, you'd be surprised at how much we depend on the web these days. Personally, I've been waiting for a Chromebook which combines good battery life and performance with a decent design, and I think this model does just that (even if it falls a bit short on design). This would be the perfect model for those who prefer function over form, and for $249, it's an absolute bargain.Some side notes regarding the other models:- Acer recently released a C720 model with 2GB of RAM for $199. The decrease in RAM is the only difference, making this a pretty good deal as well. These seem to be selling out quite fast, because every time I check, they aren't in stock. Also, I haven't seen the 4GB model in stock anywhere, so I'm not sure what happened to that. To be honest, 2GB of RAM is good enough for a lightweight OS like Chrome OS-you probably can't open as many tabs (I'm talking 15+ here), but everything else should work just as well as the 4GB model. Other models (such as the HP 11 & the Samsung Series 3) comes with 2GB as well, and most people are happy with them.- I've used the Samsung Series 3, the Acer C7, the CR-48 (beta-test model) and the HP 11, and this model trumps all of them in terms of performance.- The screen on the Hp 11 is the best out of all 3, with the best contrast, brightness and viewing angles. The HP 11 has been taken down from all stores now though due to an issue with the chargers overloading/overheating. Luckily, there's nothing wrong with this model.- This model has the best battery life for an 11 inch chromebook, though the 14 inch Hp chromebook is supposed to have 9.5 hours.- Also, for those interested, this Chromebook comes with the standard perks of 100GB of Google Drive for 2 years, 60 days of Google play music, and 12 sessions of GoGo in-flight internet.Feel free to ask any questions below in the comment section!", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Chromebook for the road warrior", "Author": "D. Nielson", "ReviewID": "RSF7T3MMZHRMB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My new Chromebook is so much faster than my last 2012 Samsung model.  So many people are making the comparison to the new HP 11.Yes, the Acer is heavier and not as sleek as the HP 11, however there are some major differences to consider.  The Acer C720 has the Haswell-U chip not the anemic ARM processor.  The speed is night and day.  I got so frustrated with the Samsung  Chromebook watching the circle spinning to load pages.  No longer, the Acer zips loading pages almost instantly.  Getting 4 GB of RAM for the quarter of the price for a Macbook Air is amazing.  The display is more than adequate.  I loathe glossy screens.  Having a matte screen is the best feature of this Chromebook.  Sitting out by the pool on a sunny day writing this review with no glare.  Seeing this bright screen on a sunny day is not an issue.  Reviewers mention the HP 11  with it's IPS screen is far superior, I would say no thanks to a highly reflective glossy screen.  Who sits in dark room the best conditions for a glossy screen?  Matte is where it's at.  Too bad Apple doesn't get that either.  This Chromebook is perfect for the road warrior.  Under 3 lbs, with 8 hours of battery life, I don't have to search the airports for a power source or think about charging all of the time.  Also, getting the 100 GB of Google drive for two years, and the 12 Gogo inflight internet passes is worth the price of the Chromebook.  The Chrome platform is user friendly and boots within seconds.  Having the side SD card slot allows me to pop in a 32 GB card where I park movies to watch on the road.  Video playback on this model far superior than any ARM Chromebook.  For the price, this is the one to get especially for the wonderful matte screen that is better than my old Samsung Chromebook, it is matte also but the colors are a bit washed out.  Some people have complained about the design with the vents at the bottom.  This one has the Haswell chip people and requires some cooling unlike the slow ARM that is completely sealed.  With this kind of speed it is not an issue for me.  The size is relatively the same as the old Samsung and HP 11 only thicker and weighs a bit more.  For me, speed and battery life trumps slow and sleek.  The track pad on the Acer is much more responsive than the Samsung.  The keyboard makes a bit more clicking sounds and seems a bit cramped compared to the Samsung.  Something I can deal with considering the speed.  The biggest plus is not spending a thousand dollars on a Macbook Air but getting similar specs for a quarter of the price.  Very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Comparison to Samsung Chromebook", "Author": "J. Henderson", "ReviewID": "R2F2EO9DTPTVHA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've used Samsung's 11 inch chromebook extensively, and though I enjoyed it, I was open to upgrading to one of the newer chromebooks being released this fall. After using the Acer C720 for a week, here are my thoughts about how it compares to the Samsung.Speed: Without question, there is a significant improvement in performance, and this is the number one reason I upgraded. While the Samsung was adequate with most tasks, it sometimes struggles with streaming video, and can feel a bit sluggish with opening some websites. The C720 on the other hand is almost on par with my desktop PC for all web browsing tasks.Build Quality: Probably the most disappointing aspect of the C720. Right away, it just doesn't feel as nice or solid in your hands as does the Samsung. It's also not as nice looking, but it's not ugly either. It's just marginally bigger and heavier, but not by much. The C720 doesn't feel flimsy though, and it has the same amount of ports and outputs. On another note, the C720 has a fan where as the Samsung is fanless and completely silent. I haven't really noticed the C720 fan at all to be honest, even when under demanding tasks like streaming video. The keyboard is fine, both are equally good. The touchpad, however, is my biggest gripe. It's noisy, feels really cheap, and occasionally doesn't register clicks.Screen: Very similar, though the C720 looks a bit better in my opinion. Seems to have better color saturation and doesn't look as washed out. They are both matte, and have exactly the same size and resolution. The viewing angles are maybe a little better if there is any difference at all, and the brightness is still pretty adequate.Battery Life: Much better on the C720. For regular browsing it will get at least 9+ hours, and even when streaming video will still get more than 6 hours (Samsung would only get about 3 hours when streaming video).There you go. If you are comparing a Samsung Chromebook or already have one and are looking to upgrade, I hope this helps. The C720 wasn't quite the slam dunk I was expecting it to be, but I am still pretty happy with it.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Chromebook in the market", "Author": "Vivek Chaudhary", "ReviewID": "R2OX13YSNCELGU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got Samsung Chromebook last year and have been using it for about a year.

Orders of magnitude faster than Samsung Chromebook (and HP Chromebook-11 because it also uses the same crappy ARM chip)2) Awesome battery life.

I love this laptop for $249, upgrading to more RAM is not needed.  Video streaming on Crunchyroll is great, there is no buffer, stop & play is almost flawless, skipping to different time is very quick, the image is very sharp, and doesn't run hot.  With 4 GB of RAM, it is quick and doesn't need to upgrade.  Boot up is in-line with the Samsung Chromebook as it will boot up in less than 10 seconds and shuts down in 1 second.  You don't really need a big hard drive since everything will be saved to Google Drive.  If you thought about buying a cheap machine for web surfing, document & spreadsheet, you should compare all your options, Windows full version, Windows RT, iPad, Android, & Chromebook.  Just remember, Chromebook will never slow down as the Chrome OS is installed and updated constantly.  I just saw that the Microsoft Surface 2 w/ Windows RT will also have Outlook.

Ive been using a Chromebook since the Series 5 first came out in 2011.Everything about this Chromebook is what you would expect from a Chromebook *except* the keyboard and touchpad. The display is not bad, it's anti-glare, it doesn't require too much movement to correct 'washout', it's also fairly bright. The speed, is fantastic. The Haswell CPU and really the GPU are the highlights of this Chromebook, as well as 4gb of RAM. I had no trouble tab-streaming Hulu in HD to my Chromecast with very little heat or fan noise. The body of the Chromebook is light, it's 'plasticky', which is to be expected from a $250 laptop, but the lid/top is very nice to touch. It leaves few if any fingerprints. The speakers are louder than most other Chromebooks. They have loud mids, little to no bass and crackling highs.My biggest problem with this Chromebook is the keyboard and touchpad. If you have ever used an Acer C7-series Chromebook before, you know how the keyboard feels. It's clacky, loud, not very well muted (like the Samsung Chromebooks) and is smaller than most other Chromebooks. The touchpad is similar to the C710, but was either defective or 'rattling' on my unit. It felt as if it weren't attached properly, when I would tap it, it felt like there was a spring depressing before it actually started a depress of a click. If you tap instead of clicking, this is fairly annoying. Instead of being silent, it sounds like a click. I'm not sure if this was just my unit, it was one of the first shipped units (recieved it Monday, Oct 21st), either way this was a deal breaker for me.

This is the exact combination of speed, quality and price I've been looking for.  It's slightly bulkier but is still really small and feels great to use.  I'm running Ubuntu with a window manager alongside Chrome OS and have about 40 tabs open (and a bunch of other apps) and haven't noticed any performance issues.  This is the chromebook I've been waiting for.Differences from the Samsung ARM Chromebook:- The keys are less wiggly, this keyboard is nicer to type on and better protects from small amounts of liquid spilling on it- The trackpad is much more sensitive  ***EDIT: I can operate this laptop really easily without a mouse after learning the keyboard shortcuts -- very efficient.  Also I didn't find this in any documentation, but this trackpad is even 3 finger sensitive for swiping across tabs.  Great user experience!***- The screen is a bit nicer- This thing has a fan which runs nearly silent but makes it slightly bulkier (still only 2-3 lbs).  Because of this, there are vents across the bottom and rear, and the rear footpads are slightly raised (facilitating heat exchange). All this differentiates the feel of it from the Sammy ARM (which is literally just a board and no moving parts).- The footpads are rounded which makes it less grippy to the surface below.  To fix this, drag the laptop around a bit to wear off a tiny amount of the rubber coating.- The Acer is MUCH faster.  Even with swap enabled on the Samsung, it doesn't come anywhere near the Acer in speed.  I'm more productive on it.- The battery lasts about 2 hours longer (running the same apps, doing the same tasks) despite the fan(s), etc.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "This thing is incredible...but not without shortcomings", "Author": "Delta \"Dr. Technology Man\"", "ReviewID": "R8KOBSAC388VR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "NOTE: Check this review's comments for information on installing and setting up Ubuntu on this machine.Since the negatives are always the most important part of a review I'm going to start out with the problems I had and the things I don't like about this Chromebook. That being said this thing is incredible and I am extremely happy with this purchase.When I first got it I had the infamous \"raised\" touch pad problem. It wasn't really a big deal but it decreased sensitivity making it harder to use sometimes. However within 30 minutes of getting it out of the box the distance decreased significantly and moreso the more I use it. Later the day I got it it was completely gone but has come and gone since, each time becoming less noticeable. I'm not sure what the heck the problem was but as of now it is completely gone and hasn't come back. In case this helps anyone else, the only thing I did was put pressure around the track pad area a lot the first couple days I had it and while it didn't have an immediate effect it may have caused it to get fixed. In any case, not a problem after a couple days!The second complaint I have is also about the track pad which seems to not be slick when you first get it. My fingers would stick to it a lot and would cause me to lose control, however I guess after getting it broken in it is very smooth and workable now. No big deal either way.The last thing is that the 16 gig SSD. While it normally isn't a big deal I bought this to also use Ubuntu on it and with all my personal necessary software it has about 5.5 gigs of room left. Not too shabby, but it would be nice to have at least a little more headroom there.Now onto the good stuff. This thing is FAST and works great in every way. The keyboard is very similar to the HP Chrombook 11, Samsung 550 and Samsung ARM notebooks I've used before. After the problems the touch pad works great and makes usability amazing compared to ones that don't recognize 2 fingers (like scrolling, which makes this much more usable than single finger only pads). The screen works great and is higher quality than the other 2 Samsungs I've used (though not the HP, however the HP's screen is NOT that much better. The keyboard works great, however it took just a day of getting used to it for heavier typing. The speakers aren't bad either and they get surprisingly loud. Also the battery life is RIDICULOUS. I used it for 5 hours straight studying and installing Ubuntu and all the packages I needed using crouton and it was only at 50% battery by the time I stopped. This is why I bought the Chromebook.Also Ubuntu on this thing works great. I'm currently running Saucy using Crouton and it doesn't seem to affect the battery life or performance at all based on which OS I'm using. Another cool thing is when you switch to the other OS the other continues to run doing whatever process or playing music or whatever that it was doing before. This makes it surprisingly easy to multitask and allows for an instant backup if I crash Ubuntu (which I have already...my fault lol).This thing is just plain a workhorse and it hits all the parts that make this a very usable Chromebook/Linux Laptop. Sure you can go with the slightly more expensive HP Chromebook 11, but that thing is ridiculously slow comparatively and doesn't have the ports or battery life. In any case I recommend checking out a few before purchasing so you can get what you want, but for my needs this one is absolutely perfect and at an amazing price too.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply the best !!!", "Author": "dragswarup", "ReviewID": "RUN96TTMZB0K4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Acer C720 chromebook is the best Chromebook as of now and probably the best portable computer I have ever used !!I pre-ordered this Chromebook and was lucky enough to get is within a week, unfortunately now there is again a 3 week's wait. This Chromebook seems to be in high demand !! Obviously has to be , cause it packs so much punch within it, like a fast HDD , better memory and a nice processor and that too at a very affordable price.I have a Note 10.1 Tab, a heavy HP laptop ,and a vaio netbook, and generally I find myself on Blackboard learn for classes , checking mails , calendar , docs, FB etc , basically everything I do is online. Galaxy note is an awesome equipment for a student and helps in taking notes and annotating slides etc , however its very cumbersome using it, if I need to type something or finish an assignment or simply browse the internet. Its not possible to carry the Laptop and a power chord along with it everywhere I go cause its too heavy to be comfortably carried along and the netbook is too slow and takes a lot of time to open up anything , even though what I want is to I just wanna open a few tabs . So I thought, if I always spend most of my time on a browser ( chrome is my favorite ) why not just buy a thing which would just have Chrome and nothing else and do the job which I mostly do 95% of my time quickly and efficiently. Chromebook was the answer !! Especially this latest piece of amazing equipment having the best configuration among all Chromebooks available today in the market of similar price range.A few things I liked about it :Its Fast !!! it does not take me even 3 seconds to get back to where i left if i just make my chromebook sleep, by the time I lift screen the Chromebook is up and running, not like my laptop or netbook where i just keep waiting and looking at the mouse pointer and that irritating circle !! Even if i shut it down completely , it does not take more than a few seconds for it to startup, that's the most impressive part.Its Light !!! It's such a sweet piece of thin and light machine, that I can carry it anywhere just like my Tablet or along with my tablet. I make hand written notes on my tablet and they are synced to google drive , which I open up whenever and wherever I want to read them again on the chromebook.Easy to view !!! The matte screen is fantastic , and makes it so easy to read under the bright lights of an auditorium . Now i do not need to bend my head in weird angle or move the computer at different angles just to read whats on the screen , makes life easier !!Doesn't heat up !!! Surprisingly even though there are vents and I expected it to give out some heat its very cool underneath and I did not feel a thing on my lap even though it was there for a few hours , unlike my laptop or netbook where I need to keep a fan underneath it to protect my lap and my balls from frying ;)Goes On an On !!! The battery backup is awesome.. The first time i used it out of the box it gave me 4 hrs straight with all the new stiff and experimenting going on , then i charged it completely and i got almost 6.5 hrs or maybe a bit more. I expect it to increase a bit more after a few cycles of complete discharging and recharging. So overall im pretty satisfied with the one shot work capacity and its good to go for a days work at least :)Sexy Keyboard !!! The keyboard is so cool , it feels great typing on it which i am doing right now !! no tap sounds and really smooth keysRobust Built !!

I owned two Samsung Series 3 Chromebooks and bought an Acer C7 C710-2834 for my sister. This compares favorably to the later in the ergonomics and looks department. My biggest issue with this has been the loudness of the fan, which also used to emit a high-pitched whine for about a month after I purchased it.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly Good", "Author": "B.L.", "ReviewID": "RP6MAB270147F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I want to say up front that I really wasn't expecting this to work as nicely as it has turned out to work. I was thinking that it would be a device that does okay at a few things, but ends up feeling pretty limited. In actuality, it's managed to really surprise me with how much of my computing time it has taken over. I've actually been finding myself reaching for it when I'm sitting at my desk with my (much more powerful and running MS Windows 7) desktop.The limitations here are really important to consider. You can not install a whole lot of extra software onto the device (by default, anyway, with some tinkering you could make it behave like a more standard Linux-style device). You're not going to be installing MS Office 2013 on here. Though, if you really wanted, you could use Office 365. (On that note, though, it'd be worth giving Google Docs and other options a chance. For most purposes, like writing school papers and working on resumes, the 'free' options are more than adequate.)What the device can do, is anything that you're currently doing through a Chrome window on a desktop or another laptop. For a lot of people this will mean social networking, video calls, taking online MOOC classes, reading the news, writing on blogs, shopping online, and that kind of thing. For a lot of people, there are enough Internet-based services that this'll probably cover everything you do with a computer regularly.Speed - This thing runs extremely fast. 4GB is a lot of memory on something that isn't doing a whole lot more than running a web browser. The processor keeps up with its needs very well. The Haswell architecture has a really good reputation for power-efficiency, and I haven't really been bothered by battery limitations. A lot of devices start threatening to cut me off entirely at 10% or so of power, to ensure they have enough in reserve to not lose anything in storage. This seems content to run down to 5% or so before it starts to nudge me about a potential problem.Storage - 16gb is pretty small, but you get a decent chunk of Google Drive storage for 2 years (100GB) as part of the deal. You can also easily bolster it with USB thumb drives and SD or MicroSD cards, or even full-sized external hard drives.Doing More - When I have wanted to do things that the Chromebook can't, there's a remote desktop feature in Chrome. I flipped it on and basically used the chromebook as a remote client for my desktop. The desktop did all the work of running the software that the portable device couldn't, and I could see and interact with everything that was happening remotely.Video Out - You can get video to another screen with the HDMI port, but this feature was working strangely. It didn't seem willing to go to 1920x1080 for me, and so the resolution was never quite right. This may have been something to do with the fact that I was hooking it up to a TV rather than a device designed to be a monitor, and I hope it's something they eventually fix in the software so that it works more smoothly.ChomeCast - If you have a Chromecast, you can easily 'cast' your Chrome tabs on the Chomebook to a TV that way. Easier than using the HDMI-out, really. It only shows the tab and not your mouse cursor, which makes it impractical as a way to totally use the device with a TV as the screen. For watching videos or reading a lot of text on web pages, though, it works very nicely.Keyboard/Mouse - The trackpad works fine and includes gestures (for example, 2 fingers on the trackpad dragging downward is scroll down). The keyboard is full-sized and reasonably comfortable. It took a few days to adjust and for my typo-rate to drop, but things are fine now. There is bluetooth support, and you absolutely can hook up an external bluetooth keyboard and mouse (I'm sure this also applies to USB if you wanted). I did it. It worked fine.Internet access - Wireless only, no ethernet port (it's not really big enough to have an ethernet port.). You might be able to do wired internet using a USB adapter, I'm not sure. Keep in mind that having Internet access is pretty important to really using this thing, though. It's designed to be an Internet-heavy device.Value - This is what make's the Chromebooks really shine. It comes with the previously mentioned Google Drive space, and also passes for a plane-based Internet service. If you're someone who uses those things anyway and is paying for them, buying the chromebook pretty much pays for itself and it'd almost be silly not to try one out. (If you don't use those things, obviously it's not such a big deal.) Otherwise, the value you get for the simple hardware that's included is still good.Security - And for a few people I know, this is going to be the main reason I recommend a Chromebook. I think we all probably have one or two people in our lives who really aren't comfortable with computers, don't take naturally to figuring out what's safe to click and what's not, and never install patches. Often, they just use the computer for email, a little social networking, and maybe some browser-based games. These devices do those things well, and their limitations are actually a huge benefit because they auto-patch and they don't let you install the kinds of things that often lead to horrible virus infections. For some people, having one of these will work out far better than having a Windows Desktop with much more powerful hardware, because it does what they need to do and refuses to do the things that might get them in trouble.There's a lot to digest there, but the upshot is that this is a really surprisingly nice device. It has a few issues that I've come across and it's definitely not perfect, but it really does well at the things it was intended to do. On the other hand, it's definitely not for people who need to install Windows software, who don't have an Internet connection, or who have the skill and motivation to maintain tight control over their own computers.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "You will not regret this purchase", "Author": "Tenaciouswho", "ReviewID": "R2C688PA0TD34M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Chromebook exceeded my expectations and is actually a LOT of fun to use.

add a chromecast accessory, and my hdtv turns into a desktop monitor. easy!one of the centerpieces of the chromebook (imo) is the ability to share and edit various documents through google drive. the google drive office suite, including docs, spreadsheet, and presentation, offers free versions of the office programs we've all used for the last 20+ years. the google versions are stripped out somewhat, but still offer most of the regular functionality you'd expect. also, the google office products are compatible with most standard office file types, including microsoft, openoffice, and libreoffice (with the addition of an extension). and when you're ready to store your documents, google drive offers you free cloud storage. this is key, because there's a very limited amount of onboard storage with the acer. i've been using drive for well over a year now. i use it to keep inventory spreadsheets updated at my bar, and also to make changes to tracking documents for my coin collection and my ingress user activities. all these things are accessible from my desktops at home and work, and my android phone, and any changes are automatically and instantly synced across all those devices. adding in the chromebook has given me an interface that's easier to use than my android for making changes, and obviously more portable than my desktops. not to mention cheaper, lighter, and longer-running than a standard laptop.another option i have added is the installation a linux distro (gnome gui with raring), which actually makes this chromebook an (almost) fully-functional linux laptop. with the limited onboard storage of only 16gb, my linux install must remain pretty light, but there is also a storage upgrade coming out soon for this acer. with 64gb or even just 32gb, this machine becomes much more versatile in that area.bottom line. this is a superb alternative to the still pricey laptop experience. for casual use, such as web browsing, streaming tv, and basic office productivity, this acer will do just about everything you will need. it also doubles as a cheap, yet powerful linux device. and chrome os will only get better over time, with new apps and software updates for free. why not give it a try? for $250, you won't find a better laptop experience.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than i expected.", "Author": "BReal14", "ReviewID": "R2MPK547XO0I7K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a cheap lounge device watching tv while facebooking and not really doing anything productive.

It takes less than 7 seconds to boot up from sleep or shutdown mode. I have yet to encounter any problems with this deviceBATTERY LIFE:EXCELLENT! This lasts pretty much the whole day. It lasted about 8 hours my first day when I tested it using google docs for my cover letters and streaming video. Very impressed so far with this, takes less than 2 hours to fully charge. Stand-by time is amazing. It was at 91% when I closed the lid with wifi turned on, when I woke up and opened it, it was still at 91%. I assume that the battery will last longer if I turn off the wifi before I put it in sleep mode.BUILD QUALITY AND LOOKS:Yes when closed it looks a little ugly, but when you use a laptop you only see the keyboard and screen. And that is not ugly (in my opinion). It looks fine screen is not the best, but its not as bad as people make it out to be. I can still watch movies and do work on it, so its alright in my book.KEYBOARD/TRACKPAD:Contrary to the \"official\" reviews, the keyboard is actually pretty good to type on. I write my cover letters and word documents on it all day and I haven't had any trouble with it. The Trackpad however is lame. It's small and mine seems a little wobbly (maybe its defective?). But there is a simple solution, wireless or wired mouse. Worked fine when plugged in (just make sure you plug it in to the USB 2.0 port [next to the SD slot]). But if you don't wanna buy one the trackpad although being lame, is not a deal breaker and is still usable.SPEAKERS:Yea, they suck. Boo hoo. I feel like its standard for people to have a sound system or a speaker set anyway, I doubt ANYONE uses stock speakers on any laptop anymore. I always use my headphones anyway, so this is NOT a deal breaker.SUMMARY SO FAR:4.9 only because of the trackpad. Everyone runs smooth, there are ALOT of useful chrome apps that I did not know existed. I haven't used my \"primary\" computer so far after this purchase. Bottom line, if you need a laptop to write documents, surf the web, or do pdfs, this is a great buy. I don't think any other chromebook or laptop under $300 can beat this.

In my laptop, I have no need for anything more than what is in the browser.  One thing I will say is that I am particularly pleased with the design of this laptop.  I expected the design and construction to be pretty horrible in exchange for the speed and battery life and far and away I have been impressed.Comparing it to the HP Chromebook 11 I have to say I don't mind it at all.  For me, it could easily be preference between the design of the two.  The HP has glossy white plastic, but smudges easily.  They both have a quality keyboard/trackpad experience.  The HP charges via MicroUSB but the Acer charges faster.  I thought I would be making a downgrade in design and thoughtful features to have a Chromebook that felt speedy and lasted a long time on a charge (this does both those things extremely well) but instead after taking possession of the unit and actually getting my hands on one it really feels like a side-grade if anything.  The design is businesslike and professional and the speakers are loud and clear to my ear, for casual listening and video sharing.  I really like the fact that it charges quickly.  I would caution against transferring expectations for the build from the old acer chromebook.  The new one is miles better, more sturdy to pick up by a corner, thinner, and overall more solid.  The screen has a nice anti-glare coating on it and is reasonably sharp and bright.  It does not bother me to have a slightly reduced off angle viewing experience, as it is my habit on any device to view the screen at the optimal angle.  I have never understood the complaints about the viewing angles on laptops. When you open your screen to use it, leave it at an optimal angle and this will never be a problem in normal use.In summary, I feel the tradeoffs are well worth it and this is the best Chromebook bar none, save for the Pixel.  The design is usually listed as the major downside to it compared to the HP and I feel this is an overblown judgement.

Even if this is all you ever do with it, the C720 is well worth the price.In addition, you can easily find instructions for installing Ubuntu Linux (search for Crouton and Chromebook). I have no real computer expertise, and I'm not a programmer. I did this in about 30 minutes. I'd recommend this for anyone who likes learning about gadgets and electronics, etc. People who are end users but want little to do with learning about technology shouldn't bother. But if you DO like such things, installing Ubuntu means you can install DropBox (yes, keeping a sync'ed local copy of your documents on the machine), Skype, LibreOffice...

From booting up to word processing on Google Drive, I rarely have stuttering problems. Every now and then it'll hiccup if I'm pushing the number of tasks, but this is to be expected with any device. Videos, especially Amazon Prime Instant streaming have some light frame issues, but the C720 is not meant to be a media machine besides the occasional YouTube video (which look fantastic) and streaming music. The device shines at being a productivity powerhouse on the go.OSChrome OS is great. It meets my needs on the go, and for everything else (Word documents that have comments and Zip files are the only things that send me to my PC) I can go to a library or boot up my other computer. Doing homework on Drive, downloading it to the device and uploading it to a dropbox works just fine. Otherwise, everything that you can do on Chrome, you can do on the C720. Also, getting creative with Chrome apps is half the fun of Chrome OS over a traditional machine.I also installed Chrombuntu on the C720, and, while it runs fine, there are a lot of bugs that hinder its ability to truly shine (i.e. you can't close the lid without having to restart; can't use shortcuts on the keys of the C720).BuildSolid. I cannot understate how full-bodied the C720 feels when picking up from any angle. Closed, it feels like a tablet. Open, I feel no reason to be terribly careful about holding it up by the space beside the trackpad while adjusting my workspace. The device is made of very hard plastic throughout, giving the feel of more solid makeup than many PCs several times its price.PortsWhile I haven't had a situation where I've had to use both USB ports at once, they're reassuring to have. I have transferred data several times via USB thumb drive, and the speed is fine; USB 3.0 isn't that amazing unless you actually have a 3.0 device. Connecting the C720 to my external monitor is a breeze: Chrome OS handles the display with ease, and I don't have much problem with performance dropping. Having more ports gives me a feeling of ease that I don't think I would have had with the HP Chromebook 11.Keyboard/TrackpadKeyboard is very nice. With every new laptop, you have to give yourself time to get use to it. The keys don't depress as far as, say, a MacBook Pro, but they're well-spaced, and flying through a document is just fine. Trackpad isn't great, but it works, and tapping feels smooth. I wish Chrome OS allows double-tapping drag, but maybe we'll get that feature soon.ScreenI've owned an Asus EEE PC that had the same form of matte-finish, so I knew what I was getting into. It's not a pretty screen and not ideal for video watching. I recommend turning the brightness up as much as possible for making viewing easier. Still, I got used to it very quickly and haven't had any problem with productivity because of it.BatteryI have yet to run the C720 out since using it for day-to-day tasks. A day of general browsing and note-taking, I usually end the day at 70% battery. If I've studied hard at the library after classes or watched some Amazon Prime Instant Video, I'm usually down around 40%. I'm thoroughly impressed at the balance of power and longevity.OverallI am nitpicking in many of the categories above; they're really just things to be aware of before you buy.

It doesn't come in any fancy box or shipped with any cool extras (besides the 100gb Google Drive and gogo vouchers), but at this price point you can't expect much more than that. Immediately upon start, the familiar Google login prompts and if you're like me with an array of other Google tech, you'll feel right at home. Now when I say I was up and running fast, I meant FAST. This product does exactly what it was advertised and then some, you can literally shut it close and open, IMMEDIATELY returning to what you had been doing without a hiccup. This is the perfect device in between a laptop and tablet, a bit bigger than a netbook but packs a much stronger punch. I would suggest this to anyone needing a laptop for light browing and general PC usage (students as well), all the applications are there to do what Windows does; the learning curve is barely existant. I have 2 desktop PCs built by myself, a Nexus 7, Nexus 4, iPad 4th gen, and I can already tell this will be my main device from now on!!!!!", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Highly functional and easy to use", "Author": "R.

I have been using it for a week now and like it a lot.  The keyboard is good, but could be better with a full set of navigation arrows and a delete key (alt-bksp works).  The screen is fine, although the HD aspect ratio has its usual problem supporting 8.5x11 pdf documents.  The touchpad works a lot better using gestures than trying to use the bottom edge as mouse buttons.  It comes with cloud-based apps (and 100 GB of cloud storage), but I intend to use Ubuntu for document processing (see [...] I have downloaded a few chrome apps, like CIRC for chat and Kindle reader.  I was really pleased to see that it could use both Windows and Ubuntu partitions on thumb drives.  I also bought the Satechi ST-U3B1N, which is a 3-port USB extender for the USB3 port along with a Gigabit network port.  I just plugged it in and plugged in my wired network and everything just worked.  The 8-1/2 hour advertised battery life appears to be the real deal.

Un-boxed it and installed ubuntu, kde WM via crouton. Between the two operating systems I can do just about everything I need to on this thing. Even with two window managers running side-by-side, I didn't notice any lag on application launching. Does everything as promised, fast internet browsing, netflix streaming, et al.Three complaints, again keeping the price in mind:1. The black on the display is far from \"true black\" which is only mildly annoying in b/c I spend a lot of time in a terminal -- this also results in poor visibility in outdoor, sunny situations.2. The key board has a decent layout (good spacing on the keys) but the keys are really \"soft\", better than a lot of netbooks out there; type-able, but not great.3. The trackpad, at first it didn't track well, but after some use, it is much more responsive (perhaps some manufacturing coating that was left over). My biggest complaint, No right click. You can double-finger click for right click or use the usual shortcut clicks: alt, ctl, and shift. This is irratating, but I am beginning to get used to it.All-in-all, Sweet hardware, solid chassis and hinges (the screen is a little flimsy, but not in too scary a way) could use better I/O devices, but they had to skimp somewhere -- for $250, this device has great value. Battery life was as advertised (8.5). Ran all day, two desktops under moderate use, over seven hours. I am excited to be able to leave my charger at home:-) Wake up out of sleep is instantaneous, and boot from power off was about 5sec (advertised as 7sec).Final recommendation: If you already use much of the google mail, doc, calendar, etc stuff, this device is worth looking into.  This device will do everything most people do on the internet; however, google does not support skype -- you will not find it in your google store/apps.I uploaded a picture of the innards for those curious about what is inside, and up-gradable.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "I think we've found the Samsung killer", "Author": "jda5id \"jda5id\"", "ReviewID": "R2BIZSITUOH1FJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think many folks would agree that for the past year the Samsung has been the state of the art when it comes to Chromebooks.  I own two of them and both my wife and I have been quite happy using them.  For her, it represents a primary machine where she is able to do 99% of what she ever needs with a computer, e.g., email, Facebook, Pinterest, etc.  For me, it has been a great secondary machine which I use primarily for writing when I am away from my office.As much as I have liked my Samsung Chromebook, it has always felt like it was just 95% of the way there.  My issue has always been that the performance was a little slower than it should be.  Rather than smoothly navigating between windows and around the web, it always felt like it was lagging a second behind my performance expectations.  My wife doesn't notice and doesn't mind because it is all she ever uses and it feels perfectly fine for her.  For me, however, after spending 10 hours a day working on a fantastic Macbook Pro I can distinctly feel the difference when I downshift to my Samsung at home at night.  It was good enough for my use cases that I didn't mind enough to pursue my most likely alternative (buy a Macbook air), but it rankled nonetheless.Well, I am happy to report that the architecture improvements with the C720 have absolutely removed all of those concerns.  I've been using my new C720 extensively since it arrived a couple days ago and I am happy to report that in my mind it is an absolutely perfect machine for what I use it for.  It navigates the web with aplomb with the same snappy performance as my MacBook.  The Google Docs apps are absolutely perfect for my needs when I am away from my office.  My company uses Office 365 so I can even use the web versions of the MS Office Suite in those rare circumstances where I can't meet my needs with Google Docs.Side-by-side with the Samsung I find the machines to be more similar than not.  The design of the Samsung is marginally more sleek and attractive, but we aren't comparing a sports car to an 18-wheeler here.  The design of the Acer is just fine, at least to my eyes.  As for usage, I actually prefer the keyboard and trackpad on the Acer to the Samsung, though both of those are clearly features that are highly subjective in terms of how people experience them.  I read some reviews that complained about the build quality of the Acer, but I will say that I actually find it to feel much more \"solid\" than the Samsung which was always just a smidgen too \"plasticky\" for me.If you have a Samsung and think it is a perfect machine then I would not bother buying a C720.  I am not planning to replace my wife's, though I am guessing that might change if she ever gets the chance to use my C720 and actually notices the difference.  If you have a Samsung and it has always felt just a little bit slow, then by all means grab one of these as soon as they are in stock.  It is a near perfect machine for word processing, simple spreadsheets and web surfing.  I cannot in a million years imagine spending a grand for a Macbook Air when I can have this guy for 20 to 25% of that price.  I make that comparison because that was the choice I was making to solve my particular problem...I want a great machine that I can use when I am away from my desk and need to write or surf the web.  I would have kept using the Samsung in that scenario by just eating the aggravation I felt over its performance, but it would have always bugged me.  The C720, on the other hand, is the perfect Chromebook and actually a perfect computer as long as your use cases match its vast capabilities.

Having many tabs open at once, watching video online, or being on image heavy websites would typically bring an older Chromebook to its knees. Now, with this Haswell powered 4 GB device, this thing runs pretty buttery smooth with many tabs open and/or running videos. I also love the fact that I can use an HDMI cable to hook up the Chromebook to my TV to stream pretty much anything I want (serving the function of a Roku or Apple TV).

Review", "ReviewID": "RKEUYL5TL40ZL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Many people criticize the C720 for looking simple and plain, but I quite like the way it looks.  It is very professional and clean looking, unlike the HP chromebooks which in my opinion look like a cheap toy.  The screen on this is pretty standard - it's not an IPS display, although it does get pretty bright which is a good thing.  The keyboard and trackpad are also average for a thin laptop.  They are responsive enough to get the job done, but are obviously not top of the line.  The trackpad feels a little loose at times, like it's not set in place for some reason.  Nonetheless, I have used much more expensive laptops with worse keyboards and trackpads.  Overall build quality feels solid for a mostly plastic device.  The hinge is sturdy and the whole construction feels much better than other devices in this price range.Now on to the fun stuff...I have been thinking about buying a chromebook for a long time now, but sub-par specs and ARM processors really turned me off.  Then came along the 720, and from a specifications point of view, gets pretty much everything just right.  I am extremely pleased with what $249 can buy in terms of hardware these days.  4 gigs is more than enough to handle nearly all tasks that you can hope to do in chrome os.  You can open tabs to your heart's content and stream HD videos without any hiccups.  This is also thanks to the Haswell processor which performs phenomenally.  Not to mention the battery life which is dramatically improved over previous generations.  The 8.5 hours on the box is closer to the actual life than you might think.I bought this laptop mainly to use with crouton.  I have already installed Xubuntu 12.04 and it is lightning fast.  Everything worked out of the box too, except for the touchpad sensitivity which was easily fixed with a couple of commands.  Libre office writer loads in under 2 seconds.  Java JDK installed perfectly.  I can easily do office work and light programming on this laptop.  At idle, the task manager in Xubuntu reports that less than 600 MB of ram is in use - and that accounts for the entire system, not just the xubuntu chroot.I am overjoyed with the c720 so far and am looking forward to what else I can manage to do with it.

The idea of the Chromebook has intrigued me for awhile.  A light, portable laptop that is great for travel, with files being stored in the cloud.  The idea is to have a system that can easily be wiped when entering a foreign country, and when returning to the US, with important files being copied / moved to the cloud in between.This computer fits the bill in a couple different ways.  You could buy in to all of Google's ecosystem, and use it as-is.  Or, you can enable \"developer mode\", which lets you run a number of different Debian or Ubuntu Linux versions in \"chrooted jails\".  This means that they are not virtualized, but running at full speed right next to ChromeOS, switchable with a simple key combination.  This lets you use all of the Linux software you are used to, with a nifty script called \"crouton\".  With it, you can easily save off jails that you have configured with the software you want to use, put them in the cloud, download them when you need them, then destroy them when you are done and need to \"wipe\" the system.Besides the \"traveler\" use case, this computer is great for grabbing when you need to jump on the net in seconds.  Chrome is an excellent browser, and you can be up an on it in seven seconds from cold boot.  My desktop systems, which have fully encrypted hard drives, take minutes to boot up.Using ChromeOS is dead simple.  It is also probably the most secure consumer computer OS out there right now: [...] .  It is a great computer for users with simple needs as well.Pros: The build quality is decent for $250.  It also looks nice (though maybe not as nice as the HP 11).  My boss walked past my desk and called it \"sexy\".  It is very light, and easy to throw into a bag to take anywhere.  The battery life has been great.. around 8.5 hours per day so far.  The screen is completely passable for the price.  The performance is fantastic!  It doesn't miss a beat with multiple tabs open, and even running Ubuntu at the same time in a jail.  Lots of ports.  And with the 100 GB of Google Drive for two years (which will take the place of another online backup system I'm using at $10 a month, it pays for itself!), 12 GoGo in-flight coupons, and the two months of Google Music (which is great!  finding lots of older music I used to listen to), it really feels like a no-brainer for me.  Netflix works great, and the camera works great in Google Hangouts.Cons: I only have a couple of gripes: The keyboard is a little small for my fat fingers, and the keys are lower than I'm used to. The other thing is that when running Google Music and Ubuntu at the same time, the sound can stutter when I'm in Linux, but it pops back in when I switch back over.  Most people will never see this.Other thoughts: If you are tied to software that only runs on Microsoft Windows, then the Chromebook isn't for you, unless you want a great, cheap little computer for the quick searches, email, and a game or two (kind of like a \"super tablet\" rather than a \"laptop minus\").", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Takes care of all my computer needs!", "Author": "\u0134\u0134", "ReviewID": "R11ED86QQA21S5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly, I'd never really looked into what a Chromebook exactly was before getting this product.  With my current laptop's battery completely useless, I was planning on buying a new $500 HP laptop.  When I got the opportunity to try out this much cheaper, seemingly less efficient Chromebook, I decided to put my laptop shopping on hold, and I am so glad I did!  Although it may seem like the price is too good to be true, you can literally do most things on this $200 Chromebook that you could do on any other laptop, and you might even be able to do them better and quicker!The first thing I noticed about this Chromebook is the amazing speed it has; it literally powers on and off in a matter of 10 seconds or less.  Since it doesn't have an operating system like Windows, it doesn't have to constantly be applying updates, which was one of my major frustrations with owning a Windows computer.  It also browses the internet with lightning fast speed on a connection that took much longer on my old computer.The battery life is another amazement of this Chromebook.  It boasts an 8.5 hour battery life, but I've often seen it lasting 11 hours or more.  Charging it takes an hour or two at most, and it will always tell you at the bottom right of the screen how much percentage remains and how much longer you have before the computer shuts off.Bluetooth is an option on the Chromebook, but I haven't yet used it and cannot comment further on it.Everything is set up to use Google Chrome and its respective apps, hence calling this a Chromebook.  I'm not sure if you can change Chrome as your internet browser, but I haven't found a reason to do so yet.  Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, and Google Play Music are all available as icons on your desktop to be used a moment's notice.  There are also various other Google apps preloaded onto the Chromebook such as Google Maps and Gmail.  In fact, your Gmail name is how you will sign into your computer every day; you even use you Gmail password to log in.  This definitely forces you to get Gmail if you don't have it already, but you aren't forced to necessarily use it.  This might be a hindrance to those who don't use Google or Gmail on a regular basis, but I personally think it's worth it.The size of the Chromebook is definitely small, but I had been already using a small laptop of the same size, so it wasn't much of an adjustment for me.  If you're used to using a bigger laptop, it might be a bit awkward to shrink down to this size, but it works fine and is easy to see.  The keyboard seems to be high quality and responsive to touch.  There's no Caps Lock button, which I thought was odd; it's instead been replaced with a search key that will prompt a Google search when hit.  Everything else seems to be there.The touchpad responds well for me.  It doesn't have a right click option much like the Macbook, so to copy and paste things, you must highlight it then go to menu at the top of your screen and select either copy or paste.  This is somewhat lengthier than what I'm used to on my old laptop but definitely not a negative.  EDIT - I was corrected about this by a very helpful commenter BKarno who says, \"Tap or click on the touchpad with 2 fingers for right click, and consult the help for other available touchpad gestures.\"There is a webcam installed into this Chromebook, and from my limited usage of it, the quality seems to be very nice and definitely much nicer than my previous webcams, external or otherwise.  I'm impressed, although I haven't used it much at all.You can download small items onto this Chromebook such as pictures and word files, but I'm not sure about large files such as games and videos.  I haven't tried it since this Chromebook is definitely oriented towards internet access and Google app usage.  I do definitely recommend going with another laptop option if you plan to use it for hardcore gaming, video downloading, or even video editing.Overall, I'm VERY pleased with this laptop; it meets my needs perfectly.  I'm able to browse the internet faster than ever before, yet I am still able to type through Google Docs, different as it may be from Microsoft Word.

Hite", "ReviewID": "R1K96N1M5YCOJW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bottom line: If power and battery life are important to you in a Chromebook, this is definitely gives you the biggest, longest bang for your buck.First - as other reviewers have said, you need to understand what a Chromebook is and what it isn't, and understand what your actual needs are. You should probably disregard any poor reviews that focus on Chrome OS. Chrome OS is built entirely around the browser, so if the majority of what you need to do is also centered around the browser then you should be very satisfied. You may still need a \"main\" computer, because it isn't going to run Quicken or the latest Call of Duty.I looked at several models (most notably from Samsung and HP) before opting for the Acer. I was very skeptical about Acer, having first-hand experience with managing their products and selling them, but they've done an excellent job here. Be very careful when looking at reviews for the C7-series ... a lot of them are of the older C710, which is inferior to the C720 in almost every respect.I bought this for my wife, who probably would have been satisfied with the 2GB model. I opted for the 4GB because they had one refurbished for $189. I've been stealing it and using it around the house and I absolutely love it. It is our first Chromebook, but I also have about a dozen other devices - A work-horse Dell Latitude E-series laptop with Windows 8.1, two gaming desktop rigs, a Surface Pro tablet, Kindle Fire, etc. I find myself using this Acer for my evening activities 90% of the time when I get home from work.There were a few things on my wishlist for a Chromebook and this thing hits them all:Performance/Speed:This laptop is extremely snappy for a Chromebook - no amount of tabs or videos I opened seemed to cause it to slow down. You could talk all day about the hardware, but the bottom line is that I never find myself waiting for it do anything, minus the 7 seconds (!) it takes to boot.Screen:Nothing to write home about and it isn't as bright as some other units, but I found it to be more than adequate for where we used it most often - inside the house. I'm not taking a laptop out to the beach personally. I really liked the matte finish, which makes much more sense to me than a glossy screen to reduce glare and reflection. This isn't a super-high pixel density screen, but it is still above average and for the money you can't do much better at 11.6\". I find that I don't miss my Surface Pro screen at all (which has a much higher resolution, PPI, and a smaller screen).Battery:Amazing. 8.5 hours is not an exaggeration, depending on how you use it. We rarely have to think about charging it - and when we do, it charges very quickly. It has the best battery life of all of our devices (minus our Kindle) and I can always count on it to be charged and usable. The Haswell micro-architecture in the processor goes a long ways towards providing excellent performance without producing too much heat or burning the battery down.Mouse/Keyboard:Both excellent. My wife loves the touch pad (an input device she normally hates) and click-anywhere functionality. You'll be hard-pressed to find a fault with the keyboard, which is very usable and comfortable. It has great feedback and I had no problem getting up to 100% of my normal WPM rate on this thing. The touch pad click is pretty dang loud, but tapping is just as easy and appropriate in most situations. It isn't quite as responsive as something in the vein of a MacBook Air, but once again - this is a $250 machine.Comfort/Weight:There are lighter 10-12\" machines out there, but you'd be crazy to call this thing heavy at just under 3 lbs. It is only marginally heavier than an 11\" MacBook Air. It does have a fan, though it hardly puts out any heat. The fan does generate a small amount of background noise. I personally don't notice it unless the room is dead quiet.Input/Output:The USB 3.0 and an SD card reader mean we don't need another device to take on the road and connect to our camera to upload photos. HDMI output is a great addition, though if you find yourself often connecting to your TV I would recommend getting the $35 Chromecast, which makes the experience cable-free and much smoother.Aesthetics:It isn't as sexy as some other units, but I don't find it to be particularly ugly either as some have suggested. It is attractive enough that you won't feel embarrassed pulling it out of your bag in a crowded airport terminal - just don't expect to garner any device-envy from those nearby.All-in-all, we are very happy with the purchase - nice work Acer!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Choice For Me", "Author": "Kate B. \"The Book Monsters\"", "ReviewID": "ROJ2EYRDM7A0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A few months ago, my old netbook died. Since then, I have been debating on what to do for a replacement. I had temporarily been using the Asus Transformer with attached keyboard, but to honest, I really hated that thing. Oh, it was great for surfing the web and a few others things, but at the end of the day, it is just a tablet with a keyboard. I needed more. I needed a full browser, not just a mobile browser that can sometimes request desktop site, and while the battery life was amazing, it never truly felt like it could be considered replacement for a netbook.The debate was on. What did I truly need for in my netbook? Sure, all the bells and whistles can be great, but I really didn't want to pay $400+ for a replacement. However, with netbook production now on the decline, if not extinct, my options were pretty slim in regards to finding something that was pretty close to what I had, or giving in and going the whole laptop route. I really did not want to go with a laptop due to both price and not really needing all the options they come with.Enter the Chromebook.Even before my netbook had died, I had been keeping an eye on the Chromebooks. The idea of them appealed to me, but I just wasn't 100% sold on how it worked. However, now that I was in the market for a replacement, the Chromebook was again on my radar, and ultimately my final choice after comparing dozens of options.My experience after a few weeks of use has made me even more certain Chromebook was the best choice for me.Design:While this isn't the prettiest Chromebook out there, the design is well done. The external has a nice solid feel to it. There are no messy finger prints being left behind (around the screen does sometimes). The screen is beautiful. Just the right size and the colors look great. The keyboard is responsive and laid out nicely. I do wish there was a delete button, instead of just the backspace, but it isn't a deal breaker. I am still on the fence about the touchpad. However, I personally use a mouse attached to the usb whenever I can, so again, not a deal breaker.Battery Life:Acer C720 states that it averages about 8.5 hours. While I have never timed it to check, I would swear mine gets even more than that. I can have it turned off for days and when I turn it on again, have tons of battery life left. Using it only with the browser seems to barely use any battery.Memory:The Acer C720 comes with 16gb of SSD. In the beginning, this was one of my concerns about the Chromebook. Would I need more? How quickly will that 16gb get filled? After about a month, the concerns over 16gb really are not there anymore. It does have a SD card reader so if I need more storage, I can always use that. Plus, there is always Google Drive Cloud as an option.Other Thoughts:For me, the Chromebook is perfect. I love the easy of use. Everything being at my fingertips without having to get on a regular PC. I am also a heavy Google user, so all my documents are easily available through Drive. After about a month of use, I really do not have any negatives for this Chromebook. It is super quiet, maybe will hear a fan every now and then. Never gets hot after hours of use.Bottom line, for those needing a second computer option, students, bloggers, and many more, this is a fantastic option.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "[4.5 Stars] A Dirt-attracting Prodigy", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Fred\"", "ReviewID": "R1JX07WP9OMBPA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The first thing you're going to notice about this is how light and small it is. The next thing you'll notice about it is how exponentially-better-than-anything-you-have fast it is on boot up. They boast it has a 7-second boot time. Lie. Mine boots up faster than that.The one thing I do not want you to notice is that you ought not to compare this with a PC (or to be inclusive I suppose, a Mac). It's not. Any attempt to compare will result in the Chromebook coming out behind. If you're a hardcore PC user, there is a usability curve you will have to climb because things aren't where you're used to! The keyboard is missing a ton of keys that you take for granted (Home, PageUp, PageDown, End among others) and for which you will need to learn a few keyboard combination strokes. This being a Google product, you will not be lacking in finding help if you need it, just search.So essentially, the OS is one rather large and beefy web browser. There exist \"apps\" that you can download and \"install\" from the Chrome store but many of them are simply shortcuts to those apps' websites. Speaking of the Chrome app store, there's a ton of them so chances are very good that you will find whatever you're looking for. I only had a problem with one of them, Snagit, which didn't work as advertised. Everything else I've tried has worked well--try the Webcam Toy which uses the built-in camera in all sorts of different ways. The camera itself is just good, nothing spectacular but what is one to expect of a $250 machine I guess.The keyboard is pleasantly laid out (apart from the missing keys) and it's easy to type on it but not for too long; I found my fingers getting cramped by minute 30 but I think that's because it's minute 30 and not because the keyboard is out to get me. It's just so small that you will find yourself hunching over whether you like it or not, unless you're 3' 2\".Because it's Chrome, it is fast in rendering most pages. Actually, let me say that I have not yet found a page it doesn't handle well. And because it's Google, if you use Chrome anywhere else, you can synchronize any and everything and that's very cool. For example, changing the theme on the browser on the Chromebook will almost instantly make the same theme change on the Chrome browser on your PC. Installing a browser extension will synchronize that installation across all your Chrome browsers. I am also able to get to my tab histories on my PC, on the Chromebook, and on Chrome running on my Android phone! I'm not one of those who's freaked out by the reach of Google into my life so I enjoy this feature very much.I don't use Microsoft Office very much, the occasional Word document is about it. Once in a while, I'll go crazy and fire up Excel and for presentations, PowerPoint. I have been using Google Docs (is it still called this, I wonder) for a long time and in fact, I'm typing this up in Document right now. I have not used the other products in the Docs suite, Presentation or Spreadsheets, but that's because I don't really need to. I'll have to give them a go to see if how useful they are.I have access to all the features I've come to depend on, including dynamic spell-checking & correction and constant saves to Google Drive. There was once I was typing a rather long document while using a dodgy wireless point and it would spazz out on saving the document to Drive, locking the document in the process until it had regained connectivity to Drive. That was annoying to no end. It is possible to use the offline versions of the Google Docs and I've found that works well.  Since just about everywhere you go these days will have wireless, this isn't as much of a problem as it used to be although I do wish it had a physical Ethernet connection. The touchpad is mega-responsive, in fact too much sometimes. When typing out a long document I defy you to avoid accidentally sending the mouse careening off the screen as a wayward thumb bumps on the touchpad.Connectivity is not limited to wireless. It's got Bluetooth, two USB ports--one 3.0--and an HDMI output. USB mice work instantly and well as do any drives you connect. There is also an SD card port as well with a headset output for sound and microphone. The sound is crisp and graphics are clear and distinct which is surprising for such a small form factor. Printing is done through the Google cloud printer and I never had a problem with set up and use. In fact, it's downright easy--if you have a Chrome browser anywhere that's connected to a printer, you can send print jobs rather easily.The one drawback to this Acer is how much it attracts dust and dirt. It is simply impossible to keep this thing clean.Apart from having to learn to get comfortable in an entirely different environment, finding apps that you can use, the Chromebook is a delight to use. Just don't compare it to your desktop. 4.5 stars.After I hit \"send\" I just remembered one massive up: the battery life on this thing is insane.

I can no longer stand to sit there and wait for my Windows 7 Gateway to come out of hibernation mode; I get too impatient.The Acer boasts a 8 second startup time, but I would challenge that. It's more like 5-6 seconds.So, once you're started up you absolutely, positively must be connected to the internet. Chromebooks will not operate without the internet. If you have no internet, move along, nothing to see here.Now, in the beginning it connected seamlessly to my WiFi, then went thru one update, then the WiFi suffered tremendously. It was constantly dropping connection on a MediaLink wireless router (read those reviews, those things don't drop connection). After submitting a complaint to Acer and dropping the Vine card there was an update the next day for the Chromebook which immediately fixed the connection issue. I've not dropped connection since.The Chrome browser imports all of my settings including bookmarks, passwords, etc. from my other Chrome browser on my Windows laptop which saves me so much time from starting from scratch, again.There are no function keys on the Chromebook, like you find in windows. No F1, F2, F3, etc., but you do have Escape, Back, Forward, Refresh, Full Screen, Swap Windows (Alt+Tab for you Windows folks), Dim Brightness, Brighten Brightness, Mute, Volume Down, Volume Up and Power. There is also no 10-key or delete key. It is also a single button mouse, which means you need to use it like a Mac. Ctrl+Click to open in new tab, Alt+Click to right click. Ah! Can't forget about the lack of a CAPS LOCK key. That's probably the one I forget most often. Instead it's a search key.It does have the capability of saving photos to the hard drive for quick retrieval later. I haven't tried saving any documents to the hard drive because I haven't needed to.When you close the lid to the CB it sleeps immediately. When you open it it wakes immediately (I mean IMMEDIATELY, not even 1 second delay).There's a number of Chrome apps you can use, but the lack of Skype is the only thing that has kept me using my laptop from time to time.Also, don't plan on using a real mouse with the CB. Although I have mine set up to the fastest speed it still crawls across the screen. That's probably my biggest complaint.I recommended this computer to two people who only wanted something cheap and could give them access to the internet because they're chronic Facebook users. They both went out and bought it and both have enjoyed it ever since.I love that the battery on this thing REALLY lasts for 9+ hours with the brightness set to it a middle setting and lots and lots of Candy Crush.If I want to take it to work I simply throw it in my purse and off I go. Because it's able to hold a charge so long I have NEVER had to worry about bringing a charging cable with me.If this is the future of internet-only laptops, then the C720 is the standard by which all CB's should be measured. It's a fabulous tool that I recommend to everyone everywhere. It's so budget friendly and does the one thing it promises to do, plus a teensy bit more.Well done, Acer and Google!

For a price comparable to a smartphone, consumers receive a dual core Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 16 GB solid state drive.  Sure, the Celeron processor might not be able to run Call of Duty at 60 fps, but it's more than capable of running a few internet browser windows and Google Docs.Connectivity ports include include 1 x 2.0 and 1 x 3.0 USB ports, an SD-cart slot, and dual WiFi band/Bluetooth connectivity.  Missing is an Ethernet port, which I think they should've included for \"legacy\" users.  My wireless router recently broke and I was unable to conveniently use the Chromebook without going to a coffee shop.  Had an Ethernet port been included, I would still have had Internet access.Despite the price, the C720 felt very solid and well-assembled to the touch.  Unfortunately, the cover was not fingerprint resistant and attracted my greasy paw prints.  The chiclet style keyboard and touchpad were standard fare, though typing/stroke action felt plasticky and cheap.  Although the SSD is only 16 GB, one could easily expand its off storage capacity using a USB drive.  The display seemed a little washed out, but for $249 I'm not going to give it much grief.  It was perfectly suitable for reading email and documents.  The C720 was very silent during usage.  Lastly, battery life was pretty miserly, providing nearly a week of standby power and ~ 8-9 hours in continuous usage over the course of a day.As for Chrome OS, I think it has potential but it's not quite there yet for me.  While most people might be happy with basic document editing and internet connectivity, that's not enough capability for me.  For instance, the inability to create a new document (combined with the lack of a physical Ethernet port) unless connected to the Internet was a dealbreaker for me.Ultimately, I see the C720 not as a secondary laptop, but more like a tertiary laptop replacement, limited by the availability of WiFi networks.

Yes, it does take some practice but it comes easier with more practice.  No different than learning a two-button mouse from those who transferred from the Apple single-button mouse.Overall - performance is great.  Battery is awesome.  Keyboard feels delightful.

My first PC was an Acer and it was a real disappointment.  I had such a bad experience that I've stayed away from them for something like a decade now.  When I got the chance to give one of these a try, I was a little skeptical, but decided to give them a fair shake.  So how did it do?  Short version, I may be rethinking my Acer stance.First thing to know is this IS NOT a Windows PC nor a Mac.  Do not buy it thinking it is or you'll only be disappointed.  If you aren't familiar with what a Chromebook is, picture a computer that is (almost) entirely a web browser.  I mean that in the literal sense.  You do have the ability to add apps something like a tablet would, but actual Android apps will not run on it.  Essentially it's not so much a traditional laptop as a well powered tablet with a keyboard.  A big word of warning, if you play Java based games (e.g. Runescape or Minecraft) you're out of luck; there's no support*.  I'll go into a little more detail on it, but below is the nickel tour.What I Liked-Blazing fast boot time-Great battery life lasts many hours-Smallish hard drive still fits enough-Quiet, with a fan that doesn't make much noise-Solid state hard drive won't risk damage if it's bounced around a little while running-Handles Korean characters and Chrome prompts to translate Korean sites to English-Extremely secure by default even without an AntiVirus program-Small and very portable-Played videos I gave it easilyWhat I Disliked-Keyboard feels slightly cheap-Power adapter connection is thin and seems it could bend easily and be ruined-Power brick is at a slightly inconvenient length in the middle of the cord-Keyboard is missing some common keys you're used to-No Java supportOut of the box, I just turned it on, found a network, signed in as a guest, and was up and running on the Internet in a couple minutes.  The OS checks for updates for you, so for better or worse you just get notifications it's updating and no choice about whether you want to update now, later, or not at all.  If you've used Chrome on your PC/Mac, then you pretty much know what to expect.  Other than the keyboard layout being a little funky, with a \"search\" button where the Caps Lock should be, I didn't have much problem navigating.  However, the touchpad is going to take some getting used to.  You can use one finger to move the mouse and click, but it takes using two fingers to scroll.  I had no idea going in, but figured it out on my own.  You can alternatively plug a USB mouse into one of the two USB ports and use that to control it.I'd have to say it's extremely user friendly and something you could probably give to a tech illiterate family member to still do the basic social media site stuff and email with decreased risk they're going to do something that compromises their personal data.  Sure they could still answer that Nigerian email about the long lost cousin who left them a million dollars if they only pay the $10K of taxes up front, but they're not going to be able to install a wacky video codec that's actually a Trojan horse by a hacker living in Russia.  If you can teach someone how to use a browser, then you can teach them how to use a Chromebook.  If anything, this is going up against tablets for your dollars and it's hard to say, but it might be even a bit simpler to use than a tablet, though possibly a bit more limiting in some ways too.I almost wanted to find major faults since I've been anti-Acer for so many years, but I have to hand it to them this thing looks pretty sold and it is not only fast, but pleasant to use.  If it dies quickly or something, rest assured I'll update my review, but so far it's not giving me any cause to suspect an early demise.  The only caution I'd give you is to be absolutely sure you don't want something low-end with Windows on it like a Netbook.  You can most likely find programs that will meet some of your needs, but if you have a website that uses a custom download program, or you need to use a specific password manager or something, then don't get this because you'll just be returning it.  If you just need a handy device for when you want to update Facebook while sitting on the couch or in a coffee shop and you hate playing hunt and peck on a tablet touchscreen, then this is a danged fine piece of tech and a good value for the price.  Definitely not recommended as your primary computer though.*There is a caveat about Chromebooks that may make this device even more useful for you.  You can enter developer mode by pressing Esc+Refresh+Power.  At the warning screens Ctrl+D will get you past them and into Developer mode.  You will lose all saved data though.  There are a couple of packages out there, one being Crouton, which can install a \"real\" Linux environment and allow you to do things like Java or run Wine (runs Windows software on Linux).  However, looking into it a little I'd say you probably shouldn't expect to get it going without a fair bit of work.  Linux is pretty good if what you need is right out of the box, but if you need to configure anything and have never used it before, you could be very lost and frustrated very quickly.  Look at it more as a possible bonus rather than a reason to buy.A warning, if you \"break\" it to install Linux then you're on your own.  I don't know if Acer's warranty is voided or anything, but they certainly wouldn't help you with techsupport.  A bigger concern is that you're bypassing the security so software you install could theoretically steal your info or do something else bad.

Microsoft are the folks who dismissed smartphones and this whole Internet thing as some sort of fad, so take their disparagement with a grain of salt.I used this Chromebook exclusively for two weeks. After installing tools such as a VNC and RDP viewer, SSH terminal, some editors, and a few games, it displaced my laptop completely for several reasons. First, the form factor is much more convenient that a traditional laptop. There's no comparable laptop in similar form factor that doesn't cost three times as much. Battery life is also very good and lasts a good six hours of constant use before the battery indicator turned red.The learning curve was buying into this cloud approach. I.e., most everything is stored in the cloud on Google Drive or Box or Skydrive. Instead of installing Microsoft Office locally, I used the free online Office suite, or Google Docs, depending on what was needed.There's an upside to this, though. A month ago I bought a refurbished Chromebook for $99. Upgrading to this new Acer was as simple as logging in. All my previous preferences, applications, files, etc. all just appeared on the new system. In fact, my family can login to whichever device they want and their environment follows them.I'm quite pleased with the purchase. It's not for everyone but as a fairly technical user (I re-compile Linux kernels in my spare time) and the technical support for a non-techy family, it's an almost perfect device.", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast and fun Chromebook", "Author": "J. Harley", "ReviewID": "RN683UAJM8NSP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Chromebook and I have to say I like it, even though I honestly wasn't sure if I would.  The concept of no traditional OS and everything being entirely web based through Chrome didn't initially appeal to me. Although I own Android and iOS devices which also require accounts, the apps themselves still feel independent from the OS, whereas everything on a Chromebook runs through the Chrome browser. Everything from word processing to changing the background wallpaper or screen resolution is performed in the Chrome browser. Files aren't stored on the internal SSD, they are stored in the Cloud on your 100GB included Google Drive.Performance for this particular Acer C720 is very good.  The lightweight OS, SSD, Haswell architecture and 4GB of RAM make it feel very snappy and much more like a regular laptop rather than the sluggish netbooks of the past. It boots and shuts down in mere seconds and automatically powers on when the lid is lifted.  The OS updates after every boot. The browser responds very quickly to tasks, whether it's using Google docs, watching YouTube videos or simply browsing the web.  Everything moves along briskly without many of the issues that can plague traditional computers.  That does not mean it's completely immune to slowdown.  I encountered a little choppiness at times, particularly when playing Flash based games or multitasking with several Chrome tabs open at once.  Both wi-fi and Bluetooth work perfectly so far.  I get reliable fast wifi performance and my Bluetooth mouse connected quickly and easily.  The speakers are also loud and clear for such a tiny notebook. Battery life averaged about 3-4 hours of nonstop use after a full charge. Viruses and malware are a thing of the past, although web security such as phishing protection, is built into the OS.One thing worth mentioning is that Chromebooks don't run programs or apps.  Although they're called \"apps\", they're more like glorified Chrome extensions installed from the Chrome Store.  If you want to see what I mean, you can install the Chrome browser, visit the Chrome store, and actually install the apps/extensions from any PC or Mac if you want to preview the content that would be available to your Chromebook.  This gives you a try before you buy capability that neither OSX nor Windows 8 offers.  The vast majority of extensions require active Internet access and look, feel, and pretty much are simply flash content on web sites, especially the games.  For instance, after installing the Bejewled \"app\" into Chrome, it was still the same ad-filled Flash game in a tiny box on Popcap's site and run in a Chrome browser window.  In other words, my \"app\" felt like nothing more than a URL shortcut to the online Flash game.  Now, granted, with an entirely web based OS, of course app shortcuts will be URLs, but I expected more of a custom Chromebook optimized page, similar to how MSN is completely different in Windows 8 from any other Windows version, even on a PC in desktop mode.  Google is apparently working to make content available offline. There are a couple dozen apps, including Angry Birds, that can be installed and accessed offline.  They can be found in a section labeled \"For your desktop\".  These apps still require the Chrome browser.  Another major difference is printing.  For whatever reason, they went solely with Google Cloud print.  That means you must set up your cloud-print enabled (if you're lucky enough to have one from the very short list of cloud-print enabled printers) or \"classic\" printer as a web based print server.  It's not overly complicated but still a hassle, especially when you consider that you can simply print directly over a wifi network from an Android device to most printers. Just seems like they made Chromebook printing overly complicated so they can keep ALL your data flowing through Google, even simple print jobs.The Chromebook experience boils down to compromise.  To use and enjoy a Chromebook, you must be willing to accept having extremely limited control over hardware, an unconventional keyboard (for a laptop, although it is thankfully QWERTY).  However, the biggest compromise of all is the willingness to allow everything to run through the Google Chrome browser which is tied to your Google account and means every keystroke goes through Google's servers.  If you have privacy concerns, that may take some serious consideration, especially if this will be your primary PC. But just keep in mind, this is not unique to Google.  Microsoft also began moving in that direction with Windows 8 and Office 2013 by forcing you to log into both with a Microsoft account and not-so-subtly nudging your content into their SkyDrive.  Windows 8 also tries mightily to integrate with everything from Facebook to other online accounts like Google and Yahoo.Despite the impressive performance, there are a few negatives with this Acer.  The screen is too dim for my liking and the color temperature is too cool, almost bluish. Neither the brightness nor color temperature can be adjusted on a Chromebook, so I'm stuck with the screen as-is. I can't blame this entirely on Acer because none of the Chromebooks allow native built-in screen adjustments. The keyboard is also unconventional and is feels more like one of those Bluetooth keyboards used with tablets rather than a PC keyboard.  There is no delete key.  It may not seem like that big a deal for some, but it was a real pain when typing until I found out about using alt-backspace to delete.Regardless of my minor quibbles, this Acer is still a pretty fast and fun Chromebook. I literally could not put it down the first day despite having a retina MacBook and several other nice high-end computers at my disposal.  It fills that void when I want a the instant gratification of a tablet but also the experience and feel that only a real computer can deliver, like real web pages instead of tablet optimized.  If you want an affordable snappy little performer that won't give you the agonizingly slow performance of yesteryear's netbooks, it is the perfect choice.  That's if you are okay with everything running through the cloud and your Google account.  Sure, you could always create a generic account, but based on the way Chromebooks are designed to function, that would make this little more than a glorified web browser and a waste of money.  One major advantage of being tied to your Google account is the integrated email, calendar, office applications and other personalized features.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "This might be the best laptop ever created.

It is funny that three small children will crowd around a small computer to watch a movie or YouTube video. I find the sound tinny and harsh but the children do not mind.The biggest difference between a laptop and a Chromebook, for me, is that the Chromebook is a passive rather than an active device.

I have generally been resistant to using my Google account for anything important. I access information from my clouds, rather than saving it to my Google account and then accessing it just by logging in and using Google chrome and its absolute violation of my privacy. We know that Google wants to know everything about us and admittedly, I probably can't hide much.

Of course, the Chromebook principle is that you have to be connected to the internet is true here with Google Docs.The Chrome store has lots of games and apps too, although the C720 only has a 16GB SD so space is limited.  It does support a full size SD slot for add-on storage though.  Other slots on the unit are 1 x USB 2.0, 1 x USB 3.0, 1 x HDMI out, headphones, and a Kensington lock.The 11.6\" matte finish screen seems to be the sweet spot in terms of size for browsing and for a comfortable workspace. The C720 screen runs native at 1366x768 resolution, but is capable of 1536x864 (and of course lower resolutions too).  As mentioned, this model does not have a touchscreen, but the mouse pad is very responsive--one of the best I've tried.The Chrome OS could use some work still.  For example, I use a complex 15-digit generated password to protect my Gmail account, and since signing into your Google account is required to use a Chromebook, I have to always look it up.  Google needs to take a page from Windows 8's book and allow the use of a local 4-digit pin.I really have nothing bad to say about the Acer C720, with the possible exception that a touchscreen would have made it better.

My only hardware complaint is that the SD card does not go all the way into the machine, Every other device that I've seen, the SD card will fit 100%ly inside the devise. This would hve effectively give the c720 a way to expand storage to 74gig with an sd card. The problem is that if the card is left in, it will break off. I'm going to use a real small USB flash drive to expand storage. The missing star more has to do with Chrome than the hardware. The hardware get 4.5 to 5 stars. Chrome get 3.5 to 4. What missing in Chrome is 1) sftp and SMB - so there's no way to connect to another computer and transfer files. Downloading through the browser is the only way 2) email client - Chrome does not support POP3, SMTP, or imap so web clients is the only way to manage non-gmail accounts. There's no email client like on an Android. 3) Cisco VPN -  Is it bad that I can't use my personal computer to connect to work? The wife doesn't think so.

I almost got the Samsung Chromebook last year when it came out, but decided that the 2 GB of RAM was just slightly not enough for my needs despite the other reviews saying it was adequate. Before purchasing the Chromebook, I used my 3rd generation iPad as my secondary device. Although I really liked my iPad, when it came down to typing anything or doing any serious multitasking, it didn't do well. With the C720 coming out, I went ahead and purchased one. Since I've gotten the Chromebook, I am using my iPad less and less because the Chromebook can do everything I used my iPad to do and in most cases it does it better. It's important that people DON'T confuse the Chromebook as meant to be a full computer replacement (although I'd imagine for some people it could be). The Chromebook is meant to be a great secondary device, like a tablet that is hopped up on caffeine and 'roids. It actually has usable USB ports and an HDMI out which puts it in a weird league between a tablet and a full fledged laptop. It will certainly replace my iPad as my secondary device.The Good:The keyboard and trackpad are more than adequate. Still a thousand times better than NO keyboard on a tablet.It comes with 100 GB of Google Drive storage for two years which is AWESOME.4 GB of RAM is really, really good for a device like this. When I'm doing pretty heavy browsing, I'm using about 2.5 GB at a given time. I don't think I broke 3 GB yet, so there's plenty of headroom.On the note of the RAM, this thing is insanely fast. It boots ridiculously quickly. Everything's very snappy and optimized.The battery life is quite good. I have no issues getting a whole day out of it with plenty of battery life to spare before I bother to plug it in.The screen is OK. The pixel density is pretty decent as it's pretty small. I wish the vertical viewing angles were better, but it's certainly passable. Horizontal viewing angles are totally fine and brightness is quite good.The Bummers:When plugging the Chromebook to a TV through HDMI, it defaults to an extended display. This is generally fine. This becomes a bummer if you want to switch it back to a mirrored display. The problem is, when you mirror a display, this Chromebook refuses to get the resolution right AND I CANNOT FATHOM WHY! I'm plugging in the Chromebook to a 16:9 TV. The Chromebook has a 16:9 display. When mirroring, it mirrors a 4:3 signal to both screens. WHAT? WHY?! I wouldn't even care if the TV upscaled the 1366x768 Chromebook native resolution, as long as it mirrored properly! I haven't the foggiest if this is a Linux shortcoming, an Intel graphics shortcoming, or an Xorg shortcoming. It's kind of irritating. However, this is nit-picky and it EXTENDS displays flawlessly, but that now involves me dragging over the window playing video to the TV which is an extra step.Now, as I'm watching a video, I naturally want to dim the display as much as possible as to not distract myself from the big screen. When you set the dimness down ALL the way, ChromeOS think it's smarter than you and turns off that display. Which is smart to save power, but then is irritating as surely the video you were watching on the TV has now been buried under the other windows you had on your Chromebook's display and now you have to bring it back to the top as the TV has become the Chromebook's only display. This is why I prefer just to mirror displays. This is actually genuinely annoying. I hope that this can be fixed in a software update in the future.It's also a bummer that Chrome OS doesn't include any sort of built-in network sharing that I could find. Certainly nothing by default in the Files app. By this, I mean I cannot access shared media on my network such as movies from my NAS, Mac, or PC. There IS Plex but that's weird to set up and doesn't work nicely in my limited experience. I gave up on it because this wasn't that much of a big deal to me. If I can be bothered, I can always install Xubuntu on the Chromebook and have Network sharing that way. On the note of network video sharing, the Chromebook cannot play purchased iTunes movies because it isn't compatible with Apple's FairPlay DRM. This is a bummer, but isn't the fault of the Chromebook in any way. Blame the big video studios that insist that DRM still exist.Overall, I really like my Chromebook, and for the price, I really cannot complain too much. You get FANTASTIC hardware for $250, and the Google Drive promotion makes it really hard to beat. If you were thinking about getting a Chromebook and fully understand what its purpose is, I say this is a fantastic value.

So why did I buy this Acer product? I've panned the Acer brand for years (often with good reason), but I think I'm going to have to change my tune just a bit.My daughter (10) has been wanting a laptop for a while, but as much as I wanted to keep this Apple household all-Mac, I just couldn't envision her fumbling about with a $1000 MacBook Air as her first computer. Secondly, her school uses these Chromebooks in the classroom...which told me they must hold up a bit if they survive classrooms of 5th graders!).I had to educate myself on this Chromebook phenomenon before a penny would be spent on a sub $300 laptop as a Christmas gift. My timing couldn't have been better. It seems Chromebooks are just maturing enough (hardware, better Google OS, etc.) to where they are game-changers in the computer market. These laptops are truly barebones, but these latest models from HP and Acer kick things up a notch. Here's what I've learned...The key to good performance on these Internet-hungry devices is RAM. After reading tons of reviews, articles, etc., it seems users of Chromebooks gripe about one thing...sluggishness when their Chromebook has several tabs open (lack of RAM). So this particular model of the C720 came with the maximum RAM in a Chromebook (as of this review): 4GB. That should future-proof this purchase for a while and I highly recommend a 4GB Chromebook over a 2GB. This C720 model also has a newer processor in it that allows it to increase battery life way beyond previous generation Chromebooks. The latest HP Chromebook is much more stylish than this Acer, but after they halted sales due to a fire hazard found in its power supply, that scared me off.This Acer C720 is no beauty pageant winner, but it is lightweight, solidly built (for plastic build quality, that is), and fit and finish are pretty impressive. The 11 inch screen is not Retina-quality a la MacBook or iPad, but come on! It's for my 10-year-old daughter looking up American history and other homework-related work. It can run some casual games and we might get a few apps for fun, but this laptop only has 16 GB of storage (that's tiny). Google gives us 100GB of online \"cloud\" storage for 2 years (you pay after that), but without Internet, you can't access it. In fact, I wouldn't recommend a Chromebook unless you always have it able to access the Internet. Why? Most of the apps are online, not stored on the device. This laptop is silent...no fan noise, no hard drive noise, and barely any heat felt when it is in your lap. The power supply is small and the \"brick\" only gets a tad warm, not hot like some others.My experience so far...upon taking it out of the box, I plugged it in and it booted up immediately (5 seconds or so and it was wait for me to login to my wireless network in the house. Of course, we have an Apple Airport Extreme base station for broadcasting wireless throughout the house and it connected without issue. It then proceeded to discover some updates, and it ran those and rebooted. You need a Google account to be able to use a Chromebook. It gives you a \"browse as guest\" option, but that gives you just the Chrome browser. Google doesn't allow kids under 13 to have Google accounts, so I created a family Google account we all could use on it. You're greeted with a welcome screen showing all the possibilities this thing can do. I was actually quite surprised. I watched a Youtube video (speakers sound pretty decent...even though they are on the bottom!), visited the Google App Store and added (note I didn't say \"downloaded\") some free apps like Netflix, Pandora, etc. to the Chromebook. These are likely shortcuts to the online version of these services/apps, since nothing really got downloaded to the tiny 16GB hard drive.The trackpad is not glass, but it supports multiple gestures including two finger scrolling. To click things you can press down on the entire trackpad to get the \"click\", but you can also just lightly tap the trackpad for the same effect. The keyboard is similar to the slim keys found on Apple's computer keyboards, although these Acer keys seemed a bit more lightweight. As a touch typist, I was able to adapt fairly quickly. I like using a mouse, and most any USB mouse should work with this Chromebook. It also supports Bluetooth, so you could use a wireless mouse and keyboard. This thing even has HDMI output, so you could connect it to an HDTV, then use a wireless mouse/keyboard to access everything.One reason for the 1-star deduction: printing. This \"Cloud Print\" feature sounds cool if you have a printer that supports wireless printing. If not, you can add a \"classic printer\" that is connected to a computer elsewhere in your house...but it's a headache. Using a Mac or PC, you need the Chrome browser, you have to login to the same account that the Chromebook uses, then go into settings, advanced settings....get the picture? I finally got it set-up, but watch out for that one. Another one: setting the correct time. Geesh. Why can't I click on the clock on the screen and edit it? Instead, settings > advanced settings, etc.I must say, as a Mac user, I am pleased with this purchase. It's no Mac and probably won't last as long, but it is super fast, the Chrome (browser) interface is easy to get around, and battery life is really impressive (haven't tested it to the limit, but 8 hours isn't unexpected, unless you're watching streamed videos).Pros:-Ultra-fast boot up.-4GB RAM keeps sluggish performance away.-Automatic updates and no viruses to deal with.-Wireless reception is good, bluetooth support and HDTV connection is gravy!Cons:-Setting up printing is a pain.-Setting the clock is a pain (yea, really).-Wish the hard drive stored more things for offline laptop use.Overall, out of all the Chromebooks out there as of this review, I think I made the right choice.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "What I've been waiting for", "Author": "Robert S.

I like it, but I do wish they could have had a easy-to-understand menu, so it could be easier to access your files, and transfer them so you don't have to worry about making a copy and storing them into the Google Cloud service. But nevertheless, it is worth the wait and the money to give it a shot. Especially in this day in age, for anyone that wants a tablet or laptop for all their needs.It has excellent Wi-Fi and works brilliant with speed and ease. This is something I recommend for anyone that is just too afraid of bringing a hefty laptop or tablet on the go. With the speed and price to match.Price: B+Setup & Convience: B-Overall: B", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like a lot and then found enormous security hole", "Author": "Steven Naron", "ReviewID": "R2JLI3RPO8KVCK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I liked Chromebook a lot until just sent an email from the account of the last user to use the machine even though they had signed off.

CHROMEBOOK NONTOUCH IS STILL BEST VALUE FOR YOUR DOLLAR!First you all, it's easy to judge my POV as being disingenuous. Vast majority of Chromebooks users will no doubt view me this way but before writing me off, I'm just like you! Originally a googler user on a Netscape browsers since 1996! Google continues to push innovation year after year, Chromebooks are no exception. One of the goals they had with Chromebook was connecting the lower class to the Web.To do this they engineered a Browser like OS(chromeOS). Software with low resource requirements in keeping prices down. Customarily  to get online needed a $600laptop  but mid 2011 google changed that with Chromebook @ $200!before all that ,the tech companies tried this as well! The industry created a new category called \"netbooks\" laptops 2007. Cheap but slow, a deal breaker! WHY? because the technology wasn't there yet.  Thus, we the consumer market correlated the terms NETBOOKS CHEAP Laptops = unusable SLOW.  LOL  Chromebooks changed all that a few years ago. Finally a cheap but fast machine at a fraction of a price are now at the hands of the budget conscious buyers. Is it a full working laptop? Definitely not. But it's perfectly fine for people needing to browse the internets... at least for now.Then another \"cause and effect\" shift in innovation occurred in the industry.  \"Cause\" > MOBILE devices boom, \"EFFECT\" > Faster Tech evolution.INTEL & AMD's new SoC and APU chips. To the novice readers, those two companies are the brain power of the industry.  AND the latest shift in innovation occurred late (October) 2013, higher level of processing power paved way reengineered \"Netbooks\"* to match Chromebooks affordability but offering users usability a full functionality of Windows OS and not just a Browser backboned OS(ChromeOS). The Technology finally caught up.11-14\" Touch Laptops w/ advanced SoC/APU based notebooks from various OEM are bringing back \"NETBOOK\" category to life. These was what Asus EeePC shoud have been in 2008.  But unfortunately, our frustrating experience of NETBOOKS in years past is hard to forget, the damage has already been done.  Unless you're curious enough to give it another go...and i did.Honestly I didn't expect much but I was shocked.  All i can say is you dont need$700 to have a fast windows... its possible on a $380 and bonus its a touch screen notebook!  Granted the notebook i used had a post October 2013 APU variant.TOP 10 Cheap ($280-$399) TOUCH NOTEBOOKS.Typically between 11.6\" to under 14\" touchscreens, 3.7 lbs or below in weight.This is for buyers looking for functional, portable, light weight, bang for your buck notebooks.(update new No.1) HP Touchsmart 11(Prices changes daily, listed price may cost less or more)(Hours has been spent updating this list, pls thumbs up to motivate me even more)NO.1  +/- $335 HP Pavilion 11-e015nr TouchSmart 11.6\" Touch Screen - AMD Elite Quad-Core A6-1450(06/01/2013) / 4GB DDR3 / 320GB HD / Windows 8 64-bit OSOR from a different seller here...

DEAL! but downgraded the Hard Drive , Touch, 4GB, / one of the better CPU/APU options in this category for gaming(Portal 2 and Torchlight 2 on high settings but lag free! /Upgradable to 8GB verified)CONS: 320GB instead of 500GB, HP build quality is avg compared to ASUS or Lenovo but thats subjective.  Prices fluctuates too much, if sellers increase their prices closer to $400 i would not recommend buying this or any 11.6\" note books. Because at $400 asking price, you can find a better spec notebook at 14\" touch screen size.

You can get frustrated quickly if you intend to do more than browsing the internet due to low spec parts.PROS: Cheap price, good tool for Web,email, and other light activity only.

But honestly at $450-$499 Price range there's far more models to pick from but one should expect to have 14\" touch screen or bigger, A8-EliteQuadcore APU processor or Intel i3, 6GB Ram, and 650GB Harddrive . 2x USB 3.0 at the very least.

TIP:  Visit Lenovo,Asus,HP,Dell,Toshiba websites and research their latest budget model lines as those models will have the must updates CPUs in them. Dont relay on Amazon's 3rd party sellers cause i discovered that more than +/-70% of laptops being sold  here are outdated as i did my research.for +/- $350 netbooks are so available for consumers looking for quick value notebook. And full working compute solution not just a Web Browser disguised as a OS. and BTW all those free Apps on Chromebooks can be used on any Chrome browser running in a Windows notebook, so wouldn't that already defeat the purpose of Chromebooks?Let's compare, I hope you all know that installing a Chrome browser in a pc and running the google apps within the Chrome browser in essence owning chromebook for free ?Plus you don't have to handicap your self w/ limited productivity options on ChromeOS.BUT IF ALL YOU HAVE IS $200, AND ALL I WANT TO IS BROWSE THE INTERNET AT HOME.
