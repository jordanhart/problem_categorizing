Those CORRECT specs include an i3-3110M CPU, Windows 7 Pro installed w/ Windows 8 disks included, 500GB hard drive.  The specs listed in the title of this laptop are HP ProBook 4540s 15.6\" Notebook (2.40 GHz Intel Core i3-2370M, 4 GB RAM, 320 GB 7200 RPM Hard Drive, DVD+/-RW SuperMulti Drive, Windows 7 Home Premium.Basically, the OS is an upgrade, the CPU is an upgrade, the hard drive is an upgrade.  I thought you should know if you are looking at the machine.  Could be a problem if you are trying to buy an exact replacement for some purpose in an enterprise environment, etc.  Otherwise its just getting more than what you paid for.", "Date": "April 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it better than I expected.", "Author": "Jerry Rottman", "ReviewID": "R1T0FUEA49PEKP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first Windows 8 machine.  Windows 8 seems to be all about \"apps\", which I have no interest in.  Initially, the Windows 8 startup screen (apps in your face) was a pain in the neck, but I quickly learned to go quickly to the desktop.  I do, however, appreciate the very rapid startup and shut down of Windows 8.The keyboard has a nice crisp feel, which is a real plus since I do a lot of typing.The reason I gave four stars instead of five is because the touch pad isn't great.  I've only owned two laptops prior to this one, so I don't have a lot to compare to.  Perhaps touch pads are generally lousy.  But, in any event, I've have a lot of trouble controlling the position of the \"mouse pointer\" with the touch pad.  Bought a USB mouse, so this is no longer an issue when I'm working at a desk.  When I'm traveling and don't have a hard surface available for the mouse, I just have to put up with the touch pad.", "Date": "January 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this HP", "Author": "Mary L.
