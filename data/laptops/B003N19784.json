{"Reviews": [{"Title": "At $279 this was practically STOLEN! Ignoring the speaker, I'm AMAZED.", "Author": "Anonymous \"Anonymous\"", "ReviewID": "R2XYS304MS3ANB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop purely out of the compelling nature of the Amazon Lightning Deal price of $279 plus the specifications of the unit (since then it seems they've made the deal price the standard one, for now).  I own a computer service business, so I know exactly how to research laptops for potential purchase down to the component level, and here's why I decided to make the buy:* CPU: It might be a cheap Celeron, but it has a 1MB cache and 64-bit capability, and is based on the Core 2 processor; DEFINITELY far more powerful than any netbook, and in my tests it plays 720p high-definition H.264 video clips without a single hitch.  The lower cache is also somewhat mitigated by the dual-channel DDR3 memory.* RAM: 2GB of dual-channel DDR3.  Enough said.  It's the latest and greatest kind of memory, and there's enough to get most typical things done.  You could even run Photoshop if you wanted, and it'd be fine.* Hard drive: 160GB SATA...pretty small by today's standards, but it's way more than most people will use, including myself since I have a desktop for all the big stuff.* DVD-RW drive: YES, IT BURNS DVDs.  Very compelling, particularly since netbooks' main missing feature is an optical drive.* 15.6\" widescreen: you can easily buy a laptop for $300 more and get a smaller screen.  The image is crisp and I absolutely can't complain.  The resolution is really good, also.  Plenty of video real estate to get things done.* Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit: 64-bit!  Not Starter Edition!  Not Vista!  What more could you ask for?  (Also, Linux works great on it; I checked!)* This thing isn't a 17\" laptop, yet it has a numeric keypad!  Not a full one, but just the fact that it has the standard 0-9 and Enter matrix in the proper place is amazing, and awfully handy for keeping those pesky financial records!Some people will not like the lack of a webcam, but the most annoying compromise is the sound.  While you can easily connect a set of speakers and get wonderful sound, the built-in speaker is mono (there is only one speaker), very quiet, and has a very poor response range.  It's sufficient for hearing sounds such as a mail notification (if ambient noise in the room is low), but it's insufficient for almost everything else, including listening to music.  Honestly, most people could care less about the missing cam and pitiful speaker, especially at this price point.  It's powerful, it gets the job done and does so at great speed, and the feature list is absolutely shocking for a $279 unit.  If I was evaluating this at its \"normal\" $399 price, I would advise coughing up an extra $100 and buying a dual-core unit with 4GB and a 320GB hard drive instead, but the $120 off makes this an absolutely unbeatable offer.  In fact, I've already helped three other people purchase one since mine was delivered and I evaluated it first-hand.If you get this at a good price, you absolutely won't be sorry.  Just buy it!", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "A great basic, get the job done laptop. Super value at $279", "Author": "W. cun", "ReviewID": "R2DRF1UV6TV45I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered the laptop using my Prime account on Monday and it arrived two days later, as promised. The laptop comes in a simple, cardboard eMachines box with basic instructions: Put in Battery, Plug in, Turn on.Upon opening the monitor, I notice shelling is made of a thin, flat black plastic. A little on the cheap side, but this laptop is not meant to go off-road. Acceptable. The monitor is wide and very crisp. I was very disappointed in the video card. Granted, it is an integrated 4500M, but the resolution display cannot go any higher than 1366x768. I like my icons and screen to appear smaller, so I can essentially fit more onto my screen. The keys are well spaced and firm to the touch, so there is no accidental key-pressing. There is also an integrated accounting key-pad on the right, something my previous Compaq M2100 did not have, a plus for accounting/econ majors. The power cord seems pretty sturdy. Unlike my previous Compaq which was victim of a weak neck, the power cord is a 90 degree plug and reinforced with thicker amounts of synthetic plastic/rubber. Finally, the laptop weighs in at 5.65 pounds.This laptop will be used for basic everyday use: Internet Browsing, Mail, Social networking, remote networking into work, MS Office and Videos/Music. I do not plan on using any photo or movie editing programs. I was able to browse the internet a bit. I checked my mail and social networks. The laptop seems efficient, but when I attempted to run two tabbed windows (Car Forum and Ytube) at once, one of the windows (YTube) crashed! Luckily, it was quickly recovered Windows. Not a big deal for people with patience, but I always run multiple tabs so this might be a problem in the future.The laptop comes with Windows 7 64-bit, a plus. It also comes with a 60 day trial of Microsoft office and Norton antivirus.Overall, I really like the laptop. It lacks power in the dated Celeron processor but makes up for in a strong wireless 802.11b/g/n card, a nice sleek monitor and 160GB available hard drive for storing movies, music and pictures.For $279 (Amazon Lightning Deal), I am very satisfied with my purchase!*EDIT*I was able to fool around with the new laptop some more last night. In total, I used the laptop for about 1.5 hours, MAX. The first 60 minutes comprised of basic internet browsing: Fbook, Amazon.com, and YouTube. Since I did not have available Wi-Fi, I tethered my HTC Snap. Sadly, because I was in the hills of Hollywood, I got very poor reception so my internet was sluggish. I skipped the YTube and stayed on Meebo for some chat.My next laptop session was later that night at my apartment. I picked up the apartment's Wi-Fi quickly and web pages loaded normally, but nothing phenomenal. The wireless card works well, as expected.As an avid music junkie, I noticed the Mono-speaker is VERY under powered. I opened Pandora while I was cooking in the kitchen. The noise from the overhead oven vent clashed with the weaker speaker from the laptop. The speakers in my old Compaq M2100 were much stronger. Granted, they were stereo. However, if you have a pair of headphones, watching movies on a plane, car ride or late at night easily solves this problem.After I shut down, my battery life read 57%. Not bad for about 1.5 hours of web browsing and music streaming while using a mixture of Tether/Wi-Fi. Let me also add, whenever I am not plugged into AC power, I set my screen brightness to the lowest to conserve the laptop's power.Again, I STILL believe this is a GREAT laptop for the price.", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent deal", "Author": "Sami Ben Grine", "ReviewID": "RE3D5YP388CZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This looks like an Acer Aspire AS5734Z-4512 NoteBook except it comes with a single core processor (Acer owns Gateway and eMachines).I am expecting accessories to be well supported and compatible between both brands.At $279, this laptop is an excellent deal. Ordered on Wednesday, delivered before noon on Thursday.The laptop is lightweight (lighter than my 13\" Apple MacBook) and responsive (DVDs play seamlessly).It just takes a couple of minutes to configure it. I was able to connect my WPA2 Wireless N network with no issue.The power adapter accepts up to 240V and the power cord is detachable - this should be usable in Europe.A webcam would have been a nice addition.Pros:Large and bright screenFull keyboard with keypadWindows 7 licenseMinimal bloatwareIntel processor and video chipsetReasonably fast and responsiveUp and running in two minutesReads DVDs out of the boxBattery comes half chargedCons:Single core processorNo webcamLow powered speakerKeypad skews keyboard to the right", "Date": "August 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive & Capable", "Author": "David Wilkins", "ReviewID": "R2O7BA9A5JY5AV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the past two weeks or so, I had been on the prowl for the cheapest laptop or net book I could find, as I needed something portable to use with a module on my motorcycle.  Constantly lugging the desktop outside simply wouldn't do.I happened across this machine during a lightening deal (which seems to sporadically going in and out of effect for the past two to three days).  For the price, this is an extremely capable machine, understandably with no extras to keep the price as low as it is.Pros:Minimal software is included, but free options (Open Office, GIMP, VLC, iTunes) all run very decently.DVD playback is adequate, although there is some hiccuping as the drive \"spools\" up initially, but is fine after a few seconds.The wireless card works better then I would have expected, and has about the same range as my MacBook Pro.I couldn't easily locate it before purchase, but the screen resolution is 1366 x 768.Minimal pre-installed bloatware.Plays Solitaire fine, I wouldn't trust it for anything more intensive than that though.I was spoiled my Apples' trackpad included with their newest MacBook Pro, but the trackpad on here works quite nicely.  While not being multi-touch capable, the included drivers / utilities allow you to set up sections to use as scrolling (for webpages), simulate momentum scrolling, and have hot-sections for gestures / commands.Cons:The lid does feel a little flimsy, but under normal use doesn't seem like it should be problematic.Very cheap, mono-speaker.  If you're going to watch movies or play music, make sure you have some headphones.If all you need as a bare-bones laptop, this machine is perfect.  Just about the same price as (if not cheaper than) a good number of netbooks, which gives you an optical drive, at the trade-off of battery life.  A little shy of an hour and a half of web browsing forums with brightness at minimum took the battery from full charge to about 45%.

Sauer \"f2x\"", "ReviewID": "RL5A2CLXMEJ1V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received this computer 4 days ago, and most of what I've read in the prior reviews is fairly accurate. This computer is a real bargain. At the risk of overlap, I'll cover the basics:It's got a nice big glossy 16:9 screen. The glare can be annoying, but it looks shiny and bright.The keyboard is wide, and there is a number pad on the right. The layout is going to take some getting used to... by habit I keep missing the arrow keys and hit the numpad's enter key by mistake. Otherwise, the keys are large and easy to find.There are only two USB ports. Well... Two is good.It has a DVD burner. I really like this a lot. I've been a netbook user for some time, and carrying around a separate device for reading and writing to CD/DVD really defeated the whole portability aspect of the netbook.It's got 2GB of RAM. Of course this is shared with the video, but there's still plenty left over to handle your personal activities.The hard drive is small; effectively 149.05GB. It is divided into 3 partitions: 12GB, 102MB, and 137GB. The 12GB is used to restore the system, the 102MB is some kind of system reserved space, and the 137GB is your OS and user space.As noted by others, the speaker (singular) is rather poor. But hooking up to external speakers or headphones negates this limitation. Besides... Even the best built-in laptop speakers are never that great.No built in webcam or microphone. Personally I look at this as a privacy benefit. Malicious software can not be used to spy on you. You can always hook into the built in microphone jack and connect a USB webcam if you must.You can connect it to an external VGA monitor or projector. Higher resolutions are available on them if you do so.There is a LAN connection on it. Does anyone still use those? Well, it's there if you need it.The WiFi works just fine. It's finding hotspots all over the place, so no complaints there.Battery life is a solid 4 hours, and it seems to charge fairly quickly. This will probably degrade over time, but it meets expectations.Booting and shutdown is fast! Of course if you start to load bloatware, your mileage may vary.It's Windows 7 Home Premium. I was using XP before. My experience with Vista on others computers was miserable, but this seems to work quite well, and I can get to the \"guts\" of it intuitively using my knowledge of XP.The card slot is on the front. I put in a 16GB SDHC card with GNU/Linux and it booted up like magic! Alternate boot devices is achieved by pressing F12 when you power on.The case itself feels a little flexible. You might consider it flimsy, but I like to think that if it bends, it doesn't break.The processor is a 64 bit single core processor. At just over 2GHz it's fast and friendly.So far, I like this computer. I recommend having 4 blank DVDs when you first turn it on to make your backup disks, and you'll be set.

Speakers- are you kidding me u shouldnt be using a laptop for it speakers bring along some noise canceling headphones (I use my ipod earbuds, and I'm ordering some better ones!) chassis- you shouldnt be ruff with ur laptop anyways (get a good laptop backpack/case/sleeve or something) - Power cord- get over it yah' baby you shouldnt be putting tension or stepping on it anyhow! trackpad- its suprisingly functional go in to its options and speed it up a bit and its perfect for me. webcam- im sure you can buy a portable webcam if you just need that function I really dont use webcams so no problemo for me.other then that. you will make every1 jealous!!! hehehe when they get their lame netbook you can laugh as u got twice as powerful machine for less. okay, so I think I've made up ur mind by now? if I haven't then who cares; i thought i should atleast make a couple people aware of this awesome deal muhahaha.god bless. and forgive for grammar, spelling, and the likes :) afterall this is the internet - Nathan out!", "Date": "August 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect Laptop For The Price", "Author": "Ryan \"U2NUMB\"", "ReviewID": "R1JE5W1GT53WNB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this laptop today thanks to the fantastic deal Amazon had going on.

While I say that, I have to say that I tend to be a bit `hard' on laptops.  I'm an extremely mobile person, and not always the most graceful-the eMachine has managed to keep up with my mobility without any problems.  It is durable/compact machine.While some have complained about the 1 speaker, I'm okay with it because the 1 is actually louder than the stereo speakers on my old laptop.  However, as another reviewer has noted, it doesn't offer the same quality of sound that a laptop with 2 speakers would.I have 2 `complaints' and at that, these would not keep me from purchasing this machine again.  The first being the lack of USB ports; there are only 2 in a world where most of us have at least 2 if not 3 or 4 USB driven electronic items.  Second would be that I'd like to have had more memory, but an external hard drive isn't that big of a deal.So over all, I love my eMachine.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "techytech", "ReviewID": "R3O5I7I1Q75AVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall great performance, and for the price i got it for ($279, amazon sale) it was a steal!!!I have this now for 7 months, and the only thing i can complain about is 1)no webcam, 2)speaker(s) are[is] pretty low, but with earphones or external speakers it works just fine!!!!", "Date": "March 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "emachines laptop", "Author": "buddybear", "ReviewID": "RTDLCHLSYT7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great laptop for the price.... just wish it had 2 speakers instead of the mono 1.... other than that super fast and just an all around great machine", "Date": "January 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Ghost Rider", "ReviewID": "R2IQVMWL1STKEF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this laptop for 4 months now and this is a Great computer!
