{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent 11.6 inch Windows 7 Notebook", "Author": "Edward J. Doura", "ReviewID": "R2G1KKD9R4WE4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Long story short.  I wanted an inexpensive 11.6 inch notebook with Windows 7 to travel with and use in and around my home.  I found it with the Acer V5-131-2629.When I discovered this Windows 7 laptop, I was excited to find that it was still available in mass quantities.  In fact, mine was manufactured only a couple of months ago.  I really didn't want to go the Windows 8 route for what I was trying to accomplish with this laptop.This laptop had everything I was looking for; Windows 7 Home Premium, Intel Celeron 1007U 1.5 GHz dual core processor, 11.6\" screen (1366x768), 4GB DDR3 ram memory, 500GB hard drive, Intel GMA HD Graphics, WIFI A, G, N and Bluetooth 4.0.  It also has three USB ports (2.0) and not 3.0 as advertised along with HDMI, VGA and Ethernet ports.  It also comes with a 6-cell lithium ion battery with a battery life of 6.5 hours.  The battery does protrude at the bottom of the laptop, but in turn gives it a nice angle to use.  You can order a four cell battery replacement if you want a slimmer and flush look to the laptop at the expense of battery life.  I ordered one and will use the 6-cell battery as a spare.The laptop itself has a great design and form factor.  If you have seen Acer's Chromebook C710 11.6\" laptop, this is the same exact laptop, but in black and the inclusion of Windows 7. The chiclet keyboard and screen are very good.  It is very easy to open the back panel for any user upgrades such as upgrading the ram or hard drive to an SSD.  All you have to do is remove one screw and slide the back panel off.After using this laptop, I'm very pleased with it.  The Windows Experience Index rates it 4.4 out of the box with no upgrades. It is very fast and has no problems streaming 1080p video.  I have noticed no lag at all.If you want the flexibility of a laptop without the limitations of a tablet, this Acer laptop offers lots of bang and a real good look for the buck.  I strongly recommend it.I have a video of the laptop hands on.  Check out my youtube channel HDiNDEMAND.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Notebook for the Price", "Author": "P.

Other than not being a fan of click pads (industry standard these days) and the lousy internal speakers, it's hard for me to find things about this notebook I don't like, especially considering the $350 price tag. I was surprised to see that Acer didn't cheap out and provided a nice 6-cell battery.I had pretty specific criteria when considering a replacement for my old model:-A low-end CULV ivy bridge intel CPU that doesn't produce too much heat-RAM expansion up to at least 8GB-11.6\" Matte LCD screen-Windows 7 or Linux-Decent battery life (4+ hours per charge in real world use)-Low CostThis was really the only one out there I could find that met all my demands.I also learned that Celeron 1007U in this model has Intel HD 2500 graphics, which is supposed to be supported in OSX 10.8, so this could possibly be a good contender for running OSX86.I'll give this one 4.5/5 stars for the lousy speakers (you get what you pay for)", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I made a good choice.", "Author": "Jennifer Dages", "ReviewID": "R134L7ZDE44GAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I only got this laptop this week I am very pleased with it.  I was looking for something in between a regular laptop and a tablet and this is it.  It only weights about 3 lbs which is perfect.  It still has a full keyboard and a 12 inch screen so it is not hard for me to use but it is light to carry around.  I did order a case for it.  It came easy to set up for a wireless network.  I got Skype loaded right away and it is great b/c it has a camera installed so works well with Skype.  I wanted Windows 7 and it has that so I am also pleased with that.  So far the battery life seems decent and I am trying to keep it charged up for when I leave the house with it.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price, I'm liking it a lot", "Author": "Hawke", "ReviewID": "R2SU9SAQF70Z4K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the laptop for a few days, so this is just a first impressions, but it seems pretty good so far. My last laptop was a 17\" ASUS gaming machine, which performed admirably, but having since built my own desktop and really settling into the college life, I found myself wanting something smaller and less cumbersome, not to mention that the ASUS had been slowly developing problems ever since I bought it about 4 years ago.So for this purchase, I was looking for something cheap, mostly as a mobile programming terminal, and this thing performs quite well in that aspect. It's quite small and lightweight, and has some really good battery life. I turned it on this morning at about 11 o'clock to check a few things before going to class and have had it on -or at least asleep- ever since (for reference, it's about 5:30 and I still have 28% remaining, which the computer claims is still well over an hour). It's certainly better than my old laptop which only just recently (thanks to a driver update) managed to pull just over 2 hours.The only downsides so far are that the speakers are pretty awful, but then again this should be expected and is easily counteracted by some earbuds or external speakers, and the mousepad is a little hard to use if you have big hands, but I pretty much always carry a wireless mouse with me anyways, so that still hardly an issue.Overall:Pros-* Good battery life (easily 5-6 hours, more if you put it to sleep when not in use and dim the screen)* Nice keyboard, even for those with large hands* Decent boot time (takes about 45 seconds or so; could be made faster with an SSD)* Comes with Windows 7, for those of us that still enjoy the interfaceCons-* Speakers are bad (but why would you be using them anyway?)* Touchpad is mediocre and takes some fiddling to work with, but workableWill update if anything of note comes up.[Random Update: 3/22/2014]It's been a little over a semester since I bought this thing, so I guess a quick update couldn't hurt.Since finishing out the last semester, I've replaced the Windows 7 install with #! [Crunchbang] Linux. It took the replacement very well, though trying to get the Bluetooth to work properly under the new OS is proving quite annoying (not that I ever used it anyway :P).Still, it works beautifully. It runs a few games really well under Linux, and under Windows it would run things like Risk of Rain and Hearthstone quite well. Bumping up the star rating since I've gotten used to the touch pad and I'm still loving it some 6 months later.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is a great little PC", "Author": "johnw", "ReviewID": "R33K9C6B00W3ZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had an Acer Aspire One AO150 for a few years and have been very pleased with it. Unfortunately, it runs XP and Microsoft is dropping support next April. I really didn't want Windows 8 so I felt between a rock and a hard place. The V5 has helped me escape this dilemma.  While small and light, with great battery time owing to its 6-cell battery, my Aspire One was a netbook, i.e. it had alimited Atom CPU and 1GB of memory, not really enough power to handle upgrading. The V5 doesn't have those limitations. With a Celeron CPU, 4GB memory , 500GB HDD, a full 1366x768 display and HDMI, it has all the features of a low-end 15\" laptop but only weighs 3 lbs. The V5 also has the 6-cell pack and hopefully has the same battery life as the smaller Aspire One.  One thing I really liked about the Aspire One was its keyboard, which was small but had a nice feel, not cheap like the Asus eeePC. The V5 has the same feel but its keyboard about the same size as a 15\" PC, so it's easy to type on.  I really don't know why anyone would want to buy an overpriced, underpowered tablet when the Acer V5 has most of the features ( light weight, long battery life ) and none of the hassles one can have using a tablet. Many people end up adding a keyboard to their tablet - this one has a nice keyboard built-in and only 480+GB more disk space. In sum, the V5 is a real computer, only just a little smaller.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "11.6\" Acer Aspire Notebook", "Author": "Maurice", "ReviewID": "R378NIP0PLS5FA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My three plus year old Acer Aspire one Netbook started to cause me problems, slow and overheating.I found this Acer Aspire V5-131 on Amazon for a good price with Windows 7, which I wanted.They advertised 3 USB 3 ports.

That is why I gave it only 4 stars.It seems like a very good Notebook, small with full size keyboard.Boots in 45 seconds.Battery life is over 5 hours.I ran a two hour movie from the hard drive 2 and 1/2 times until the battery dropped to 10%.  (a little over 5 hours)Screen brightness was on at almost full for the duration of my test.Windows Experience Index is 4.5.

Processor ran at 90 to 100 percent and CPU temp never got over 60 C.I would recommend this laptop it to anyone who needs a simple computer.You should have good eyesite for this small screen though.I might install a solid state drive to give it more speed and longer battery life.Update May 2014:I installed a Samsung model 840, 250GB SSD, and the Windows Experience Index moved up to 6.6.I am ordering another 4 GB of ram from Amazon then I will update this review again.Best travel laptop that I ever had and I have had many since the Window 95 days.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly powerful little laptop. Although not perfect, it is an excellent buy considering the price and functionality.", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R6G43M2QEKZTA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:+Windows 7 64-bit instead of the woeful windows 8 means this laptop is way more user-friendly and less frustrating to use.+Very small, lightweight, and portable!!+Powerful (fully functional PC as opposed to a chromebook that doesn't allow for Microsoft Office etc.)+Fast bootup times and operating system (especially once you remove bloatware and disable unnecessary visual perks)+Long battery life, especially if yours comes with the 6-cell battery (6.5 hour life with low-resource programs)+Wifi works great and it also has bluetooth for wireless mouse, a webcam, and an SD card reader+Has 3 usb ports, a vga output and an HDMI output so it is great for presentations with projectors+Not a touchscreen (those things are so imprecise and frustrating)+Very reasonably priced (especially compared to tablets that are less functional!)Cons:-The 6-cell battery is larger and does not sit flush with laptop case so it makes the laptop sit at an angle. Although this doesn't really impact functionality, it looks a bit odd.-The \"home\" and \"end\" functions can only be used when holding the Function key which takes some getting used to, especially for complex keyboard tasks like \"ctrl, shift, home\" (which becomes \"ctrl, shift, function, home\"). Likewise, the arrow keys and page up/page down keys are very small.-It has a trackpad (though to be fair, I have a bias against all of them). Although the laptop does come with software to customize the trackpad a great deal (including scrolling, two-finger commands, 3-finger commands, etc.), I personally prefer a mouse.-Acer, like most brands nowadays, pre-installs a fair amount of bloatware so it took me an hour or two to get rid of all the unnecessary programs and trial-version software.Final thoughts:If you want a very small, yet powerful windows-based laptop that does not have Windows 8, this is the best one I could find after days of searching. Although it does have a few quirks and some bloatware to remove, after several days of intensive usage in graduate school I must say I am extremely pleased with this product. I got this laptop because I already have a gaming PC at home so I just needed something for grad school so that I could work away from home when needed. If this were my only PC, I would probably get something with a larger screen. That being said, you can always customize windows and zoom-in in your browsers and programs to maximize the monitor it does have. For an on-the-go workstation, this laptop works marvelously. One other thing to keep in mind is that because this laptop does not have a disc-drive, it is advisable to make an image of windows 7 on a usb flash drive, which requires around 14 gb of space.

Both have 11.6\" screens.This newer netbook has no hard drive or network lights.  This makes it a bit harder to subjectively gauge whether the system is actually working or not.  I suspect that the hard drive is a bit slower as well (even though it is twice as large as the older netbook).  I'm not sure why any netbook comes with anything other than an SSD.This newer model is a 2 core with 4GB of RAM; the older netbook was a single core with 2GB of RAM.  I doubled that netbook's RAM to 4GB; I'll eventually double this netbook's RAM to 8GB.There are no left/right buttons on the touch pad the way there was on the older netbook.The keyboard looks cheaper on the new netbook but it is surprisingly good.  I chose this netbook originally because it has a near full size keyboard; this new netbook has a keyboard with \"chicklet\" keys that are about 1/8\" smaller.The USB ports are 2.0.  Why would any computer sold in 2013 NOT have USB 3.0 ports?There was a surprising amount of \"bloatware\" that came with this machine.  I removed 17 separate packages before starting to install my own software.The fan, when it kicks in, is noisier than the older netbook.Now the good things: it has built-in Bluetooth and an SD (multi-card) reader.  The bigger battery causes the netbook to tilt up a little bit when its on a table; I like that angle better than the older netbook.So far, so good.  I'm hoping to use this netbook for a USB wind instrument computer.UPDATE: 11/1624 hours after receiving this computer all networking (wireless/wired) failed.  According to the Device Manager, it didn't see any networking hardware at all.  I re-seated the \"WLAN\" card inside and re-installed the LAN device drivers.

I needed compact size since I would be putting it in my brief case and taking into my insurance office with me every day, then taking it back home and using it there periodically. I also wanted good battery life, so I wouldn't have to plug it in when I was at work. I sometimes have several web pages from standard internet sites, as well as several from the company's intranet servers open at the same time, along with Outlook, and maybe a word doc or two, so I wanted something with at least 4 gig of memory. A good screen was essential after spending 3 years squinting at a dull, washed out old IBM T42.This Aspire V5 has met all of those criteria quite well. It's light and compact so it's very easy to pack up and carry. The battery lasts a solid 4-5.5 hours under fairly rigorous use, and it has enough power to handle doing a number of tasks at once. I occasionally will watch a netflix video or youtube video on it while eating lunch, or before going to bed, and even 1040 hd videos play smoothly. This is a HUGE improvement from my old T42 with 2 gigs of memory running XP. Even 480p videos would stall out and buffer with that one.Only a few small complaints with it. The IBM was slow and antiquated, but it had a GREAT keyboard. This Aspire's keyboard is functional, and that's about it. The track pad is a bit squirrely at times- sometimes too sensitive, and sometimes a bit unresponsive, but it's usable.

When I first got it I found it was loaded with programs I did not want or need and when I removed them the computer seized up and I had to do a factory reboot to get it started again.  It really balked when I removed the factory anti-virus program and added Security Essentials and really gagged when I loaded Microsoft Office. When I add new programs it takes an impossible time to process the additions and I am afraid that the machine has frozen up because it takes it so long to process new additions.  To help solve the processing time problem I decided to upgrade the machine to 8GB RAM and ordered the chips to do the upgrade.  Although Acer advertises the computer as 8 GB machine, there are no instructions in the operator's manual on how to open the machine to add the chips nor can I find the chips for sale on the Acer web site.  After looking for several hours for instructions on how to open the machine to add the chips, I finally gave up and called customer support.  Much to my displeasure, the off shore tech rep I spoke with told me they did not want me to open the machine and that if I did my warranty would be voided.  They declined to give instructions on how to gain access to the RAM chip area.  It appeared that there is an access plate on the bottom of the machine that needed to come off and this is held by a single screw.  I was hesitant to remove the back plate without instructions because it was not obvious whether the plate snapped or slid into position and I did not want to damage it by putting pressure in the wrong place.  I did find an excellent internet site that explained how to open the back plate (it slides to the front after removal of the one retaining screw) and I was able to add the chips to upgrade the machine to 8 GB. The RAM upgrade has not appreciably improved the performance of the computer and at random times it takes considerable time to boot up. The audio volume is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity. As an overall evaluation, it has been a real challenge to purge the machine of garbage software and add the programs I normally use and the customer support from Acer leaves much to be desired.

Light weight and oh so easy to use . . . for those of us who dislike Windows 8, it would seem to be the perfect answer. Tweaking a Windows 8 computer isn't all that difficult but when it has a 'touch screen,' it can be frustrating. The ASUS 11.6\" is a reasonable computer/tablet for $300.00 but it is now in second place.

Out of the box I noticed how small it was and was exactly what I was looking for.  I want the portability of a tablet, without the limitations of a tablet and that's where this laptop comes into play.  It runs Windows 7 which is a plus so you don't have to deal with the Windows 8 nonsense for those who prefer not to use Windows 8 (me included).  It is pretty snappy and starts up in about 30 seconds which is good enough for me.Right away there was tons of bloatware.  It took about an hour of uninstalling to take it off.  But it's simply uninstalling from control panel, not any of the crazy uninstall processes some bloatware makes you go through.  I feel like the keyboard is slightly smaller than a full size one, but after using it for a while you get used to it pretty quick and can make the transition.  Just those few days you will miss a keystroke here and there, but it is nothing big to worry about.  The arrow keys are pretty small, but they are still definitely usable.  The touch pad is the kind where the track pad also pushes down in the appropriate places for left and right mouse clicks.  I have dealt with this kind of touch pad before so it didn't bother me, but I can see how some people hate it.  You can also tap it to click too which leads to accidental clicks sometimes.  The HDMI port is also a very nice feature and is straight plug and play.  The laptop does emit heat after extended use on the bottom and is warm on your lap, but by far less heat produced than any other laptop I have used.Also some people may not realize this laptop does not have a disc drive in it.  All you have to do is simply copy and paste files onto a flash drive or use a cloud service, but for some people that do not have either option then not having a disc drive may be a problem for them.Another huge issue other people complain about are the speakers.  While they are pretty bad, they are still usable.  The sound quality is similar to as if you turn up the volume using headphones and use the headphones on full blast as make-shift speakers.  But once you plug headphones into it, the quality is just fine, so it's not a hardware issue that turns into bad sound all the time.  If you plan on using headphones most of the time, you're fine.I mainly use this when I'm away from my desktop or traveling.  I do game quite a bit and have run many basic games on Steam with it just fine.  I do recommend investing in a wireless mouse if you are not used to gaming with a track pad because it is not for everyone.I eventually upgraded to 8 GB of RAM and the laptop responded and is even snappier.  Definitely a must buy in my book.The few things that are wrong with it are very minor things.  The battery sticks out about two inches.  It gives the keyboard a nice angle to type on when on a desk.  However the product picture shows it being flush, which it definitely is not and may be a deal breaker if that's what you're looking for.  Another thing is sometimes the fan starts making odd noises, I simply tap (very gently) near the fan and it goes away.  It doesn't happen often but it happens once in a while.  The sound as mentioned earlier isn't the best, but it can be solved with headphones.  The visibility of the screen on different angles isn't bad for me at all, I don't mind adjusting the screen and what not but I can see how it would really annoy other people.Pros:- Fast performance- Expandable to 8 GB of RAM- Small & light- Battery life- Quick start up & shut down- Windows 7 (for those who aren't a fan of 8)- Does not get really hot on your lap (other laptops get painfully hot after extended use)Cons:- Battery protrudes- Fan sometimes makes odd noises (quite rare)- Lots of bloatware", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible product", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R27WVYN0CPBQRX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After about 2 months, touchpad gave out on me without any hope of being fixed.

I thought in three years Acer would have been able to improve on this but the opposite is true. The Aspire V5 is absolutely awful. Not only have they eliminated the right/left click buttons, but the sensitivity is even worse and around half the time you are unable to even move the mouse. I spent a lot of time in the control panel trying to adjust the settings with no improvement. There are no updated drivers available for download online.You know how a typical mouse behaves after the trackball gets gunked up with hair and dirt?

I think this is about as good as it gets at anything close to this price point. The machine is lightweight but not flimsy, and I feel comfortable often picking it up and setting it down using the screen as a handle.Power/speed: The V5 boots up from being \"off\" very quickly, and from being on standby it's nearly instantaneous. The half-terabyte hard drive has plenty of room for practically any data you could want to carry (in my case, a library of Amazon Unbox videos to watch while traveling). The power pack is nicely a bit smaller than most.Price: The machine is a bargain for combining good power, low weight, and trim size into a package this price. I did a lot of shopping, and I don't think you can do better.Cons: NOTE that this machine ships with a six-cell battery that significantly alters the size profile, sticking out across the bottom by a good half inch. It is NOT the profile pictured on Amazon, which is the 4-cell battery. Since the machine's slim profile is critical to me, that was a problem. In my case, that problem was solved very nicely when Amazon gave me a $60 credit for the \"problem\", and I was able to buy a 4-cell battery directly from Acer for $30. I now have the battery I want and a higher capacity back-up for less than the initial purchase price.Worst feature: the viewing angle is the worst I've seen on any device. I normally dismiss viewing angle concerns as not too important, since if you're the only person looking at the screen you can just adjust it a smidge here or there to get it the way you want. The viewing angle is so narrow on the Aspire V5, however, that simply shifting up or down in your seat can change the quality of the view, so you have to adjust the screen again to match.

I took my previous netbook to Europe twice and this one is going with me next month. Battery life is important on long flights! I like the touch pad which is light to the touch but for some things I do use a wireless mouse. I have used Skype several times with no problems. What I don't like is that the adapter plugs in on the right ... I prefer the left side then the cord is not draped across my lap. I also don't like that the card slot is in the front ...

On my sweet little Acer I can actually do simple things simply like find what I'm looking for, mass delete junk mail, copy, paste,  print, etc.  I love that little windows are not flying out from all 4 sides of the screen at me if my finger is not perfectly placed on the track pad. Welcome home, Windows 7- I missed you.I watch a lot of videos on Swagbucks.com and they play seamlessly with no crashing. The McAfee free trial it came with is doing a great job filtering potentially harmful content from said videos keeping my Acer safe while I rack up Amazon gift cards!There are 4 small things I am less than thrilled with. There is no light on the keyboard to signal the caps lock is on but an Icon will pop up on screen to let you know which takes some getting used to. A tap on the track pad does not always work- just move your finger slightly and try again. There is no optical drive which would make backing up easier but that's all I would use it for anyway. The battery is good but not as good as the specs indicate which is probably typical. No worries, I will pick up a spare with one of my gift cards.

She works from home and our small business office and when traveling.  Comfort and portability are key to her.  It's common for her to have Word, Excel, an Access database, Outlook, and our proprietary cloud employee management system open at the same time.  This laptop handles it, and my wife has become quite the Windows 7 Toggle Queen.  Rarely uses the office desktop anymore.Once my 80-year-old mother saw and played a bit with my wife's new computer, she wanted one for herself to replace her obsolete XP desktop.  Windows 8 on a full-size laptop for Mom was an absolute non-starter.  Mom uses it for her e-mail, browsing, Quicken and that's about it.  Took it with her on a cross-country trip.  Her biggest pleasure (actually, maybe mine) is instead of having to browse at a desk in a spare bedroom, she now reads her morning news and e-mails at the kitchen table or on the patio, with a cup of coffee.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very functional machine with a decent sized screen", "Author": "cancer", "ReviewID": "R2P03F4MION4VU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Formerly I was using a Toshiba (solid and reliable for 5 years), but this is a better machine than the comparable Toshiba one.

Stancliff", "ReviewID": "RSSZ9VL37D5TQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Main computer use is word processing, web surfing and minor computer based art and photo manipulation. Acer Aspire V5 was purchased after a HP laptop died after three years of rather heavy school use. Main selling points were 4 megs of RAM, 500 meg hard drive and the $340 price at Staples. In the six weeks between the HP dying and my purchasing of the Acer Aspire V5 I sampled a few tablets with the idea that they could adequately replace the HP, I had various issues with each of the tablets but the death knell for all of them was connectivity issues with my printer and their small RAM and hard drives. However, after dealing with this Acer for over a month I feel I would have been better off sticking with the Microsoft Surface. Yes the Acer V5 has 4 megs of RAM, unfortunately the processor takes the speed down to around 1 meg, I had a Gateway 12 years ago that was faster, in all aspects, than this Acer V5. I had to spend a three days scrubbing the bloat ware which was using 90-95% of of the CPU, after uninstalling the mountain of Acer crap it is now running with around 70% of the CPU free, from time to time, however, it starts running slow and shows that 90+% is in use and has to be restarted before it will clear its cache. On top of the memory space issues it also has trouble handling wi-fi signals, connecting isn't an issue, neither is staying connected, where it has issue lies is with the computer accepting that there is in fact internet access. Again, restarting is the only thing that resolves this issue once it starts. On top of those issues I kept getting virus warnings, straight out of the box, from McAfee and Norton both. Downloaded AVG just to make sure and AVG informs me that Windows has been installed incorrectly and is causing a false virus signal. Other issues consist of, touch pad unresponsive to tapping and the scroll is horridly placed (entire right hand edge of touch pad) for a right handed user. The SD card reader is located under the right hand side of the device, an SD card can be inserted without flipping the lap top over, extracting it however is essentially impossible. The SD card reader is slightly recessed and upside down (the nail slot on the card cannot be accessed), if this was a self ejecting slot this would not be an issue, but its not. The first time I used the card reader it took half an hour and a pair of tweezers to remove the card. I will not be using that slot again. All in all I've found the Acer Aspire V5 to be a wonderful, if lightweight and somewhat expensive, paper weight. The chances that I will be purchasing another Acer product in the future are very slim, I didn't expect a super machine, but I did expect something faster and more reliable than a computer I had over a decade ago.", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your time", "Author": "Robbie L.
