{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Finally starting to see some high quality Haswell Windows laptops", "Author": "lukeWA", "ReviewID": "R2TV3EAB8I53P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "-----Note that I'm reviewing the Dell Inspiron 7000 15\" (15-7537).  It is in the same family as this PC, except 15\" vs. 17\", no optical drive, and 8GB memory.-----I just received the Dell 7000 15-7537 yesterday which I bought for my wife. I tried to steer her towards an ultrabook (I have the Lenovo X1 Carbon Touch and it is the best PC I've ever owned), but she didn't like the smaller screens and keyboards. She wanted something more substantial. All the PC manufacturers seem to be going smaller and sleeker, but if you want to buy a straight up laptop the pickings are pretty poor.So I set out to find a laptop with:- touchscreen- haswell CPU- 15\" screen- (at my wife's request) 10 key numerical pad on keyboard- ideally <\u00a31,000My first choice would have been a Lenovo - my last 2 PCs have been Lenovos and they are just great. In the UK, however, they don't seem to yet offer a 15\" haswell laptop other than their gaming rig (not a good choice for my wife). After much looking, I landed on this Dell.First off, let me say that at the end of the search process and some grueling trials in getting the laptop and getting it dialed in I am *very* pleased. Exceeded my expectations and I'm loving this machine. Here are some notes along the way.- Dell's anti-fraud team is atrocious. I recently relocated to the UK from the US and tried to buy the PC initially with our US card but have it shipped to our UK address. This somehow tripped their fraud sensors and the order was silently cancelled with no notification. When I noticed and phoned them up, they were asking for my passport, proof of address, work email address, home land line number, etc. That was crazy - I'm buying a laptop not a nuclear warhead. So I just said screw it and ordered again with my wife's email address and our UK card. Worked great that time.- The delivery ETA on their site is a blatant lie. I ordered on 22 Oct and the page said ETA to arrive was 25 Oct. Then immediately after purchase it changed to 8 Nov. And along the way there was very little status. I kept wondering if it was actually going to come.- The PC did arrive on time on 8 Nov.***Moral of this story - buy from a store or Amazon if you can.  Avoid buying directly from Dell***now onto the machine- Build quality is very nice - much nicer than I expected from pictures and reviews. Feels like a premium PC, more like an Lenovo business class or MacBook pro than the Dells I'm used to.- The screen is gorgeous. I went for the full HD and am really glad. The resolution is great, windows scales reasonable to it, and the touch works flawlessly. It's also very very bright.- The keyboard is fine. I worried that it would be crap, but it's just fine. I prefer my Lenovo keyboard, but this Dell is just fine. My wife is even pickier than I am about keyboards and she had no problems either.- The trackpad is actually very nice. It has an intelligent palm detector so the cursor doesn't dance when you type (your right palm naturally lies on the trackpad). I also bemoan the loss of physical mouse buttons (like I have on my beloved Lenovo), but I've found this one to be just fine. Click and drag, right click, etc all work great. I personally hate windows gestures on a trackpad (esp. when you have the touchscreen) so I disabled them, but two finger scroll and pinch-zoom work well.- The 10 key pad is actually really great. This makes me jealous.- The audio is good quality and reasonably loud. I wish it were a bit louder, but it's OK. Watching movies in bed is great, but if you want to play music while folding laundry and the kids are running around it's not loud enough - need to research a good Bluetooth speaker for my wife for this scenario.- The jury's a bit out on the battery. I haven't done a full rundown yet, and the indicator dances around too much to be credible. Sometimes it will say I have 8 hours left on a full charge and other times it will say 4 hours. Depends on how hard you push it. I have noticed that if you select the Dell power option it seems to do better than the balanced option I typically select. They must have dialed some things in.- No optical drive. My wife had some anxiety here, even though she hasn't used hers more than once or twice in the past year. I bought her an external drive and she was happy with that solution.- The hard drive is a dog. In task manager if you're ever slow you will see the I/O at 99% - it really is the bottleneck of the system. It is plenty fast for what my wife wants to do (facebook, email, Netflix), but it would drive me crazy. I'll upgrade to SSD when 1TB drives get reasonably cheap.*Software*I'm a big fan of windows 8, and I dialed in my wife's Microsoft account, SkyDrive, Xbox Music, office 365, etc. It's actually pretty slick, you get 60 hours a month of free streaming music from Xbox music (basically all you can eat of any artist/track - not like Pandora, just basically iTunes catalog for free with the caveat that you can't download the song). And with o365 we got 60 minutes of Skype worldwide phone calling a month free. It's pretty cool.Impressively little bloatware. I'm typically prone to just wipe the hard drive and start with a pristine copy of windows to avoid all the free trials, junk software, and all the crap in the systray. Pleasant surprise on the Dell, it had little stuff there and was easy to remove what I didn't want (e.g. Dell Backup - I use Carbonite and recommend it or Mozy or other cloud backup software to folks)Also, for the love of all things good, uninstall McAfee. It's redundant and slows everything down.*Drivers*Oh man I had a headache here. I updated to windows 8.1 and then the machine stopped waking from sleep (or responding when the screen went off). I redownloaded drivers, futzed in the bios, messed with the power options, and nothing. I finally contacted Dell and they said it was a known issue and they had just released new drivers for windows 8.1 and a bios update. This solved my problems.So a bit of a process getting things dialed in, but I'm happy and most of all my wife is happy.", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FRSDMV4"}}
