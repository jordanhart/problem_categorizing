Three months after I bought it it started going bad, Dell refused to fix it because they wouldn't honor any of their Warranties, and they refused to sell the parts I needed,  to have it fixed to my local computer repair...Six months after I bought it I had a $3,000 + paper weight..Don't buy a Dell or Alien ware they are so bad they won't even honor their own warranties. I spent two years trying to get them to fix or replace it and they didn't even have the dignity to ever write back. Not worth the trouble!!!!!", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HA1S2HU"}}
