{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dell 1012 Inspiron Mini 10", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R37259W2QILM41", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very happy with the service from the seller, this is only a review on the laptop.My husband and I are in the process of upgrading our home computer: I purchased the mini for my own private use, mostly for Microsoft Word and web surfing (limited - mostly Facebook, email, etc.), so I could go back to using my Nook HD+ as an e-reader and not as a tablet. It really is a nice netbook for this purpose. I think the  main drawback is the netbook I purchased has Windows 7 Starter.  I am going to have an upgrade to Windows 7 Home Premium (and the ram also) - which I will have taken care of by a local computer store since it is an OEM OS installed and I want to play it safe.  As of right now, the only flaws I found with the Dell Inspiron Mini: Windows 7 Starter (waste of an OS); little slow with the 1G; and the screen resolution is low, not as vivid as I would like. I will update this review after the upgrades are completed next week. Windows 7 Starter is very disappointing.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004X835SE"}}
