{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dell's Alien Benchmarks Well Even With I5", "Author": "Let's Compare Options \"Amazon Rocks\"", "ReviewID": "R1FZLT8NU0T56P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Dell's ownership of Alienware hasn't hurt the franchise. I benchmarked this against 5 other machines, all with I7's (except the mac), including Dell's own loaded Inspiron and Asus' loaded laptop. For 400 bucks less: get this! The benchmarks in all categories were NOT notably different than the I7. Of course you also can get this with an I7 but in my case that would be ego, given nearly equal performance with not only heavy gaming, but also running Unity game programming island tree sims, which can even crash the most robust towers.I also hate to say this (because I'm not a big Apple fan), but a little 2011 Macbook at $300 LESS than this met both its and the I7 Dell's benchmarks. Ugh, but true. Sorry to all my fellow PC types.You can beef up Alienware to 3 grand plus like the good old days with ultra premium speakers, more flash, more RAM, etc. but that depends on your goals. If you're just looking for a lightning fast, high horsepower gaming machine that's also ideal for business and general computing, this is a great compromise. Comparing prices and features with tigerdirect, the price points here on Amazon are better, but tiger throws in Windows 8 where this often still comes with 7 (depending on when you read this, check it, it might be up to 8 in a bit).Doesn't matter to me, as 8 shines more with touchscreens and tablets, and frankly machines like the surface are sweet, but deprive you of a lot of \"tablet\" features you'd want like Google play, jelly bean, apps, etc. In that arena, the new Kindle takes the cake, beating out ipad in my humble opinion (see, I did manage to get an Apple jab in, even though I begrudgingly acknowledge mac IS fast). (The one I like is here: Kindle Fire HDX 8.9\", HDX Display, Wi-Fi, 16 GB). I'm also not a big fan of the new appliances like chromebook that need the cloud for everything-- it is still nice to have your own files when wifi isn't around, and I can't afford big data plans ala 4G.Enjoy!Email answers: 1. Yes, Amazon's table has weight wrong, it's 6 pounds.  2. Yes, my comparison is with I5 overclocked to between 3.1 and 3.2. It does not take a lot of work to push the I5, and folks who just leave their I7 untouched out of the box are frankly paying $400 too much! The difference between the tiny overclock possible with 3.4 won't be seen even in the most advanced games (or intense other apps) once you tweak the 5. Also, the 7 is VERY dust and temp sensitive, and loaded inspirons get into auto shut offs constantly.Again, if you are less lazy than I am and frequently pull the cover for dust duty, its not an issue. Thankfully, the fix is usually a 5 minute fur ball removal in most cases! I'm not anti-7 in any sense, but just want to save you money as these AWs can be seriously expensive, and this model is one of the few full featured \"deals\" that really give you a major bang for your buck, even for apps like solving advanced polynomials with NumPy (supercomputer level math!) in addition to ram hogging gaming. If you're in High School, tell your parents this is for solving polynomial inequality competitions, and tell them you also want this book: Polynomials (Problem Books in Mathematics). Hey, if you do gaming too, it's not my fault! If you're a parent--  this IS a serious math machine, really! I teach math as well as game programming and it is a GREAT way for teens to stay interested in tech!!", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!", "Author": "FRANK GRADIA JR", "ReviewID": "R1PV2E5DKG6PLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Honestly i was worried about ordering this model and not jumping onto one of the more expensive models but let me tell you its awesome. I have never written a review of anything on here but i am smitten with this laptop. The keyboard for me is Fantastic! I have been playing some games as well (Assassins Creed, The cave, Portal) and have had no issues. The build quality is a pleasure. At this point i have no complaints. Honestly an i5 processor is more than 95 percent of consumers will ever dream of using.

My ancient computers beat it.I also love the lit keyboard and mouse.Another problem, problem number three, is the way the mouse \"sticks\" at times and won't release ;the curser as I type.  I have to right click the mouse so that it is not dragging the curser arrow all over constantly.For the looks and typing experience nothing can beat this.  And it does weigh a ton. YOu won't want to keep this on your lap.Sigh.  So many problems right out of the box. I sadly won't be getting another replacement for this.  I have no idea how this could have been sold having so many problems.  Oh and just now when I tried to click on the submit button with the mouse, the entire screen resized by itself.

The graphics performance is up to my most demanding games. Though I will run on High rather than Ultra (this is a GT 750m, not a GTX 750m, after all), that modest compromise is hardly noticeable. The performance/screen size tradeoff (1360 x 768, rather than full HD) is a good configuration as well; the graphics, particle effects, ambient occlusion, and so on, are as you would expect. The smaller screen lessens the vertigo I sometimes get with my desktop monitors (dual 27-inch diagonal LCD panels).I was particularly happy to discover that one of the ports was actually a headset port, which is perfect for using Teamspeak and Skype.This was a refurbished unit, and I've been very pleased indeed with the quality and performance of the machine.

When an agent spoke to me, he said that the order was all good and that I should disregard the notices. Next day, the order was canceled. This had happened twice more after renewing the orders. Finally, I've had enough and vowed that I will never buy a Dell product ever again in my life although this was my first time. Boy, this was a bizarre shopping experience.
