As far as I know this would mean a resolution of 1920x1080.Instead it has a max resolution of 1600x900. The description from Amazon is confusing and I didn't expect this from them.Apart from this and the annoying assistants at startup (which you can'd disable), the VAIO is OK.", "Date": "August 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Another great Sony VAIO laptop", "Author": "V.

I didn't open the box for about one month, because I have 2 other Laptops an Apple and a HP.Then I used this Sony for about 2 months as a desktop, but not that much, so I didn't move or bring this Sony on th go. Then for somehow it builds moisture inside the LCD, I believe due to the hot weather, I contacted Sony Support, they asked me to send the unit to Sony Repair in San Diego which I did and they received the unit on 10.05.2009. Yesterday on 10.20.2009 at 8 pm I got an email saying that the repair estimate is USD 699.99 plus tax, whaaaaaat?...I called right away asked them to send it back, this is crazy...I just can not believe that this is a SONY, one of the biggest company in electronics/multimedia/movie industry.I will never ever buy a sony anymore...Below is the email that I got from Sony Repair:Dear Valued Sony CustomerWe have completed the repair estimate for your unit based on theinformation you provided us.
