I live in a very rural place,so my internet connection isn't the fastest.but so far its working good.  The only thing wrong is the battery life isn't as long as they say. My sons say thats how most laptops are. I am still learning how to use it,so far good. Price was very good,when I compared it to other brands similiar to it. Now I will have to decide on a virus,spyware protection plan,since it only came with a 30 day Mcafee trail. So far so good.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Under powered", "Author": "Stewart1206", "ReviewID": "R2XWUSUTGTN1BW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this for someone else, but couldn't give it to them.

Maria", "ReviewID": "R33LPJ8XA9U0OE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a very good laptop. Aside from the one year warranty, I appreciate ASUS included this laptop in its accidental damage program (ADP) which is good for a year but one has to register this computer within 60 days.  My touchscreen cracked because of an accident and ASUS service center replaced the screen right away free of charge. Thank you very much ASUS.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.00", "Features": "Intel Core i3-3217U 1.8 GHz\n4 GB DDR3\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 8, 5-hour battery life", "Name": "ASUS K550CA-DH31T 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Laptop (Silver Grey)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51BhJsr4SxL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EZUZFSS"}}
