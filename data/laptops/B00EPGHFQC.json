Still, it's impressive for an integrated unit.--The SSD's in RAID are incredibly quick, and really help cut down boot time to just about 10 seconds from cold. I'm up and running in no time.--The battery life is actually 8 hours or more on normal use. Way to go Haswell processor. You're not an energy sink.--At just over 3 pounds, this laptop is so light, and remarkably thin.I've had it for a week, and there is nothing I can complain about, and I feel I'm rather picky about my electronics.If you have the money, and are frustrated about how it seems many ultrabooks have to compromise in some area, this is a stellar laptop.--UPDATE--I've had this ultrabook for about four weeks now, and unfortunately, I noticed a small linear scratch on the lid. I bring this up because the GorillaGlass3 covering the lid is reported to be nearly scratch-proof against anything but sand. I've been very careful with this laptop, carrying it in a case whenever I transport it, and I was hoping it would be more scratch resistant than it's shaping up to be. Still, this is an excellent product, and I'm still impressed by its outstanding performance.--Update--After 5 months, I am still extremely satisfied with this ultrabook. I can work through an entire day at school on a single battery charge, and not sacrifice performance. This thing hasn't slowed down at all. And for those of you that care, it'll produce fluent framerates for games like Skyrim (High textures, no antialiasing,) Deus Ex: Human Revolution (High settings,) and Mass Effect 3 on ultra graphics settings. Light, fast, powerful, this is still the laptop I had hoped for five months ago.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "Nato", "ReviewID": "RLRLL37AP6AJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It took 3 generations but Asus has finally fixed all the problems and perfected their Zenbook line.-This thing is unbelievably well constructed, everything FEELS as solid as it should given its price.-The touchpad works great-The keyboard is backlit and the keys even register corner presses-The screen, besides being 1440p, is also extremely bright, which somewhat makes up for the glossy screen required by the inclusion of a touch screen-The haswell processor has apparently increased the battery life significantly over the previous generations.In addition to all of the above, this thing is literally the most beautiful device I have ever seen and since everything visible is covered in Gorilla Glass 3, that isn't likely to change as its unlikely that a laptop will encounter sand, which is the only common thing that will scratch GG3.If you have the money, there are no compromises made with this laptop(except for high end gaming due to lack of discrete video card) as long as you are willing to wipe it down with the included giant lens cloth every once in a while to keep it looking pristine.Update: I have noticed recently that the wireless adapter sometimes needs to be reset after the computer sleeps in order to function properly. It has only happened twice so far and I figure this is a driver issue that will be addressed by an update.Update 2: It looks like maybe a windows update fixed the wireless card issue?

They both have very similar specs, but ultimately I chose the Asus for the following reasons:1) Better processor and graphics.  You get the 2.8 ghz i7 with Iris graphics.  The Samsung only offers the lower-tier 1.8 Ghz without Iris.2)  Better wi-fi.  The Asus has the newest-generation ac wireless.  Samsung is still a generation behind.3)  Seemingly better build quality, but this is largely a wash.4)  30-day zero dead pixel guarantee.  When you've got screens with as many millions of pixels as these have, that's a nice thing to have!  (My screen was flawless though).5)  Some nice add ons.  The Asus comes with an included ethernet dongle and an included mini display port/VGA dongle.6)  I feel silly saying it, but a bit of cache.  The Asus is generally more difficult to find and there are fewer of them out in the wild.I have been very impressed with this machine so far.  It truly is gorgeous.  The build quality appears to be very good.  I could not identify any manufacturing flaws, and the whole thing feels rock solid.  The keyboard is excellent, as is the trackpad.  Very little bloatware.  Screen was perfect.  I've been impressed with the performance and I'm still testing the battery life.  I'll update my review once I've had a chance to test it further.This is expensive indeed, but it oozes premium ultrabook from all corners.UPDATE:After using this machine for the last two months I remain very satisfied.  The performance has been excellent and the gorilla glass really seems to stand up to scratches.  The exterior continues to look brand new.I haven't experienced any technical issues with any of the hardware. The keyboard remains very pleasant to use and the trackpad is really outstanding.  On par with anything that Apple puts out.I have received many compliments on the quality and clarity of the screen.Battery life has generally been very good.  With typical internet use and medium brightness, I'm getting 7-9 hours on average.  The battery also charges very quickly, which is a nice bonus.One minor annoyance has to do with Windows and not the hardware.  The resolution on the screen is so high that you will want to use the Windows interface to increase font and icon sizes in almost all cases.  This works fine, except when you need to use the machine for remote access (such as through a VPN or using a vmWare client).  The increase in font and icon sizes does not carry through to a remote session, so you will end up with microscopic icons.  The solution is that you have to change your screen resolution before logging into a remote session.  This isn't a huge deal but it's a bit of an annoyance.  Again, however, this is a Windows 8 issue and not an ASUS issue.All in all I am extremely impressed with this ultrabook.", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS has a winner on their hands for those willing to pay the premium price to own.", "Author": "Jonathan", "ReviewID": "RNIFM0JECIX3N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been waiting for this ultrabook to release since the start of the fall semester. Well, it's definitely been worth the wait. The computer boots up insanely fast due to the RAID 0 SSD configuration. It is not bogged down by a ton of bloatware either. The only changes I've made so far were to uninstall McAfee for Norton 2014 (since I had one license left).One minor gripe I have is the drive partitioning. I would have preferred one partition to how ASUS partitioned the drive into C: (OS) and D: (DATA) in addition to smaller recovery partitions, but I am not taking a star off for that. If it was that big a deal, somebody could (through software) change the partitions however they liked. I was able to merge the C: and D: drive partitions into one C: partition using 3rd party software.The high resolution screen is very nice. The look, feel, and portability of this laptop are second to none.

The keyboard on this one feels much better than the previous version (I haven't noticed anything odd about the spacebar.)  Backlit keys is a plus.  Also, the charging port seems less flimsy.

Based on performance, this laptop will not let you down.  Boot up time is lightning quick, SSD storage is ample, and the Haswell chip appears to deliver on that elusive extended battery life.However, at this price point you expect perfection, and when my laptop came with that tiny gray spec I couldn't seem to wipe off the screen, I began to feel discouraged. So I eagerly waited a month for Amazon's next shipment to come in, and replaced the laptop as soon as I could.  Unfortunately, when the second laptop also arrived with a similar gray spec in a different location on the screen, I began to feel annoyed. I started to think perhaps this was dust or debris trapped under the glass due to poor assembly, but after examining both laptop screens with a digital microscope it appeared that the affected pixels were in fact \"faded\". Not fully on, but not completely off either.Since I had not seen any other reviews highlighting this issue, I opted for another replacement in hopes of receiving one free of defects.  When the third arrived with a similar tiny dark dot in a third separate location on the screen, I began to feel disappointed.  Under magnification, this one appears to be a completely dead red pixel with faded green.I suspect others have this same issue, but simply have not noticed it.  On a screen resolution of this magnitude, these defects can be considered negligible and unnoticeable.  Unless you examine your screen closely on a solid colored background, you could go the life of your computer without ever seeing it.  But once you do find them, it becomes hard not to notice them.  So again, if you expect perfection at this price point, you may want to look somewhere else.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Finally the perfect laptop", "Author": "Neil E.

I've resorted to just keeping the driver installer on the computer and when the wireless stop works, I just uninstall and reinstall the driver. Takes me about 5 minutes to fix. If anyone else has this issue with the Intel driver, this is the only solution I know of. You can get the driver installer from Intel's somewhat bad website, took me some time to find it.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2 Months LaterMost of the scaling issues that I had talked about in this review have sorted themselves out, and I think Microsoft had some updates that made the scaling alot better on this screen.I've had some issues with the wireless adapter on this computer. Its really fast, but sometimes it does not want to turn on. Usually performing the latest Windows Update fixes this, but I just updated to the latest Intel driver for the Wireless. This can be annoying if you don't have the Ethernet to USB adapter that came with the laptop. I've had wireless adapter issues with other Windows 8 laptops, so I'm not going to deduct any more stars for issue that doesn't take more than a couple minutes to fix, albeit an issue that is annoying.I bought Asus's ASUS External Slim 8X DVD-RW Stylish Cut Design Optical Drive SDRW-08D2S-U/BLK/G/AS External DVD drive b/c I have software on disk that I will need. The USB drives likes to take up two USB ports, which cannot be done on this laptop due to the length of the USB cables on the DVD drive and the locations of the USB ports on the laptop. I didn't find this to be an issue as I was able to use the drive with only 1 USB port plugged for the drive.Another thing, if you have this computer's power port plugged in, you can charge over USB. I like this feature alot as on trips I don't have to worry about bringing 4 different chargers, I can just use their USB cables and plug them into the laptop. (Not sure if they will charge if the computer is turned off, but they will charge if the lid shut.)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------4 Days LaterThe boot time (from pressing the power button to Login Screen) is just under 7 seconds. The weight is listed as 2.6lbs but in reality is closer to 3.2lbs. Not sure where they got that number but it is way off.This thing is very quiet and runs very cool and feels cool when doing non-performance intensive tasks. I don't think I've heard the fan run at all or had the bottom heat up. Very good air management by Asus here.The speakers are amazing. I was suprised at how nice they are considering the laptop speakers I've had in the past were not that great.Very little bloat or ad ware installed. The only thing I've had to disable was the Asus Cloud Manager.Some Complaints: The Asus Audio manager is a good piece of software (lots of settings), but without changing any settings, just plugging in the headphones while watching a movie will just keep the sound going to the speakers. You have to leave the netflix app and move back to desktop to say that you are using headphones. I need to do some fiddling with the Audio Manager.Windows8, but that's not really against the laptop, but against Microsoft.I wish the SD card when inserted was more flush with the side of the computer. It kind of hangs out there and I am worried I could break the card/port I/someone was not paying attention.Gaming: I've installed the popular MOBA League of Legends and while I've had yet the time to get specific numbers here are my impressions.1. It can run the game.2. You still get some of the weird scaling issues I discussed before with the 2560x1440 screen. Nothing abnormal, just may look different to a 1920x1080 screen of the same size. Not necessarily bad, I just wouldn't say the experience has been fine-tuned.3. You can play it at the med-lowest setting but the game still feels a little sluggish. I will see if I can push it to the lowest and see if I can get an enjoyable experience out of it.I also plan to put TF2 and L4D2 on it to measure my experience there, but I need to cut out some time to do that.Overall I am still very happy with how this purchase has turned out despite some of the flaws with the scaling.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Original Out of the Box ReviewPros:This is the best screen I have ever seen on a laptop. Super Crisp, can maintain its brightness, and movies look fantastic in it.The size is incredible. Pretty light, super thin. Going to be able to fit it easily in my bag with books.The battery life out of the box is also good. Able to watch movies for a good amount of time and still have decent battery. I trust the 8 hour figure people have out there.I have nothing against the keyboard and touch-pad. The back lighting is good on the keyboard.The packaging was incredible. It can with a laptop sleeve and a soft cloth and it was a nice touch.This thing is quick. Like super quick. The SSD's make it boot incredibly fast, and the for basic tasks I don't feel slowed down at all.  (I have yet to run any performance intensive tasks, but I will soon, just have the get them running.)This thing is quiet. Despite having such a high quality screen, the i7 Haswell chip is fantastic and it handles most of the basic tasks I've thrown at it with ease.Cons:There is some serious issues with the scaling in Windows 8 and this 2560x1440 screen. The computer came automatically at 150% zoom. And while this is enough for the some of the Windows applications, I have found issues with Google Chrome and using web pages. I had to set Google Chrome to automatically zoom to 175% when viewing web pages. can be annoying when using the touchscreen for more precision tasks, but I have had no issue using the touch-pad. As high resolution in smaller screens for laptops/ultrabooks become more common, I wish Microsoft had anticipated this and I hope they do more for this in the future. I wish I could deduct half a star for this, but it is an issue and I will be removing a full star for this.Windows 8. Not as bad with the touchscreen, but still pretty bad. I look to change the aesthetics with add-ons to make it more like Windows 7.This thing is a fingerprint-magnet. The glass on the top displays them like a work of art. I don't really notice them on the touch screen when it's on, but when it's off you'll see them. The soft cloth will wipe most of them away, but its a losing battle.I am not entirely comfortable with power button right above the backspace key. I feel like you could hit it accidentally. I have not hit it yet on accident, but I am more careful when reaching for the backspace key.Other Thoughts:The charger port is on the left side. Neither a plus or a minus, just pointing it out.The size is pretty small. I have a 2tb external hard drive so not much of an issue for me, but it could be for others out there.The intake/exhaust setup is alittle weird. The intake is on the bottom and the exhaust is almost on the back and points up toward the screen when the laptop is turned on. I haven't had any issue with it, but it is not my most desirable position for the exhaust.Again, I'll be updating this review with more thoughts the longer I have it.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Everything I hoped it would be", "Author": "Joseph", "ReviewID": "R2EQS4CUSE43CV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did an incredible amount of Ultrabook research before ordering this, and had concerns about some of the negative feedback I saw. I just got the unit today, and am pleased to report I am not seeing those issues. Specifically:- I don't see light bleed or \"smoky grey\" blacks - the black is a good solid black- There are no squeaky keys (including the space bar) and no keys that seem not fitted right- I see absolutely no build quality issues whatsoever, all panels fit seamlessly with each other- Sure, the screen has some torsion if you try to bend it, but that's because it's about 4mm thick, but it's not all bendy-like, it's just if you try to force it to see if you can, it will bend a bit.- I have not tested all the ports, I'm still doing the windows updates right now. I'm looking forward to using Windows 8.1 pro because it should provide better support for home networking, like having my libraries populate from the media server attached to my router.I tested the picture quality by loading The Hobbit in 1080p - gorgeous!! I like to watch movies on my notebook, it was one of the main reasons I bought this machine, and actually already have an MSI GE620 i7 laptop and was not satisfied with the screen quality, so this mattered the most to me, and I definitely made the right call there!The machine is thin but it's built solid. Unlike the Sony Vaio Pro, you can pick it up by a corner while it's open, and there is no flex whatsoever, it stays rock solid. The trackpad is huge and works perfectly. Looks-wise, the machine is absolutely stunning. I like the look better than a MacBook Air, and definitely better than a MacBook Pro.Viewing angles, I've seen people consistently complain about this, but I can turn this machine sideways and peek around the screen and still see the picture. I angled it right, left, up, down, no change, at any angle, always nice and clear.If I had to complain about one thing, it's that having the power button right beside the delete key is pretty scary, what a dumb idea. That's my only complaint. I wanted the best windows ultrabook on the market, Iris graphics were a must, and lots of SSD hard drive space was a must, and I feel that I made the right call.

Results came back as just over 400MB write and just under 800MB read. So to say the least, its pretty fast. The iris graphic is integrated but packs more punch than most would think. It is comparable to a GTX 740M or GTX 650M (ie mid grade graphics cards) but with less heat output. Processor is 4th gen so it carries the haswell power saving giving me 8 hours of websurfing or youtube videos and about 3 hours in performance mode for games. This also comes with adaptors for USB to RJ-45 (Ethernet), and Displayport mini to VGA.All-in-all, this is a marvelous machine that is only rivaled by my gaming rig. It may be expensive and with it's cons but I am very satisfied.*update*Its been 2 months now and I am still extremely pleased with this product. I only have to charge it every 2 or 3 days when I'm just doing school work but when I hook it up to my tv to watch something and open up the movie, it starts to take its toll on the battery. I can get a good long movie (2 1/2 hours) in if I have about 50 percent battery but I think that's because I can't have it in power savings mode or else the movie will skip and not play properly. A few more cons I have discovered are disappointing but not critical. I have discovered that this laptop is not a gaming machine, it can handle minecraft but generates a lot of heat and it can not handle titanfall or other similar games without graphical errors. The resolution (one of the major selling points) also has its downfalls. The first is that it runs into compatibility issues with several programs and even windows (until recently, I believe that the issue no longer exists) meaning that icons can be sized incorrectly and such. Other than that, its still amazing. I can program on it with without it devouring the battery and can still keep myself entertained between classes.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to be completely prepared for the next generation of computer technology (aside from the lack of 802.11 AC) and has the deep enough wallet to buy it", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Machine Hampered By Some Tough Problems", "Author": "Ray", "ReviewID": "R2JLZUA3L5PWQR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The machine is powerful, good looking, lightweight and very well put together, but comes hampered with a few major and minor flaws that undermine its usefulness.  Some of these can be addressed by sophisticated users, some cannot.Comparing this laptop to my previous Vaio Z with a 7 series processor and a raid 0 solid state drive setup, I find this machine to operate more than twice as fast at about the same weight, although lacking the previous laptop's built in optical drive.  When comparing display speed, the Zenbook trumps even the discrete video card in the older machine.  The keyboard is also better in general, proving better tactile response for faster typing.Display quality is excellent, heat is low, fans are well controlled and quiet, and battery life is reasonable for such a high power machine (although not out of the box as explained below).  The chassis and screen surround are solid and well-constructed.  The slight display flex is not a problem to me, designs that flex are often stronger in the long run than rigid ones.  Yes, there are semi-sharp edges on the front of the machine, but unless you press your hands against them for long periods they are not even noticed.Battery Life ProblemThe power consumption when running on battery is far higher than it should be, often resulting in battery run times of 2 hours even while doing relatively low power tasks such as surfing the web.  The reason is the Minimum Processor State in the advanced power settings is routinely set by the laptop's software to 100%.  Even if this is manually reset to 5% or 10%, the software soon overrides it.  Throttling the processor speed is a major component of the Haswell approach to power reduction, so defeating it kills battery life.After many hours of research and trial and error I was able to solve this problem.  The Asus touchpad software called Smart Gesture is the basic culprit.  In order to quickly respond to touches and gestures it cranks the processor speed and then for some reason, leaves it high even when no touch is occurring.  By replacing this with the Elantech drivers from the manufacturer and then removing the Asus Powergear power control (which was interfering with the Elantech driver) the problem was solved.  Now I see about 4 -7 hours of battery life depending on operations and processor speeds dropping to the 10% range (from 3.2 GHz max). Please note however it is still possible to drop to the 2 hour range when running intensive 3D graphics or games.Wi-Fi ProblemWhen connecting to some Wi-Fi hotspots in hotels or public places the laptop will connect, but show no internet connectivity.  The problem is the machine cannot locate the DNS server.  I have researched this problem extensively and still am not sure of the fix.  It appears it may be a function of the interaction of Windows 8.1 and the Intel Wi-Fi adapter/firmware in the machine, and may be fixed by drilling down to the Internet Protocol version 4 properties and forcing the laptop to \"Obtain DNS server address automatically\".  However, I cannot confirm this as it only worked in one instance.Appearance ProblemsThe glass surface on top of the laptop is beautiful; until you touch it.  In normal use it looks horrible, covered with smears and prints.  This means either just living with it as an ugly machine or constantly cleaning the cover.  I am at the point where I carry a stack of the lens cleaning packets in my bag, using them literally all the time.  It's just amazing to me that no one at Asus picked up on this.  A true engineering disaster.There are LEDs that turn on under the power and F2 (Wi-Fi power) keys.  They are so bright and the keys so badly formed into the case that light leaks out and shines brightly into your eyes when typing in a darkened room.

I'm sorry for the length, but I wanted to be thorough:Things I likeWhat people say is true: it's very well built, sleek and classy.- It is super light. The first week I had it, it literally almost flew out of my hands twice, because I was so used to a heavier laptop.- The keyboard has a nice feel. The material is very smooth, and the keys are not super loud. The keys do not click when you tap them; it's more of a satisfying tap. The weight for the keys is great. I love having a backlit keyboard, too.- The screen is beautiful. I am a dabbler in photography, and this screen lets me work on photos without owning a Macbook retina. The screen is bright enough that I can even work outside, which I have done in the shade and in the sun. It's pushing it a little bit to work in direct sunlight, but mostly because of the smudges that the screen collects (comments on that below), not because of the brightness.- Speaking of working on photos, I love that this laptop has an SD-card slot. Weirdly, the card sticks out about halfway, which is a little annoying, but I'm willing to overlook that - I'm just happy I don't need an adapter for that.- Touchscreen. I've never had another touch screen laptop, so I don't have anything to compare this to, but it seems pretty sensitive. No, it's not as accurate as the touchpad, but when I click on text, my cursor usually ends up within a letter or so of where I wanted to be.- Touchpad. People say it's a touchy touchpad. Well, it is definitely fast. Asus pre-configures the touchpad to have certain features which can be confusing at first if you don't know what they are. For example, brushing three fingers up will cause all the applications you have open to show on screen. Brushing with two fingers will scroll. And brushing the right side of the touchpad will cause the windows 8 menu to come up. There are several more of these features. I have shut a few of them off because I did find that sometimes they caused windows to move when I didn't want to. But it's an easy fix. Having done that, I love how responsive the touchpad is.- Power. I can multitask to my heart's content on this thing. I have run Skype, IE with youtube, Chrome, iTunes, Word, and Excel simultaneously and had zero problems (except that I couldn't keep track of all the windows, haha). I have not yet tried doing all this on top of photo editing software, but I don't anticipate any problems.- Battery life. This thing lasts for hours. The only time I've had to charge it more than once in one day was when I was skyping all day (my fiance and I are long distance) and I was working on top of that (I work from home, using my laptop).- Sound. The speakers are impressive for the size of this laptop.- Bonuses - Asus included a micro to full-sized HDMI USB converter with the laptop, as well as a USB Ethernet adapter -- both in a little black durable-feeling Asus bag. I haven't used either yet, but I am happy they were thoughtful enough to do that. The laptop also came with a navy sleeve and a black microfiber cloth. I like both and use them all the time.Some negatives:- I am among those who hate Windows 8. I really don't find it intuitive, and I do think that it's my biggest complaint about this laptop. Still, it's not Asus' fault that Windows messed up with Windows 8, so I can't hold that against them.- Chrome users should beware. I used to only use Google Chrome as a browser. Google chrome is so buggy on this laptop that it isn't even worth using. Part of it is probably that it doesn't play nice with Windows 8. But basic functions like the scroll bar don't work. Or click and drag (trying to click the top of the window and move it) doesn't work the majority of the time. I actually can't even use the mouse to drag the right side of Chrome to make the window bigger -- I can only use my finger (on the touchscreen). It's been frustrating, but I avoid the frustration now by using IE instead. In any case, this isn't Asus' fault, either.- Smudging. This is possibly my biggest complaint. I wanted to get the Zenbook in white, but I couldn't find it in white anywhere when I was laptop shopping (and I couldn't really wait, because the spacebar on my other laptop was going). I would guess that white would hide smudges better. The front of this laptop (and of course, the touchscreen) are always gathering smudges. Asus includes a microfiber cloth and a case with the laptop, though, and the cloth works great. The keyboard's brushed material is definitely better than the screen and the gorilla glass material, although every few days, I still feel like I need to rub down the keyboard with a slightly damp cloth armed lightly with non-abrasive soap. That said, I'm kind of a neat freak. But it does bother me.- When I first got it, it had trouble randomly dropping the internet. After the first day, I have not had any problems, so I am hoping that it was a hiccup. Thus, it's a more neutral observation at the moment.- When I have worked outside in sunlight, I have noticed that the screen/top of the laptop gets extremely hot. This made me nervous, so I took my laptop back inside. Because it's a dark color, I think it takes in heat. Nothing bad happened, but I think I'm still likely to avoid using my laptop in the sun.Some neutrals:- There are a lot of pixels, so if you have your programs (internet or Microsoft word, for example) at 100%, they are going to look tiny. However, these settings are easily fixed (I am not a tech-wiz, but I have been able to figure them out easily).- Yes, it has a 'sharp' edge as part of its sleek design. Some people complain that it digs into their wrists. I have found that there can be some pressure in my wrists sometimes, but only if I'm lying down and using my wrists to help balance my laptop on my lap. So I shift my position of the laptop, and I'm fine.- People have also complained that the power key is where the delete key is on other laptops. This is true, and it took me a little bit to get over the reflex, but I honestly can't remember one time where I've accidentally hit the power key. Even if I had, this thing goes to sleep in mere seconds, and it wakes up nearly instantaneously. If someone accidentally hit the power button rather than delete, it would not cost them more than an extra 5 seconds of his/her life.I've only had this laptop for a month-ish, so if things change drastically, I will update my review. I'm very happy with this laptop, and I'd highly recommend it. I haven't run into a problem where I felt like Asus was cutting corners - this really does feel and act like a top-of-the-line laptop with maximum portability. As a student and as someone who works from home, I need a lot from my laptop. Beyond that, I'm planning a wedding, and all my \"free\" time is taken up with Excel spreadsheets, Pinterest, and e-mailing people by the dozen.

It ends up that you need to register separately from the normal product registration. You need to email adp@asus.com with name/serial/model/address. Just felt like I needed to update my review.Thanks Asus-- original review --I picked up the highest end model available (UX301LA-XH72T) and it is honestly the best laptop I've ever used. While I personally dislike Windows 8, I was able to install Linux with no problems. I do dual boot with Windows 8.1, but the only reason I booted into the WIndows side was to throw Steam on and test some gaming with Iris -- which certainly did acceptably well.Aside from that I don't use this thing to mine bitcoins, or really actually game (I have loaded up ESO a couple times while visiting friends/family, to trade gear or quest a little), but I do have a few virtual machines running on it at any given time, and it handles them flawlessly. I'm the type of guy who likes the latest and greatest, and usually gets bored of a product and sells it to friends or family -- I did with the first Zenbook I grabbed. The coworker i sold it to loves it, and still uses it.I had a previous model of Zenbook (UX31E), and noted that it had an accidental damage warranty for a year. One of the deciding factors between me grabbing the UX301 and a Samsung Ativ Book 9 Plus was the accidental damage warranty that came with the Asus machine.The problem though, is that one day my laptop was sitting in my bag (normal over the shoulder bag), on my desk at work. I had it opened because I was about to grab it, but was turned around by a coworker. A few seconds later, it had slid out of the bag and the corner hit the floor and dented the bottom left of the keybaord/shattered the glass on the bottom left palm rest (the screen/side opposite the screen was fine).I opened a normal case with Asus, and was asked to RMA it. A few days later, I got an email stating that this wasn't covered under warranty. I've emailed back with the quote from the product page, so we'll see how this goes.

However, Amazon promptly provided a replacement after I reported the issue; I returned the original.The replacement UX301LA I received did not have those problems.  I run Arch Linux on it and everything I've tried so far works (I haven't tried bluetooth yet).  The fonts / GUI elements are too small, but that was an expected problem.  The keyboard is a bit squeaky. Overall, I'm happy with the laptop.  However, there is one issue that has caused some trouble & nervousness.Occasionally when I power on the laptop, the fan starts to race; when this happens I quickly power down the laptop.  However, after that, when I power on the laptop again, the LED on the power cord plug blinks red and green, and the battery does not charge.  So far, I've been able to work around this by allowing the OS to boot, disconnecting the power plug, syncing the file systems (sync; sync; sync) and holding down the power button for several seconds until the laptop powers off.  Then plug in the power cable again, and hopefully the plug LED goes from steady red to steady green after a few seconds, and the battery charges correctly again.This has only happened 2 or 3 times since I bought the laptop; usually it powers on & charges without problem.

Dunn", "ReviewID": "ROBK3QJOQ9TSV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop to replace a previous Asus notebook that was from the Thin & Light series a few years ago. (Its graphics card was fizzling out...*apparently* you're not supposed to drop computers repeatedly; too bad I am a massive klutz.) Between my husband and I, we have previously owned 4 Asus notebooks and have been pretty happy with them.When I began searching for a new laptop, I considered a wide range of brands, both PCs and Macs. My husband, as a software designer, is relatively knowledgeable about computery things. Our priorities in a computer are very different: I wanted a thin, light and pretty computer that I could tote to work with me daily without having to worry about a power cord. He wanted me to be able to play Skyrim with him. The only solution to a compromise was to make a spreadsheet comparing important specs of various computers.This Zenbook was the only one that exceeded all of our spec and attractiveness \"requirements\"--except for price. I wanted to stay under $1500, but we decided that a faster processor would be worth it in the long run, and I think we were right.PROS:I've had it for a little over a week now, and I've updated to Windows 8.1 (it's not THAT bad, guys!). Battery life is between 6-9+ hours on the \"power saving\" mode, depending on how much and for what I use it (I'm generally running powerpoint, reading PDFs, surfing the internet, writing documents, etc. at work). It's very fast and responsive, and I have been enjoying a touchscreen and the excellent trackpad. It is quite sexy (especially after staring at my coworkers' MacBook Airs all the time...this computer is roughly the same size, but much nicer looking). I can play Elder Scrolls Online (a game that came out a month ago) on medium-high graphics (though frame rate is noticeably better on medium-low).Yeah, the cover gets fingerprints on it. So did my brushed aluminum and various textured-plastic laptop covers. Get over it. Also, the \"sharp edges\" other people have complained about do not bother me at all.CONS:The computer does weigh 3.2lbs, rather than the advertised 2.6lbs. Not sure how noticeable that is, but it's bizarre that it is reported as over a half-pound lighter than it is. The power button is also right where the delete key normally is on a keyboard, like other people have said, and I have put it into sleep mode several times by accident (not too much of a problem, since it will boot back up in just a few seconds...but still annoying). Trackpad functions have a bit of a learning curve--I spent the first several hours with it accidentally switching windows because my finger got too close to the edge, but now that I have gotten used to it, I appreciate that function. ALSO: there's no regular HDMI slot--only a micro-HDMI.

The screen is gorgeous, the machine feels solid, the keyboard is good, the trackpad is pretty good, with a few issues (that might have more to do with my hand positions), and I find the battery life great compared to my last laptop.I'm not a computer expert by any means and don't know what people mean when they talk about changing the BIOS etc etc. However, I have to use some fairly demanding software (Adobe CS and ArcGIS), so I end up getting computers that are more high end than my computer expertise really merits, so my issues may not bother people with more knowledge because they know how to customize better than I. That being said, the problems I have with it include:- The wireless network adapter is a lemon, or something to do with the wireless is a lemon anyway. Frequently (more and more frequently as time goes on) if I change locations to a different network or sometimes with the laptop just staying in the same place, it disconnects from the network and then says there are no networks available. Which is bogus, because all my other devices are hooked up to the network. I have to run a fix through the network control panel, and it says it has to \"repair\" the adapter connection. Sometimes even that doesn't work and I have to reboot the whole computer. This is VERY annoying and unacceptable in a brand new laptop at this price point.- As others have mentioned, the high-res screen is great for images, but too many programs can't adjust for it and text becomes microscopic. I've become much more dependent on reading glasses since I bought this.The trackpad is hypersensitive and 1) frequently randomly makes the screen zoom in or out - I have no idea what it is doing or how to stop it, and 2) CONSTANTLY randomly activates the metro menu, taking me away from the program I am working on and the desktop environment I like working in - I don't know how to turn that off either, if it's even possible. Both are very annoying when you're in the middle of something.- My older version of Photoshop is not working well with it because of the screen resolution issues. The suggested fix (changing the resolution to some other percentage than the default) doesn't seem to work, rendering the cursor useless and thus Photoshop fine-scale editing capabilities useless.- it's not as bad as HP, but there are still too many useless apps preloaded that I don't want", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "256gb version", "Author": "Hector Arambula", "ReviewID": "R2720PIG3N5BY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this for about a month and I have nothing negative to say about it.
