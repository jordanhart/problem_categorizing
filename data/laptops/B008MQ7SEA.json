I had tried some of the resolution enhancers for MacBooks so that I could see more on-screen, but they just weren't cutting it on the 11\" screen.  I ordered the 13\" Air and loaded a resolution changer on it, but when I scaled the screen up from the 1440X900 to 1600X1050, the text was fuzzy and hard to read.  I used it for about 2 weeks then the Retina MacBook Pro 13\" came out.  I saw that it weighed only 1/2 pound more and was slightly smaller length/width-wise than the 13\" Air, so I've sent the 13\" Air back and got the 13\" Pro with Retina display.  I've been comfortably using it at 1600X1050 (and I didn't need the resolution enhancers because scaling of the Retina display is built in with four resolutions included).  The Air is light and very thin, so it's quite portable.  You know how the air tapers from the back to the front?  Well, the Pro with Retina is as thick as the back of the Air to give you an idea.  The Air and the Pro are both great machines, but the Pro fits my use case better because of the scalability of the screen.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008MQ7SEA"}}
