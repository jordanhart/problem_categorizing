{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Powerful yet annoying", "Author": "Michael Somar", "ReviewID": "R148EWU285POM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a new laptop to replace my 7 yr. old Dell workhorse which was on its last leg.  I'm not one to splurge on electronics and so to replace it I targeted sub $500 laptops, being more concerned about features and longevity than looks.  In terms of features and longevity for the price this laptop fit the bill:-  4th Gen i5 processor-  HDMI- USB 3 ports- Comes with 6 GB of RAM but it's upgradeable to 16 GB- Wireless N and Bluetooth, both of which are upgradeable as wellAn eSATA port and touchscreen would have been the icing on the cake in terms of my future-proofing needs/wants, but for the price I'm not going to complain.In terms of looks and quality of the build:-  The case is plastic, but it's fairly rugged.  I'm not worried about it cracking or breaking in the long run.  Looks-wise it's black and boring - not a show stopper by any means.  The matte finish does pick up grease from your fingers and so you end up with shiny spots here and there.  They wipe off easy enough though.-  The keys on the keyboard are perfectly spaced for people with big hands, a plus for me but may not be for others.-  The left-click right-click touchpad buttons... they make the LOUDEST clicking noise I've ever heard on a laptop (i've worked as a tech before and have had my hands on several thousand laptops).  My wife hates the noise so much so that I can't use this laptop anywhere near her when she's trying to relax or sleep.  I was able to rectify this problem by pulling apart the laptop and putting caulk between each button and contact point.  The buttons make no noise at all now as hard plastic is no longer smacking down on bare metal or circuit board, but I do not recommend performing this procedure unless you are absolutely comfortable with electronic repair work as this will void your warranty.  One shouldn't have to go to this extreme for a quieter click, and it was evident that the clicking noise is a manufacturing issue and not a problem with the individual laptop I purchased.  At the end of the day I wasn't willing to eat the cost of returning the laptop, nor the hassle of setting up a new laptop, and so I chose to fix the problem.  In terms of a workaround one can tote around a bluetooth mouse and foregoing use of the touchpad.  Not an ideal workaround when lounging on the couch, but a workaround nonetheless.Bottom line, this plain looking laptop has the features and performance to last for a good long time.  And if you're never in a situation where noise is an issue, or you can workaround/fix the loud touchpad buttons, then it's a good 4 out of 5 star laptop.However, the noise generated by the touchpad buttons should be a deal breaker for folks who would use it in noise sensitive situations.  For instance, I would NOT buy this laptop for a student to take notes in class as the clicking noise will likely draw attention.  I certainly would not use it to take notes in any business meeting.  For people who would use this laptop in noise sensitive situations I'd rate it only 2 out of 5 stars.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "If you are looking for a laptop for daily operation, this should be a good one.", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "RY30YGQNYGJ28", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The computer is capable of handling daily operation. For me, I just use it to surf webs and work on Microsoft office, so it is good enough in terms of its price and performance. It is a pretty solid laptop and so far I don't have problems with it. The temperature of the computer is always cool even I keep it on 24 hrs. Another thing I liked about this laptop is its sound quality. Most laptops have very bad sound quality which the sound is very thin and usually cracks when you turn up the volume too high. Also, the keyboard is another add-on which it gives you a good response when you are tying. However, the screen is not too good in terms of its viewing angle and the color reproduction, but for this price, I am satisfied.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Computer", "Author": "Sandy Cawley", "ReviewID": "R20XA9CTVHQNZO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great computer for school.

You don't find laptops that are 15.6 inches for that price. The only complaint I have is that if I have the volume at the level I prefer for music then there is static that comes out with the music. Anything else I do I have the volume at a lower level and this doesn't happen. So when I listen to music I plug in external speakers which fixes the problem. If I paid a lot for the laptop I would be upset, but for what I paid things like that are expected. I would also like to point out that the operating system is Windows 8. If you haven't used Windows 8 it is completely different than any other windows and it takes time to learn. It is also bigger than the other operating system which means the computer will run slower with it opposed to another operating system. It is set up very much like a tablet operating system. It is weird at first, but once you use to it it is pretty cool. However if I was paying more where I had more of a choice I would choose a laptop with a different operating system. Overall, it functions very well and I can do anything I want in my leisure time and do anything I need for class and work which is why I gave it 4 stars. However if I was to pay anything over $425 I would be pretty upset with my purchase.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth for 400$", "Author": "Arvind", "ReviewID": "R3ELGI1OKM9YLM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i5 4th generation.

There are many issues I would like to state here that have ruined my experience with Dell as a no. 1 computer manufacturer. Remember I bought this laptop on Thanksgiving of 2013, so it is less than2 months and a half old:1. Long time to turn off.2. When you put sleep mode, you are supposed to turn it back on using any button, instead, here you have to press the power button, deleting anything you had open.3. Many times the power button doesn't work, you have to press it real hard.4. A very irksome thing was that many times it would not catch the internet, I had to restart it. Causing problems especially at the beginning of lectures.5. The quality isn't good. The name on the front started to peel off, and the mouse touch pad got stained for some weird reason, even though my hands are always clean when I use it.6. The windows loading got so much slower and slower after just 1 month from using it.7. The touch mouse buttons make a loud noise which is very inconvenient especially if you are in class or in the library. It is very sad that all this happened. I would not recommend Dell anymore not just because I had these problems, but because my brother ordered a Touch Screen Dell for $1100 at the same time I ordered mine and he is not happy with it at all. He is a pharmacist and I am a medical student and Dell did not live up to its' reputation. Our experience with Asus was way better, I still have my old $1500 Asus which is much better and stronger, and I regret leaving it for this Dell which I thought was a good deal, but it turned out I was wrong.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F3ZO422"}}
