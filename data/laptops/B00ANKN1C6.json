{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Quality for the Price", "Author": "Laura", "ReviewID": "R1TS6OHD2XKJ4S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I owned and loved a previous version of the Dell Inspiron 14z.  Unfortunately, it didn't love me back when I got caught in a major thunderstorm and it got soaked through.  When searching for a new computer, I look at other brands and models before settling on another Inspiron 14z.First, the cosmetics.  This laptop is considered an ultrabook -- it's super thin (0.8\") and light (4.12 pounds).  For a Dell, it's remarkably chic and stylish.  I love the Moon Silver finish.The battery life on this computer is fantastic.  I typically get four to five hours of moderately heavy use; if I'm consciously trying to conserve power (turning down display brightness, limiting programs running in the background, etc.) I can routinely get at least six hours.  Compared to other computers I've owned, this is simply great.  The Inspiron 14z also charges quickly, which is one of my favorite things about it.It has an 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 processor (a third-generation Intel processor), which is fantastic for the price.  It also comes with a 500 GB hard drive and 6 GB of RAM.  The computer boots up fast and has no problem running numerous memory-intensive programs at once.  The graphics quality is great, it has an HDMI port, and the webcam works wonderfully.  I definitely give it 5/5 for overall performance.As with most Dell products, it takes some initial tweaking to get the machine working the way you want.  Adjust the sleep/hibernation settings right off the bet to avoid major annoyance (the default is far shorter than I prefer), change the energy-saving preferences, and alter the trackpad settings.  I also uninstalled McAfee and installed Norton instead (personal preference -- I've had major performance problems with McAfee in the past).  It takes a few days to get used to a new trackpad and keyboard, but the transition was easy for me, as I've owned an Inspiron 14z in the past.Overall, I highly recommend this ultrabook.  It looks fabulous, is light and portable, and is lightning fast.  That, combined with the excellent battery life, make this a fantastic product in my book.

We get 2-3 hours of battery life even when we are doing simple, low energy tasks like editing a document. Reality (2-3 hours), Dell's promotional materials (5-8 hours), and their post-purchasing customer service are three entirely different things. We are very unhappy customers.Dell's promotional material says that the Inspiron 14z (6 cell battery) gives \"Power to stay productive - Ultrabooks don't skimp on battery life: with 5 to 8 hours or more of running time they can keep you productive all day\" (http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-14z-5423/pd) and Dell's on-line customer service chat will tell you the \"Inspiron 14z's battery last for up to 7 hrs depending on operating conditions\"We bought the Inspiron because we thought we were getting a reasonable battery life. After we purchased the computer, we contacted Dell about the battery life issue, thinking that the computer was malfunctioning and could be repaired. We even sent it back to them for \"repair.\" Still only got 2-3 hours. We talked further with customer service (many calls over many weeks). Dell's technology staff now say that with a 6 cell battery, you should only expect 2-3 hours and that the marketing material (5-8 hours) refers to time when the computer is asleep. I don't know about you, but I'm not being \"productive all day\" when my computer is asleep.Dell won't stand by their product. They basically told us that we should have known that a six cell battery will only last 2-3 hours and we were out of luck. We will never buy another Dell product. Their customer service is horrible and you can't trust anything they say on their own websites or in their on-line chats.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great when it worked for the first six months - then it died!  Dell would not honor the waranty!", "Author": "Sadiqi", "ReviewID": "R25CEPLE14SYHH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was my third Dell unit and was to replace my aging Dell Inspiron 630m. I had faith in Dell (past tense) Some of the reviews commented on problems.When the unit stopped charging I tried the other charge adapters and same result. I contacted Dell tech support and they were very helpful and said they would ship a new motherboard to  a US address. I was in the Caribbean at the time. Then Dell \"Customer Care\" intervened and stopped the shipment - twice. Allegedly due to a fraudulent postal address. I was advised to contact:Global_Services_Fraud@Dell.comThis I did four or five times and am still waiting for a response! Subsequently contacting either Dell Tech Support or Dell Customer Care I was advised that it is not their problem and I should contact the other!I have spent a great deal of time and effort to attempt to resolve this.I even contact Amazon and was advised that I should have headed the customer reviews, which I might add were not as bad when I purchased the item.To say I am annoyed is an understatement - I have wasted good money on a clearly defective product.I will NOT purchase a Dell computer again! I would also be very cautious  about purchasing a non Amazon brand products from Amazon instead of through Amazon.

The laptop had problems out of the box.  I turned it on, and it worked ok.  But it had no sound and no USB (I assume that's why the camera didn't work either).  I've had a Dell computers and laptops for a long  time (at least 10-15 years), and this is the first time I've had any kind of problem, so it was a real surprise.  It was also one of my big fears because if you call for service, I've always heard that you'll go right to India and spend hours on the phone.  I can handle almost any problem myself, but when a laptop doesn't work out of the box, the easy solution is to send it right back - no phone calls needed.  Thanks to Amazon Prime, this got shipped right back to Amazon.  Thumbs down to Dell on this one, but thumbs up to Amazon.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "outiside plastice pieces fallling off after 4 months, Dell wants $180 to replace it.", "Author": "De D.

I think a lot of the performance suffered in Dell's efforts to cram the computer into that beautiful thin design as they rushed the release of this \"ultrabook\" without it being quite ready. I was so disappointed that I ended up missing my previous much cheaper and older Dell Inspiron T4400. PROS: beautiful design, quiet, fast start-up, thin. CONS: poor battery life, low screen resolution, terrible webcam quality, it loses network connection constantly, sometimes the screen cannot be \"woken\" when it is in sleep mode, and I would've traded the optical drive for an extra USB port (two is not enough). I rated it with three stars because after 13 months of use it still works, which deserves an \"OK\".", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell installs inferior quality Hard Drives", "Author": "Grace \"Grace\"", "ReviewID": "R1YZMS0ZOAG93V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my second Dell laptop in the 12 years i have been using laptops. I also purchased 1 HP and 1 Toshiba during this time. The first Dell Inspirion i bought in 2005 had Hard Drive issues(bad sectors) because of which i had to stop using it after 2 yrs. My Toshiba and HP laptops still work but i just don't use them because of slower processing speed. I have had problems shutting down this Ultrabook since the first day. After 3-4 hrs with customer service rep i thought i had the issue resolved. Then last week the hard drive broke down and the laptop would not start. Luckily it is still in the warranty period so i will not have to pay for the replacement/repair. Apparently Dell does not pay as much attention to the quality of the hard drives it puts in its laptops.

I would have expected a company like Dell to have backed up their computer and been able to see when a computer is a lemon and replace it, but they will not. My mic port went out first they had to flash my BIOS. Then my USB port went out they updated drivers and flashed the BIOS twice and replaced the motherboard. At this time the tech they sent out told me that the computer had internal cracks and was missing screws (this is a refurbished computer I was told was guaranteed). I was very upset and felt like I provided Dell money and was given a product that was defective. The online tech guys just repeated over and over that they will not replace the computer just the parts (the parts keep breaking). Now the computer will not see its own battery charger. I get the same thing we will fix it your computer it will be fine, yes until my warranty runs out and you do not have to deal with me. It has not been fine and they will say that until the warranty runs out. I am stuck with a lemon. I asked them just to give me a credit and I would add money to it and buy a computer from them that was brand new and maybe then I would not have issue and they did not want to help me with that either. I just keep having issue after issue and no wants to see I have a lemon. No one on the chat session will point me to someone that can help me better. Today they offered me a new usb hard drive. This had nothing to do with my issue and they admitted that. They just wanted to shut me up, because I wanted a computer that worked.

We returned it and Amazon promptly sent a replacement.  We had the EXACT SAME PROBLEM with the next machine.  I returned it and later bought her a Mac Air Book, which is a beautiful (but expensive) machine.

If the price is right on this, it is worth getting. Mine came with a Core i5, 6 GB or RAM, and a solid state drive (SSD) in addition to a high capacity standard HDD.I have owned a number of computers for work purposes, but I am not a gear head. This is very light and thin but still includes a DVD drive. I found out after ordering that the SSD does not show up in Windows as a normal hard drive and that the computer only uses it for loading. All of your programs and data go on the standard drive. I can say this computer not only boots faster than other 6GB Windows 8 laptops I've owned, but programs and web pages load a lot faster as well. I don't know enough to say if that's because of the SSD or what, but I like it. This computer is very fast, and the 14 inch screen gives nice extra real estate compared to my last Ultrabook which was 13 inches.The fast web page loads don't seem to have as much to do with the throughput of the internal WiFi (which speedtest.net reported the same as my other computers), but the browsers to not seem to lag when loading pages so everything is very fast.
