{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Usability drawbacks really hurt this laptop", "Author": "Rajan Kapur", "ReviewID": "R33J686Z9MQIVG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've never used a Samsung laptop but had no preconceived notions about the Samsung. I've used IBM/Lenovos, Dells, Sonys, Acers, Toshibas, Gateways - you name it and used most of the non-Apple laptops over the last 20 years in IT. I'm not going into which one I like best, but I can say definitively that this Samsung has the worst track pad & keyboard that I've ever used. As much as I tried, I've had to disable the track pad in order to use the keyboard and carry a wireless mouse with me at all times - WTF! What's the point of having a laptop if I can't use the track pad/keyboard at the same time on the road? I've seen other Samsungs which don't have as much of an issue with the track pad, but almost all users of Samsungs have some complaint about the track pad, keyboard or both. The internal specs are decent with a i5 i5-480M / 2.66 GHz CPU, 4GB RAM (expandable to 8GB), but a below average Hard Drive (320 GB) and poor-to-mid battery life make this a laptop I would not recommend to others. In a crowded and intensely competitive mid-range laptop space, I can't see how the Samsung line will survive if it can't even master the most basic of laptop features (keyboard/track pad).", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Laptop", "Author": "Cathy Trinh", "ReviewID": "R1RNL3SUFR6C5W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As I was entering my first year of college, I knew that having a laptop would be much more handy and more convenient for a college student. I was kind of on a budget and the macbook was out of the question. I didn't want anything too big, since I bring this with me to school sometimes. As I was browsing around looking for the perfect size laptop, I cam across this one - the Samsung SF310. It has a unique shape to it. Although the screen may be a little bit small, it's still manageable. The laptop is not too heavy and it's a very compact size. Would I recommend this to first time laptop owners? Yes.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Budget laptop, budget performance", "Author": "Shadi Safadi", "ReviewID": "R1S5G2V5LT6ENK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is no over-achieving laptop. It's good, but not great. Biggest downfall is the screen, which has a very restricted viewing angle. If you're anything but dead-straight, it's not sharp.Battery performance is about 2 hours on a full charge, even after upgrading to SSD drive.Touchpad is very finicky, forced to use a mouse.The CD drive seems to open by itself if you're holding the laptop from the side and your hand presses against it (without touching the eject button).It's a little heavy. Sound from the speakers is low.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop!&deal;/price", "Author": "David J.

But there are OH SO MANY REASONS NOT TO BUY THIS COMPUTER.  WASTE OF MONEY!  NIGHTMARE!  Yes, all type disappears for no reason ALL THE TIME. Also, however, battery life:  they told me 7 hours.  Well, not really,  but anyway, for however long (I think 5 at best) -- when it gets down to the last 7%, a dialog box starts FLASHING ON YOUR SCREEN \"BATTERY LOW 7%\"  -- you plug the cord in, but THE FLASHING DOESNT STOP IT JUST KEEPS FLASHING AND YOU CANT DO ANYTHING TILL IT CHARGES.  PLUS, the windows are stored down on your toolbar, but loads of times you just can't pull them up -- it's a tease, they start to come up, but disappear.  The cursor skips, the mousepad is jumpy, you could kill yourself trying to write a paragraph.  just in this review I lost the type twice (i have control z at the ready all the time).
