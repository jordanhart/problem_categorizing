The screen is big and bright and you're up and running out of the box in just a few minutes. There's only 1 major problem for me and that's the touchpad. I am a heavy Adobe Photoshop user and I simply cannot hold down the left mouse button and use the touchpad. It's very stiff. I've tried changing every setting, but it's not a setting issue. It's simply hard to depress and make selections. I purchased a Bamboo touch for $35 at Best Buy and it is just too awkward to use. The salesperson at Sam's told me he didn't like the touchpad and I read other reviews that said the same thing, but I couldn't imagine a touchpad would be a make or break item for such a nice laptop - but it is. So, this is not going to be the computer for me. Otherwise it is just great.", "Date": "November 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Fast and portable", "Author": "Matthew Koonce", "ReviewID": "R2N8W6RJENEGMT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop has all the components necessary to replace most desktop systems. It has a decent graphics chip for games and an integrated graphics chip for portable low power use. The blu-ray drive is a nice addition for the big, crisp screen. The battery under regular use last 2-3 hours, I'm sure if regular use was running word, no music playing, and not on wifi it would last the 6-7 hp advertises. Overall for a powerful system on the go, it works great.", "Date": "May 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP DV7 Laptop PC", "Author": "Mikeyman", "ReviewID": "R2OG8CNBI99RN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer replaced a 10 year old Dell desktop system and I couldn't be happier with it.  It's the heart of a wireless system.  Unfortunately, I had a hard-drive failure that occurred just after the warranty expired so I had to pay to have it repaired.  I sent the unit back to HP.  Their customer service department did an excellent job of instructing me on how to send the unit back and even sent a prepaid box for that purpose.  I wasn't happy about the expense but it happens but HP made the experience minimally painful.  As for it's performance, it's exceeded my expectations and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.", "Date": "December 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0046WB3UY"}}
