It comes with DVD and touch screen. It is a bit slow and I'm not sure if it accept 3d dads or not . I like it very much and it works for me. I had to start all over again with the window 8 and frankly I don't like some of its apps like Netflex. so I uninstalled the app and just use a short cut of it. If I had to decide to buy it again I would have bought this item again. Since I use it mostely for the media, I'm not that much concern about the slowness of it. The memory is adequate however if I knew how I would have increased it to the max. I have not yet figured out how t0 Video /call with it but I'll try to learn. BUT you need to know that it is not Google friendly and I have not been able to link my apps from Google to this laptop.", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dead in under a year", "Author": "KenSea", "ReviewID": "R1DWB32QNUG78Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I gave this a 2, because when it worked, I loved this machine.  Cute, sleek, DVD drive...but it jammed up a few months after I bought it & Geek Squad counseled me to pull battery.  This became habitual, like a smart phone when you're near your trade-in date!  Then pulling the battery no longer worked, and they told me to hold the power button while battery was out (to drain power reserves), this worked for a while.  Then on the first day of college, I tried to start up the computer & it was completely frozen on the start screen.  Gave to geek squad & was told I would lose everything on the hard drive because they had to sweep & completely reinstall the Windows 8 OS.  Waited 10 days for Toshiba to send me the recovery J-drive (and charged me $28 for it).  Computer crashed 5 days later, lost all my assignments for school.  They had to send it out for service & they had to replace the hard drive.  Two weeks later I get it back and it still doesn't work.  Geeks tried for 2 hours to reinstall OS & finally junked it and got me a refund to buy a new computer.  Got 9.5 months of use out of this computer.  (FYI, after 30 days Toshiba will NOT junk out your computer and give you another one EVER, they will just fix it and fix it!  Best Buy took one for the team!)", "Date": "September 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Touch screen is a pleasure to use", "Author": "ken Schick", "ReviewID": "R1L6DVMDYPMSA5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The computer itself is excellent!

In reality, it is too heavy to be used as a tablet and with a full keyboard you don't need touch screen. I have had it over a year and find that I hardly use the touch screen.In addition, the Windows 8 interface is rather annoying and I prefer using the Desktop interface over Windows 8 tile apps.  I am annoyed when it accidentally switches between interfaces.Updates and programs also seem to run slower over time too. I often get interruptions, slow downs and freezes.I have had Toshiba net book for years before and liked it for reliability, durability, and simple use. One thing I do like about this laptop is the wide screen for watching videos. I have only used the DVD once and don't think it's necessary to have. Almost any data can be downloaded now or be transferred with USB drive. CDs and DVDs are old school now.Overall I would not recommend this laptop or others with touch screen features or Windows 8 for general computing with a keyboard. Use Windows 7 if available. Get a simple laptop and save from unnecessary features.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing laptop", "Author": "CBB462", "ReviewID": "R1OGSEF72OXXKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "im loving this laptop in fact im writing this review on it right now.

Doubroff", "ReviewID": "R1ZLLGWLOIX2F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I resisted getting a laptop to replace my PC, but I have learned to eat my words! The touchscreen has specifically helped me get over the frustration I had felt in the past when using a mouse pad to navigate around, and the keyboard action is set right for a person who can type fast. I'm using an external drive for any large files that I need stored.  I find the system very flexible and fast.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect", "Author": "Paul Tyndale", "ReviewID": "R26N79AAT07EV6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly I did not buy this laptop from amazon, my unit was purchased at best buy in atlanta. I don't think it slow it runs quit well actually. It doesn't over heat or make loud fan noises. Th screen is crystal clear and most of my Windows 7 programs work well or better in windows 8 environment.However the one problem i am having is when i watch youtube or start to use the touch screen too often, its as if all 10 points on the touch screen are appearing on the screen simultaneously its as if the 10 points are just appearing on random prts of the screen as if i had all 10 fingers on it but im not touching the screen and it does this on its own only when youtubing or using heavy adobe flash player videos. However restarting the video usually fixes issue. If all else fails a reboot is last option and always works (for now) I hope MS sends out some good updates soon for the touch screen. And one more thing: you have to tap the keys on the keyboard just a slight bit harder than other laptops but not noticeably harder.In conclusion the machine performs as you would expect a new unit would (for me anyway) apart from the touchscreen going haywire once in a while i love his laptop.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great choice", "Author": "Dario Beraldo", "ReviewID": "R1XWNZNURX6544", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price and qualityWindows 8 is fantastic and touch pad is greatLove it the functionality and the appearance", "Date": "May 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "EXCELLENT", "Author": "Laura Reyes Jp \"LAURA REYES PINO\"", "ReviewID": "R3DTVVVCDM8Q45", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I LOVE THE TOSHIBA LAPTOP JUST SEEMS A LITTLE SLOW BUT EXCELLENTI LOVE THE TOSHIBA LAPTOP JUST SEEMS A LITTLE SLOW BUT EXCELLENT", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just as described", "Author": "HalfPint3305", "ReviewID": "R33B32TCI0MY2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The product was just as described.

Totally worth it. I'm upgrading from an old Toshiba Satellite from 2009 and honestly this laptop isn't all that bad. It took me maybe two hours to get used to Windows 8, although I'm sure there's some things I haven't learned yet. I only use the touchscreen when I'm on the start screen, but it's still a cool feature. The keypad and keyboard is very responsive, it's fast, it's quiet and eco-friendly. I honestly haven't dealt with any big glitches. It's running very smooth for me. However, every now and then when I'm on a page such as Chrome, I'll barely swipe the keypad and it'll switch over to like iTunes. That's the only real issue I've dealt with. I've only had this laptop for a day so I haven't been able to really test out the battery life. I'll try and update this review in about a month.Update (October 8, 2013):So, I've this laptop for2 months and it still works perfectly! My computer boots up in less than 5 seconds, everything is still smooth, my laptop is still quiet. I figured out reason why it swiped from like Chrome to iTunes and I just went to settings and fixed that issue. The battery still lasts a good while; I'm rarely on the Start screen but when I am I don't ever have any problems. Everything still works perfectly.

(My 3 year old $329.00 Asus was way faster) I paid $625. for it about 9 months ago and went with it because at the time that was a super deal on the unit.  I was disapointed with the machine but still really liked the touch screen and figured I needed to get more comfortable with Windows 8.I sucked it up and dealt with the issues (except on the weekends when I could bring my work issued laptop home) because I really did like the touch screen and it didn't freeze all that often using Word, Excel, which was what I really bought it for...Anyway, then I dropped it, and now I understand why the performance was so bad.  I shattered the screen.  I can find new screens all day long for $50-$60 the digitizer, the component that makes a touch screen touch sensitive, is $400.00.  That's just the cost of the parts, I'm willing to fix it myself. If the bling is that expensive, they couldn't have that great a quality on the 'go' parts!  That's like buying a car for $24,000 driving over something you shouldn't flattening, the tire and finding out the new tire will cost $16,000.  Who would have expected that.  I'll never buy another Toshiba product again.  I'm going back to Asus, which, besides being a more reliable machine is also more durable. :)  I'm not saying that somebody should fix my computer for me...it was my accident, but the parts ought to be reasonable.  IF you buy it anyway.  GET THE WARRANTY and then make them fix the glitches too! :)", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nightmare", "Author": "Red98c5", "ReviewID": "R9Q7QAFGDQYIJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "As a college professor who teaches online, I have had many, many laptops.  My last Toshiba was a dream.  This computer is Satan.  The screen goes from huge to tiny on its own.  You are typing and it jumps to a totally different screen.  Sometimes when you are typing, it freezes.  Sometimes it puts annoying blue boxes around everything.  I have never, ever had a computer this bad.

This is by far the worst one I have ever used.  For a newer computer, it is dirt slow.  Booting from powering on takes a good 5-10 minutes for it to fully come up.  Bringing the computer out of sleep mode doesn't fare much better.  For some strange reason, the wifi shuts down when coming out of sleep mode, and takes 3-4 minutes before it will reconnect.  The Windows 8.1 upgrade did not make anything better or worse.I blame myself because I got sucked into the touch screen (which I never use).
