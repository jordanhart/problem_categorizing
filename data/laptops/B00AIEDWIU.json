This laptop is fast and screen is nice.  Speakers are just awful.  I don't expect concert hall quality, of course, but these are tinny and very poor.  Toshiba Customer service suggests getting external speakers.  I think they should be embarrassed to recommend that solution.This our family's third and LAST Toshiba laptop.", "Date": "February 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed with laptop and Toshiba customer service.", "Author": "Deanna Decker", "ReviewID": "R2UR76XUTRPLQU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am very upset with this product and Toshiba customer service. Problems started with a few keys not working and the F key seemingly stuck and progressed to no keys working whatsoever. Toshiba wants $10.55 and $60 labor to repair something that is covered under warranty. I asked for the laptop to be returned to me and I will have someone local repair it. I have a Samsung laptop that has given me no problems at all and I'll be going with Samsung in the future.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel\u00ae CoreTM i3-2328M Processor @ 2.2 GHz / 8GB DDR3 Memory / 500GB HDD (5400rpm, Serial ATA)\n15.6\" widescreen HD TruBrite\u00ae LED Backlit display (Resolution: 1366x768 (HD), 16:9 aspect ratio, Supports 720p content) /  Plays and burns CDs and DVDs /\nBuilt-in webcam and microphone / Memory card reader / 1 USB 3.0; 2 USB 2.0; 1 Ethernet; 1 HDMI; 1 VGA 15-pin D-sub\nWi-Fi\u00ae Wireless networking (802.11b/g/n) / Built-in microphone, Headphone jack (stereo), Standard stereo speakers, TOSHIBA Audio Enhancement\nMicrosoft\u00ae Windows\u00ae 8 / Fusion\u00ae Finish in Mercury Silver / Energy Star Qualified", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite\u00ae C855-S5355 Laptop with 15.6\" Screen - 2nd Gen Intel\u00ae CoreTM i3 Processor - 8GB Memory - 500GB Hard Drive - Windows 8", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41l81f88s2L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AIEDWIU"}}
