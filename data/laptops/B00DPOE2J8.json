{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very nice ultrabook", "Author": "Dan S", "ReviewID": "R32F2QJWY7GGUP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually purchased my Dell XPS 12 directly from Dell, but wanted to share on Amazon which is where I buy most of my electronics my opinion on the machine.This is my second ultrabook, but I am really impressed. I love my previous ultrabook, but I really love the keyboard on the dell xps 12. It is has the nicest touch of any laptop keyboard I've ever used. The gesture touchpad is very nice and the convertible touchscreen is very sweet.I'm mainly a laptop user that likes to have a tablet and this totally fits the bill for me. I've passed my Asus Zenbook prime 13.3 and transformer prime 10.1 table down to my partner in exchange for this tablet and I am very happy with it.It has taken a little bit to get used to Windows 8, but as I get used to it, I really appreciate what the XPS has to offer more and more. I'm a web application developer. I've loaded Adobe Creative Suites to my XPS in addition to Visual Studio 2010, Office Professional, SQL Server 2008 R2 and ColdFusion 10 to support my development and I'm able to run all of them with out an issue when I'm doing work on my personal laptop; however, I still get to switch to a tablet and the Windows 8 tiles to check in on facebook or twitter,This laptop is a great balance between size, power and features. The USB 3.0 ports are fantastic. I've added a USB 3.0 docking station and the laptop in combination with the docking station has no issue supporting dual 22\" HD displays for heavy duty coding, testing and debugging.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great and powerful ultrabook", "Author": "agm", "ReviewID": "RFHAIYKTTNHR4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very impressed with the quality of this ultrabook. It even competes with my \"full notebook\" a Lenovo Thinkpad W520. I have used Lightroom and Photoshop for editing images from the Nikon D600 (24 megapixel c\u00e1mera with 20-30 MB RAW files), and it works at least as fast as my Thinkpad. The screen gamut 53% of AdobeRGB and only 71% sRGB (vs the Thinkpad which is 97% AdobeRGB), but in terms of performance is as fast, and sometimes I find it even faster. So I'm very happy, making it a capable machine to take for trips and edit photos on location without needing necessarily to take the \"Monster\" :PIn Windows it's performance: Processor (mine it's a refurbished with i7-3687U @ 2.10) = 7.2, Memory 8 Gb = 7.5, Graphics (intel) = 5.4, Gaming 6.4, Primary hard disc (SSD 256) = 8.1 (vs on the Thnikpad to which I added a Samsung 512 SSD, just as a reference: 7.4, 7.6, 5.8, 6.4, 8.1)I haven't used it much as a tablet, I bypass Metro and added a Start button with Classic Shell freeware program, but  the touch screen feels responsive, and the flip screen mechanism feels solid.It's a pitty it doesn't have more USB ports, an SD reader and even an ethernet port... but those aren't showstoppers.The keyboard is nice, a liiiitle more travel would have been better, but for the size its pretty good, the trackpad and mainly the trackpad buttons are not good, having it's surface part of the trackpad, sometimes you want to clic and you end moving the cursor and clicking other thing. Besides the software doesn't allow customizing tapping with 2 and 3 finger which I have done for years on linux, having 2 finger clic as middle button (to close tabs, open links on new tabs and closing windows) and 3 finger clic set to right clic/menu. And as the trackpad is not good, I end up using a USB mouse whenever I'm not typing on my lap, so ONLY one USB port left :(... so a USB hub is a must.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Limited Warranty\nDELL 469-4078\nDell XPS 469-4078 12.5 Convertible Multi-touch Screen Ultrabook/Tablet Intel Core i7-3537U 2GHz 8GB DDR3 256GB SSD Intel HD Graphics 4000 Windows 8", "Name": "Dell XPS 469-4078 12.5 Convertible Multi-touch Screen Ultrabook/Tablet Intel Core i7-3537U 2GHz 8GB DDR3 256GB SSD Intel HD Graphics 4000 Windows 8", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41nkpoidY5L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DPOE2J8"}}
