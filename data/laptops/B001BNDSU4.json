I have had it for two months now and have only noticed one quirk and I believe that to be software related. As for the first negative review I am somewhat surprised as mine came with the reinstall DVD and the option of either having Vista 64 or 32 bit. There are some things on the partition but it is just the usual bloatware that you get on most retail PCs. I just formatted over it and use the extra HDD space. The only thing I wanted from it was the Lableflash software and you can easily get that online at various locations for free. All in all this is a great laptop with tons of features. One of my favorite things is that it has two HDD bays and unlike many other manufactures which would fill both with smaller drives to total the 320 gigs Gateway left the one slot empty for those who would wish to upgrade. From everything that I read they have done the same things for their processor and graphics card. Both can be removed and replaced. That was my one concern when purchasing this Laptop was the underpowered processor. However again that is easily replaced according to everything I read. In the end this is a highly upgradable laptop with a sweet case design and cost $800 less than the equivalent HP or Dell. I have not dealt with customer service but then again I am a geek and usually do all the repairs myself any way.P.S. Just for those that are curious about the HDMI and whether you can run the sound through it, yes you can. That was one of the question I could not find answered online.", "Date": "October 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop!", "Author": "James C.

I have not had encounters with Gateway customer support, but the laptop itself it great.  Just be careful where you buy it from.  I purchased mine from Bestbuy and had the opportunity to return it for any reason within 2 weeks.  I highly recommend this laptop for anyone that plays games or just wants to use it for basic computing.I purchased this laptop about a month ago.  My husband and I had looked around for a year or so before making our purchase.  When we saw this particular one, we were suprised at the price.  We paid $749 for it, and could not be happier.  You cannot get another laptop that even slightly compares to the spec's this one has in its price range.  It has run everything at exeptionally high frame rates.The battery life is not wonderful, but we have the cable and an adapter for our vehicle.  So that problem does not concern us.  It also gets a little hot, but I've not run across a laptop that doesn't.  Just make sure you have a cooling pad to prevent your lap from burning.", "Date": "October 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love this Laptop", "Author": "callyico", "ReviewID": "R2QWNQRGGSX7CK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this laptop since it first came out in 2008 and have always loved it. I am still using it and it is still going strong. It is rather large and heavy to call it a laptop though! I had to buy a 22\" laptop bag to carry it. I use this more like a desktop for this reason but it is great to take when traveling. The graphics and speed are still up to date even for the newer 3D games coming out and I use it for movies as well. The HDMI connection is great as well as all of it's other connections. (to many to list - sorry) It even has laser labeling for DVD/CD. I bought this so it would stay ahead of anything new coming and it is still in the running with the newer machines coming out. Since you can only buy this used and if you are looking for lots of multimedia power/gaming power you get a lot of bang for your bucks buying this one which used to cost close to $2,000.00. Can run 32bit or 64bit and so much more.

I had a HP pavilion (dv7 I recommend you don't but that one) and it's screen burnt out and HP was trying to charged me hundreds to get it fixed.

I brought my computer from Best Buy on sale for like $1000+ and it was well worth it. It really is a good computer. I'm a Sims 2 and 3 fanatic and out of all of the 4 laptops I've had this was the only one I actually like playing the game on and for any others.Those people complain over the littlest things and HEY IF YOU HAVE GATEWAY FX AND YOU DON'T WANT IT LET ME KNOW I'll take it off your hands for free and give you my two broke ones haha ;)If you want something that lasts I suggest you buy this computer, get some BIGGER hard drives and call it a day ^.^", "Date": "March 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect Win7/Linux Dual Boot Machine", "Author": "Bearcat.14", "ReviewID": "R3QX27WWOED2J7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me preface: I need windows for my gaming (dx10 and such), but need linux for my development (bash, gnu c, python, java).With the dual HDD slots this was the perfect candidate for my Windows 7 and Ubuntu 10 dual boot machine.With a price tag under $900 and the 8800GTS w/ 512MB dedicated it is the most affordable gaming laptop on the market.Sure, it didn't run Crysis at MAX settings with the DEFAULT clocking.But NVIDIA has a free tool to overclock the video card (safely) and with a few tweaks I running Crysis on full specs EASY.My setup get a 6.0 Windows 7 Experience Index which is limited by the RAM only.Next limiting factor is 6.6 which is the Nvidia 8800M GTS.My hard drive upgrade is rating at a 7.8 (Intel X25-M G2 80GB for win7, 320gb 7200rpm scorpio black for linux), YEAH ITS CRAZY!Windows 7 install is a breeze, windows update gets EVERYTHING automatically, even graphics.Ubuntu 10.10 is just as easy and might be the fastest OS I have ever seen (gets all drivers all, even graphics).Overall, this thing is fast, quiet, cool, powerful, and doesn't leave a 4 digit withdrawal on your bank account.Grab yourself one while you still can!", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "BEWARE", "Author": "S.

There are some down sides to it, but overall, if you care for it, it's a really good computer. The most inconvenient thing is probably the weight. This is a large (17\" screen), and heavy computer for a laptop. It is portable, but portability is limited by its weight. It can overheat very quickly, so this is not a computer you want to have sitting on your bed. Purchase an inexpensive laptop pad and there is no problem with overheating. Finally, if you leave this computer plugged in for extended periods, you can kill the battery (this is the case with pretty much any rechargeable battery). If you don't plan on carrying the computer back and forth a lot, you keep the computer on a solid surface so air can flow freely under and around it, and you don't leave it constantly plugged into the wall, this computer will last you for years. Just remembered one more negative, the color of the keys make it very difficult to see in low light. I can type by touch, so it's not a huge problem for me, but if you need to see the keys, it can be an issue.Some of the really good things about this computer is the processing speed. This is designed as a gaming computer, so it can render graphics very well and very quickly. This translates into not only a good gaming environment, but an excellent platform for watching movies. The speakers are very loud compared to other laptops I have owned, and paired with the 17\" screen, allow for an very good movie watching experience via DVD or over the internet. There is plenty of processor speed to multi task and have a movie playing in the background while you do other things (like surf the web, type a paper, etc.).One of my kids got to my computer and pulled most of the keys out, and the keys on this computer are not easy to replace once removed (but they are very difficult to remove in the first place). Along with that and the battery being practically dead, I figure it would cost less to just buy another one and switch the hard drive than it would be to repair the one I have, so I'm looking into purchasing a new laptop now.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wasn't worth the price then or now", "Author": "Amie M. Standal", "ReviewID": "R2T4JW6GWC1CMC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Save your money.  Don't buy this laptop.  It works well at first, but then begins locking up randomly.  As others have stated running any game even on minimum graphics causes it to overheat to the point of burning you when you touch it to turn it off, and it overheats QUICKLY!  Mine is on one of the industries leading cooling units, because Gateway convinced me that my problem was an inadequate cooling unit, not an inadequate CPU.  And if you're like me and beyond frustrated when you finally call customer service, only to get someone who's accent is so thick you honestly can not understand a word they say, then you may find problems with their tech support as well.

I'm not sure where to start. I paid over 400.00 for the computer and thought I got a real bargain and boy was I wrong. Should have known there was a catch. We had it only a few days and it quit working. Taking the sellers word on the condition, I paid to have it looked at and told the tech what I had been told. He thought \"a graphics card.\" The seller knew that it was the motherboard with the graphics card integrated in it because when I told the seller what the tech said, he was very anxious to hear \"graphics card\" and said, really? The tech ran diagnostics and said it was(Of course it wasn't working, neither was the motherboard), but he didn't have one. I paid to have it shipped to Gateway dealer for repair. I'm starting to lose money at this point with shipping and paying for first tech. Gateway dealer said it's the motherboard with integrated graphics card. \"They are obsolete and you can't buy new or refurbished.\" I paid over 100.00 to that tech up front only to have it shipped back 3 weeks later not repaired. I sent it off again to a tech in Florida and paid 101.00. They said they'd be able to help. More shipping cost, it came back un-fixable. It now has a place on a shelf and won't even turn on. Wow....a few days and several hundred dollars. Told the seller and he was rude, didn't want to do anything.
