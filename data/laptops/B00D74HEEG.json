{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great gaming laptop for the price", "Author": "Ehsan", "ReviewID": "R1GYNR2SPB56IH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think it's a great buy for the price. I would describe it by this list:Advantages:-High performance graphical card, runs high graphic new games-Adequate ventilation & heat discharge-Battery lasts for 1:30-2:30 hours, has the ability to use extra batteriesDisadvantages:-Short range of wi-fi (can fix with buying an external usb wi-fi)-Shiny display (Not my favorite)-Comes with Windows 8 without having a solid state hard drive. This slowed down my browsing. I had disk usage on 100% accompanied by slow running windows. But fixed it by manually setting the virtual memory page file limits.I'm like the laptop so far. It's been a month now.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D74HEEG"}}
