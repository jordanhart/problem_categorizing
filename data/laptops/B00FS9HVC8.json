{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works well better than expected", "Author": "Ihaab Mohamed", "ReviewID": "R3OIOK83P97U1P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "purchased this after a lot of research. tested it for three days now. machine is very nice and light. keys have a nice crisp feel to the punch with no flexing. touch screen works well (need to get used to some of the changes as i am transitioning from Win 7) would have wished a back lit keyboard, but then again I knew this one did not have it.Battery life seems good. i have been using it on batter now for 2 hours. used internet, Corel draw, virtual DJ and still have about 2 hours battery life left.Laptops powers up in less than a minute. maybe this will change later but it is pretty good.Laptop is nice and light but still feels strong to the hand. hinge feels firm with a little snap when u close it.another important part for a portable laptop is also to have a small power brick. i have not seen any review that touched on this, so to help others here it is. This laptop's power brick is just 1.5 X 3.5 X 1 inch and weighs less than 150g (5.2 Oz)Cant find any negativesAs for Windows 8.1 i wish the program menu was as in Win 7 as i have to now go into search type and then find my programs. if there is a shorter way i still have not found it.About me: this is my forth laptop. had 2 Lenovos and this is my second Acer. I tend to research a lot before buying and in general use a machine more than 4 years. i also advise my friends on bests options to buy for their own needs. i also am comfortable removing the machine and doing upgrades myself.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "PC works great... but touchpad is too large and gets in the way", "Author": "Brooke Bickelhaupt", "ReviewID": "R9ZE7X8ZY5BRA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This PC is performing as expected.  Its fast and functional.  And contrary to popular opinion, I don't find Windows 8 to be awful (there's definitely a learning curve associated with it).My only complaint thus far is that the touchpad is entirely too large.  As such, the \"pad\" of my left hand is routinely resting on the touchpad, which really screws things up when I'm trying to use the touchpad with my right hand or if I'm trying to utilize the touchscreen.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Work horse for good price.", "Author": "Mr Philip Y Wu", "ReviewID": "RDK65PHVXTBVD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good I5 in its class.

I was looking for a multi-touch laptop that could be used for light gaming, mild graphics work and hours of multi-media entertainment. The battery life is good for 15.6 inch screened laptop lasting past 4 hours for web surfing. I did not realize this unit did not come with an optical drive which is unusual for a laptop this size and there is a cover plate where one would be located. Fortunately I had a compact external DVD writer which worked perfectly for loading additional software.

Still looking for stuff to share but it is worth it I guess.", "Author": "Julius", "ReviewID": "R3EVS1H4SWKX6F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really wanted a backlit keyboard and an optical drive but could not find any deal under 550 with those specs (plus at least the i5) so I settled with this. Great specs.The touchpad and buttons are a pain to use. I am about to contact acer if I have a dysfunctional one (hope not) but all is good.Touchscreen is good but I needed to buy a screen protector just so I don't regret. I got the 3 year canopy, I do not know if it is legit but...Keyboard, surprisingly is good. I thought I would be getting the nasty one.Battery life has been okay so far.Some hiccups here and there - I do not know if it is the laptop or the OS. The OS seems to be slow launching apps I guess. The laptop probably bec it just woke up from a sleep (?) or I have too much going on but it's okay. I am able to do more with this than a 1 Ghz processor laptop I previously had.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent Price", "Author": "Bill Jones", "ReviewID": "R1GDYCANTJPIQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My overall experience so far has been pretty good, I like the design of the laptop, and the performance is pretty good for the price range. I gave this a 4 out of 5 and didn't drop the rating for most of my CONS because I can understand sometimes you have a good apple and a bad apple, this is a great deal and worked fairly well up until a week ago. I just got the time to do the review, if this is going to be for a student, business professional, or gaming enthusiast I would certainly recommend this laptop.Bluetooth worked with my S5, it's added some extra value for portability in my opinion. If I was to go back in time and rethink this purchase I would have still made the purchase.Pros:I like the keyboard as it's pretty responsive for my needs.Touch Screen - don't use it very much but it's nice to have just in caseSpecs - The i5 seems to get sluggish at times during multi-tasking (Netbeans, Notepad++, Visual Studio 2010) but it rebounds nicely when the turbo boost kicks in.Intel HD 4400 Graphics - I didn't buy this device to play games on, however it is very nice to play games on the go, I play Tera Online and various other games on Steam. This laptop performed over my expectations, I'm able to do the Nexus without much difference from my desktop PC which is an Alienware, mind you the graphics are not as superb but certainly playable which added more value to my purchase.Cons:Internet Connectivity - I don't know if this is an inherited issue but connection drops frequently and I am going to contact Acer about thisSound - The built in Realtek Sound Device is constantly being stuck on headphone input", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Touchpad not working properly.", "Author": "James Alexander", "ReviewID": "R2F5CUTTJ4CR5I", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I understand that this is a touch screen laptop.
