{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WARNING: Product received may differ. Otherwise, a great laptop.", "Author": "veritas.cubed", "ReviewID": "R1P3GLVW72F5QR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me get this nagging thing out of the way: I bought this from Amazon last week, and IMMEDIATELY felt VERY disappointed. Before I placed the order, I spoke with Amazon chat to confirm that \"CineCrystal\" display on this product's page meant a glossy screen. The sales rep CONFIRMED it does, and it will, as it states on the page. Come 3 days later, after I look around and find NO OTHER gaming laptop has it, I pull the trigger. I open the Amazon box to see the Acer laptop... and *sigh* The side label said \"ComfyView\"-- Their panels that have the anti-glare matte coating.Yes, matte screens are ideal for outside use and all, as there is little to no glare, compared to glossy screens, but this is a portable Blu-ray and gaming laptop for hanging with friends in dimly lit rooms-- I WANTED a glossy screen, as it still advertises on this page. I prefer glossy because they have, IMO, a sharper image, better contrast and colors that give off... more of a \"pop\", so to speak. I bought this almost exlcusively for the MMORPG on PC, \"Tera: Rising\", which has very vibrant colors, and I remember playing on 2 different 1080p (both TN panels, so don't bring up the \"it's a different panel arguement) screens, one with and one without gloss, and the glossy one looked MUCH better! Regardless, if you're on the hunt for a glossy screen as I am, the matte screen does still look nice, and I truly mean it when I say Acer has THE BEST looking laptops. It's a brushed aluminum finish all around, and it looks... beautiful! Just be aware if you buy from Amazon, you MAY receive a product that differs from the description. I read a review on Newegg from a confirmed purchase they received a glossy screen, so I'm REALLY contemplating if I should go through hassle to return and buy from Newegg only for that reason.Now onto the goods: The chicklet keyboard feels great when typing, and although not particularly ideal for gaming, gets the job done. Be aware that these keys are really sensitive, so pressing on them too hard may recess them in a stuck position-- My friend just called asking why when he presses the 'E' key n Windows 8, the \"My Computer\" pops up. Well, he just needed to tap the Windows key a bit, and that fixed it; Windows key + E is a shortcut to My Computer.The screen is nice. The viewing angles are like a typical TN: From side to side, you will notice a diminishing effect, but not a lot. Fro mtop to bottom, however, you will absolutely notice that weird loss of color, so position yourself right on this laptop when viewing movies for the best quality. Colors look well, resolution sharp and text is very nice to read.Gaming. The GTX 760 is a good lower mid range mobile class card, where most people recommend it for 1600 x 900 (HD+) gaming, and not 1920 x 1080 (FHD) if you want to \"max\" out games, or play on high quality settings. Despite those reviews, and benchmarks that say it's within a margin of error in comparison to the GTX 750M (The Acer Aspire V3-772G 9829 being equipped with that, and about $200 less, but no BD drive and 4GB less of RAM), it games fine at 1080p. I HIGHLY recommend downloading the latest drivers from GeForce's website, and leave the check mark to download and install \"GeForce Experience\"-- It's the difference between playable and non-playable, and will save you LOADS of time! Here are some rough estiamtes in some games at certain settings, as observed through FRAPS running as an FPS marker (I did not set a benchmark, these are what I recall seeing it stable out around; take this as an expectation of sorts):Tera: Rising -- 1080p, MAXED OUT (All settings at 6/6, or their maximum equivalent): It ranged from 35-38 FPS questing, and dipping A LOT, going from 8-15 FPS in Corsair's Stronghold PvP Battleground. If you're familiar with this game, you know this is not uncommon, as even my desktop equipped with a 780 dips into the 20's, as this game has not gotten a lot of love for optimization.League of Legends -- 1080p, EVERYTHING MAXED: Observed over 70 FPS, and maybe a low of 55 at times, but VERY smooth.Far Cry 3-- 1080p, HIGH settings (3rd lowest; VERY HIGH and ULTRA are after, so this is 3/5, so to speak) with no filters or AA, and HDAO: About 25-29 FPS roaming around, and a little higher riding a jet ski. Still looks nice with the pixel density of 1080p on a 17.3\" screen.Guild Wars 2 -- 1080p, MAXED OUT, with NO Supersampling (Disabled): About 38-42 FPS questing.Metro Last Light -- 1080p, NORMAL, Advanced PhysX OFF, SSAA OFF, Tessellation NORMAL, 16x AF: About 35-39 FPS. Playable. I manually adjusted settings for a bit, having it on high with no filters, and where it did hover at 40 or so FPS, there were plenty of areas with just the AI talking it would TANK to like 12-15 FPS for no reason. This is the game GeForce Experience definitely helped out, and why I'd recommend you install for your convenience when you update your graphics driver.Crysis 3 -- This one I have installed, but did not yet try out. I'm listing off what GeForce Experience recommends I set my settings to for the best experience: 1600 x 900 (HD+; lower resolution than the default 1080p), 1x AF, and ALL settings LOW. Yeah, this won't run Crysis maxed out, like at all.The Blu-ray drive is nice; plays all my Blu-rays, even ones I backed up that my niece loves to throw around just fine-- I used ArcSoft Total Media Theatre 6 I have a license for as opposed to the default Blu-ray media. If it ain't broke... This is a Blu-ray reader/ DVD burner. You can however create ISOs out of Blu-ray for mounting on a virtual drive, so that's a plus.All in all, my few days with it doing light benchmarking and all has been nice. I would recommend either switching out the 5400 RPM drive with a 7200 RPM one (~$88 off of eBay for 1TB), or use an SSD for boot (there is a second hard drive bay that does not come occupied, for future expansion), as this laptop boots a little slower than I'm used to. I'll see if this matte screen can win me over, but other than that one big gripe, I feel the rest of the parts are great for gaming on the go, albeit at medium to high settings.", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Performance/Great Price", "Author": "Clarence Kinzalow", "ReviewID": "R3BILBJA7JYLUD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Since the Samsung NC-10 netbook I purchased about 4-5 years ago was struggling to perform even the most basic tasks, I decided a new laptop was in order.I compared quite a few makes and models before deciding on the Aspire, which provided one of the best feature-to-cost ratios of the lot. I've had it for around 2 months now and I'm pretty satisfied with my purchase.PRO:-Screen size. Granted I upgraded from a 10.2\" 1024x600 display to this one, but having a 17.3\", full HD monitor on a laptop is pretty nice. Everything is super sharp and great for movies, games, photo-editing, and various graphics-related tasks.-RAM. 12GB? Is this much even necessary? Maybe Photoshop or other A/V software takes advantage. Regardless, it's nice to have this much memory available, and future-proofs the machine somewhat. I won't have to worry about lack of memory  becoming an issue.-HD space. So nice to have a terabyte on-board to work with. The average computer user should find the amount of storage ample enough to last for quite some time.-Graphics capability. There are better graphics options for laptops, but those machines reflect that in their price. While this isn't a specialist gaming system, its GeForce GTX 760M is still a more than capable mobile graphics option. Most games will easily run at high quality settings without any loss of framerate, though a few games (e.g. The Witcher 2, Metro 2033, Hitman: Absolution) will require some of the settings (mostly dealing with anti-aliasing) to be tweaked for the best experience. All-in-all a capable gaming laptop.(CAUTION: upgrading my Nvidia drivers from version 320.49 basically killed graphics performance. Maybe Nvidia has fixed whatever issues caused such degradation, but now I'm twice shy about \"upgrading\" drivers. Reverted the driver to 320.49, and graphics performance returned.)-Enough various I/O ports for the average user. Sending output to my TV via HDMI cable worked flawlessly.-Keyboard is decent. Keys feel good and responsive, and are the right size for my hands.-CPU is powerful enough to handle most tasks without struggling. Converting large .avi files to more manageable .mp4s takes relatively no time. Compressing/decompressing archives are the same. Software is as snappy and responsive as the hard drive speed allows it to be.CON:-Hard drive speed. The one real bottleneck affecting system performance is the hard drive's 5400 RPM speed. While most day-to-day tasks are largely unaffected, things like live video capture can be (it still works, but at the bare minimum write speed.) While it would be nicer to have a 7200 RPM drive, or ideally an SSD, those options would increase the price or lower the storage volume.-Display. Maybe it's the nature of laptop screens in this price range, but the blacks aren't all that black. Blacks glow a bit. A Retina display it is not. Could be I just need to adjust my gamma settings, but Windows 8 is failing to apply any changes I make to them. Which brings me to the next con:-Windows 8 & Acer bloatware. Windows 8 is not a -bad- OS, but it definitely isn't the most efficient or logical one for non-touchscreen computers. I spent a couple of bucks and installed StartIsBack, which brings back the start menu and basically reverts the interface to one resembling Windows 7. At least Windows 8 is stable--no crashes since purchase, & I use it daily for a broad range of purposes using a broad range of software.There's also a lot of Acer software pre-installed. Maybe some of it is even good. But I'll never use it and wish installation had been optional.One last nit-pick: the touchpad is off-center and towards the left. Unfortunately if I slide my finger inwards from the right side of the touchpad, Windows 8 brings up the charms bar. Since the right side of the touchpad is where its center would be if it was centrally placed, the charms bar pops up often enough to be irritating. Maybe I'll get used to the placement eventually, or find out how to change the charms bar's activation method. \"Charms bar.\" Jesus.SUMMARY:Awesome laptop for the money. It's powerful enough to be used for almost any purpose: school, gaming, work, multimedia. Good build quality--everything is sturdy and doesn't feel or look cheap.Don't let my list of cons scare you away from purchasing. I think they're valid, but It really is just a bunch of nit-picking. I have no major complaints, am happy I bought it, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a powerful, well-rounded, feature-rich laptop in this price range ($1,129.99 when this review was written.)", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer for the most part", "Author": "Drenski", "ReviewID": "RM2Q2JF9ONQ3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had mine for a little over a week now and I think it's great so far but, there are a few things that I thought some people should know about.  I now wish I had the back lit keyboard however, the white on black keys are visible well enough from light from the screen.  The Window's 8 takes some getting used to but seems easy enough to fumble you way through it.  It didn't take long to understand it but every now and again I do something that I don't know how to get back to where I was and I have to start over again from the desktop.  The computer gets hot and it all blows out the rear left vent.  The display is beautiful.  The shape of the computer being a bit wider than my old 17\", makes it a bit more difficult to slide into a carrying case because I use a wireless mouse and the USB adapter protrudes out just far enough to get caught on the bag.  The mouse pad is nice and very sensitive and sometimes causes me issues when trying to type.  This is the reason I got the wireless mouse.  My old computer had a button that allowed me to turn off the mouse pad.  You have to find the \"off button\" within the software to adjust the mouse pad.  The computer seems well built and looks nice.  The keys seem to be nicely spaced and the keyboard \"feels\" good to use.  It ran some YouTube videos a bit choppily, but that might have been cause by other things.  My old computer running right next to the new one was running the video fine.  One thing that really bugged me, and I'm sure it's not the computers fault, is there were tons of programs trying to tell me that I needed to download them.  Trying to uninstall programs was a bit difficult at first but after learning how to do it from the smart phone style desktop it's easy.

I needed a blu-ray capable gaming system with adequate memory.  I got all that and more.  The 1TB HDD is easily enough for large scale archival of media or documents.  The Core i7 screams through most tasks effortlessly, and gaming performance is top notch for fairly recent games (Skyrim runs on Ultra High with very high FPS).  All in all, as is, this system is a great purchase for media, gaming, and general use (but just browsing the web and doing email would be a waste of power).  The 12 GB of memory included is enough to handle numerous running applications without touching the swap file.Of note, I did purchase a Kingston 120 GB SSD with this laptop to make it even faster.  The laptop comes with an empty 3.5 inch bay!  After loading the OS on the SSD it is almost like working on a tablet.  Time from boot to desktop (before password was implemented) was 8 seconds.  Application load times and game saves are nearly instantaneous.  The system was already nearly this fast, but the addition of an SSD in the free 3.5 bay makes it respond like an overclocked tablet.This is a sweet laptop either way.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Plagued with inherent driver Issues", "Author": "ST P HEWINS", "ReviewID": "R35PRK0XTUQYSR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this gaming laptop for school,work, and play.

I mean, seriously it's just a beast. It's big, it's powerful, and it looks fantastic. This thing is the Bentley of laptops. It might be large, but it will get you where you need to go quickly; and with style to boot.This Acer is replcing my old Dell Studio XPS17 which, unfortunately, decided it no longer wanted to start up after a failed session of instalilng updates. The laptop came very well packaged which is a good thing needless to say. A laptop is one item you don't want getting tossed around in the mail; there's a lot of stuff that can, you know, break.Upon opening the box, the laptop is a gorgeous black brushed metal style finish. Note of course the casing itself isn't metal it just has the appearance of it but it looks fantastic. The laptop on a whole is great from an aesthetic standpoint. The outside finish, the glossy trim on the interior, more of the brushed metal finish where one rests their hands to type, are all flawless. The only complaint I have from the point of aesthetics and functionality to some degree is that the keyboard isn't backlit, but frankly even on my Dell I think I stopped noticing after a while so I don't really hold it against Acer on that one.What some people seem to have a beef with, and understandably so from an advertising standpoint, is that this laptop does indeed come with a matte finish anti-glare screen instead of the usual glossy finish screen. I knew this from the reviews upon ordering and honestly, I like the matte better. It just has a softer appearance and seems less \"in your face\" without any lack of color or resolution; the screen provides a wonderfully bright and vibrant image without all of the reflection. Still, I would recommend Amazon fix that little issue on the discrepency.Alright Jimmy Pops that's cool, but what about under the hood? Well let me tell you Amazon reader, what's under the hood is 12 GB of DDR3L memory and an Intel Core i7-4702MQ 2.2 GHz processor. To be specific, that's a butt-ton of computing power and it shows. Programs, apps, internet, games, they all load fast. Really fast. 12 GB is a lot of RAM, especially at this price point. So while yes, there are laptops that cost less, you're really getting more than your money's worth with this Acer. For you gaming freaks, there's also an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760M graphics card so this thing could most likely handle most games at medium or high settings. Will it handle all of the new top games at Ultra High Eyeball Melting Level graphics? No, probably not, but they'll still look good. The hard drive speed is a little slow at 5400 RPM but I don't really expect it to cause any problems.This is a fantastic laptop. If you have the budget for one, search no further.
