Have not had any issues with this laptop that would make me regret buying it, overall -- very positive experience.  The performance is solid, I had Win XP Pro on it, and now upgraded to Win 7 Pro, and it runs like a charm!  The battery life is very good (I have a 9-cell battery) -- the longeste I've kept the laptop running non-stop is 4 hours, and never needed to plug back in; the screen size (14\") is a good balance for travel and working in comfort. The built-in wireless adapted sometimes needs to be restarted (there is a switch on the side -- turn it on and off to restart the wireless, not a big deal at all), but I only noticed that this needs to be done after the system comes out of hibernation.  I bought this laptop with a deep discount (it was refurbished by Dell), had some reservations at the time of purchase, but am a very happy camper now -- no worries!", "Date": "November 14, 2009"}, {"Title": "Finally backlit keyboard", "Author": "Cordless4Ever \"Cordless4Ever\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZAIO5K3Z69JS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is pretty much configuartion that I got and performance is pretty good with this laptop.Lighted keyaboard had an impact on decission when I decided to buy this laptop and it is really nice and usefull feature that I was looking some time for it.Pros:- Very stable, no reboots and doesn't get frozen even when moving/shaking it- Good metal construction --> no flexing- Good set of connection slots for perrifferrals- Backlit keyboard- Very bright screen but not the best color rendering- e-SATA external connector- Internal Intel wireless 5300 AGN WiFi card is excellentCons:- LCD display is somewhat washed out although very bright- It gets very hot even just browsing internet after relatively brief period. Poor ventilation.- Somewhat heavy for its size- Average battery life (little bit over 3hr of usage when just browsing internet via WiFi with standard battery)- Proprietary HDMI connector (need to buy separate pigtail adapter)I have it almost for a year now and no crashes or some issues or glitches so far.Overall very good business laptop.", "Date": "August 25, 2009"}, {"Title": "Simply Splendid", "Author": "anthony", "ReviewID": "R6NTS4UT41I90", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Shipped w/i 3 days. 3-4 hour battery life depending on what you have running.

I wanted a cheap'o slug of a laptop to install Solaris on - more on that later - This laptop arrived from Red Tag Computers in record time & the thing was MINT !!! ... didn't even look used. Best part was - it contains a Core2Duo - 2.5ghz - 4gigs of ram & came with a 200gbhd. First order of business was to download & install VirtualBox from Oracle - that went without a hitch - then I installed Solaris 10 in a VM environment - that went without a hitch. I then popped out the 200gbhd & dropped in a Kingston Extreme(which also came from Amazon) & I then attempted to install a clean copy of Solaris - that didn't go so well - not sure why - it's complaining about not being able to contact something on the network - which confuses the heck out of me - cause it installed flawlessly in a VM ... but anyway ... This Dell e6400 is one rocking solid little laptop ... oh ... did I mention it came from Red Tag pre-installed w/Win7_64 Pro (sweet !!!) ... so if anyone is looking for a cheap, solid little laptop ... & your on a tight budget ... I'd HIGHLY recommend picking one up from Red Tag - if your in the market for a solid, cheap, slug of a laptop - you can't go wrong in getting one of these - just remember - these babies came out in 2009 - so don't expect this thing to compare with a i3 or i5 etc - what you get out of the box is a solid little laptop to surf, some SIMPLE word processing etc - don't expect this thing to rock w/gig flop's in speed - it's a SOLID \"little\" laptop - beat's the other used slugs out there from misc manufactures ... mine even came with the extended battery !!! ... Red Tag really, really, really out did themselves on this deal. As mentioned, I'd highly recommend both this little beast & Red Tag.Thanks.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I needed", "Author": "Ross A Garofalo", "ReviewID": "R1JRB53QIF1OBA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is much faster and lighter than what I had before.

Don't get confused this is a decent notebook it's just who I purchased it from. Whatever you do don't buy this notebook from Tampa Laptops they shipped me a notebook with no bluetooth module and I had to ask them to give me one since they false advertised. Also there customer service is slow and not very customer friendly.Pros----Backlit keyboard4x usb portsDecent speakersDecent graphics card/Intel GMA 4500MHDAmbient sensor for monitor screenWindows Experience Index score of 3.4Cons----Minor scratchesHeats up pretty quick especially when chargingNo webcam but there is still a mic built inBattery life is a little over 3 hours80gb HDDSo far I'm enjoying my latitude bought from Tampa Laptops. The design is super slick and nice. It has a DVDRW for burning and watching movies. I had to upgrade it from vista 64-bit because it runs extremely buggy and sound is screwed. On windows 7 you can see an amazing difference between vista it runs so much smoother and gives an accurate battery level and time estimates. Drivers where all installed and where easy to upgrade with to windows 7. The charger wasn't the original but is a replacement from Dell so I guess that's good enough. As for storage the hard drive came with 80gb which I can tell you now it isn't enough space for my files so if you get one with 80gb I would recommend upgrading the hard drive ahead of time.

The touch-pad decides when it does and doesn't want to work, which as you can imagine, is extremely frustrating.  Sometimes it will just decide that it wants to turn off, and it does, without warning.  Finally, it cannot understand how to find and maintain an internet connection.  I have an old powerbook (mac) that can find and connect to wireless twice as fast as this brand new laptop, that comes pretty highly rated.
