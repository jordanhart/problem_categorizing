Yesterday, I went to use it for a project and the computer wouldn't start.  I got a message asking me to install an operating system!  I then spent half the afternoon on the phone with HP's customer support.  While pleasant, the technicians could do nothing to help me and HP refuses to refund my money or to send a replacement PC.  They want me to take time off of work to have a technician come over to replace the hard drive.  This is not my problem and HP should be embarrassed to sell such deficient products.  I am a loyal Mac user, and Apple would have made it right.  This is my first and will be my last HP notebook purchase.  Save yourselves some trouble and alot of money by choosing another notebook.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$990.50", "Features": "15 6\" A10 5750 8GB 1TB REF", "Name": "HP ENVY TouchSmart 15-j023cl Notebook, Windows 8, AMD Elite Quad-Core A10-5750M Accelerated Processor", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/416MD4xV3sL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GP4E61O"}}
