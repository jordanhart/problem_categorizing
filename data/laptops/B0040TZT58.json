I hadn't, and don't use it that often, so there is no reason anything of the magnitude of a mother board should be going out on it. It also is very slow in connecting with Internet Explorer and sometimes dosen't connect at all, necessitating that I shut down and redo the whole thing. I contacted Amazon and they deferred, saying that it's a third party seller and would not help me in any way. For it to go down in less than eight months, with only very mild use, is ridiculous! I'm no computer expert, far from it, but even I know that I should not be having a problem this severe, in such a short amount of time. I know I will not buy from this company again and I recommend to others to steer clear of this company.Turns out that it was the mother board. It would have been 350 to repair it and I only paid 200 for it. I say again, DO NOT buy from this company!", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gateway Laptop", "Author": "Sandra Love Rogers", "ReviewID": "R3L7JO3GVUWZXZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, there are a couple of problems with this laptop.  The microphone stays on all the time and I keep getting a white screen for my background.  I do realize these are probably software/driver issues, but it is very annoying.  This may explain the very low price I paid for the laptop.
