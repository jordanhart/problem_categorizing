{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Highest quality to cost ratio", "Author": "F. C. Caner \"fcc-509\"", "ReviewID": "R3AUWNVA1BTXI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, it is huge. Which is good, I think. The screen is incredibly crisp. A bit too reflective, but excellent for indoors use. The HDD led and the WiFi led are a bit too bright for me, so I placed color tape on them, now they don't bother me as much. Finding a laptop backpack was a pain for this monster, and I ordered the Toshiba backpack from Amazon, which was the largest backpack I could find, but it just barely fit in. It would have been a better idea to ship this laptop with a backpack or a bag. The sound of the speakers is great when typical laptop sound is considered, but it is not the best I have ever listened to. Keyboard is nice and firm, does not bounce. Two touchpads on the two sides are a nice touch, especially not having a touchpad right in the middle of the laptop is more comfortable than I thought. It is sort of like reaching out for the mouse. In sum, the advantages are: - best bang for the buck although not cheap, - the looks - the screen is wonderfully sharp, - the speakers are much better than any other laptop I have ever seen, - the i7 is wonderful, - the graphics card is one of the best you can get in a laptop, - the power this laptop packs is fantastic, - runs amazingly cool, - the high speed usb ports, - the touchpadsThe disadvantages are - preinstalled junk software that is not needed at all, - bluetooth problems that were corrected simply by first upgrading and then uninstalling the wireless/bluetooth Widcomm software (let the operating system do it!) - DO NOT attempt to uninstall the WiFi/bluetooth software without upgrading it first, or you may lose all or part of your programs! (just google for \"Widcomm uninstall wipes\" and see for yourself). - I wish the speakers were removable, so that the laptop could be easier to pack. - screen should have been a bit more glossy. - I am not sure if I can unscrew the cover at the bottom of the laptop and reach for a HDD or install more ram, because I can't see any screws under the laptop!Well, my 2 cents on NX90...", "Date": "March 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Best Laptop for me so far", "Author": "settler", "ReviewID": "R1TS69XTR5UWF3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered for this laptop on the labor day weekend online Sale. I had it for 1313.00 on buy.com and that was the cheapest anyone could ever have had as I did an extensive research in buying an i7 processor laptop. This laptop is Solid and very Nice. Powerful Led Screen and the speakers really have very good and crisp sound quality as well as loud for a laptop. its really a magnificent piece of Art work due to the Silver aluminium finish... it has a Metallic Look and the key board is very comfortable and smooth as I am typing this review with it Now. I just ordered a memory upgrade from corsair on Amazon recently and am looking forward to have a feel of this i7 processor at 12gb Rams of system Memory on windows 7. I think it will be super fast cos its already a fast machine...One more thing I love about this computer is that its very Silent and u wouldn't think u have it on if not for the screen and the lights on it. its so far the best computer i have experienced now and I have been a PC User for over 15 years...  I have had and still have a control Room of self built Networked Powerful desktop computers that i use for other purposes So i really have a lots of experience with Windows PC's starting from Windows 95----to Windows 7 ultimate and Fredora Core as Well as SUSE Linux. this Laptop is worth the price its going for cos its fully Loaded and so beautiful that my Wife asked me what is that when I had it Closed and lying on the front seat of my car lol. And its also already prepared for international Use with regarding the Charger, at first I said to myself, this charging Unit looks kinda bulky and big, until I realized that it takes Electrical Voltage starting from 100v(America) to 224(international) without any Step down adapters or anything, just plug it in any country...

It's very large and at 9.7 pounds isn't very portable,however as a desktop replacement it really works. The screen clarity is great,and the sound out of the Bang & Olufsen speakers is unreal. Runs very quiet and has a very nice feeling keyboard. The touchpads work really well ones you get used to it.Overall this computer is a great value,with top of the line specs, metal casing and very premium feel.The mirror finish looks really cool.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Boss", "Author": "Warbat", "ReviewID": "RPH5LAG3QZBUR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have laptops all the way up from an Acer to an Alienware and I call this one the Boss.  In my opinion, I could easily switch that statement to \"all the way up from an alienware to an Acer Iconia\" and still be right.  (I had a very bad experienc with Alienware, but never again) I think the biggest problem with this laptop is that no photos nor videos can do it justice.  The look and feel of this laptop is un-real. I wish it had just a bit more memory, not that I would use it on this computer, but just to say that I had more. I also wish it had a better video card, and again, not that I would use it.  I purchased this laptop for veiwing movies so it handle all needs.  If you can find one I say buy now!", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS NX90JQ-B2", "Author": "Rocco J.

The item was double boxed, but the ASUS shipping box had lots of writing on it, and did not look good.  The ASUS black box and the computer was sealed and brand new.  The computer worked fine, although you need to update the wireless switch on the ASUS site to get wireless networking to work.  The seller was great and I would recommend him for your computer needs.

Called Asus to ship it in for a repair and GUESS WHAT !! they dont ship you out a box and the fedex label that they provide is FEDEX SAVER which takes A WEEK to just deliver it to Asus. It took them 5 days to fix it and ship it out back. Got it back IN THE VERY SAME CONDITION with the VERY SAME PROBLEMS - the FAN IS LOUD and is running constantly , keyboard has problems. Had to send it back again. Was without it for another week and a half. Came back AGAIN WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS, NONE WERE FIXED.Bottom line - SOLD IT and GOT AN HP. If you have a problem they send you a box and they do overnight shipping and NOT FEDEX SAVER.
