{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dell M501R Laptop bargain 449 bucks great!", "Author": "Susan Fiden", "ReviewID": "RC1ROMKCDCEQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking for some time for a good deal on a below $450 laptop running Windows 7 (not because I like running Windows, it is just outside my budget to purchase a Linux machine also). I always prefer Dell because of the quality and the excellent technical support (just try to get an HP computer repaired under warranty) but was having trouble breaking that $400 line. When I saw this M501R laptop offered for $369, I ordered it very quickly, just doing a quick scan of its capabilities and reputation on the net. 4 GB RAM, dual core processor (don't mind this moderately powerful AMD chip since I am not doing video processing or the like on this machine), 500 GB HD (5400 RPM is slow, but for Internet and document, photo processing it is fine), CD/DVD read and write (don't usually see this included on a below $400 machine), big (15.6 inch) screen with fairly nice resolution (hey, what do you want for this price)---not quite as precise display as the higher priced dispalys but my wife likes it fine for TV and movies anyway, Windows 7 Home Supreme (whatever---no one sells lower than \"Supreme\") keeps you in the MS monopoly plot for now, though I do recommend using OfficeLibre (used to be Open Office---free superior equivalent to Microsoft Office handles all document processing needs and is compatible with MS) as I did to avoid purchasing overprices MS stuff, and GIMP if you are an Adobe Photoshop user but don't have a spare grand lying around. Good audio---run the output into a laptop stereo stand. Windows Live Movie Maker is a plus with Windows 7, giving you pretty nice YouTube video production capability.

That was four years ago. Apparently, their standard of quality has gone down since then. I ordered it for sentimental reasons, because I had a lot of good memories with that other computer.This one was okay, but it was kind of bulky to carry around, while the other was just big enough for good graphics and to hold a DVD/CD drive but fit comfortably in a backpack. The mousepad, like with most laptops I've used recently, has so many weird features that often you'll use them by a slight wrong twitch of the base of your thumb - sometimes deleting huge chunks of text while writing something important. Of course it has Windows 7, but it's not like Dell can help that . . . Microsoft just put out a really crappy replacement for Windows XP. (XP was great.) And most people love Windows, so . . . I don't fault the company for that.Something was wrong with this computer though. After just about a week and a half, it started shutting down unexpectedly. This happened more and more until it wouldn't stay on for any length of time. I soon realized it was overheating, even when I had it on cool surfaces. I ran diagnostic tests that showed the cooling fan was not operating at all when it was supposed to. Then, when not running tests, sometimes the fan would kick on, but only after the computer was noticeably hot. Since this was my first new computer in a while, I guess I didn't want to believe it was really goofing up quite that badly so soon. Instead of calling the company and trying to get them to fix it, like sending it in to them, I tried to fix it myself. And that was a bad idea.That highlights another problem with this newer model. My old Dell Inspiron back in the day was pretty simple to take open and examine. This thing was a nightmare, and I had to watch some internet videos from someone else's computer to know how to disassemble it without breaking anything. I felt that it had been unnecessarily complicated since 2008, when I bought the other one. I couldn't see what would be causing the fan to run improperly. When I first put it back together, I thought I had done something wrong, because it would not work at all. And then after another week or so I tried it again on a whim and it'll turn on for less than a minute and then just shut off. My self-repair attempt has probably voided whatever limited warranty came with it, and I'm going to see if I can get someone else to work on it.I can't really recommend this computer. During my online searches I found that several other Dell computers have had a problem with overheating over the past several years. I must have just gotten lucky when I bought that one a few years ago that worked so well (and is the best PC I have ever tried - if any PC would be on par with a MacBook, it'd be that one), but this computer was nothing like it and . . . it bit the dust rather quickly. I think any other brand would be just as good a product, and since Dell is apparently notorious for the overheating problem - not recommended.However, it does have a nice monitor, runs smoothly (when not overheating), great CD/DVD drive which you can use for burning discs. And although unnecessarily bulky, it has several USB ports, which is a plus. If you do decide to buy this, back up all your files first and give it a trial period. If something seriously screws up in a short period of time, don't try to fix it yourself. Call the company and ask for it to be fixed or for your money back. This one wasn't worth the price, in my opinion. Even when it was working, it just didn't seem any better than any of my friends' laptops. And my old Dell used to get compliments all the time . . . must have been a fluke. Wish they still made that model, but I haven't been able to find it anywhere online. I found this while searching for the other.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop At A Fair Price...And, Windows 7.  Read On...", "Author": "John Thomas... \"New England...USA\"", "ReviewID": "R32103EVFWZ4IG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my son who was in need of a new laptop for college.  I have owned Dells since just about the time I knew what a computer was and have always had great success with them.  Far from money being no object, I chose this one for the there really weren't all that many available here on Amazon for the price I wanted to keep it at that weren't refurbished, or had a fair amount of good reviews.  This Inspiron 15 fit the bill nicely all around...I gave this to my son here at my place and he had it set up, customized, connected to the internet and enjoying it well within an hour.  It is very fast, has a most generous amount of memory, and a large enough hard drive to handle years of games and movie downloads.  The set up really was a breeze, even for someone that still uses an old 'puter myself, and have not kept up with the new technology much.  There was nothing that my son was doing during the setup that I did not understand at all.  He truly loves it and is most grateful.  As far as minor annoyances he mentioned that there are no number key. (Not keys with a number on them, it has that, just no \"number\" key on the bottom.  Most laptops don't for some reason).  Also, there appears to be no sound icon in the task bar for turning up and down the volume.  He also has to use the keyboard for that as well. Neither being any big deal that he finds true liabilities.One last thing of importance that I would like to mention. This computer is new, not used or refurbished, and still comes with Windows 7.  Even I, that as already mentioned am way behind in the tech savvy department have heard the horror stories and dissatisfaction with Windows 8.  I strongly suggest that before you buy any computer here on Amazon or any other place with Windows 8 installed, do yourself a big favor and look it up on here and take the time to read some of the overwhelmingly horrible reviews of it.  It's by far the worst system I have seen or heard of as far as customer reviews and satisfaction.  I even know people that have bought new 'puters with it and have gotten fed up and loaded Windows 7 after having enough of the so called latest new and \"improved\" windows. (Or, have taken to installing Windows Shell, a free add on easily available that re-installs some of the classic windows features and look that Windows 8 has done away with). This computer already comes with Windows 7 that works very much like the classic windows that most of us are so familiar with, without all the aggravating crap that Windows 8 is handing you. A big plus in my opinion that my son also very much appreciated.All around this is a fine deal on a great Dell laptop that I highly recommend... : )", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am enjoying my Dell", "Author": "Molly Bilyeu", "ReviewID": "R18FJ1YV488MNF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Dell Inspiron 15.6 and I am most pleased.

We purchased this unit for our daughter, who is a kindergarten teacher. It was delivered on May 09, 2012 and in August 2013, 1.25 years later, it seemed to be performing as expected. BUT, on May 09, 2014, exactly 2 years after delivery, our daughter called and advised that the unit had completely died and according to a preliminary investigation, the processor and/or motherboard had failed. I contacted Amazon, strictly to advise them of the problem. But, realizing that the product is beyond its short 1-year warranty, I was certainly not expecting a replacement but was simply seeking assistance and Amazon has provided that, thus far. I contacted Dell and ultimately encountered one of the most convoluted runarounds in which I have ever been involved. I spoke to a Tech Support rep, who needed certain identifying product information, so I had to agree to call back. When I did, I attempted reach Customer Support but thanks to Dell's \"wonderful\" automated phone system, I ended up with Tech Support. After realizing that the unit was out of warranty, that rep couldn't get me off of the phone fast enough. As though he was reading from a script, in very broken English, he was attempting to explain the principle of a warranty to me. I, in turn, explained that as a 20-year employee of Panasonic Co., I well understood both warranties and product quality and my point was not whether or not the product was in warranty but was whether it was reasonable to expect it to completely fail in two years. He just didn't understand!! Finally, I asked to be transferred to Customer Support. I was on \"Hold\" for 8 minutes before being cut off. I called back and after winding my way through Dell's maze-like phone system, I reached that department. As soon as that rep, who also spoke broken English, realized that the warranty had expired, she transferred me to Tech Support as I was in the middle of a sentence, again attempting to explain my problem with having a product fail in two short years. But, disappointingly, I again ended up with Tech Support, In one last desperate attempt, I futilely tried to explain my problem to a different representative but he, too, in broken English, seemed to read from a script in explaining that the product was out of warranty and nothing could be done. So, on May 10, 2014, I wrote a letter to Michael S. Dell, President and CEO of Dell. Certainly this American could understand the point that I was attempting to make! But, on May 15, 2014, I received a call from a man, purporting to be from the executive offices and responding to my May 10 letter, to Mr. Dell. I did not understand his name, however, since he, too, spoke in broken English! After some discussion, he stated that based on the \"alarm code\" given off by the Laptop, his assessment is that the Processor has failed and according to his explanation, because of the cost, there is nothing that Dell can (will??) do. He then rather insultingly attempted to explain the term \"warranty\" to me but I stopped him, explaining my history with Panasonic. He then made a statement that I will not forget. He said that it is because of what has happened here, that Dell extends warranties instead of guaranties. I took this as evidence of how much confidence Dell has in its products and how little attention it pays to quality. I told him that because of this instance, and despite the fact that I have purchased several Dell products over the years, I will never purchase a Dell product again. He couldn't have cared less, in my opinion, and said that he would take my comment as \"feedback\"!! I will now find a computer manufacturer that at least understands the American way of doing business but I am definitely finished with Dell.
