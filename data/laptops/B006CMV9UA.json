{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Deal! Good Quality Laptop", "Author": "Patrick Higdon \"HIG\"", "ReviewID": "R3E04ER6LSAR8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually purchased this item on another site for $399 after rebate w/6GB of RAM. I've had it for a couple weeks now and it works great. The performance, keyboard, and display can't be beat for the price. The only thing that takes some getting used to is the touchpad being offset due to the larger keyboard. However, it works better than any touchpad I've had including the scroll feature. I've seen similar quality on \"Premium\" laptops. If you can get this laptop for 400 it's a steal and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "December 20, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Gateway NV57H15u 15.6\" Red Notebook PC", "Name": "Gateway NV57H15u 15.6\" Red Notebook PC", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31W85RKIkuL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006CMV9UA"}}
