No Microsoft office loaded so I downloaded Apache Open Office FREE from Amazon.It's a bit noisy when it's charging but it I'll swap that for a slow computer any day!Kept waiting for a good deal on a Dell with Windows 7 but couldn't wait forever.  Amazon had this Dell $150 off so it was time to order.  Windows 8 isn't as bad as I thought it would be.  The tutorial helps make sense of the screens and icons.  Once you figure out that the dial on a wireless mouse scrolls the screen horizontally it's easy to navigate!", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "good unit (except for Windows 8), and good Dell tech support", "Author": "Yannan Zhuang \"salemyz\"", "ReviewID": "RIYY3G9RLZFYJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased mine from Costco, not from Amazon, but would like to share what I know about this unit.  This laptop, at its configuration, is a good price.The most significant good things about it are:(1) it runs pretty well, and does not generate too much heat.  The bottom of the unit is only lukewarm after 24 hours of use (one reason being the hard drive is running at only 5400 RPM, not at 7200);(2) it has wired, wireless, and a blue-tooth connections, and an SD memory card reader (good for trasnferring images from cameras);(3) upgrade of memory is very easy, as both memory slots are easily accessible at the bottom (side by side with the laptop hard drive).The bad thing is:You cannot install Windows 7 side by side with Windows 8, or even over it, even after you shrink the size of the C: drive to create a new partition.  The hard drive has two hidden partitions before the C: drive (So C: drive is actually the 3rd partition).  These hidden partitions are storage area for system restore files, and are valuable if you have to restore or recover the system.  But their presence makes attempts to install Windows 7 impossible, until I manually removed all partitions and recreated C: on the first partition.  (Then I was able to install Windows 7, and am running Windows 7 64 bit without any issues.)I am not saying that Windows 8 is bad.  I just wish to use Windows 7 for now.Now, another good thing is with Dell tech support:First, you can find all necessary drivers for Windows 7 (and Windows 8, of course) on their website: support.dell.com;Second, Dell support is usually very good and very quick.  As my system came initially with \"Rapid Response Depot\", I gave them a call Tuesday (6-25-2013) afternoon at 3, telling them (yes, at India) that I had lost Windows 8 and the backup drives in the process of installing Windows 7.  In half an hour, they got the dispatch arrangement ready, and overnight I received the replacement package (to restore Windows 8) via FedEx.  Next, I'll try to see if I can install Windows 8 on a different partition, and run dual-boot (W7 and W8) on this laptop.  Usually you can install a newer OS (W8) side by side with an existing, older OS (W7) and get a dual boot.  Will update when that task is done.  So, for now, I am happy with both the unit, and Dell support.Update 1 (after receiving the 1st replacement package from Dell): It was an 8GB system recovery USB key.  On running it, it successfully restored my hard drive to the factory setting: with hidden EFI drive (this time only one drive) and with the rest of the hard drive as C:.  It gave me back the Windows 8 system that I had lost, but it erased, without warning, the Windows 7 partition that I had painstakingly installed. So, it did the job of system recovery (to factory setting), but sent me back to square one.  I called again today (7-1-2013), explaining what I need is the stand-alone Windows 8 media, by which I can specify where I want to install Windows 8 (on a different partition, so I can have dual boot).  Will update again when the 2nd replacement media arrives.  Calling and getting to a live Dell tech support (yes, they are in India.  I got confirmation two times) took about 5 minutes.  Getting the new dispatch order done took another half an hour.Update 2 (after receiving replacement Windows 8 installation DVD): The replacement package came via FedEx standard overnight, to my pleasant surprise.  Installation of Windows 8 onto a separate partition was easy.  Update of drivers took some time, but was easy too.  I now have dual-boot.  On booting up, the screen gives me the option of either booting into Windows 8, or booting into Windows 7.  I booted into each OS several times, and both OS are running well, without any issues.  End of the story, a happy one.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Died on day 2", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"vmeiste\"", "ReviewID": "R3CROESFPO9XP4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The only good thing I can say about this system is it has a nice keyboard.Turned it on for the first time and it sounded like a jet taking off the fan(s) were so loud.The fans were constantly running & the keyboard was getting quite warm.Day 2 it gave up the ghost. Network card fried. No ethernet, no WiFi.  I suspect that the unit over heated and fried the network card.Amazon sent two UPS pickups, both with different tracking numbers.  It did get picked up by the first guy who got there. The second guy kept trying for 3 days to do his pickup.  Amazon did credit my credit card with in a couple of days to their credit.I've had a Dell laptop before that is still going strong after 7 years.  This one was just poor design with the internals from the word go.I now have a similar system made by Toshiba with AMD dual core CPUs instead of the Intel Quad core CPU the Dell unit had.  The Toshiba was $75 cheaper at Walmart.  The system is just as fast, the fan hardly runs at all and it is whisper quiet.I would definitely not recommend a Dell product, this comes from some one who is retired after 30 years in the IT field doing just about everything.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not love at first try, but love after a month of use!", "Author": "Vettluver", "ReviewID": "R31OAXAUBG70HA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I waited a full month before placing my review because I felt that would give me sufficient amount of time to get to know this new computer.I must say that at first, I  hated the new Windows 8 version and if you look at most of the bad reviews on this pc, it is in regards to the Windows version and not the pc itself. In saying that, I upgraded to Windows 8.1 and then installed Classic Shell, (a third party app for free), which made my new computer function more like Windows 7 and gave me back my start button that I truly missed :) Since then, I will occasionally convert over to the Windows 8 screen and play around while I get more familiar with it, knowing that I can easily go back to the appearance of Windows 7 so I am now happy :)After 1 month of use, I have not heard my fan run at all so I have no idea what some of the previous reviews are talking about there, I guess I am just glad I didn't get a bad one :)I love the large screen!I love the soft keys!The speakers are so loud that most of the time I have them set to about 40%. When I first used the laptop, the speakers were set at 100% and about blew my ears off from another room so I don't think I will ever need to turn them up to that!I don't like not having a back-light for my numbers pad. I can't tell if my numbers pad is locked or not and this is annoying, but not enough to want a different computer.Overall I am very happy with this computer.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "WARNING: Dell Does NOT Honor Their Warranty", "Author": "GLOW in Florida", "ReviewID": "R19R29MU9FC9Y6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Experienced a major defect in the screen display a few months after the purchase of the computer and computer was and still is under warranty.  Contacted Dell Warranty support (based in India) and sent them a picture of the display screen.  They stated that the problem was not a defect because defects occur within a day of use.  They refused to honor the warranty for which the computer was still covered by.  Tried to escalate but the last individual (name of Jabat Singh) refused to contact their superior and said that he would only give me the number for their out of warranty department. I have purchased a total of 5 Dell computers in the past 10 years and previous to this purchase had good experience with their customer support.  Obviously this is no longer the case and I will never purchase another Dell computer again.

Very fast!! very quick and more room for memory expansion.2. It is light, for a 17.2\" screen it is not heavy at all.3. You do hear the fan but other reviewers have really made it out to be louder than it is - minimal noise (like any other computer).4. Nice clear screen - watching movies or looking on the internet on a 17\" screen is fun and the difference is noticeable.5. The keyboard is top notch - the keys cradle your fingers - so if you do a lot of typing this could be a difference maker.6. Does it feel like a midlevel laptop? - - - yes - but that was what i was shopping for to begin with.  If you are looking for a well made computer to do various daily things on and you want a large screen - this is it!!

I ordered a brand new computer and had rec.'d a refurbish computer that Dell said \" they could not help me because it was not my computer.  I gave at least 2 stars becausebecause before I was of the Phone with Dell Amazon was calling to give me a return label and said they would credit my account the next day which finally happened Friday.I have since order another computer from Amazon.

I haven't had any issues with it being loud at all.  Actually it's hard to tell the thing is running it is so quiet.  Maybe Dell fixed this issue after receiving complaints.

The screen size is awesome and so is the keyboard, even though I\"m still adjusting to that.  I am overall very pleased!VERY FAST SHIPPING TOO!.

There are differences and if your looking for the upper end this is not it. I have all the bells and whistles on mine and thought other then the inside hardware it would be the same as mine. Not true but it doesn't diminish the value of the computer. It doesn't have a backlit keyboard which is pretty nice once you are used to it. It's plain black no other frills. The inside hardware though is still Dell and it worked great. This one doesn't have HD screen and I could tell the difference when it was beside mine, that would be the only thing that dissatisfied me with this computer. It still looks good and the screen is bright its just not HD and this will matter to some. Great memory, great storage and speed. And a great price. Shipped in a Dell box that was sealed. First time I ever bought a computer anywhere other then the Dell site. I was a little apprehensive about it but gave it a try. The only issue I had with the shipping was that by the time I got the tracking number for it I had the computer.

This new item arrived and won't start up right out of the box.  OK, knew about the power switch/excess static electricity BS and trying that at least got it to turn on.  BUT....the screen doesn't work.  Works fine if plugged into an external monitor, but the actual laptop screen is dead.  Yes I tried adjusting the brightness, the external output yada yada and nothing.  Just dead.  Hopefully Amazon will replace, but I'm not hopeful of what I'll get the second go-round.  And ppl wonder why Apple computers are so expensive.  They work!.  Pretty good rip though, I wonder if I could sell ppl dead 4 pound black boxes that don't do anything for $500 a pop.  No...pretty sure I'd go to jail for it.(UPDATE)  Received the replacement from Amazon (thank you Amazon).  Works like it is supposed to.  Like a previous reviewer mentioned, I'm probably going to partition the hard drive and either install Win7 or Linux alongside Win8.  Win8 is horrible and although this system is pretty fast, it does have a tendency to lag.  The fan is louder than I expected...but given the relatively few vents on the case I can understand why.
