Apparently this is a known defect with this model - do a search and you'll find all sorts of user boards with complaints.The 'net is full of ads for replacement parts ( another giveaway of a known problem) The replacement lid cover is $49 and the front bezel around the screen another $30.

This product did not have an I.D. number and I did not receive a certificate of authenticity with the 25 digit number.  I was concerned that I did not receive a new laptop and was also unable to complete the set up procedure.  I called Ecom Electronics and was referred to Dell to solve the problem.  This afternoon I received another call Ecom Electronics assuring me that I did receive a new laptop and he was also checking with me to be sure that the problem was solved and was offering to assist further if needed. All is well and I would recommend this company.", "Date": "May 31, 2011"}, {"Title": "Rough road", "Author": "Ernest C.

The laptop is a piece of garbage.  I bought one through Staples, lucky me I bought the extended warranty program.  It has broken three times for major items.  The last time they replaced the motherboard.  Calling Dell, you will get a call center in India.  The India reps will try to upsell you warranty programs and anti-virus software.  They hung up on me seven times when I told them I did not want to buy additional products.  Dell is garbage.  Their computers are absolutely, cheap low quality trash.

I also noticed the problem with the USB port being too close to the power jack, however, my largest issue with this computer is the battery.  The battery life was never amazing, but after about a year the computer alerted me that the battery might need to be replaced sometime in the future.  Approximately a week or two later the batter stopped holding more than twenty minutes of charge before shutting down without notice.  This seems like a scam by Dell to get people to buy new batteries, but I will never again buy this brand!
