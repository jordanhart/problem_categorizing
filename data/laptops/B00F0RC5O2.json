{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sub $1000 gaming beast!", "Author": "fn new-b", "ReviewID": "R2RASJOQXR6PEE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "PROS:Best price/performance power ratio for under $1000.... period.Dual GT 750M graphics powers through most games and sometimes performs better than more powerful single cards (comparable to GTX 770M).Back-lit red keyboard is geek sexy.Plays MOST games at high/ultra settings at 60 FPS.Overall design is sleek and stands out without being gaudy.Best built-in speakers I have heard on a laptop (have owned 4 and my wife has gone through 2).CONS:Takes some work to get some features working properly (Optimus, Turbo Boost, etc.).Buggy WiFi software/drivers included cause issues (see Other Thoughts).Stock cooling setup doesn't handle CPU/GPU under heavy load very well and temps can get high on certain games maxed out (Bioshock Infinite, Crysis 3).Trackpad is one of the worst I have personally experienced on a laptop.Lots of unneeded crapware/missing useful utility software pre-installed.Other Thoughts:This is ALMOST the perfect Steam gaming laptop! This machine is ideal for Steam and direct download gaming services as it has no optical drive and replaces it with an Ultrabay secondary GT 750M GPU for extra performance. Now, if you think you are just going to take this laptop out and connect to Steam out of box, you may be disappointed. The included Intel ProSet Wireless software is crap and doesn't play nice with Intel N Centrino card on certain networks (N Wireless). I had done my research and just uninstalled this Intel software (you don't need it). I also uninstalled the included drivers and let Windows install default generic wireless drivers and it worked fine. Then went to install newest drivers off Lenovo and forgot to uncheck the box Install Intel ProSet software. Steam could not connect error after install. WTH? Uninstalled software and now working perfectly. Nothing wrong with the WiFi card (5-10 minutes to fix but a pain). Now, onto gaming performance which is why you're probably looking at this. This laptop plays most games in High/Ultra settings without breaking a sweat. Some benchmarks on games tested so far:Alice Madness Returns (Settings maxed, PhysX Medium): 30 FPS capBioshock Infinite (Ultra/No DDOF): ~60 FPS (see below)Dark Souls (DSFix SMAA & AO maxed): 30 FPS cap (no SLI)Dishonored (Ultra/maxed settings): 60 FPSDMC Devil May Cry (Ultra/maxed): 60 FPSElders Scrolls V: Skyrim (Ultra preset): ~60 FPSNow, I said most games this thing doesn't break a sweat, but if you enable Turbo Boost (Lenovo disables by default if GPU is under load) and play Bioshock Infinite the temps soar. Mine got so hot that I saw frames dip to almost 0 momentarily and then recover, a sign of real world throttle due to sensors recognizing ceiling allowable temps. I exited out and reset back to stock base clock (no Turbo Boost) and made some tweaks using Nvidia Inspector to control temps and no more overheating and FPS performance went up. Lenovo should have had a better stock cooling solution (better heatsink, more efficient fans, Arctic Silver Thermal Paste!) in place instead of disabling a built-in OEM feature on the Intel chip. Just lazy. Most games not affected by CPU power, except Battlefield 3 MP and Crysis 3 on certain settings.  That being said if you're using this just for gaming and not doing photo/video editing, complex math equations, flight simulators, using certain emulators  (PCSX2, Dolphin) or other CPU intensive tasks, I suggest you save your money and your temps and get this beast over the i7. Take the money you saved and invest in a decent bluetooth mouse and a laptop cooling pad, or even better- a good priced SSD. This will up your performance and bring temps down further due to no HDD spinning. So why with some of these faults did I give this a 5 star rating? With some tweaks/mods (non hardware) this thing performs like no other laptop at this price (~$900-1000). Overall, I am very pleased with the gaming performance of this laptop and at this price ($879 at this time) it can't be beat!", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Perfect Gaming laptop for those on a semi-tight budget.", "Author": "Mr.Scratch", "ReviewID": "R3FG1FN72ZCO3F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this computer as a Desktop Replacement for class as I am currently out of my home state for about a year. I was never really looking for a heavy duty gaming machine as I just wanted something that could play my current games and maybe some more graphically intense games down the line, but mostly I needed something that was going to get my work done and still be prepared for games and other multimedia when all was said and done.That's when I found this wonderful laptop And after spending a couple of weeks with this I have to say lenovo really knows how to put together a nice and affordable performance laptop.To start off, the design is not too bulky and not too obtuse and it also uses a lovely Aluminum finish to boot. The keyboard has a nice backlight which adds a bit of style to the overall computer, sadly it's not technicolor like some of the more pricy gaming laptops but it is still a very nice keyboard. The Bottom has a wonderfully large vent for cooling, for heavy gaming this is absolutely  necessary as laptops in particular get very hot when doing long gaming sessions, for the best performance I would suggest a cooling pad to make the most use of the bottom vent.The draw to this particular laptop is it's Ultrabay hot-swappable slot, the card on the right side of the device to be slid out for an extra graphics card, another fan, a optical drive or even an extra hard drive. This particular model has an additional Nvidia GeForce 750M graphics card, giving you a total of 4gbs of Video ram. For those of you who want something affordable that can still play those high end games out there this is definitely the way to go as it is one of the cheaper gaming laptops out there right now compared to other brands such as Alienware, ASUS or Toshiba's Qosmio series, and with this additional graphics card it's worth the purchase if you favor gaming performance over a DVD drive right out of the box.This particular model is on the lower side of this series' specs with 6gbs of ram and a i5 dual core processor. If you are working with a budget and don't mind a few games not running on the absolute highest settings this a more than exceptional trade off but if you can spare the extra hundred there is an i7 model available as well, the difference in terms of current games on each processor is insignificant as it is the graphics card(s) that will be doing most of the work along side the ram but it is still a step up from this model (And again only a $100 difference between the two models).For those of you who have an OS preference this uses Windows 8 as it's default OS. If you haven't had any experience with this it won't take much to get accustom to it's features and changes from Windows 7 and below. If you so desire to downgrade to an older OS please make sure to backup the drivers for this computer which can be found on the computer's D: drive. This is necessary for some components such as the back-lit keyboard to function properly.Overall this is an excellent computer for the price and there aren't too many glaring flaws with the computer, with the exception of the Touch Pad which takes some getting use too, but if you are planning on playing games on this it shouldn't matter as you will end up buying a mouse with it anyway.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best ever!", "Author": "FatedCb \"Every one of us has a purpose here.\"", "ReviewID": "R1VSWZKTW75CFX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This thing is a beast!

RAM and 1TB HDD + 8GB SSD Review, WiFi work-around", "Author": "Thomas Kurtzbein II", "ReviewID": "R13LJV509DNPJO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this machine! I really don't have much else to add to the other reviews, but I did want to share what I found with regard to RAM, HDD/SSD installation/upgrades, and the wireless network adapter connectivity issue.If you're looking to purchase the 1TB 5400rpm HDD + 8GB SSD configuration of this machine (Part No. 59390909) for later upgrade, this review is for you. This configuration of the machine comes with a 1TB 5400rpm HDD with 8GB SSD cache HYBRID drive. It is not, in fact, two separate drives, but one hybrid drive, and it uses the solitary SATA interface on the motherboard. The user upgradeable components are fairly easy to access with removal of the battery, SLI/Ultrabay graphics module, and 9 phillips head screws (of all the same size) from the bottom of the machine. Removing the bottom housing reveals all of the user upgradeable components. There is a 'spot' on the motherboard for a mSATA connector (actually labeled), but the connector itself has not been soldered on. If you want to take advantage of the many benefits of an SSD, you will need to replace the factory 1TB HDD + 8GB SSD cache HYBRID drive with a suitable SSD in the 2.5\" SATA port. You unfortunately can't keep the 1TB drive and add a SSD to this particular machine. Bummer. I have heard that the configuration with the 24GB SSD comes with that drive installed in the mSATA port. You would be able to have both drives in that machine, but it is also considerably more expensive.I upgraded the RAM without incident (I used 204-Pin DDR3 1600 SO-DIMM [PC3 12800] Laptop Memory) and it is expandable to 16GB. The default RAM configuration is 1 x 4GB RAM module in slot 0 and 1 x 2GB RAM module in slot 1 (a complex way of saying a 4GB chip in one slot and a 2GB chip in the other). I added an 8GB RAM module by removing the 2GB module and keeping the 4GB module.On another note, I've read about a lot of users' frustration with the wireless network adapter. As I discovered, it is also another component that is user accessible AND replaceable (it isn't soldered on-board). I was fortunate enough to find a super simple solution, however. When I first fired up the machine and started the Windows 8 setup, it asked for me to select a wireless network, etc. The machine found several wireless networks in my vicinity (I'm in a house), including mine, I inputted the requisite information, and connected to the network. The next step in the setup process was to sign-in with my Windows Live account. Again, I inputted the requisite information, but the machine couldn't connect to the internet. It asked me to sign-in with a temporary username, and would allow me to create or sign-in with a Windows Live account later. Upon getting signed in, the machine had a horrible wireless connectivity issue. As others have reported, it would drop my connection with every other webpage, forcing me to reload. The solution I found online (using my phone) was to navigate to the network adapter (This PC > Properties > Device Manager > Network adapters > Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2230) right click on it, go to Properties, then to the Driver tab, and Uninstall the driver. Upon restarting the machine, the driver would be automatically reinstalled. I did this, and I haven't had a single problem since. That's a lot of hoops to jump through for a machine right out of the box.Why did I give this machine 4 stars?First of all, I'm very pleased with this machine. However, the last star goes to Lenovo's advertisement of '1TB 5400rpm HDD, 8GB SSD' which makes it sound like two separate drives when it's one hybrid SATA drive with an 8GB cache, being unable to install a mSATA SSD in the future despite there being a spot on the motherboard for one but no connector soldered on-board (salt in a wound), and the absurd wireless connectivity problems and subsequent network adapter driver uninstallation/reinstallation fix right out of the box. I love everything else about this machine and would highly recommend it to folks--so long as they knew what they were getting themselves into with regard to the aforementioned issues. Hopefully, this review has helped clear some of that up.

Battery life is the biggest problem..hardly 2hours with casual browsing. Gets little hot even with out gaming but nothing uncomfortable.Last week, I've completed Crysis3(in Ultra) and Call of Duty:Ghosts(in High only..bcz its designed for Consoles and ported to PC) so far..its gets hot after hours of gaming..still better heat dissipation compared to other gaming laptops.For prospective buyers who are looking to buy this laptop but confused between i5 or i7...here's my point.I've been monitoring fps in games with Fraps. CPU, GPU usage and heat  with Speccy.i5 proves to be sufficient and haven't throttled anytime so far. Unless games are more CPU heavy(like Crysis3, Battlefield4..), i5 should do the job quite well and it also dissipates less heat compared to i7.So, you can go with i5.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome performance for money", "Author": "Omar Arrieya", "ReviewID": "R1BO2K977NR4Q3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is just perfect. When i just consider this laptop i was afraid it might got a bottleneck because of the i5 and the double gt 750m. Finally i decided to buy it. Regret nothing.If you are aiming for gaming, this laptop will not dissappoint you. This mannage to run BF4 at 1366*768  with ultra settings at a constant 30 fps. As well as all setting on high and same resolution for crysis 3. Also Batman origins maxed out. I think that more than enough to say.For my personal experience, and using it with a cooler, it doesn't get as hot as everybody will think because of the sli. However, the battery life is awfull if you do not remove the second card. You have to remove it and install the drivers of HD intel graphic in order to get a decent battery life, and thats kind of annoying.The trackpad isnt the best either, but that can be solver with a decent mouse.the FullHD display along the jbl speakers are great for watching movies.The procesor will only be a bottleneck if you are plannig on using some copu intensive programs such as video rendering or so. Also the hdd is a little bit slow and if you are used to  the ssd performance, it might bother you.Overall, this laptop is very good, and i will reccomend it.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "it's great laptop  it worth the price which was $875", "Author": "Alan", "ReviewID": "RG320VW4C5BW7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "it is very fast for playing games.  i use it to play many new games which like assassins 4, when i use sli mood, it performs very well without lagging under 1080p with highest setting.

The built in main 750M is okay for most models (however many are factory defective and does not have thermal paste applied properly), however the Ultrabay VGA may be a deal breaker for many people.The 650M in the Ultrabay can operate on relative acceptable temps (max 176F-185F), however the higher clocked 750M (and also the 755M) with higher core voltage will reach 208F in a matter of minutes and starts to throttle with GPU intensive games, like Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, Witcher 2, etc.The reason for this is that the Ultrabay in this model was designed for 650M, which means:a) The fan is too smallb) Technically there is almost no point where the fan could take in air, there is only a small hole at the bottom of the laptopc) There is an aluminium casing inside, surrounding the Ultrabay slot which will eventually overheat and retain the heatI have to note that even though the Ultrabay VGA reaches throttle temperature, the ultrabay fan will not start to work on maximum RPM, currently the only way to use the fans on maximum RPM is to use the dust removal service in the Lenovo software. Running the fans on maximum would help the ultrabay vga, but Lenovo does not allow it, probably because the laptop would be too loud and people would complain because of that.Repasting the ultrabay vga will not do anything. A notebook cooler can help to lower the cpu and built in VGA temp, but it will not help the Ultrabay VGA, it only makes it reach throttle temp slower.In short: A beast of a laptop regarding speed, however the Ultrabay slot is not designed to hold a 750M/755M and the VGA inside it will overheat with any game that utilize 99% of the VGA.It is okay with games like Skyrim and X-Com EU, but Crysis 3, Bioshock Infinite, Witcher 2, etc will fry the Ultrabay.

I'm going to just keep posting this everywhere I can find.Lenovo; For Those Who Don't:January 23rd I received the IdeaPad Y510p from Lenovo, and it ran like a dream for 13 days, then I go to take my dog outside and put my laptop in sleep mode and come back in and it won't turn back on. I called in and had the option to return/refund it or repair it. I went with repair in hopes of being able to keep my data and awaited the box that tech support said I would be receiving in 3-5 days...It's the motherboard that needs replaced; power light turns on but the fans, hard drive, keyboard lights, screen, and even USB power are unresponsive. A $1,649 paperweight.20 days later I call back, having been busy with two jobs in Advertising, furious. I found out that it was never sent out and that it was just kind of forgot about. So you kindly \"escalated\" the repair to an on-site request after you said it would take almost twenty days for a repair and I would still have to wait, that you thought I was sending it in a second time for a second repair, and that you said I couldn't refund it until I told you I talked to a Sales Manager and they said I could and you looked into my history and found I actually did talk to someone and I could due to the situation.Well that on-site guy THAT YOU SENT OUT came today and broke the laptop even more. He lost one screw when taking it apart, forgot to put two screws back in, broke the bottom latch/lock for the laptop, part of the frame (a little plastic clip on the inside but it looks warped now) and was banging the laptop, jabbing it with his plastic tool, and kept saying \"I sure hope I don't broke it, don't wanna do that!\" I took pictures and cringed the whole time. I about had a stroke watching this guy \"try and not break\" my laptop. AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED. It's just been sitting on my desk since I got it.This is a work laptop.I not only make money on this laptop, I spend money on it monthly for my software.I make $18 an hour at the job I got this for, and it has cut back my time there drastically. I can't work there I can only work from home. I was averaging about 3-5 hours a day until the laptop broke. Now I get less because my home computer isn't meant for this work.The software is $20 a month that I can't use.My freelance pays $30-$60 an hour just for design fees.I've lost more money because of this laptop possibly than for what it's even worth.You better get back to me soon.You have my case number.You have my name, phone number, and email.If Lenovo is for \"Those Who Do\" then what you need to DO is start making up for what you DON'T DO.So do something right for once and call me.This laptop has not only cost me time and money, but now it's cost me my patience.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great labtop", "Author": "Y.

Period. Comparable laptops are running $500 more. Plusses are; SLI 750 graphics! High quality 1080p Full HD screen, high quality back lit keyboard, the best speakers I've ever heard from a laptop, very easy access to ram and HDD for upgrading (and wont void your warranty per Lenovo tech support), overall build quality and Lenovo warranty. Having said that, I have some complaints.First and probably the worst offense of all, the stock cooling is so insufficient that Lenovo actually disabled turbo boost on the processor while the GPU (s) are under load. This cuts down on your processing power considerably, which for me is a big let down. I use this laptop for 3d CAD and development as well as a little gaming. This is absolutely unacceptable, especially because it's just pure laziness for failing to design a proper cooling solution from the beginning... And then hiding it from the customers, hoping we won't notice.Second; the false advertising that this laptop comes with a secondary solid state cache drive is just that, false advertising. It comes with 1 incredibly slow 5400 rpm hard drive that has an 8 gb cache built in. There is no option to add a second drive internally without the Ultrabay, although the motherboard is already set up for it. This is another place this unit suffers because almost all offerings in this class have two internal drives and usually already include SSD's. For the price, I can overlook that it doesnt come with the SSD, but not that they just didnt solder the connection for the 2nd drive onto the motherboard and instead reserved it for the more expensive model. The included hard drive is so extremely slow that it's nearly unusable and made worse by this particular unit only having 6 gb of ram. If you plan on getting the most out of this unit, invest in a solid state drive (I suggest the Samsung 840 evo, amazing drive at an even better price). With a solid state drive, this unit works great despite only having 6 gigs of ram and no turbo boost. Without the SSD, be prepared to be frustrated at the astoundingly long and very frequent load times.Third; the track pad is TERRIBLE. Use a mouse.Fourth; LOTS OF BLOATWARE, and no Windows 8 CD to do a clean install.I didn't have the WiFi issues that others have had, perhaps it's been resolved from the factory now. Also, post upgrading to Windows 8.1 and upgrading the video drivers, I was able to successfully re-enable SLI, so it appears this has been fixed as well.I wouldn't bother with the ultra bay accessories. For as much as they cost, you could buy an external HD enclosure or an external dvd drive and still keep your 2nd graphics card installed without risk of damaging it.TL;DR ***BUY THIS LAPTOP***, but IMO a solid state drive is a must have for this unit. Consider spending more for the I7 version if your budget will allow it. If you are just gaming, this unit will work brilliantly.

It is not capable of connecting to 5Ghz networks, which makes it undesirable for high bandwidth streaming and, you guessed it, gaming. Plus the WiFi, as it is, drops connection constantly. Changing drivers, changing to Windows management, etc did not help.-The trackpad is user-unfriendly. It constantly registers phantom clicks and gestures.-The screen is just \"meh.\" The viewing angle isn't great and unless you're looking at things head on it's easy for small details to get washed out.-It comes with SO...

It's fast, it runs quiet, doesn't get too hot. There are only a couple problems with it. One is that the trackpad is not very nice, it sticks in the corner and is not very responsive. The other problem is with windows 8. Windows 8 is a horrific abomination. It is a sin against nature. I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. Thankfully this laptop comes with third party software that restores the start menu, so that's nice.

Chunky, heavy and a heater", "Author": "Indus", "ReviewID": "R2MESGMKCLWMU2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The laptop is utter crap when it comes to usability, you may stop researching this model now and concentrate on some other make/model. Major issues are: Horrible wireless, Heavy, thick, susceptible to scratches and it runs hot.The BIGGEST issue is the utterly craptastic Intel N-2230 wireless card and a bios which whitelists hardware so you can't just go out, buy a better wifi card and replace it on your own. Crap hardware AND a whitelist, what could possibly go right? The card WILL NOT connect to the 3 different wireless routers after it wakes up from sleep or hibernation - the Linksys E4500, the Verizon FIOS router or an old Belkin. Our 2 iphones, 2 ipads, a PS3, Roku, Apple TV, 1 Dell Laptop, 1 Macbook Pro and the original Wii have zero issues connecting to our wireless network. Without wireless connectivity this laptop is just useless for work which we try to do on this machine.The heft is enormous and, in my mind, unforgivable in current technological environment where everything is slimmer, faster, cooler. This is easily twice as thick as my 2013 macbook pro from work. This laptop could also be easily used as a room heater in colder regions and a food fryer in warmer ones - it actually has a giant side vent through which copper fins, the size of mini skyscrapers, are visible.The outer skin is very prone to scuffs, is a fingerprint magnet and scratches easily. We had quite a few scratches after a few days of light careful use - I cannot explain how light and careful use can scratch the outer surface but one way to find out is buy this beast and find out for yourself.All in all an expensive chunk of nothing. There should be wayy better machines available at this price point including the much more stable Yoga which our 10 year old has.", "Date": "September 28, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F0RC5O2"}}
