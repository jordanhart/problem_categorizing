{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Dell Inspiron Mini review", "Author": "John Brady", "ReviewID": "R13ILGQB2CDGFZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This little netbook computer meets almost all of my wife's computing needs: it is light, small, has almost a full-size keyboard, a decently sized hard drive, a readable screen, and performs as advertised. The Wi-Fi adapter connects easily with our Verizon mobile hot spot for good, reliable, and consistent wireless connections. The biggest negative is that it comes with only the bare minimum memory -- 1GB -- needed to run the Windows 7 Starter edition pre-loaded on the computer. To make it more functionally usable, we upgraded the memory chip from 1GB to 2GB, which is the most memory the computer will take. To do that, we had to remove the keyboard -- aaargh. We also upgraded, online, from the Windows 7 Starter edition to the Windows 7 Ultimate edition. With the upgrade to 2GB memory, and to the do-everything Windows 7 Ultimate edition -- which includes multilingual capability -- we can write, send and receive e-mails in Japanese, and run other programs simultaneously. It is still considerably slower than larger laptops, however. To partially offset that, we loaded a 2GB SD card to give it ReadyBoost capability; doing that lets the computer use the additional flash memory the same as an additional memory chip. So, with a relatively cheap upgrade in memory and with a reasonably cheap upgrade to the Ultimate edition, the machine performs quite well for Web browsing, e-mailing, and use of Excel. It does not have a DVD/CD player, however. That may be overcome by using an add-on, plug-in third party USB drive. We have not yet had to use that capability, as we have downloaded all needed upgrades. Thus, in summation, we can recommend this computer if your needs do not include steaming video or significant graphics use. And, the price is right: you should be able to find this computer online for about $260 or so. That's it for us.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Dell Inspiron mini 10 Notebook", "Author": "Pamela Dunbar", "ReviewID": "R39YZXDJ9DR42J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a beautiful item.

Within 6 mths, motherboard started giving problems, power adapter stopped working and screen started flickering. Luckily it was still within the initial warranty.Initially, I was very excited about buying mini because of it's weight and portability. It cost me around $350. Now I think iPhone beats it for its portability and weight if I am going to use it only for internet access. For other uses nothing like normal laptop or a desktop. Never use netbook as your primary computer.Dell is very shady about prices of their warranty extension. They quoted me a warranty price that was almost equivalent to the price of netbook itself. They do not have fixed warranty prices on their website, but they give ridiculously high priced quotes when you call their support center. I was asking for an extension on the existing warranty and they were tricking me with ridiculous price for upgrade, without informing me. Luckily I spotted it. Never take them at a face value. Possibly this is the reason they can afford to offer mini at such a cheap rate.When you cannot trust a company, how can you trust their product?Dell Inspiron iM1012-687OBK Mini 1012 10.1-Inch Obsidian Black Netbook - Up to 8 Hours 8 Minutes of Battery LifeDell Inspiron mini 10 NotebookDell Inspiron Mini iM1012-571OBK 10.1-Inch Netbook (Obsidian Black)Dell Inspiron iM1012-687OBK Mini 1012 10.1-Inch Obsidian Black Netbook - Up to 8 Hours 8 Minutes of Battery LifeDell Inspiron iM1012-687OBK Mini 1012 10.1-Inch Obsidian Black Netbook - Up to 8 Hours 8 Minutes of Battery LifeDell Inspiron iM1012-687OBK Mini 1012 10.1-Inch Obsidian Black Netbook - Up to 8 Hours 8 Minutes of Battery Life", "Date": "August 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy them new.", "Author": "Moe Tadi", "ReviewID": "R2A512DLKUVKW9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not what I expected.Maybe certain items, you should just buy new.Just pay a bit more, and get them new.XOX", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I've had this laptop for over 2 and half years.

I love watching netflix, and it's so light, plus the battery life is amazing! I went from Vegas to L.A. (A 6 hour drive) and it lasted all the way there and still had like %30 battery. I see the reviews here that the people probably didn't treat their laptop well, and therefore are experiencing problems.

Where do I start, well for starters I'm attempting to write this review on the damn thing and I'm having to backspace and delete because clearly my nimblest of nimble fingers are STILL too fat and clumsy to be able to type a full sentence without making a mistake! The keys are spaced so disfunctionally close together if you're thinking of using it for word prosessing or typing of any sort you're going to need the time and patience of a saint.The mouse has a mind of its own,click on one thing it will bring up another, click once it will click twice, click twice it will take 5 seconds to recognise any of your clicks - so slow to catch up with your requests for navigation/commands! AAARGH! Battery life? What battery life? After fully charging it all day I am now sat here half an hour into my work and the battery is already on half life?! I've had this waste of money for less than a year and it has been like this from day one. After 2 hours max you'll get a warning to plug in as you're on 14% of battery life left - this works out in actual terms to be approx 2 mins to find, plug in the charger and avoid losing your work/page. It's quite a race against the clock!Screen is shocking, can't see photo's/pictures/links/emails in their full glory due to this 'mini' design. Some websites are difficult to use (I shop on the net quite often) because you can't view the whole page therefore it's difficult to select things, compare, view options, difficult to explain but more often than not I have to select one thing at the top of the page, use the arrow key on the right to get to bottom of page ( another infuriating task) and then select or read what you want from the botoom of the page, a page which on any self respecting laptop could be viewed in FULL!I can't seem to copy and paste on this thing either, comes up with some ghostly blue arrow when I highlight then right click, instead of coming up with the box that allows you to select to copy then paste. No disc drive? What's that all about?! Speakers are pitiful, very tinny and volume wise - very low output. You'd need separate speakers to listen to anything worth taking note of. Memory is rediculously slow despite having hardly anything stored on here and had extra memory installed.Finally please don't waste your money. It maybe slightly cheaper than your average laptop but the money you save you'll be using to visit the local internet cafe to get the speed you want, page size you need and efficiency which every computer user deserves. Either that or you'll need counselling to recover from the infuriating experience of the technical disaster that is the Dell Inspiron Mini.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "AWFUL!", "Author": "Anonymous Person", "ReviewID": "RZT3AATJ8K9GB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So I didn't buy this laptop from Amazon, but I WAS given a new one by a friend.It is one of the worst laptops I have EVER seen!Within a few weeks, the mouse began to stop moving and not work. The hinge that holds the screen to the motherboard also breaks EXTREMELY easy. As time progressed (I've had it for about a year now), the battery power went from being able to last 8 hours, to dying after 5-6hrs. I would say that these problems are understandable if the laptop was $100 new, but almost $500?! That's a ridiculous price for a laptop with so many problems! I highly suggest not getting this laptop.
