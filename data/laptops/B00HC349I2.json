{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Bought it 4 days ago, had it for 2", "Author": "Kyle Wright", "ReviewID": "RGZRA1AVD6ABB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Sleek, modern looks. Feels well constructed in your hands. Very little bloatware, all of it removable. Great screen. So far, I'm really enjoying windows 8. Bought it to have a small laptop that packed a punch, something I could work, surf, and casually game on. Plan on installing office soon, right now runs Borderlands 2 on highest settings with ease. Very satisfied with my ~$660 dollar investment. I was debating between building a pc or purchasing a laptop and I do not think I could have constructed anything this powerful in a tower for the same amount of money. Runs surprisingly cool to have a dedicated graphics card. Newest Intel chipset was what really sold me on it. I wanted to make sure what I bought wouldn't be immediately outdated. At this point in time I am very satisfied.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Laptop!", "Author": "Samantha Moody", "ReviewID": "R25LXBZ745Q2QE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything is fantastic about it. Only thing I don't like is the fact that it's a dual core, and not a quad core processor. But, I understand how laptop pricing goes. For the price of this machine, it's a steal. Plays my games (Smite, WoW, Mass Effect, Bastion, SWKotoR, Bioshock to name a few) with no issues. Battery life is iffy, so I keep my charger just in case it doesn't want to power through my lecture hall classes. Comes with Windows 8, but that's not all that bad. Most people are irritated with it because it's so different. I learned the tips and tricks before I got the laptop, and I haven't had any issues with anything so far.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop", "Author": "J", "ReviewID": "RAW39OLVGZT8I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was surprised there aren't more reviews... I upgraded from an eight year old laptop. At one point I had nearly a thousand dollars worth of parts in my cart but scrapped it and ordered this laptop instead. Very glad I did. The footprint is small, there's absolutely no noise, it feels sturdy enough and it's powerful enough to throw anything I've got at it.I'm not running games so I can't speak to that, but I am using it for Eclipse and Visual Studio and this little thing is zippy as hell. I've got an external monitor set up and I can multitask on this like a champ without it even blinking.It's fast, it's powerful and it's cheap. I'm very happy with it so far.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Has GPU issues", "Author": "Erik Penner", "ReviewID": "R2TPXO1CYN5VVI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the power but this laptop has but unfortunately the GPU drivers have a tendency to crash.
