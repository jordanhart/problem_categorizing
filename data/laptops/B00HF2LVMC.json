{"Reviews": [{"Title": "All good except the touch pad.", "Author": "J. Donaldson \"Cal-diver\"", "ReviewID": "R2OALU0R747UVG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My wife and I each have a Sony VAIO 14\" flip. Mine is an i5 version and her's an i3 version, both with hard drives. I did a lot of research before buying this type of laptop. It's all good but I really don't like they style of touch pad Sony chose to use in this model. Other than that I'm really happy with it.Pros:- This is a very classy, nice looking, solid feeling, clean, thin, and well equipped laptop. I really like it in spite of the few shortcomings.- The back-lit keyboard is awesome. I doubt if I'll ever buy another computer without this feature.- Fairly light but the 13\" model is much lighter if that is important to you.- Quiet. There have been complaints about fan noise on the 13 and 15\" models but ours are whisper quiet.- Very nice screen, crisp with good touch sensitivity.- Windows 8.1 on our computers is fine with us. We have six computers in the house, 4 running Windows 8.1. The update from Windows 8 to 8.1 is a must. It really addresses some of the complaints about Windows 8. This summer (2014) Microsoft will release a new version that will nearly fully restore the Start button - the biggest complaint people have had about Windows 8.- SD card slot. I wouldn't buy a laptop without one. Our cameras all have SD cards and we went to plug them in without a dongle.- Decent keyboard with a little bit of center flex.- 2 USB 3.0 slots, one powered when the computer is off which is great for charging phones.- Very fast boot up and even faster coming out of sleep mode at less than 4 seconds.- Good power connector. I found the 13\" model has a poor power connection that would fall out as I played with it in stores.- This has the best sound/speakers I've ever heard from a laptop.- We get six hours of battery life every time we use them.- The internal battery is user replaceable by simply removing the back of the laptop. See Sony's youtube demonstration. This was a key factor (along with the SD card slot) for my purchase. I would not buy a laptop without a user replaceable battery. I'm really irritated at so many devices coming out with non-user replaceable batteries. I expect to keep a laptop 5 or 6 years during which time the battery will need to be replaced about 2 times.Cons:- For some reason this laptop will drain the battery in less than 3 days in sleep mode. I can leave my 8 year old XP laptop in sleep for at least two weeks. Consequently I always shut this laptop fully down if I know I'm not going to use it for a day or more. I don't know if this is an operating system problem or the hardware.- The power button is poorly located and difficult to find and push. It is way at the back right side and must be depressed below the surface of the side to activate it. Sure it is secure so the laptop won't turn on easily but they could have put it on top next to the keyboard and it would have been easier to find and use. This isn't a big deal though. I got used to it.- The edges of the surface where the keyboard is mounted are sharp. Held in certain ways on my lap I find those edges can irritate me by digging into my arm for example. Sony could have rounded them off a bit.- A tablet replacement it isn't. It has all of the functionality but at this weight it is double or more the weight of a 10\" tablet. It is heavy to hold with one hand to be sure. I find that if I do use it in tablet mode I'll spin the laptop 180 degrees so the screen faces me but it is tilted up so I don't have to hold it. I set it on my lap with the keyboard facing away from me. In that orientation it is easy to use it as a pseudo-tablet whether on my lap or on a table. I just don't see anyone holding this while standing and using it in tablet mode for more than a few moments. Of course I'm comparing a 14\" device with a keyboard to a 10\" tablet only so it makes sense.- Three little lights on the front under the deck plate; poorly positioned and hard to see without bending down or lifting the laptop. Fortunately they aren't all that important to see.- My big #1 complaint is the touch pad. I am not a touch pad fan at all and try to avoid them as much as possible. But certainly there are many times when I don't have my Bluetooth mouse ready for action. So I have to use the touch pad. I just don't like the action of dragging my finger over the pad to move the cursor, many times having to repeat that action to get the cursor to where I want it. But the really big problem is the pad Sony chose has the right & left buttons incorporated into the pad rather than being physically independent buttons. I tell you they are hard to find and use, they don't give good feedback in the form of a nice positive \"click\" sound, and I simply hate using them. Had I known how much I would dislike this lack of extra buttons I would not have bought this laptop. Every time I use it it bothers me. I have a small Bluetooth mouse and a trackball for when I don't have a flat mouse friendly surface. But both the mouse and trackball have to be hauled around and connected. The touchpad is also centered under the keyboard rather than centered with respect to the laptop edges. That puts it a little more left than I expect it to be so I very often hit the right cursor key rather than the left. I find the whole thing very frustrating. Keep in mind that I generally hate touch pads though so you're experience might be much better than mine.I am a fan of what Microsoft is trying to do with a single OS that is used on smartphones, tablets, and laptops or desktops. That is why I so much wanted a 2-in-1 laptop. I have a Samsung Galaxy S3 (user replaceable battery!) smartphone which I use all day for many of my computing tasks. I also have a desktop for my serious computing. The laptop is mostly for travel so it might sit for weeks. I have discovered a few surprises about using it.1) I don't use tablet mode very often. I find the whole tablet thing to be restrictive in that normally only one application fills the screen. Oh in Windows 8.1 you can have 2 or perhaps even 4 things on the screen but I haven't gotten used to that yet and it is a bit of an exercise to pull it off. While I have a fully functional laptop in my hand I just don't find myself wanting to go into the so called Start Screen to use the so called Modern Apps. I would say my tablet use of this laptop is less than 5% and that is usually just experimenting and playing a bit with that interface.2) I'm very surprised at how much I use the touch screen in desktop mode. It just seems natural, having used the smartphone so much, to reach up and touch things, and I do. Some things are quite small so difficult to touch but there is the touch pad, mouse, or trackball to back up the touch screen. I also purchased a digitizing pen which works okay but it is again another thing I have to bring along and have handy. Also it looks so much like a regular ball point pen that I have to guard it well so someone doesn't wall off with it thinking it is a pen. The disadvantage of the pen is it begins to work before you touch the screen with it so things might happen before I expect or want them to. But the finger on the touch screen is so good I'm using it a lot.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Powerful multimedia computer with brilliant design", "Author": "C.P. \"Artist\"", "ReviewID": "RON4XXJGK1YHD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent machine! It is plenty fast for everything from browsing the web to watching movies to using professional design apps like Illustrator and Photoshop. Great ergonomic design that feels like an ultrabook but acts like a workstation laptop. Keys and track pad take some getting used to if you are used to Macs however this machine rivals the Macbook Pro for much less money! Beautiful HD quality screen display. Perfect combination of style, power, and useability. Windows 8 is wonky at first (not the machine's fault) but I am starting to warm up to it and maybe even like it.UPDATE: Over-sensitive trackpad problem that is mentioned in other review can be easily fixed by looking for \"smart sense\" settings under the Synaptics ClickPad V8.1 mouse / trackpad driver menu.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Junk - DO NOT BUY!", "Author": "P. Holzmann \"Blue Raven\"", "ReviewID": "R17AMXKICDK6XO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "WARNING!!!!This laptop/model apparently has a manufacturing hardware issue where the wireless antenna stops working. I had mine for only 2 weeks and then one day no wi-fi, phone got on wi-fi, tablet got on wi-fi, but this brand new Sony Fit 14 no go. So I checked online. This is a KNOWN issue by Sony. Do they recall them NO. I read that they can send you a wi-fi dongle for a new laptop. No thank you I luckily was able to return it. Due to time constraints I needed to get a replacement at Best Buy (Probably paid more) but I needed a laptop yesterday.My advice is go with ASUS, that is the brand I went with and I am very happy with my purchase (even if I paid more then I could have).So in conclusion I would NOT BUY this piece of junk and send the message to SONY not to sell junk and if they have an issue then recall the laptop.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Brilliant. Has seemingly addressed most issues with the previous series.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RFC4ZMXPRNXLO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had been looking at getting a new laptop for some time. I didn't have any strange needs or requests, but I did want something that could handle a little video editing, had a 4th generation i7 and had a nice screen. During my research, the previous series of the Vaio Fit kept popping up. It seemed to have many of the components I was looking for at a very nice price....but they were using the 3rd generation i7 and, let's be honest, there was clearly an issue with the wifi card. Many claimed theirs to be working fine, but there were just too many complaints out there to be ignored.Now though, Sony has addressed all of these issues and updated pretty much everything, and with the only other review here (at the time of writing) giving only 1 star, I have been so happy with mine that felt I should try and restore some kind of balance.Firstly, let me address the previous series wifi chip issue. I have had NO problems at all. None. It is a strong connection anywhere in my apartment and has never given anything but top speeds. File transfers within my home network are fast and there have been no drop outs of any kind. Excellent.Secondly, the updated components with this series really make it. The new 1080p screen and the 4th generation i7 really bring it all together, as does having the additional graphics chip. The screen is lovely. Very crisp. Plus, this thing is fast. It has handled everything I have thrown at it. In fact, as I write this review, I am rendering a hi def video that I have edited, am transferring files AND am downloading video files and it is all rolling along nicely.The battery is excellent. I have been able to get close to 7 hours using it for typing while connected to wifi, downloading files and playing music. I even squeezed in a little Age of Empires when I should have been working. I certainly cannot complain about the battery life at all.Windows 8: I actually love it. Yes, it IS a little strange at first. And considering I came from running XP (still great after all these years, but not supported as of April 2014) I was able to navigate the latest Windows without problem. People moaning about Windows 8 and its lack of start button need to calm down. There IS a start button of sorts. It just takes you to a new screen rather than a pop up list. Get over it. Do spend some time playing with Windows 8, customize a few things and make it yours. I am a fan.My previous laptop was a 5 year old Asus Eee pc workhorse running XP, but I have extensively used HP laptops and Macbooks with work, so I am not completely clueless about these things, but I can honestly say this Vaio Fit running Windows 8.1 trumps them all. HPs are for parents buying their first computer and Apple is nothing but a lifestyle brand. Sure, they use top components, but their operating systems are TERRIBLE and they cost a small fortune.But this Sony....I can't help but love it.So, maybe you have read professional reviews where they moan about the lack of SSD or aluminum body....get over it. You won't find both of those things with every other component being as nice as these for this price. The great screen, the additional graphics chip, the 4th generation i7 and in a very classy design....seriously, this thing looks great. And a DVD burner rather than a blu ray drive? Who cares? I've never even bought a blu ray disc in my life. Most people can live without it.So if you are after a nice laptop with great components which looks brilliant and runs very well and have been looking at this, I can confidently recommend it. Not only have all previous issues seemingly been addressed, but things have been updated considerably.Very happy with this.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good... but could be better.", "Author": "Carlos Augusto Fran\u00e7a Schettini", "ReviewID": "R5KX1K3PX4CPD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Good machine, but could be better with Windows 7... the touch pad is too much sensible and make you click in wrong places!
