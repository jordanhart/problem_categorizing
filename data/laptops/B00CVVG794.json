It looks good, It has up-to-date architecture, and it is very upgrade-able. That's why I bought it.First thing was to replace the hard drive with an HGST Travelstar 2.5 Inch 500GB 7200 RPM SATA II 16 MB Cache Internal Hard Drive (0S02858) for $49.00 from AMAZON, install Windows 7, and double the RAM to 8 gigabytes of DDR3. Now I have a modern, highly capable laptop for not much money, and the satisfaction of contributing to the resultant machine.The 320 gig hard drive removed is use-able for external storage. Oh, and you have to download the drivers for Windows 7 from Lenovo, 'cause this was built as a Windows 8 machine. Also you have to change the BIOS to get it to boot \"normally\".", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great PC. But Windows 8 is a pain.", "Author": "C.

The hardware settings and drivers might be set to run this OS but it maxes out the Memory and CPU usage pretty much constantly. Opened the task manager to keep an eye on what makes it max out and opening this window alone (nothing else running) brought it up to 99% CPU usage and jumped between 70-80% Memory usage. I will be upgrading the Ram as soon as I get paid and getting a new OS as soon as humanly possible. It won't run Netflix, Youtube videos glitch and don't load, even the simplest Gif image files run worse than my 2 year old smartphone. I had a 2007 Dell made Alienware that ran better than this thing. Also had a 2005... TWO THOUSAND FIVE(!!!!) IBM Thinkpad with 2gb Ram and an 80gb hard drive that would run videos better and didn't max out so easily. Got stuck on updates and had to wait for it to revert, it was stuck on update \"32 of 60\" for over an hour and froze. The craftsmanship is exactly what you would expect; plastic and light, keys are weird and the set up is hard to get used to at first but the number pad addition is cool, I need that for work so that part is okay by me for sure. But if you need this thing for ANYTHING important or work related right off the bat don't even think about buying this thing unless you have some Ram laying around and are really good with swapping out operating systems and updating drivers manually and all of that headache. Basically this computer would (and hopefully will be) be good for some upgrades, which are reportedly easy to do, and will run Ubuntu or some other way less demanding OS better than Windows -hate-. Also, disk drive is odd at times, it works fine and video replay is actually pretty good when watching a movie etc but it sometimes just doesn't recognize the disk and I can't really figure out how to fix that issue. Sidenote; the noted problems with the wireless card, actually haven't had any issues with that at all it recognized our Wifi with no issues and if I had passwords at work it picks up signal from 10+ routers and there's only 5-6 in our building so that's cool. Hopefully this helps someone else, like I said I think it has potential with some work and a little money but as is... I wouldn't give this thing to a 12 year old for Christmas because it won't even run the simple things like Flash games without clocking out pretty hard. (No offense to any 12 year olds out there looking at this, you're better than this laptop. It's a compliment)", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "function", "Author": "Charles DeRosso", "ReviewID": "R1LS911ENMH7JX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "not happy w/speed or wndows 8 format. to slow and Ikeep losing things.
