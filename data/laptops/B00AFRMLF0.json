This one was purchased for my daughter - a high school student, with the expectation that it will give her at least 3 years of consistently dependable service before replacement. I don't thinkI'll be disappointed.Prior to this purchase I had the opportunity to try out this laptop in a local store, and ended up buying it for her there due to an outstanding sale price combined with these 3 'selling points'.1. Excellent build quality of this HP laptop by comparison to other brands at the same price point made me take notice.2. Laptop includes HDMI, Bluetooth, and an Intel Core i3 processor, in addition to a healthy 500GB hard drive.  Ideally I would have liked to have USB 3.0 on it, but 3 USB ports combined with zippy performance and the other features make this one stand out.3. Display, touchpad, keyboard and sound are all solid performers.  I played a few music videos to gauge the quality of the Altec Lansing speakers and while they lacked richness in sound, for a budget laptop they were good.  The 15.6\" display was bright and sharp, and I'm sure DVD movies will play nicely on this PC's DVD+R/RW drive.  The keyboard has very shallow keys (light touch with very little play) and the touchpad was very responsive.A surprise was how quick this one performs when surfing the Internet, and switching between applications. Very impressive, and I think it's a combination of the Windows 8 operating system and solid hardware being pushed by an awesome Intel Core i3 processor.This laptop is not a gaming PC, nor what would be considered an entertainment center laptop.  But it is a well configured general use laptop that will serve students and most home users very nicely on a lot of levels.  Two things that you generally don't see on budget laptops: Bluetooth and HDMI, this one has on it.The laptop ships with a a 60 Day Norton antivirus software package. Use up the 60 days FREE, and then remove it and get something else. I'm not a Norton fan and I prefer Webroot SecureAnywhere Internet Security Plus 2013 - 3 Devices. Despite not having previous 'happy' times with Norton, I have to admit it doesn't bog this PC down in the slightest, so maybe Windows 8 and Norton are living in harmony?  Time will tell.The PC comes with HP Setup Instructions (one sheet front and back) which explains how to put on the battery and charge it, a system diagram of buttons and ports, how to navigate the Windows 8 start screen, connecting to Wifi, and the very useful 'Using touch gestures' to get the most out of your touchpad.FYI...you can turn the touchpad on and off by a tap on the upper left hand are of it.  If you find it's not working... start with a tap there and see if it doesn't fix the problem.As for Windows 8, I'm not a fan... well, maybe.With the colorful 'app-filled' home screen of Windows 8 and navigation that's different than Windows 7, it may just be this old dog's reluctance to learn a new trick which makes me reluctant to like it just yet.  However when you get a laptop that moves as quickly as this one does out of the box, you have to look at what makes it perform and Windows 8 is part of that picture.The nice part about Windows 8 is that you can make it look and feel like Windows 7 if you want to, so truly, no worries. *Check out the video part of the review to see that one.Windows 8 is much lighter on system resources than Windows 7 (by about 50%...) and it's easier to restore after a failure, thus it's probably here to stay so time to embrace the change.One issue you may encounter upon attempting to update Windows 8 on any HP laptop is a stalling of the update at 12-15%.  HP Support addresses this issue, as does Microsoft.  It appears that some HP laptops have this issue; a conflict with Windows 8 and HP sound drivers, but it can be worked out, with proper steps leading to a successful update. **I didn't run into this issue on this laptop - updated and installed without a hitch, but wanted to make sure you were aware of it in case you do.**Overall, this laptop is impressive. Well built and performs well, with a decent battery life of about 4 hours.  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants a good everyday workhorse. But if you'll be doing a lot of video editing or hardcore gaming, save your money and make sure you have a PC with an upgraded video card, not shared memory.  This is the Achilles heel of this machine.I wish HP had put a 3.0 USB port in place of one of the 2.0 USB ports), and added a better webcam - this one is low resolution and kind of has a grainy output.  I originally gave this laptop 4 out of 5 stars for these two things, but the more I use it the more I feel good about giving it 5 stars for its quality and performance, at the right price.A really nit-picky thing is the laptop's finish. Fingerprints show up immediately!  Shiny, black and beautiful, but keep a microfiber cloth handy to wipe off the smudges.Finally, I would suggest an upgrade to keep things moving as quickly as possible with this laptop. Max out your laptop's memory to 8GB get the  most bang for your buck.  You don't need to do this, it works great out of the box, but it's a cheap upgrade that pays off immediately in system stability and quickness.I updated the current 4GB of memory (mine came with one Kingston Value RAM 4GB 1600MHz PC3-12800 DDR3 Non-ECC CL11 SODIMM SR x8 Notebook Memory (KVR16S11S8/4) installed) to the maximum 8GB. There are 2 memory slots so if you buy another one just like the first, you'll max out this notebook PC's memory.  Note: the part number on the Kingston memory in my laptop is 641369-001 which is DDR3 SDRAM SO DIMM 204-pin 1600 MHz ( PC3-12800 ) as above.If you don't know how to add the memory, go to the HP site or check it out on YouTube.  It's very easy to do!The bottom line - it's a great computer!  My daughter loves it and it was a breeze to set-up.  No glitches with Windows 8 updating as some HP owners have experienced, I've found not issues adding programs and Windows 8 while it looks different, is actually faster and more fun to use than Windows 7.I recommend this laptop as a solid Windows laptop PC choice for students and home users who aren't looking to do video intensive gaming or video editing, for which I'd recommend PCs with separate video cards.HP 2000-2b24NR Specs:Windows 8 Operating System2nd Generation Intel\u00ae Core(tm) i3-2328M Processor2.20GHz Processor Speed4GB DDR3 SDRAM (1 DIMM)- Maximum Supported 8GB - 2 Accessible Memory SlotsIntel\u00ae HD Graphics 3000 - With Up To 1696MB Total Graphics Memory500GB 5400RPM Hard DriveHP Imprint Finish In Black LicoriceHP TrueVision HD WebcamWith Integrated Digital MicrophoneSuperMulti DVD Burner15.6\" Diagonal HD BrightView LED-Backlit Display (1366x768)10/100BASE-T Ethernet LAN (RJ-45 connector)1x1 802.11b/g/n WLAN and Bluetooth\u00aeMulti-Format Digital Media Card Reader - For Secure Digital cards and Multimedia cards.Altec Lansing Dual SpeakersFull-Size KeyboardTouchpad Supporting Multi-Touch Gestures With On/Off Button3 Universal Serial Bus (USB) 2.01 HDMI1 VGA (15-pin)1 RJ-45 (LAN)1 Headphone-Out1 Microphone-InApproximate Dimensions:Width14.80\"Height1.41\"Depth9.72\"**Note that this laptop ships with Windows 8, NOT Windows 7 per the Amazon description.UPDATE: 1/24/13In the lower right hand tray in the version that looks like Windows 7 you'll see a blue 'HP' icon, which may have a white exclamation point with a red background.  Click it.  This is to view the HP Support Assistant.Once open you can download and install updates to your PC.  The first one you should do is the BIOS update.  Do it first, before any others, and then restart your laptop.  This is different than the Windows Updates that run on your PC, as it's part of the nerve center of your laptop and keeps things running happily along.Other updates (I had about 15 initially) will be required for video drivers, etc..., and can be automatically updated and installed, with intermittent restarts as needed.  Eventually (about 45 minutes for this initial one for me using a highspeed Internet connection...), you'll be all up to date.You can also set up a system clean-up to be run every month, 3 or 6 month intervals.  Go ahead and set it up and run it for the initial system restore point to be created, just in case things crash and you want to 'restore' any time soon.Windows Updates can be checked for using this HP Support Assitant function too.Also, if you're finding you have a sluggish Internet surfing experience with this PC, turn off Norton's extensions and you'll gain back your speed.  Norton will still be running on your laptop, just not with every bit of browser protection put up.  Truly, you'll still be safe and speedier too!", "Date": "January 21, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "In the Box - HP 2000-2b24NR, AC Adapter, 6-Cell Lithium-Ion Battery (47WHr); Pre-installed Software - Windows 8, Microsoft Office 2010 (Buy Microsoft Office to activate this software), Norton Internet Security 60-Day Subscription, 1-Year Limited Warranty\nIntel Core i3-2328M 2.20GHz Processor\n3MB Smart Cache\n4GB DDR3 SDRAM (8GB max.)\n500GB 5400RPM Hard Drive", "Name": "HP Open Box 2000-2b24NR 15.6\" Notebook PC", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ShboqDlYL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00AFRMLF0"}}
