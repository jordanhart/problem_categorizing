Great for normal use. The display is really good. THe only thing you might have ttrouble getting used to is that the touchpad is just one big rectangle and it still and right and left click but you use those by pressing down on the bottom left or bottom right. Its really nothing too much. Speakers are good enough for me, Not the best but good enough on my opinion. Other than that its a great laptop!!

It's fast and smooth, touchscreen is a great feature for me. Ram is awesome as well as the CPU boost that kicks is when needed. I am a graphic designer, and when I am not on my desktop I use this as a portable tool. Great graphics, smooth performance, great quality materials and cool to the touch. Very portable, I would say battery lasts about 4 hours on constant use. Portable and sleek, many people think it's a macbook. Best lap for your money, I saw it on Fry's as well as Best Buy for 679+tax. I am finally able to get Windows 8 to a good use thanks to the touchscreen. I am using Corel Draw X5 as well as a Bamboo tablet. Sound is clean, though I do not what the fuzz is all about Beats by Dr. Dre.

Don't get it Ive sent it back to HP 3 times and its only 7 months old. Once when the fan clunked out. Still gets hot, really hot. Twice for the Wifi. I sent them it for the WIfi as its connection is about 50% weaker than all my other computers and some are 10 years older, still with better wifi. Im beginning to think the issue has nothing to do with the WIFI and everything to do with a design flaw from research. This alone is a deal breaker. Secondly it has an issue that happens were it makes a high-pitched whirring sound and freezes for a bit. Ive gotten absolutely 0 help from HP's tech support or customer service and each time they just send me a box and say they'll fix it. They don't. The keyboard is sub-par and flimsy. IT gives a bit and that can become very annoying. The case is made of a material I personally HATE. It scratches very easily and gets freezing when computer is off and in a cold room. To bad this dosnt help cool the laptop down when its functioning. Its also very heavy. close to 6lbs. The touchpad is also horrendous. Jumpy and wayyyyy to responsive, it jumps when you click and no matter how far you turn down the sensitivity settings it still does it. It is one of the worst touch pads I've ever used. DO NOT GET THIS. DO NOT GET THIS. I BEG YOU DONT PUT YOURSELF THROUGH IT. You can do wayyyy better for this price", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Got a bummer laptop.", "Author": "Jennifer", "ReviewID": "R3SECJ6U52DX03", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The particular laptop I got was defective.

In only 3 weeks of gentle use, my built-in Synaptics clickpad is no longer working.  I have called their customer service reps, who were all condescending, three times now.  Troubleshooting hasn't helped and now they want me to remove all of my data and reinstall Windows.  But they forgot to mention that I should remove all of my data first.  Thank goodness that I knew enough to be able to identify what they were guiding me to do, before it was done or it all would have been lost.  That's not even addressing the issue of all of the software that I have paid for and installed, which will also be lost on a reinstall.  Further, all of this needs to be done, before they will even consider taking it in for repair and they require taking it in for repair three times before they will even consider replacing their faulty product.  I may be better of just waiting for the inevitable recall.  Or perhaps initiating the class action that will demand the recall.

However, I am 44 years old and have been an avid laptop user for years.  I have always owned Gateway laptops and loved them. The HP Envy M6 TouchSmart was a gift from my best friend when my 6 year old Gateway bit the dust due to a spill.  I was so excited to have a \"touch screen\" laptop.  How cool, right?!  Wrong!  The first couple of days, I kept telling myself that there must be a learning curve for the touch screen features and the mouse pad with no left/right click buttons.  Here I am a month in and I have grown to despise this laptop.  I am annoyed daily as I try to write research papers, surf the net, etc.Here are the problems I am finding:1)  The mouse pad:  Again, there are no right/left click buttons so, you have to use your thumb to hold down the left or right corners of the mouse pad while using your  pointer finger to select/scroll.  It is so awkward and difficult.  The touch pad is just that \"touchy\" and oversensitive.  I end up accidentally zooming the screen up to 200% or minimizing it down so small it is illegible.  Basically, the mouse pad is nearly impossible to control.  I find myself frustrated to tears every time I must use it to scroll/select/click.  I am AMAZED that there aren't more negative reviews here.  My 23-year old daughter said it reminded her of a Macbook touch pad. However, she said it was the worst touch pad she had ever tried to use. The mouse pad also allows the user to move their fingers on it as if it were the actual touch screen.  I find that this feature is touch and go as well.  Sometimes it seems to work with minimal touch.  Sometimes, I have to bear down to get it to scroll.2) The touch screen:  While this is a very \"cool\" tech feature, it falls short.  The screen becomes dirty quickly.  No matter how often you wash your hands, the oils in your skin are going to cloud the screen.  Secondly, just like the touch pad, the screen is either over-reactive to touch or fails to react with touch.  I watched all of the tutorials multiple times to ensure that I wasn't missing something. For instance, the tutorial says that in order to close an app screen, you can use the touch screen to \"drag it to the lower left corner\" and this will close the app.  My daughter and myself ended up bursting into laughter after 20 minutes of \"dragging\" the screen multiple times only to have it \"pop\" back open.  The \"on screen\" keyboard that pops us is awkward to use as well. Since it is \"on screen\", you certainly can't use the QWERTY method of typing.  It is more of one finger point and click keyboard.  You can't use two hands and type fast due to the angle of the keyboard being \"on screen\" and in front of you.3)  The keyboard:  Compared to the Gateway laptops that I am used to, this keyboard has very short (shallow) keys which I don't find as responsive as a taller, thicker key.  I am an above-average typist normally but on this keyboard, I am making tons of mistakes.  Often, I find that keys are not responsive without being pressed with a lot of force.  Again, this makes writing papers for my Master's degree quite frustrating.  I am constantly having to go back and make corrections because, a key stroke was not recognized.4) Windows 8:  This machine came with Windows 8 loaded and it is horrible.  I am not sure what the designers were thinking.  Again, I am very aware that new programs and technologies require a learning curve.  However, when I read reviews online re: Windows 8, I am finding that other users are having the same complaints.  Windows 8 is NOT user friendly and has tons of bugs.  This just adds to my already frustrating experience with this new laptop.5) The power cord: It is significantly shorter than the laptop cords I am accustomed to.  The worst part is that it comes unplugged from the laptop power port OFTEN with just the slightest movement or jiggle. It is as if the power port and the power plug don't securely \"click\" into one another.  Every time I shift in my chair while writing a paper, the power cord comes unplugged from the lap top and falls to the floor.As far as appearance/speed/memory/RAM/cool features, this computer is great.  It is just that all of those cool features end up being a pain in the @ss because, they do not work appropriately.I feel guilty complaining since this was a very expensive gift from a friend but, it is horrible.  I am going to end up buying myself another Gateway lap top as soon as finances permit.Please try this lap top out in a store before you consider purchasing.  It is so \"buggy\", it is exhausting to use it.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00G5YG518"}}
