Hard drive is already failing with very little use of laptop and not much movement. Supposedly is a toshiba hard drive and write ups on tech sites are not kind. Toshiba's attitude, as usual, is tough, out of warranty (and all I asked for was the disk not a replacement).  1 1/2 years is pretty pathetic. Buyer beware. Go to the Toshiba repair web site (their own!!) to see all of the complaints.", "Date": "December 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba-Horrible Customer Service And Horrible Preformance", "Author": "Robert Pellet", "ReviewID": "R2R93GSAWXD2FW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought a Toshiba Satellite C-655 in March and it is the worst laptop I have ever owned. From day 1 it crashed(Blue Screen) regularly. After finally contacting Toshiba after my hard drive would no longer work I sent it back for repair.I spent a long time with their representative describing my problems. I stressed in no uncertain terms that the major issue was crashing.(blue screen). I returned it for service and when I got it back the repair ticket said computer would not boot up-replaced hard drive.I turned the machine on and in 90 seconds the laptop crashed,yes blue screen again. They completely ignored my original complaint ,installed a new hard drive ,saw it booted up and sent it back.Worst customer service I have ever encountered. It is going back to Toshiba but based on the reviews I read I have resigned myself to purchasing another model. Guess witch brand I will be avoiding. I now make a point of when I am in a store that sells computers of going to talk to the sales people and telling them of my Toshiba experience!", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Toshiba satellite was damaged", "Author": "Martha Benavente", "ReviewID": "R38RE586LLB50B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had a bad experience with the Toshiba satellite L855-S5244 because the laptop screen is damaged.

Edges and corners are very smoooth. One of the best Toshiba designs.Package arrived ridiculously fast paying some few more bucks for ship. Came with original box with everything included in it.Regarding to the performance, it is very powerfull indeed. Good job from Toshiba.Maybe hard disk could be larger, but if you use an external drive, you'll have no issue then.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "15.6\" laptop.", "Author": "808TREX50", "ReviewID": "R1ZK46BU1RFMCK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The features is great. Ease of typing on chicklet keys is good. Power Saver plan saves battery power until the public library closes giving me 7 hrs 30 mins of productivity on laptop. Surfing on Chrome browser is a snap. It*s fast and easy. Touchpad should be centerally located in the left corner of laptop. My thumbs would accidently hit pad instead of spacebar thus moving the cursor elsewhere. Installed a wireless mouse...problem solved. I would recommend this product to anyone.", "Date": "December 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer, for a great price!", "Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "R2K14W4YLYO5AQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my aunt (she really wanted a computer, but i convinced her a laptop was better for her needs) and she absolutely loves it. Its not too heavy, the screen is HUGE and the webcam is really clear. Its also really fast (probably because she hasn't put anything on it yet) and I got it for under $500 on here. I went through the computer before i gave it to her, and everything felt comfortable (the keyboard and the mouse pad). I definitely recommend this to everyone - Toshiba's a great brand anyway.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba - Horrible Customer Support", "Author": "Hande \"Hande\"", "ReviewID": "R3NHAPOR5YJTJO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have a three years old Toshiba Satellite L505. About 6 months ago the battery died so I replaced it. About a month ago, I lost sound - completely.I called their customer support and a kind representative told me I had a virus and it was manipulating my computer (he looked like he knew what he was talking about - he had no doubt so I trusted him). Since my warranty had expired, they asked me to pay $50 and than they told me to get a back up for everything I had because my laptop had to be reset again. I paid the $ 50 and bought external harddrive, copied everything to it and called their customer support again. They walked me through for setting up my computer again which is they get rid of everything and bring it back to when you first bought it.I did evrything as told. Next day, I turned on my computer and I still had no sound. So I called them again and they said \" PROBABLY IT WAS NOT A VIRUS BUT THE SPEAKERS WERE NOT WORKING\". So they were wrong and they made me do all those unnecessarily. Okay, mistaked happen, they are human but here is the part that makes me really upset and makes them a really horrible customer service. They said they will not be returning my money as their service is just diagnostic! I could not beleive what I heard because first of all they could not diagnose it correctly - it is still not diagnosed. Second of all diagnostic means determining the causes of problems but they walked me through deleting everything in my computer because of their wrong diagnose. They take no responsibility. I tried to find a email address to inform them of what happened to me and they have none!My Toshiba was one of those diaposable laptops, for two years it was fine but after that it started failing. And the Toshiba Customer service is not a good customer service. Just try to pay more and get a better computer, I think companies like this try to make us accept that the life of these things are short and so we keep buying new ones. They ruining our budgets and even worse the earth. Please think twice before you buy their junk as I regret it,  just pay a little more, buy a better brand that can be used for a long time with a decent customer service. It will better for your budget and your nerves in the long run.", "Date": "September 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "beware of toshiba", "Author": "Rhae \"Rhae\"", "ReviewID": "R22BANLDJ6XZGL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "BEWARE OF TOSHIBA!

You know the look, sympathy, don't get used to your new laptop, you will not have it that long...Boy were they ever right...I returned for repair and when I finally got back it worked... for a few weeks.  Then there it was again.. the BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH!  Once again, I returned for repair....This time I got it back and it has worked for a few months... until now... It happened again...
