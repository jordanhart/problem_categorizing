If you want to game on your computer, don't buy this. It lags on the lowest quality games ever(minecraft, brick force, etc.). Some games, I can't even use the menu. The MENU lags. The processor is only 2.30 ghz, and it SUCKS. I am going to buy a gaming PC, and use this for school. It's fine if you don't care about performance.", "Date": "November 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product", "Author": "Leo", "ReviewID": "R3BNKV73VZWV3Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm pleased with the laptop that I just purchased.

It works very fast and the keyboard and the mouse work quickly too. The laptop is small so even when my desk is messy I am able to fit the laptop on there. I would recommend Acer laptops to anyone that is looking for one. Great laptop!! Thanks ACER!", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good value and does what I need it to do.", "Author": "J. Stjernstrom", "ReviewID": "RWB7BBBKGW2BN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's a replacement for my 5-year-old Dell B130 which takes 6 minutes to boot and gives me a blue screen and says I have a \"kernel\" problem when I try to defragment or backup or write a mirror image to my external hard drive with Western Digital software. I figured it was time to get a replacement before the whole thing crashed.  My computer needs are very simple; email and surf the internet, no heavy duty stuff.  The Acer is about 1/3rd thinner than my Dell.  Looks good.  The mesh black softens the plastic shine. It is an economy box.  If I ever dropped it I think it would shatter, but I use it like a desktop, seldom moving it.  I like the ability to make backup disks.  Wish I had them for my Dell.  So I got 2.3 Gh processor, 3 gig of ram, and 320 gig hard drive and upgrade to Windows 7 for less than $400 delivered to my front door.  Seems like a fair deal to me.  We'll see how it holds up over the long haul.  So far I'm happy.", "Date": "July 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "LAPTOP GOOD BUY!", "Author": "triedit", "ReviewID": "R2YKXM2DRH57JM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My netbook Acer Aspire One was on the way out.  I looked to Best Buy, Wal-Mart, for a replacement.  Found this one at Amazon.  The unit was bigger then the netbook, also it had been where everyone could touch, feel, play and whatever you do to a display laptop.  The price was right, the advertisement told all and we purchased it.  Glad I did!  No problems, been four weeks on the road with us as we deliver trucks and motor homes all across USA.  Ad said there was some scratches, and marks, have not found them yet??better safe then sorry.  Good Buy!", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Acer Laptop", "Author": "Jacqueline Hartman", "ReviewID": "R328SWV74M7J49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very good computer for the price.  Very clear and bright screen even on battery.  Good sized keys make for ease of use and the ten key keypad is a must for me with the work I do.  Light weight enough for me to carry easily.  Battery life could be better but I get about four hours on each charge.
