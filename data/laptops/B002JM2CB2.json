I didn't give it 5 stars simply because I do not believe everything is perfect.It operates well at speed for my relatively simple needs, and is complete with OS for a very reasonable price. Even the battery has a little life in it .. it is good for about an hour.  I bought it to replace a Lenovo laptop that I have had for years, and relied upon until it had a disagreement with a glass of tea.I had no trouble downloading and installing a few reliable programs like Firefox, Thunderbird, Chrome, and Winamp. I had a little trouble with the wireless, but it was my problem, not a problem with the machine.The only problem that I foresee is with the power cable. It doesn't have a sturdy center post like others i have seen.

For the money, the little flaws of a refurbished computer are worth the tradeoff if you find a good seller.

I have to buy a new battery and the keys stick a little, ( quite common if over 3 years old).  I use a supplemental keyboard and plug it in because I don't like the flatness of laptops anyway.The seller was helpful too and recommended some products to go with and even provided a bag!

I decide to install Kaspersky internet security (which I highly recommend you buy for any computer)  because I want it to last. Okay, protected good I think now to install Itunes, online games , and the program for my homework. None will install... Error message hardrive full. Okay delete stuff like pictures that come preloaded and things I won't use. Again error message the same one hard drive full. yes I know I'm trying to free up space. try to delete different stuff... ERROR HARD DRIVE FULL. What does that mean?Obviously this is unlikely to happen to you most refurbished laptops are great but besides that this one has other problems. Java not installed when you recieve normally not a big deal but I had that problem where I couldn't put anything besides Kaspersky. Internet is slow running, and I have superb wifi.
