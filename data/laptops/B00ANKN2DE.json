The palm rest detection setting made it so it would sometimes not register my clicks, but after shutting that off, the thing works fine!Overall this is one of the nicest laptops I have ever owned, and would easily recommend it to anyone looking for a ultra-powerful ultrabook. This thing is light, looks sexy, feels very well built, and is extremely fast!", "Date": "June 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop So Far", "Author": "Cindy Lehrer", "ReviewID": "R2Q2XBZ2NM3LFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop seems to be working wonderfully so far. It's screen is crystal clear, with a 1080p display. The processor is nice, too, running on a 3rd generation i7 Intel processing chip. I really love the way the keyboard is laid out as well. Can't complain much about this product, except that it lacks some inputs and ports that could've been convenient. However, I don't think that this is a major flaw of the device, as one could simply purchase a USB Hub for a cheap price. Also, the reviewers complained that the laptop is flawed because it lacks touchscreen capabilities. I don't really find this to be too big of an issue, though.", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "useing it last 7 months", "Author": "bk.studio", "ReviewID": "RTQ7L6UZM9VJP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's best laptop i ever had.
