I am a big HP guy and this laptop was totally what I wanted for the price.  I love how it has a solid black finish and not that cheap silver paint that chips away over time.  It has good memory and runs off windows 8, and it even has an HDMI outlet to connect to your TV.  Set up was a piece of cake!**For those that are a little confused with the MS Windows 8 style desktop....  if you click the bottom LEFT corner of your desktop,  you will bring up the Windows logo,  right click and scroll to the bottom of the options and you will see 'Desktop',  click that and you can change your laptop to the old school traditional type desktop background with the desktop icons and such and your desktop will stay in that mode unless you change it back to the new Windows style.

It came in with no scratches, knowing that the laptop was used. Windows 8 was hard to understand at first. Although I got the hang of it. PERFECT for college. Gaming  is 4 out of 5.  Worth the price. So far so good!", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very happy with purchase", "Author": "Blessed to Bless \"Carole\"", "ReviewID": "RXRRWQG5LLEV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This experience is turning out to be quite enjoyable. At first it seemed completely confusing, but with a little experimenting, it has turned into quite an adventure.I am very happy with my new laptop, with windows 8.1,  and am finding that it is making learning so much more easy and fun.I'm guessing that I have had this around 45 days now, and have already learned so much more about computers than I ever had with my PC.", "Date": "April 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Teach an old dog!", "Author": "Bob", "ReviewID": "RVR2RVU2R40N2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop met ALL my expectations. I contemplated a tablet but I love the programs associated with a laptop better than apps. The only negative, which really isn't negative, is going from Windows Vista to Windows 8. It's a bit of a jump for this older dog to learn. Shipper was accurate on the description of this product. Shipping was as promised.
