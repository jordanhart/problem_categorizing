The brands included Gateway, Emachine, Pbell, Asus, Dell, Toshiba etc. and a beloved Sony Vaio.In my opinion, I have always thought Sony screens were superior to other brands (with the exception of Apple of course) the screen quality has always been very important to me, and again Sony excels. The screen is simply, stunning.I was concerned with ordering online, a pink laptop. I was worried the color would be too loud.  The color is perfect! It is not loud at all; it is a very soft cotton candy pink.The laptop feels solid. It is also not a super heavy or bulky laptop, but also not as thin as an ultabook. It has a thin lid that keeps it somewhat light.I love the soft glow from the keyboard. I often like to sit at night with only a few candles burning and the TV and fireplace on, playing on my laptop and this feature fits perfectly into my life style.I also love the speedy start up feature. Never saw anything like it. You can shut the laptop totally down, lift the lid and in a few seconds you are ready to go.Windows 8 has some strange features; example a swipe with your mouse from the top of the screen to the bottom closes your program. I also spent more than a few minutes looking for the X to close programs and looking for the non existing start button.  But overall I like Windows 8.The laptop itself is very speedy. I watched a few HD movies on netflex and they ran perfectly with no lag. I also like to play online Facebook games etc., again the speed was lighting fast.I can't comment on the battery, because I almost never unplug my laptop so this feature is not important to me.The price is a very good value. I didn't want to spend over $500.00 since I normally replace my laptop every few years. I saw this pc listed for $60.00 bucks more and went the extra mile. I am so glad I did.I also love Amazon. I have been a member with Amazon since they started back in the 90's. I have never had any issues at all with Amazon. I also knew if I was not satisfied or happy, Amazon would, as they always do take care of me. So I was very confident placing my order.What I don't like about this laptop, nothing. I totally love it!Sony VAIO E15 Series SVE15124CXP 15.5-Inch Laptop (Pink)", "Date": "November 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it!", "Author": "L.

It arrived on time and I had it set up on no time. Wasn't sure if I would like Windows 8, but it works well for me and it didn't take long to get the hang of the new start menu tiles.

I love the backlight keyboard for working in the dark.The rapid wake is so awesome, close the laptop lid and it goes to sleep, open it back up and it loads up everything in a matter of seconds!The 15.5 inch is perfect, it's not too big and its not too small (hence includes the numeric keypad).I'm also into gaming a bit, (not like super intense hardcore gaming where the fps has to be at least 30) but this laptop gets done with what I want it to.An added bonus is the Imagination Studio, I love editing videos together and my desktop has gotten so old (2004) and lost so much space, that it hasn't been able to get the job done, with Sony Vegas I can do all that.Now the cons:The webcam.... is god awful, they advertise HD but its max output is 1MP, so you're better off hooking up a different webcamThe touchpad is also really sensitive and hard to get used to, especially with Windows 8 and that new formatMy laptop came with part of the plastic backing loose and very fragile looking so I'm hoping a quick fix with super glue will help that EDIT: Nope it snapped back into place!So yeah, there aren't really many that issues with it all! I'm not really into Windows 8, but I figured I'd have to learn it eventually, and yeah, it's definitely going to take me a while. I already have a webcam to my desktop so I'm going to see how well that looks. Also I'm buying a mouse because in general, laptop touch pads and I just dont really agree, and just so you know USB mice work just fine if you don't want to splurge on a high priced wireless one. Also if you look on the internet and even Amazon says the battery life is 2.75 hours, don't worry, there are plenty of ways to adjust it, you're more likely to have 3-4 hours of straight web surfing, as for me I'm the type to keep my laptop plugged in for a majority of the time. Fingers crossed it lasts through the next 4 years of college!EDIT MARCH 6, 2013:So that little plastic piece I was talking about, yeah it broke. I glued it and taped it, oh well.Some small cosmetic scratches have also appeared, so I'm looking for a skin cover tooAlso about a month ago, my Windows did an update and had to restart when it got back to the login screen everything froze up, but not exactly, just that I couldn't get my keyboard to work (it wasn't connecting) but the system still was because the clock would change. I eventually had to use the assist function on it (which was working with the keyboard) and do a refresh, which uninstalled all my programs. So safe to say now I'm backing up all installation files.", "Date": "December 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "VAIO is a great product", "Author": "dzinn", "ReviewID": "R3HUZXWIYT0Q7O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We took delivery on a Friday three days after purchase.

It's not an obnoxious pink like many other pink shaded laptops, which is what first drew my interest. The programs that come with this laptop such as Vegas Movie Studio and Acid Music Studio are great as well.I have two problems with this laptop.1) The left/right click mouse buttons are terribly frustrating. It took me awhile to get used to them, and even now they still aggravate me.2) The casing on the side of the laptop seems to be rather poorly put together. Not even three months after buying this laptop brand new, the casing on the side starting coming off and it has gradually gotten worse.EDIT:-Half of the bottom part of my casing has now ripped off completely.-There is a constant white line running down the middle of my screen, indicating I need a new one.Perhaps my laptop was defected when I first got it, but I will never buy a Sony laptop ever again.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed.

Often I click on things and nothing happens. I have to click many times.It also crashes if you try and run too much.I am a photographer and enjoy doing preliminary editing in Windows 7 with the built in color corrector on Windows Photo Editor. It's not available on 8 so I will have to buy lightroom because photoshop is too complex to quickly whip through and crop.I also have had Vaio computers before and consider them a superior product. The Samsung I had was better than this one, out of the box - however I wouldn't get Samsung again as Best Buy didn't want to hear it when it broke.So it's decent, I'm not going to send it back because I need it on a daily basis, but my advice shop around. A laptop should be able to handle Chrome and Photoshop without slowing down. It's not horrible but it's not the $600 Macbook that some of the other reviewers talked about.On the plus side, I got the pink one and it is really fun.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great computer!!!", "Author": "Ursula Rogers", "ReviewID": "R2VT37WCGJNJ61", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful user-friendly computer, I love the soft pink color; Sony did an excellent job, a great computer to have.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "love it!!", "Author": "mary", "ReviewID": "R1NRRXS4EQ179K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "wonderful laptop-love the lighted keypad-I like windows 8-but I also use classic shell--got the silver-but I wish I bought the pink-Great product!!", "Date": "December 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bought for Grandson for Christmas/Graduation", "Author": "sff", "ReviewID": "R1NZ8FLY54QQ15", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "He loves it!

Reading text is almost as crisp as the iPad's retina display.The lighted keyboard is so useful for working in a dimly lit room.  I use the laptop to follow the Bloomberg editors on twitter while looking at the channel on cable tv, sometimes in full darkness.Long life battery allows greater portability.  I was pleasantly surprised to get 5.5 hours of use on battery power at default brightness!This is twice what I had expected as the AMAZON'S PRODUCT DESCRIPTION WRONGLY STATES: 'Up to 2.75 hours of battery life at default brightness with standard 4000 mAh battery'.SEE MY PHOTOS IN CUSTOMER IMAGESThe Sony Vaio E15 laptop has one USB 3.0 port which is x 10 faster than the two standard USB 2.0 ports.The USB 3.0 port is handy for attaching an external drive so that data transfer can be done in a more timely manner.The DVD/CD optical drive's Cyberlink Power2Go software is very user friendly.Sony Vaio updates the computer hardware.  So far all updates have been seamless.A trial version of Microsoft Office 201O was installed on the Windows 8 OSI took advantage of paying for Office 201O  to automatically qualify for the free upgrade to Microsoft Office 2013(I downloaded and installed Microsoft Office 2013 on Friday 2nd February without any hiccups)With 750GB of Hard Disk storage and additional cloud storage on the Microsoft Skydrive, memory should not be an issue even if you're a data hog! :)CONS:Actually this a Microsoft issue rather than Sony's - Mastering Windows 8 is much too steep a learning curve over Windows 7.  So, be prepared to dedicate some time to re-learn this Windows 8 OSMY RECOMMENDATION:If you are pressed for time or, you don't want to 'figure' out how to use Windows 8, I recommend signing up for a crash course in course in 'Learning to Use the Windows 8 Operating System' :(With a 2.4 GHz Intel Core i3-3110M dual-core processor (3 MB cache) and 6 GB of installed DDR3 RAM, this Sony Vaio E15 laptop is adequate for running a small home office.Overall, this  Sony Vaio E15 laptop is a great little workhorse/entertainment device offered here on Amazon at a great price.Hope my review and photos weere helpful ...

She was very happy with it, using it for all her school work.  Then some Windows tiles started to not open and the next day the computer would not start.  Sony support walked me through an alternative way to start the computer and we did a reset back to the original configuration.  This meant I had to reload all the software and files we had added since we bought the computer.Two days later I had the same problem.  This time I told support I wouldn't waste my time on a reset and I demanded a replacement.  They arranged to have a technician come to my home and replace the hard drive.  Again I had to load the programs and files back onto the computer.

If you experience any issues, I recommend that you check any tech forums for possible fixes before you decide to re-send the item to the shipper (if you do no reside in the US).

Its backlit keyboard does not display awkwardly during the day and at night looks perfect for use but does not blind the user. The screen has a crystal clear image. Playing an MMO on it is comparable to what I have seen on higher end laptops that cost in the thousands. The keyboard layout is ideal with shortcut buttons that make sense. This laptop is definitely user friendly. Sony support is excellent. When I ran into an issue with the computer I was able to contact support and they solved the issue within moments. The person I spoke to had no issues understanding me and was quick to provide a clear solution. There is a button on this laptop called the \"ASSIST\" button. I have yet to find all of its usefulness but I do know that it can help with most issues encountered on the computer. The VAIO installed products on this computer are not as intrusive as it is with most other laptops. There are not constant pop ups about the programs and their \"neat\" features that I encountered with other laptops. If you want to use the VAIO programs you can. If not they will not bug you. I do warn Windows 8 is one of the most awkward OS that I have ever seen. It was obviously designed without desktop and laptop use in mind. Since it is designed for a tablet it almost requires a touch screen for convenient use. This laptop does not have one so navigating Windows 8 may be a problem. Once you get used to it Windows 8 can quickly be bypassed for computer use similar to Windows 7. My suggestion is to watch YouTube videos that will explain how to navigate the OS. The speed of the computer is excellent. I played an MMO with no lag through a complex dungeon that almost always lags and glitches my computer. There were no such events. Sometimes when working with Windows 8 it is slow to respond as there is a whole tab system that bogs down the computer. The installation of programs is quick and easy. Also, for anyone who does not want to purchase Microsoft Office products due to their inflated price, there is no longer a Microsoft works already installed on the computer as was with most previous Microsoft OS products. I suggest downloading Open Office which is free but not as efficient as either Office or Works. Overall, this computer is excellent as it provides a user friendly experience. The specifications of the computer are very nice for the price. The features are also very dependable. I highly suggest purchasing this product.PROS:Good selling price for high end computer.Excellent user friendly features such as backlit keyboard and Hi-Def screen.Great speed for most home use programs.Superb customer support.Sleek look and feel.CONS:Windows 8 disappoints.Poor speakers for audio, use headphones or external speakers (not very expensive)", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Picked it for the color & design", "Author": "CnCnMJ", "ReviewID": "R2OP7VC7M0HBU9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The most useful feature is really the backlit keyboard.

Galt \"Forcas\"", "ReviewID": "R12WDBDZ1V3WUY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased a Vaio (specific model number no longer sold) a few months ago. My review is both about Vaio product quality in general, and the Sony customer service/repair process. I am posting it on Vaio products to alert other consumers what customer service level they can expect when they buy a Vaio. The screen on my unit had the backlight fail after a few months of use. I have had Sony repair it three times. Each time they returned it, it still had the same problem. After the third time, I gave up on Sony and purchased a comparable ASUS notebook, which has worked perfectly. The reason why I have given 1/5 stars is because Sony was inefficient, rude, and downright dishonest about their \"repair\" process. Only once out of three times did they get the shipping box, repair process, or return process done in the turnaround time they promised. At no point did they actually repair the laptop! After receiving the still defective laptop back for the third time, I called their service center in Laredo Texas and asked what they had done to repair it. They told me that the internal cable for the screen had never been properly connected, and they plugged it in. I asked if that meant it was repaired, and was told by the representative that they were unable to commit that the laptop had been repaired or would be functional. Out of the 2 months I spent dealing with Sony, this was one of the few honest statements they made: My laptop is still as useless as the day I first called their tech support. I will never purchase another Sony product as a result of this experience, and to anyone that buys a Vaio: Hope that it works perfectly. Otherwise, Sony will take it from you for 12-20 days (not the 10 they promise) and then return it to you still broken -- 3 times in a row.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sonny Laptop windows 8", "Author": "Charles S.

Windows 8 is difficult to navigate but the sensitivity of the mouse makes it next to impossible.

I purchased this for my business so that I would be able to have speed and ease when placing items on my website. When there has been a connectivity problem, it forced me to disconnect the entire house.  I can still use my desktop and other laptops just fine but the Vaio somehow gets disconnected.  I wish I had returned it but i felt I would get used to windows 8 and things would be fine.I am sad to say that I am writing this on my Windows Vista desktop because once again, the Vaio has shut itself off.
