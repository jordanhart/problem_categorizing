I'm a software engineer, so I'm typing all day. I'm coming from a MacBook Pro. The keyboard and trackpad on the X1 Carbon are simply the best; even better than my old ThinkPads. The laptop is thin and light, yet feels very sturdy. The screen is beautiful. I'm using Ubuntu 13.04 on it, and it works quite well. I can get 5 hours of JavaScript development out of the battery pretty easily. <3", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing laptop, but expensive and battery life is not very long.", "Author": "Lior_g", "ReviewID": "RLZ17ZW12KQRV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So - first of all, I got it from my work place. I did not buy it here.However, I had it for a week now and after reading some of the reviews here I felt compelled to add my perspective.This computer is amazing because it is very light and very thin, so it's very easy to carry it around.Hardware is great: i7, 8 gb ram, sizable hard drive.I did not notice the screen resolution issues the other reviews mentioned, so I guess it varies from one person to another.I do agree regarding the track pad, but to be perfectly honest - I have yet to encounter a track pad I liked. If it was up to me, I would get rid of those things all together. Laptop designers - maybe trade it for a detachable wireless mouse?Battery usually lasts for 2.5-3 hours, but also recharge very fast (I estimate it takes less then an hour.)Other issues:The \"enter\" button is right next to the \"'\" key. Good luck typing \"I'm\" in blind typing...You will need accessories to connect to the Ethernet port or VGA port.Bottom line:If you are frequently on the road, but also have access to power outlet every now and then (for example, if you're presenting at the client's location,) and can afford it - this is a great choice.If long battery life is critical for you (for example, you're working outside for long hours - say, at a construction site) then look elsewhere.To conclude: this laptop's deal is \"pay additional $700 and get the weight and width cut down to a third.\" It's up to you to decide if this deal works for you.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smaller screen than what I wanted but the portability makes up for it", "Author": "Bryan Duffy \"duffm,an\"", "ReviewID": "R1XXT357QMO4GQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this computer wanting the performance and got it all the way.  No issues for me so far.  The customer service may not be great but I haven't had to contact them yet.I got used to the screen size reduction from my last computer.  I really enjoy the portability and the great battery life.  It is so light and everyone has been very impressed with it wherever I go.

From fully charged, when you remove the power cord, the battery life indicator starts a fast and steep downward slope.  Even if the computer is just sitting there and not being used, the usable battery life is on the order of 3.5 - 3.75 hours.I thought to get the ultrabook label you had to have 6 hours????", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Miss a 3rd USB port", "Author": "G. S. Pita", "ReviewID": "RBE69U6SQJVHY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great notebook. The screen is not glossy, different from many other Windows PCs at the same price point. When you get used to it the screen happens to be more comfortable to your eyes than a glossy screen.The one thing I miss is a third USB port. I always have a wireless mouse connected, what leave my notebook with only one port left to connect either my external smart card reader, my USB headset or a network cable when I need a more stable connection.I would give it a 5-star rating if it wasn't for this 3rd USB detail.", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not for picky people or people who heavily multi-task with heavy applications", "Author": "Sharon Talbot \"nikkie\"", "ReviewID": "R2PP7YACSTD1OI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The good:- The keyboard is nice.- The size and shape of the laptop is nice.  Compared to other thinkpad models this is a svelte machine.- It is pretty light.- The machine is fast enough for software development.  I haven't bothered to play games on it.- Linux compatibility is good.  Everything worked out of the box, except the fingerprint reader, which I installed a package for, and then it also works fine.The bad:- The screen is really ugly.  I'm not sure whose fault, but I hate it.  It is very \"liney\"?  I suspect the matte cover may be not playing nicely.  It is also pretty dim at its brightest in comparison to other ultrabooks such as the Samsung Series 9.  It's max is 300 nits, while the Samsung's is 400.- Mine shipped with 4GB of memory, which is not enough.  You can't can't can't upgrade it.- The touchpad.  I read Hanselman's complaints but went forward with this model because I don't like bottom buttons on my clickpads.  But honest the touchpad is really finicky and hard to use, and I don't like the texture of it under my fingers.Who should choose this laptop?  People who like Lenovos or want something with known good linux configuration, who don't care about screen resolution or quality, prefer to use a mouse, and use less than 4GB of memory for their daily activities.

It gets a lot of comments on how nice it looks.PROS:-  Fast.-  SSD is great.  Did I mention fast?-  Touch screen is wonderful esp with Windows 8.CONS:-  Screen resolution is not great.  I can see the pixels.  Display looks grainy.-  The touchpad has no tactile feedback.  Left and right button clicks get mixed up.-  Uses a mini display port video connector that many displays don't support.  I have to carry a dongle around to meetings to be able to project.  Kind of takes away from the sleekness.-  Few ports.-  The DC connector on the power brick broke within a few days.Overall I'm not too enthusiastic.", "Date": "June 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "The worst support service ever ...", "Author": "Denis Azria", "ReviewID": "R10OBFUX8K18CJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought one of those in February 2013.In April, a key from the keyboard got broken (by itself, no shock). Lenovo decided to replace the whole keyboard. It took them until July to perform the replacement.Then, just following that replacement, a new problem appeared: each time I reconnect the computer to its external power, it re initializes the internal clock and restarts the machine. In addition, I have a regular \"blue death screen\" with \"Driver Power State Failure\" that also triggers a restart.The problem was reported to Lenovo in August, who promised (like the first time) to intervene within 48 hours.Mid-September: did not hear from them, decided to call.They closed the incident and ask me to re-describe the whole problem (making money from my phone call), when I complained about this process, they simply hanged-up on me.Bottom line: if you buy a Lenovo computer, do not expect the basic hardware support they promise, but a lot of time wasting and payment on their support line, for non existing service.Not buying one ever again.Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 14-Inch Touchscreen Laptop (Black)3444CUU", "Date": "September 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Bad Boy is Super Light But Follows Latest Lenovo Trends (unfortunately)...", "Author": "David Rounick  Philadelphia PA \"Greatest Poke...", "ReviewID": "R19WYV2760WRC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me first say that I consider ThinkPad's to be the Windows (PC) laptop / notebook leader and I have been using them since birth (few days after).  I'm in IT located in Philadelphia region and purchase approx 50 PCs per year for clients.  If you're used to the \"old\" ThinkPad keyboards which even Mac users will tell ya, were simply unbeatable -- the Lenovo Carbon X1 is NOT in the same vein.  Nearly all the new Lenovo laptops now follow the crappy \"separate key\" approach to keyboards.  Quite honestly, they're terrible and if it ain't broke...now their keyboard is pretty much the same you get with every other laptop.  Maybe a bit better but NOT what you're expecting if coming from an older X or T series Thinkpad.  That's important because as one reviewer stated, \"The keyboard and trackpad on the X1 Carbon are simply the best; even better than my old ThinkPads\" -- I totally disagree.  Even the \"eraser head\" (little red trackpoint used as a mouse that's been on Thinkpads since I can remember) is weak -- it's flatter and lower than what you're expecting if you've become an expert with a ThinkPad and love the ability to touch type with your fingers NEVER leaving the keyboard.  It's really sad (like the Blackberry got rid of the \"wheel\" years ago) that these companies don't have the courage to stand-by superior design -- as they're worried about being different and it affecting the bottom line.  Ironically, it's so inexpensive to actually offer two keyboard options -- they could go that route, but that's for another post.The X1 is solid but does need tweaking.  The power settings are awful -- so if you're seeing a \"gray\" low-lit screen -- go to max power immediately -- even when running on batteries.  You'll get approx 3 hours on batteries even with max performance -- and you can use their \"Battery Stretch\" feature when it starts to hit lower levels.  The screen is good -- ain't amazing -- but more than adequate -- especially considering this thing is amazingly light.  You've got to keep this key point in mind.  This is a 14 inch (not 13.3, not 12, not 11 -- but 14\") laptop -- try to find one this light at 14 inches -- so let's compare apples to apples here.  Don't forget that point -- and quite honestly, why else would you buy the Carbon X1 if weight wasn't at the top of your list?  You want a performance powerhouse / desktop replacement -- you go with their W series.  You want inexpensive but Thinkpad performance and reliability, you go with the T series.  You can get a refurb'd or sale unit for as little as $500+ in fact recently I purchased a T510 for less than $600 and it screamed -- plus has the older (better) keyboard.Key Points:2 USB ports, one on each side -- USB 3.0No optical drive -- you'll need to get a USB DVD drive (I got the Samsung on Amazon:  http://astore.amazon.com/rdkint-20/detail/B00DBV28TG)There's video out for your needs:HDMIMiniDP...and video camera:  1.3MP - 720P (with mute function)The keyboard has other issues -- top right is the biggest weakness.  The Home/Delete/End buttons are poorly placed.Trackpad is fine and positioning of left and right click buttons is solid -- what you'd expect.The unit doesn't sit well when on an uneven (even slightly) surface -- the 4 \"feet\" could be more flexible and \"give more\" -- would be nice feature -- otherwise the laptop is wobbling -- important in terms of lighter laptops because the extra weight in more conventional units makes up for this issue.Performance is solid but I did notice some stuttering -- I needed to tweak the operating system settings as well as power settings.Overall you're buying this for the weight -- and it doesn't disappoint -- in terms of weight vs power/features, etc. -- this is a 9+.  But don't expect the performance of a high-end T or W-series Thinkpad.I would like to see a 15\" unit with a bit more weight because all these vendors are ignoring the power users that need more screen real estate -- but it'll come.  Asus is leading the way along with Samsung and Lenovo typically is a follower -- like IBM, when they owned the brand -- they were never early adopters once in \"cash cow\" mode.  Lenovo is the same although sometimes they surprise you.Hopefully they will, but until they bring back or offer the keyboard that should have never left their line -- I will always consider other brands such as Asus, Dell, Toshiba, Mac, etc.  Unlike desktops, one simple recommendation -- wait as long as you can before putting heavy cash into a laptop -- remember, smaller means slower and more expensive compared to a desktop unit.  This laptop will be $800 bucks a year from now -- so keep that in mind.Hope this helps!", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F43SF0A"}}
