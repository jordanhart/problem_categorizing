Let me tell you that is by far the fastest laptop I have ever used.  It handles most games with ease at full graphics.That being said there is a major flaw with this laptop.  Within 2 months of owning the laptop, the keys started popping off.  Dell does have a picture tutorial on how to put this keys back on, but if you follow the tutorial it will often lead to adjacent keys popping off.  And if you push too hard when trying to get the keys to latch, then you are out of luck.  Luckily my first experience with Alienware customer service ended in a keyboard replacement in less than 2 days from calling tech support.  However when it started happening again tech support was not that helpful.  I was told I would need to purchase a replacement keyboard for $110!  The laptop is under warranty for 4 more months.  I was even considering extending the warranty.My suggestion is to use the built in keyboard as little as possible.  I use a logitech keyboard now, my biggest issue is now the laptop does not really travel easily anymore.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Warning, major issues, and lack of customer service", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "RCDD8MWIFRZKU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought an Alienware M17x in November of 2011, I loaded it up with a total cost of $5750. By March I expirenced power issues. The power adapter is plugged in but the system does not recognize the adapter. This causes the CPU to throttle back and run very slow. Dell has trouble shooted the problem over the phone, sent a technician out to replaced the mother board and adapter 5 times now. The problem still exists. They refuse to refund my money or exchange the system. Customer support says it is against policy to exchange unless I have the 4 repairs done within 30 days. Them being slow to dispatch technicians prevents 30 day policy to work in my favor. I did pay for the exteneded priemer warranty, which is now apparent to me that this was also a waste of my money.

I agree that the reflective screen is an issue if taken outside or played by a window, but I have no problems with it inside, and usually play at night anyway, don't most gamers? So for looks I give a 5 star review as well, the keyboard lighting themes you can set to match your mouse or background and its very eye-catching and fun.Now for the part which gets the 0 star review that made me select the 3 star total...I bought through Dell, and while the warranty period lasted, it was fine.Rather than having to send it in, they walked me through popping off the touch sensitive panel where the volume controls and eject button etc are when it arrived and they didn't work. I dislike the fact that you have to use a thin screwdriver or other hard/sharp object to pry off a panel made of softish plastic but that's the price you pay for not having visible screws. It was easy enough to replug the tiny connection that had wiggled loose and then snap the plastic back into place, and the problem was solved, for a few months, until putting it down when done using it eventually caused it to wiggle free again. But knowing what had happened the first time I didn't even have to call and wait on hold, just fixed it myself in 10 minutes, this has happened a few more times since then, always with the same fix.I did have it stop registering the charger as other people have mentioned, but all I was told to do was remove the charger, remove the battery and wait 30 seconds for any residual power to dissipate and then put it all back together. Which basically reset it and fixed the issue. I have had to do this a few times since as well but it always fixes it.The drivers on the CD are a good starting point for reinstalling WIndows, but they lack good descriptions for anyone not into building their own computers, so finding updated ones online can be fun. The ones on the Dell website are a joke. There are new video card drivers for my 285M on the Nvidia website from within the last month, but the ones specific to the Alienware, which does make a difference, are only as recent as 2010...If you try to install the ones from Nvidia you will get an error telling you that no eligible hardware is found... even though your card is listed in the description. Its because the way Alienware sets up the system requires custom drivers so your card actually has a slightly different ID than the standard ones and that specific ID isn't listed in the standard driver programming. If you want the latest you will end up spending a few hours doing you tube video watching and forum searching to find the solution which involves rewriting a portion of the driver files to include your model ID, then doing it again to include the basic third video card that is installed along with the 2 running in SLI, and then going into your BIOS and disabling the Hybrid SLI and the Integrated Graphics so that the computer will recognize the SLI cards and not try to run off of the basic card instead. Then you go into your video card control panel and tell it to use the SLI again... And then it works beautifully.If you are into building your own computer and working on it yourself, these systems are great. I wouldn't trade mine in, I love this beast, but I also know that for a beginning techno geek or someone who needs simple maintenance only devices, this would be one of the biggest headaches ever.

I must say I am highly impressed with the machine.  I would not be returning this if the newer model was not released.  The machine is quick and powerful and battery life is surprisingly good for a gaming laptop (got about 3 1/2 hours battery life without gaming, which would probably get better once the battery was broken in).  It allows you to convert to integrated graphics instead of dedicated which also increases battery life.  Another cool feature allows you to change the backlight keys (in sections) on the keyboard.  If this was only $700 or $800 I would probably not bother returning for the newer version, however considering this is almost $1,500, I would like to have the newest model (considering it is less than $100 more for the newer model).

Current M17x R4 has better components, lower cost.", "Author": "niels", "ReviewID": "R2KBB4I33TGJ5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Going by various reviews from reputable sites on the net, the Alienware M17x models are not as lousy about overheating every hour, like Alienware laptops used to be. I still have the top-of-the-line model from 2003 and its an absolutely useless PoS.As for the M17x, its not that loud in regular operation, but can get quite loud if you run demanding games on it.The 2 star rating is not related to this being the old model, even though the 'discount' doesn't come close to making up for getting old components, especially since the new model's base configuration has a lower price. As usual, you can't buy hard drive or memory upgrades directly through Dell, unless you want to pay double.The 2 star rating is for the absolutely cheesy plastic pane mounted in front of the display:The quality of this plastic is thicker but not one bit better than what is used in throw-away, see-through product packaging.It is extremely reflective, soft and sensitive to scratches.  Any light source behind you turns this notebook into a very expensive make-up mirror. It makes the pricing of this notebook look absurd, no matter what they stuffed inside, its such a glaring flaw.At this price level, we can expect a nice pane of Gorilla glass, like Apple puts on all their notebooks.  And Apple thankfully puts anti-reflective coating on their glass too.Making matters worse is that while the display is decent, its brightness is not strong enough to overcome the reflections.  Alienware managers should really pull their heads out of their sand and fix this sorry annoyance on an otherwise good notebook.I haven't had any problems with the keyboard, but its Texas-rough, lacks the kind of polish you find on high end Logitech keyboards.  Its like comparing Chevrolet interior materials to Audi interior materials.  People who spend most of their time handling pitchforks may of course be oblivious to such differences.  Dell laptops have always looked like they were made for people with coarse hands and coarse perceptions.  Though they've been trying for better design the last few years, only their new carbon cased ultrabook can be called an all around success in the look and feel department.  The Alienware notebook design is really pretty good, cause its honest and doesn't try to somehow look slimmer than it is.  Just wish they'd show as much attention to detail to the most important thing on a notebook: the screen you're supposed to stare at while using it.", "Date": "June 24, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006LX2Q6G"}}
