{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Thin, light and good screen. Mediocre battery life, funky WiFi and BT. Typing is miserable and frustrating.", "Author": "Peter in McLean \"PeterK\"", "ReviewID": "R1S7JV3G6KBOTU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had the S7-391 with 4Gb RAM and a 256 GB SSD for about 6 months, having paid a lot more for it when it first came out. I can recommend it, but only if you understand the limitations and problems with the machine. Here's a quick summary of my experience to date:GoodIt's very thin and very light. The screen has excellent resolution and reasonably responsive touch capabilities. Since it turns itself on when you open it, you need to actually shut it down to (carefully) clean the screen. it uses an SSD and never shuts itself off unless you force it to shut down, it comes up quite fast and is ready to go. It's even fast on a cold boot, like most SSD systems.That's mostly it for the good.Not GoodUntil recently, the WiFi would just stop connecting and I'd need to manually reconnect to my router or an AP at work. Bluetooth would also get wiggy and stop communicating, particularly after a modest pause in activity. This was such a regular \"feature\" with the included BT mouse that I had to search out one that would work better. Never found one, though the Logitech BT travel mouse works more often than not.Battery life is also not good. Running the screen at around 80% gives me about three hours or a bit more. Dimming down to 50% gives me five hours and change, but given the  level of eye strain it feels more like 8 hours. On the other hand, the brick isn't too  large and packs easily into a briefcase of bag.The BadMan but I hate - HATE - typing on  this thing. Sure, all ultrabooks/Macbook Air have \"Chiclet\" type keyboards, and maybe the Aspire isn't particularly worse than most, but it sure feels that way. I am normally an extraordinarily fast and accurate typist, but on this machine I may be better off using hunt & peck. Trying to put any speed on my typing results in doubled letters every other word or so, or dropped letters. The ratio is about 4 doubled letters for each dropped letter. Only by slowing way, way down can I get an entire sentence out without correcting it, something that just doesn't happen when I use the standard keyboard on my desktop tower.As somebody who writes and edits a great deal, I have actually decided to get some other machine, perhaps a Lenovo, and just figure the Aspire is a sunk cost. But if thin and light is more important to you than keyboarding, then it's worth considering.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beautiful, light computer but Acer Quality Control is terrible.", "Author": "tungty", "ReviewID": "R2HU61RJX6H19A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This would be a 5-star review if it were not for the manufacturing quality issues. I ordered model 6410 from the Microsoft online store for my wife's b-day at the end of April for $999.  It arrived with a 2 inch pixel scratch (subsurface in the screen) and it also had a manufacturing date of Nov 2012, which by computer standards is practically ancient at 6 months old. Microsoft returns are a nightmare but I finally did get a full refund. Fortunately Amazon lowered their price at this time and our 2nd buy was this slightly newer 6468 version manufactured Jan 20, 2013 (whoever names the models must be on crack - go to their website if you don't believe me). The Microsoft store in the mall now carries the 6413 which I think might be newer for  $999.Anyway, #2 from Amazon arrived with a bad space key. You had to mash the Space key very hard to get it to work if it worked at all so back it went. Amazon prime shipping and returns are a breeze though which is why I love Amazon so much. The 3rd computer arrived in this time in perfect working condition - 3rd time's a charm as they say.Many oohs and ahs at work meetings on the size and styling. Admittedly the styling is very Mac-like but it's thinner, touch screen and compatible with all of my PC programs for work and home. Honestly though, I find the touch screen pretty useless on a laptop/ultrabook. If it folded back, like a tablet it would be a perfect design.Sounds like it should be a 2-star review but really this thing is so light and sexy and nothing came close to matching it in May 2013. It's the best 'laptop' I've owned so far ( and I've had HP, Sony, Toshiba, and the worst of the worst my current Dell Aspire 'aka \"brick\" or \"P.o.S\" for work that I no longer carry - it now stays docked 24-7).", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great device!", "Author": "Julio Perez", "ReviewID": "R2W94ZVV3L452Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly as described!

Most of the reviews were quite accurate. It's a very light, very pretty, very well-built laptop with an ok battery life. When running large processes i.e. games, the fan can get a bit loud and the area just above the keyboard where I presume the battery is can get a bit hot, but otherwise it is more or less silent and cool.A note about battery life: I'm getting up to 5 hours running internet/documents, and around 2 hours running League of Legends. This is with all settings optimized for power saving and wi-fi turned on. With wi-fi turned off i.e. airplane mode, I can get 6 to 7 hours.The speakers work quite well, as does the touchscreen. Thanks to the SSD, boot time from completely shut down to the lock screen is slightly less than 5 seconds. This is an excellent laptop for its price. I could not find it for less elsewhere.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very disappointing", "Author": "Rev", "ReviewID": "R1CYHY70XPLRNA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After living with the Aspire S7 for 5 months, I cannot recommend it to anyone except perhaps my worst enemies.At first I was excited about its light weight, and its stylish form factor. But I have since learned that these come at way too high a cost.The keyboard is basically unusable. Because the laptop is so thin, there's almost no key travel, which means keystrokes are often missed or accidentally doubled. After five months I still have not found a way to be accurate typing on this thing. The touchpad is also tricky, though I'm not sure what causes it to be so.Out of the box, the wireless is a serious mess. Major issues getting connected to a most of the different networks I use, and I'm still not confident that I've got it squared away.Also, it seems minor, but has been a big issue: the placement of the power button on the side is exactly where you would put your hand to pick it up. So I'm always accidentally turning it off when I want to shift in my seat. Seriously, I turned it off while writing this review.I went with an Acer rather than an HP in the hopes that the machine wouldn't be bogged down with bloatware. Sadly, this is not the case. Acer has all of their own tools they'd like me to be using; who knows how many conflicts they cause with Windows 8. I did eventually uninstall some Acer app that seems to have fixed a persistent crash, but it took a long time to troubleshoot.The touchscreen has so much glare, I find myself twisting and turning in an attempt to find a position where it can be seen.And, it's a small thing, but it only comes with one charger - evidently an uncommon charger as it took me forever to find a backup. None of the chargers on Amazon seem to actually fit it, so I had to buy it directly from Acer.So the only time I like this laptop is when it is turned off, and in my backpack. Any other time it is a source of constant frustration and diminished productivity.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Ultrabook", "Author": "Stephen.H", "ReviewID": "R1QVK6SAVCD0SU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great design, really beautiful.

It does pretty much anything you'll need it to without problem, and it looks FANTASTIC,There are a few cons:1) The battery life isn't amazing. At about 3-4 hours, you can find better, but it's adequate.2) It doesn't have a standard HDMI port, just a mini-HDMI, requiring you but another cord. This isn't a huge deal, and I can see why it's necessary (a regular HDMI might not have fit on the super slim tray)3) The keyboard is understandably thin, so the keys don't have a lot of travel (that is, they don't push down very far). This will result in a few misspellings, but I am getting used to it.These cons are absolutely not deal breakers, and I think anybody would be very happy to own this laptop.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Slim,light and fast but WAY TOO LOUD", "Author": "Muhammed Fahim Tariq", "ReviewID": "RUJY2UKTHZ698", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Super light and Super slim...boots up fast too.

Small in size, thin and lightweight, back lit keyboard and fast.We're getting about 3-4 hours of average use before plugging it in. Not a huge issue since we're never than far from an outlet.It also came with a Bluetooth mouse that requires no dongle, which is nice. I just installed the batteries and turned it on, and instantly had a mouse.The only downsides to this laptop are:Windows 8 is atrocious. I'm sure after using it a little we'll be able to navigate, but would have liked Windows 7 better.Keyboard is very thin and therefore lacks the tactile feedback that I would like. Again just takes some getting used to.Power button is in a strange place (on left side next to USB, power plugs). When handling the sides, the power button is occasionally pressed. Not sure why it wasn't placed above the keyboard like most laptops.Overall, it's a very nice laptop and we have no regrets about buying it.
