I tried calling technical support and they I must have spent an hour on three different occasions and still not resolved the issue. This has to be hands down the worst computer I have ever owned and I owned an emachines that was rated as top ten worst computers ever made!

It was made for tablet-type products and is a complete, utter disaster for laptop and desktop applications.  I am a long-time heavy user of Windows products and, ironically, believe Windows 7 one of the best operating systems anywhere.  Windows 8 is more than frustrating, it is infuriating.  And don't think you can buy a computer with Windows 8 then just have Windows 7 installed as several close friends say this doesn't always work.  Your best bet is to buy a computer with Windows 7 already installed or go to Apple.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just awful!", "Author": "Christy Sanders", "ReviewID": "RB2YW5CHNORMG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had it 11 months and now it goes off and on when working on it.
