This laptop works great, no complaints so far. The price for this laptop is actually a steal with how fast the processor is. My mom bought one as well (her first laptop). I will update my review later if any problems arise and/or if my mom has anything to add.Pros: Boots super fast (like SUPER FAST), lightweight (I carry it to class with me), Windows 8 is actually very easy to use once you get the hang of it (even the most computer illiterate person could figure it out), I LOVE the number pad as wellCons: None yetSound Quality: It's loud enough for a laptop. I actually find the sound pretty efficient, but don't expect any \"super bass\" or anything.But once again, this would be the perfect laptop for you, especially if you don't want to go buy an expensive MacBook.", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Deal", "Author": "Veil_Lord", "ReviewID": "R3R5QLB3WNHNAX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The computer feels solid.  There's no latch to keep the screen down when it's close, but if you're careful that's probably not a big deal.  Don't lift directly in the middle of the lid though, that's where the camera is.  It does attract dust and fingerprints like a magnet, but whether you'll care or not is personal preference.  According to the sticker on the front, it actively tries to run your battery in charge cycles to prolong life, which assuming they do a good job of it is an awesome feature.  Just a note, you'll have to go into power options and click Dell Extended Battery Life options.The first thing you should do after you've set up the computer, is restart and press F12 before and as the Dell logo is coming up.  Then choose diagnostics and test the system thoroughly.  It'll take maybe 30-40 minutes, but it's well worth it.  Then go into the My Dell application and stress test it again.  Then do it again once a week or so.  Your goal is to either fry the thing, so you're replaced rightfully so during warranty, or see that the system is rock solid and you're probably fine.  You won't void any warranties, the Dell software specifically says it won't damage your hardware; if something gives out it's defective.  DO NOT WAIT until you're close to or out of warranty to perform tests!The DVD drive is about as cheaply constructed as they come.  It looks very fragile and I wouldn't bet on it for a whole lot of use, however given a lot of video and games are digital now, it may not be a big deal.  According to the Backup Media creation software, it burns at 2x so it's quite slow, but then again it's a cheap laptop.Backup Media - The backup media is not included; the software that creates it is awful.  It ate two of my DVDs, failing both times, and took some time to hunt a solution online.  Apparently they shipped it glitched so often times it will create the first disk, taking 20-30 minutes to do so, then fail on the second.  You can alternatively backup to a USB drive.  It appears as if they don't limit you to burning only one copy of backup media, which is one reason I got fed up and left HP.  Tip: update the Dell backup software before you try to make backup DVDs or it'll just ruin DVD after DVD and fail every time.Keyboard - The keyboard is slightly eschew.  To accommodate the number pad, things are just slightly off, so if you're a touch typist you'll probably be slightly off center when you first try it.  The touchpad was responsive and the buttons had a satisfying click.Windows 8 - It's abysmal and makes everything harder than it needs to be.  Dell did thankfully include a couple of videos to at least let you see how to turn the machine off.  Hint: it's needlessly stupid and annoying.  Move mouse to upper right of screen, then the \"charms\" appear and you can find it.  Alternatively, you can do Ctrl+Alt+Delete and find the power button in the lower right corner.  I'm strongly considering dual booting to Unbutu Linux.  However, it has improved a bit since the 8.1 update and I'm still just thankful to not be running Windows Vista.Heat/Fans - The laptop fan is very quiet.  You can feel a lot of heat radiating off the keypad when the machine is doing a stress test, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing.  A good laptop case should dissipate heat easily.  My only real concern in this arena is that it doesn't look very easy to blow dust out of the machine as it accumulates.  They should have designed it with that in mind.USB Ports - The USB ports and the power supply are all on the sides of the machine.  Three are on the left side along with the cord and one on the right.  I'd rather have had one in the back, because it's a little too crowded if a USB plug is fat.  I'm finding it difficult to nail down, with several websites having conflicting information, but from the icons next to the ports it looks like 1 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0 on the left and 1 USB 2.0 on the right side.Memory Card Reader - There's a multi-card reader located annoyingly in the front which you can easily miss if you don't know to look for it.  Still, better to have it than not, but I wish they'd included some sort of cover for it for when it's not in use.The picture in the webcam is not crystal clear by definitely OK; you will want to have some light in the room you're using at or it'll look really bad though.  There is also an integrated microphone, which is a little scary really since some viruses can turn both on.  I'm probably paranoid, but I'm going to put a small bandage over the camera when I'm not using it.  As long as you're close, the sound quality on the microphone is just fine for video conferencing.All in all, very decent machine for the money.  I'll have to try it out with some games, but so far it's looking very promising I'll be using it for many years.---Update 8-12-13---I tried it with Saint's Row 2 and the game is virtually unplayable, but that's just because it's a horribly poorly coded game.  The laptop can handle the graphics just fine, slightly decreased, but the game has a glitch that makes it run way to fast.  I think what's wrong is the TurboBoost makes the CPU speed variable so it's messing with the modification tool which normally fixes that speed issue.  If you want to play that game, you're out of luck.  You will not be able to get a decent frame rate with Saints Row The Third; it runs too slow.For other games, it's running quite well.  For example, I've played Shank on it the other day and while it put out a lot of heat, the game played perfectly.  I've read online it's graphics are roughly equivalent to a Nvidia 220 card.  As long as the game doesn't require much more than 2 Ghz processor, as a rule of thumb you're probably OK with games that weren't high end graphics maybe three years ago or lighter new ones, but of course check system requirements.  It's not a gaming rig, but you should be able to play a number of older games.Upgrading to a core i5 processor is essentially a speed and a graphics card boost in one, making this laptop an even better deal.  Time will tell if the speed is balanced out by too much heat that kills the machine or some sort of hidden shortcut they took on build quality, but nobody can really say that for sure until the machine has been out a couple years.  If you're worried about it, you can buy a warranty from Dell.  Usually, the sooner you buy it the cheaper it is.", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3IGJKR3BUPHPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": null, "Date": null}, {"Title": "An i5 laptop, and for the price of an Atom based one!", "Author": "Charles Marslett \"Old man Texas\"", "ReviewID": "R37HLP8Y2MERIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Maybe an Atom or ARM based netbook or tablet would be lighter, and it might be cheaper (or it might not), but this does everything you need if you're not deep into gaming.

All we wanted was an address from them to send it to get it fixed.  They have refused.  My sister had the same problem with her Dell.  Dell use to be a decent vendor...them and their products have gone downhill.  Amazon wasn't much support either since it wasn't returned within 30 days.

Now im not that old, but I know quality when I see it. actually right now im writing this review on this laptop. computer is vvery fast and snappy thanks to the 15 processor, the black matte textured finish feels very nice but does attract faint finger marks. when you first get the laptop there will be two stickers, one that says some stats about the processor and sound quality, another one is the little intel 15 processor sticker. the bigger sticker, when taken off even with the most delicate care, will leave sticky residue on the laptop, which I currently haven't been able to get off yet. another problem I faced when getting the laptop was the laptop would make little beeps and boops like when I turn it on or something, like the systems sounds would work, but the problem was youtube videos and other non-system sounds and songs would not play. visual would play, but no sound would come out, which brought me great sadness while trying to watch the etrade baby comercials on youtube. BUT, I was able to fix the problem by going to the dell support app and test both sound cards. If you are having this problem which according to google is not a very uncommon problem, then go to your dell support app and mess around until you get the testing screen up, and just test both of the sound cards, one might say it failed, and the other one will say passes and let you click on two speakers and some sound will come out, then just go to music or youtube and it should work, otherwise invoke your warranty and send it back. overall this is a very nice laptop to get whatever you need done, whether your a minecraft gamer or an xbox gamer. this laptop is perfect for you. No problems with the keyoard or touch pad so far except for some minor windows 8 swipe issues when scrolling. the number pad on the side is very very handy when crunching numbers. the only reason I give this review 4 stars is because it took me 6 hours to fix my internal speakers for this blasted thing.

This laptop -after being purchased- was brought to Southamerica (where I live) but unfortunately arrived broken (it did not turn on), so at first I was very dissapointed with my purchase, thinking that it was my first Dell and it did not work at all...Well, then my only and last hope was Dell's Customer/Technical Help...I contacted them through Dell's website using their online help service and after giving them some details of my laptop, they came to the conclussion that the machine probably got broken because of a problem with the charger...So the question inside me was: Would Dell provide me with the technical help I was desesperately in need, eventhough my laptop was now in Southamerica? Their response was: Yes, Dell will send me the neccesary parts and the technician directly to my door eventhought at that moment I was in Southamerica. Dell's online assistants asked me some details of my address and gave me a deadline of 15 days, so I had to wait and see...To be honest I was a little skeptical thinking how Dell would manage to send me the help i needed...then, guess what?...After 12 days of waiting, a Dell technician came to my door, bringing all the parts to fix my laptop in front of me...He changed the parts that were neccesary to change, tested if the laptop worked  (the machine worked wonderfully after being serviced) gave me a new charger and Voil\u00e0! I had my much awaited laptop working. Now, the laptop works smoothly, performs really well and fits really well my needs. I am happy with its features. I know probably many read the reviews for techinical details but I have written mine mainly about how Dell answered to my technical request...it is because Dell's customer service blowed me away really, Dell solved my big problem eventhought I was thousand miles away from the place I originally bought this laptop.

This one has the best value for your money. The i5 is very fast and is great for web surfing, word processing, video games, and other tasks. The main reason I bought this laptop was for games. It plays most games well. Minecraft, Skyrim, and countless steam games are definitely playable. The fan is not too loud. The keyboard is just ok. I have used worse and I have used better. The touchpad is very nice. There is also a number pad which I don't use much, but I'm sure some people use it all the time. It has plenty of ports.

There is also an SD card slot. On the right side there is 1 USB 2.0, and a disc drive. I like Windows 8 a lot. A lot of people hate it, but they are probably just not used to it or don't like how different it is. I heard the start menu will be added in an update soon. The screen is decent and better than most in this price range. Overall I would recommend this laptop to anyone who does not have $1000 dollars to spend. The only problem I have had, is the space bar.

Had to borrow a laptop from the library in order to do presentation.
