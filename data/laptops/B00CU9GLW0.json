{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very powerful laptop.", "Author": "Soothing River", "ReviewID": "R1RXN5Z9N9NEGX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my GT60-2OD for about a week now. And it's been awesome. The keyboard is a pleasure to type on, the backlight and effects are very nice as well, and also as I read somewhere they did add a matte screen bezel for this generation so no distracting reflections while using your new laptop!I have it set on a coolermaster pad made for 17\" laptops, given that the screen bezel is pretty wide. Also, the laptop fits nicely inside the pad when transporting it or for storage. The cooling pad is mostly for elevation, but it does help ease the airflow around the system. Without it the temps are a little higher due to the fan intake/exhaust vents recycling some of the hot air that bounces of the wooden table which is very insulating and gets quite hot. Perhaps glass or metal tables are easier on the temps. I haven't been using the cooling pad fans, as I don't really think they would make much of a difference as the laptop is ventilated by the sides and not bottom, but I'm sure they could improve the temps by a few degrees.I did have some modifications done to the laptop. The thermal paste replaced with IC Diamond 24 by Gentech PC and I also had 3 mSSDs installed and set to RAID 0 to get a bigger SSD C: Drive. Also, as a bonus I got my RAM upgraded to 24 gigs.With the turbo fan on (from the touch bar controls) and ambient temps around 24 C neither the CPU nor the GPU ever go much above 80 C with heavy gaming for hours at ultra settings on the ARMA 3 Alpha which runs at around 45 FPS with default ULTRA settings.  A little reduction on draw distances and reduction of MSAA to 4x instead of 8x brought it up to 50 FPS. This with no overclocking or any kind of fiddling or any other settings changed. I'm sure that both the CPU and GPU are capable of a little more, but I haven't been there yet. The only that I did was to use the new feature MSI put in place, which uses some of the battery power to complement the supply when the 180W from the AC adapter aren't enough. It's called hybrid power and to use it you just need to open the program and press OK.But if you keep your factory thermal paste job, you might get higher temps than I did and maybe slightly slower FPS because of the system protecting itself from overheating. Some users on forums reported that some of the paste jobs were sloppy and that MSI used too much pasted and that some systems were overheating. So you may want to look into that, specially if you think your system is running too hot.Switching between GPU's is quite easy, to force Windows to use the Intel integrated GPU isntead of the 780m all the time you have to go to Nvidia Control panel/3d Settings/ and change your global settings to the integrated GPU and then restart the PC. This way your GPU light will remain white. Then, manually choose games and other programs that you want using the Nvidia GPU from that same menu. Light code: White=Intel HD4600 Orange=NVIDIA 780mI haven't done thorough battery tests, but as with any laptop I'm sure it greatly depends on the use. Maybe a little over an hour of gaming and perhaps 10 hours with devices turned off, minimum brightness and just light browsing and some video watching using the integrated GPU only. These numbers are invented and not any real representation. I will try to get some accurate numbers after I do some testing.There are some annoying quirks. Whenever I plug my G700 mouse (haven't tried any other mice) the computer auto disables the touchpad. And I have to go FN+F3 to enable again. The touchpad is really nice when typing and you need to do something with the cursor quickly, not so much if it's disabled. Apparently some of the Synaptics software does this and is somewhat complicated to fix as there is no toggle setting available natively. Maybe new drivers will have that feature, but with the ones you get out of the box your touchpad will be automatically disabled when another mouse input is connected. After searching on some forums someone pointed out to me this fix \"Disable internal pointing device when external USB pointing device is attached\" option in the synaptics control panel, open regedit and go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Synaptics\\SynTPEnh, right click and select New > DWORD (32-bit) Value and name it \"DisableIntPDFeature\". \"Modify it's value to 33 in hexadecimal, or 51 in decimal to enable it to be default on.\" I haven't tried it yet myself. But I might try to do it soon.I was unlucky enough to get a noisy fan when it is idling, it sound like toy car gears or perhaps a bad bearing. But a quick e-mail to my reseller and a few arrangements with MSI got me a new one coming in the mail. Which I will change myself. Since my warranty sticker had already been broken it's not an issue. Yet, you should contact MSI and ask about implications of breaking your warranty sticker. The consensus is that as long as you don't actually damage anything there shouldn't be a problem, yet I recommend contacting MSI yourself. You need to break it to upgrade your RAM with the 2 slots that are available upon opening the laptop (the other 2 are under the keyboard)I have been thinking about doing two things to improve the aesthetics of the notebook. And that is1)Removing the stickers, or at least just the Specs and MSI gaming series and maybe even the Sound Blaster one. The Intel and Nvidia one are fine. Since the handrest is made of aluminum, I would think that any glue residue would be easily removed with alcohol, lighter fluid or some other light solvent. This may decrease the resale value of the laptop later on, so it's a very personal call.2)Coming from the MSI GX60, I always hated the shiny screen bezel, yet I loved the chrome MSI logo. In the GT60 I love the matte bezel but the painted MSI logo on the bezel looks very cheap and detracts from the High-end look of the notebook. I ordered a pair or metal stickers from China that I found on eaby. They will get here in about 20 days, so we'll see about that. I know that I might have to modify things a little bit. The foremost reason I think MSI chose to do this is since the bezel is matte, the stickers wouldn't play so nice with that surface. Let's see what happens. I got a 2 pack, so I have a little slack there.As a footnote, I have been looking for good cases to keep and carry the laptop around. I haven't yet found a neoprene skin that would fit the laptop, it is bigger than a standard 15.6 incher and also thicker, but not as big as a 17 incher. I haven't yet found one but I'll keep looking. As for the case, after a lot of research I found a nice case that I think looks amazing, has a good price and offers good protection. The Condor 3-Way laptop case available here on Amazon seems to fit this laptop nicely. It seems to have a large enough pocket for the Power supply brick and has good padding and restraint all the way around. I'll post an update once I get it to see how well it fits.To wrap it up, I read on the owners forum for this laptop over at notebookreview that to get the warranty from MSI you have to complete the online form and then print and mail something back to them (through snail mail) to get the full warranty. I haven't done it yet and I suggest you look up some information. I will try to keep this review updated with any new developments.", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty solid, but room for improvement", "Author": "Chris H", "ReviewID": "R8V2GA7PRW4WM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Received mine earlier today and have been install, browsing and gaming for six hours.Initial impression:Unboxing the laptop, the overall weight of the unit and power adapter is fairly substantial.  This makes a good desktop replacement, but I could not see myself carrying this daily.  Overall, the construction is fairly good, but there are some short comings.  The hotkeys near the top creak and are not sturdy towards the center, the laptop screen has a decent amount of flex and the same for the bottom half.  The unit just does not feel as solid as the HP Elitebooks that I've owned in the past for example.I also am not a fan of the trackpad buttons.  They take a considerable amount of force to click and really force you to use the outer edges.  For some reason, the buttons are a single piece which adds to the frustration.  The keyboard is decent and the variable color back lighting is a nice touch.Turning the laptop on, it greats you with the typical Windows 8 setup.  There is not a lot of pre-installed applications, though I did end up removing a handful.  Fortunately, the Norton software was straight forward to remove along with the other software.  From there, it was easy to get online and start installing my common applications like Chrome, Steam, Avast and so on.Gaming:Since this is a laptop built around the fastest single mobile graphics card (780m) that was my next stop.  The first game I fired up was Skyrim along with the HD texture pack and a few other visual upgrades.  Due to Optimus, the installers recommends very low settings, but I set them to Ultra to start.  The majority of indoor zones and towns play without a hitch at Ultra.  However, out in the open world there was a considerable amount of stuttering at various times.  It will take some more tweaking to find the optimal settings as well as trying other games like Crysis 3 and so on.Summary:While I've only had a short time with the laptop, I'm happy with the value.  This makes a good portable gaming pc gaming system, but I will keep my ultrabook for mobile computing.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like a new model car, very nice and full of issues.", "Author": "Briggs", "ReviewID": "R185SE0GHMDAC4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sadly I bought this from a popular website starting with an N and ending in G which I will never use again. I purchased there only because Amazon themselves don't have this in stock yet. BIG MISTAKE as getting an RMA has been a nightmare.The laptop has great hardware for gaming, great sound, a good screen, fantastic keyboard. Scored 7700 on 3Dmark 11 P out of the box.Mine has a bad issue with the fan, it sounds like a locust is stuck inside my comp. The thing rattles at idle and whines at load, like a bad bearing or similar to coil whine. The disc drive also only works sometimes. My ssd drive changes its free space available after every restart despite setting a fixed mem allocation. It will go from anywhere between 68gb and 76gb. HEAT is bad, the CPU idles at about 65C and load up to 100C unless I turn on turbo fan. The GPU goes up to 91C at load.If I could get a refund I would but I'm stuck as they won't give one to me without paying 15% restocking. It was like pulling teeth to get a return label and my replacement isn't even guaranteed. If you buy this get it here.

It loads Windows almost instantaneously, runs games with the best resolution possible while still maintaining good fps and has more disk space than I can handle. What else could I ever want in a computer?", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Performance above all.", "Author": "Lukasz", "ReviewID": "R30U2XGIC33S3R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is made for people that don't want ultrabook-style thin body. For the price it offers exceptional performance, and the battery life is very decent (about 4.5 h on SSD only).Part-by-part review:- the screen is bright, and fullHD is sufficient for today's standards. There are higher-resolution models of it if you prefer that.- hard drive combination offers best of the two worlds. I double boot with Ubuntu on the HDD and while it's not as fast as Windows, it is still not bad. But if you want very good performance I recommend buying a second SSD for the alternative system. Also keep in mind the system setup is UEFI, which needs the latest Linux releases, and Nvidia Optimus might not be so easy to set up at first.- the keyboard is very comfortable, although there are some peculiar design quirks like the \"\\\" key between the Space and right Alt. On the other hand, removing the left Windows key is a great idea for gamers. The multi-color backlight is very useful and cool.- microphone & camera are decent. The internal mic is usually better than your generic external microphone.- CPU and GPU are a great tandem. But on battery you should watch if any applications use the dedicated nVidia GPU, because when it's on the power jumps from about 11W to 33W. While playing demanding games it's good to monitor the temps. MSI lets you up the fan speed to 100% with one keypress, but it gets pretty loud, so use it if you really do not mind the noise. While using less demanding applications like browsers of movie players the laptop is generally cool and noiseless.- speakers are pretty loud and generally do not produce artifacts. The sound drivers seem a bit complicated- software: the laptop comes with significant amount of bloat. While some might come in handy, you will not use most of it. Also the process of updating the system to Windows 8.1 is a bit involved, requires some research and re-installing some apps. I recommend doing it as quick as possible after buying the laptop.- touchpad is responsive and comes in handy in Win8. The keys are a bit hard to push but you can always tap.- BD-ROM drive closes tightly and works well.- externals & weight. This is not a light device. The MSI logo is lit up when the laptop is on. The space below the keyboard and back of the screen are made of black aluminum and the rest is sturdy plastic. Overall it feels very solid. The power supply is MASSIVE.- for people who buy a new one: you will not be able to get into the internals, ever the RAM, without voiding the warranty.All in all, coming from a 2011 mid-range laptop I can feel a big improvement. At this time and for this price you cannot get anything better (especially when buying it refurbished). But if you don't need very high performance I would recommend something cheaper.", "Date": "April 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for gaming", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "RYVGDUNYRPXG9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You could not ask for a better gaming laptop.

I almost took it back and got a Mac Book Pro but I wanted to see how the computer performed. I am glad I kept it. I have worked around the OS, kept it at 8.0 instead of 8.1, though I would prefer Win 7. The computer is a great performer. It is quiet and does not overheat under stress (gaming). It got a bit warm once (with Crysis played maxed out) but I just turned up the fan for a minute or so (to test how well it cooled) and the machine immediately cooled (again, it was not blistering hot, I just wanted to see if the extra cooling worked). The audio is pretty good and it plays DVD/BluRay discs well.EDIT 4-13-14--YES I would recommend this to a friend.What's great about it: super specs; wow, just look at em, esp for the price.What's not so great: it's a bit heavy, but the problem? WINDOWS 8 IS DRIVING ME CRAZY I HATE IT SO MUCHI am a long time computer (and OS) user. This machine deserves a 5 star rating. Just look at the specs and price, and you can see that it is a great deal. I really love the machine.That being said, I HATE windows 8 so much I don't even like turning on the machine. They need to give an option to have windows 7, or something. I would pay to get this garbage off my machine. I have used DOS, the different Mac OS (including the original 128 mac), and Windows since the first version. Win 8 is the FIRST OS I have ever had so much trouble with that it makes me hate the computer it is on. I am going to try putting Win7 on this laptop, though I am worried about losing some of the MSI special drivers/software. If that doesn't work, I may return the laptop JUST BECAUSE OF WIN 8!About me...

I travel a lot on business, and I like to kill my evenings in the hotel room doing online gaming.  For a variety of reasons, I can't/won't install my games on my business laptop, so I have to tote 2 computers.  For this reason I didn't want a 17+ inch behemoth, which virtually all gaming computers are these days.I compared this laptop extensively against the offerings by a number of other companies, and this one had the principal features that I wanted:(1) 15\" form factor.  As mentioned above, I didn't want a 17\" monster, but 14\" is a little cramped for gaming on.  15\" is what I determined to be the ideal size for my purposes.  I might have gone with a 14\" (or even a 17\") machine if it had all the other features that I wanted, but that turned out to be a non-issue anyway, since almost none of them did.(2) an SSD boot disk and a large mechanical storage disk (instead of a \"hybrid\" mechanical disk with SSD cache like that \"other\" brand).(3) a beastly, top of the line video card(4) an excellent processor(5) enough RAM for my purposes (I would have settled for 12, and I might have considered 8)As for the performance of this thing, I don't play the absolute latest hi-rez video games, but I can turn games from a couple years ago up to max rez and max eye candy, and it still gets silky smooth frame rates.  That *does* generate a lot of heat and you pretty much have to turn on the supplemental fan (user-controlled).  It's noisy at that point, but that's only necessary when you're really making it crank on the 3D graphics.  In desktop or video mode, it runs as cool as a cucumber and there's no need at all for the supplemental fan.  Its normal-use fan is essentially silent.  (Heck, maybe it's even the same fan, and the user-control button just kicks it into turbo mode - I haven't opened it up it up to see.)UPDATE:It turned out that it was getting so hot because I had it on one of those cheap card tables with a soft vinyl top: the laptop's feet were sinking into the soft tabletop, and blocking the underside air vent.  It does turn the fan speed up automatically, which works fine as long as you don't block the vent.  You can manually switch the fan into overdrive mode if you want, but as long as it has its normal amount of airspace underneath, I've never had to, even when playing 3D games.As a side note: my girlfriend described this machine as a \"sexy beast\".Anyway, this is a great laptop, I'm really pleased with the performance of it.

I upgraded from an Lenovo y580 to this, and honestly there is no comparison to anything on the market that can compete with this laptop. I am only speaking from my experience but the optimus unfortunately does not work with the 780m on this laptop. Playing games, it would randomly freeze for 2-4 secs and start back-up again which is so frustrating!! So I uninstalled, updated and re installed the drivers on the GPU-still did not work. Ran mem test, ran perfectly. Tried to lower settings on different games - still would not work!!! Then I did some research and I found that 780m gpus that use hybrid powered laptops(Which this laptop does) may have an issue with optimus. So I disable optimus while playing games and games run smoothly with no issues. Other then that, laptop works brilliantly!

Mine was very silent.The GTX780M is finally a mobile gpu that is able to handle all the games at 1080p without any performance issue. Compared to desktop gpu's is comparable to a gtx660ti, although the spec is equivalent to the GTX680 (with much lower clocks) and probably if you overclock it to the gtx680 clocks it will get same performance.No cpu/gpu throttling which is good, so you have all the full power of the hardware available for use.The sound quality for a laptop speaker, is very good, also, something in the specificaction fo this product (here and in msi website) does not say is this laptop has a headset amplifier, it is able to manage headsets like Sennheiser PC350 which has 150Ohms impendance very well.This laptop is heavy, so you have to be aware of that, and know almost every gaming laptop in this level will be heavy. Portability it will be somewhat an issue.Anyways, i am very satisfied with this laptop.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Gamming PC", "Author": "Felipe Lopes Conrado", "ReviewID": "RGOVARRHGR2IU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great gamming PC, good keyboard and amazing LCD, also great relations performance / cost, recomended. i think could have de \"dragon edition\" print in all GD series. but its ok", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice performer!", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R9OVW4OATW6FK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop, runs a bit warm but remains quiet without turbo fan (cooler booster 2) in very demanding games, but tap that button and everything cools off very well at the expense of fan noise.

But, folks have to have all info before buying this computer.I got this computer and out of the box it was pretty impressive.  My fans were not loud as I've seen reported numerous other places.  But, within an hour of getting things set up...I discovered my speakers didn't work.  Speakers.  How on God's green earth does a computer get shipped without testing the speakers? I mean...it's like not testing the keyboard.  It's just that basic and obvious.Anyway, I spoke to the vendor that shipped the comp to me and they agreed that the speakers were indeed broken as opposed to there being a driver problem or whatnot.  So, I got an RMA-refund.  This was especially annoying in that I had already gotten a dud from MSI that was already on en route back to MSI.Getting the RMA hasn't been an issue with MSI, so I'm not criticizing their customer service so much as their quality control and general quality of their products.I'm hoping this is an aberration, but with 2 broken machines returned...I suspect there's a bigger problem with MSI.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CU9GLW0"}}
