Absolutely no issues, computer worked great.  I ran some image-intensive programs on it for a while (Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop 32bit), and it handled them fine.  My main issue long term is I ran out of disk space as there is only about 150GB of disk space.  Gets used up when you start filling up your computer with a ton of large image files.  If you aren't doing stuff like that you'll be fine.  Or you could just buy an external hard drive to store your large files on.Anyway, I don't get all of the negative reviews.  Was not my experience at all.  Both of the computer batteries still work great.  It's not a top of the line laptop anymore, but it gets the job done and appears to be a long-lasting piece of equipment.Edit: January 2013-I gave this to my brother so he could have good personal computer and it's working great for him. He mainly uses it for internet, movies, etc., nothing too crazy.", "Date": "May 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Do not buy this product.", "Author": "Alper Lokcu", "ReviewID": "R3CB0LGV3NEDSE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "In all honesty, I was really excited when I bought this laptop a few years ago, and it worked really well for me (and this is why I'm giving it two stars instead of one), for about two years. I did notice excessive heating and fan noise when I ran games or movies on it, and I had to use a cooling pad at all times.Then one day, with no warning, the graphics card failed. My computer was left with a common 8 bit VGA graphics adapter. I looked for the fix, did the \"blowtorch the graphics card\" thing, and it did work. For about a week. Now whenever I try to install NVIDIA drivers for the graphics card, the computer hangs on the windows logo at startup, and I have to go back and restore to pre-NVIDIA driver update.i found out that there is absolutely nothing I can do about this. My warranty is expired and as far as I know HP refuses to deal with this problem. I think there's a lawsuit going on, but I'm just fed up with not being able to do anything that demands graphics performance on my computer.", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Problems with the graphic chipset", "Author": "LaPalida", "ReviewID": "R2R3LSUAWCWCHU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Although my review is for HP dv9500 which is just slightly different these models have the exact same problem.First my battery completely died after just 9 months but not to worry the warranty covered it. However the new battery is about to go, barely a year old, as well and I use the laptop almost exclusively as a desktop :S Then just May this year HP added this laptop to the battery recall program. Link to the HP battery recall form: [...] Apparently the batteries were deemed unsafe by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.Second, a while back there was a huge recall on HP and Dell laptops that used this nVidia chipset. Apparently nVidia used some sort of crappy material in their 86x series GPUs which made them burn out due to high temperatures. You can read all about it here: [...] During that time this laptop (dv9500) was not under the recall and after just 2 months over the 1year standard warranty that my laptop came with my video chip died. HP offered various ridiculous solutions for users on their message boards such as under-clocking the GPU and getting better ventilation for your laptop. I called several times to get this repaired for free but since my warranty was out I initially got refused the free repair. HP denied that the chip was affected which was clearly not true. After demanding to speak to the CEO of HP I finally got through to a case manager of some sorts who got me an extended warranty ($[...] around) which would be cover the repair as if it was under the warranty in the first place (which is another story - I tried to get an extended warranty while going overseas and was refused because apparently they don't cover repair overseas but only give phone support - which later turned out to be not true since I got covered although I had to pay the shipping). Unfortunately I live overseas and had to pay around $[...] extra to get it shipped there and back, but that is way less than what would cost for a new motherboard and installation. Of course I got the exact same brand of GPU chip back so there is no telling when it will die again.", "Date": "August 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy", "Author": "Sylvester Carolan", "ReviewID": "R3BJAI4GROCD55", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "HP have really messed up with this one - I will never buy another HP computer.", "Date": "October 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "My go to pc when nothing else works.", "Author": "William Oterson", "ReviewID": "REPNB2NWY1OL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't particularly happy with Windows Vista, which this HP Pavillion DV9500t laptop came with, however, aside from that issue I've not had an iota of trouble with it.The 'C' drive is only a bit more than 100gb's, however, I've a 1TB external HD attached to it and I've used this laptop with Adobe Photoshop & Lightroom loaded on it, again experiencing no problems.
