Just to make sure you know how hesitant I was, I tried Surface Pro 2 and Sony Vaio Duo 13 and Sony Flip 14 before this. The Surface 2 was defective as it kept going in to protection mode. Also, for such an expensive unit the build quality was not great on mine as the bezel was not level across, the middle sagged. I tried a second Pro 2 but the battery life was not great. I could only manage 4-4.5 hours. I then tried the Sony but both units suffered from horrible WiFi issues and the Flip 14 had \"stuff\" rolling around inside straight out of box. I also found the stylus on both Sony's kind of fought against the screen, it wasn't smooth. So, on a whim and with little thought I bought the Acer when it was on sale last week. It arrived yesterday and it's been flawless so far. There had been some reviews for last years model for WiFi issues but this unit has had no issues, and I don't have the best signal at home. As a matter of fact there's a Ipad sitting next to this computer with no connections as I type. The screen is good, BIG, but it is good. The pen stylus is also very good. Keyboard is brightly backlit and the volume is kick a@s!", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Computer with Perfect Keyboard Configuration", "Author": "Arts Lover", "ReviewID": "R3464LB6J4COZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently needed a new laptop, and I was very concerned about getting a Windows 8 machine.  With the upgrade to Windows 8.1, you can have an onscreen desktop that is very similar to the Windows 7 desktop, or you can use the Windows 8 start page.  I switch back and forth, finding that some things are easier on one than the other.Here is what sold me on this Acer machine.  As I was looking at various laptops at our local Best Buy, I noticed that the track pad has gotten bigger, while the keyboard is farther away from the front of the laptop.  I didn't like that at all.  That puts a person's hands in a very awkward position for typing.  I use an external mouse, and my guess is that a lot of people do.  That means that I have very little use for the track pad at all, so why would I want it to take up so much room at the front of my laptop?  Now that I have this computer with a touch screen, I have even less need for the track pad.  I've had this Acer R7-572-6423 for about two weeks now, and I love the position and feel of the keyboard.I also love the Ezel screen.  I can alter the position and angle of the screen from vertical to almost horizontal.  I can flip it over to show someone across from me what is on my screen, and the screen flips almost instantly for that person's viewing.  I can pull it forward so that it completely conceals the track pad or leave it back farther.  This Ezel seems to be very well-made and sturdy.Everything that we have installed on it that was on my old machine is running fine, too, so compatibility is great.  If you are apprehensive about Windows 8 but know a few people with Windows 8 machines, they can help you adjust to the differences and point you to where you can find things.  If you don't know anyone with Windows 8, you can always do searches for your questions and come up with answers.  It weighs about 5-1/2 lb, about a pound lighter than my Sony Viao.  It found my printer without my doing anything to install it.  My old mouse works great with it, and it's blazing fast and super quiet.  We can't even hear the fan.If I encounter any problems or issues, I'll be sure to update this review.  As it stands, I would highly recommend this computer.", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good design if you need a laptop, tablet and n-Trig digital pen", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"bitbank\"", "ReviewID": "RBMLSPV0N2L9I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:1) Excellent, bright high res (1080p) display with fast touch response and n-Trig pen digitizer input.2) Good battery life - the Core i5 Haswell allows 5 hours of real use.3) Useful screen flip design allows it to be used as a laptop or tablet4) Enough ports to handle everything you need to do.5) The bottom plate is easy to remove - easy access to memory, battery, HDD, PCIe LAN and mSata slot.6) 2 DIMM slots allow you to upgrade it to 16GB RAM if you want.Cons:1) Includes slow 1TB HDD - I immediately replaced it was a fast Samsung SSD. It boots Windows 8 in about 5 seconds.2) Keyboard / trackpad placement are a bit awkward when it's sitting on your lap. On a table it's fine.3) No optical drive. It's understandable due to the slim design, but now I need to use an external one.4) No Core i7 quad option - I would like to use this for software development, but a dual core i5 just isn't fast enough.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Finally a hybrid that meets my needs", "Author": "Roger W.", "ReviewID": "R229NWG142LY9X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a laptop that would allow me to use a digitizer and that also has a screen larger than 13 or 14 inches that is also a touchscreen and can do business tasks. I was even looking at the Wacom centiq line of products so i can do some design/drawing on it. I searched for a long time, roughly a year off and on, looking for this device and I took a chance on ordering this unique design.I know the tech geeks, of which I am a member and proudly so, have not really enjoyed this form factor because it steps out of the box of traditional laptops and offers up something truely exceptional. Being able to move the screen to where you want it turned out to be the single most innovative thing I have seen on any laptop over the years. Most of them let you flip the screen around or something along those lines, but nothing like this!I think you really can only appreciate it once you experience it as I tried this unit out at a local best buy (it is a best buy exlcusive so it isn't sold anywhere else yet). I bought a refurb unit and it looks and works like new, it does not come with some of the items a retail one does such as a cleaning cloth and a wrist pad although you can purchase those for a few extra bucks.The i5 processor is pretty quick on this unit with the old 5400 RPM drive even still. I did upgrade the ram to 16GB and also bought an mSATA drive so I could have a better experience using an SSD plus cut down on power consumption. I left the 1TB drive in for storage purposes and now this laptop loads extremely fast. All programs are very quick even photoshop loads in 3 seconds and boot times are roughly 5-6 seconds.You will have to order the Acer stylus or another N-trig stylus to make use of the pen support and I can say it tracks very well and does not have any issues with the new duo sense 2 pen I bought from Acer's website (the only place you can get it right now).There are so many things to love about this system and I have only had it for a week and I know it is going to be great to use for my new business needs. Go check out this product at your local best buy to really appreciate it before purchasing and then grab a refurb for $300 less than retail, you won't be dissapointed!", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far (1 week) I'm loving this laptop!", "Author": "Jeff Thorpe", "ReviewID": "R1UVP4HP4YJGAV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm still getting used to Windows 8.1 (I'm liking it, don't know what all the fuss is about), but this is a great laptop!  I've been waffling over a replacement for my laptop for a year now - I've been considering a tablet, or ultrabook, or Chromebook, or Surface tablet, but none of them truly fit my needs.  I decided to take a risk on this one, and I have no regrets.  The unit starts right up, the speakers are awesome and loud!, the screen has a great display and I love the touchscreen, and using the Ezel function works great.  I go back and forth using the touchscreen, and a wireless mouse all the time.  After a week, I still haven't used the trackpad so the location of it isn't an issue for me.  I bought a refurb laptop which looks and functions as new.  So far my only caveat is that if you are using it on a desk you will want a palm rest to get your hands at the right height - with the keyboard at the very edge of the laptop, there's no built in palmrest.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great design", "Author": "Ryan D", "ReviewID": "R39KZYMWV16OWU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have poor vision and I've tried in vain to comfortably use laptops. Even the 15 inch Retina MacBook Pro was one I reluctantly sold. But this is great since you can bring the screen closer. And the touch screen is actually pretty awesome too. Let's face it: traditional laptops are horribly designed and un-ergonomic. The only thing that would make this perfect would be if you could raise the height of the screen as well as move it forward. I can't believe CNET trashed this thing. Live a little and be open minded. Change is good and I hope this isn't a one-off since laptops definitely need an extreme makeover.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Acer R7", "Author": "Carolyn S Barber", "ReviewID": "R3PDVXX5B4P5D0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my R7 and have been using it for a while.  It was refurbished but looks and feels new.  I love it.  Great touch screen. You can use it as a tablet or a laptop. Lighted keyboard is very nice.  I also like the fact that the touchpad is located above the keys. When it's below the keys like it is on normal PC's I find I accidentally trigger it while typing and my cursor runs amok.", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVE <3", "Author": "Anna Madison", "ReviewID": "R33VQGVOHLNUBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love, love, love!!!!! Literally anything anyone could want in a laptop, tablet, easel, tv, anything! You name it, this laptop does it!

No probs. Arrived as expected item as described. Good price. Excellent condition as a refurbished item. Only a very tiny mark on hinge.

Most of the time you'll find me using it in the \"Ezel mode\" with the screen brought closer to the keyboard.  It's so nice to be able to have the screen closer to you for touch and reading.  The display by the way is amazingly clear and vivid.In my opinion, this represents the future of laptops!", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IFS3HMC"}}
