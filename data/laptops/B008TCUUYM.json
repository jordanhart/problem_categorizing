This laptop does the job. My only complaint is that it heats up extremely hot to the point that it feels dangerous to touch at and near the fan when this laptop is in operation over 8 hours straight. I sometimes leave the laptop on overnight; and the DM1 doesn't tolerate such continuous operation. As a result, my hard disk has broken, and I am in the market for a replacement. Look around, shop around. You may find a new laptop for $200 for Taiwanese brands.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Read Product Description", "Author": "B.
