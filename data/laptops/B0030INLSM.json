It worked perfectly then, but after coming to college the laptop has stopped working. The first time it was in sleep mode and when I came back to turn it on it wouldnt turn on. I pressed the power button, I did the thing with removing the battery and holding the power button for 30 seconds and still nothing. 8 hours later I try to turn it on and it does. A couple days later it has done the same thing except this time its not turning on. I am not sure if its a problem with the hardrive or if its only applicable to my computer but this should not be happening. Also, the speakers do suck if you are going to listen to music or anything, there is absolutely no base and the volume is very low. It also gathers a lot of dust and smudges all over. But otherwise everything is awesome, if it only it would turn on!", "Date": "September 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lowsy sound", "Author": "B&D; \"parents of Adam\"", "ReviewID": "R259I9KWN9XLSM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Awful speakers, tiny sound, no depth - can't hear it with any other noise in the background - not even with the AC running!!!!! If you need a laptop for anything that involves listening to sounds (playing music, DVDs, audiobooks, using Skype...), forget about it. And the customer service is crap. Simply return it before it's too late.", "Date": "June 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Too Big!", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R1MJN4TFTMM8TS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At 115.6 inches diagonal the screen is 7.5 feet wide by 6 feet high.  It's just not convenient to use as a laptop at this size.  Instead of being able to use it on the plane, they made me check it and pay an oversize baggage fee.  On a positive note, it's great for my friend who is visually impaired.  The built in keyboard is a monstrosity, but he hooked up a wireless keyboard and mouse and he can really see this screen.  If you order this, be forewarned that you'll need some help getting it into the house when it arrives.Cheers,", "Date": "February 5, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy this instead of a television!", "Author": "Chuck U.

In addition to watching movies on this, I will be able to surf the internet. I ordered it as quickly as I could before they sell out. I can't wait until it arrives! Hope the delivery person helps me get it into the house. What a great deal!", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0030INLSM"}}
