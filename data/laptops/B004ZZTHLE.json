I could not recommend. If you install the OS and don't see a wireless card in device manager, you don't just ship it, yo uFIX IT and THEN ship.

His review reflected HIS choice to purchase a $7 laptop from ebay.  YOU CAN'T EXPECT MUCH WITH THAT!!  THE FACT THAT EVERYTHING WORKED EXCEPT FOR THE WIRELESS CARD IS AWESOME.  He could buy a usb wireless card for $30 and be in business.This laptop is zippy, and has easy options for anyone who wants a decent laptop for a great price.  Either comes with a Dual Core or Intel core 2 Duo processor, between 1 - 4 GB of MEMORY, an 80 or 160GB sata 7200 rpm hard drive, Blue tooth, decent graphics card, etc.  The Core 2 Duo will run Windows 7 64 bit without issue!There is a good reason why these things are still around! They just keep running and were built right.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Core Duo 2.16GHz, 2GB DDR2 SDRAM 80GB DDR2\nGraphics-INTEL 945GM\nTFT 1920 x 1200 NATIVE RESOLUTION\nINTEL Wi-fi, WIN XPP-SP3 CoA\nDVD/CD-RW, GOOD BATTERY POWER", "Name": "Dell Latitude D820 Dual Core 15.4\" Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Gtfeaml1L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004ZZTHLE"}}
