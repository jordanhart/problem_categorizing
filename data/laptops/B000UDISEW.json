{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love my Lenovo", "Author": "Daniel Haworth \"Flechmen Foxwood\"", "ReviewID": "R2FR1IU5OM0SCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me tell you a story. A great many years ago, I had an IBM T30. That thing was a tank. It got dropped, battered, and abused. At one point it even flew out of a bicycle toddler trailer and into the middle of a road with very minimal damage. After the life that thing lived in my care, I sold it to a friend, who abused it for 5 more years before the motherboard gave up.After that machine, I was sold on Thinkpads, and I saved up to custom build a T61. I ordered mine direct from Lenovo and had it customized... 4GBs of RAM, nVidia graphics, Windows XP.. Later on, I put a 500GB hard drive in it and Windows 7.Lenovo carried on IBM's legacy with the Thinkpads. The quality on this unit is fantastic.The casing is solid and reliable, all of the components are incredibly reliable. I've never had an issue with my T61.This thing has been taken all over, dropped, stepped on, and battered. And it's taken all of this abuse with just one little piece of plastic breaking off. The lid hinges are solid stainless steel, the top is solid magnesium, the bottom is thick rugged plastic. This is one well built laptop.The nVidia NVS Quadro graphics used to be able to play most games with ease. The most modern of games tax it pretty heavily though. Considering it's a business laptop and not really a gaming one, this is pretty good.All features work well on it, including the kinda gimmicy keyboard light, which actually is quite helpful in the dark. Parts are readilly availble for it as well, so it's an easy machine to fix.Lenovo's support is second to none. After reinstalling Windows on this machine, the only thing you need to download is the Lenovo update utility and it will take care of the rest. Never seen another manufacture do that!The only things I've really had issue with is the power supply, which failed on me after a couple of years, and the sound card, which, like most modern systems, is this little Realtek thing that sounds terrible.But, those are my only real complaints. This poor laptop has been through a lot, and it's been a tough little beast.I would recommend this product.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "6 y/o ThinkPad T61 still gives other laptops a whipping", "Author": "LarryLMedina", "ReviewID": "R1CPC9Y0AU3TP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did not buy this laptop through Amazon but I wanted to share my thoughts here. I'm a poor counselor, living from paycheck to paycheck in highest-in-the-nation-cost-of-living state of Hawaii, and in college working toward my MSW. I needed a robust laptop to put up with college/work/personal life so I bought this T61 from a refurbisher for $130. It came with Win7, 80GB HDD, 2GB RAM and integrated graphics. Key tops were half-worn on the Home row and the LCD is wobbly from worn hinges. When closed, there is still a bit of play with the lid not latching down tightly. 6 years of existence and the laptop does creak a little on sides. I'm not complaining as this is a used T61 and I didn't expect roses.I upgraded the HDD and RAM and installed Windows 8. The T61 boots/runs faster with all the upgrades. The non-glare LCD is easy on the eyes, although dimmer than other non-glare LCD's I've seen (this is likely not due to age, since I read similar comments written back in 2007 when the T61 was first released). The touchpad is the smallest I've ever come across on any laptop and took me a while to get accustomed to. The T61's Trackpoint is a relic from the 1990s and I feel is outdated as a mouse control device and useless like a human appendix or a vestigal tail is. Lenovo still insisted to include it (and still does to this day) apparently to keep Trackpoint fans happy. The keyboard is louder/noiser and less firm than other keyboards I've used on other business/professional-grade laptops; however perfectly usable and comfortable to type on happily for hours without fatigue. Speakers aren't loud; a bit tinny to my ears but clear. The LCD lid's rubber coating mars easily but is easily cleaned up with a wiping of Windex. Contrary to another review written here, the lid itself is not solid magnesium: instead, it is a composite plastic (not carbon fiber) over a magnesium frame. Its construction still does the job in keeping it solid and near-flexible. The T61 is of the \"thin-and-light\" category when \"thin-and-light\" was defined at around 4-5lbs (the weight of this T61 is 5.2lbs with the stock batt). I got a new 7800mah batt off Amazon.com ($25) which bumps the weight up past 6lbs. Thin, yes. Light? No.Incidentally, batt life is 9+ hours with this new 7800mah batt under Win8 and in Power Saver mode, wifi off, and LCD dimmed to 50%.My T61 is good, solid-feeling (and solid-looking) laptop. Everything just works. The T61's early-1990's conservative looks, severely angular lines and all-black color make it look either 20+ years old or modern and contemporary, depending on who's eyeing it (I just think it looks \"classic\"). Other resellers sell T61's with better specs for up to $400 (and likely in better condition than mine) but I'm happy with the one I got and the price I paid for it. //", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid system, but hinges SUCK!", "Author": "TRJ", "ReviewID": "R3ILL6T7NS3OQ1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great reliability, tough, fast, workhorse, but on my third set of NEW hinges (they last about 3-6 months max before they start to become wobbly - bad design, every one of these I've played with has the same crappy hinge problem).I like being able to swap out the memory, hard drive, keyboard easily by yourself.

Rugged, affordable, reliable, these older laptops have delivered good performance and are always a solid financial choice, hundreds of dollars below similar, newer products. I purchased mine through Amazon marketplace with XP installed. I like XP and I don't need anything else for now. I installed 2 memory sticks of 2GB RAM each. The laptop, predictably, went to 3.2GB Ram, not 4. That is the maximum you'll get. I also had the HD replaced at Microcenter, but made the mistake of believing the salesman and instead of a full SSD, I let them put a hybrid HD. My laptop is faster than it would have been with its regular HD, but not even close to as fast as it would have been with a Solid State Drive. Besides, Microcenter charged me a pretty penny for the hybrid HD and for the installation. Corollary: install an SSD, period.Still, the laptop is great. I bought it used from Tampa Laptops (great seller, by the way). I tweaked what I judged was necessary and I've had a smooth-running laptop ever since. My previous Lenovo I gave to my youngest son, who is not into being really careful with his possessions, and the laptop has faithfully worked as well as when I had it.My eldest son has a newer Lenovo and that one is excellent, too.

It inadvertently goes into sleep mode at the most inoportune times due to overheating.  I read some of the posts on the web and they suggest cleaning the air intake.

This thing was born over a half a decade ago!Well, I bought mine because I wanted a separate dev box outside of my 2011 Macbook Pro. I love my MBP, but I already have it setup with Bootcamp (Windows 7), I didn't want to load another OS on it (space is starting to get tight), plus I wanted something that would function as a sort of mini-server for my own personal projects. Finally, I wanted something I could lug around without worrying about breaking it, so I bought this thing.I really couldn't be happier! I decided to replace the existing HDD with a 50 gig SSD that I found at Micro Center (Denver)  for $39 on clearance. I also replaced the battery with an Anker battery which I bought here on Amazon for $40. I loaded her up with Ubuntu and this thing zips right along! ~$180 might seem a little pricey for a 6 year old laptop, but considering this total includes SSD and a brand new battery, I'm quite pleased. SSD is more energy efficient and Ubuntu is fairly lightweight (compared to Windows), so I get a little over 4 hours of battery life which is certainly acceptable for this machine.The display is surprisingly nice and has very little glare, so it's easier on my eyes when compared to the MBP. The trackpad is nice, but not as nice as the MBP trackpad (but what is?). I like all the clicking options - I can touch the trackpad or use the buttons above or below the trackpad. The red tracking button on the keyboard is great and was quite easy to get used to.This thing is a joy to hack around on! SSD is a must, so I recommend throwing a small SSD in it if you can. The 50 gig drive I have now is small, but it's perfect for my needs as I really only use this as a dev box (I use my MBP for things like games, media, etc). Unfortunately, as another reviewer pointed out, the hinges do suck a bit.It's heavy and ugly, but that's how I like it.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Durable and reliable laptop", "Author": "Joshua Escamilla", "ReviewID": "R3LHRQ7LS5AXOT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wish I had known how good ThinkPads were a long time ago, so I wouldn't have bothered buying any other laptop. The trackpad and keyboard are very responsive and pleasing to the touch. While on the heavier side, this laptop is very thick and durable. The battery life is not so great--from two and a half to three hours on mine. The screen brightness is lower than on other laptops I've used, but bright enough without hurting the eyes. The hardware is perfectly supported on every Linux distro I've tried.

Shouldn't be a factor if all you're using it for is MS office/web-browsing/emails. Other then graphics use, surfing web, multitasking MS office apps, and general day to day online activities are as buttery as any other modern day laptop.Battery: (using extended battery 6600mah)Typical 3 hours of real life use (outlook open in background, Pidgin chat, and music playing in BG) at 60% screen brightness, can be stretched to 4.5 if I was just web-browsing (no others windows/apps). I had the regular 4400mah battery at first, but it barely ran for 1.5 hours, 2 if I was stingy with it. The bigger 6600mah battery adds bulk, but travelers will appreciate the extra work-time.Design: (will grow on you as time goes on)At first glance I thought, real ugly piece of machinery. Then my work place forced me to use one and boy, it has really grown on me. The keyboard is probably the best I've ever used, EVER. That's coming from owning a couple of Toshibas, Gateways, Sonys, Apples (powerbook & new MBPs), Asus, and HP laptops before. The keyboard alone makes me want to keep this thing forever. Kudos to Lenovo for developing such a great input product. On the downside, the screen isn't very bright, so if you want to work outside one day or are near some one with a newer model laptop (which means newer kind of display technology), the screen will appear very dark.Recommended for: Those on a budget, traveling business typesSeriously, the price you pay (amazon for around $200-300 last time I checked) can't be beat. Those who are on a budget that just want a laptop for browsing the web, chatting online, and streaming movies- this one is a winners' choice.

If you poke about Amazon you will find I wrote a review of the T42 which was fairly popular, I suggested it was (AND MAYBE STILL IS) the best deal on the used computer market (for everything but HD graphics) and suggested how to update the unit for modern use. I have currently 4 T42s in a network, and they are more fun than a barrel of hammers. However, realizing that time was moving inexorably on, I could not resist picking up a T61 at what appeared to be a bargain price. The specs are to die for, right? The unit had merely \"normal\" use for its age (not a spring chicken) and the hard drive was checked with a sector by sector utility, so I figured I was in good shape. Wrong. First disappointment was the screen. What were they thinking? Sounds good on paper, especially next to the T42 but in real life the T42 display was a superb example of old tech whereas the T61 is a poor example of new tech. Strike one. The hinges truly suck as the other reviewers say. They suck on an order of magnitude that is staggering and this in spite of the fact they are oversized. Raises serious issue about Lenovo's competency. Strike two. The fan needed to be replaced (did it ever) but to some extent this was my error, I forgot, when testing, to warm the machine up first. Replaced it myself, medium complexity, especially the routing of the wires. Additional research shows the fans do not last as long as earlier models. So we are already at 3 strikes. The internal mic did not work unless (trial and error) I inserted a male plug into the mic jack (any plug, did not matter) and removed it. Annoying. Spent hours trying to solve this frustrating issue AND THEN IN LATE 2012 A FULL 6 YEARS AFTER THE MODEL WAS INTRODUCED THEY RELEASED A FIX. The new driver solved the issue but 6 years? What are they smoking at Lenovo? As this is written, the T61 is still having battery issues (system reports all systems OK but the battery dies in 18 minutes) but is otherwise OK.

It wasn't around the time of the 60-series versions that I began to realize how this was no longer true.Pro- Brand name, serious-business looksEquals- Has a great feeling keyboard- although by this time it has been matched and even exceeded by other business-notebook brands (i.e. hp 6910p)Cons- still overpriced relative to competitorsDeep Flaws-1. CRAP HINGES: See those little gray squares on the bottom of the screen? They're supposed to be hinges but after opening and closing the lid hundreds of times two things can happen: (1) they slowly weaken until breaking when you increase the angle of the opening too wide [in my z61m] OR (2) they stiffen to the chassis and get semi-stuck. If you absentmindedly push it open- again a break and a screen that doesn't stand up by itself [in this model, my t61]2. OVERHEATING: in this model, my t61, a overheating problem became prevalent- the computer logs off and goes on standby at irregular times because its gotten too hot! This is common according to a google search that reveals people desperately posting on forums for a solution. TPFanControl, a free software made by a third-party amateur helps the problem inadvertently by making the fan run more liberally. But its a haphazard solution where a problem shouldn't exist in the first place.Conclusion:I'm amazed people still buy into the thinkpad brand thinking its something special. Relative to competitors they were at the top of the game in the late 90s and early 2000s, but nowadays they are not some super high-quality brand leader. When will people realize this? Or maybe they just like that high-class no-frills big-business look.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Do not buy from this vendor", "Author": "Michael Castricano", "ReviewID": "R1SWYQZJ9ENOML", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Laptop arrived in poorly padded USPS cardboard box.
