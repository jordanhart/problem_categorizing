It's small enough, but quite bulky for a 13\" laptop. The description on the Amazon page said it was less than 5\", but that's really not the case. It's battery life was also quite short--just a little over 3 hours using eco-mode. It isn't that light either. I have a 16\" Toshiba and the difference between the two in terms of weight seemed so minimal. Also, the back part of the laptop, where the battery is inserted is very noticeably bigger ('fatter') than the front. I was looking for a really lightweight one that I could bring around with me. The good thing about this Toshiba model of course is that it's got an optical (DVD) drive, the others from ACER and HP at this size don't. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to get an ACER 13\" as I need a lightweight machine that's got 4-5 hours at least of juice. Toshiba's are generally of good quality, but this 13\" one was just not for me. (I also wish Toshiba's would start making slim laptops again like the ones I had a couple years ago. Their new models tend to be on the 'fat' side. Decent price though--as I got the one (last week) for only $ 498. Sent it back to Amazon via UPS.", "Date": "March 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "elmar", "ReviewID": "R26GETGV1XCJFU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Speed is great, lots of storage space...smaller than my old dell, but not too small like my netbook.

Within the first few keystrokes this little bugger locks up. Terribly frustrating.  It may be due to the op sys (win 7) or the MS office software.  I don't know.  Either way the thing should not lock up when you're on the internet! That doesn't even require complicated computing power. It locked up while I was installing the software!  It locked up while I entered the wireless router info.  It locked up when I opened MS Word.  Ugh. I hate it.  My partner likes it and lives in hope that it will magically get better.
