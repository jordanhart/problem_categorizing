{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Worst Product on The Market", "Author": "Beyondtheseacoast", "ReviewID": "R21JZBXLK16DYL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have been a customer of Vaio for 20 years. A very happy customer. Up to now, whatever problem I had was fixed by customer services. This laptop however is the worst product I have ever seen, and unfortunately, owned.1) Window 8 is not working properly. If you have a computer running with window 7, believe me, you don't want to change.2) The mouse pad is a disaster. If you click one milimeter next to the area where you are supposed to, it won't work.4) The mouse pad also stops working regularly. Had to by an actual mouse. After calling customer services, downoaded some programme, still not working, this 2 months after purchase.5) When moving inside your apartment, the laptop doen't reconnect to the broadband. We have an apple in the apartment which always works, so this isn't an issue with the broadband. It is the laptop which can't reconnect everythime there is a spasm in the broadband. This has multiple, catastrophic effects in daily life, such as: emails aren't sent, orders not processed, skype conversations interrupted and so on.I will never buy Sony again. The customer services were so poor, I was shocked. If this is how a faithful customer is being treated, then my next laptop is an Apple.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0088YBOKK"}}
