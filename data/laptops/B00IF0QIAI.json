Most of all, it is brand new and runs windows 7,which is a must! The speed is pretty decent and the keyboard is fairly easy to type  on. So far I would recommend this item for people who want a compact laptop that is not touch screen and runs the wonderful win 7!", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "My new little friend", "Author": "TruthMaster", "ReviewID": "R1HAAWPYZMQ0BM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a beautiful black little laptop. The dual core processor and graphics card easily do the job unless you want a gaming machine.  Battery seems to last a long time. Netflix looks and plays great. Plus, Windows 7, yay! No complaints, great for the price.Edit: I'm still giving this 5 stars for now. I will say that my biggest complaint is the sound. Weak internal speakers. But it's not hard to plugin speakers, headphones, or bluetooth speakers, etc.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Kathy", "ReviewID": "RXPTUE36FA1AW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this as a gift for my Grandson.  A friend who is very knowledgeable with regard to computers recommended the Acer brand.  Even though it is smaller in size than the Toshiba it replaced, the Acer has more memory.  My Grandson wasn't concerned that this model did not have disk drive.  He is very pleased with the performance of the Acer.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "So Close", "Author": "AKN", "ReviewID": "R1TFPY0W85GG9C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using an Aspire One for a couple of years but it's showing signs of getting ready to die.  I was hoping to get a duplicate with Windows 7.  This is a lovely computer in so many ways except one, which I can't work with: I'm a touch typist, and the space bar doesn't work often when I hit it with my thumb as I'm typing.  I've read other reviews that mention this problem. If you are(whoops there it goes again) not atouch typist it might be ok for you but for me I can't use this to type on, and as a writer I do a lot of typing.The keys are also pretty stiff to me after my old one which had effortless keys, as far as how much pressure they needed when you type.  This one takes more pressure on the keys, and it's quite noticeable to me.  Maybe all newer computers take this much pressure to make the keys press, not sure.The computer is fairly fast, connects to Wi-Fi perfectly, and does everything right so I'm sadly going to have to keep looking for a computer that gives me the abilityto touch type.  As you can seehere, that space barnot working is a deal breaker for me.  Otherwise it's a beautifullittlecomputer.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect for our needs", "Author": "Puglover", "ReviewID": "R2WAQMD6OZOR81", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Arrived yesterday and is up and running exactly as it should.  It's much faster than our 4 year old Toshiba.  Love that it has Windows 7 so there's no learning curve for us.  Loaded some new programs like Open Office; downloads went smoothly.  Just wish it had Outlook but we added another free mail program that's working fine.  Overall we are very pleased.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is Awesome!", "Author": "Aurumir", "ReviewID": "R375N5UFX0FFYA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It does exactly what I want it to do, it runs Netflix, Hulu+, MLB.TV beautifully. Nice and compact, light and easy to carry around. All my peripherals are compatible and installed. It did take me a couple of hours to set it up to my needs but that was less time than I expected it to take. I totally anticipated spending a day or two getting everything installed and running the way I like.If you're looking for a small laptop that is light and very portable and streams video etc. this is the one to get. I'm not so sure it would be enough for serious online gamers. For the videos the quality is quite lovely and smooth. The speakers are pretty darn weak but that is to be expected but I already have a USB speaker lapdesk and wireless USB headphones and they provide good quality sound. If you're looking for sound quality be sure to get external speakers with this. (they are inexpensive and well worth the investment!)I love this laptop.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Linda D Nelson", "ReviewID": "R1WBBD0WZUM6X9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my laptop and it works well.

I always had a negative feeling about ACER but decided to try it out. It was terrible. However, Amazon replaced it within a 1.5 weeks but I did not want to hear about another ACER and just sent it back. I am waiting for the refund so I can buy a different brand in a shop not online. Nothing against online purchases but I would discourage you from buying this model. Maybe it is the AMD processor, whatever it is, no ACER for me, NEVER AGAIN. I had also downloaded office 365 student version in the laptop and still waiting to hear from Amazon how I can get back my micro soft office which I need for the new laptop I will get.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "DO NOY BUY AN ACER!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R22C6EY41447SU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It didn't work out of the box. The touch pad didn't work and tech support couldn't help me. I told them I wanted to send it back, as to who would want a computer that didn't work even upon set up? But they wouldn't help, saying they are Tech Support. I suggested they contact customer service. One would think they would be so contrite that they would send me a replacement overnight. But nope, they only offered to fix it. I don't think so! Why would I buy from a company that won't stand by their own product???? It is fortunate for me that I bought through Amazon so I can return it.
