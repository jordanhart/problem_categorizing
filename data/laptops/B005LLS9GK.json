The specs are decent if you only want it for just surfing the net or for a student.What I really like about it is that the in built webcam has a light when its activated so it great when using skype. What I hate about it is that touch pad is rough and the right and left keys are too close together (fingers go further away from where it really is)The price I see they are asking for it now (468.00) is definitely not worth it. If you want a basic computer this is for you.", "Date": "December 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love this laptop", "Author": "Gruntsmom", "ReviewID": "R2YY814OLJSLJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this laptop, I recieved it as a christmas gift. it was easy to activiate, it was easy to start up, the Norton Security was a good help to stop me from having any viruses on mine.
