I love it for watching movies.The keyboard is well spaced and just right. I feel the number pad is just an ugly waste that is for accountants and i am quite happy without it..The reason i bring up the keyboard is that many reviewers commented that the spacebar kept adding spaces but with my slow typing that has not been a problemThe next problem mentioned was the poor wifi. The wifi is adequate when close to router but fades away in the next room. So i bought a D link nano N300 usb wireless adapter.  I walked to my bedroom and tried both the internal and the USB seperately. A world of difference. 5 bars vs 1 bar. So i disable the inside adapter when i want more bandwith. So definitely get a USB adapter. Mine cost 28 bucks.The rest of the comments and working of the envy is given by the other reviewers so i wont bore you. But yes u can work around the wireless situation.I have also added a 64 GB micro sd card so that i have 128 gbs of memory. I use mini usb lexar 32gb and 64 gb flash drives also which are unobtrusive and can be a back up source for movies etc.The HDMI port was useful and i watched some netflix movies already on my TV.The reason i give it only 4 stars is because some foolish engineer stuck the headphone jack at the base of the tablet where it can only be reached by detatching the tablet from the keyboard. So no listening to music while typing etc. I understand they needed to put the jack on the base of the tablet because the other sides are too thin. But if you look at the right hand side of the tablet base there is lot of space to stick the jack in there where it wont be covered by the clasp and you can use a right angle jack to access the space..Bad HP . Fire your engineer.Windows 8 works great on the tablet.  The memory is more that adequate for general use. I have done all sorts of short cuts and tricks to make it work like Windows 7 and 8 combined, with all the usual  - my computer, control panel etc available at a touch. In windows 7 I only had the desktop. Now i have a fully functional desktop with start button and a very rich  and loaded start screen. I hated windows 8 initially but the more i work with it the more i realize how intuitive and functional it is. The new kid on the block is not going away so embrace it now and not have it force fed later..And basically it is just windows 7 dressed up in xmas wrapping. So enjoy it with a great tablet keyboard HP envy..........Xstasy.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Envy x2 is awesome", "Author": "John Hayworth", "ReviewID": "R3GLUJ589UP66S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really don't like apple products....This is way more than a tablet...it is closer to a macbook air crossed with an IPAD....except priced much lowerexcept it can actually do everything my full size laptop does...awesomeLove two batteries...can't recommend this item enough..only negative is the charge cable is special order...no after market cables yet...give it timeBattery life is long enough for a full workday anyway", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm Quite Pleased", "Author": "T. Fehring \"Farringwell\"", "ReviewID": "R3G7AF8CT622BY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased an HP Envy x2 mainly for travel purposes.  I have a desktop for home and business use, as well as an all-in-one for family and general entertainment purposes.  My old laptop weighted 6 pounds - perhaps 7 when the charger and other peripherials were included.  Replacing it with the Envy provides me with the functions I need when I travel.  While admittedly it is a compromise device - it is a compromise that I'm happy to take.  By this I  mean, the Envy is far lighter and smaller, but as a result it has a much smaller screen.  I don't find the processor speed and umph to be much of an issue.  I'm not into gaming, except for some casual thing;  - so I find the processor's capability quite adequate.I am on my second trip with the Envy.  My first was a 3 day business trip, which occurred shortly after I purchased it.  This second trip is a lengthy vacation trip involving international travel.  Now that I have gotten fairly comfortable with my Edge, and have it set up to my liking, I would like to provide a few observations.WHAT I LIKEBattery life (awesome)Weight and sizeTablet conversion - it's easy to move from tablet to laptop and back againTablet use and functionalityAppearance - it's gorgeousBoot time - almost instantaneousMemory card storage (SD and microSD)HDMI port; two USB portsCool running (my old laptop got uncomfortably warm to hold in my lap)WHAT I THINK I WILL EVENTUALLY LIKEWindows 8The keyboardWHAT COULD BE IMPROVEDA USB 3.0 port would have been nice.Sound volume - with headphones I have trouble hearing music and movies above airplane background noise.  (I'm hoping that a software `tweak' might eventually resolve this.)Windows Office - a limited version could have been included, as on the Windows 8-lite (or RMT or whatever they call it) devices.The laptop hingeLet me discuss a couple of issues in greater depth.KeyboardI am a touch typist - used to handle 70 wpm easily, but have slowed over the years - as has my accuracy.  On the Edge x2, I find the keyboard a bit smaller than I am used to, which also increases my error rate somewhat.  However, with that said, I find that I can easily type on the device.I disabled many of the touch pad functions - including the swipe from edge setting.  I think that may be the main culprit.  A touch typist generally has his/her thumbs poised over the space bar.  In the case of the Envy, that places the thumbs over the top of the touchpad area and, at least in my case, relatively close to the surface of the touch pad.  I have saved a separate `profile' in the touch pad device for routine typing, and another for other functions.  That way I can switch from one-to-another fairly easily.  I also changed a setting in the keyboard control panel - to increase the pause that holding down a key will cause a key to be repeated.I am typing this with my Envy and testing it as I type along.  I'm finding that I am reasonably accurate and am typing with minimal issues.  I do occasionally run into an error that may be attributed to the keyboard.  It appears occasionally when I type `the' and get `the e' instead.  I need to get additional experience with the touchpad settings to find which ones might cause a problem.  However, for now I am reasonably satisfied.The keyboard feel is pretty good.  I like the key travel and feel.  I suspect that I will get used to it over time, and my accuracy will improve.Wi-FiI find the Wi-Fi to be pretty good.  I have used it fairly extensively with multiple systems and haven't experienced any real issues.  I do find that the strength bars in some cases to be one lower than my cell phone, but haven't noticed a problem with speed, etc.Windows 8I like the direction that Microsoft it taking.  The new `start screen' overlay is easy to use - as are the various programs designed to run in this environment.  I especially like the Wall Street Journal app, and the Bing news app.  I'm a bit of a news junky.  Clearly, most programs need to be modified in order to work properly with  a touch screen.  The ones that have taken this leap show good promise.But, more software customized for Windows 8 needs to be available.  Over time I'm certain this will occur.The Edge on the ENVYWhen used in laptop mode, and on your lap, the hinge protrudes somewhat sharply into your knees.  I like the way it functions when used on a flat surface - riding up a bit in the back so that the keyboard slants.  However, when used on your lap it begins to get uncomfortable after awhile.  I place a soft sleeve, which I purchased to hold my Edge, between the device and my lap - which takes care of the problem.BOTTOM LINEI'm happy with my purchase.  And, at the current price, I think the Edge x2 is a relative bargain.ExtraneousThere doesn't appear to be a lot of peripherials available for the Envy x2.  While I found a nice soft sleeve that fits it perfectly, I had a difficult time finding a case for the tablet alone.  I wanted one for tablet-only use, to protect it from scratches.  I eventually discovered one made for another Windows 8 tablet.  It fits well, but the cutouts aren't in the right positions, although they are close.  I had to create a hole for the `on' switch.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice idea...not so great in practice", "Author": "V. Tudor \"MD\"", "ReviewID": "RI60TBQUVB234", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The laptop looks and feels nice - yet it lacks performance and stability.The hardware + the Windows 8 OS combination is not great. The screen is not always responsive to touch, the system crashes every 15-20min, while the mouse pad is very bad. If the system goes idle - forget about recovering your work - the only way it starts is through a forced shut down (quite annoying behavior).The laptop/tablet is good for travel as it is light and thin and fits in any bag ... yet if you have serious work to do while on travel, think twice .. you may be better off with a traditional, more powerful laptop.I am not sure if it is the HP hardware or the Windows 8 that makes this laptop so unstable in use ... I am giving my two cents on the overall performance of the system.", "Date": "October 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, when using as intended.", "Author": "CoffeeSnob", "ReviewID": "RXHN5KKR3P971", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have a normal company-supplied laptop with windows 7 that I use for Work-related stuff. My wife has her own laptop and an Ipad, which I use occasionally for pretty light duty stuff (general web-browsing and reading).  She got a job that requires she travel most of the time, and she takes her laptop and ipad with her. I miss having those two devices around so I can my have work computer logged onto the VPN while I do all my personal stuff on separate devices. I tried Win 8 on a non-touchscreen computer and didn't like it, but I couldn't justify the expenditure of buying a Macbook and an ipad for my relatively casual computing. I also considered a chromebook, but they don't run Skype, which is one of my primary uses for whatever device I would buy. I decided to bite the bullet and buy one of these dual-function Windows 8 devices, and settled on the envy x2 when I found it on sale at a brick and mortar store (sorry Amazon, they had a better price)After using my X2, I like Windows 8 much better now that I've been using it with a touchscreen.  It actually makes sense to me now; For use only as a computer with a mouse, I like OS X and Windows 7 better, and for use only on a Mobile device I like iOS and android better, but if one is going to use the same device as both a PC and a tablet, and therefore a single operating system for both, Windows 8 is the tool for the job.Although it doesn't have the power for serious gaming or the storage capacity of a regular laptop, it browses like a PC, feels solid like a laptop and is easy to type on. As a tablet, if you can get over the fact that it's a little bigger (only a little) than and Ipad, it really is a very functional Tablet once you're used to Windows 8. It seems really well built with the Aluminum cover, the substantial feeling keyboard and the awesome connection between the screen and the base while still being relatively small and light.*I feel the need to amend my review: With the screen detached, it appears to work fine and was actually a very nice tablet until I tried to use it while it was sitting on a plastic tray table on an airplane and the whole left side of the touch screen was unresponsive. I returned it and got a new one, which had the same problem... worked fine in my hand, but nothing on the left side worked if it was lying down on a non-conductive surface. Since I was 0 for 2, I did some research a found that this is a common problem and there were several demonstrations if it on youtube [...] I called HP, and they were actually very nice, but they admitted that it was a known problem and the engineers were working on it and they would give me a call back when they had a solution.I didn't want to wait, so I took it back to the store and got something else. The next day HP called back, I didn't bother to answer because I had already gotten something else that I was happy with. For all I know they may have had some kind of update that would fix it or they may have offered to replace it with a newer version.  I was actually generally impressed with HPs customer service.  I know my wife types with her thumbs while holding the tablet with her fingers.  Someone who types like she does might not ever have noticed, but I set it down and type with my fingers, so I didn't find it to be a tolerable flaw, even if it was a cool little machine.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic convertible laptop!", "Author": "JT", "ReviewID": "R136ZSQPIROESQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this laptop.

It's important to note that the X2 runs full Windows 8, meaning you can download any legacy applications, a.k.a. applications that run on the desktop.  You also have the option to purchase apps in the Windows Store, similar to Google Play.  This combined makes Windows 8 not to bad.  You have the option to use the metro interface or the old desktop just like in Windows 7 and prior editions, it's the perfect bled.  If you take 10 minutes to play around with Windows 8, it really is not that big of a learning curve, all you need is the basics and you will be up and running.  Now to the laptop or Convertible Hybrid as it's called.  The X2 is a beautifully designed product that is well put together.  But, there is one issue many consumers seem to be having, maintaining a strong Wifi connection.  In my firsthand experience the Wifi signal on this laptop sucks, anywhere more than 15 feet from a router and the connection drops to just one bar.  If I'm next to the router and i have four bars, the internet is still slower than my old HP laptop from 2009.  I sent the laptop back to HP for repair but the issue has yet to be fixed, making it almost unusable since the location I generally use this at is 20 or so feet from my router, leaving the internet very slow.  If you are considering this product i would recommend doing a simple google search of \"hp envy x2 wifi issues\" where a HP forum will pop up as one of the first listings, where hundreds of Envy X2 owners express their frustration with the computer WiFi performance.

Price is much better from Amazon.com than Amazon.ca, and few if any Canadian retailers stock it as of the end of July.Really compact light weight PC with removal screen that functions as a tablet device. This was really handy on numerous air flight legs this trip, and the oblong shape is perfect for reading and annotating Acrobat PDF files of journal articles, which is what I really wanted a table for anyway.Pluses: Battery life seems almost unlimited. If the lid is closed between uses, the battery remains useable for days.Sleek, lightweight, bright adjustable screen that worked in a variety of lighting environments on planes and airports, password protected. Keyboard has similar feel to an Apple Wireless, the impression that the space key misses an ordinary typing speeds may just be a matter of getting use to it.Drawbacks:Windows 8 seems to be attempt to make a PC look like an iPhone. Apps instead of programs. The basic interface is quite different, the learning curve steep, lots of cute apps I'll likely never use, and I haven't gained very much if anything for serious work.The 2Gb memory seems to produce notably slower response times; when these were first advertised a 4Gb version was mentioned, don't hear about that anymore. This may have been a function of internet speed while travelling.The nominal 64Gb drive is partitioned as a useable 47G C drive and an 11G D 'recovery' drive. This seems a foolish waste of space, as the x2 will easily accommodate an outboard disc drive should recovery be necessary.x2 easily accommodated an Office 365 installation and other web downloads.I was unaware that epub books would not open readily in Windows OS: the intermediate steps are kludgy, the PDF format is far less friendly than the ePub, and copyrighted texts convert less than half the time.

First off, well done Hp! the build quality on this unit is just outstanding. When the keyboard and tablet are assembled together, it feels so solid that you wouldn't think is a convertible. I didn't think I'd like the aluminum finish at first, but it grew on me fast since it is very elegant. The only negative I've found so far is the placement of the speakers. They're on the bottom of the tablet so when using as a laptop, the sound won't go as loud since the keyboard it's kinda covering it. I know  there are plenty of Microsoft and Windows 8 haters but I'm one who's heavily invested in their ecosystem, I even have a Windows Phone 8. After a few minutes of setting this device up, the syncing of all my apps, music, games and pictures through Microsoft's Skydrive cloud storage was incredibly fast and easy. By now you already know that yes, I highly recommend this product. UPDATE on 8/10/13, beware of thick screen protectors out there. I was starting to think there was something wrong with the touchscreen response. It turned out to be the screen protector I had on it. Took it off and couldn't be happier. Windows 8 is even better with the touchscreen capabilities. Btw, when using as a tablet this isn't a tablet you wanna be holding for long periods of time. Remember, it is almost 3 inches larger than an iPad. In fact, when watching a little bit of Netflix on the couch, I just keep it docked and that way I let the keyboard hold it for me.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "It is ok. not very fast but does most the jobs", "Author": "Ken", "ReviewID": "R3976WDDKHRT9B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is well built, feel very strong, the batteries life is good, I got 8 hours for one charge on continue play movies nonstop. so I guess if I just surf the net and do light offece work it will last over 10 hours.

We sent the tablet in to HP to have it looked at and all they did was return it with a fresh install of Windows, no repairs to any hardware despite having it for 8 days. (+ 4 days shipping) I am pretty sure the SSD is not right with this tablet, but HP insists it is ok.Now, two weeks later it still has the same problems where it cannot open any windows 8 apps, windows updates will not download, and sfc /scannow cannot fix the corruption because the recovery source is corrupted. This is the same situation it was in before I sent it in for repair. Erg.I really think there is something wrong with the SSD.  Who makes an SSD that only reads about 20MB/s?

Batteries in the base and tablet part combine for a lot of use without the charger--I mean as in days and days of occasional use. Windows 8 is a lot more fun with a touch-screen.

I'll take a \"slow\" processor over a loud, thick and battery killing machine like my current laptop", "Author": "Michael J. Gandara", "ReviewID": "R3581AC4V5OJLR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Asus VivoTab RT but my frustration with Windows RT finally convinced me to return it. It was a really nice tablet, but I definitely needed full Windows 8. I also have a HP Pavillion dv7 laptop and it is pretty much the exact opposite of these new Windows 8 tablets: it's heavy (6 lbs), it's loud, the battery life is terrible (from 100% to practically 0% in only 2 hours) but it has a core i7 processor. I was interested in the Envy x2 for quite sometime and bought it on eBay because Amazon did not sell it at the time. Finally got it and WOW I am totally impressed with everything!Screen: Just like the ASUS VivoTab RT TF600T-B1-GR 10.1-Inch 32 GB Tablet (Gray)it is an IPS display and the crispness is just terrific! Compared to my HP pavilion dv7 laptop, which I bought for $750, the Envy x2 just blows it out of the water, period. Vivid colors, sharp display, all around great. I have a little minor complaint though: the dummy micro SD card that is inside the tablet is extremely difficult to put back in without breaking your nails, so I have just left it out since I don't really need that anyways.Keyboard: I have not encountered the keyboard issue yet (though it has a fix via a BIOS update, check HP's website) since the keyboard is small enough that I usually don't type too fast. However, I am really glad I considered an 11.6 inch size, because the Asus VivoTab's keyboard was just CRAMPED! I had to curl my fingers and still had to look at the keyboard to know what I was doing! Not the case for the Envy x2, as I am typing this and have had no issues with it. If you are a typist, go with an 11.6 inch size because a 10 inch is just too cramped. HP really wants to emphasize using this as a laptop, as this is not sold separately which to me is a good thing. It does have all of the essential ports: 2 x USB 2.0, Full size HDMI, headphone jack, full size SD card slot. The tablet only has a microSD slot and a headphone jack for ports.Responsiveness: Here's what I usually do on this tablet: Read websites, stream HD videos (Crunchyroll), RemoteJoy (projecting my PSP's screen onto the tablet, since my PSP's screen is cracked big time) and using online educational tools such as MyMathLab. All of these work responsibly well with the Envy x2, and I have yet to encounter anything major such as a crash or BSoD. Everything from swiping back in Metro IE 10 to go back a page, to streaming full 1080p video and using Flash-heavy websites, the Envy x2 does without a problem. In fact, I wonder why I even bought a $750 Core i7 laptop, when this little guy for about $200 less does it just as well and doesn't run out of juice in less than 2 hours!Battery life: I have been using it for two hours now, on 40% brightness (the brightness levels are in intervals of 10%) with Bluetooth and NFC off and it's still 85% battery! By this time on my dv7 laptop, it would likely be around 20%!Minor issues:Using headphones connected to the dock, the sound is a lot less loud then if I were to plug them in directly to the tablet itself. Not a major issue, but something to note. Actually, now it starts to make a loud popping sound when I watch YouTube videos which actually hurts a little bit. Could be my headphones, but for now I will use the tablet's speakers for laptop mode.The Wi-Fi is at 2-3 bars, but strangely everything still loads quite fast. Apparently lots of people have issues with the Wi-Fi, but I am using one of my ISP's slowest internet plans, so I guess it doesn't really affect me.Overall, I am absolutely in love with the Envy. The tablet itself at least to me doesn't have any plastic, though I think the keyboard does but everything about the Envy x2 is so sleek and professional looking!

tablets where large portions of the screen are not responsive when you place the tablet on certain surfaces (demonstrated in video). I had this issue with my tablet and sent it for repair only to have it returned by HP with a note saying \"NO DEFECT FOUND\"[sic], despite the fact that the repair engineer called me and told me he was able to see the issue. I don't know if that is indicative of a screw up in the repair process or whether this is an issue that HP knows about and is choosing to ignore.  After complaining about the issue HP offered a replacement which they sent to me a week late after being told it would only take 3 days. The replacement has the exact same issue. A quick search on google for \"HP Envy X2 grounding issue\" will show a youtube video where you can see a demonstration and a thread on HP's support forum where a number of customers are experiencing the same issue.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great notepad/laptop in one. Win8 not great but promising.", "Author": "I Yoo", "ReviewID": "R1IA2KLIFWOX08", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a convertible laptop running Win8 because I wanted the convenience of a tablet and the versatility to run my Windows applications with a keyboard. I settled on HP Envy x2 and am pretty happy with the choice. I ruled out Surface Pro because it was too expensive (with the keyboard). Thinkpad twist was a serious contender but after checking out Dell XPS with a similar profile, I ruled it out because it was too bulky. When detached, Envy x2 weighs no more than my iPad and has larger display size, which nicely complements Win8's ability to run an app on the side bar. Like another reviewer here, I also read that the keyboard might be of concern but it seems to work just fine. One thing to note is that the storage is more in line with what you'd find in a high-end tablet. Although it starts at 64GB, 10GB is reserved and another 10GB is taken up by Win8. I think if you go to HP directly, you can get an upgrade to 128GB. One minor issue that I have encountered with the hardware is that when in tablet mode and laying flat, once in awhile the touch screen seems to become unresponsive. Tilting it slightly seems to cure the problem.That's the hardware story. Win8 is another matter and the new OS takes some time getting adjusted to. It took some time adjusting all the tile layouts to be somewhat efficient to navigate but once I did that I actually like it when using in tablet mode. Another thing that is a bit annoying and getting used to is that the keyboard (in tablet mode) doesn't automatically popup when running Windows applications. Still, I think Win8 is a step in the right direction for Microsoft to support the touch screen devices. Now if they would only bring back the start button...A couple of updates:Signed up for SkyDrive so now I have 7GB of additional cloud storage. Not that I needed it but it makes file sharing easier.I noticed that when the notepad is detached and running low on battery, attaching it to the keyboard charges the notepad from the battery in the keyboard. It seems like an obvious thing to do but still a nice feature.Installed Office 2013 (~2 GB) and it seems to run ok (better than expected) in notepad mode. There is a toggle in Office 2013 to optimize the control layout for the tablet.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Look and feel of quality", "Author": "Jeffery L Mueller", "ReviewID": "R1XE7S2A219TJG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not the most powerful PC I have, not by a long stretch.  however, I don't need it to be, I have a larger unit for that.

You should go to the HP driver page for this device and download this very important update.  Look for the file sp61143.  The bios version is f08.I'm impressed that HP actually went through and tracked down the root cause of this issue.  Now, all devices are fixed.***************Original Review************************I am writing this coming from the asus vivotab tf810c.  Before I go on, allow me to point out a few advantages the envy x2 has over the vivotab tf810c.(1) The envy knows when you have the docking station plugged in.  When you have the dock plugged in, when you want to type something the onscreen keyboard will not pop up.  When the docking station is not on, the onscreen keyboard will pop up.(2) The envy feels more comfortable in my hands when I'm holding the tablet portion only.  Slightly better design.(3) The envy has the same color throughout.  The vivotab and its dock are 2 different colors.(4) The envy's speakers are in  the front.  Yes, somehow hp managed to put  the speakers in the front.  The vivotab's speakers are e in the back.(5) When docked in notebook form, the envy feels like one piece.  Very very sturdy. The vivotab is kinda wobbly.(6) I got the envy for $557, including tax, brand new.  Got the vivotab used for $863.  Will be selling the vivotab soon.(7) The envy has a full size sdcard slot and a full size hdmi port.  The vivotab does  not.Other than these things, the 2 devices are pretty much the same in all other aspects.With that said, the envy x2 really is a nice piece of work by HP.  The entire machine in notebook form is very thin, very light, and very attractive looking.  With the exception of the glass face, all of this machine is made of brushed aluminum making it look very classy and very aesthetically pleasing.I am a field engineer that does surveying for a living.  The applications of this windows 8 machine is perfect for what  I do.  And I would wager that for most professionals out there regardless of what kind this tablet/laptop hybrid would serve their purpose just as well.Why do I say that despite this machine running on clover trail atom processor?  The answer is quite simple.  Think this to  yourself.  If you have to work using very resource  intensive programs like autocad, photoshop, or 3D modeling, would you want to sit there for hours working with an 11.6 inch screen?  I'm betting the answer is NO.  I wouldn't want to work on the data we collected in the fields with such a small screen.  That's what our i5 and i7 desktops with 22-24 inch screens are for.What this machine is designed to do is be your companion with your work time and off time.  The clover trail atom processor of the envy x2 has plenty power to run engineering calculation programs like hy-8 and excel.  And many of us in the professional world knows that often times we have to crank out a report of a quick survey and send them off to our clients.  This machine is more than capable of running full version of MS office 2010.  No lag at all.Another use I have for this machine is the camera.  Before when I needed to send documents to clients or colleagues, I have to go back to the office and use the scanner.  Nowadays, using mobile scanner app from the MS store, I could take pictures  of the document pages, quickly convert them into pdf files, and email them off using my phone's internet tether.Now, I don't doubt other  people's reports of spotty wifi connection.  But for me, the wifi has been nothing short of perfect.  Bluetooth works wonderfully well as well.Another advantage the envy gives is it's got a microsdcard slot and a full size sdcard slot.  I have a 64gb micro and a 64gb full sd card.  They add up to 128gb of expanded memory for me, which is plenty for what I want to use this machine for.  And when that's not enough, I also have a 128gb jump drive that  I can insert into either of the 2 usb ports.Overall, I'm pleased with this product by HP.  All softwares are running perfectly.  I have not noticed any lag from the envy x2.  The device feels incredibly solid.Even though I had nothing but good things to say about the vivotab, I hesitated to recommend it to some friends of mine simply because of the lack of an sdcard port and a few other quirks.But for the HP Envy X2, I would highly recommend it to people I know.  I have a very good friend who is a therapist.  It is time for her to get a new computer.  She called me up last night to ask what she should get, and I recommended her the envy x2.**************************************************************************First Edit (March 13, 2013) [Problem solved - read Second Edit below]********************************A commenter pointed out something that I hadn't noticed before.  There is a bug with the keyboard of  the envy x2.  If you type really fast, about 5% of the  time a duplicate letter would be inserted after a space.  So, if  I were to type really fast, the last sentence would look like the following.If you type e really fast, about 5% of the e time a duplicate letter r would be inserted after r a space.Most of the time, I type at a normal pace, about 30-40 WPM.  When I want to, I can type up to 70 WPM.  This is why I hadn't noticed this problem in the original review.  So, I've taken out a star and downgraded this review to 4 star instead of 5.It is still a very capable device.  Among professionals, the average typing speed is 38-40 WPM.  So, for most people this bug would not even show up.I will be calling HP to ask about this bug.  There's also some complaints already on the HP tech forum.  Hopefully, HP will come up with a fix eventually.**********************Second Edit (3/14/2013) Problem solved!**************************So, I just went out to Staples to replace my envy x2 because of the keyboard defect because I called yesterday and they told me they just got a new patch of stock in.  These are newer and were manufactured in 2013.  The other x2 was manufactured at the end of 2012.As soon as I got home with this new envy x2, I installed MS office and started typing like crazy.  In fact, I'm typing this review really really fast right now.  So far, no double spaces or double letters inserted.  They solved this issue in later models!Back to 5 stars!Further more, the new keyboard feels more satisfying to speed type.  Every stroke registers without a problem.  I am typing up to 70-80 WPM and everything registers with no double spaces or double letters.I can now fully recommend this product to everyone.**********************Update (6/27/2013) ***************************************The clover trail processor on this thing really is more powerful than most people think.  My i7 desktop died on me a few months ago and I've been procrastinating in getting another desktop.  I just accepted another job, and I won't start that job for a couple weeks.  So, I've been spending all my time updating my apps and writing new ones.Using visual studio express 2012, I started and finished an app and published it entirely with this machine.  I am in the process of writing another app right now using only the x2.  I just plug it into the 24 inch monitor at home and use it like a desktop.  Hopefully, I will be able to finish the  app to publish it by this weekend.The point is the people who are dissing the x2 saying the processor is not powerful enough, they don't really know what they are talking about.  I'm creating and publishing apps using only this device.  That should tell you how capable this machine really is.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lovely machine with poor  ... no make that very poor Wi-Fi", "Author": "Samuel J \"iNetSynch\"", "ReviewID": "R3KW50P5N6OM44", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Some back ground: over thirty years developing software and hardware, experience with Windows 8 on six computers including two Hp towers, Toshiba laptop and upgraded Acer W500 tablet. I tried the new Acer W510 and sent it back.The Envy X2 looks and feels lovely. The screen and keyboard are good. The fly in the ointment is an almost unusable Wi-Fi, keyboard docking errors and issues with the installed Windows 8 recovery option.After charging and updating, I closed the Envy went to another room and when I opened it I was greeted with a message to the effect the pad did not match the dock and wanted me to re-flash the dock (EC version of Pad and Dock do not match). Twice now I have had to re-flash the dock to use it with the tablet. It seems OK now but makes me very nervous.Wi-Fi is poor ... very poor and documented by others on the HP forum. In most locations, I get between 1/10 to 3/4 the download speed seen when using all other PCs. When next to my router I can get 80 - 90% the download speed reported by my Acer W500 Win 8 tablet. Web Pages load slower and it useless when in my bedroom. My Acer W500 and lowly Sumsung Chromebook have no issues with Wi-Fi in any room.I tried to Reset to factory install of Windows and got a message something close to `could not refresh sending error file to Microsoft.' I  was forced to re-install in safe mode using f11 during boot. This had no effect on Wi-Fi.Twice Windows updates have crashed with a blue screen of death. Poor Wi-Fi and the inability to reset to factory state without booting in safe mode are deal killers. Too bad ... the machine would be a keeper if the Wi-Fi were improved and issues with Windows recovery fixed.Check HP Envy forums or before buying.UPDATE:The HP Envy was returned. I believe the poor Wi-FI performance is traceable to design and may make it unacceptable to many customers.UPDATE 2:Notice that Amazon no longer sells the Envy 2. Perhaps the return rate is too high?

They still have not fixed the computer and are not willing to replace the unit or refund the cost, even though after having had the computer for 9 months now I have probably been able to use if for less than half of the time. Not to mention that every time they send it back to me  I have to reset all the settings of the computer. Obviously they sold me a faulty unit, but are unwilling to do something about it .I am not sure how many times I have to send this computer back to HP until they fix it.

I already have a laptop that I'm happy with. I ordered this over an iPad because I thought I would like Windows 8 better. I definitely wish I could take that decision back, as Windows 8 has been nothing but a big disappointment. But I'm reviewing the Envy, not Windows 8.When I first got this the keyboard was dead. Wouldn't work so I couldn't complete the initial setup required. It was useless. Amazon was quick to replace though. So the next one I received worked great. Although I still have issued with getting the touch pad mouse to work, it's fixed by restarting the computer. It's a quick but annoying fix that I've learned to deal with. I don't use the mouse that much anyways.After I got over that, it is a great tablet device. Too slow for some heavier programs you can run on a laptop but a great tablet.

The form factor is very cool, from the super sleek brushed aluminum case to the ability to detach the screen to use it as a standalone Windows tablet. As other reviews have noted, be sure to realize the Envy X2 purposefully isn't designed for CPU-intensive applications like Photoshop, 3D games, etc but the trade-off is the battery life is insanely long. It handles emails, Microsoft Office, web surfing, videos, music and everything else I need during the day or when travelling just fine and I have yet to run down the battery power all the way in a single day. It's not the best choice for your main/only laptop but if you're looking for something great to use more like a net book plus then you can't go wrong here.One thing about laptops that's always bothered me is that they're supposed to be designed for portability but with most laptops you're lucky to eek out 2 hours if you're using it a lot which is why you always see people with their laptops plugged in to wall outlets at Starbucks, airports, etc. It offends my sense of logic to what a device that's supposed to be wireless but still be a slave to a power cord. With my HP Envy X2 I always laugh now and feel sorry for people when I see them sit down with their laptop and immediately plug it in. The Envy X2 gives you true freedom from wires and you don't have to worry about running out of power...that ALONE is a reason to get this device.To summarize:Pros:1) Insanely great battery life2) See above3) Super cool form factor with detachable screen/tablet ability4) Touch screen capability which works with keyboard and tablet both (really nice for scrolling)Cons:1) Limited CPU power (again, which gives you longer battery life but be aware)2) Small hard drive: I would give this 5 stars if HP had included a slightly larger SSD hard drive. It's big enough to do the job but I would've preferred a 100/120 MB drive option and happily paid for it.3) Small RAM: I also wish HP had given this 4 GB of rather than 2 GB. Windows 8 eats up almost the full 2 gigs itself so 2 more gigs for apps would be great.Overall: truly amazing 2nd or \"on the road\" device.

A lightweight(ish) portable machine2. A tablet running a full version of windows with a laptop keyboard.3. A perfect computer for browsing the internet/watching youtube/online banking/other activities that 99.9% of people do on their computers.I've had this machine for a week and I'm liking it so far. It is perfect for what I need it for (web browsing and video watching). This machine runs media via XBMC with no problems after some adjustments(uncheck hardware acceleration in playback settings and plug in HDMI before starting it up and change sound setting to HDMI TV). I was able to hook up a portable hard drive and use that as the media feeder for XBMC and it had no trouble playing my media. It also runs Spotify just fine. If you need some more power download \"Teamviewer\" on your main computer and this computer and you can remote in from anywhere! Here are my pros and cons:Pros:- Included the keyboard dock- Two full sized USB ports- Full sized HDMI port- Full sized SD card reader.- Micro SD card slot on the tablet- Portable- Battery life (download \"battery care\" for accurate percentages/time left)Cons:- SOUND. This one is HUGE (and the main reason why I'm docking a star) The sound is horrible. Google \"Digital Power Station\" by Bongiovi Acoustics and download that program! It's free for 48 hours, but then it's $20. Totally worth the cost! I went from needing my sound to 80-100 (and still not be loud enough) to 25 being too loud!  I have mine set on \"built in\"/\"movie\" all the time (the headphones setting is lacking)- Somewhat heavy for a portable (I know I'm contradicting myself, but I wish it was a little big lighter.)- Tablet is a bit awkward to hold- With the tablet attached, it is top heavy and can tip backwards if the screen is back too far- No HDMI/USB on the tablet portion- Windows 8 is not that intuitive (download \"Start 8\" to get your start button back in desktop mode)- Not a lot of disk space (it's easy to go a bit download crazy since you can download anything, but you really have to treat it like a tablet in the disk space department).- SD cards are hard to get in/out of the slots without a tool of some sort.Overall, this computer is perfect for my needs and I'm sure many other people's. Think of it as a computer with a tablet form factor and battery life. I know the Intel Haswell chips are just on the horizon and they are promising i-core machines with 10+ hours of battery life. Unfortunately, we don't know how much those machines will cost or if they will have a lot of issues early on. I see myself getting a machine with those chips, but I'll probably wait a year or so until the price comes down/bugs are fixed. Until then, this machine is perfect for my daily needs. 4/5", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good laptop", "Author": "Hiromi Kumamaru", "ReviewID": "R31CK8TG0SIDC9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this small, light, and detachable laptop, which is very useful as the portable as well as tablet computer.", "Date": "June 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "works great", "Author": "Robert Guerra", "ReviewID": "R36MGETEOVAEVS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works grey, processor is great, Hard drive is great and tablet can be used with any and all programs just like any other laptop.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sweet", "Author": "Oscar", "ReviewID": "RB4XK4OVZYONJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A nice laptop/tablet at a great price.

I'm liking Windows 8.  It seems easy to pick up the new tricks and formats.  I've been using this primarily in the laptop mode (clicked together), but will migrate more to tablet mode when traveling.Pros:  Really nice bright screen, and 11.6 is a good size.  Snappy processor.  Ability to switch from traditional desktop mode to Windows \"tiles\" and \"charms\" easily.  Fairly reasonable price.  Very customizable. Great battery life. Good keyboard.  Good USB & SD ports. I easily installed Office (from an external DVD/CD drive), AOL desktop, Adobe Reader, Firefox, etc.  Printing: Was able to e-print to HP laser located down the hall on the first attempt. Yeah!Cons:  Small hard drive.  With the above loaded (and no pics or music), I have approximately 23 gigs free.  Adequate at best, but will make do.  A bit \"too slick\"... the chrome is pretty and all, but in tablet mode, there is nothing to \"grab\" and it feels slippery in your hands (say, compared to my Kindle Fire).  I do NOT care for the audio, it seems quite tinny, even compared to the Kindle Fire's audio (but I was able to easily bluetooth to an external speaker).

It is very glitchy. After dealing with several issues, I nearly sent it back, but foolishly thought that the upgrade to WIN 8.1 had solved the problems. Sometimes it did. Sometimes not. As mentioned in many reviews, the touchpad cuts out regularly, even after updating the driver.  Just ridiculous.I have too much time invested in this to start over with a new system.

Also, its not a 'tablet' this is a hybrid.  A Hybrid is not simply a tablet with a keyboard tossed onto it.  A Hybrid can be used as either a full PC with a full blown OS and your standard programs or you can pop off the top and have a thin, lite tablet that runs the tablet programs and still be able to use all your full power programs.  So you get the best of both worlds without paying for two devices!  The hinge seems to add a little weight to the device but its amazingly sturdy and props the computer up to a very comfortable position.  The dual batteries resulted it in staying in standby for day when I accidently left it on.  The touch screen is highly responsive.  It has FULL sized keys!  Typing is very easy and highly efficient which is critical to anyone who is into productivity.This PC runs Windows, Excel, PowerPoint etc..  It runs all of my productivity programs.

This thin, super portable PC with all its features cannot compare to my desktop but then no notebook runs as fast as my desktop.

When I close one document it is almost instantly updated on both computers.  Using the cloud I am completely productive on both of my systems.  Even if I had 10 computers to use if they all had that folder and my programs (Word, Excel..) I would be 100% productive.

Having spent around a week with the device, I can now say that it's almost perfect, and it far exceeds my expectations for a 1st generation device. I'll be brief about the biggest pros and the only cons.Major pros:-The battery life is phenomenal. I keep it plugged in overnight and I use it frequently throughout the day. I absolutely believe the advertised 12+ hours. I even have it set to sleep on battery power only after 60 minutes of inactivity, because it really just doesn't matter.-There are some cons involved with the Atom processor (see below), but it does a great job handling several large PDF's that I use frequently in my academic work. This Atom chip is a lot more capable than the ones on netbooks from 2-3 years ago.-Envy is a great name for the device. People are impressed when they notice it's a touchscreen, and their eyes bug out when you detach the tablet.Minor cons:-I had a previous unit that I returned after the keyboard problem, and unfortunately on my new one the dock connection seems somewhat less tight and secure--there's just a little wobble in the tablet relative to the dock, and I worry about long term stress on the electrical/data plug.-The Atom processor has exceeded my expectations in most respects, but it struggles with Word 2013 in large (200+ page) documents. This is odd to me, since it handles PDF's of the same size extremely well.=============ORIGINAL REVIEW:I absolutely wanted to love this device, but it suffers from a major keyboard defect.As indicated in at least one of the other reviews here, the device suffers from an incredibly frustrating problem with the keyboard. If you type with any kind of speed, then random characters are repeated, either extra spaces, or the letter that had been typed before a space. The pattern will look something like this:\"The  quick brown fox xjumps over the lazy ydog.\"I've found out that this is a widely encountered problem, with several threads about it on the HP support forums, but nothing in the way of a substantive response from HP. I don't know that it's a problem on 100% of the devices, but a couple of people who went through 2 or 3 of the devices reported encountering it on all of them. If you don't type particularly fast, you might never notice the problem. I bought the device mainly as a secondary word processing device, so the keyboard error was an absolute deal breaker.In my case, HP technical support wouldn't acknowledge that this was a known problem, and they wanted me to ship the device to a repair center, less than 4 hours after unboxing it. After reading that several people on the HP forums have gone through the repair process and still received back a device with a faulty keyboard, I decided to return the device to Amazon.", "Date": "February 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tablet very nice, Keyboard has one major flaw.

All of the control panel volume settings have been optimized. I think that H.P. should have a Recall just like the Auto companies when there is a design defect such as this. I did my research on this before buying and didn't see anything out there on this issue and so I feel compelled to be the \"whistle blower\". I hope that this review works it's way back to somebody in charge who can make the necessary changes to keep another American company's image from being tarnished.I've also noticed that the battery drains excessively when mated together as a Laptop(down approx.5%/day)when shut down and unplugged from AC and will be in the charge mode for quite some time when you resume using it and plugged back into AC again. My windows 7 HP Pavilion on the other hand can be shut down for weeks and is usually @ 100% when it is powered back up again. This condition doesn't seem to hold true  when the Tablet is separated  from the Keyboard however and seems to hold a charge as expected.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Enough", "Author": "Christian Okpada", "ReviewID": "R2DE6J22GC8AD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If I good get a casing for the tablet part of this system it would score my 5 star.

I want a mobile device, so battery life is a key. The i3/i5/i7 tablets are somewhat short in battery life except Acer's Iconia W700. Even for Iconia, the i3/i5 processor is an overkill since I am not going to play Crysis nor any other graphic intensive game on a 11 inch screen. Honestly, Microsoft Surface tablet has feature I ever wanted in a mobile device, but the battery life killed the deal. If Microsoft can get Surface Pro to about 6-7 hour battery life, I will buy it in a heartbeat. There is a lot of potential for future surface pro models.  ARM processor  offers great battery life and comparable performance over Intel Atom, but having a real version of windows 8 instead of RT means I have a lot more choices over software. If in the future RT becomes more widely adopted, I will definitely consider switching.Here is why I picked Envy x2:Having a keyboard that can be easily integrated with the tablet is very important to me since I don't need this to be in tablet all the time. Having a keyboard would means I don't need to carry a second laptop with me if I do decide to work in Word or type anything more than few sentences.Advantage of Envy x2 over Asus vivotab ME400 is this one got a nice keyboard. The origami folded style stand with a detached keyboard seems like very troublesome to type anything serious unless you always have a flat surface like a table, and definitely not idea if you ever type on your lap. As far as Acer W510 goes, the tablet looks wonderful and it was very light weight, but the clamshell keyboard makes it look like a kid's toy. Acer's W700 seems like an idea candidate, but then again lack a good attachable keyboard is a problem. I really had a difficult time choosing between the Samsung ATIV, Lenovo Tab 2, and this. I didn't choose Lenovo due to the price difference and again lack of a good keyboard dock. ATIV has a stylus which I would like to have, but the exterior plastic just doesn't fit my taste.Review of Envy x2:The body is made of aluminum, which looks absolutely gorgeous. It has a nice keyboard dock with additional battery which is also very surprising good for typing. There is no problem at all for working in Microsoft Word. Battery life is very good, with mixed combination of Microsoft Word, Surfing the Web, watching Netflix, I get about 12 hours with the keyboard dock.Microsoft windows 8 works great on this device. The interface is fluid and responsive. Hardly noticed any lag if at all despite this machine runs on Atom processor.However, this device is not very easy on the hand when holding for a long period of time with just one hand grabbing by the edge. It is better with holding by using both hand or grab the center. It would easier to hold if there is a good case for it. So far, I haven't see any case on sell for this device at all.Pro:Good battery lifeNice finishing aluminum finishingKeyboard dock and can convert into a laptop.Surprising good speed (I was initially worried about the atom processor)Real Windows 8Con:No active stylus (I am hearing rumors Envy x2 supposes to come with one, but after going over multiple forum and website, that seems not to be true)Keyboard dock fits somewhat looselyHonestly, even at 1.5 lb, this tablet is hard to hold in one hand due to it's length.This device is not good for you if:You primarily need a tablet and don't need to type much. Get a lighter weight 10 inch tablet instead. Your hands and fingers will thank you. I would personally recommend Lenovo's Tab 2 (light weight, easy to hold, also stylus)If you need an active stylus, get Samsung ATIV if you need to type or Lenovo tab 2 if you not into typing.If you are planning to use this as your only computer.Conclusion:Good laptop/tablet for people who needs mobility. Overall very stylish looking device with nice metal finishing. Good productivities value with nice keyboard.

Error reads \"use the last login used on this account\"? So 1) hours back I was in and out gmail accounts, shopping accounts and this machine is asking me to remember the LAST one I used?? or 2) find a connection so I CAN LOGIN.Major problem 2: I have NOTHING stored on this machine. Zero. I have 17.6 GB free out of 46.3. The only programs I have installed are firewall, antivirus, and Windows office (for work). So MAKE SURE before you leave home you are logged into your user account and be prepared to buy a few SDHC Flash Memory Cards for all your work, and don't depend on picking up the coffee shop wifi.Major problem 3: Agree sound card so cheap you cannot play music on this machine. Unless you love the sound of 1960 scratched mono vinyl records.*****Major problem 4: Still hauling the AC adapter!! HP, where can I buy a back up????? No I am NOT paying $$$80 for one. What a scam!!So no music, no video, no memory, no RAM, no app games, no wifi, NO ADAPTER, and to get Kindle to PC to work you need to be a good Tech (luckily I am and found an Opensource program to read my books). Good cam. Think what you need before you buy and know your tech level!Pro: Still is working after 4 months cycling to work.*************************************************************Envy: Love the keyboard. Compact but sensitive and comfortable.Amazing display.WARNING! The tablet weighs more than the keyboard! Do not place on the edge where a slight tap will topple it over. No, this did not happen to me. I tested this as soon as I placed it on the table. With 2 cats this was an important test.I'll update this after a few months use (Bought in March 2013 so check back this summer). My commute to work consists of 30m by bicycle most days (3m on rough roads), some Metro/trains. The cycle commute already killed one 16\" laptop (Toshiba). I'm hoping the Tablets are tougher.Windows 8:WARNING! You will NOT get 64G memory -- not even close! 11G is swallowed on Drive D for re-installation and another 20G is eaten by Win 8. That leaves you with about 24G!!WARNING! If you are not use to Cloud computing you need to take the time to learn! M$ created Win 8 to >seamlessly< move between the Cloud and your hard-drive. The Cloud is not 100% safe and if your document/media is on the Cloud you cannot reach it unless you are connected to the internet. Basically, if you use an App it is on the Cloud.No Hibernate, just Sleep.APPS do NOT uninstall! The link is just removed from sight. .5G is not an issue when you have terabytes of memory but in Tablets this is important.Kindle:I bought this so I would only have to carry 1 device for work and commute entertainment (ie Kindle). Here is what I learned.Kindle APP: Fail. After an hour I could only open one book at a time, I love my digital library the same as my bookshelves. I also like to read more than one book at a time. Also during my tests I would >think< I sent the book to my hard-drive but when turning off wifi (airport mode) found out the book was on some mysterious Cloud and not accessible. Not an experience I want on a bus! --- So I am using the Kindle to PC download. Which means you have to download all of your books, one at a time, and create your 'Collection' again. But at least I KNOW they are on my Tablet. >>> Update: good luck with Kindle to PC. Found an Open Source to read my books.  >>>>note about Kindle books: To authors/artist NO I do NOT agree that when I pay for digital content (books, music, photos...) I am only RENTING! That is so WRONG! Sadly Amazon is on the line of this. Ki$$ing up to the publishers and what consumers will support. So at anytime an author can decide to take off the books and swoop, those books are no longer in your library AND no refund because you were just 'renting' the digital materials.

Davis", "ReviewID": "RDHXXYNJKD45W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Envy X2 is not a high performance machine, but is a decent machine for checking email, social media, web browsing, and moderate processing. It is not ideal for multi-tasking with numerous applications open. I purchased it because I was not looking for a high performance machine, but I wanted a tablet with a keyboard option with a full OS that wasn't going to cost $1,000+. The Envy x2 has met those requirements, with a few quirks:1. Unintentional double-spacing. As others have reported, there is an issue with inserting extra spaces when typing. I only notice it when I am typing at higher speeds, but I tested it using MS Word and in a full paragraph it flagged several extra spaces between words. Not a deal breaker for me, but if you need that accuracy this machine will cause you headaches. However, I have not yet noticed the extra characters being inserted (maybe that was fixed with one of the updates).2. Camera quality. Although it includes an 8MP rear camera and a \"HD\" front facing webcam, the quality of the pictures it takes is awful. I never intended to use it for taking pictures, but the pictures I took using the rear camera were grainy and blurry. I tried adjusting the settings, but it didn't help. The front facing webcam was what you would expect from a low quality webcam, definitely not \"HD\". Edit: I am going to check with tech support on this because I found reviews that included pictures they took with both cameras and their images look pretty good... nothing like what I'm getting.3. Wi-fi connection. When I first logon, the wi-fi always seems to establish a \"limited\" connection. I have to disconnect and re-connect to resolve. After that, it works ok until I shut down and sign back in again.4. Speakers. The Beats audio dual speakers are a joke. If you want any decent sound out of it, you will need a bluetooth speaker or headphones.I purchased mine from Staples for $525+tax so at that price I can live with the above inconveniences.

They have a voice prompt for people experiencing 'power on' issues. That's what I would call a 'hint'.------------------------------------------I've had my Envy x2 for close to a year now but it is going in a box today and will be returned. For anyone doing research prior to buying an Envy x2, google `Envy x2 won't turn on' .... and then look for another brand of tablet. I have 2 other HP computers and really like HP products and I love the x2 when I am able to get it to turn on, but I am finally done dealing with this horrendous device.When I first bought this x2 I noticed there were times it would not power up on the first attempt. The problem got worse but it appeared to me that is was more a BIOS or resource conflict issue and after seeing other people were having the same issue, I had hoped HP would resolve this and offer a fix through an update. I did periodically conduct my own searches for BIOS or other updates, performed the updates, but the problem remained.About 2 weeks ago I had the x2 take more than 100 attempts to turn on and that was the last straw for me. I called HP and after being transferred 7 times, I finally got someone who walked me through a BIOS update and the device appeared to be working properly. For 1 week, it powered up every time on the first attempt. Then I noticed there were Windows updates scheduled to be installed, which I allowed to happen. Immediately after they installed, I made 130 attempts to turn the x2 on, to no avail. HP recommends you press and hold the power button for at least 4 seconds. The 130 attempts took close to 7 minutes, but it would not turn on.This morning I tried again and the device powered up on the 7th attempt. I am wiping the hard drive right now and it will be IN THE BOX once complete and going back to someone. I would prefer to get my money back but am not sure that will happen as I've had the device for close to 1 year.I love the x2 once I get it to power up but it is going back because I am not going to spend 6 or 7 minutes trying to turn something on. I've owned 20 to 25 computers in my life and this is the absolute worst computing device I have ever owned.There appears to be some x2 owners who do not experience this issue but it also appears HP cannot figure why this is happening to far too many users.
