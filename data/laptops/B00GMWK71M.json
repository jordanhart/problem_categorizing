{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Some minor flaws but nothing horrible", "Author": "freeflow246", "ReviewID": "RXC8Q24UHD20C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop to replace my old one when I dropped it a mere foot and half of the screen went permanently white, as if it were some unsteady old biddy tripping and shattering its brittle bones. I'm not that picky when it comes to computers; I just needed something that didn't run only on Cloud storage and had a CD drive. I know, so hard to please. I tried this puppy out at a local Office Depot, but they were out of stock and refused to sell me the display computer, which I would have been fine with. So I had to order it online and wait for it to ship. Wonderful.I've been using it for roughly 3-4 months now, so here's the skinny on all the basic features from the point of view of someone who is completely computer illiterate. I don't know anything about processors or cores or whatever. This will be mostly complaining since you don't want to know what's amazing about it, you want to know if it has anything you want to avoid in a laptop.TOUCHSCREEN: Normally I would find touchscreen on a laptop to be too fussy. But since we now have the atrocious Windows 8, which for some ungodly reason is completely catered towards touchscreen, it's almost a necessity. Windows 8 is HELL to navigate without a touchscreen. The touchscreen is also a little more comfortable to use than a mouse when merely clicking around on the internet. I WILL SAY that my laptop arrived with one dead pixel up near the top of the screen. Sounds stupid but it drives me nuts sometimes. I'm always wiping at it, thinking it's dirt, which just makes my screen click on something. *sigh* Also, for some reason the touchcreen spazzes if I'm trying to use it while I have my printer plugged into my USB. It registers my finger as touching the screen in five different places. Wat. No problem with flash drives or wireless mouses plugged in.KEYBOARD: The keyboard isn't the quietest thing, but it definitely isn't very loud and there isn't a big gap between the keys and the board they're rooted in, which means less dust and crumbs gets in there. Or maybe there's just as much and you don't see it. Either way, a plus. The keys aren't too slippery. I really like the feel and sound of this keyboard and since I do a LOT of writing on my computer, that's something that's a big deal for me, nitpicky as it sounds.FINGERMOUSE: The way your finger slides over the mousepad is smooth, although the matte black of the pad means that you'll leave grease marks no matter how clean your fingers are. Now, you can just tap your finger on the pad to click on something, which is a feature that Mac computers SORELY LACK. However, the pad won't always respond to that. AS FOR THE CLICKER THINGS. They're really loud. I feel like I'm clicker training a dog. Don't use them if you have someone sleeping next to you. Or in the same room. Or on the same floor. I have no idea why they're this loud; its entirely unnecessary.POWER CORD: It's kinda short.USB SLOTS: Four.CD DRIVE: It's got one.NOISE: It's pretty quiet. I mean, you can tell the thing is on, but it doesn't sound like a jet going off.SOUND: This is going to sound strange, but I can't 100% find them. There are some slots on the bottom, but I'm pretty sure those are for emitting heat. I mean, why would sound come out of the bottom? Come to think of it, why would heat? There are some more slots on the left side, but when I bent over to look, hot air blew into my eye. I don't think hot air is supposed to come out of speakers. But sound does definitely come out of this device.Update: I found the speakers. They're in a.... strange spot. They're on the front side of the laptop, at a downward-facing angle. So that's why sound was a little muffled when I would watch videos in bed. I honestly don't know why they put them there.MISCELLANEOUS: The laptop is this matte black that really picks up fingerprints. It's also this dimpled texture that looks cool but probably wouldn't hold laptop stickers very well. The bottom of the laptop has this bar that is meant to prop it up slightly when resting on a level surface, such as a tabletop, but makes your legs sore after a while.Apart from the above, this computer works completely to my satisfaction.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "good laptop", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R2IA3PFZCRUAX8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Better than the lower model  i15RV-6143BLK , the CPU is better, I3 VS Pentium.

Looks like you were eating a greasy burger and french fries while working on a laptop, even from just one handling.  Only part of the computer that is finger-print proof is the keyboard. and oh, probably the bottom of the laptop stays pretty clean, too.Structure: CONS - no biggie, but the screen doesn't open up 180 degrees.  It opens probably 135 degrees and stops.Weight: on the heavier side - with the 10-key feature, the laptop is bigger.Sound: goodBattery: lasts for hours.  I have never tried to measure how long it lasts, but probably good 6hrs for regular browsing and office work. (if you buy this, go to the battery setup and adjust so that you can extend your battery life - somehow it doesn't come with recommended setting pre-selected, so you have to change TO the recommended setting manually. Or mine didn't anyway)Screen: PROS - nice and big  CONS - tough screen, so you will see your finger prints. (it really shows when screen is off)  Also, you may see your own reflection depending on what you have on your screen and the lighting situation. (think how Plasma TV is likeTOUCH Screen: Just like your smart phone.  responsive.  If you are looking to upgrade to WINDOWS 8, I suggest going with touch screen.Keyboard: PROS - light and nice.  has 10-key, which is nice for people who is planning to do a lot of data entry or like that feature.  CONS - no back-lit feature. (which is not essential, and it's completely understandable that it didn't come with this computer of this price)Touch Pad: PROS - nothing special.  CONS - 1) left and right Clicker is SUPER loud compared to standard.  If you are in a quiet public place, people would probably give you a dirty look if you used the clicker buttons. (solution - you can set your touch pad to do right clicking and left clicking for you...I think... such as by double tapping it)  Cons 2) Because of the 10-key to your right, and the pad is set at the center in relation to the keyboard (not including the 10-key), touch pad is located a little off-centered towards left.  I think this is normal for keyboard with 10-key, but I thought to mention it. 3) Sensitive - combined with trying to learn Windows 8, the touch pad seemed to direct me to all kinds of places I didn't want to navigate to, so I had struggled with that.  I ended up adjusting touch pad setting a few times.  I also figured out that the feature of sliding your finger on the screen from left to right to move from one app to another was causing problem somehow, because every time my mouse pointer wondered over somewhere far left of the screen, I was navigated to another app window.  I un-selected the feature (sorry, don't remember where that was), and I stopped having the problem.WINDOWS 8: CONS - it takes a lot of getting used to.  A lot of adjusting and lot of frustration.  BUT just like anything else, you will adapt before you know it.  and IF you are going to go with Windows 8, you have to go with touch screen.  I think it would be very hard to operate Win 8 without touch screen.  I just dealt with issue where touch screen was not working (once pending Microsoft updates were installed and got rebooted, it came back.)  and it was not fun to try to go through it without touch screen.  I have had this for 2 months and had heck of a time adjusting to it.  but boy, when I lost touch screen feature temporarily, it was like as though I have never operated a computer without touch screen feature.Windows 8 doesn't have the \"start\" button anymore.  I think it's available with Win 8.1???  Free upgrade to Win 8.1 is offered, but from the site I bought my laptop from, there were some people commented that they had hard time upgrading it from 8 to 8.1.  Some people had no problem.  I think the key is to follow suggested steps by Microsoft and DELL before upgrading it.  But I am fine with Win 8 for now.  Definitely backup the computer before you try upgrading it.WINDOWS 8 PROS - If you just cannot get used to it, it gives you a little break in \"desktop\" window.  Still no Start button, but it looks familiar, with status bar on the bottom and desk top short cut icons.  I finding myself resorting to it when I have to get technical with the laptop.  It's just easier to navigate in that window.MICROSOFT OFFICE - CONS - Windows 8 doesn't recognize OFFICE 2010 I have .  It tells me that I need to get OFFICE 2013.BROWSER - CONS - came with Internet Explore and looks completely different with the web address showing on the bottom.  I didn't like that there weren't tabs on top, either.  I just wanted the old way for web purpose and didn't want to even mess with this.  SOLUTION - I downloaded Opera Browser.  Even if I didn't use Opera Browser, as long as I have it installed on my computer, the Internet Explore started opening in the desktop window with tabs....just like good old days!Other PROS worth mentioning:Come with CD/DVD drive, which is a rare feature to find in this price range.fan- very quiet to my standard.  Very happy with itTemp - this laptop runs really cool.  It gets just a litlle warm.  Never hot.  Impressed as my previous laptop used to get so hot.OVERALL, this is a really good computer for the price.  I was forced to get a new laptop due to ended support for XP.  I had never paid more than $50 for a laptop before(all used).  Technology seems to evolve and change so fast that I didn't want to pay too much money for something that would be come antique in just a few years.  At the same time I didn't want it to give me problem either.  I cannot believe I got a touch-screen laptop with all the features and a DVD/CD drive for $400!  I believe I made a really good choice.  I once considered a tablet, but it didn't have enough memory to handle all the pics and musics I wanted to save on the computer.  6GB RAM would have gotten me faster system, but this 4GB RAM just do fine for me.  still plenty fast.  Probably not for gaming, so I was told.  It will take a lot of patience and a lot of practice to adjust to Windows 8.  Or maybe it won't be a struggle at all for some people.  If you are good with giving Windows 8 a shot, this is a great buy.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$579.99", "Features": "Intel Core i3-3217U Processor\n15.6\" diagonal touch-screen display\n4GB DDR3 SDRAM / 500GB Hard Drive\nBuilt-in HD webcam and microphone / DVD\u00b1R/DVD\u00b1R Double Layer Drive\nWindows 8 Operating System / Bluetooth wireless", "Name": "Dell Inspiron i15RVT-6143BLK 15.6\" TouchScreen Laptop PC - Intel Core i3 / 4GB DDR3 / 500GB HD / Windows 8 (Black Matte with Textured Finish)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41pJkTjo91L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GMWK71M"}}
