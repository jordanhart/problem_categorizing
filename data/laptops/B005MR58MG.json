{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very identical to a macbook air but with windows 7!", "Author": "DRK_TECH", "ReviewID": "R33RMO288S3YVQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an IT professional and VERY picky when it comes to my laptop. I read the reviews on this and was mixed between the good and bad on here, so I decided to visit a Microsoft Store and check it out on my own. I immediately was amazed how thin and light this was just like a MacBook Air (which I used and had before).  I compared this to the Samsung series 9 laptop and although yes I wish it had a non-glossy screen it still beats it in price tag and performance.Pros:-Laptop does not show any traces of fingerprints (which annoyed me with other laptops)-Screen is very crisp and clear. Yes, its glossy but its a \"comfortable glossy\" like the macbook air-Keys are very responsive and comfortable. You do have to press a bit more but I easily got used to it.-The touchpad is the best I've ever used on any Windows laptop. Very smooth and responsive like a macbook.-Great performance as it has the i5 processor-Super fast bootup and screen on/off time-Simple and basic in terms of ports (2) USB and HDMI which are positioned perfectly in the back. I see no need for laptops to have tons of ports on the sides and back adding bulk to it.-For this price its a steal compared to what other manufacturers are charging.Cons:-The up/down/left/right keys are tiny, but eventually you get used to it-Battery life is not as long as MacBook Air but its still descent for an ultrabook.-Yes, its true that the click button below the touchpad you have to press very hard (mostly for a right click), however if you go into mouse settings and just enable \"single tap\" and set up \"double tap\" as a pop up menu, you will have no need to press down on pad at all.  This has such amazing trackpad drivers that I can glide through pages and screens with no effort.Overall, don't let the Acer name or price fool you, this laptop is a gem and best design, performance and feel I have ever seen outside of Apple.  I bought mine from a Microsoft Store which has the Microsoft Signature service (basically they re-load the OS with no bloatware).  If your in the market for a Windows 7 thin, fast and on the go laptop, this is the one for you!", "Date": "November 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelent!!", "Author": "Sol Botindari", "ReviewID": "R1Z8CU2J9VL237", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had this ultrabook for a week now and I can say it's amazing so far. It's thin, light, fast and comfortable. It looks good, it's quiet and cool (I mean temperature). Before I bought this I read all the reviews available online. I completely understand the reviewers have to criticize something but for me this computer works perfectly well. For example, many people say that the keys are too short. In my opinion the keys are comfy. The screen is not the best, but it's very good. This is not a gamer computer; it's for the ones that need to carry it from one place to the other. Taking into account its size and weight, I couldn't expect more from this machine. I come from a ThinkPad that is a heavy duty. I can see this computer is not as strong as the ThinkPad, but it's on a different league if you take into account the price you pay for one of the smallest computers available.The Core i5 it's powerful enough for the tasks I perform (Web, Excel, Word, some Photoshop). The SSD for \"instant on\" works as magic. You open the computer and its right there asking for your password (if you setup one). Battery life seems to be good although I can imagine it will suffer in the long term as I'm not able to remove the battery when it's plugged in. On normal use (internet, mail, and few YouTube videos) you get between 4 and 5 hours. I haven't tried playing a movie yet, but I guess you'll get enough power to watch it all the way.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "I'm really enjoying it so far", "Author": "Charlie", "ReviewID": "R2M2S7PC3RBRI4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "So, I won this thing on the Acer A Day Give Away. (So - I might be a little biased, cause they just gave me a free computer.)I was sort of in the market for a new laptop, and I really was not looking for a ultrabook. I'm more of a big clunky machine with a  big screen and all the bells and whistles type of guy.Imagine my surprise when I got this thing and have found that I really, really like it. I don't have an issue with the noise, nor do I mind the lack of CD drive. I think the start up time is fast, and the laptop overall is a great little machine. It feels really sturdy to me, despite the light weight. I really like that it does not get hot... like, at all. I had it running on battery power for nearly 4 hours the other day, shut it off, and felt the underside. It was tepid.I read reviews before I got the laptop that the keys were an issue. Some people complained about the keys not having the right amount of heft, which caused them to miss keys, or were unable to hit the arrow keys. Again, I like big things. Big keyboards included. That said. I don't have an issue, at all with the keyboard. I've not had any problems with the arrow keys. In fact, my only issue so far is that there are no dedicated function keys. There are function keys, but they're not dedicated (That is - I'd like to have a volume control, playback controls for video, etc.)I'm a big fan of the multitouch trackpad. I love that I can use gestures to make stuff happen. Took me a while to figure out how to use them correctly, but now that I have, I'm enjoying it. My only complaint is that you cannot create your own gestures, and can only use a predefined list of finger motions to trigger a predefined list of actions -- at least, using the stock software (I do not know of alternate software at the moment).Beyond that, it came with a lot of bloatware. Easily fixed, but a minor annoyance.___________________Edit: Exactly one year to the day after I received this thing, the trackpad stopped functioning properly and I cannot penetrate ACER's paywall to their warranty support. Absolutely no one has helped me with this. They're being very, very unhelpful and that has completely changed my opinion of this product.I would not buy this computer again, nor would I have any future business dealings with ACER because of their (obviously) well timed product failures, and refusal to help their customers.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Defective Hardware -- Be Wary!", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "R2ZLP6OHB936W", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the laptop for $799 on Amazon.com around Jan 2012. After it arrived, it worked OKAY. The track pad was not nearly as responsive as in a larger laptop, or in a MacBook Air, but no big deal.  I can adjust to that, and I did.  But there were significantly worse problems.First problem - Defective Wireless Card. (See also, e.g., the 2-star review by \"The Inveterate Scofflaw 'J'\").  On random occasions, perhaps once every one to three hours of use time, the wireless adapter just goes out.  *POOF*  No, it is not that I went out of network range, etc. Rather, the computer acts as if I had manually disabled the wireless, and there is nothing that can be done to bring it back.  Rebooting will work, and I realized later that putting the computer to sleep, which takes much less time, will also cure the nuisance. So I have had to do that, usually once every several hours, randomly, whenever the wireless card craps out on me. This was not a big deal, as it usually takes no more than 10-15 seconds total to put the computer to sleep and wake it up.  The quick sleep-awake response, to be fair, is a nice aspect of this computer.Second problem - Defective Hard Drive. (See also, e.g., the 1-star review by \"frank\"). About one month after getting this computer, I was using it on the train when all of the sudden I got a blue screen. Upon reboot, I keep getting an error message and windows will not boot. I google the error message, and learned that it was indicative of hard drive failure, and that other people whose laptops sustained a physical impact have had that message.  My computer never fell.  As a result of this, I shipped the computer in to Acer, and they ended up replacing the hard drive (just as I figured). So all my data was lost. Not a big deal, I only had it for a month, but still, but be warned!My computer arrives in two weeks or so, and the invoice says that a new hard drive was installed. So far so good, but one day later, the computer starts doing clicking sounds randomly, and then I get a blue screen. Upon reboot, the clicking sounds (which are annoying an scary, think about fingernails on chalkboard) continue and I get an error message about have no boot drive.Conclusion: This computer was a bad decision, and the problems discussed herein are likely a product of Acer trying to use sub-par technology in an ultra-thin laptop. MacBook Air laptops, for example, all have solid state drives -- no disk drives. I think having an actual disk drive in such a thin computer is asking for trouble. Similar issues may have been with the poor contact between the wireless card and the mainboard.At any rate, I am happy that Amazon.com has a very easy return policy for defective computers.", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is it for the price", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2PHVJVACVH6D5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I usually do not write reviews, but felt what I read was not correct.  This computer is great.  The keyboard which some have said is bad is not the case.  I had an Apple laptop and found it similar.

The speed and connection are great!!  I did a lot of research before buying and when I clicked send in the buying cart, I initiallly had remorse as I was wishing that I was being too cheap and a few hundred would have made my life complete.  When i got the computer.  What a great surprise. The top is great.  As for plastic, it does not feel cheap, but smart in cost. Also, my Mac was hot on the bottom, this computer is cool on bottom.  Not sure why but it is.  The layout is great. The hinge is fine, no problem that I see that some reported.  Love the keyboard, which the experts said was lacking. Still not sure what they are talking about. I can buy almost two of these computers for what the others are charging.  No Brainer!!  Buy it!!  P.S. They came out with a new one that is $1400 with SDD and i7.

The keyboard looks very nice, like the Mac keyboard, however, it seems I had to press it very hard and right in the middle, otherwise, I will miss keys. It seems the issue is the key only works when you press the center part and hard enough. If you accidentely pressed the corner, you will miss the key @ 80% of the time, especially on keys: 'N', 'M', 'Dot', 'A'... because you had to reach out your finger to those keys and very likely you will miss them. I liked this laptop so much that I was trying to force myself to get use to the keyboard, however after 1 month , I gave up and had to return it...I researched the market extensively after that trying to find a similiar laptop... and eventually I had to come back to Acer S3 since it's simply the best deal in the market. I also read tons of reviews online, some of them complain about the keyboard issue liked me and some claim the keyboard works perfectly, which made me wonder, maybe I got a defect one, so I decided to give Acer S3 one more try.Thanks to Costco, I got a new Acer S3 right away. I drove back home, unpacked it, turned it on and opened a notepad and started tying.... WHAT A HUGE SURPRISE, THE KEYBOARD WORKS GREAT for me this time! It is indeed like most of other reviews said, it's very comfy to type on, I still need to press a little bit harder than usual, but it's very easy to get used to and the most important thing is, I don't miss key this time, even when I pressed at the very corner of the keys. Note, I type super fast and that's why the keyboard is very important to me, and I can tell you this, this keyboard works GREAT!All I want to say is both the good and bad reviews of the Acer S3 keyboard are true, depending on which one you get. Don't be stopped by the bad review and if you did get one with keyboard issue, I would recommend you to exchange one, and you will be happy with what you get. :)", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Computer", "Author": "Jimmi", "ReviewID": "RPD4SJB7UOYSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is great.Pros: Very lightweightGreat battery lifeHDMI portFeels pretty well builtCons: bloat... but it's expected.Nothing else really comes to mind.There was someone complaining about the lack of an ethernet port, but it's really to save space.

I have been using computers (pc and laptops) for decades, and I am working in the Research and Engineering so I rely on computers more than the average. I will list pros and cons with reasoning. I am hoping this review helps you with your laptop hunting. Good luck.ProsWeight - Obviously this laptop is very light. Typically light electronics suffer from stability and it becomes rather fragile but this laptop is very study. The back and front side is protected by the thin aluminum / Chromium alloy casing and the back side is even more sturdy as it is a little bit thicker.Battery - Battery is very efficient. It seems to be lasting up to 4.5h with mild and 3h with heavy applications (such as video, or gaming)The hardware - The hardware is obviously is not the top of the line but Acer tries to close this gap using virtual memory from the hard drive (20gb of space for the virtual memory). So to an extend, the speed and the computer power have been maximized. This computer can handle decent games, all programs including illustrator etc.The Heat test - The laptop is not overheating. This is important as most of the thin products overheats within a hour. Acer is solving this problem with their patented heat sink design. Thats a big plus.- Keyboard - I have big fingers and this keyboard is perfect. Keys are well separated and very practical. However, page up and down keys are poorly located and tiny.Cons:- Sound: Even though the laptop's sound system is from Dolby, the sound quality is lower than average laptop. However, if you are using headset, the sound quality is better than average laptop. The speakers are small (to make it compact) but had to be loud enough: For that reason, they are failing most times.- Screen: Screen is glossy looking. I dont mind this, however if you are not in love with iphone's glossy look (or ipad, ipod etc) this screen is not meant for you.- Location of the USB port: It is located at the back of laptop. So when you are using your laptop, the access is limited. Also since the laptop is so thin, my keychain USB is not very easy to plug it in.", "Date": "January 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "It does its job!", "Author": "J.

Hsu", "ReviewID": "RCRSIRYZ14QHE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Recently bought this and have been using it 10-12 hrs a day for about 2 weeks now.My opinion is that all the 1 or 2 star ratings are most likely because of defective units. ALL computers/laptops will have a percentage of defective units. Acer is no different.All other reviews on S3 have touched on various pros and cons. So, I will just focus on my experience with \"cons\" that were mentioned by other reviews.Keyboard works fine for me and I type 40-50 wpm.Touch pad is surprisingly the best I've used, very responsive to a point that I can understand why some would think it's too sensitive.  It's just a matter of adjusting one's own touch.Screen resolution is more than adequate on a 13\" screen.  I was a bit hesitating about this but now I have no issue with it.Battery drains fast if you crank up the screen brightness all the time.  If you adjust it so it is \"just bright enough\" when lighting condition changes, you will get a decent 5-6 hours of use easily.Metal/plastic construction is MORE than solid.  A little give here and there on plastic parts when pressed hard...nothing to worry about.  Personally, I'd choose light weight materials over metal.Finally, the most talked about compromise of SSD+HD combo in term of performance.  To me, this is just debating between a car that can do 0-60 in 5 seconds and another can do it in 7 seconds.  98% of normal driving in daily life does the 2 second performance really make a difference?  Minimal.  I have a SONY with i7 core and SSD.  I don't feel my SONY is that much faster unless I am running some serious applications and I time it with a stopwatch.  That's the only time I see the performance difference.This is the best bang for the buck Ultrabook to get now.I took 1 star off because out of the last two weeks when I put it to sleep roughly 20 times each day, I've experienced about 3 incidents that it became unresponsive and I had to reboot.", "Date": "March 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "ordered twice both were DEFECTIVE", "Author": "Arhtu", "ReviewID": "R1T8CP340DZJ2L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "1st laptop, the network adapter was defective, wifi connectio gets dropped now and then,the system has to be restarted2nd laptop, when the lid is open beyond 90 degrees, the display blanks out:(Liked the design,light weight and instant start in this next gen laptop, too bad it was not built durable, thanks to amazon and i can return them, unlike bestbuy where there might be restocking fee and crappy customer service to put up with.", "Date": "March 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's great but extremely noisy", "Author": "TA", "ReviewID": "R2TMKITB1PVRB4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well, everything positive is already said and I've nothing to add on this - it's a really awesome laptop for a reasonable price except one big issue: effing NOISE.

I still wanted a mobile, small, lightweight PC to use with software that comes in PC form.  The Aspire S3 comes close - far from perfect, but it will do for what I need.  The form-factor is nice - I especially like the aluminum lid - but he rest of the machine does feel pretty plasticky - it is really a plastic body, with an aluminum sheet on the lid.  It does not carry the robust feel of my Macbook Air - so I sometimes feel I have to treat it somewhat gingerly.  Everything works fine (once you remove all the bload-ware that comes pre-loaded) - I was a bit surprised by how often the heat fan kicks in even when doing the most basic tasks.  The battery life is at best 'OK' - so far I am lucky to get much more than a couple of hours out of it when browsing or word-processing.  Would not call it lightning fast - resume from sleep is fast, but performance is again 'OK'.  There are a couple of things I don't particularly like about the design - first the touchpad is on the one hand way to sensitive - it's easy to move the cursor or accidentally click while typing or moving around the screen.  On the other hand the touchpad is a bit stiff when you want to right-click - you really have to press quite hard - which is especially difficult when trying to select a region.  If you use a mouse, it is much easier.  The other thing I don't care for in the design is the positioning of the USB ports at the back.  They are stiff (tough to get the cables in and out) and they are too close to the power cable - which has a big old connector that gets in the way.  You have to arrange the cables in such a way that the machine sits flat on the desk.  For $900 it is a bit on the pricy side when compared to what you can get from Apple (admitedly their equivalents are over $1000) - so if I were chosing I would probably save for a couple more months and spring for the Mac.  Peformance-wise you can get the same for much less than $900 in the PC world - but if small form-factor and relative light weight is a big deal, then this machine is pretty good.  In short, you are paying to for the cool 'Air-like' look - but that look is pretty superficial - a bit like having a sexy Mustang, but with a Ford Focus engine in it.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not 3 lbs...", "Author": "Cee H", "ReviewID": "RL6B645LHOFMW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Revised: Acer Aspire S3-951-6646 Ultrabook  I took off 1 star for a heavy charger & another for a wonky keypad. I originally took 2 stars off because I bought this for travel and weight was a primary consideration-- It was advertised as 3.1 lbs, but discovered the charger cord with it's brick and heavy 3-prong plug weighed in at a whopping 12 oz. so the real weight nearly 4 lbs. I also have to carry an 2-prong adapter for the 3-prong plug which makes it heavy, cumbersome and needs about 4 in. clearance from the wall.

MS Retail store is carrying 20% off on 500$ or more. 25% off on 1000$ or more.Here is what i did1. Bought this machine2. took there Microsoft Assure Plan worth 200$ - which provides 2 years extended warranty including accident coverage and a MS office software.3. That brought my total to 1100 and with discount of 275$ brought it down to 825. So the total I paid was 825+40$ = 865$ (which prints laptop price to 674$).4. If you simply buy the laptop, then it will be even 100$ less, but remember this are new genes of machine and you never know what may break.5. It is still much better deal than what Amazon is offering. If you dont have MS Store around than Amazon is the 2nd best.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Looking for performance, features and design this one's for YOU!", "Author": "RTyler \"T2\"", "ReviewID": "RM5ZCL2EQQWVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're coming in from the Desktop or casual dual core laptop that did the job, you're in for a most pleasant surprise.  We all knew it was just a matter of time before the laptops of yesterday got more portable, lightweight and powerful.  The Acer S3 did it with class.  I got mine a few weeks ago and began to load the 320 gig hard drive with all my \"stuff\" from an older Gateway laptop through the on-board system transfer software.  After completion I began to test some of the largest spreadsheets and power graphic projects I have been working on and they all excelled faster, clearer and with less wait time during conversions than before, and it barely put a dent in the hard drive space.  It also boasts a 20 gig solid state drive.  Basically that's a secondary drive that stores your data for quick starting...it takes like 2 seconds to start after shutting the case closed.  It has a lot of other great features too.I saved the best for last....This thing looks awesome!!!  When you slide this little gem into the cuff of your hand and walk into a room...all eyes go wide and are their mouths quickly follow suit.

Level 2 tech support agrees that there should be Bluetooth but \" engineering\" is closed till 3rd jan and they will figure out why Bluetooth hardware is not there in my laptop.B) the laptop has only a HDMI output.

Worked fine with projectors (Dell) but did not work with Acer external monitors.

The laptop broke down unexpectedly one day, it has booting problems. I issued a repair case with Acer, they did not email me shipping instructions until I contacted them again a week later.

Hope Acer doesn't give me more headaches in the future.____________________I bought this laptop right here from Amazon. The complaints about bad customer service and defective parts on this site did scare me off at one point, but I've given full consideration and compared it with many other ultrabooks, I believed Aspire S3 was the best of them all and had to give it a try. It's been only three days since I received the laptop so it is still in early stage of experiencing the device, but I gotta say I LOVE it.I really like the exterior design. It looks a lot like a Macbook Air, only a shade dark (the picture on this site makes it look light silver, but it's really not, it's a much darker silver/grey). I really like the touchpad so I hope it doesn't stop working one day.The small arrow keys are not a problem for me. The only key on the keyboard that I always miss hit is the Backspace, it seems to be so far out, and I do think the keys on the keyboard are a little widespread. But I guess I can always get used to it.Another minor problem I've noticed was that sometimes when I click something, it doesn't click, I have to click harder the second time to make it work. I keep thinking maybe it's that I clicked too light the first time, or maybe it's the laptop's problem. But because it doesn't happen frequently and the most I need to do is click twice, I don't think it's a big deal.Three days into using it, so far so good. It was very easy to set up; I deleted all the software that came with but I'm not interested in; the screen was very bright (I had to turn it down below half brightness because it was THAT bright);the battery lasts a long time even when I was watching movies on Netflix._______________________________________________________Now I've used the laptop for a week, I realized it's got a bigger problem.The internet keeps disconnecting, that happens quite frequently, like 5 times a day, even though every time it recovers on its own within half a minute, but what's the deal?

Other than those issues, I'm still somewhat satisfied with this computer.My main purpose and use for this computer is schoolwork, so with that being said I am able to get my work done and it does serve its intended purpose. I would suggest if you want a better sound to use a bluetooth earpiece or some earbuds, otherwise the factory speakers suck.  As for the wireless card installed in the computer you have to play with it for a bit and eventually it will stop kicking you off the internet.Make sure you have some type of virus scan on this computer.  I'm not really sure why but it seems that this computer is prone to viruses.  I won't make any suggestions but it does come with a 30 day trial of McAfee that you can purchase at a very good price due to the deal they have with ACER.Again overall I am fairly pleased with this computer.  This is my first ACER product and I hate to say it, it may very well be my last.  I don't hate it, but I can't say that I really love it.  Do your homework and make sure you make the purchase that best suits your needs.  I would suggest this as an excellent first computer for your child that is in school.", "Date": "January 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly", "Author": "Gieshadoll", "ReviewID": "RTFWTYTRVDDAQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok. First of all let me say that I went from an Ibook G4, a heavy clunky dinosaur, to this modern ultra lightweight computer. I really like the computer a lot, I had to relearn how to use a pc after having a Mac for so long, but I do really like it. It fast, I like the track pad, and it's easy to navigate. I have had no problems with the software other than my computer does freeze up a bit more than I would like, and it shouldn't since it's brand new, so that's pretty annoying. I don't look at porn on my computer, and I have a registry cleaner, good firewall, antivirus, blah blah blah.  The bad thing about this computer is that the battery doesn't last long AT ALL. Maybe an hour, maybe an hour and a half. This is the problem I had with my Ibook, which is why I got rid of it, but with a sleek, light computer, I guess they have to cut the bulk somewhere. They have also cut the bulk in the speakers, which are not loud AT ALL. Yes, I COULD buy external speakers, but I don't want to have to.

I actually purchased this ultrabook for very, very cheap from a Staples clearance, so I'm probably happier than most for this.I basically needed a light, portable laptop with sufficient processing power that I could bring to college - and for this purpose, this is PERFECT.But I would say that this Ultrabook doesn't give the \"full\" ultrabook experience.  As always, you get what you pay for.My review has a theme - and that is, its a great ultraportable, but not the premium experience you might expect from an ultrabook.Screen - Its merely decent.  Its not the worst I've seen, but far from the best.  I'm hoping next year we will see IPS displays standard.  Viewing angles are not very good, but decent enough so that you don't have to constantly adjust.  I expect this category to improve a lot in future ultrabooks.  For the price, I'm satisfied.  However, there IS an issue with the screen wobbling.  The hinge is simply too weak for this!  I've tried many other ultrabooks and they have far sturdier hinges.  Acer really needs to improve this, as the screen can jiggle constantly if it is not on a perfectly steady surface.Processor - Fast.  You don't really need to worry here, unless youre trying to do graphics/video processing.  Its very speedy for browsing/word processing/youtube.  Although its a last-gen i5, the newer gen isnt THAT much faster (Ivy bridge is just a die shrink of Sandy bridge + better graphics)Keyboard/trackpad - While other reviewers had gripes here, I actually LOVE the trackpad and find the keyboard fine.  The trackpad is programmable so you can do quite a bit with it.  I find it responsive, accurate, and fairly smooth.  Its not glass (but plastic), so its not super smooth like some other ultrabooks, but its good enough.  As for the keyboard, I also find it to be a nice typing experience.  The key travel isnt much, but its better than some other ultra thin ultrabooks, and sufficient once you get used to it (and this is coming from a person who uses a mechanical desktop keyboard).  I applaud Acer on their design here, as I find both the keyboard and trackpad to be of fantastic quality for a ultrabook in this price range.Battery life - Disappointed here.  I expect next-years ultrabooks to last much, much longer.  It only lasts about 3-4 hours depending on your usage.  I would like to see 6 hours minimum on high brightness levels/usage.. 3rd gen Ultrabooks are going to be spec'd minimum at '9' hours, so I'm expecting to buy another ultrabook next year.  As for their claim of 6 hours, that is pretty much if you have WiFi off and edit a word document on the lowest brightness settings.  Otherwise I could not see it happening.Build quality - Is fine.  Better than your average notebook, but worse than many other ultrabooks.  In general, it feels as sturdy as a regular notebook.  I found no flexing that would bother me.Noise level - This is actually my main problem here.  This ultrabook can get irritating in a quiet bedroom.  The fan spools up and has a high pitched noise, even when doing web browsing.  This is one part that really needs to be addressed.  This and the battery life is why I docked a star.To summarize, I gave this 4 stars because while it is imperfect, I don't expect perfect for the price of being the cheapest ultrabook on the market.  1 full star was docked because the fan has a high pitched noise, and the battery life should be at least 5 hours according to ultrabook spec, but it isnt.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Trackpad problem", "Author": "Ivan Aguilera", "ReviewID": "R2VTX80US3EEPX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The trackpad was unresponsive at times, getting the right click was tedious, I returned it because of that. despite that the machine has a beautiful design, ultra portable.", "Date": "May 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "pennycakes", "ReviewID": "RK8AQMTUUF7VS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop for me especially compared it to air. light, long battery life, fast, high value.

When I seen that it was an Acer I had to look the prodcut up to see what pc was being made that looked so stylish and thin.  The weight was a big issue to me in looking for a computer beccause with carrying loads of books and notebooks around I wanted something light. I read product reviews and did my research for approximately two weeks. Being that weight and size were an issue to me, I read every review I could.  Not to discredit anyones views but I do feel some are a little over the top in things they do not like.  The review about the charger being 4 lbs is just not accurate in my opinion.  The charger is only slightly bigger than that of a netbook charger.  It is also not that heavy either in comparison with traditional laptop chargers.  This one could fit into my purse comfortably and I not know it.I am giving this review five stars despite it getting an Atheros wireless adapter malfunction in the beginning.

Two days after I began using the laptop, the trackpad began acting rather erratically. The pointer would jump suddenly or get stuck on one corner of the screen. The trackpad would then become unresponsive and I'd have to wait a couple of seconds before I could use it again. I really rather liked the feel of this ultrabook; it felt sturdy. But the trackpad's lack of responsiveness started to really get to me after a while. I'm not sure if other folks have had this experience, but I had wanted so much to keep the laptop and had hoped that the trackpad thing was just a glitch. So I hung on to it for a few more days, thinking it would go away. And it would, for a while, and then return. I must've gotten a lemon.-----I just received this laptop today. These are my first impressions. (I'll update my review as I start using the unit for classes this coming week.) The laptop is very thin; yes, it's less than an inch. I'm typing on my i5 Toshiba satellite right now, with the Acer sitting next to it and the difference in thickness is amazing. The laptop is also very light and though it has a little bit of that \"plastic\" feel to it, it's still a rather beautiful machine. There's just a little hint of heat on the left underside, but it's definitely tolerable. It does wake up quite fast when you open the lid, most of the ports (two 2.0 usb and 1 hdmi) are at the back (the earphone jack is on the left side and the SD card slot is on the right). Like one reviewer said, the SD card slot doesn't allow the card to slide in completely, so it's left sticking out. I guess one will just have to be mindful of the fact if a card is left in there. I'm not sure yet about how long the battery lasts as I just turned it on about an hour or so ago. The keys are good, except the arrow keys which are a tad too small for me, but again, it's not going to be a problem. The trackpad is just one big square, no separate left and right buttons. It was tricky using it at first, but you get used to it after awhile. The screen is glossy; again, not a big problem for me, though I know some folks who prefer non-glossy screens. The size of the screen is quite good, not too small, not too big. [At this point, the only thing I'm not liking is the bloatware - hence the 4/5 stars - which I'm going to slowly work on to remove of course; plus the fact that the hard drive which is supposed to be 320 gb only actually shows up being 280 gb. Now I know a lot of it is used for necessary computer software and whatnot, but that's an entire 40 gb that I can't seem to account for. (Again not a very big problem as I don't intend to load a whole lot of stuff on the computer as I just need it for travel and library/research purposes; still, if someone could help clear this up for me. I just want to know why this seems to be more particularly pronounced with Acer products. The Toshiba's I've used don't seem to have as much as 40 gb \"missing\" or \"unaccounted\" for when you buy them. Anyone who can help clarify this?

There's really no point to go into the positives if the most basic functions like the keyboard and mouse pad are not usable.Keyboard:I read about the potential \"getting used to\" on the keyboard but didn't realize it's that bad.  Certain keys would not register UNLESS you have to be precise on the where your fingers land on the keys.  This seems to affect certain keys on the keyboard.  So imagine if you're a fast typist like me and constantly second guessing yourself on which key you hit and or you will need to constantly go back to correct yourself.  This is just insane. If you havfe carpal tunnel syndrome don't even consider this laptop. The keyboard was so bad that I had write this review on my desktop, it was just that frustrating.Mouse Pad:The mouse pad is a single piece design and it's integrated with the left and right button.  The problem is that it's big enough where you accident hit the right side and right click appears accidentally.  Seems to be better with the tap click featured disabled but it's not really a true solution. Also, mouse clicks is not as sensitive as it should be so you need to press harder.  I found highlighting text very difficult and you have pay extra attention to get the job done.Other issues (not a showstopper but I personally didn't' like)Build QualityThe build quality is on the cheap side, so look like an Apple Mac Air it's certainly doesn't feel like one.  The case shell feels more plastic than alloy. If you seen the Mac Air you can easily feel the difference.  Granted the Air book is about double the price of this ultrabook so just want to clear up some expectation.Screen resolutionDepending on what you used in the past this may or may not be a problem for you.  At first I thought the resolution won't be an issue since it's a smaller 13.3\" inch screen and found the display space is not adequate for my needs using the native resolution/lcd size combo.Screen viewing angleIt seems like I have play with the view angle on this laptop more to get it right otherwise it's appears to be washed out towards the bottom of the screen.  This is annoying since it's not the normal viewing angle and you have to push the LCD more back to get it right.Sound systemIs this just a gimmick with this \"Professional\" tuned Beat Audio thing?  I found the sound horrible almost sounding like mono.  I have a 5 year Lenovo T61 with better audio.  Perhaps this is due to the fact the the speakers are at the bottom of the laptop which makes it sound muffled.  This is also a horrible place to place the speakers.

My old HP notebook would be too embarrassing to take to school because of the poor condition that I had kept it in, so I needed a more public-ready one. It had been 3 years since my father had bought my last laptop and this time around I wanted to have a say in the choice of laptop knowing that if I had left it up to him, he would have simply bought whatever the retailers told him was 'hot'. This was my first time actually taking an active role in making such an important purchase decision. And because I was specifically buying this product for consumption in public places, there was a need to mix practicality with high amounts of esteem. The unit had to be:1) a brand that my peers would recognise2) polished and of high quality3) 14-inch, no larger4) NOT an Apple product, but could hold its own against it5) light and portable enough to carry around in a backpack6) able to do simple Word-Processing and web-browsing for the leastWith this criteria, I set out in search for the perfect laptop companion. Naturally, because of unsatisfactory experiences, HP was automatically removed from my mental list of options.Decision-Making Process:My first inclination was to get a Sony Vaio. They were readily available and the brand, to me, seemed favourable enough. Fortunately, I got the opportunity to see some Sony models at a local retailer and was not impressed at all by the outward appearance so the desire to get one quickly disintegrated. Prior to visiting the retail outlet, I had heard some talk about this Acer Aspire but purely because of the 'meh' brand name, I didn't even give it any serious thought. However, when I saw it at the retailer's that immediately changed. I loved that it had an aluminium finish and was very light and compact - it was directly out of my dream. Those were all the practical features that I was looking for but I could not bring myself to commit to the brand. To do so would largely betray the reason why I was even going through the trouble of sourcing a new laptop in the first place. Thus, I found comfort in a similar, yet much more elegant-looking Samsung Series 5 NP530U4C-A01US 14-Inch Ultrabook (Light Titan). Further research revealed that the product that I was actually searching for was a new product category called 'ultrabooks' of which both Samsung and Acer offered options.Up until the point of purchase, I debated back and forth on what was the best product for me. At one point, I was even considering substituting a laptop with a tablet-portable keyboard combo (no USB-input being the deal-breaker for that flawed idea). Finally, after viewing ultrabook reviews on Youtube I ended up reaching a compromise. The Samsung Series 5 model had a useless CD drive, was larger and heavier and carried a heftier price tag than the Acer Aspire. I decided that a 13.3-inch display was not significantly less than a 14-inch display and that I could function with the same 2 USB ports that I am already accustomed to. Perhaps the biggest compromise was that I settled for a 'bland' name device. The word 'Acer' doesn't seem to turn heads or conjure up images of superiority or relevance for that matter. But, for what it's worth, the device is more than well-made and fits my aesthetic ideal.Within a week of ordering my Acer Aspire, I had it in my hands.Product Review:Design-The device to me is very aesthetically-pleasing. I love the aluminium finish. To me that signifies a kind of serious classic sleekness. The extreme-thinness of it was the wow-factor for me. I just can't get over the fact of how slim this device is when compared to my HP notebook and even my friends' laptops. However, I don't think 'light' is necessarily the best way to describe this unit though. Holding this in one hand and my HP Pavilion in the other, I can only ascertain a slight difference in weight, much less than I would think there would be. I think a more appropriate term would be 'less cumbersome'. It is made up primarily of metal after all. In any case, it is extremely portable but doesn't appear flimsy. This is what truly matters.Keypad and Touchpad-This is my first time using a keypad with such flat keys ('chiclet' I believe it is called) so I have to adjust. I keep making mistakes, mostly because I don't tap a key hard enough. Hopefully, I will be able to reduce the number of errors as I get more acquainted with it. Potential customers note that the arrow keys are very small and that the 'Fn' shortcuts seem to be limited. For e.g. there is no shortcut to play/pause or stop music playing in the background like there is on my HP. The touchpad is also new to me (I am a mouse person) but I am adjusting very well to it. I like how we don't have actual knobs to the bottom of it.Display-It could be better. I find it hard finding a setting that I like. It's either too bright or too dark.Sound-Pitiful. It's definitely not the concert experience. I will be using this device for school work though, so listening to music or watching movies is not as important.Software-I had the worse experience with Microsoft Office Starter or whatever it is called. The first day I carried my laptop to school, it just wouldn't even open! I remember feeling buyer's remorse but I gave Acer the benefit of the doubt; this was not their fault. A lot of other programs came pre-installed, I believe these are referred to as 'bloatware'. I deleted some of them, only keeping things that I already use like Skype.Other experiences-In order to avoid repeating history, I am making a conscious effort to drain the battery of my laptop every time instead of having it perpetually plugged into an outlet. I am getting good battery life on the laptop right now and it doesn't take  long at all to recharge. But, the device is still in its infancy stage. It's cute and well-behaved now but who knows when it will become stubborn and incorrigible. I am already annoyed by the constant updating of anti-virus programs and the need to restart every other day when Windows has to install whatever, but I guess that is a trade-off of having an efficient device; a kind of necessary evil. It is important to mention that with all the hype about a less-than-2-sec awake from sleep mode functionality, I really don't see a difference in how long the Acer takes to how long my old HP takes. If there is, it's really insignificant to me.Overall:I would recommend this device to anyone. My quips with it are probably personal. I think Acer really created a star product here. It's not perfect but it does the job that I want it to do, and it looks good doing it. I've had it for a little over 2 weeks now. I named it \"Athena Amazonia\" and I hope that she will serve me well for the next 2 years to come. Only time will tell. I hope that this review will provide persons in a similar situation with some insight.Thanks for reading!", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "It doesn't worth it....

Right out of the box, it was nothing but trouble. The automatic update failed to update the usb ports so that nothing I plugged into them worked. I was on the phone with support for almost two hours trying to figure out that I needed new drivers. And Windows 8??? OMG that is the worst program I have ever seen. After spending the day doing things on it, I'm ready to pull what's left of my hair out.But the reason I'll be hauling myself down to the store and begging them to take it back and refund my money is that the power and usb ports are on the back of the machine, not on the side like they are for every other laptop I've seen. It doesn't seem like a big deal, but if you plan on using your laptop in bed or snuggled up on the sofa, anywhere that your body might come in contact with the back, forget it. It joggles the usb connections, making the attachment continuously unload and reload. The power cord has a small transformer close to the plug and it addition to the cord getting tangled up underneath the computer, I was constantly having the thing sit down wobbly because I sat it onto the desk and the transformer was under there. Continuous PITA to try and remember to pull the cord out of the way before setting it down on a surface. The port placement is completely impractical.

I spent hours today on the phone with them having me to factory reset my computer (they had to look it up to find out how that was done and I was already in the process of it being restored before they said go to start menu. It took me a couple of hours to remove stuff from my computer to my external (and i probably missed some stuff) plus i have to reload all my programming that the restore deleted. This would absolutely fix my dvd burner.......of course it didn't. Than i had to call back and I talked to another CRS to have him keep repeating (rudely)First he said i had to send my whole computer in, i refused, I had read too many bad reviews of people sending their whole computer in and the company saying it was banged up in transport and they had to have $200 to fix the cosmetic problems before they would fix internal problems. When I refused and asked for a new dvd burner sent to me with a return postage sticker so i could send my old one back he told me I had two options they could take my credit card number and put a hold of $150 and they could send out me out a new dvd burner and if i sent the other one back (like i have use for one that doesn't work) or I could send mine in and they would send me a new one out........I told him that that was unacceptable. I asked for his supervisor and the supervisor (another very condescending and rude person) would only repeat the same thing. I asked to be transferred to his supervisor and was told he answered to no one, and hung up on me. Than i called back and they had me uninstall and reinstall my dvd burner and that was a guarantee fix. It wasn't. I am at wits end what to do. I have read way to many reviews of people sending their stuff in and never getting it back and I will not pay $150 for something that you can buy in the store for around $50 and to top that off the way they run their business i would never give them my credit card number.

My problem is this - All of the hard work to make a thin and beautiful computer, to ruin it all with: USB 2.0 (I mean come on - there should not be such a thing! It's like putting in a DVD player - opposed to an integrated BD Player - on a brand new flat acreen 51 inch, LED, 1080p, 240hz TV).

Golly gee, they have BT 3.0?!\" Well, now Acer has BT 4.0!; yet, still using USB 2.0, and Regular HDD with a tiny SSD. No wonder it can get 50 days on Standby but only 6 hours (in perfect lab conditions) of continued use. They should havesubstituted it all with a SSD between 100-250 GB.

Maybe this is because I am used to the high, good quality definition of my netbook, but cummon, I can probably count the pixels on this. I am pretty up to date with technology, and comparing this to my smartphone screen definition, I feel like I am going back some years to those days when the color screen first came out for phones.I guess I won't be watching movies on this...Dolby home theater isn't that great either. I use a speaker, so that doesn't bother me as much as the screen is bothering me right now (and I can't really help that. I have to stare at it constantly... what am I gonna do..)If you are one of those people like me who think that it is very important for your laptop to have high definition screen, this isn't for you.But otherwise, the specs are good, cheaper compared to other ultrabooks, and I will manage with this.Not the greatest buy though..", "Date": "November 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awful noise", "Author": "fred01", "ReviewID": "R3HHVZNGR5L0YF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The noise of the fan is awful.
