Good wifi range.size makes the laptop very easy to transportCONS:Intel Atom CPU is not a Positive or a negative,its smooth and steady, fair for the price, but not FAST by any means.keyboard could have been layed out a little better. feels cramped.Afterall what do you expect for a budget laptop with 1GB of ramand a single core intel atom cpu @ 1.6ghz?????????Overall, i give this laptop 3 stars or a 7.5 out of 10.Its upto Par with other laptops in this class.Its Not the Worst, but its not the greatestI would recommend the laptop to a friend who was lookingfor a laptop on a budget of under $160.00Thanks for reading hope this was helpful. Good-day.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not bad for a simple work laptop", "Author": "RedConOne", "ReviewID": "R329HMQDH622QC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "As a simple laptop to carry around to work and not worry about breaking it due to its low cost this one isn't bad to have. I'd rather break this every time over any of my other more expensive laptops. With that said it does have built in wifi which can be helpful. As the other reviewer said it has a rather low processor. It doesn't offer much storage but then again there is a reason why they are cheap. This laptop is what i would consider for a work laptop that just needs simple internet connectivity and maybe a word program. This also wouldn't be a bad choice as a starter laptop for some kids, since it is cheap and kids usually destroy things.Overall it is OK it has many cons and a few pros. It will work as a beater laptop for work or kids. However as a personal laptop it is less than desirable. As work laptop for someone who does extensive work on computers you'll be frustrated with the simplicity and overall quality of this laptop. However as a work laptop for those whom need only a simple internet connection and word document this one will get the job done...just barely though.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004KRZOT6"}}
