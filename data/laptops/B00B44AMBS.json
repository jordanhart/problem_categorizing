Morgan", "ReviewID": "R1RCODLHWBHU0X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Yes, I know, a laptop under $400 -shouldn't expect much - and that is very true - you shouldn't expect much. We bought this for our 10 year old son. He has moved to a school which will require presentations (and they use PC / Windows 8) and he had asked for a computer for his birthday. We have been MAC users since 2005 - not because we 'love' MAC but because we moved to the States from England and our laptops crashed and we just tried MAC's. However, since getting this computer for our son and loading it up etc we have realized why the next computer he will get will be a MAC. The interface is horrible. Windows 8 is confusing. The feel of the laptop is uncomfortable and awkward to use. The load up time is painfully slow (and I mean PAINFULLY SLOW) - navigation is irritating. You're not sure whether the item you have downloaded (Printer Drivers for instance) have actually loaded - no indication that it has finished. Trying to find the settings was frustration as you have to move the cursor to the bottom right of the screen (who knew!!!!). My son uses PC's at school, and even he is sitting shouting the the computer trying to figure something out. It is just not intuitive to use. I should have realized something was up when a 10 min basic set up at Best Buy (a free service when buying a new laptop) turned into a 55 min set up with the assistant saying \"Never known a laptop be so slow\". This experience has made us more of a MAC snob. We will never by PC again - it is just too hard and frustrating and slow. Sorry son, we'll get you a decent computer next time.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B44AMBS"}}
