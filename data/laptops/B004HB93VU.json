{"Reviews": [{"Title": "LOVE it!", "Author": "Peggy", "ReviewID": "R3GIQE00WQGGNW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this factory refurbished at Best Buy for $499, (could get for about same price here, but wanted to have their 14 day \"touchy feely\" period to try it out at home and see if I liked it.  I've been researching laptops for awhile, Amazon is always helpful for customer reviews, and I found Cnet.com and PCmagazine.com the best for expert reviews.  But no matter how much research that you do, you will always find people who absolutely love each model, (or brand) or hate it.  Other reviewers of this computer on other sites absolutely raved about both it and the HP brand ... many said that they only would purchase HP's because they had bad experiences when they tried another brand.  But I think a lot of it comes down to individual expectation, experience, and preferences.  Personally, I love this laptop.  The 14\" screen is a perfect size for having it on my lap while curled up on the couch, and it's thin/small size makes it easy to carry along with me. I love how light it is, (around 4.4 pounds?) some of the others I was looking at were right at 5 pounds, and you wouldn't think that would make much of a difference, but each time I pick it up I'm amazed by how light it is.  It made with sturdy design - no cheap plastic here.  I really like the media keys up top, (volume) ... on my husband's brand new Samsung i7 laptop he has to use 2 hands to push the function key along with media key, while I can just hit media key alone.  Little things, but I like it.  I like the mouse pad as well, just enough sensitivity for me, (unlike my husband's Samsung, which isn't sensitive enough - but that is one of those personal preferences that will be different for everyone.  I am currently unemployed, so the computer is running 15 straight all day, every day, and I find that it runs very cool and quiet ... very different than my previous dell laptop which ran very hot and loud. I really wanted the WiDi technology so that I could watch the free hulu tv shows on my hdtv instead of my computer without needing cables, (this looks so awesome, by the way!)  You'd be hard pressed to find another Intel i5 Core Processor for under $500.  The only thing I wish it had was a backlit keyboard.  But the pro's of this awesome laptop far outways the cons.  I'm so happy that I bought it!!Added note on 1/23/12:  I wanted to come back and add to this review now that I've had a few more months to \"play\" with my new laptop.  I'm still thrilled with it - I'd increase my review to 6 stars if I had the option.  It continues to runs cool and silent, no matter how long it's been on.  The sound and picture are both great.  It is incredibly light and has a long battery life.  I continue to love the stand alone media keys.  I also like that they have a \"HP support\" link right on the computer, where I have the option of having an online chat with a real person at HP anytime, and if I'm having a specific technical issue with my computer, I can give my pc permission to transfer data to a HP support technician so they can help me resolve my issue.  I haven't had to use this feature yet, and hope I never will, but it's nice knowing it's there.  The only thing it's missing is backlit keys.  Other than that, for my needs it's perfect!  I absolutely love it!", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is an excellent computer for any need", "Author": "Jennifer Reavis \"Mom Of Three\"", "ReviewID": "RJTH4DJQVKMLH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was not my first laptop.  I have had many laptops over the years and this has been one of the very best. The durable aluminum construction is very stylish. The processor is fast and it has plenty of memory to spare.

The only thing that fry is one of the memory card which I have to replace it and now everything are fine. Fast, no lag, and good performance, but not for high quality gaming.

I loved the engraved prints on  the cover and the key board (palm rest part). I was debating between this and then much pricier and newer model of the toshiba satelite (forgot the exact model). My gut just told me to get this one. It was on sale too.It has been a year since I've bought this computer, and I love it! I don't usually waste time writing reviews that much, especially if I feel that I can't write a near perfect one,but I feel that the reviews for this product don't do it justice. I love everything about this laptop. It is fast, quiet, lightweight, user friendly (esp. the media keys), and aesthetically pleasing.Only flaw is that about a week after purchase, the computer wouldn't come back after going to sleep/hibernation. It was so frustrating. So I just turned the computer to never sleep, and the annoying problem went away. I don't use it on battery at all. I take the battery out and just plug it to the outlet, so i can't say much about battery life.But all in all, I'm so glad I chose this lap top when other people try to convinced me otherwise!", "Date": "September 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Decent Features, Lacks Charisma", "Author": "Jyoz", "ReviewID": "R2XTWONUH6DWOC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this PC in early 2011 to replace an older Dell Inspiron laptop. I chose this PC for several reasons (screen size, the i5 processor, the 4gbs of ram, the large hard drive size 640gb, etc.). After having it for a while there is a lot I have come to like and a lot which I have come to dislike.Pros:- Good processing power- Decent RAM- Clean looks, nice design- Compact (albeit a bit heavy).- Feels strong / made of good quality materials (except the keyboard -- which feels cheap).Cons:- Hard Drive. The HDD that came OEM with this was a 640gb Toshiba HDD which seems to have failed for several other people who also had it OEM in their HP or Acer laptops. HDD is not an Advanced Format HDD which made the data transfer process a bit harder (cloning). Anyways for me it failed shortly after my warranty expired (not surprising).- Clickpad. This laptop uses a Synaptics Clickpad with multi-touch functionality... it seems somewhat counter productive, overly sensitive, and frustrating to use. (Side note: it is also incompatible with other operating systems outside of Windows).- Heat. The laptop seems to run a bit hot when its not a cooling pad. Although, I did replace my HDD with a 7200 it doesn't seem to be the culprit as the HDD is the coolest thing my sensors read.- HP bloatware. There is so much bloatware pre-loaded on this machine when you buy it, it is not even funny.Overall, the product is good (it has the power to do what I need it to) but it kinda disappoints on a few levels. The hard drive failure was my biggest let down.", "Date": "September 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Never buying HP again", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "R30YM683L0231C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Has been nothing but trouble since I bought it.

Treating its customers with ignorance and in-acceptable response-times!Finally I exchanged the AMD board and put an intel board in - and the machine was more or less OK.At least I managed to survive aprox. 30 months this way.This year - I found the DM4 1265 at a Bestbuy in the US.I was fascinated by the slick aluminim design; some good ratings from other users.And although the vendor told me that HP would stand for \"Having Problems\" - I purchased my 2nd HP laptop.A very bad decision!!!The mousepad is extremely lousy;the harddisk failed after aprox. 4 months (Toshiba drive)and the equipment tends to get very warm; the fan runs all the time now.HP Latinamerica - in my case: Colombia - does not cover ANY warranty for equipment purchased in the US!So I bought another harddisk- which is working fine so far.And in the meantime, another HP device - my dsekjet F380 printer/scanner also broke: the electronic board is damaged and its repair would cost more than a new printer.Dear HP management: I will not buy any more of your equipment.  I had enough.Even if you give me a piece of equipment for FREE - NO thank you!Poor product quality in combination with a useless after-sales-service (technical service) are the reason for my decision.
