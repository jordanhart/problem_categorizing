In the last few weeks, though, I've been working on different notebooks at various Starbucks, Peets and similar locations with free WiFi, and I'm starting to see the point.Last Christmas, I upgraded from my tiny and very handy MSI Wind netbook to an HP DM3-1030us \"ultraportable\".  Like the Macbook Air, it doesn't have an optical drive, it has a relatively small 13\" screen, but it is pretty thin and light (and expensive-looking, even though it didn't cost more than a high-end netbook, and was 1/3 the cost of a MacBook Air.)  What it DOES have is enough portability to easily fit in my soft briefcase and leave room for a textbook or two, it has a dual-core CPU and discrete graphics so it performs pretty well, but these are all low-power devices (the CPU maxes at 1.6GHz!), so the normal battery easily lasts for more than 3 hours even with full screen brightness, wifi, and normal surfing/app use.  4GB of RAM and 320GB of disk space on a fast 7200rpm drive are improvements over the MacBook Air, as well.Even though we live in the modern Wifi cafe age, it turns out that *power outlets* are what are scarce.  With this HP, I never have to worry about not being near an outlet, because I can do a whole morning's or afternoon's work on the battery.  The keyboard is fine, and the notebook is small enough that it easily fits on whatever little euro-table the cafe provides, whether round, rectangular, or some funky shape.  The screen is bright, and just big enough to allow proper viewing of web pages and documents, which the 600-pixel-high netbook screen never quite managed.Unlike the MacBook Air, it's got lots of USB ports (one of which I use for a proper Logitech mouse), a memory card slot, and even HDMI to connect to a TV set!  If I need to use optical media, I just plug in a portable drive to a USB port, but almost all of the time, USB flash drives are plenty.Like I said, I finally understand the point of a MacBook Air, but I've found something even better.

The only (!) complaint I would have is that the speakers do not provide enough volume and I use it a lot for watching video tutorials at home via YouTube, so I have to grab my earphones and use them every time I watch one.The rest...?  A superb buy for the price, size and weight.  And yes, it does NOT have a CD/DVD drive inside (you may need to buy an external one) but I believe that using a CD is going to be less and less mandatory. I bought a neat and great looking silver plated Samsung LightScribe together with the Laptop for approx, 55 bucks if i remember right and used it the first day to load some software. Now it rests in my briefcase... one of these days it will be useful again, I believe... so you may want to buy one too.BOTTOM LINE: Love the Laptop, would like louder speakers, happy with my purchase and with Amazon's service.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Gotta love it !!!", "Author": "Jack M.

I wanted an affordable ultra portable for everyday use. This is a good machine. Beautiful to look at but it does have major flaws with the TOUCHPAD and BUTTONS that need to be addressed. Fortunately, I don't use it as my main machine, but if you are, I would try it out before you buy it. All the complaints and reviews about the touchpad is spot on. If this was my primary everyday machine, I would look elsewhere. But as an affordable supplemental machine, it work well for me.It doesn't have a DVD drive, but you can buy an external one anywhere from $45 to $60.My specs:1.6GHz AMD Athlon Neo X2 Dual-Core ProcessorATI 3200320Gb 7200RPMWiFi and Bluetooth4Gb of RAM DDR2Windows 7 Experience Index (3.5 Overall):Processor: 4.2Memory: 5.8Graphics: 3.5Gaming Graphics: 4.8Primary Hard Drive: 5.9Video PlaybackHULU HD - goodYouTube HD - 720p goodYouTube HD - 1080p no goodVLC -720p MKV goodVLC - 1080p MKV no goodWindows Media Player - WMV 1080p goodGames - I don't play games with this. I doubt it will play anything graphic intensive well. I have a Intel I7 920 desktop for that!Noise LevelMine is good. A tad bit louder than  my wife's Dell XPS M1330. At full CPU usage, the fan speeds up and the noise level increases but it's still relatively quiet. For most everyday use,  the fan is unnoticeable.TemperatureThe left hand rest warms up (not heats up) when running heavy tasks. But for regular daily use, it's barely noticeable. I ran Prime95 64bits version for 30 minutes running the processors and RAM at full capacity and the left palm rest warmed up a bit but not hot enough to bother me. (I returned a HP Touch Smart tx2z because the fan was too loud and temperature was unbearably hot).  This machine doesn't bother me at all.VibrationThere is a slight barely noticeable vibration under the right palm rest. This is caused by the faster 7200RPM HD. Not enough to bother me. It may irritate some people.Build QualityBrushed real metal aluminum lid and palm surface area. Solid machine no flex on the chassis. Screen has is slightly flexible but it's strong enough for everyday usage.  Some of the plastic components such as the keyboard molding have a slight give if you apply pressure with your finger, but honestly, for the price it very well built!KeyboardI wish it gave a little more feedback to the touch for my taste. But I can type fast and smoothly on it.Touchpad - NEEDS MANY IMPROVEMENTS!!!!!Gorgeous to look at, terrible material since it's a bit sticky to the touch. But after a while I became used to it. Doesn't bother me most of the time. If you are a heavy with your finger pressure, it may bother you. But if not, it may be ok. It easily smudges but I just wipe it once in a while with a tissue paper and voila good as new.  The software itself is flaky too. HP YOU NEED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS!! TOUCHPADS SHOULD BE EFFORTLESS. WHY DON'T YOU USE THE BRUSHED ALUMINUM MATERIAL ON THE TOUCHPAD AS WELL.Touchpad Button - NEEDS IMPROVEMENT!!!!!WAY TOO STIFF!!!!  Need to apply way too much pressure to click down. This is annoying sometimes.Video CameraSurprisingly good. Nowhere near the quality of my Logitech 9000.

I absolutely love its small form factor, fit, and finish. It serves my needs well, though I was hesitant to downsize from my old 15\" to this smaller machine. My favorite feature are the metallic surfaces, that give it an elegant yet rugged feel. I haven't missed the CD/DVD drive at all.I wish it were all good, but with any technological device, there are issues. The most prevalent is the touch pad. Ninety-five percent of the time it behaves flawlessly, but sometime for no reason it gets crazy, and it is impossible to navigate the cursor to where you want it. Restarting the computer seems to fix the issue. Also, the battery life is overstated.

Mc Farlane", "ReviewID": "R2M00Y1VYOMMS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop on the basis that it would give 5-6 hours of battery life with reasonable use as advertised. I was sorely disappointed with this advertised aspect of the machine since at best I was only able to squeeze 1 1/2- 2 hours (could be less) out of a full charge. This is with wi-fi and bluetooth off, running  a few saved videos on my hard drive. The machine's other features, like its beautiful finish, outstanding performance, and overall portability remain true to the ad, but if you are looking for a machine to give you a couple hours well between recharging, look elsewhere.Also it does tend to get uncomfortably warm when the processor is being taxed. The left palm rest in particular.Production values on the power button leave a lot to be desired. It feels loose and a bit too shaky like it could fall off easily. A reviewer on other site has noted this about the power button as well. If you buy the machine you would have to baby the power button because if it falls off, there is no other way to put the machine on.(ie no remote control powering up access that is standard with the larger pavilion entertainment pC's)On the plus side, the screen is beautiful and the chicklet style keys are easy to type on. The overall style of the laptop turns heads everywhere, just don't depend on the battery lasting long.Bottom line, its a beautiful zippy laptop and windows 7 is a plus.

I owned this notebook for a few days but ended up returning it.  I decided to get the ASUS UL30A instead, and I couldn't be happier with my decision because it addresses all the \"cons\" of the HP DM3-1030 while still excelling on all the \"pros\" I've listed below in more details . . .PROS:-Solid Keyboard Construction:  keys quite responsive with no flex.-Pleasing Design Aesthetics: beautiful brushed metal encasing, thin profile, modern LED indicator lights.-Battery: solid long, life.CONS:-Poor Trackpad Functionality (chief complaint): often requires several trackpad tap attempts before the system registers it as a mouse click; mirror-like finish is somewhat sticky and has a great deal of friction making movement a chore; trackpad buttons are extremely stiff and skinny making clicking extremely taxing.  For these reasons, dragging and dropping using the trackpad and buttons is quite cumbersome.-Impractical Keyboard Layout: I just couldn't get past HP's decision to require pressing the \"Fn\" key to activate commonly used keyboard buttons like Pg Up, Pg Down, Home, and End.  Another example is having to press  the \"Fn\" key to activate the F4 button.  So instead of just using the Ctrl-F4 keyboard shortcut to exit a program, you have to press Ctrl-Fn-F4.  And if you forget, you might accidentally put your computer to sleep because that's what the F4 button is used for on this keyboard.-Noisy Fan: when I first turned it on, I immediately noticed how loud the fan was . It never quiets down even if the computer is idle.  When you use memory intensive programs, it gets even louder, and the wrist rest gets really hot.", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very Poor Quality", "Author": "Tom \"Tom\"", "ReviewID": "R1822Z3DRQ56E7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this because the price, $549, was attractive at the time.  The hard drive failed within a year and a half.  The cooling fan now needs to be replaced.  Search the forums and you will learn the cooling fan really only lasts a few hundred hours.

Hardly used it!", "Author": "Midwest Man", "ReviewID": "R1AMQ0F9MI1ICB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great light weight portable laptop. I would not get it for a heavy use laptop, but is great for traveling and light use. The speed is fast and the screen is good, but the keyboard is smaller and it is harder to type on for a long period of time. However, the keys work great and do not stick. I use mine for traveling and it works great. It has all I need for traveling and I got it for $400 refurbished. My only complaint so far is that the battery went completely dead just over having it for a year and I used it on the battery only maybe a dozen times max. I tried to see if HP would cover it, but they say it is out of warranty after a year. However, I bought the extended 2 year warranty from the computer store, and I called them and while they say that extended warranty does not cover the battery. If I sat on it by accident they would cover the screen, but if by no fault of my own and hardly using the battery it goes dead it is not covered. That's a big let down. That isn't HP, but the warranty company, but it is very frustrating that HP doesn't use a higher quality battery. There is no reason the battery should have died after hardly ever using it. The software in Windows 7 said the battery was good, but the start up battery test says FAILED. When I took it in on the extended warranty to have it tested since they thought it may be a motherboard issue, they discovered that with a test battery it worked fine, so it is not the motherboard, but the battery. I could understand the battery not lasting a long time, but to be unable to hold any charge at all and being dead, that sounds like the battery shipped with this was just plain junk. I am disappointed that HP doesn't cover this or at least does not ship it with a good battery of higher quality. However, it works great other than this battery issue, and for $400 it's worth every penny.

I got this laptop so I can watch video's, listen to music, and go on the internet obviously it does all these things easily.With the way my homegroup is set up I can stream everything on my Desktop to my Laptop easily and enjoy a show or listen to music on my bed with ease and not using any harddrive space on my laptop (even though this isn't a problem). I can also add files to my laptop from my desktop with just a simple click and drag.I technically got this laptop in a day. I ordered from a company name BLINQ. The shipping was $13 but well worth it since it only took a day to get here and I got this laptop for super cheap.

(SD card etc etc). I find myself comparing this to a Macbook Air alot even though the Macbook air is indeed lighter but this has much more ports ALOT cheaper and the specs are almost the same (1.6 GHz processor/ 4 GB of RAM)I think my one complaint is that the battery doesn't last 6 hours on what I would consider \"normal use\". This includes music and internet streaming. I think if I'm listening to just music I may last a little over 4 hours heavy internet usage may last me 3 hours. I guess if I was just using it to type something in word then the battery may last for up to 6 hours but idk... if that's the case then dont shout such a high number better to say low and have people be impressed by the overall outcome then shout high and don't hit your mark (Assuming that made sense)", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worst touchpad EVER", "Author": "amethyst \"djardin\"", "ReviewID": "R134K1GB7RZYZB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Not only are the touchpad buttons stiff and difficult to use for long periods,  the touchpad FREEZES at random times, and there doesn't seem to be a way to get it to unfreeze.It is rumored that a BIOS update will fix the problem -- we'll see.Without this isssue, it would be a great laptop.
