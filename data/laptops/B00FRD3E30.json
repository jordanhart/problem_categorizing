Once I got the computer up and running the helper pop up with a message that the intel processors needed to be updated. Unfortunately, I pressed the button. After the undate,the computer would not reboot. Called HP, spent a few hours with them on the phone to eventually be told that I needed to reload the operating system or maybe just send the computer back. I sent a note to amazon that the computer may be returned which prompted the distributor Eluktronics Inc to call me and ask what was the problem (they called within 30 minutes of the e mail to amazon). They knew exactly what was wrong and I was up and running in 20 minutes. The problem was the update caused the computer to look for the operating system on the D drive rather than on the solid state C drive. I had to disconnect both normal drives so that the computer would be forced to look at the solid state C drive for the operating system. Also, you have to start and shutdown the computer twice. Once for the operating system and then again after you have reconnected the regular hard drives.Will at Eluktronics Inc was very knowledgeable and helpful. Without his help, the computer would have gone back to amazon.I would recommend skipping the update. I would guess that the problem only occurs with a three drive system and C a solid state drive (of course the solid state drive is why the computer starts and loads programs so fast). It was a pain to begin with, but I'm very happy with computer and the distributor once I got past the first big hurtle.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast boot and Great display.", "Author": "JP \"JP\"", "ReviewID": "R2QNBH743OS8S0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this a while and love it. It boots faster than any PC, tablet, cell phone, whatever. I've had no problems with it AT ALL. I've done all the HP and Windows updates to 8.1 without a hitch. The backlit keyboard and audio are great and the audio is better than most I've heard and great through heapdphones. I got my Wolfenstein: The New Order pre-ordered so we'll see how that runs and maybe I'll update some more. Otherwise, it's got a sweet display, audio, and boots fast fast fast! Runs as smooth as anything and I was a field support tech for years and built many of my own systems for myself and businesses and this one is really good. I had one question for their customer service and got plenty of prompt information that was very respectable and sincere.
