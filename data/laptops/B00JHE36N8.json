{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Highest Performance Laptop I could Ask For", "Author": "rabidreader \"rabidreader\"", "ReviewID": "R13SNYZAZ4VKPK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having this laptop a few days, I am ecstatic about it's performance. My work typically involves me opening anywhere up to like 30 tabs at once, and this doesn't impact the speed of processes at all. It may be a bit pricey for all tastes, but it is worth every dollar.The keyboard is also nice, responsive and well spaced between letters.Only thing that I'm not too pleased about is the responsive of the touchpad (which seems a tad sluggish). Sometimes I end up tapping 3 or 4 times for a click. But all in all, that won't keep me back from my work.Awesome, two thumbs up", "Date": "May 22, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00JHE36N8"}}
