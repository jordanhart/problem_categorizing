{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great price...with some tradeoffs", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RBWMP3IJRXIL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop is light weight, has a good keyboard for typing, has a built-in dedicated memory (2GB), LED back light display, lots of ports for input devices, WIFI, Bluetooth, DVD drive, Quad core processor, Easy to take off maintenance back cover (for cleaning case fans and motherboard and replacing RAM and hard drive) Quality stereo speakers (Dolby Advanced Audio). Overall, it is a very nice laptop. To be honest I was surprised it ran any games at ALL... Most of laptops at this price range sell with less features and lower quality hardware and you're lucky if you find one with a dedicated GPU. A laptop with these specs is a STEAL DEAL.I don't know where should I start...The laptop has a slow 5400 rpm hard drive, It only comes with 4GB of RAM and comes with windows 8 (windows 7 is better).The laptop comes with Lenovo bloat ware that just takes up hard drive space and uses RAM. Laptop often lags if you have multiple windows open and gets really HOT. The GPU is not fully utilized when running games. Even after disabling all unnecessary background apps and processes and changing all the possible settings I could find to \"Performance\" and using additional software to speed it up I was getting around 8-15 FPS when playing the game \"Alan Wake\" on best settings. Another important side note is that the resolution is not \"True HD\" because its 1366 x 768 instead of being 1920 x 1080. The screen has to be at a certain angle when you are watching movies because the colors will not show the same.I have already invested into aftermarket RAM (4GB x 2) for better performance and suggest you people do the same. This laptop needs a lot of \"tweaking\" if you want to get the optimal performance out of it. I would recommend installing Iobit \"Advanced System Care\" to keep your laptop in shape and disabling any unnecessary apps and startup programs that could hinder the performance of your laptop. In order to keep the Laptop cool buy a laptop cooler stand or put your laptop on a flat surface because the case fans that blow out the hot air out of the laptop are installed on the bottom of the laptop (not on the side like they should be). If the bottom portion of laptop does not get enough airflow the laptop WILL OVERHEAT. In addition, if you have money to spare I would recommend investing in an SSD drive for faster boot ups, better performance, and lower battery consumption.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "good solid work laptop for a great price", "Author": "Matt Hoeffner", "ReviewID": "R2S9DO1Z5WCGTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a simple light yet powerful laptop.  I purchased it with the idea of doing spreadsheet work as well as word processing and fooling around in the internet.  So far I've had no trouble with it and have been really imposed by the battery life (5 or 6 hours).  Display quality is good but not great but that's not why I bought it so I don't mind.  Overall it's just a really solid low priced laptop.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful laptop for the price", "Author": "Hyrule42", "ReviewID": "R2KBJIKNV55RHH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful laptop by Lenovo. It's very lightweight and thin but doesn't cheap out on performance. Any other laptops that I found with a quad core processor were A LOT heavier and thicker than this laptop. It's perfect if you have to be out and about going to school or the office with it often. However, I do recommend investing in a good bag/case for this laptop because it is so thin.The outside of the laptop is great. It has a texture to it that doesn't show every single fingerprint and it seems like it is thick enough to not be horribly fragile, but once again I recommend getting a nice bag to transport this in.The screen is amazing, right off the bat it is crisp and clear. I haven't played any movies or games on it yet but so far so good.They keyboard could be a smidgen better, I had a problem with the first one that I ordered from amazon. The left side of the keyboard was weak and made a popping sound if pressed. Amazon replaced it quickly and the second one does not have the popping problem at all. The keys are very quiet and the spaces between the keys are wonderful to have. Also, the number pad on this is great.The speakers are actually nice, they don't give you the deepest sound but they aren't tinny by any means. The speakers are clear and loud.The touch pad is good so far, large and has a great texture. However, you do have to change the sensitivity and scrolling options by going to the Lenovo website and downloading the application to change it. I wasn't a fan at first of the scrolling but once it was changed there were no problems. The two touch factor on the touch pad is awesome, I can zoom on the page very easily.One con so far is where you rest your hand while using the touch pad gets quite warm/hot, not a big deal but worth mentioning.Yes, Windows 8 is hard to get used to at first, but it's not completely horrible. Lenovo actually incorporates it in an acceptable manner on the start screen even though this laptop isn't a touchscreen.All in all, a fantastic laptop for the price. I could not find anything better for this price range. The only cons I've had so far are: the hand rest gets warm/hot, watch out for the keyboard being weak on the left hand side, and the touch pad takes a little getting used to/some modification is needed. Also, there is some \"bloatware\" that could be removed, but that's not a huge problem. If you are thinking about getting this laptop, I HIGHLY recommend it.I've only had this laptop for a day and I already love it, but I will report back with any future problems.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT.. but not Windows 8 !!!!", "Author": "V.

I noticed the battery drains in less than an hour. Really frustrated that this laptop doesn't last long without being plugged in.  The microphone in the laptop doesn't work when I plug in earphones.  For a laptop at this price it is very good at playing the games you want on the lowest settings at about 20 fps like battlefield 3 or GTA 4, but certainly wont run anything on ultra settings at 60 fps.  It runs league of legends  easily at 60ish fps on the lowest settings but 40ish fps at medium-high settings.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$479.99", "Features": "AMD A8-5550M 2.1 GHz Processor (4 MB Cache)\n4 GB DDR3 RAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen, ATI Radeon HD 8550G\nWindows 8, 5-hour battery life", "Name": "Lenovo G505s 15.6-Inch Laptop (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41iX1Pk8cNL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CRXZVC0"}}
