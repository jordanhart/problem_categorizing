She is now in college without a computer! Her computer broke on August 8th and was sent to repair center for repairs on August 10th.The problem is that BACKLIGHT WENT OUT ON THE SCREEN, so you cannot see anything on the screen. (Lol, the second time I called a supervisor actually told me it wasnt broke). Well unless I want to hold a flash light up to the screen... Its broke to me!Office Depot offered a in-store warranty, but I had never had a problem with a new computer like this and I know how those policies are overpriced. Besides, I only use Square Trade for insurance on electronics, but it does not kick in if the computer is still under manufacturers warranty.It is August 29th and still no computer.  I called customer service and they put me on hold, told me that the part was still on back order. How can a new computer in inventory, not have repair parts in stock? When I called last week and saw we were getting no where, I asked to speak to a supervisor and they told me that there was NO supervisor available. Right!  I was told that the part would be available on August 28th.  It is August 29th, I called and it is still on back order.  When I asked for a supervisor again, I was told again that the supervisor was not available.  I had to argue and fuss to finally get through to someone who read some crap to me about the timeline and how they were following policy.I explained to her that my daughter is NOW in college and without her brand new Pavilion DM4 2195 laptop computer. No computer.  Now they are telling me the part will be in this week and it should be received on September 7th.HP, I will NEVER buy another computer from you, maybe you need to stick to making good products like your printers and leave the computers to companies who know how to make a quality product and have ample parts in stock in the rare event that a new computer breaks.An Angry and Frustrated College Mom!", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2nd Generation i5-2430m Processor, 2.4G Hz;\n4G DDR3 SDRAM with maximum 8Gb Capability\n500Gb 5400RPM Hard Drive\n14-Inch Screen (1366 x 768), Intel HD Graphics 3000\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit; 3 USB 2.0, 1 Ethernet; 1 HDMI;\nItem Weight: 4.4 pounds", "Name": "HP dm4-2195us (14.0-inch Screen) Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31XinVPblML.jpg", "ProductID": "B007WI1PJS"}}
