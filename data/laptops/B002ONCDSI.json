{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One of the best in its category, but has its drawbacks", "Author": "Christopher D. Blanchette", "ReviewID": "RBJU80ODWVK8N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This notebook is very stylish and has solid manufacturing.  I think everyone knows that by now.  It is much more sturdy than the Acer 13.3\" laptop that I tried, although the HP is about 1 lb heavier.  At any rate, everything has its drawbacks, here are mine:1) Touchpad simply doesnt work with the multi-touch gestures enabled.  When you open the notebook from hibernating, the mouse freezes and requires a hard shutdown to resolve.  Disabling the multi-touch gestures gets rid of this problem.  Also, the trackpad is jumpy and inaccurate at times.  For the average user, this really is not a big deal.  I consider myself an above average computer geek and I really have been able to manage just fine with it.  I did have to disable the multi-touch gestures(which gets rid of two finger scrolling, zoom pinch, etc) because there is a driver issue that makes it not work right.  (there is no resolution for this yet).2) Battery Life.  Other users of the same notebook with the intel processors have been getting 7+ hours of battery life with 50% screen brightness and normal wifi usage.  The best I can get on my machine is 4-5 hours.  To me, this is unacceptable given the standard set by other computers.  I spent 45 minutes on the phone with HP discussing the problem, but they wouldnt send me a new battery, so I'm unsure if it is just my machine.  It very well could be something wrong with mine, but it couldnt be figured out.  Just something people should be aware of as a possibility if you buy this machine.3) No dedicated home, end, page up, and page down keys.  It's really not a HUGE deal but I kinda wish they had just shrunk the keyboard size a little to include these keys.All things considered, my complaints really arent that bad.  Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.  It's definitely a sexy notebook that is snappy during everyday use.  Screen is great, as is the chiclet-style keyboard(best in class in my opinion).", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Better than a stick in the eye", "Author": "D. McIver", "ReviewID": "R21O2JL7G07BDD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Quick review - purchased this laptop for a friend.  Wanted something fairly light but powerful -- this HP is a great blend of the 2 needs.  I looked at the AMD chip version in a retail store and got this one (faster and more RAM) for less... it is Amazon after all!I am (and more importantly, my friend) very pleased with the performance.  The screen height is short, so using this laptop to remote onto another machine (Remote Desktop or GotoMyPC) have presented him with some \"getting used to\" -- otherwise, it's peppy.Take special note on the specs -- this HDD is the faster model, which makes a big difference in performance.Overall - great buy!  If I was shopping for one for myself, I'd buy it if I wasn't a Mac fan :-)Cheers!", "Date": "March 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop For the Budget", "Author": "WhatDaHeLL", "ReviewID": "R1EH1M27UY3D22", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got mine last month from MS Store with 40% the MSRP bring it down to $488.70 after CA tax... Plus 3% from Bing Cashback. So it is around $465. This laptop works like a champ to me. Not really fast with the Intel Pentium SU4100 but for the 320G 7200RPM HD and 4GB DDR3 Ram, it is considered fast to me! Small, portable and fit my budget that's all that count. Haven't since any hang in moment or blue screen like other stated yet.

The freezing issue after putting it to sleep is highly annoying.  Additionally, it turns out after I spent hours on the phone with tech support and ended up having to perform a system recovery, that there is a known issue with the sound on the computer.  Music sounds like it's being played on a record player with a very worn needle and the same popping and crackling noises come through on Skype and video chat.  I'm sending it back in exchange for a new one, but I have no doubt that the second computer will have the same problems.  And mind you, I purchased the computer direct from HP with all the upgrades.  Stay away!", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very Balanced Little Package", "Author": "PsychDoc", "ReviewID": "R3DXQNET819855", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This really hits the new sweet spot for portable laptops. I think by now pretty much everyone's over the netbook craze. Yeah, great idea but at the end of the day they're way too small and they have almost no computing power with those wimpy Atom processors. yet most of us who travel don't want to lug around a 15\"-16\" brick. Along comes the 13.3\" form factor. Amd with it, HP almost hit a grand slam with this DM3. As many others have correctly said, the track pad is nothing short of awful and the mouse buttons are too stiff. That pretty much sums up the negatives of this otherwise wonderful machine. The display is gorgeous, it's fast as all get-up (I have the Su7300 processor and 7200 rpm hard drive), it has plenty of RAM (4 gigs), the speakers are more than acceptable for a small laptop, battery life is awesome and it's a classy looking unit clad in all metal.I'm one of those who remember when laptops cost upwards of $1500 for a bare bones machine that couldn't do half of what this one does. At it's price point, it's a steal. Highly recommended.But HP should be ashamed of it's horrid touchpad.

I've never had a problem with its touchpad after disabling it via mouse settings. There is an instructional video as to how to do it on youtube. It runs perfectly on windows 7 ultimate. This is definitely the best laptop of its kind as far as looks, performance, and portability. The only downside I find with it is how hard the touchpad buttons are but I can easily live with it given its very strong points. The Pentium version is definitely better than the AMD one in my opinion.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice Laptop, But could have been better", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R167EU6P45NHRO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I payed 433.76 for this baby at Office Depot, my first Laptop I saved for with my babysitting money, and 5 months later I'm still pretty happy with it.

Although it isn't going to break any speed records, Windows 7 functions well enough on it.  Definitely ample processing power for web browsing and document editing.  I've watched Netflix without any issues.[...]PROS:*Slim- this is noticeably thinner than my girlfriend's 14\" HP.  As a matter of fact, it's more compact all around, with very little empty real estate.*Design- the all metal body looks SHARP.  There isn't a huge glowing HP logo, or any kind of design on it.  Just smooth brushed metal with a small HP logo in the corner. Makes the laptop look very expensive.*Keyboard and Touchpad- Although I've read in a lot of the reviews that other buyers don't like the keyboard or touchpad, I think they're great.  Yes, the touchpad collects fingerprints.  Wipe them off.  The multi-touch is amazing, too.  I've been on several other laptops since I bought this and always catch myself getting frustrated when pinching or stretching my fingers over the keypad doesn't do anything.*Durable-  I don't know if I got lucky, but within a few weeks of buying it I dropped the laptop (while open) off the back of my couch.  It fell over 3' to the ground and just left a small crack in the plastic trim around the body.  I've also knocked it off my bed and chairs numerous times and it's held up.CONS:*No Internal Optical Drive-  this is isn't really that big a deal to me, as most information gets passed wirelessly on my home network or through email.  But if you're looking at burning CD's you'll need to carry an external drive everywhere, which defeats the purpose of having such a small laptop.*Battery Life- terrible.  I don't know where companies get battery life numbers from, because mine only lasts for about 4 hours before dying out.  You'll need to keep the power cord with you at all times.*Plastic Trim- With such an expensive looking body, it really bothers me that the rim of the body is plastic (the part that wraps around where the USB ports and memory card slots are), and the silver paint is already wearing off.  How much more would it have cost for HP to make that metal as well?Overall a good value PC.", "Date": "January 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "hp dm3t mouse pad and wireless", "Author": "CA", "ReviewID": "R3QHDSKDUA3TTE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bad1.
