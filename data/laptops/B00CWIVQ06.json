{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Powerful and Attractive Package in a Very Competitive Price Point", "Author": "Meengla", "ReviewID": "R1KFJ59WSMZ6H9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this from Amazon to take as gift to an overseas relative in Asia. I have spent a little time with this--totaling about 10-11 hours of use. I am liking this laptop so far: It is fast, very nice looking, and light-enough in weight to not tax your lap too much for 2-3 hours.But, somehow, I thought I was getting a 3 lbs ultrabook which would not have a DVD drive. This one does and it's heavier than 3 lbs but not too heavy.The keyboard is perhaps the least pleasing hardware: It seems a bit jumpy: The keys are a bit noisy to press and seem to make some spring like sound--not very overt but I have seen better keyboards in even cheaper laptops.Also, I have seen better trackpads than this one but this is adequate.The mouse clicks on the trackpad are also a bit noisy and harder than some other laptops I have owned/used.Windows 8 is no longer an acquired taste to me but this is my first non-touch Windows 8 device (I own an Acer Iconia W510) and I think I'd prefer this one to have touch screen--perhaps I am spoiled.I have played some 1080p and 720p videos and they played fine.But the price was 'right' and this can do a lot of very productive work. I am giving it 5 stars. You won't regret buying this as a laptop. My preference would be to get a 'convertible' tablet/laptop instead--perhaps something like Dell Venue 11 Pro or some other convertible running Windows 8 with at least Atom Baytrail or Core i3 or better.I may add to this Review later.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I am very satisfied with a high quality product with great features for less money,this is my second ASUS Laptop", "Author": "RW", "ReviewID": "R1Z0PXQNCYLP2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this laptop for the i5 processor and the awesome performance, it has all the bells and whistles like the top name laptops for a lot less money.

In reality, it's nothing more than a $600 paperweight. I bought this laptop to browse the web but this is exactly what I cannot do with it. It simply does not stay connected to the internet for more than half an hour at a time. Forget about streaming videos or having long Skype sessions. I live in the city, which means there are dozens of wi-fi networks around me even if my own doesn't work for some reason. Yet, every half hour it just stops working and informs me that there are no wireless networks available. I've spent hours upon hours on the phone with Asus tech support. I've restored this thing to factory settings, I've downloaded countless updates, and it is still, to this day, just a $600 paperweight. Worst $600 I've ever spent. Do not repeat my mistakes!UPDATE:  Last night Asus finally admitted that this laptop is a lemon. They now want me to send it back to their service center for repairs. Of course they are not providing secure packaging, just shipping labels. If something happens to it in transit and it arrives damaged, it will void the warranty. The agent I spoke to was supposed to immediately email me return instructions and shipping labels. Nothing in my inbox after 12 hours. Today is Friday and I was going to deal with this on my lunch break but with no instructions and labels I will have to wait till next week. Words can't describe how disappointed and angry I am. Terrible workmanship plus terrible customer service equals the worst buying experience I've had in a long time.

These 2 usual features make the typing VERY DIFFICULT without looking at the keys because 1) the key pad has no contour by being flat among the same distanced keys, compounded by the lack of a wider gap to separate the number keypad. Therefore the entire keyboard is just like a woman's private part that is without recession, that is, no landmark. Before the purchase, a CNET.com reviewer pointed out this unusualality which unfortunately I did not treat seriously. On balance, the PC is powerful and fast loaded with features that are only available with much more expensive units. For this, it is highly satisfied product.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice laptop", "Author": "tones", "ReviewID": "R2SAHAJS3TIM2S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this laptop is the freaking bomb its super fast and just so cool and slim and sleek and i dont mind windows 8 being on it", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$569.95", "Features": "Screen Size: 15.6\"\nScreen Resolution: 1366 x 768\nProcessor Type: Intel\nProcessor Model: i5-3337U\nProcessor Speed: 1.8GHz", "Name": "ASUS R510CA-RB51 15.6 Inch Laptop (1.8GHz Intel Core i5-3337U processor, 6GB RAM, 750GB Hard Drive, Windows 8)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51GSNVEJLXL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CWIVQ06"}}
