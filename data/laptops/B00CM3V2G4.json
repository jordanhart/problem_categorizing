{"Reviews": [{"Title": "9 months in, so far so good", "Author": "Joey Joe Joe Jr. Shabadoo", "ReviewID": "RQZ77XSQ1FT17", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "4 1/2 starsI bought this machine when my old laptop's power supply finally gave out and I found myself in immediate need of a new personal computer. I was initially interested in the Envy m4 for the good sized internal HDD, 2 USB 3.0 ports (a lot of the competitors at this price point only offered 1), and decent amount of base RAM (8GB, expandable to 16GB). The intel i7 core also ensured that this machine would have ample and versatile power to handle most of my needs. And while the integrated Intel HD4000 GPU is hardly top class, it has managed to exceed my expectations, which, at the time of purchase, were low.Regardless, I ask a lot of my machines. Sure, it needs to be able to browse the internet and be used to create documents, copy files, etc. - and it does all of that, and ultra-quickly no less - but it needs to be able to do more than that to meet my needs. I do a lot of CPU-intensive file conversions (source material optical discs to MKV, FLAC, etc.), sometimes from HD sources which include but aren't necessarily limited to 1080p video and multi-channel surround HD audio. This machine has done a fine job of both file conversion and maintaining file integrity.I also can't say enough about the speed increase on file transfers with USB 3.0. No, it's not 10x faster as they boast, but it is 2.5-3x faster. I move around a lot of huge files - files in the 5 - 35 GB range - and the speed improvement with USB 3.0 can't be denied, even with this PC's relatively slow 5400rpm internal HDD. Having the 2 USB3 slots is huge, particularly when copying from one external HDD to another. (it also has 1 USB 2.0 port, so you should be able to plug in mice and keyboard without feeling limited.)Beyond that, I was impressed that a machine not featuring a dedicated video card performed so well with recent PC games. I can run \"Diablo III: Reaper of Souls\" with no lag at high settings, as well as Burnout Paradise (which is a few years old but is an HD racing game that runs at 60fps), numerous other recent (read: last 5 years) PC games, and various console emulators - though on the latter, the GPU's limitations can be hit when playing the most GPU-intensive games that came out towards the end of the last generation (or maybe it was 2 generations ago now; wow I'm old) . Am I going to play Battlefield 4 on this? No, but the folks that will are going to want a top class desktop. My relatively modest gaming needs are totally satisfied with this machine.When I bought this last June, Windows 8 was still in its relative infancy, and I was very leery of making the switch. I even considered buying Win7 separately and re-installing at first. However, I've found my transition from WinXP to Win8 relatively painless, at least once I found out how to disable the ridiculous baked-in Metro UI that comes with Win8 through the use of 3rd party software (I used SkipMetroSuiteUI and am glad to never have to deal with it again). This is less a comment on HP and more on Microsoft: what sense does it make to use a Tablet UI on a desktop, especially one with no touchscreen? And Microsoft wonders why companies will never even consider going to Win8 as an enterprise solution. I have been hesitant to upgrade to Windows 8.1, and based on what I've read about driver incompatibility problems, I think I'll stick with what works for me, which after some customizing is a fair approximation of the classic desktop experience.The machine isn't heavy, and is fairly thin, although I guess that's relative. If you spent $2500 on an Airbook you'd probably disagree, but then you'd be an Apple person and not reading this review at all. It has a nice brushed aluminum finish, a backlit keyboard, tons of useful touch controls, and decent-sounding Beats Audio internal speakers. I tend to use my Sennheiser earphones instead, but I've heard much worse sound on a laptop. The unit manages to stay cool, even during periods of intensive processing. I find the touchpad, which has individual right and left buttons, to be comfortable, although I still use a mouse whenever possible.One other amazing feature, definitely worth noting and something designed and implemented by HP (so kudos to them) is a small hidden partition they've created in the HDD, which has a pre-loaded backup of the factory installed OS. Thank goodness for this little gem. I managed to pick up a very nasty virus during the first few weeks I owned the machine, and even after three days of scans/quarantines/rescans/registry cleanups/restores, I couldn't kill it (it basically disabled my virus protection and destroyed the program altogether - VERY nasty.) As a last resort as I planned to take the machine to a professional, in desperation I clicked the HP icon on the taskbar, and managed to perform a factory reset where the main HDD partition was wiped completely, and the OS and other HP factory software were re-installed literally at the touch of a button. The process took several hours to complete, but once finished it was like the machine was pulled out of the box brand new. This technology is absolutely awesome, and likely saved me a few hundred bucks. I don't know why every computer doesn't have this! Major plus, at least now I know if something like that ever happens again, I can click a button and not need to reload stuff manually with physical discs.If I had any gripes, it would be the somewhat washed out look of the display - it's not as vibrant as a high end monitor, but let's be realistic - this is a laptop. If you want a massive screen with great color output, you'd get yourself a desktop, or a laptop that costs 2x or 3x the price of this machine. If it really is bugging you, grab an HDMI cable and plug this into your HDTV. The other thing I've noticed is VERY occasional network drops, but it hasn't been a big issue. In 9 months, I can count on one hand how many times it dropped the connection and I would have to reboot the machine in order to reconnect. It's an issue, and I've seen other reviews which have been much more harsh on this point but I can live with it if it happens once every few months I guess.Overall for the price this has been a great little machine, it's done everything I've asked of it and then some and keeps on chugging along.
