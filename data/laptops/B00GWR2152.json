{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great So Far", "Author": "A. Schaffer", "ReviewID": "R1EAEZKFU8XD5C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Still getting used to it, which will take some time with the new Windows 8 structure. So far, it has been extremely fast and reliable. Some features I disabled, as they constantly got in the way, but that's just due to me not being used to the new OS. A mouse is a great investment because of personal preference. I was able to find this for $499 instead of the listed price on this page and it is a worth-while investment, so far.Edited. This new OS takes some time to get used to, but in all, it's really fast and helpful. I have been able to do what I need and more with this laptop. There are a few things that have upset me, but not too bad in all. The battery life is shorter than I expected, maybe it's because of how often I use it or something. Updates in the past have affected the system all-together; I had to factory reset due to a graphics card update that made the screen go black. Quick fix was to just downgrade to the previous graphics card update before the affected one. In all, this has been a fairly reliable laptop and has done what I've needed it to do.Hope this helps.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great deal", "Author": "Baha Theo", "ReviewID": "R2BO1PMV21UUMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Brand new, everything is just great. its size is good and it's pretty light.

I really love it. The processor is really fast, I have a really good amount of memory on here and the hard drive is really spacious. Windows 8 takes some getting used to but once you get used to it's really cool. I really love the finger print scanner too. The only thing that kind of really sucks is the battery life. It can last about 4 hours. It's not really so bad. I was just hoping the battery life would be a bit longer. For those of you that would consider this a deal breaker, consider getting an hp envy with a 4th generation intel processor. The battery life on those are insane. If battery life isn't an issue, then well I swear you'll love this laptop :)I seriously would recommend this to all my friends.This is really great if you're a student, doing business, or just want to play games.But overall, this is worth the buy. Just make sure to get virus protection, A 2 year warranty, and a case if you plan taking it out.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast Computer Made Cheaply", "Author": "Ashley Henaine", "ReviewID": "R3ODCR2K1KN6CN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This computer is fast, has plenty of storage, is thin, lightweight. But all this doesn't overcome the fact that IT IS BREAKING APART! I take very good care of my things. I have never had this problem with a laptop before. The problem area is really just the screen. The screen plate is coming off the hinges. Webcam is okay-it's never been amazing. The more and more I use my laptop the more broken it seems to be. When I lift the screen, it makes this awful cracking noise- even when I adjust the screen. It has come to the point that I can see some of the wiring on the inside. :/", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love my new lap top.", "Author": "Sandra McKenzie", "ReviewID": "R12YCWYCHHORDC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is an amazing lap top.

The keyboard isn't as sensitive as some, which I like but those with a soft touch may not. I've had several people be surprised at how lightweight it is. I rarely use the touchpad because I'm the kind of person that has to have a mouse but no complaints about the touchpad. Sound is good. I may be the only person who immediately adapted to Windows 8 with no problems. It's like getting a brand new phone, you just have to format it and adjust it to your liking. Being able to play around with apps and screens is fun to me. I got it on a really good Black Friday deal, not sure if I would have paid full price for it though.

Windows 8 is actually not bad at all, sure the start screen is a little weird and takes some time getting used to but it's practically idiot proof, it's not hard to navigate at all. There ARE buttons in the touch pad, they are just not sectioned off and obvious. at the bottom of the touch pad you CAN right and left click, it works perfectly normal. Actually the keyboard kind of reminds me of a mac book so I really like it.The computer is so much thinner than I thought it would be, it's great! It's also really fast and the display is actually fantastic. I bought this for about $630 including shipping and it was a really great deal in my opinion. The shipping was good too, it took a little longer than I wanted it to because I was excited to get it, but it was perfect when it got here, in the factory sealed box and everything.
