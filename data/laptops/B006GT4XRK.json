When I first purchased this laptop, I was really excited. That quickly changed the moment I unwrapped the laptop from the box. I'm not sure if this is true for all Gateway W322 models or if it's just because my laptop is old, but the laptop runs extremely slowly and freezes often. The removable battery comes off frequently, so I have to tape it down. I also have to push in the power cord constantly to keep it charged. I'd suggest purchasing another laptop.", "Date": "January 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "NULL", "Name": "Gateway W322 N520e Refurbished Laptop 2 Ghz 1 Gb Ram 60 Gb Hd with Bag", "ImgURL": "NULL", "ProductID": "B006GT4XRK"}}
