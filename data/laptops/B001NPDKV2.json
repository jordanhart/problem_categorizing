I was truely impressed with ease of setup, which took about 15 minutes from opening the box and connecting the battery.This is a rather large laptop and it is somewhat heavy, but not unreasonably so. Here are my observations:* Large 15.6\" screen is very sharp* Keyboard includes a numeric keypad* Good sized Hard Drive* DL DVD RW* Fast Processor (beats the heck out of my old ACER)* Lots of RAM (expandable to 4GB)* 3 USB ports* Built in Wi-Fi support* Built in Eathernet* Built in Modem (but why? :-)* Built in 5-1 Memory Card readerNote that this laptop does not have any card expansion slots! This isn't a problem for me, but might be an issue for those wanting to add Firewire or other non-included (like DV) support.The system scored a respectable 3.8 on the Windows performance scale, which is fairly good for a laptop.Overall, I am very pleased with Presario CQ60-210US! Highly Recommended!", "Date": "February 15, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop, good price", "Author": "Biotexts2", "ReviewID": "R2Q9DB13BKQJAU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a replacement laptop for a 2 yr old compaq and is a much better machine.  It is large for a laptop, has a great screen, and has given me no problems.  I loaded 2007 Office Suite on this.  It is a very fast machine.  Shipping from Amazon was quick and easy.  I later found the same machine at the same price at a local Staples but since Amazon did not charge for shipping I came out the same.  Look through the laptop literature carefully - there is reference to an extended accidental damage warranty that can be purchased online for slightly over $100 a year.  It is a good idea if the laptop is going to travel around or be used by a younger person.  You can make restore disks one time - it takes 3 DVDs or about 17 CDs.  Best to do this right away after purchase and store in a safe place.  If I had done that last time I might have been able to save my previous laptop.  It will take about an hour and well worth the trouble.", "Date": "March 22, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very Good machine...with just a different key board layout...", "Author": "Ketul A.

So thats much better than the Vista Home Basic.The only thing different with this machine is its key board layout. Since it has a saperate number key-pad, the keys for Pageup, Page Down, Arrow Keys, Insert, Delete etc are either small or on some other location. That takes some time to get used to.* Large 15.6\" screen is very sharp* Keyboard includes a numeric keypad* Good sized Hard Drive* DL DVD RW* Fast Processor* Lots of RAM (4GB)* 3 USB ports* Built in Wi-Fi support* Built in Eathernet* Built in Modem (in case you still live in old days :-)* Built in 5-1 Memory Card readerIt has a 15.6 inch screen and comes with direct DVD playback.

Yes, this laptop like all entry level laptops, was not really meant for gaming but lets face it, with today's technology, all entry level laptops can in fact play any game except for those out in the last year, when given enough of the associated resources.  Why does it not have the nvidia mobile video like its sister machines.2) advertising is suspect (putting it nicely); notice how the description says \"ready for tomorrow's 64-bit applications\" yet in typical stupidity, it is sold with the 32-bit version of Vista.  How are you supposed to run 64-bit apps like the add says, if you only have a 32-bit O/S?  You can't.3) only comes with 2gb of memory.  Hey, the max is four.  How much more can it really cost to add the extra 2GB?  Not much, memory is cheap today.  Having 4GB vs 2GB makes all the difference in running VISTA.  Vista is a nice snappy O/S, as long as you have enough memory.4) no hdmi out port.  I am OK with this I guess; not an issue if you are never hooking it to another monitor or tv.  It is after all an entry leve laptop.So in the end, another could have been.  Stick with the 212-us sister machine, it is the same machine (2.0GHz cpu) but has the 64-bit O/S and 4GB of memory and 8200m video.Hail Flavius", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop for the price", "Author": "L.

The monitor seems huge with great quality, it boots up fast and is speedy on processing.  The battery is short lived but that is par with a dual processor.  We use it mostly at home for basic email, web surfing & games.  A nice laptop, if you can search for deals and get a better price. Big deciding factor for us was the dual core processor.  Twice the machine for the same price as a Walmart Single core processor.  Be careful when comparing the 2!  Windows Vista is not so bad, I thought I would hate it, but within the first 5 minutes, I had forgotten it was any different from XP. So, don't weight your decision too much on that.

The only thing that took some getting used to was the keyboard is like a full 101 PC keyboard.  It has a full 10 key which shifts the QWERETY over a touch.I would recommend it and after owning it for 3 months, I would buy one again!

The built in speakers (Altec Lansing, located at top of keyboard near the screen) aren't great, but by laptop standards they are decent.The laptop's overall speed is pretty good, but the first thing I would do if invest another $60 and upgrade your RAM to the full 4GB.Keyboard isn't too loud.  The touchpad is nice and is built into the surrounding silver motif.  You also have a button to turn the touchpad on and off when you want which is nice.All of your ports are on the sides, as the rear of the laptop is made up of the hinge for the screen.  You get 3 USB, 1 Ethernet, 1 VGA, and a phone port.  There is no PCMIA, which is a bummer if you wanted to add a cellular wireless card, but we will live.The screen is bright, and built in HP software which is okay for beginners, is fairly easy to turn off and get out of the way.So considering the price, if you upgrade your RAM, I consider this a good machine for the price.", "Date": "March 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "HAD THIS OVER 4 YEARS - EXCELLENT", "Author": "Rebecca Lynn", "ReviewID": "R1J0SCPO2MNN1W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for over 4 years.

I wanted to leave this review in the event someone is purchasing a similar product or perhaps a used version of this laptop.  It has been excellent (even dropped a few times).  Only after the 5th or 6th time it's hit the floor from the table over the years did the screen actually crack.

Most laptops I've had in the past wore out and broke after only a year or two. A laptop we purchased alongside this model with the same specs crashed and broke after only a year and had to be replaced while the compaq kept strong. After two years the battery did die out on me and needed to be replaced but it was to be expected. And after four and half years the backlight on the screen died out but the computer, which is hooked to an external monitor until it can be fixed, still works wonderfully and just as new as it did five years ago. These types of breakdowns are to be expected but can be fixed without having to dish out for a whole new computer.So if you're looking for a computer worth its price and lasts this is the one you want.

My battery died (will not hold a charge) after about 6 months. I contacted support and they refused to replace the battery because I had installed Linux as my operating system.
