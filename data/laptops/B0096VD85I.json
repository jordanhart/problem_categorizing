{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Absolutely fantastic laptop and worth every penny.  Fast, stunning display and sound.", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R1LPM0Z936OEUY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Aside from an iPod I had purchased some years ago, this is my first Apple product.First a bit of a preamble:I have many years of professional and personal experience using a variety of computers and operating systems as a professional and a personal user.I had no intentions of buying this computer, but I was kinda \"forced\" into it. Here's why:I purchased the 13\" Macbook Pro with retina display for my wife (her old laptop with Windows XP was becoming a nightmare.  (I had to be on 24x7 call as in-house admin, to fix any number of daily problems).  But there was a rub. Safari uses black fonts on a dark gray background for the toolbar and tabs (I didn't notice this when I was in the store).  I expected that there would be a preference option to change the font, color and background.  Incredibly enough, there are no such options.  Apple support confirmed this.  I installed Firefox and while there's a free extension to change colors and font size, the results were fairly awful.  And, of course, Apple does not offer any support if you change to Firefox which is \"not their product.\"Then the 13\" MBP locked up.  It literally froze.  I couldn't even power down the computer.  I called Apple and they told me what sequence of keys I needed to press to restart the computer.After doing some research, I found that the computer freeze problem was common to the 13\" MBP (this problem has since been resolved).  With the computer freezing up, and my wife not being able to read that awful color combination, I returned the MBP.I set up an account for her on my $650 13\" Asus Windows 7 laptop (great Daily Deal) and she loves the light-weight computer with the large fonts and easy to read colors (this is after I altered a bunch of preferences).But now I'm without a laptop and I really don't like using my desktop computer anymore.I searched Amazon for a computer that had to have these 3 requirements:1.  Illuminated keyboard2.  SSD drive3.  8 GB RAMIncredibly enough, only 3 computers met my criteria.  One was Apple and the other two didn't have great reviews and were fairly expensive.So even though I have absolutely no particular loyalty or appreciation of the Apple company whatsoever, I decided to buy the 15\" MPB with Retina for myself.I'm in love.Computer heaven for the first time in decades.I was up and running within minutes and learned the basics in a few more days.  When installing Windows on other computers, I would have to spend a day to install tons of updates.  With Maverick, I simply turned the computer on and registered my computer (optional - not required like Roku).  I also enabled the tracking feature so if I misplaced the computer (or if it was stolen), I could find it.Unlike all of the other operating systems I've dealt with, the elegant level of software integration never ceases to amaze me.A few simple examples:* An appointment appears in my email and with a click I can add it to my calendar.* While reading a newspaper, I press Cmd-I and the article appears in an email (with the link to the article) and all I have to do is add the email address.* I want to send a person an image from the Internet using iMessage.  All I have to do is drag the image to iMessage, add text and I can send the message to the person's iPhone or Mac.Crazy simple.The retina display is astonishingly sharp and viewable from all angles.This would have been a godsend for my wife but Apple designed the Safari bookmark bar and tab in cool gray on black for those with perfect vision.What drives me crazy about other monitors is that the contrast and brightness changes at different angles.  I used to constantly have to change the monitor angle whenever I repositioned the laptop, hinging it back and forth.  No more fiddling with new Retina Mac. No matter what angle, viewing remains consistent.The sound on the 15\" MBP is much, much better than the 13\" version.  This is the first computer I've owned that doesn't require I use my Shure ear buds in order to hear good sound.The trackpad is wonderful -- I find that I'm not accidentally touching it while typing and I use a bunch of gestures.I'm already so spoiled that when using another computer I'm extremely annoyed by having to use something as primitive as a mouse.Dictation and speaking is surprising good.  I downloaded a voice file (free) from Apple that barely sounds robotic at all.If I come across a word (in any program) that I don't know the meaning of, using the keypad I press 3 fingers over the word and up comes the definition.  Press another key and I can hear the pronunciation (I learn better when I hear the word said aloud, and I don't want to sound like an jerk mispronouncing a new word).I adapted to the new keyboard very quickly and I make a lot less typing errors.  Normally, it takes me days or even weeks to become comfortable with a different keyboard.The computer wakes up instantly.  Not almost instantly, but truly instantly.  My 'instant on' Asus laptop takes at least 2 seconds.Unless I'm watching videos, I usually get over 10 hours on the battery -- even more when I'm reading a book with the wireless off, keyboard illumination turned off and the screen comfortably dim.  Typically, I only charge the battery just once at the end of the day.No fan!  No noise!  I believe that the MBP is using passive cooling.  There's a vent at the back of the hinge.If you're new to Macs, search 'David Cox tutorial macbook' for some great totally free professional quality video tutorials.Aside from the lack of color and font size flexibility for Safari, the only con that I can think of is that a pop-up doesn't appear when typing in passwords when the caps lock key has been pressed.  Also, I would have liked more USB ports.  I can't use my external DVD drive since it has 2 USB cables.The more I use the computer, the more I love it.After 2 weeks, I haven't felt even a teeny bit of buyer's remorse (this was a major financial expenditure for me).  I even bought the 3 year Apple Care warranty  (actually, it's 2 years since the first year is covered by the Apple warranty).Unfortunately, the warranty doesn't cover drops or accidents.  When I pulled out the power cord on my Asus laptop, the computer was very quickly repaired at no cost under the normal warranty.The computer and operating system is a work of art.Now I'm sorely tempted to buy an iPhone to synch my calendar and notes.  I was afraid of this - where does it end?", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolutely a piece of Art. Light years ahead.

I grew up on the PC, and I still use a PC with Windows everyday. However, after touching and using a Mac at the Apple Store in Scottsdale, I felt truly captivated with the machine and walked out with one-- the top of the line MacBook Pro.While I still use the familiar Windows Operating System, I am quickly learning and loving the ease, and effortless genius of the Mac OS.I see some people nit picking it apart. This technical detail isn't to their liking, etc. Speed, something something or other. Isn't good enough for them. There are always critics, but the truth is that the world could not ask for a more beautiful and elegant solution to computing. What would the world have been like without Apple, or more specifically, the genius of Steve Jobs?This purchase then even inspired me to read the Steve Jobs biography. My main question was: why does this machine, and all apple products, feel like they are light years ahead of everything else? Why does Apple feel like the only consumer electronics company that makes something not disposable; a piece of art and a solid beautiful object that does more than just complete a task. It is a joy and a pleasure to own, like one of my sport cars or a nice jacket. You feel it. You don't just use it to accomplish things like a PC. You have a connection with the MacBook. When you hold this beautiful computer in your hands, it almost makes you want to cry. Knowing that the genius responsible for Apple has passed away is a tragedy that mankind has yet to fully realize and appreciate.Needless to say, after years of stubbornly clinging to the PC, my eyes have been opened and I am a convert.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome computer", "Author": "Jeremy Fergason", "ReviewID": "R3NIRG6QIBCNXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a wonderful laptop.  It's thin and light but feels extremely solid.  The retina screen is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  The only down side to retina is that many websites don't have high enough resolution images so they end up looking a little blurry.  I just hope those sites increase their image resolutions because the retina display is truly amazing... it makes all my photos look a lot better :)The machine is very fast with most apps opening instantly.  Even heavy weight ones like XCode.  The battery life is very good; I haven't really gotten to test if it gets the advertised 9 hours though.The built in SD card reader is handy.  The only thing I miss is an ethernet connection (you can get a thunderbolt to ethernet adapter).  I rarely need it but there have been times.All the stuff I've come to love with Apple in a convenient package.  The free copy of Numbers, Pages and keynote are nice too.  I highly recommend.", "Date": "October 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Comparison to the Original Mid 2012 Model", "Author": "Wayne Ngo", "ReviewID": "R28O1SCRSFMF00", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some background:I own the original mid 2012 Model with 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD, and the GT 650M. Being an early adopter, there were some growing pains such as the stuttering of animations when swiping into mission control or scrolling on certain webpages. Apple has provided over the past year with software updates that have improved scrolling and animation performance. However, the real limit were in the graphics (HD 4000 and GT 650M). Now that the new model rocks the Intel Iris Pro and GT 750M graphics, we'll see how this compares.What I like:+ screen now covers 99% of sRGB.+ there is about an hour increase in the battery life due to the Intel Haswell architecture+ the SSDs are now PCIe based and therefore almost twice as fast as the previous generation.+ Thunderbolt 2 ports are present instead of Thunderbolt 1+ Upgraded to wireless AC+ The Intel Iris Pro performs nearly identical and in some cases better than the dedicated GT 650M under NON-GAMING work loads. A lot more information is available if you search online about Iris Pro vs GT 650M+ The Intel Iris Pro is significantly better than the Intel HD 4000 while having better energy efficiency than the dedicated GT 750M (thus the 1 hour increase in battery life)+ Scrolling and other animations are smoother than in the previous generation.+ Windows 7 and 8 run fine if you install via Boot Camp+ \"$200 price drop\" - see belowWhat I didn't like:- Apple changed the pricing scheme of the two 15 inch models. In order to get the dedicated GT 750M, you are forced to upgrade to the top model with 512GB SSD and 16GB RAM. Before this, you were able to get dedicated graphics on the entry model so the \"$200 price drop\" isn't really a great deal after all unless you can live with just the Iris Pro graphics.- This is unfair to those who are just looking for dedicated graphics in the entry model and are now forced to spend $600 more to get it.- Iris Pro graphics under-perform in games when compared to the old GT 650M.- You can't connect to Ethernet without paying $30 for an adapter.- Case scratches easily. I suggest you invest a cover and a well cushioned carrying case.- Many review sites label this as a \"workstation\" laptop but be warned! NEITHER Iris Pro or GT 750M are suitable for professional applications like Solid Works, Auto Cad, Maya, etc.Conclusion:-If you are into photography, video editing or want a decent gaming laptop then I'd recommend this model to you.-If you want dedicated graphics but can't stomach the high price, get the refurbished mid 2012 model - they are being sold at great, low prices.-If you are a professional looking to run applications like CAD along with video editing software, look elsewhere. Platforms better suited to your needs would be the Dell Precision, HP EliteBook W and, Thinkpad W series.", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "You do not need this computer.  Buy it anyway.", "Author": "Matt Turner", "ReviewID": "R23L6JVI3WD1GE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I confess. I could have spent $600 less on the \"base\" 15\" MacBook Pro and been happy 98% of the time, maybe adding a few hours of waiting to my life over the five years I expect to use this computer.  No, unless you do a lot of video editing or photo editing or music recording (I lightly dabble in the latter two) then you just don't need the premium graphics card and 16GB of RAM that differentiates this machine from its muscular baby brother.  But it certainly can't hurt.There is not question to me that this is a five-star product.  For anyone who would even consider Apple, this is simply the most powerful laptop you can get.  Unless you just can't stand Mac OSX, you will not be disappointed.  The display is extremely, unnecessarily crisp.  The keyboard is simple.  The sound is fantastic.  The trackpad is smooth, large, and super responsive. The screen bevels are small.  The computer is thin and light for a 15\" model.As for the internal hardware - it renders videos about 3x faster than my 2009 premium level MacBook Pro.  There is just no lag in general use - none whatsoever.  Boot time is nothing.  Of course, except for video rendering, you'd get the same experience on the cheaper model 15\" computer.The battery life is the one and only sticking point, but it's at the level of other premium power laptops.  I keep my screen on full bright, can't help it, and get something like 4.5 hours on a charge, sometimes a little more.  Unless you plan on doing professional-level video editing through the majority a transpacific flight, you're good.But like other Apple products, it's battery charges to 100% in about half the time of the competition.  This is a stat that doesn't get talked about enough, but that annoys me to no end about my premium Android phone that takes forever to charge.If you want a computer that is as future-proof as any on the market, with the absolute best processor available, storage to spare, and enough power to handle anything that might come in the near future, this is the computer for you.  If you can hold out a year for a fingerprint sensor, USB 3.0, and some other peripherals, do it.  But don't expect to need or get a faster computer anytime soon.That's why I bought this computer.  Not because I need it.  But because I might, and I know that even while this system ages and components slow, it has the extra juice to stay top-of-the line for years to come.  I keep my computers for half a decade on average.  I can't imagine that four years on I'll be disappointed by this one.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Macbook + Parallels + Windows 7 = Awesome!", "Author": "SMXSteve", "ReviewID": "RHEROSMORFDIF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update: I've had this for six months now and I have been very happy with it. I'm not a complete convert to Mac because I use applications like Windows Access, Word, Excel, Visual Studio, etc that I already had invested in. But I run them all on my Mac with Parallels. At my desk I hook it up to two ViewSonic LED monitors. Works great!-----------------------------I've been a windows user getting close to 30 years. And even as a Windows developer I have been looking for a change because Microsoft just could never create applications that ran flawlessly. So I started to think about Apple but what about all of those applications? Did you know that if you switch to Windows 8 you have the same problem?So I decided to give this Macbook a try and I found a program called Parallels which allows you to literally transfer Windows from your Windows computer to the Macbook! Exactly as you had it set up, too! So far the only problem I've had was Windows wouldn't recognize the network adapter but after some searching I found Windows was still trying to use hardware from the old computer. Removed that and now it works beautifully! I can literally swipe between OS X and Windows all on one computer!I use Office, Visual Studio, and a host of other Windows apps that in some cases can't be replaced. Yet I have the beauty of the Retina display and Lightroom 5 for Mac for my photo work and a host of other great Apple products.

But, I couldn't resist the $575 trade-in that Apple gave me on my old MacBook Pro 13\", which only had 4GB of RAM.As a software engineer, specializing in web applications, I need quite a bit more power and performance out of my development laptop. I have to make sure that my web applications will perform well on various operating systems and across all the major browsers. So, it is not uncommon for me to run three OSes at the same time. Currently, I run Mavericks, of course, and I also run Parallels, which allows me to have Linux CentOS and Windows 7 running concurrently. And, it does so without any sluggishness in performance.I run IntelliJ as my IDE (interactive development environment), configured for a max memory footprint of 4GB. Within one of my three concurrently running OSes, I often have an instance of Tomcat active, and possibly an FTP and/or SCP server to test code designed to upload/download files. All of that is in addition to the normal fare of Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and a variety of other tool/utility software.Whether you go with this machine, or another, it's important to not only have enough RAM, but the SSD is vital for eliminating wait times. This machine performs better than my work desktop, which has 64GB of RAM and a set of Raid 0 HD. In spite of the massive amount of RAM, I still experience performance bottle necking, which is due to the hard drives. The SSD makes all the difference in the world.Anyway, my purpose here is to basically say that, if this machine can handle what I cited above, and do so without any noticeable latency, I' pretty sure it'll handle most users' needs.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect; but with one Flaw...", "Author": "bareyb", "ReviewID": "RX3VE3588GP9O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "LOVE my new Macbook Pro Retina.

Its hard to find anything wrong with this computer when you talk about hardware or the way it runs its software built specifically just for a mac. Everything just runs so great for ex. iTunes, iPhoto, Adobe PS, messaging, email, safari, word programs, and surprisingly games. I could go on forever on how great this computer is. I know its a little pricey but thats what it cost for something so elegant and well crafted. People want to see a new design but why? It has worked flawlessly for Apple and its consumers why change now? I use to own tons of windows computers growing up. My first one was a 1000 dollar HP laptop when i was 16. It lasted 6-8 months and became a hassle and slow. I went through laptops and desktops even went as far as having a buddy of mine build me a pc and no matter what there always seemed to be something wrong with it. I finally bought my first MB in 2006 when i graduated college and it was worth it. My gf actually has my laptop from back in 2006 and it runs amazing. She hasn't even upgraded any parts in it other than the battery. It ran better than my buddies new laptop that he purchased ( actually went through three) in the time frame of 2006-2014. Mac now has my money and support because whatever they put out is just near perfection. This laptop is a fine example of that. The price is up there with other premium laptops and yes i do hate how this sweet computer doesn't have an Nvidia GTX card but the Nvidia GT card will do. It runs games just fine but it would just be nice to have something a little more future proof. Anyways buy this laptop and if you can buy the Nvidia model. Way better deal for an extra 600. Also check the apple refurbished stores as well pretty good prices. Amazon used warehouse has great deals as well no need to spend 2600 plus tax for a new one when you can get awesome apple care warranties and customer service at a local apple store or even online.

If you're running software that isn't optimized for this, everything looks horrible. Even when you are running retina-ready software, things just look big. Really crisp, but too big. By paying for this really high resolution then, you don't actually gain any screen real estate, just a boatload of crispness. To me this resolution presents an opportunity to display smaller text and have it still be nicely readable, i.e. to gain valuable screen space. As somebody who uses their computer pretty heavily for work and often has a lot of windows open, that's really what I wanted. Who would want otherwise? Some strange niche of people who have bad eyesight but complain about crisp font? You can adjust this under Settings->Displays and choose one of the 'Scaled' options, but then it displays a message the 'This setting may affect performance'. That's pretty annoying. To be fair though, when I am using this to review the photos I shot with my Canon 6D, the screen really does shine.One last negative: the battery life is nowhere near what Apple claims. I never have any video going or anything else that should be draining it. Usually just a web browser, excel, and a few other pieces of software I need for work. I get about 3-4 hours from a full charge. In the off chance that I do a video call, the life drops more. The windows machine I also use always beats its advertised 6 hours...On the plus side, the hardware is stunning. My old computer is a 13 inch and I think I ultimately like that size better because even though this one is thin, it's still a hefty machine to carry around. The construction is classic Apple and everything works well. The keyboard and trackpad are particularly amazing.If I were to do it again I would probably get the 13 inch version of this with a 256gb hard drive and 8gb of ram and save myself a thousand bucks. If you're on any sort of budget, even that may be a waste of money for similar reasons. Then the decision would be tough because you could get a macbook air, but the screen that comes with it is really weak compared to the Windows competition.In the end I think this computer is a good buy for 2 groups of people. 1 - the small minority of professionals who need this sort of hardware, which are mostly graphic designers, photographers, and videographers. 2 - people who value a $2500 computer as a status symbol.UPDATE 4/21/2014: Another thing I noticed recently while traveling is the power brick is big.
