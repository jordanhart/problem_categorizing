If you turn the laptop upside down so that the indicator lights (power LED etc) are facing away from you, on the upper right hand corner you will see a tiny hole.  If you stick a paperclip in the hole it will disconnect the battery power.  I hope this saves someone from the headache I had!", "Date": "January 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Battery is not serviceable, works great when running", "Author": "Bugle M Ranch", "ReviewID": "R1HRLDCL9KJEJI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We used this for 7 weeks, one day we closed it and walked down some stairs, went to open it and it never woke up.  Went to remove the battery and found there is no access door. Called Toshiba, must return to them for service.....Bad deal, you need access to the battery to completely remove the power.****Update 11-14-13*****Toshiba required that I pay for shipping to return it to their repair shop.  Not sure what they did, but they sent it back 5 days later, it was in a restored condition, meaning they erased everything on my harddrive and had to reload all my software.The same problem occured tonight.  The lid was closed with the PC still on, this puts it in hibernation.  But then it doesn't wake up.  sits there with a fully charged battery and 2 LED lights on in the front of the machine.  Called Service, oh gee golly, they are paying for the shipping this time, what a swell company.  After I spent hours downloading and reinstalling all my games and other software.****Update 3-28-14:  I did not send computer in a second time.  Computer works flawlessly now.  My son loves it.  Read the comments, appears there is a reset button, if not open the case with the 10 or so screws on the bottom and carefully disconnect the battery.  Then reconnect and re-assemble.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "good item for low price", "Author": "JUAN C.

I not a techy person but I wanted a laptop to be powerful enough I would not  be out dated quickly. I chose not to have touch screen, my smartphone & tablet are enough for me. The scroll pad is metal and is awkward.the window 8 is hard to get used to. I hate the way the page scroll on the right side clicks the windows 8 into action so quickly,  if you aren't concentrating on Windows 8 while paning up or down. It is very frustrating to say the least. I will probably download Windows 7 Pro. This should help stop the frustration. Toshiba make a good product. We had Hewlett-Packard laptops top of the line.  Mine was defective and  not repairable, and HP would not make good any refund or credit, so I was out a large sum of money. That is why I will never buy HP products ever again. Even though I like how easy-to-use they are. most of my electronics are Samsung, I gave Toshiba a try because I have had that brand before and it performed well.", "Date": "May 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Hardware, annoying features", "Author": "Asteriskx", "ReviewID": "RDVHXP0R2FYNR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This computer obviously has some great hardware under the lid, for a really good price. As a performance junkie, that's what drew me to it, and on that account, it works very well. It also has some great premium features. Unfortunately, it has enough annoying things that pop up that force me to downgrade it to 3 Stars. If they had an option for 3.5, I would give that.Pros:Speakers sound amazing. Far and away the best laptop speakers I've ever heardSuper quick bootup, and no lag-timeDisplay is great, visually the computer is fantastic, slim profile and sleek buildEverything works well, no errors yetGreat laptop battery lifeCons:Too many USB 3.0s that don't work with printers and flash drives (or at least only work intermittantly). I need two reliable connections (one to flash drive, one to printer) at all times for work, and the USB 3.0s don't cut it.Time keeps switching itself back one hour (unsure if Windows 8 bug or this laptop)Mousepad: it switches to the flyout menu all the time, regardless of whether I want to or not. Again, unsure if this is Windows 8 bug, or Toshiba.So it's a good-priced premium laptop with some annoying traits. It's good enough to where I don't regret the purchase at all, but it makes using the computer occasionally frustrating.", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DPLUFLA"}}
