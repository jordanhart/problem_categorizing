This thing is a beast, I dont know how it plays the games it does with the specs that are on it but Ive been playing League of Legends, black ops 2, dota2, starcraft, Final Fantasy 14 mmorpg, world of warcraft all on medium settings with 60 fps, this thing stays cool as can be, and the battery life while gaming straight through is three hours which is falsely advertised but highly expected from anyone who knows a thing about computers. If you are looking for something cheap and will play any current game on the market at medium settings this thing is for you, IT IS the cheapest gaming laptop on the market period! It also does all those boring things like surf web and school project junk ^^ without any stuttering, and can run multiple apps at a time with no lag.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Incredible Laptop! This laptop is what ASUS was for the tablet market when they released Nexus 7 with google!!!", "Author": "xplics", "ReviewID": "RVPTDW00AD4SZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am just so pleased with this ASUS laptop. I have now been playing and messing with the new laptop as well as the new to me Windows 8 which overall is not that bad once you get the hang of it. As for the laptop I did my studying before jumping in and buying a decent priced laptop. I decided to go with this laptop due to the price, specs, and having dealt with ASUS with my Nexus 7 which everyone knows was incredible for the price. I was shopping around for a few days before making my mind up on this laptop. I am very pleased with this purchase. I tried a few games already just to see how well the laptop can run the games right out the box, and I am pleased. Far Cry 3 runs great, as do a few other PC games I tried out. Just please keep in mind this laptop is not made for gaming so do not expect some of the newer games coming out to run on maximum settings. The speed of this little bad boy is incredible. The pc has yet to really heat up or make a noise this is after hours of use at a time. The laptop seems really well built. The keyboard is very responsive. Also I was very surprised at how great the screen looks for being only 720p, plus very please at how loud the speakers are for this very overall well put together laptop. The laptop also looks and feels great. I would not try it but I am sure it can take a fall or two. I paid 450 and I honestly if I had hands on prior I would not have mind paying a few hundred more, yes it is really that good. Anyways if your looking for a great laptop for a great price you have one here. Enjoy!", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good product for a great price.", "Author": "Big-E", "ReviewID": "R3MP0WLQWXJ45A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a good machine for a great price.  It has a fast processor, a ton of hard drive space, and a huge display.  It also comes with a free 1 year warranty which covers fixing or replacement of the machine even if you drop it or get it wet! The outside of the machine is made of some sort of slip proof material, instead of the shiny plastic that most laptops are made of.  It looks a little weird at first, but I think I kind of like the look of it now.  It's different.  The keyboard is huge and has a number pad, which is a huge step up from my last laptop.  The webcam isn't great, but will suffice for Skype chats.  One of the USB 3.0 ports has a more snug fit than the other for some reason.  I've tried using it more often than the other in order to possibly loosen it up a bit.  The port works fine though.  You just have to use a little more force when connecting or disconnecting a USB device.  Battery life could be better. It will get a little over 5 hours unplugged, but I only use it home so that doesn't really bother me.The only thing that I didn't like about this computer was the Windows 8 operating system.  It's very weird.  It's like Microsoft only wanted to half commit to an app based interface while trying to keep its original identity.  I felt like my computer had multiple personalities.  The interface is not intuitive at all, especially if you're upgrading straight from Windows XP like I did.  There is no start button.  You have to place the mouse arrow on specific parts of the screen in order to accomplish tasks, instead of just clicking on a button or icon.  Thank goodness Asus  included a \"tutor\" button to teach you how to use these different features.  The app interface portion looks unpolished and the app selection isn't great. However, after much use I have gotten used to Windows 8 and don't mind it so much anymore.  I might even like it a little.  If you don't like Windows 8 you can install Windows 7 on the computer instead.  There are youtube videos that show how to do this.My review isn't based on the Windows 8 operating system.  It's based on the overall quality of the product, taking cost into consideration.  Asus makes a quality product, and it shows.  At $450, this machine is a steal.  It could easily sell for $200-$300 dollars more.  My last laptop cost $100 more than this one, and it was a piece of crap.  I'll deal with the not so great battery life and lack luster camera and take the discount.  I don't think you can find a better laptop for under $500.UPDATE:I still stick with everything that I said above.  However, there is one more minor problem.  The speakers are pretty good quality for a budget laptop, but they're located on the bottom of the computer.  They face down into the table, or your lap if you actually use it that way, and the sound gets kind of muffled.  I don't usually use the speakers since I wirelessly transfer video to my Apple T.V., but I was out of town and the cabin didn't have Wi-Fi.  I tried watching a movie using the speakers and found out about the design flaw.  I just placed the laptop a little farther forward on the table so that the speakers hung slightly over the edge of the table.  The laptop is slightly back heavy so it was secure and I moved it around a bit to make sure there was no threat of it tipping.  It worked fine and the speakers provided ample volume.  Just wanted to make you aware.  It's still a great buy and I still love it.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, but very weak", "Author": "Chase", "ReviewID": "R2AC5QEOZ0F42G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop itself is a truly amazing product. I was fortunate enough to purchase this laptop whilst it was slightly cheaper, but even now the ASUS K55 is an incredible \"bang for your buck.\" There are absolutely no regrets towards purchasing this laptop. Unfortunately I have come across a small issue regarding the screen, and have no clue how it was conceived. This laptop has been under my care for at least two weeks, all the while furiously curb-stomping any task I have thrown at it, but for some reason the screen has started to fail on me. The top, roughly 1/6th, portion of the screen is completely incapable of anything other than emitting a funky grey or yellow color. I don't know if I had placed the laptop in my bag incorrectly as I was packing during the morning, or if some other nuance managed to take advantage of me. Also, even though I would LOVE to have this replaced, apparently it is not an applicable option.So with that, I will warn all possible customers to be as careful as possible with the screen. Other than that, this laptop is a magnificent product for whatever you may need it for. It is incredibly fast and responsive, and will dominate any task you throw at it. If I were able to get a replacement, and not have to settle for a refund, (or the screen itself didn't give out on me) this laptop would definitely have had received five stars.TL;DRPros:Fast and Responsive A8 quadcore processorVery suitable large hard driveHard drive is also double partitioned (C: & D:)Beautiful 720p graphicsBattery life is decentCons:The screen is either very weak, or mine was defectiveThe mouse pad takes a little getting used toOther:Windows 8 is confusing at first, but I don't see any of the 'major' issues others come up with.

Now it's here and I'm blown away with the quality of this laptop, especially for what was given with the price.Description:-Exterior:The exterior design of the laptop is all black with no gloss with a faint line texture to it that would make a zippy sound if you were to run your nail over it. This helps by making it easier to hold. It's not too pretty, but definitely not very ugly. It is around 6 pounds and is very portable. there is a disc drive for CDs on its right, a slot for SD cards underneath on the bottom left, a USB 2.0 output, 2 USB 3.0 outputs, an HDMI output, a VGA, an ethernet port, and outputs for headphone and microphone jacks. Cooling fan vents and speakers are located underneath the laptop.-Interior:A 15.6 inch LED HD screen capable of a little over 720p (it's not a touch screen). It has a keyboard where all the keys are spaced away from each other and depending on your opinion, this may be a nuisance if you prefer your keys closer together for what I guess, faster typing, but to each there own. There is a track pad at the bottom center which at first had a weird texture that goes away after a while. Left and right click buttons are united with the track pad as one thing, and this may get on the nerves at times as it feels so unnatural, but you do get used to it. The power button is on the top left corner of the keyboard and requires little force in pressing it. There is also a fairly decent webcam on top of the screen.Performance:It is best for professional and recreational use. Thanks to its 6 GB ram, it is capable of doing work and running multiple tabs without lag or slowdown. It's fast and start-up is very quick. It comes with Windows 8 and to be honest, I don't understand the hate it gets as it is a very good OS. It takes little effort into figuring it out and I got the gist of it within a few minutes. A tutorial is also provided for those who aren't as adventurous. There are plenty of apps and games for download and if you don't like the interface, there is a retro interface for you to use. Graphics wise, it is very good and although not a gaming laptop, it is capable of playing games. The laptop is silent and keeps cool. Sound quality wise, it is okay, but earbuds, headphones, and speakers are recommended since the quality is affected by the location of the laptop's speakers.Overall:Excellent for what was given and will satisfy my needs in college. I like the speed compared to my old laptop and I love the weight. I love the HDMI output which allows me to use it on my flatscreen TV with an HDMI cord. Windows 8 is an excellent operating system despite all the hate it gets. It is pretty powerful and for the price given, you can't really go any other way.Grade: A+", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "A good share of performance,style and innovation", "Author": "Kerwinn", "ReviewID": "R373N5KMYOTRY3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this laptop 2 weeks ago and basically decided to write a review to help prospective buyers to make their decision.Performance: This machine performs exceptionally well. Multimedia and even slight gaming would be fine. I tested Sims 3 and call of duty on this laptop and was actually suprised by the frame rates (please note this is not a gaming a machine) . It gets 5/5 for performance because i like the fact that it has 6GB of ram and an Amd quad core processor and a decent graphics processor. The screen is also bright and displays very well 1366x768 is the max resolution which is a little bit higher than 720p high definitionWhat i don`t like: This is especially for techies the bios to me is very limited in the sense that it tries to take away control from the user. I had to modify so many options just to enable it too boot into Usb. Also the audio is sub-par and the operating system feels over loaded which is why i reinstalled.Finally: If you are looking for an affordable laptop then my friends your search stops here.

I was fortunate enough not to get a defect which is some of the 1-star reviews here.It runs fast and the boot-up is super quick. I have steam installed with Half-Life, Skyrim, and The Sims 3 and they all run smoothly with no issue. So the laptop itself is good for a couple good games. If you're a gamer like me then you won't be disappointed..(NOTE: THESE GAMES ONLY RUN ON MEDIUM SETTINGS OR LOWER. I wouldn't recommend playing them on max settings)As for the negatives....- The speakers aren't really good, I would invest in some headphones or external speakers- The track pad is awful, invest in an external mouse- The webcam is OK. It's good for skype and other minor things but if you're planning on making videos or editing then you'll need to spend some more money on a different laptop. (If that's your purpose of getting a laptop)- It doesn't come with Office, only a trial which I consider to be part of the junk files they start you out with (Virus protection software included)Overall, it's a solid laptop and it's surprising that something so good is so cheap. I highly recommend this laptop.UPDATE!Bought this back in August, still works!Gaming wise:I have Sims 3, Half-Life 2(plus episodes), Skyrim, Sonic Generations, Sonic CD, Black Mesa, Plants vs Zombies, Resident Evil 5, Portal 2, Psychonauts, and Starcraft 2 installed and the Laptop plays them all at medium settings, no problem.

The LCD screen.While the LCD screen looks nice, you have to get it positioned perfectly. If your line of sight is slightly high or low it washes out.So, viewing angle isn't very good.

I wish that all new computers came with Windows 7 preloaded with a pay for option to \"Upgrade\" to the Windows 8 experience.If there is a Con to this laptop, ignoring the OS (have you figured out yet that I HATE Windows 8 yet?), it is the power connector at the laptop.

It runs really well and the fan barely makes noise at all.My only REAL complaint, and something that's been worrying me, is I'll hear the harddrive click incessantly on a regular basis.

The battery isn't the greatest but will last 4-5 hours if you use it lightly, it also charges very quickly too.The performance is better than expected, very solid. I have a few games on here, Skyrim, SupCom2, Evochron Mercenary, Planetary Annihilation, Diablo 2 and 3, Borderlands 2, etc. All games play better than expected! I have considered replacing the screen with a matte finish, but the vibrant and easy to read factor with this gloss screen is really good!This laptop has been put through it's paces and has held up very well! I've used it for school, work, home, kids, and it's great! Windows 8 isn't all that bad either. It's snappy and once you add Classic Start or a similar start menu, it's like a snappier WIndows 7. The sound output isn't bad, just set a flat EQ or turn EQ off and use Foobar's EQ for music. I use various ear buds and full size heapdhones with good success.Having the DVD drive has been useful one time, but it was oh so necessary at that time, so glad this had it!I am considering putting Ubuntu on this in the future after the warranty expires and school's over. I have a feeling this laptop will be kicking around and performing quite well still at that point!I also got a Logitech M325 mouse to use and it works great.

I got this laptop for some light to moderate gaming, on low and med settings with decent battery life. Well, I got much more than that. I am able with this laptop to play older titles like modern warfare 3 on highest settings above 60fps, and more high end games such as far cry 3 on medium. The battery life on this thing is amazing with 2-2 1/2 hrs while gaming and 5 hrs while browsing the Internet, that's very good for a laptop at this low of a price. Also you can upgrade the APU (CPU + GPU) on this laptop fairly easily to an a10. I do recommend you get a ssd for this laptop, as the hdd is painfully slow. I recommend the mushkin deluxe. Also what I love about this laptop is the air intake is indented, so you can put it on your lap without blocking the vent witch is a huge plus for me. I also love the texture of the laptop with the small bumps on it, much better than glossy. Way to go Asus! I also feel like i should mention its durability. I had it in a back pack and it fell out onto marble floor. It survived a 5+ ft fall without a scratch.Now onto the bad.With a laptop at this price I knew I would come across some problems along the way. The first problem I came across is the touchpad, u can't click and move the mouse at the same time very well, and you can't right and left click at the same time witch is a problem If you like touchpads for gaming. Also a very annoying feature from Asus is the smart gestures, because you would do one of the gestures mid game and it would minimize the game. A quick uninstall fixed the problem. The monitor on it also has ok viewing angles, and is glossy witch is a plus or minus depending on your opinion. Only has 1 HDD slot, kinda unfortunate if you're planning on going with a SSD and want to keep your old hard driveConclusion:I highly recommend this laptop to anybody, for everything other than gaming on the newest games on high settings. I would definitely get a SSD as it will unlock the full potential of this laptop. I would get 8gb of ram if your gaming, so you can do dual channeled ram. Windows 8 is bearable for me if you upgrade to windows 8.1 in the marketplace, then get start 8. It is a pain to install Linux with the uefi and secure boot, so if u plan on doing Linux just do a virtual machine. This is a amazing alternative to getting a Xbox one or ps4 because you can take it everywhere, and it is even cheaper than a console.

I got this one to replace an aging Dell that took a surge.The ASUS came with Windows 8.0 on it.  Although I understand operating systems, Win 8 is in a breed all by itself.  I can see why many people don't like it when they expect an interface similar to either their smart phones or prior Window versions.  What most people don't know is that there is a link on the ASUS Start Screen which will take you to the standard desktop interface.  Most new computers make you look for that link.  ASUS doesn't.  That's a really good thing because it says ASUS is in tune with what the using community really wants.Only complaint I have is that the reviews I read said it came with Microsoft Office.  Yes, it was on the computer only it wasn't free.  Microsoft wanted me to give them a bunch of money.  I didn't because I already had a license for an earlier version which I installed and which works quite well.  What ASUS did was place a 10-Day Evaluation product on the computer.  That's not the same as providing live product as part of the price.It also comes with a bunch of utilities including virus checkers and firewalls.  Very nice for the uninformed and provides some protection which users generally wouldn't know how to select the right software.  Another PLUS for ASUS.For the price, I wish there were more USB ports.  And, it's to bad there is one port on the right side of the case.  anything plugged into that port gets in the way of an external mouse, which I use.  I prefer a mouse over the finger pad.  However, if you have one of those Logitech Smart mice, you could plug the wireless USB thingy into the port on the right.  It's be small enough not to interfere with the mouse movements.The screen is nice and bright.  You do have the option of toning it down with the function key and one of the functions embedded with the top row function keys.

This is one of the best things I have ever bought in my life.Bad - You need to buy a mouse because the touch-pad literally SUCKS!

Had scratches around the screen, returned it, got the same one the next day in the mail via overnight. Worked great! I absolutely loved gaming on it. Borderlands 2 ran on low-mid settings, Killing Floor on max, Far Cry 3 on low, etc. Games were playable. Then school started. I started bringing my laptop to classes, taking notes, and started that some of the keys weren't registering. Popped a couple off and the rubber portions weren't aligned evenly. Additionally, the trackpad was defective and didn't register my touch half the time.So a couple days ago I got tired of it, and called Amazon. With their great customer service they sent me out another one, which I'm typing the review on right now, and am deciding to return as well.Building a gaming rig, Asus was pretty great with the parts I used. But with this laptop, quality was hit or miss. The second time I got this Asus, it was whisper quiet and ran well, I returned it because of the keys not registering and also because my network adapter kept resetting while in school (taking notes in Google Docs while that happens kills).Got this third one a couple days ago and the fan is much louder. It runs slower, considering all I installed on it was Chrome thus far, and restarted a few times on its own.Essentially this laptop looks fantastic and is from a very reputable brand. It looks great, but feels very flimsy. The keyboard sinks in the middle quite noticeably.The GPU runs games on mid-settings just about, and the laptop stays cool. On my second Asus the fan was quiet, on this third one of the same model, it's loud, and is much slower. I'm done dealing with duds.I went and ordered a Lenovo G505s right before writing this for $50 more with a better processor and graphics card.For those of you who've had no issues with this model, good for you! Enjoy it, really. You're very lucky.
