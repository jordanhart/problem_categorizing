After getting to know my way around an Apple I would recommend an Apple to anyone. I know they can be pricey but they are well worth it. The one I bought has some years on it but works like a champ. I have no problems and it is fast. I personal like mine better than the newer one because it is all white. That is something I was wanting and had to get an older modle in order to do so. Again, love my first Apple and highly recommend one to anyone.", "Date": "June 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002KSRZYY"}}
