{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop, but you pay a premium for Apple", "Author": "Jimmy", "ReviewID": "R3R1Y5KVADPG8Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the previous version of this Macbook Pro released June 8th on June 13th and have had more than a year of experience with my Macbook Pro as a student. I have also been working as an IT technician. The only difference between this revision and the previous Macbook Pro I have is the .16Ghz difference in processor speed, 90GB in hard drive space, ~2 hours in battery life, a somewhat improved graphics card, and 2GB of RAM (cost me $50 to upgrade, compared to Apple's proposed $100).POSITIVES:1. Aluminum body makes the Macbook feel good to the touch and makes it very durable. I only have one scratch on it and that happened in the first month I got it. Other than that one small scratch, there are no scratches and I never bothered with a Macbook cover or anything.2. Snow Leopard is a very nice operating system. Was a Windows XP user before, but it was a very easy transition.3. The trackpad is probably one of the best designed and most responsive on a notebook. (I work IT, so I've worked on Dells, Lenovos, Sonys, etc.) I hate the two finger tap to double-click, so I made clicking the bottom-right right click. Still, the trackpad does not compare to having to a actual mouse.4. Boot Camp Assistant allows you to partition your hard drive, so that you can have Windows AND Snow Leopard on your computer. I had Windows XP, but upgraded Boot Camp to Windows 7 Professional. When you install your Windows partition, make sure you use the drivers from your Snow Leopard disc and download the Boot Camp drivers from the Apple site.5. The ability to schedule an appointment at the Apple Store for the Genius Bar makes customer support probably a good thing for problems. My friend had his hard drive die on him and got a replacement hard drive the next day since he was still in warranty. Even if you are out of warranty, you can still go, but expect to pay for replacement parts. If it's the hard drive that died, just buy it yourself since they rip you off.6. Apple brags about how Macs doesn't have viruses. It's true, for now anyways. Macs still has vulnerabilities though if you're not careful. As Mac gains more market share, expect more viruses in the wild.7. The AC adapter is well designed as you can add an extension cable if you need it. However, expect it to get hot.8. Battery life is great on the Macbook Pro. It can last me all day if I run it on battery. I've only charged it ~95 times (according to Coconut Battery) as I run it on AC power often and battery life is 95%.NEGATIVES:1. The price is probably the worst part of getting a Macbook. For the prices you pay for each Macbook Pro model, you can get a computer with MUCH higher spec parts. An Intel Core 2 Duo just doesn't compare to the i3/i5/i7 quad core line of mobile processors. The i5s and the i7s that comes with only the higher end Macbook Pros aren't even actual quad cores as they virtualize cores. Also, the integrated graphics card doesn't just not compare to most discrete graphics cards that come with laptops at this price. For the $1100 I was gonna use to buy this year's Macbook revision, I decided to build my own computer. It has an i7 930 quad core processor overclocked to 3.61GHz, an ATI HD5770 graphics card, 640GB hard drive space, and 6 GB of ram.2. Heat can also be a problem. The top left of the keyboard area (CPU area) gets quite hot (~150 Fahrenheit, ~65 Celcius) with just one Youtube video running in Firefox. I've seen it go up to 180 Fahrenheit (~82 Celcius) when running many applications. When Boot Camp, the Macbook Pro gets quite hot since it doesn't control the fans as well. I've found spraying compressed air into the fan when you take off the bottom lid to clean dust really helps.3. Compared to Windows, the Mac doesn't have games. Even if they do, they mainly are ports from Windows and do not run as well. Game developers usually don't bother developing for both Mac and Windows at the same time. Starcraft 2, which was developed for both Windows and Mac at the same time, runs much better on the Windows Boot Camp partition than the Mac side. I can only run the Mac at 1280x800 on the lowest possible settings on the Mac side while I can run the Mac at 1280x800 on Medium settings using Windows 7.4. If you plan to do powerpoint presentations from your Macbook, you'll need a mini-Displayport to VGA or DVI cable from Apple. This retails for $29.5. The speakers aren't great, but what do you expect if it's under the keyboard?6. The fastest way to transfer files from an external hard drive is through the Firewire 800 port. Firewire 800 does just not compare to eSata, which most modern computers support and whose speeds make Firewire look sad. The only reason Firewire is included on the Mac is because Firewire was developed by Apple and they get money from it.", "Date": "August 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "Will never buy another PC again", "Author": "Clem", "ReviewID": "RSLLQMQCFTG55", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned and used several PCs (both desktop and laptop) over the years.  For my personal computers, I always went with Dell.  After a horrible customer service experience with them after my last purchase about a year ago (too lengthy to get into here), I vowed I would never buy another Dell again.  So, I thought, why not bite the bullet and try a Mac?  It was the smartest move I ever made.For years I shied away from a Mac because I have so much Windows software that I did not think it would run.  I didn't realize until recently that a Mac can run Windows software (more on that later).  Overall, the price difference was well worth it, but I guess your purchase ultimately depends on what your computer needs are.  Here is a brief synopsis of the pros:1) Design.  It's ultra-portable, very light weight, has a beautiful look and feel, screen and keyboard are amazing.  Whenever I have to \"transfer\" to my work laptop (a PC), I feel like I'm going from a new Mercedes to a 1976 Chevy Nova.2) Ease of actual use.  Let's face it, most of us our computer illiterate.  A Mac is very easy to set up, and get running.  The software included is called ILife and it allows you the ability to do many of the \"basic\" things you would want when you buy a computer (e-mail, store and sort photos, run I tunes, surf the web).  The learning curve, I think, is very minimal.  It's a bit different doing some of the basic things that you're so used to when you've used a PC every day for umpteen years, but you get the hang of it after a while.  The Apple web site has tons of very user friendly video tutorials that will guide you through all of the basic functions and programs.3) Teacher/Student Discount (if you buy from Apple).  Although this doesn't apply to everyone, make sure that you inquire about this if it pertains to you.  You may not even have to be a teacher, but only work at an educational institution.  A lot of companies give discounts to their employees with several retailers as perks, so it's worth doing your homework.  Since my wife is a teacher, we received a $100 discount of the retail price of the computer as well as a free printer and a free 8 gb Ipod Touch. (to be technical, they weren't free, but they give you a rebate for the entire price.  They even did the paperwork for me in the store before we left)4) Customer Service.  Now, to be honest, I didn't buy the \"Apple Care\" extended warranty, but I know several people that have, and they swear buy it.  Again, when things go wrong with your computer, it's incredibly frustrating to find someone to diagnose and fix it.5) Boot up and Shut down time.  I never realized how much I would enjoy this function.  It takes the computer about 30 seconds to power on, and about 10 seconds to shut down.  Some PCs that I've owned (after more and more software is installed) take about 15 minutes to completely start up and be ready to go.6) It will run Windows.  There are several ways to do this.  You can buy additional software so that you can run Windows and Leopard (the Mac OS) at the same time.  Because of the minimal boot up and shut down time, however, I decided it would be no problem to just reboot and use Windows separately when needed. For this, you don't need to purchase additional software to achieve.  A Mac comes with a utility called \"Boot Camp\" that allows you to partition a portion of your hard drive (you pick the size) and it will install Widows and allow you to run all your Windows software on that portion of your hard drive.  You will need to buy a retail copy of Windows (that's another $200), but I think it's well worth it.  To be honest, setting this up was a bit of a timely pain with a lot of minor issues, but the Apple site, again, has plenty of tutorials and support sites to walk you through the process.The main reason I decided to go with Windows was that I have a lot of old software (mainly a lot of games) that I wanted to use.  I'm also a big user of MS Office.  Now, to be fair, Apple sells a version of MS Office that is compatible with Mac, but I've heard too many negative things about it.  Through my company, I was able to get a retail version of Office 2010 for free, basically, so I chose to go this route.This leads me to my minor gripes about the machine:1) It does not come with a pre installed office program.  They sell a piece of software called \"IWork\" that functions as a basic word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation application.  It only costs $40-$50 when you buy it with a new Mac.  I decided to buy it, and now I regret it.  IWork will do the basic things that MS Office does (and it is supposedly compatible with your MS Office documents) which is probably good for most people.  If you use MS Office for anything slightly advanced, such as macros or pivot tables, you can forget it - IWork is worthless at that point.2) The only other gripe I have is the \"trackpad\" that is on the machine.  This, in many ways is superior to using a mouse, but I still haven't gotten used to it.  I miss my old point and click button.  Any program where you have to \"click and drag\" becomes a bit of an adventure.Kudos to Apple.  Give them a try.  You'll be pleasantly surprised, and as long as you can afford the extra $, you'll find it's well worth your investment.", "Date": "July 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Peace of mind, but at a price and not quite a Windows substitute?", "Author": "Gladius", "ReviewID": "RNW1SVERA7INO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this and an Asus 13.3 inch u30jc at the same time.  The Asus was $879.  I did keep the Apple and return the Asus as the Asus screen had a lot of glare for my tastes; occasionally videos looked too dark to enjoy on the Asus.  They are similar machines except that the Asus includes Optimus with 512mg of video memory and a discrete video card.  It also has an i3-350 vs. the Apple's 2.4 core duo.  The Apple is better built.The good:  The Apple is well built and has an excellent screen for a laptop.  Good battery life.  The genius bar is two miles away and bulletin boards with many Mac users are only a few clicks away.  Snow Leopard is relatively easy to learn and one has excellent customer service for 90 days.The problems: some software is not written for Mac or has a subpar version for Mac.  Think of games or playing chess online.Worse, the 2.4 core duo does not belong on a $1,199 machine.  Many $899 machines now have i5s this summer.  (Apple can't put a i5 on its low end pro model or even an i3 as it would then butt heads with the $1,799 15 inch macbookpro.)  These same machines also typically offer 500gig hard drives that run at 7,200.  Some have discrete graphics.  (Few have battery life to compare with that of this machine, but the aforementioned Asus u30jc with an i3 does.)  Customer service is good but only 90 days unless one springs for Apple Care, making the price even more unreasonable.I could deal with a premium price if the machine had a 3.06 core duo or a low level i3.  And a discrete graphics card with, say, 512mg of VRAM.Soon, someone is going to come up with a machine that has the build quality of the macbookpro and superb customer service.  The machine will then be over-priced and somewhat obsolete by all measures.Excellent machine but Apple need not be so greedy.BMW's are overpriced.  My 335i, which I lease, is not worth the price even though I used to track them.  It does, however, have 300hp.  The Apple is more akin to a 4 cylinder Accord.  Well built and popular, but only reasonably powered.", "Date": "July 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "The best 13.3 laptop you can buy.", "Author": "Jeffrey Flicek", "ReviewID": "R2KSCFTLW2LTLP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Like most great apple products, there's already hundreds of well written reviews covering everything from it's wonderful backlit keyboard, to the beautiful aluminum unibody.

I recommend it to anyone who's in the market for a new laptop.Pros: EverythingCons: No matte screen option from apple, but there are 3rd party solutions.moshi iVisor AG 13, Anti-Glare Screen Protector for Macbook 13\" UnibodyOther: The battery will last 10 hours if you don't use it, but average usage will still give you a very generous 6-8 hours, depending on what you're doing.Try it out in person at bestbuy if you have any doubts, but I can promise you won't regret buying this wonderful piece of engineering.One last thoughtInstalling windows 7 with boot camp is as simple as you could make it. Having the ability to run windows 7 along with OSX makes this computer extremely useful. I have my hard drive split 50/50 one partition for OSX and one for windows 7. While I love using OSX, there a many games that require windows to play. I have a few games installed on windows 7 to test out the NVIDIA 320m and was very surprised at how well it performed. I play Left 4 Dead 2 at the native resolution with medium to high settings and still get 40-60 frames per second. Needless to say, i'm impressed.This Macbook Pro is the first Apple product I've bought. Never owned an ipod or anything else made by Apple. In fact, for awhile I was what some would call an 'Apple hater,' but this computer has completely changed my perspective. And if this is the first Apple purchase for you, I'm convinced you'll feel the same way.-Jeff", "Date": "May 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "This little baby rocks!", "Author": "S. Kessler", "ReviewID": "R1WOJ2QLRBME2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say that I have spent the vast majority of my professional life working on PCs, mostly Dells.  I also bought Dell PCs for my home and have been through 3 or 4 at this point.  I've had Windows 95, Windows Millenium, and Windows XP.  Last year, when my last Dell appeared to outlive its usefulness at about 4 1/2 years, having slowed down to a crawl and almost coming to a stop thanks to McAfee antivirus protection, I decided it was time for my next computer.  So I started doing my typical exhaustive research.  At that time, Windows Vista had the market and I heard nothing but negative things about it.  At the same time, I'd noticed that one by one, most of my friends had switched to Mac.  So I finally decided to do that, too.  Bought an iMac 24\" and have never been a happier camper on the computer. Love, love, love it.This spring, anticipating some work travel coming up and also foot surgery in the summer that will keep me at home, mostly on the couch, for a good 12 weeks, I decided it was time for a portable something.  Friends showed me their Asus Netbooks, and I was intrigued.  Checked it out and thought I'd get one.  Even though they were Windows-based.  But I liked the long battery life.  Then I got enticed by the MacBook Air, but decided that as sexy and light at it is, it was too expensive for what you got and the battery life was awful.  Next I was looking at the Asus \"Thin and Light\" models, which looked like a good compromise.  Long battery life, lightweight, and several hundred dollars cheaper than the MacBook Pro 13\" which I also looked at.  What to do, what to do.  Well, after reading what seemed like hundreds of customer reviews not only for the computers but for Windows 7, I finally realized that I really and truly wanted the Mac.  The Windows users were grousing a lot.  The Mac users just loved their computers.  Getting my tax refund check in the mail the morning I was going to make a purchase clinched the deal. I bought the 13\" MacBook Pro.I received it this weekend, along with an Airport Express router, set it all up with little difficulty, and was happily -- very happily -- playing with my new MBP yesterday.  I couldn't be happier.  The computer is a joy to look at and work on.  The display is clear, sharp, and beautiful.  The keyboard is very comfortable, even typing on my lap.  I just adore the trackpad, even though I'm still getting used to all the finger movements.  It found the internet and my network printer in a snap.The only thing that didn't work well with copying files from my iMac with Migration Assistant.  I probably did something wrong and will have to call Apple Support to figure it out, but all my files got dumped into one directory that I have trouble finding.  I assumed the photos would go to iPhoto, the music to iTunes, and the Word docs to Word.  But noooooooo!  Hopefully, my friends at Apple Care will help me out -- they were wonderful when I was trying to set up my network printer.So I'm happy.  Very happy.  My husband's happy, too, since I won't be kicking him off the iMac that much anymore, and we can both play on the web at the same time.  There's nothing much to watch on TV anyway!Edit:  I noticed that the MacBook Pro is no longer available directly from Amazon and delivered free by Prime.  What happened?  This is just a scant week after I bought it.  Also, the printer I bought, the Canon PIXMA 560 is also no longer available through Prime, even though that's how I bought it less than a week ago.  What gives?Edit 2:  So, I see this is back to being available directly from Amazon and shipped free with Prime.  How weird!", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "First time Mac owner", "Author": "J. Blum", "ReviewID": "R1MO4UZRIXTFF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just wanted to start out by saying this is my first written review, but I feel that I have to comment on what a great machine this Macbook Pro is. As my title says this is the first Mac I have ever owned. I have used PCs my entire life and I can't believe how much better a Mac is. My last laptop I had was an HP and when I first used this new Macbook I couldn't believe what a difference there was just from doing the simplest of tasks. I can't believe how fast this Macbook starts up and shuts down. My HP laptop would take forever to start up and shut down which got pretty annoying at times. Even trying to do simple tasks the HP laptop would constantly freeze or lock up quite often.Another really annoying thing with my HP laptop was that it would always heat up pretty bad where my palm would rest below the keyboard after using it for a little while. I would then have to put it to sleep and wait for the laptop to cool down before using it again. I haven't had any heat issues with the Macbook and it's so nice not having to put it to sleep and wait for it to cool down. I've had this Macbook for about 2 weeks now and have had zero problems with it. I can't believe how smoothly it runs and how fast it is at doing everything. Since I have always used Windows switching from that interface to the Mac interface has been very different for me. However I'm getting the hang of it now and it's amazing how simple everything on the Mac interface is to use.I also wanted to comment on just what a great looking machine it is. I love the aluminum finish to it and I would definitely recommend paying a little more for the Macbook Pro over the white Macbook. The aluminum finish alone is worth the extra money. I also wanted to throw in for those who might be interested in doing a little gaming on the Macbook that it runs games pretty well. I recently downloaded the Starcraft II beta and I was able to run the game very good on medium settings without any slowdown. Overall I would highly recommend this Macbook Pro to anyone interested in getting a new Macbook or switching from a PC to Mac for the first time as I have. Now that I know how great Macs are I will never buy another PC again.", "Date": "May 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great computer- Here's what you need to know:", "Author": "MacinMD", "ReviewID": "R10DV7BMPV46AY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off- NEVER buy from Apple.com. You will never, ever get better deals than you can on Amazon or elsewhere online. First of all, know that Apple will most likely be issuing the next generation of Macbook Pros sometime in 2011- so if you don't need/ want a computer immediately, perhaps you should wait to see what they come up with.  That being said, I am not sure how they could really improve upon this device to be honest- besides a higher res display, speed boosts, and lighter design (and a scratch-resistant coating, but that's wishful thinking). Now, here are reasons why you should choose this particular Macbook Pro over the other Macbooks.The White Macbook, although cheaper, looks a bit cheaper as well. It scratches/ scuffs much easier than the aluminum and there are a few trade-offs in design.  With the white Macbook you get less ports (which I actually prefer to retain a simpler look), less speed (but not noticeable when performing everyday tasks like web browsing), no backlit keys, and the lack of a glass-covered display. In my opinion, the White macbook has a more attractive display as far as brightness, tint, and crisp images.  The Macbook Pro 13 does have a great display, just slightly less so than the Macbook's in my opinion.  The glass on the display does look amazing and is MUCH easier to wipe off lint, smudges, and \"spit spots\" from talking, without creating more smudges or streaks in the process.  Because of this, the Macbook Pro definitely has the better display all around.Do not get the 11'-inch Macbook Air.  Trust me, I bought it and it was nothing but problems.  I had to return it twice- the second time was because the bottom case made crunching noises and flexed while opening and pressing lightly with the hand. It felt very cheaply made to me.  Also, comparing it to this 13\" Macbook Pro is like comparing apples and oranges.  There is just so much more that you get for your money with this machine.  It will last you a long time.Also, in my opinion, 13\" is the perfect mobile size.  The 15 and 17 inch are pushing it as far as portability.The backlit keyboard is incredibly convenient for typing at night, but can be annoying because not only do the letters light up, but also the spaces framing each key. The Magsafe connector on this version of the Macbook Pro 13 looks beautiful, but is functionally horrible. Place it in one way and you have a blocked Ethernet port, place it the other way and the cord gets bent if your computer is charged by an outlet located to your left.  The older white Magsafe charger is better- if you can find one on Ebay, pick up the 60W Magsafe and you'll be all set.  I can see how the many ports of this Macbook Pro are convenient to some, but you will probably not use them all very often or at all. I LOVE the battery-check button by the ports.  Very convenient.  The slot-loading Superdrive is AWESOME, especially for you Windows PC people used to those crappy pull-out tray drives.  The computer is built like a tank and has an incredibly SOLID feel. The unibody construction is like no other.As far as performance, the 4GB is plenty, as is the generous base hard drive they give you.  Do not compare it to the specs of a Windows machine because the Mac OS Snow Leopard takes up less space than Windows and organizes, stores, and retrieves differently.  Hence, programs run plenty fast and storage is not a problem.For price- you can't beat Amazon when you factor in dependability.  You probably could find this computer somewhere else on the web cheaper- but if you receive a faulty product who do you think would be more apt to exchanging or giving you a refund? I have never had a single problem with Amazon's returns.  However, I have never returned or exchanged a computer with them so I am not 100% certain how it would be handled.As for the negatives:You will get small scratches on this machine that appear as slightly darker gray than the aluminum itself.  I do not recommend cases.  They make the computer hot, more bulky, put strain on the display's hinge, and look butt-ugly while destroying the integrity of the design.  This includes the clear Speck and Incase cases, which trap bits of dirt and dust and scratches your machine. You could always put an Invisible Shield on, but installation involves a liquid solution, makes the Macbook Pro glossy, and is a PAIN to apply.I have always found Apple's assembly quality control to be hit-and-miss. Over the years, through dozens of Macs, I would say only half came defect-free, if that.  The good thing is exchanges or repairs are usually a breeze.  This particular Macbook Pro 13\" that I bought from Amazon arrived defect-free except for a small spot of darker gray on the lid next to the Apple logo which is only visible at certain light.  I don't know what it is but it's definitely not worth a return.  With these Macbook Pros, inspect them as soon as you get them.  Look for these flaws that are fairly common with this model:  any scratches anywhere on the casing or screen, loose keys, a bottom case that makes noise if you touch or open it, a creaky hinge, a harddrive that makes any unusual loud noises while the computer is stationary, dead pixels in the display, backlight bleeding on the display (white light-leak from the LCD that you can test for by setting the color black as your desktop background or simply opening the Front Row application, which is mostly black).  Most likely you will not experience these things, but it's always good to know what to look out for before you notice one of these things AFTER your return/exchange period is up.You do get a full year of AppleCare with this product, as with all Apple devices.  This covers any hardware damage acquired through normal usage.  Apple is a company that always tries to make things right for the customer.Overall, I love this computer: Power, portability, features, and, as always, NO VIRUSES!!!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS 13\" MACBOOK PROI hope you all enjoy it!", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Nice upgrade from the Windows experience", "Author": "Metalrocker", "ReviewID": "R13AG43QFE8K1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After replacing many failed parts in my $2,500 Thinkpad T61 machine, I decided to try out a Mac for my notebook computing needs.

Finding a balance in these features was key for me, so my opinions may not match yours if these are not your priorities in a laptop._Portability_This was top of my list for a new laptop.  I have been using a 17 inch Dell Inspiron (1720) for the past three years, and have learned that I will not take it places because of its size.  Using a 17 inch laptop is great, lugging it around is not.  So when I started shopping for replacement laptops, I listed portability as my number one priority._Powerful_My #2 priority for a new laptop was that it was capable enough to multi-task effortlessly with the applications that I normally run on a laptop.  This isn't really asking much, since the apps I normally run are not cpu heavy.  I am normally running at least one web browser (Chrome) with ~10 tabs open, along with other apps like messenger/rss/mail.  This is fairly lightweight for normal use.  But I do want it to be capable enough to run image software, or video games occasionaly.  So while power was on my list of priorities, it was simply there so I didn't forget about it!_Battery Life_Battery life is something that my old monster laptop had a good amount of, but that's because the monster laptop had a monster 9 cell battery.  This increased the weight significantly, and made fitting it into bags even tougher (17 inch w/ 9cell battery growth on the back = snug).  I needed my new laptop to have good battery life without needing the extra weight/size of a bigger battery.  So the stock battery needed to be good.  I set my minimum expected battery life at 6 hours, knowing that in real world use it would generally not be that long._Less important, but still considered_Some things that were less important, but that I still kept in mind while shopping laptops.  Because I was shopping Apple & Windows laptops, I needed to make sure that the apps that I used most often were available in my final choice.  I also needed the laptop to boot quickly from sleep, since I was planning on having it with me for most of the day.  The keyboard needed to be comfortable to type on, or it would go the way of my netbook (doesn't get much use since it's keyboard is so compact.  And lastly, I wanted to get the most capable GPU that I could while maintaining the first three priorities (portability/power/battery)==Assembling the tripod==After getting my priorities nailed down, I started shopping around for laptops that fit my needs.  There were several units that I was considering.-HP Envy 13-Asus UL30-Asus U30-Lenovo U & Z series'All of these options fell short in at least one area that I valued.  The HP met the most of my needs, but it was too expensive and the extra battery options to give it super long battery life made it too heavy.  The Asus laptops were easily the biggest contenders, since they had great expected battery life, along with meeting most of my other requirements.  The Asus U30 was easily the option that met most of my needs, and when deciding between the MBP13 and the U30, it was almost a toss up.  I decided that the UL30 didn't really meet the GPU catagory with it's Geforce 210M chip.  The Lenovo books were also a good option, but I found myself wanting to wait for models that were announced but not released yet.  And I had also found people with Lenovo's had complained about their batteries not being up to par._Enter the Macbook Pro 13_Being a windows user for many years, I wasn't yet considering an Apple when I first started shopping notebooks.  Having experience on Mac computers through my work though, I did not discount them like many people do.  I have always considered Mac's to be overpriced, but very capable hardware.  The operating systems have only become competitive in the past few years with the introduction of 10.5.x.  My biggest gripe with past Mac OS offerings is that they assume too many of your decisions.  Options were often burried too deep in the OS, and you basically were funnelled into using the OS like Apple intended you to.  This obviously isn't always true, since there are Mac users that have a much deeper understanding of the OS capabilities than I do.The Macbook pro 13 met all of my criteria... but I only really started considering it when I found a deal that made it competitive with the other notebooks I was looking at.  Looking back now, I think I would still be happy with my decision even if I had paid the non-sale price.-Size/weight: I had the compact size that I wanted, and it was under 5 lbs so it was very portable.-Power: The 2.4ghz C2D is PLENTY powerful for every day usage.  I had no reason to upgrade to anything higher.-Battery Life: The battery on this thing is a champion.  How Apple gets this much battery life out of the same exact hardware that other manufacturers use is beyond me.  There is really no reason that I can find that gives this notebook such better battery life.  Now, I'm never getting the predicted 10 hours of battery life, but that's because I'm running several apps + wifi at all times.  I could easily get two full days of light usage out of the battery though, without a doubt.-Freeware options: I normally gravitate to freeware apps whenever I can to save some $$, and I haven't found any yet that I use normally on Windows machines that isn't available in some form on Mac.  This usually means learning a new app, since some apps aren't ported to either platform, but there are similar apps for both platforms still.-Fast boot from sleep: From sleep, the MBP13 wakes up nearly instantly.  Having used sleep on Windows boxes in the past (even Win7), I feel like this wouldn't be the case if I was using a Windows only laptop.  I had toyed with maybe trading the stock 5400rpm drive out for an SSD OS drive, but after my first week of use... I have no need for this.-Comfortable keyboard: The spacing on the chiclet keys is very good.  I can type comfortably for several hours, with very few mistakes due to misplaced keystrokes.  I wouldn't go as far as saying that it's a perfect keyboard, but its very good.-Capable GPU: I can't say I've done much to push the GPU to it's limits.  I have installed my go-to laptop game, World of Warcraft, and it's capable of running perfectly with the graphics set to Ultra.  Obviously this isn't the most graphic intensive game, but it's really all I'll play on a laptop anyway.  Most other games that I'll install on a laptop will be popcap games :).===Favorite Features so far===Having only had my 2010 Macbook Pro 13 for about a week, these are some of my favorite features so far._Touchpad Gestures_Honestly... how have I been using a laptop without these features for so long?  The gestures are my single favorite feature of the Macbook Pro.  After about an hour of getting used to using the gestures... I'm not a gesture pro!  They are very simple to learn, and easier to use.  Navagating on my laptop without a hardware mouse used to mean using the back and forward buttons on the browser, or sometimes using the backspace key if I was flipping through sites.  Using the back and forward gestures for web browsing is awesome.  Even after buying a Magic mouse to use with this MBP, I went back to just using the trackpad because its so much easier.  I'm returning the Magic mouse because it's less comfortable to use than just using the trackpad.Right-click is something else I was worried about when switching to a Mac laptop.  I knew you could enable the secondary click for the bottom right of the trackpad, but now that I've gotten used to the two finger tap on the trackpad, I never actually click the trackpad for right click.Expose via trackpad gesture another thing that I think is easier on the trackpad than the magic mouse.  With the mouse I had to set a hot corner to use expose to see all the windows I had open, but with the trackpad it's a simple gesture._Unibody Design_I'm listing this as one of my favorite things with the laptop simply because of how awesome it looks.  I'm usually not one for picking form over function, but I consider this to be equal on both of those fronts.  The unibody constructions gives a solid feel, without sacraficing weight, and remaining sturdy.  The fact that it looks awesome is merely a cool bonus.===Conclusion===So after spending several weeks coming up with my priorities, and shopping around at different options, I'm very happy with my choice at this point.  I'm only a week into my new 2010 Macbook Pro 13, but I have no regrets yet.  I haven't gone the bootcamp route yet, because I am forcing myself to fully learn and become comfortable with Mac OS X.  I will be putting bootcamp w/ a copy of Win7 pro on the MBP before too long though so that I can have the option of Windows available.  This was one of the reasons I ended up going with a Mac, so that I could run OS X along with Windows 7 on a single machine.  In my field, it pays to be familiar with both operating systems.So in the end, I'd say if your priorities align with mine, I would highly suggest considering a Macbook Pro 13.  It's not the choice for everyone, but it was the right choice for me.", "Date": "June 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great computer, but beware Amazon's flimsy packaging", "Author": "718tech", "ReviewID": "R3MA42DPI2J7S7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The 13\" Macbook Pro is a great computer, So great that less than a month after I bought one for myself, I bought another for my wife.

Now that I have some money to afford nice things I don't mind paying for them so I decided to check this out at an Apple store and was blown away. The trackpad really won me over.

About four months ago my company gave me a 13\" MacBookPro to replace a one year old Dell Latitude. I always thought the Mac fanatics were just that, fanatics that oversold the merits of the Apple units and I'm here to say how wrong I was. It only took a single day of multitasking, using Office Word, Excel, surfing on Firefox while ripping CD's into iTunes - all unplugged and I suddenly realized that I'd been working for over 5 hours without having to plug in to recharge. That in itself is amazing.The housing is a durable single piece of aluminum and it's so thin and light and this is important - it runs so cool that you can actually just sit it on your lap and work for long periods without any discomfort.The keyboard is another stellar piece of design. My sons always said their Macs had superior keyboards but until I used this one for an extended period of time I didn't believe them - I do now. The one major difference in the keyboard design is that most other laptops have a large single pad underneath the keys you see and so the key itself is depressing into a large single piece. The Mac has individual pads under each key. Why does that make a difference? I can't explain the technical reasons but I can attest to the fact that it makes the keyboard extremely responsive, quite and comfortable.Additionally, the back-lighting of the keyboard makes working in low light a breeze.But the touch pad is one of the biggest pluses IMHO. Trust me - if you use one of these for about three to four days and then use a Windows based unit, you'll find yourself trying to maneuver the screen using gestures that do nothing. N=By that I mean the fact that on the Mac you can scroll pages with inertia using a two finger swipe is amazing. It's one of those things - like a Springsteen concert - that has to be seen in person to truly see the advantages of this.Once you've used that feature, you'll find it nearly impossible to go back to the standard, grab the little scroll arrow with the cursor and advance method. The inertia feature is almost like flipping the pages of a book - like you want to skim quickly and the Mac senses how much force you've slid those two fingers and factors that into how far the page scrolls.Additionally, if you use three fingers and slide them left, you perform the same function as hitting the back page arrow. If you place two fingers on the pad and simply spread them - the screen zooms - do the opposite and it shrinks. And you can program the four corners of the screen to whatever display option you desire.For instance, if I move my cursor to the lower right corner, all currently open windows are displayed so you can effortlessly switch between them or if you move the cursor to the bottom left, the desktop is displayed.The bottom line is that this laptop is by far the most elegantly designed, flawlessly manufactured and reliable machine I've ever used.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Amazing!", "Author": "J.

I purchased it from Best Buy because of their 18month no interest promotion.  I would have purchased from the Apple store but they only had 12 months no interest, (lost out on 100dls and the free ipod touch for students but meh, figured i would pay more in financing).  I have had windows based computers since the first computer I owned.  My last was an el cheapo Gateway Vista computer.  Computer would lock up regularly, freeze, battery life sucked.  I could get about two hours out of it and that was it.  This MacBook Pro lasts the whole day without a charge!!!!! Usually with wi-fi use and screen brightness turned down to the lowest, and the keyboard backlight off since im in a lighted environment.The \"Pro\" is extremely user oriented, from the sensors, to the long battery life, to the multi-gesture that im just getting used to.  Usually when plugged in i have it on the medium to lower setting.  The screen and trackpad are made of glass, they scream high quality.  The aluminum uni-body casing is impecable!! Speaking of the screen, the brightest setting i never really have to use because it is so bright! Everything on screen looks crisp and clear and the colors this screen gives are wonderful. It feels so solid and there aren't any noticeable tolerances. It feels extremely solid.  With the awesome aluminum body, no fingerprints and if you get a smudge you just wipe it off.The software it comes with is pretty basic but running a web browser like Chrome or Firefox feels just awesome! No hang ups or slowdowns.  I have opened every program and used the browsers and there hasn't been any slow down or lag!!!This computer was well above my price range and if i hadn't been approved for Best Buy credit probably would not have purchased it.

Went on recommendations and chose the Pro, and returned the Acer.  I am glad I did.  Its like comparing a Kia to a Mercedes or Lexus.

From the first iBooks I get about 5 hours under normal use and 2 hours under heavy use (full out CPU plus spinning optical drive). That blows away the PC competition where I'm lucky to get 2 hours under the best of conditions. As I use my laptop on train commutes and flights this battery time is important to me.Since 2003 they have delivered on their near 6 hour promise as I usually get around 5. That's well adequate for a train commute (unless you are really unlucky) or a flight across the US. But now with this enhancement, dropping the CPU to 2.4 GHz and improving the battery I couldn't resist trying the latest model with the 10 hour claim. And Apple did it. When I untether I get about a 9 1/2 to 10 1/2 hour life with normal use or 3-4 hours under heavy use. That's outstanding. I can use my Pro for about as long as an iPad.Another thing that impresses me about the latest Pro 13 inch models is they dissipate heat well. They do get hot, being smallish laptops, but feel less hot than my polycarb 13. I am guessing that is because the aluminum unibody conducts heat better than plastic. I find the polycarb actually uncomfortable after a few minutes (and buffer the heat with a pillow) but can use the Pro on my lap for hours.The computer is a joy to use. It continues to have all the plusses of OS X and Apple's fine aesthetics. As the product has been reviewed so well for all around use I just wanted to give it 5 stars for my positive experience of no complaints. I use these laptops for my livelihood and they are running for ten to sixteen hours every day with no glitches. Plus Apple's agenda to give an outstanding battery life to the latest generation is a total success in my opinion.NOTE: As a followup I have bought three of these computers this year and returned one because of quality issues. From my (and others') experience with Apple I think my problem was just bad luck, but worth mentioning. So this year I bought two flawless MacBook Pro 13's and one that had the following issues. First I noticed excessive \"head parking\". I know the Pro's have an aggressive head parking algorithm and you often hear the loud click. But one day I had mine totally stationary on my desk in clamshell mode (mounted in an arc) and it just kept clicking away. The OS seemed fine otherwise and it just happened one day. After that I noticed an odd click now and then in clamshell mode. Second, and what got me to return this machine, is that within two weeks the \"K\"-key got stuck. It still worked, but was tweaked enough that my moderately good typing was no longer possible. So, as I was still within Amazon's return period, I returned the machine. That said I have two other MacBook Pro 13's this year and I have been totally satisfied with them.

She and my daughter use it for school (grad school for her, high school for the daughter), and both have become very dependent on it.  I bought it because she just had to have one (she's a teacher) and I wanted something ultra-reliable for her to use (I spend too much time in my IT job fixing Windows PCs, primarily problems due to viruses, hard drive crashes, etc.).  I just wanted to spend the extra bucks and not have to worry with her system.  Up till a week ago, everything was great and I was very happy with my purchase, albeit a bit poorer because of it.The power supply that currently comes with the both the standard Macbook and the 13\" Macbook Pro is the 60w L-connector model, and mine failed this week (right before Thanksgiving), November, 2010.  I went back to the major electronics chain store where I bought it, since it was less than than four months old, and was told that since I did not buy an extended warranty, it was not covered under the regular warranty by Apple (nor is the battery, but that is true for all laptop manufacturers) and my only choice was to buy a replacement power supply for $80. WTF?????Based on my reading of numerous reviews here and elsewhere, and previously noting the excessive warmth of the defective unit on my MBP, I believe the 60W L-connector supply is either a) defective in materials and/or design, or b) severely underpowered for the application.  I had acquired from a friend an old 85W Macbook Pro power supply with the T-connector that had a bad cord (another defective Apple design, also, but this was a poor mechanical design of the strain relief on the cord).  I was able to crack it open and repair the frayed cord, so that I could have something to charge the battery while I wait for a replacement supply to arrive by mail (I am NOT paying $80 for a replacement in a retail store). This older 85W unit does not run hot at all when charging or in operation, and works great with the laptop.  I would recommend to anyone buying a replacement power supply to avoid the P.O.S. 60W L-connector model, or better yet, avoid a 60W power supply altogether as being underpowered and inadequate, and buy an 85W supply instead. The replacement I ordered is an 85W T-connector model.One other issue noted by other reviewers is a problem with the newer L-connector vs the older T-connector.  Although the L-connector cord does not stick out as far from the side of the laptop as the T-connector cord, if you flip it over so that the cord runs alongside the laptop, the cord covers and blocks access to several of the ports on the side of the laptop; not so with the older T-connector.  The whole point of the original MagSafe design was that you could just plug it it without being too particular about it, since it works regardless of the orientation of the plug.  Some of the convenience of the MagSafe design is now negated with the L-connector.Looks like Apple has dropped the ball on this one, spec'ing an undersized supply or going with a low-budget crappy Chinese manufacturer, and based on the number of complaints I've seen in these reviews, I believe they are pushing a defective product, since this has been known for more than a year and yet they are still selling them.  Most Windows-based PC manufacturers warrant their power supplies for a year, and since Apple does not (or has stopped doing so), I would guess they are very aware of this defect but want to avoid admitting it publicly because of the embarrassment it has become to the company and the potential it has for litigation.  Or maybe they think they can make some more money selling extra power supplies....To spend this kind of money on a laptop (nearly three times as much as a comparable Windows PC) and have the power supply die after four months is simply ridiculous.  To have Apple exclude it from a basic one-year warranty is even more ridiculous.  Buyer's beware! A Macbook Pro may be a great laptop, but if you can't power it up, it is simply a brick. This power supply truly is the weak link, the Achilles heel, of what should otherwise be a great product.Apple, you may have shaved off $5 on the manufacturing costs with this power supply, but this particular decision will cost you a whole more than it saved, in the long run.  Shame on you!  I expect this kind of stuff from low-budget PC manufacturers, but not from Apple, and not after paying three times as much for the mystical Apple reliability.

Sure, there are netbooks that can hold their own in a battery war against a MacBook, but I'd like to see a netbook run Dragon Age: Origins.+ Backlit keyboard is the best looking keyboard style I've seen.  The Windows laptops with backlit keyboards just lack the finesse of a MacBook+ Unless you do major video editing (and a LOT of it), you won't miss the lack of Intel's new line of processors that the 15\" and 17\" versions (along with pretty much every Windows competitor) have.  The 2.4ghz base processor is perfectly fine for handling basic to medium level gaming, any document editing, movie watching, web surfing, or consuming any type of media.  Even if you do a lot of major video editing, you'll just have to deal with slightly longer processing times, this computer will still be able to handle the task, just not quite as fast.+ Probably the best integrated graphics chip on the market.  The pros and cons of having an integrated graphics chip instead of a discrete graphics chip are the same as those detailed about the processors in the above bullet point.+ Webcam is high quality compared to even dedicated webcams that you can purchase separately+ The most useable touchpad out of any laptop.  I came from a Windows machine where I avoided the touchpad at all costs, using a mouse 99% of the time.  However, upon switching to this laptop, I have decided that the trade for slower pointing speeds is worth it to be able to access the multitouch gestures available on this trackpad.  Now I only use a mouse when gaming.+ The MacBook is thinner and lighter than similarly sized Windows laptops.  It also has a uniformly flat design, which makes it much easier to carry around in a backpack without worrying about breaking the hinge attaching the screen to the body.Cons (when compared to Windows machines)- The cost of MacBooks compared to similarly spec'd Windows machine is much higher.  Apple also tends to be slower on the upgrade cycle than Windows machines, so the price gap is most apparent right before a new update is issued for MacBooks.- No new high end processors or discrete graphics chips.  The reason Apple didn't add the new series of processors is because with the new Core i series processors, Intel does not allow for any integrated graphics chips except for Intel integrated graphics (which can't even compare to nVidia integrated graphics).  So if they upgraded the processor, they would also have to add the discrete graphics chip, which would push the price too high.Bottom Line:Although the Pros seem to outnumber the Cons, you cannot discount the cost issue.  If you can't afford it, then you can't afford it and it's not worth breaking the bank for a laptop.  But if the MacBook is within your price range and don't require the laptop to do highly CPU/graphics intensive tasks (such as video editing) 24/7, then the overall package of the MacBook is much better than its Windows competitors.  In terms of cars, the MacBook is like an Audi A4 whereas its Windows competitors can be compared to a Chevy Camaro.  At a lower price, the Camaro can outrun an Audi pretty easily in a straight line race.  But the A4 completely outclasses the Camaro in terms of ride quality, handling, cabin tech, etc.  If you can afford the Audi and don't plan on exclusively using your car for drag strips, then go for the Audi.", "Date": "November 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Blows my Windows laptop away", "Author": "S.

I had always thought that Macs were overpriced and a bit limited in terms of their software and hardware ecosystem. Then, the combined effects of Windows Vista and the unfortunate direction taken by the Linux desktop community in recent years (KDE 4, GNOME 3) forced me to consider alternatives.I tried \"hackintoshing\" a PC by buying the OSX Box Set and installing it on PC hardware. That was enough to get me to switch to Mac OS X on a PC. But then I had occasion to use a MacBook Pro and now I am the thrilled owner of one.This is far and away the best computer I have ever owned. Don't believe the common line that Macs are just \"commodity hardware\" like I used to. Maybe there are some commodity components in them--memory, for example, and hard drives--but this is no commodity body, commodity display, or commodity mainboard.This thing really does \"just work.\" Things that have always been iffy on PCs, like sleeping, booting, and hardware configuration via BIOSes and the dreaded \"Control Panel\" (or, in Linux, kernel driver set and its per-driver options) are simply non-issues here. The machine is built like a tank, is an ergonomic pleasure to use with the best keyboard and screen I've ever experienced on any machine, desktop or laptop, it requires zero hardware configuration or even thought, and it sleeps and wakes up, connects to wireless networks, detects and accesses USB devices, and all the rest reliably and instantly. What's more, it's absolutely, ruthlessly silent, runs cold as ice, and the battery lasts forever and ever!Things really do \"just work.\"Before having used a MacBook Pro for an extended period of time, I was sure that a laptop with \"average\" specs for the market couldn't be worth several times what the equivalent ThinkPad (which is what I tended to use over the years) cost. Now I'm sure it's worth every penny; I've been saved many hours of aggravation I didn't even realize I didn't have to experience, and the use of this machine is so much more transparent than PCs ever were, even after 20+ years of Windows and Unix/Linux-on-PC operating systems.You forget the Mac is there; it becomes a part of you in a way that other hardware/software platforms never did.If it sounds as though I've been converted to the Cult of Mac / Cult of Apple, it's because I have. This machine is worth every penny, is easily the best computer I've ever owned (and I got my first in 1984), and I'm not sure I can ever go back to using commodity hardware or non-Apple software again.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Impressed.", "Author": "M.

I bought this macbook because I've heard of its stability, but I was wrong, it freezes as often as I use \"heavy\" applications or Microsoft softwares. And you cant go back to work without restarting the computer using the power button!2 Disappointing video card. Doesn't handle even light pictures adjustments without minutes seen that little colored circle asking you to wait, that is just unacceptable for a macbook pro.3 Most Apple softwares are not so complete and easy to use as others say, its hard to manage email contacts, you cant add them easily from your email,  the software erases all your emails from your email account from the first access, need to adjust that manually, besides is gonna ask you the password over and over again all day long, no matter what you do; doesn't recognize windows files (fat32/NTFS format used in your pen drive or external HD), you must buy and install an special software for that; the Iwork doesn't replace fully the MS Office; the Aperture is to basic if compared with Photoshop or similar; Itunes is freaky to use; the Quicktime doesn't run avi, Divx or most of nowadays video formats, you must get Quicktime pro for that or pay for a bunch of plugins; the Finder (Apple Explorer) is not able to  search a file in a specific folder, is gonna check all your folders; you cant maximize to the biggest screen possible at the proper button, you must adjust the screen manually every time, very annoying.4 The keyboard gets dirty and greasy easily, looks like someone used oil in a cotton to \"clean it up\", and have a large space under the keys, that keeps the dirt under it, they seems to have not project that very well.5 It gets very hot with heavy applications.6 No separated mic and headphones connections, they are the same, very awkward for a Pro unit.7 The informations under it (serial number, etc) are almost gone, its erasing easily with just a few months.8 Firewire port is not the standard one, you must get a proper Apple cable.9 You need also to buy an Apple adapter to video out.10 Just two USB ports.11 No blu-ray reader available on Macs at all.12 Small and slow hard drive for the price.13 I expected a lot more performance out of a core 2 duo processor on a MAC OS, video editing or large pictures editing is not reasonable on this unit, HD videos is just unthinkable, get a core i5/i7 with a discrete video card and a ssd driver if po$$ible.14 Speakers are not loud enough for Skype use or video watching if you're not in a closed and very quite space.Overall its a good equipment, but miles away from perfection.

Good so I don't have to get into that, so lets start by comparing the different 13\" Macs available.Lets start by comparing it to its slightly better equipped sibling, the other 13\" option. Packing a better CPU and added hard drive space are the only thing that separates the two models. Now does the 2.66GHZ and 70GB justify the $300 price increase. A 500GB laptop hard drive can be purchased for around $60 Seagate Momentus 5400 500GB 5400RPM SATA 3Gb/s 8MB Cache 2.5 Inch Internal NB Hard Drive ST9500325AS-Bare Drive (that hard drive has been reported to outperform similar size 7200RPM models). An extra 266MHZ for $300....no thanks.Now its albino step brother, the MacBook. Lacking 2GB of RAM, Firewire port and SD card slot. Dressed in a polycarbonate unibody opposed to aluminum, the MacBook is ever so slightly bigger. Weighing in at 0.2LBS more and 0.13\" thicker then the Pro but weighing $200 less on the wallet, the MacBook is a contender. Now considering the extra 2GB for the MacBook can be added by apple for around $100 at time of purchase and the 4GB can also be bought for $200 after purchasing (cheaper alternatives do exist but those are the apple recommended RAM). I personally think the added RAM, ports, and aluminum case are a great package deal at $200.Last of the 13\" is its anorexic cousin, the MacBook Air. Now the Pro is not MacBook Air light (1.5 pounds difference) or thin (0.19\" thicker), but its still not heavy enough to be even a slight burden when lugging it around. Factor in the significant performance you gain (1.86GHZ vs 2.4GHZ, 2GB more ram, 130GB more space and better video card) along with the $350 less then the air the pro is easily the winner. Not to mention the 5 hour increase in battery life and DVD drive. Do keep in mind that the Air is due for an upgrade soon.I'm not going to talk about how it runs because after all it is a Mac. Saying that its runs fast goes without saying. My biggest concern for laptops has always been heat. Heat and electronics get along like Apple and Adobe...not good and with reports that bigger I-7 models can get hot enough to boil water, the 13\" runs surprisingly and refreshingly cool. Even comparing it to my 3 year old 15\" MacBook Pro their is a massive difference in temperature. I can leave it on my lap or bed and I can not believe that its not hot. The Battery is also amazing, its seems to last forever.

I loved that computer, but the plastic was starting to show signs of wear after only a year and a half of use, so it was time to upgrade to an aluminum unibody MBP. I love this computer. OSX is such an easy to use operating system. I actually found when I switched from Windows to OSX, some tasks I would try to make harder than they were simply because I was used to Windows. When you hear people say that once they made the switch, they'd never go back, believe them.But, of course there are some gripes, although few. My biggest complaint is two fold: no hdmi ports, no BluRay support. Those two are really killers. Don't get me wrong, it's easy enough to get the necessary cables to hook the computer up to your HDTV, but it would be much easier with an HDMI. It really seems silly that a laptop this nice and this powerful doesn't have HD capabilities. BUT, I'm sure that those two things are PROBABLY coming in the next refresh, which will mean I'll likely have to upgrade again in a year or so, but I can deal with that. My only other gripe is with the display. The glass display is much more vibrant and lively than the old LCD's, but here is a significant amount of glare on the screen. Forget about using it in the sun at all.Lastly, a couple of tips. The \"10 hour battery life\" is a lie. No way does this thing get ten hours. BUT, if you turn off the backlit keyboard and turn the screen brightness down to 50%, you can easily get 5-7 hours of operation. I think for most folks that will get the job done. Also, learn to love the trackpad. I think that's the thing I like the most about the computer.

I have used several operating systems many from Microsoft, several Linux distributions and Solaris. MAC OS X has been the best experience I have had so far. In addition if you are used to the UNIX terminal, it's the same in MAC OS X. MAC OS X is so much nicer, easier to configure than any other, GUI is very friendly and accessible far more than Windows. This machine is the cheapest 2010 Macbook Pro, yet it is packed with power that I will never use even though I am a hardcore power user. The machine is so fast and the software is very responsive and quick.I find that older PC laptops from 2004 and under are still living to date. More modern machines from 2006 and up are dying within 6 months to a year or they become faulty within the same time. Machines especially that came with Windows Vista had this characteristic. You would have to buy a machine almost every year to year and a half.I recommend Apple. I have known people who have had a MAC for years. No issues, doesn't become slow, fast and powerful, friendly and they just work. Apple's worldwide support and apple care coverage is also a winner. Buy your machine and if it goes bad, anywhere in the world you are, and there is an Apple store and you are under warranty, you can get it fixed, no questions asked.MAC OS X itself comes with powerful software already installed. IPhoto, Garage Band, IMOVIE, ITUNES you can do so much with. It syncs my windows mobile phone better than windows 7 did!! Syncing my contacts and all in my address book. People who worry about their windows software not working, Parallels desktop Virtual Machine is available, Virtual Box whichever, you can run your windows software in there or install windows on your MAC legally by bootcamp assistant which MAC OS X provides for you free and installed already. By the way most windows software, there is a high possibility there exists a MAC version so don't worry.You may find apple a bit expensive but it's worth it for the product you get, the software, the power in the machine and the international support. Not to mention you don't need to buy a computer ever again once you by an apple.

But, I am going to be objective with this review because I definitely am not in the Mac \"Cult\" as I always called it before I bought one.First - the feel, aesthetics and look on this machine is what first catches your eyes. It is clearly well built, feels sturdy and akin to the one reviewer comparing it to a German car...It's just got that feeling of being well put together.There are some things that take some getting used to as compared to a PC. The keyboard short cuts are a little strange, the only thing I can imagine is that this is to avoid accidental key commands??? Getting around the operating system is different but becoming a bit more natural now after 2 weeks. The machine does boot up pretty quickly and I haven't had any problems with the programs as of yet. Though, I haven't really started adding to the machine (in transition). The machine does what it should (and, as it should given the price tag).I was concerned about repurchasing software that I have had on Windows, but the boot camp utility is terrific. It easily allows for the partition and running of another Windows OS (I am using Windows 7 professional).  I have installed my software on to that, to avoid rebuying the expensive stuff. It was a breeze and Apple's guide is simple to do that, anyone could do it!The specifications are rather good and solid. More than enough for the average computer user. I've got Adobe programs which run fine!  Though I don't know the video editing/gaming - but imagine it'll be good too.The battery is unbelievable. You can probably get the 9-10 the advertise in a low power, low application running state, but even when you are on it, the thing lasts! You get spoiled really easily.Everything so far has led me to believe that this will last and be consistent through my use of the machine.To the people who loathe windows now, there is some things that come with the territory of buying big manufactured PCs (Apple isn't huge in terms of the amount of people who own them)...slower speeds with use is common - you have to take care of certain things. Windows 7 is a lot better than Vista. But I suppose that's another review...Anyways... I would suggest this to anyone curious of making the jump that truly use computers often. If you're a casual user who just goes on the book or space, email and word processing - save your money! But if you are looking to run heavy applications or have a solid machine and can poney up the money, I would say go for it.

It's late 2010 and a Core 2 Duo processor should not be in a laptop sold at this price. The Core 2 Duo works fine, but its old and everyone else has a Core iX processor.- The integrated NVIDIA graphics card is good, but once again Apple could have opted for a DX11 card or something like that.- The 250 GB of hard drive space is not a lot and the 5400 rpm sometimes will slow down if you are performing heavier tasks on itHopefully Apple will address all of these issues at this week's Back to Mac event, and I can switch mines in for the newer ones :)Now the good about the laptop- The laptop feels really solid. From the moment you first pull it out of the box to everyday usage, it feels really solid. It's not like the HP junk where the plastic is falling apart. The MBP is on par with the Asus gaming laptops for really well built design- This laptop is really lightweight. It's awesome. Really good for on the go- Really good battery life. The 10 hour is BS, but on OS X, I get about 8 hours of usage, and in Windows 7 on Boot Camp I get about 6 hours of battery life. This is really good- The backlit keyboard on this thing is awesome. Not too many laptops have backlit keyboards. But the backlights are really useful at night, especially for us college students who are always up at night- Even though I listed my complaints above, the laptop still performs really well. Whether you are in OS X or in Windows 7 on Boot Camp, you get pretty good performance. Don't expect this thing to play Crysis on MAX settngs, but I was able to get pretty decent gameplay on Left 4 Dead 2This laptop overall is a really good buy. I would try to look around for a seller on Amazon who might be selling it cheaper, but even the Amazon price is really good, since there is no tax.

This computer is now DEAD and I am going to sell it on e-bay as a parts computer.This laptop lasted about 2 1/2 years. In my opinion it's life was shortened because it ran far too hot. To prevent overheating my son would occasionally take the back off and clean it. If I recall right some people seemed to think this issue was caused by the Nivida graphics.The heat issue has apparently been fixed in the 2013 Macs with the new Intel i7 processor.This laptop was too expensive to only last 2 1/2 years. My first Mac was far cost less and it lasted almost 6 years. It would still be working had the screen not been broken.If you choose to buy the newest version of this laptop I highly recommend that you buy the longest lasting extended warranty you can buy.

Today, the price premium has been negated by the longevity and simplicity of the machine's operation.  I'm able to use my computer like a quality tool; I turn it on, accomplish my tasks, and then I turn it off... I don't waste time fixing issues or tinkering with the hardware or OS.

Computers are supposed to be tools so we can work with them, and not for them.Once you open your macbook and set up your account, you find everything in place working as it should be, so you only concentrate in using it.Several aspects of the macbook I have noted as follow:1)Speed. Every application is fast, not hassle, no crashes. Every piece of the macbook is made one for another. As every computer is meant to be.2)Graphics. Let me say here, that this is something you will hear from every mac owner, and you may take it for granted, until you see it with your own eyes. This is something so amazing, describing it will just not be enough. Movies, pictures, every image and picture is just outstanding.3)Applications. Many applications have a mac equivalent, so finding Microsoft office for mac will not be a problem, photoshop, divx, vlc, and many others. Some pre-loaded applications are awesome, like the iPhoto, iMovie and iTunes.4)Security. Surely there is no perfect software, but this is as close to perfection as computing can get. There is not many viruses for mac, and it comes with an integrated firewall. You feel safer browsing the web and working with your macbook.5)Battery Life. The macbook pro with core 2 duo processors advertise 10 hours battery life. While that is turning everything off and to the minimum, with decent use and wifi turned on I get more than 6 hours. I've even got 8 hours with brightness at medium, no keyboard lights and wifi turned on.6)Sleep function. This is a flawless aspect of the macbook. It sleeps when you close the lid, so you don't really have to turn it off. It lasts days in sleep mode without need of charge. Really nice feature. Surely.7)Screen size. At first I was worried my 13 inch laptop will be too small. Now let me say that this is not a problem. 13 inch will not be a problem, unless you have a specialized profession where screen size will be a must.Mac will change the way you use computing, and while there are many similar features in other OS, with your mac you feel the laptop is made for the software, and the software is made for the hardware.

Actually I replaced my old Toshiba with another Toshiba and I replaced my old MacBook with this Pro.  I think both have their merits but I prefer the Apple for everyday use.  Without getting too deep into the specs, which you can read anywhere, I'll compare it to the previous generation and the average laptop on the market.Pros: Support - both in person and automated.  OutstandingThe Screen - Brilliant, sturdy, and quite a bit brighter than the last generationConstruction - This is the most sturdy machine I've ever used.  The aluminum body is amazing.Battery Life - I'm running on full brightness and have music playing as I type and I've got an estimated 8 hours left on this charge.Features - I love the SD card slot.  My old Toshiba had one but I've not seen one in a while.  I use it extensively.Migration Manager - I was able to move everything from my old machine quickly and easily, including my MS Office and all my passwords.Backlit Keyboard - Why oh why have we had to wait so long?Size and weight - I ride a motorcycle and a bicycle most of the time and I carry it on my back.  I love the size and weight of the new machine.  I considered the Air, but I'm not convinced it's not just a gimmick.Cons:The USB ports are too close together.  Can't use simultaneously so why have two?Doesn't come pre-loaded with MS Office, but Open Office is almost as good.It's expensive.  Not extremely expensive, but for a machine that is going to last this long and is so easy to use, the 13\" is still a deal.It's slippery; when I try to open it with one finger, it slides around.The finish on the aluminum doesn't show finger prints but it does show little scratches.  I'll probably buy a plastic case for it down the road.Long story short: I didn't have to spend much time getting to know the new machine and that's awesome.  It started right up with all my stuff loaded on it and it was just like an old friend.  It took me a week or so to figure out some of the differences in keyboard shortcuts, but I'm now more dialed-in than I was with my old machine.

My problem comes from the fact that an apple employee ensured me at that time, that macbook pro 13\" will never have the i5 built into them because they are too small and lightweight to support such a processor.  I trusted them and got it, few months later here is the i5 for sale for the exact same price.  If he said he didn't know, I'd be fine with that.  He did explain to me however, like he was so confident about Macbook Pro 13\" never having the possibilities of an i5 processor.Another incident where an apple employee lied is when I purchased the ipod touch 4th generation.  At the time it was purchased, I asked a representative why the camera is not as clear as the iphone 4's camera.  She assured me that once their is a new update, the ipod 4's camera will be HD like in the iphone.  Still hasn't happened..I do not trust apple employees anymore.My apple products have not been as good as expected.  They lag all the time, and have blacked out at me many times- it's pretty scary.

This machine is safer browsing web page but it more dangerous because there are many hackers out there with bad advice and too many programs to change the way you custom your system. A backup system is a necessity. Pages and Numbers are Ok. Windows 7 has no mail and this has mail. The mail is not great but it is ok.  This is just a dual core machine when the world is using i3,i5,i7 machines at this price level. It does have on neat feature of letting you take all kinds of screen shots.  The screen shots on this is much better than windows has and I love this feature. I do not like the idea of putting windows 7 or XP on this machine. The extra heat, weaker security, and poorer battery are too much. This machine is not best for .net developers in my opinion. This notebook can be a lot of fun if you want to spend a lot of work learning to use it but you will have to have another machine to do real work on. This machine is fun at first but it gets old real fast. If buying a used one check the age and shape of battery and Apple Care and Dents. The battery can swell up if too many charges. It can blow or cause a lot of damage, so replace it if needed. A big problem is also that this machine only has two usb ports. They are close together and I can not connect a mouse and some of my usb drives. I do not like the mouse pad. It has a few features some people like to play with but I prefer a mouse. My best mouse will not work on mac machines but I have several good logitech mouses that work well. You do have to learn how to handle the wireless on this. If you can not get into your linksys router just try changing the channel.This is a portable machine but why are people getting this over the Hp 2540p. They both get hot but the hp is built better. Snow leopard is needed for xcode 3.2. Xcode does not feel right for me. I liked visual basic and even old C or C++ better. I love having external databases to keep track of my data and can not have that with a mac. You can see from the comments on this that money is behind this. Or maybe is is just apple pushing hype hard and winning.Note also the backlit keyboard is a nice feature but it is not needed most of the time and is best to turn it off.Also note, you need a cover to side your notebook when buying before it gets scratchs and dents.
