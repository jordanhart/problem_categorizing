It's a pain in the .. to get used to windows 8 but once yo get used to it the whole thing it's pretty easy to enjoy. It was a good purchase in terms of price/specs because I don't needed an ultra fast jet/laptop. It \"fits\" perfectly for my needs.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor wireless performance.

Frequent disconnects, link speed would drop to ~5Mbps. No resolution as of yet.-Back-lit keyboard can be annoying. The island style keys sit well above the LEDs below, allowing the light to shine directly at you. You can disable the back-light entirely, but you cannot change the brightness.-Viewing angles on display are not great.-Intel case badge was crooked : (I ended up replacing the stock WLAN card with an Intel Centrino 6235. This resolved the wireless issues. Unfortunately, the USB 2.0 ports on the right-hand side stopped working three weeks in.

I didn't realize it had a i3 (instead of i5) processor until I ordered (because.. apparently I can't read, so) but it hasn't seemed to make THAT much of a difference in functionality. Main pro, for me at least, with this upgrade, is the battery life.

It is advertised as a touchscreen laptop in the video accompanying the pics but it is not a touchscreen.  I called Amazon Customer Service to ask if they sent the wrong computer but never got a straight answer.  After speaking with two different supervisors over a period of two hours and promises of rectifying the problem I was finally advised this laptop should not have been listed as a touchscreen in the video.  Their solution was to put another computer in my shopping cart to review which cost another 150.00 dollars over what I had already spent.  I felt they should have comped me a touchscreen computer for the same price since it was their error but of course they didn't see it that way.  They also stated it was being removed from their site since it wasn't advertised correctly.  I see that after two days it's still there.  This is false advertisement in my opinion and it smells of switch and bait.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "USER MANUAL", "Author": "Brandes Enrique \"ENRIQUE BRANDES\"", "ReviewID": "R1CLRNJRHEHR7H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "DO YOU SELL  SVF14212CXB USER MANUAL?OTHERWISE WHERE CAN I DOWNLOAD IT?THANKSENRIQUEPS I BOUGHT THIS ITEM BUT I DIDN'T RECEIVE YET, THEN I WANT STUDY NOW", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CFGVPOW"}}
