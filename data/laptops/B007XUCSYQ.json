It is less than the regular ultrabook with the i7, but i think the i5 has enough for regular office and internet use. If you need a great gaming or design software computer i would spend the money for the i7.There is no cd player, but you have to ask yourself, do we even use those any more anyway? I prefer it w/o anyway for weight reason and the battery life is ridiculously awesome.Overall, very happy with our purchase as it is perfect for what we needed.", "Date": "June 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Ultrabook for the Price", "Author": "photoman", "ReviewID": "RRWYMKNFQU6RE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought mine at WalMart on 9/29/12 and had to travel to a store 45 miles away to get the last one in the area.  It has a great battery life, longer than any laptop I have ever had.  It boots up/shuts down in seconds.  The look and feel is very nice.  The aluminum top makes it as nice as a Mac Air.  I really like the lighted keyboard, but use sparingly because it depletes the battery a bit quicker.  I think it is a very nice machine for $500; too bad they are all sold out, even online.I had to download and update the Fresco driver to get the USB 3.0 drive to work.  You will probably need to buy a USB extender (2.0 or 3.0) because you will need more ports.I installed Adobe's Lightroom 3 and uploaded 240 RAW pictures via a Compact Flash reader.  It took 5 minutes to import all of the pics.  Editting was a breeze.  When I exported to the SSD in JPG format, it took 5 1/2 minutes to process for of the pictures.  Therefore, I can say that the HP3000 GPU and the i3 processor struggles to handle this type of application. This is the reason for the 4 stars. All other applications seem to work fine.", "Date": "October 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good laptop", "Author": "thanhphan", "ReviewID": "ROX1YCEB5INVH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great laptop, having this laptop for 4 days, everything works well so far. The screen is not one of the best but acceptable. Keyboard and trackpad works very well. Battery up to 5 hours depends on how you use it. I got 5 hours for surfing the internet and watching youtube. I used torrent and let the screen be turned off, it got up to 8-9 hours. It gets some heat and can be quite hot at the bottom but you will rarely notice it unless you touch the bottom. So far so good, it's very light and thin. I usually use it for email, webs, movies when I'm at school and I really like it! But I have to take off 1 star because of the battery and the screen, but other than those, everything is perfect.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "HP folio 13", "Author": "Randall Larson", "ReviewID": "R1TPN62EUBLS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My first HP folio 13 was so good, I bought this one for may daughter to use at college.

I was encouraged to buy from this company because of their warranty, I have heard horror stories of peole buying used/refurbished computers and found they didn't work. Well this one is perfect, and I will absolutely buy their 2 year warrranty.I would definitely refer them to friends, and will continue to use this company!Thank you", "Date": "January 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent small laptop, fast SSD.", "Author": "Tranche", "ReviewID": "REOMNJ84P10MN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purposely waited six months before reviewing this computer simply because it takes time to fairly evaluate this type of purchase.  I'm happy to report that there have been no issues whatsoever with this computer.  It's just great -- very light and well made, with aluminum panel case.  The SSD, which attracted me to this computer in the first place, is very fast and allows for quick boot-up.  Also, I'm happy with the Windows 7 OS after reading all the horror stories about Windows 8.  (Actually, I was satisfied with the XP OS in my old laptop.)  As for the CPU, the i3 appears to be more than adequate for my light business demands -- MS Office, etc.  Not sure that the extra cost of an i5 or i7 machine would be justified in my case.  And, regarding the subject of cost, I'm a little surprised that this computer, which I purchased for $500, now sells on Amazon for $780.  C'mon Jeff.  At least it's available again; it had sold out shortly after my purchase in early July '13.Regarding the absence of a CD/DVD drive, I was concerned about this initially but now find that it's a blessing.  I travel, so I appreciate that the size and weight of this machine have been kept to a minimum.  I bought a USB powered portable DVD at a very reasonable price to load software.  Good to leave this at home when I travel.The only minor negatives are the smallish screen size and less than 1080 resolution.  Of course, this is really just a trade-off; if you want a monster 17\" screen with full HD, you will pay for it -- extra dollars and extra weight.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice , quick , lite", "Author": "Dave C.", "ReviewID": "R3KQACNKFRDLW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "after a week of constant updates , i'm getting used to the move from Xp to Windows 7  ...  it does freeze up once in a while  ,...but i almost expect those issues from any Windows system .. !  it is very lite weight , nice battery life if needed  ...  feels much much faster doing everything than Win Xp  ...  still getting used to slight tighter keyboard , but the Backlit keys are great .. !", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for road warriors", "Author": "Wilton Wong \"Wilt\"", "ReviewID": "RVEGM9M1OIPTZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Such a compact and lightweight design for a very capable product!  Being accustomed to a work laptop provided by my employer which has only 60GB harddrive, living with 120GB SSD will not be a problem.  Besides, putting a large capacity SDxC into the slot bolsters its capacity significantly over the standard SSD.  I love how it so rapidly starts up, and its very extended battery life.
