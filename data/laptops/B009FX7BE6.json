For starters the video card is shared memory. And you have to upgrade to a 1920x1080 screen. Seriously? On a gaming laptop?Alienware USED to be top of the line, but those days have long past especially with Dell's purchase.I dont work for a sales company or anything. I'm a gamer that got burned by a \"name\".If you want the name for some reason, go ahead. These laptops look nice, but if you're looking for better quality at FAR cheaper prices, do some research..there are sites out there that let you do custom builds and I'm not talking about the two main ones everyone knows about.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hardly Linux Compatible", "Author": "Bluecount", "ReviewID": "RTHY876H3DT5S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Out of the box, the latest version of Ubuntu and Linux Mint won't install.  This is as annoying as the fact that it ships with Win 8 instead of Win 7.  To be useful as a Linux laptop, you must dual boot Windows and your preferred Linux flavor, and when you're in windows you have to press the (Fn + I/D GFX) which implies that it's a switch button to switch between your integrated or discrete graphics card...  I think what it really does is disable/ enable the Enduro feature in the AMD/ATI graphics card which is EXTREMELY BUGGY.  With that 'feature' disabled, you should be able to install any Linux operating system normally just like you would on an actual pricey, high-end laptop...But still I notice some nasty artifacts and flashing with things like the brightness changer and the 'roll up' effect on the start menu (you know, when you set it to auto-hide).  With certain settings, graphics settings, the graphics card stops refreshing during the login and screen lock screens, so it looks all glitched out.  Very unfortunate, but you can still type in your username/password, you just can't see it.The screen quality (or maybe graphics quality) is extremely nice, when I first played an FPS I thought the screen must be refreshing at 120hz or something, but it must just have 'very little ghosting' or something like that.If you intend to install Steam on Ubuntu, I would NOT recommend this laptop.  Pay full price and get an nVidia based gaming laptop instead.", "Date": "March 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "it is a cheat!!!", "Author": "BEN_MA", "ReviewID": "R22VG7YZJ6P3JT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it is a cheat!my friend bought it for me,as many customer say,the machine's display is 1600*900,not the 1920*1080!how Amazon can do this!it is a terrible experience!and i live in China,when i know about it,the machine is on the way to my home!NIGHTMARE!", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fake\uff01\uff01", "Author": "Costumer", "ReviewID": "R546DKS9EZJ20", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Never buy this crap!
