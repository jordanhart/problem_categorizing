The brushed aluminum looks good and doesn't show fingerprints.Windows 8.1 - Those who are complaining about windows 8 are clueless.  It took me no time at all to have it looking and functioning just like XP or 7 .  You still have most of functionality and design of Win7 with the option to use Metro.Touchscreen - If you like this sort of thing it seems to work well, but I don't really use it.Backlit keyboard.  It's nice to have and is easy to turn on and off.The not so good:The touch pad isn't that smooth, no where near the quality of say Apple's but still passable.The screen has a lot of glare. I suppose this is unavoidable with a touchscreen?Overall the I7 1.8ghz processor is okay but a little slow, it does have the Haswell architecture which helps with battery life.The 5400rpm 750gb HDD...ugh.  This almost kept me from buying this machine.  I have no idea why companies are stillreleasing laptops with these slow HDD's.  The hard drive is the real bottleneck for this PC's performance. I plan on replacing the slow drive with a SSD.  Add the purchase price plus $200 for a SSD and you still have a great deal.This laptop does not fold flat or in to tent mode.It is a little difficult to open, I have to use both hands.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop with a few quirks", "Author": "xeno", "ReviewID": "RNE1PPPNVUKGK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've purchased two of these laptops recently, and I can say that I am more than satisfied with my purchases.  I spent a good deal of time researching the different Acer laptops, and came to the conclusion that this machine was the best value out of all the ones that I saw.Some of the pros of this machine:i7 Haswell processorFull HD IPS screenTouchscreenMsata portBacklit keyboardAesthetically pleasingBattery lifeI really wanted an Acer V5 or V7 because of the design.  It is thin, lightweight, and just has a nice look to it.  I wish I didn't care too much about aesthetics, but after having lots of thicker laptops over the years, I was in the mood for something that looked nicer.There are lots of varying models of the V5 and V7.  For the price, this seems to be the best of their builds.  The only thing lacking in this model is a nicer graphics card.  Most of their other models include the 720p screen, which did not impress and had terrible viewing angles.  I find the viewing angle important because I use these for work, and I'm often not right in front of the screen, so I like the fact that this laptop has excellent viewing angles with the IPS screen.  The downside of 1080p on a 15.6\" screen is that the fonts are small, so you may need to adjust them slightly in the settings, which was easy.Some cons:Font sizes on 1080p 15.6\" screenTouchpad that can be glitchy at timePlacement of HDMI, USB 3.0 portsThe touchpad tends to be a bit sensitive.  It is the type that has no separate buttons, however, you can push the edge of the touchpad where the mouse buttons would normally be, and it functions the same.  I found that turning off the 2-finger menu option helped a lot (you scroll with two fingers, but for some reason they also had an option set that would open a menu when placing two fingers down, so it would open a menu every time I would try to scroll).The HDMI and USB 3.0 ports are on the back.  There are two USB 2.0 ports on the side.  I wish they had put the USB 3.0 on the side, so that you can have access to each type of port when you need them.  Reaching around the laptop to put in a USB flash drive isn't that great.  I would suggest buying a mini one so that it doesn't hang out too far if the unit is on your lap or the end of a desk near a wall.I installed a mSATA into one unit (the other got a standard SATA SSD), but getting Windows over there isn't the easiest.  You can't just use one of the free copy programs such as EaseUS, because it won't register the new drive in the UEFI bios.  I used a simple tool from Paragon software that allowed me to copy the drive and register it in the bios, but it does cost twenty bucks.  If you want to upgrade to a standard ssd, then you can simply create a usb recovery drive in the Recovery menu in Control Panel, install the drive, and then put in the USB and turn the unit back on.  It will then recover windows to the SSD.  For some reason, the recovery will only recognize a standard SATA drive as the boot drive, and not the mSATA.  In any case, if none of that makes sense, then write a comment and will try to check back and answer.  BTW - I have a near instant boot with the SSD installed.Overall, this is a great laptop for my needs.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "At the right price, this machine is unbeatable!", "Author": "M. Wong", "ReviewID": "R224AHHBBS779C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this from the Microsoft Store for $599, and at that price, you cannot really find a better deal. However, if I was going to spend closer to the thousand dollars amazon is asking, I'd want a SSD.Screen: If you need a bigger screen, this is a really great choice. It's crisp, clear, and you can open multiple windows side by side and still be able to read them. There is some glare in sunlight or if there's a light at a direct angle to the screen, but I've found that with all touchscreens. For me, it's not a big deal.The touchscreen handles up to 10 fingers, so you can do many, many things by touch. This is not a convertible laptop, though--you cannot lay the screen flat or flip it over onto the keyboard. It's still just a regular laptop. But I still find myself using touch for some things and a mouse for others. It's really nice to have the choice.Processor: The fourth generation i7 processor sold me--most in this price range run i5 or a previous generation.Sound: It has four speakers using Dolby surround sound, which makes for great listening for normal, everyday use. I don't know what a gamer or music enthusiast would say, but it gets loud (which I sometimes find lacking in laptops) and sounds decent.Keyboard: It has a full keyboard, complete with number pad, is backlit, and still allows for that tactile experience. I like my keyboards to have a little more depth to them, but I've gotten used to this one pretty quickly. The backlighting is a welcome bonus. I also like that it has volume, brightness, and music player controls built in. I only wish it had a calculator button like my external keyboard does. Also, I would really like a little more space between the regular keyboard and the number pad--I have had a hard time adjusting to finding the delete key (but that's a super picky thing--I understand that there's only so much width to a laptop).Drive: I agree with an other reviewer: you need a SSD (solid state drive) to make this an exceptional computer; however, for most users, this laptop will be plenty fast (we're talking a one-second or so delay from clicking to happening for most things)--only those used to SSDs will have an issue. For my needs, adding a mSSD (not replacing the HDD already installed) will be perfect.Overall--I am extremely happy with this purchase.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Value - Almost Perfect but not quite there", "Author": "BangAndOlufsen", "ReviewID": "R3B4YUZOUDL28N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this laptop from an Amazon Marketplace Seller and it arrived very quickly, in about 4 days.  I had also ordered a Crucial 120 GB mSata SSD drive on the same day.  Unfortunately, the mSata drive took 10 days to arrive so when I received this laptop, all I did was just turn it on and made sure it worked.Once the mSata SSD drive arrived, it was time to reformat the laptop and do a fresh install of Windows 8 on the mSata SSD drive.  Since this laptop didn't have a SSD drive, the most economical option for performance boost is to buy a mSata SSD drive and use it as the boot drive for the operating system.  Then use the Sata drive that came with the laptop for data storage, which in this case is a nice 750 GB capacity.Installing the mSata drive was quite easy.  I turned the laptop over, unscrewed the 20 screws, and removed the bottom panel to expose the full motherboard.  Then I just seated the mSata SSD drive into the mSata slot and screwed it onto the board.  After that, I removed the 750 GB Sata HDD drive and just set it to the side.  I went into the BIOS to make sure the laptop saw the mSata drive, which it did.  Then I proceeded to install a fresh Windows 8 ISO onto the mSata drive by booting up the laptop through my USB stick and running the installation.  After that, the laptop was running purely on a mSata drive with no Sata drive in it.  I then reformatted the Sata HDD drive and put it back into the laptop to be used for data storage.In inspecting the motherboard, there is one RAM slot that is upgradeable and contains a AData 2 GB stick of RAM.  The other RAM slot has RAM soldered onto the board.  I plan to upgrade the memory from the current 6GB to 12GB by replacing the 2GB stick with a 8GB stick.  Hopefully, there won't be any issues with running a 4GB RAM stick with a 8GB stick, i.e. RAM with mismatched sizes.Now onto the actual useability and performance:Pros:- The 1920x1080 HD IPS screen is beautiful.  Very vivid colors and very bright.- Nice \"looking\" back-lit keyboard with numeric keypad.  More on the keyboard later- Performance is fast and rock solid.  The speed may be due to the SSD that I installed as I don't know how it performed out of the box.  Running PcMark 8 \"home conventional test\" which involves browsing and light gaming received a score of 2388 which didn't seem too impressive although this score was rated as 29% better than the average score for an ultrabook, which was 2179.- WIFI is actually very good.  Good range and no connection drops as reported by some people.  Maybe the Atheros WIFI driver got its issues fixed.- Temperature - stays cool.  Never felt any heat on the palm rests while using it for hours.- Battery life - I'm on the fence about this one.  Right now, I can get a max of about 4 hours and 45 mins with not too heavy of use - surfing the web and doing some Java coding.  It's still better than my Samsung Series 5 NP530U4C-A01US laptop which usually got around 3 hours 45 mins.  I was hoping this laptop would get 6-7 hours.  I'm hoping the battery life will improve after a couple of full discharges of the battery.  I had a Acer Timeline X a few years back and noticed that the battery got better after a few months use.- Pretty good speakers even though I find laptop speakers generally uselessCons:- Weight - this isn't a big drawback, it's just not super light for an \"ultrabook\".  It weighs around 4.8 lbs, which is ok for a 15.6\" laptop.  It's also not super thin like the Samsung Series 9 books.- The keyboard is very average.  It just doesn't have a soft, precise feel that I like.  The travel is very shallow due to the \"ultrabook\" design.  Typing is pretty accurate once you get used to it.- The track pad is too sensitive.  I find myself highlighting and accidentally dragging things when moving the cursor around.  The off-center placement of the track pad is actually ok since it still aligns underneath the center keys of the keyboard.  I thought it would be a pain or something that I needed to get used to.- The right side fan can get loud at times when doing cpu intensive tasks such as video editing.  Normal use, it's ok.  I generally don't hear the fan while working because I listen to music with headphones.- No VGA out.  There's a proprietary Acer converter port that has different dongles such as VGA, LAN.  The laptop did not come with any dongles, so I couldn't use the VGA input on my home monitor.  I ended up having to buy an HDMI-to-DVI cable from Monoprice to use the monitor.All in all, I'd say this laptop has excellent value.  There is no other laptop that you can get with a I7 Haswell chip and 1920x1080 resolution for less than $1500.  This one only cost me around $725 and another $80 for the mSata SSD upgrade, which makes it a great buy in my opinion.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Overall very good", "Author": "Fahim", "ReviewID": "R3MCYV8TCHCG4Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am a college student and this laptop has many good qualities; however, there are also some bad things to note about this laptop.Pros-Backlit Keyboard-Bluetooth-1080p Screen-Stays very cool-boots quickly from sleep-full size keyboard with number pad-Core i7 even if it is a mobile processor its still very good and speedy-IPS screen good for outdoor visibility-Battery life is really good, can get about 5 hours easy while watching HD movies-lightweight for me since i'm coming from a 17.3 inch 7 lb laptop.

The screen is big and bright and I'm surprised at how well the touch screen works.  It works nicely with Windows 8.  Just upgraded to 8.1 with no issues.Some minor quibbles: it's a shame they put the Core i7 with the 5400 rpm hard drive.  Clearly that's the limiting component.  I was thinking that I would replace it with an SSD, but I've since read that on these models it is somewhat challenging (not impossible) to replace the drive.  You might want to research that further if this is your plan.  I was also somewhat disappointed with Acer's specs on this unit which claim that it has a VGA port, but it doesn't.  I need to use a variety of projectors and some only have VGA.  Minor workaround is to get an adapter, but they shouldn't claim VGA if it isn't there.I'm reasonably happy with the purchase considering the price point.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GK6GIM2"}}
