This is a beautiful machine for the discriminating power user.", "Author": "David Bernstein", "ReviewID": "R21TEXYE58XB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is a beautiful piece of engineering from HP. I am a techy guy/road warrior and I am very picky about laptops. In my opinion this is the only credible alternative, in some ways a better alternative, to the Mac Book Pro. The touch pad is very well done, it is just like Apple's. And unlike Dell touchpads, the software drivers are very well done, they dont suck up background CPU and the two-finger gestures work well. The screen and keyboard are really great. A couple of special features here, there are USB ports on the left and right, to accommodate whichever side you might want to put a mouse on. The is no built in CD/DVD drive, there is one that comes separate, which is fine for me, I pretty much never use a CD/DVD. This saves weight and size. The touch screen is a really nice feature with Windows 8, I wasn't sure if this was really needed on a laptop but Windows 8 works a lot better if you have this. Finally the number keypad is a nice touch if you are doing business work. I mean right down to the fingerprint scanner, the superior \"Beats\" audio system, this Laptop in my opinion is the best on the market. I've compared in detail with Dell and Sony who really make great machines, but just dont put the package together the way HP does. I mean the little details make the difference, on the Dell the keyboard backlight for example, its uneven across the keyboard, and its not really that bright, here it is just perfect (just like the Mac). And in terms of performance, for the money this machine packs an amazing punch, I'd really suggest 16G of RAM if you can afford it, if you are a power user you will top out and be swapping on an 8G machine. I will report back in 6mos or so on how well this one travels and if anything breaks, but, so far bravo to HP for a really nice job on this sweet machine.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Solid choice for a touchscreen laptop.", "Author": "James H.

I use a wireless mouse and the touchscreen for most things. I think my biggest problem is that I'm a fan of desktops and I replaced my ailing desktop with this.
