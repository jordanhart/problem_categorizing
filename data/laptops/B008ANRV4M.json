This computer has a fast processor, an excellent screen, adequate storage,64 bit professional operating system and much more.  If you want something totally serviceable for high school, general office tasks, and college work short of engineering or advanced video photography, it is more than adequate - even for casual gaming and watching movies.  True, it is not just off the presses and does not have the state of the art features, nor is it fully future proof.  If you can find it for a descent price and don't use it for the highest level of performance, I can highly recommend it.  Most of the cost of a premium  machine is either in weight (maybe 2-3 lbs) or in 10-20%increase in quality.  That 15% costs a lot and you should ask if you really need it.  Gaming computers again are entirely different products. I have owned this laptop for over a year and it has served me well.  Other people might legitimately rate this a four start product but for my purposes its five starts.  The Amazon criteria is 5 starts for \"I love it\" and that's the way I feel.  To be honest I just love \"think pad\" products with the little red \"thingy\".  ( I do own a graphics computer for photography and gaming but for most of the tasks of life and business, I use this one.)Note:  I did increase the ram from 2 gb to 4 gb at my local computer shop; cost about $30.00.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great guinea pig machine...nothing else.", "Author": "Tushar N. Dadarwala", "ReviewID": "R1UEP3FEIKUZES", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this laptop from an IT school.  Considering it was part of the tuition and it is supposed to be used FREQUENTLY in class especially for VMs (virtual machines) ie, Server 2003 and Server 2008.  I am very disappointed with their (the school) choice of laptop.  I eventually upgraded the 4 gb of RAM to 8GB max (cost $50).  I had also went ahead and upgraded the stock 5400rpm, 320 GB SATA HD with a crucial 512GB SSD (cost $300).  I transfered the whole OS/Drive onto the new SSD via a USB/SATA cable, worked like a charm.  Now, instead of waiting literally 5 minutes for Windows 7 to load.  The OS is up and running in 30 seconds.  For me the cost of $350 was ok, even though I had already kinda' paid for it in my tuition.  I use it as a 'test' laptop.  I will most likely try to find ways to upgrade/change the FAN and CPU (maybe to an i7).So, I would value this laptop at $400 max.  There are others out there that can be upgraded piece by piece and still be under the asking price of $600.hope this helps.", "Date": "March 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "New - Retail\n1-Year Limited Warranty\nLenovo 031946U\nLenovo ThinkPad Edge 15 031946U 15.6 LED Notebook Core i3 i3-380M 2.53GHz 2GB DDR3 320GB HDD DVD-Writer Intel HD Graphics Windows 7 Professional 64-bit Black Textured", "Name": "Lenovo ThinkPad Edge 15 031946U 15.6 LED Notebook Core i3 i3-380M 2.53GHz 2GB DDR3 320GB HDD DVD-Writer Intel HD Graphics Windows 7 Professional 64-bit Black Textured", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/419jdkHaEGL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008ANRV4M"}}
