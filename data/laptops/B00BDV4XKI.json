{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wow! What a deal!", "Author": "S. Clark", "ReviewID": "RHMEHEQHI7SR3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched and researched looking for the best machine I could get for my money and I could not be happier after purchasing the Toshiba C855-S5194.  But........I purchased it locally at a major office supply store because their 'in store' discount coupled with the $50 rebate was a better price than here.  Most of the negative reviews I'd read about *any* laptop was that Windows 8 was horrible.  Well, that has nothing to do with the performance of the laptop.  AND, Toshiba sends you a free e-copy of Windows 8 for Dummies (only 32 pages) so there's no excuse to say you don't know how to navigate.  Memory was a huge selling point for me, there's lots of it on this machine, and it had a better processor than some of the others I was looking at. I did have to change some of the settings on the touchpad because I didn't like the defaults (i.e. to scroll you have to use TWO fingers and I'd rather use one on the side or bottom).  You have to be slightly deliberate in your typing, but I'm ok with that too.  And I've really been impressed with the battery life.  I can work on it for up to four hours (maybe a little more).  The web cam is very clear and adjusts the light accordingly.  My husband and I Tango (free video chat app) and the images are good (depending on your signal).  I installed Office Home Professional without any trouble.  It's light for the size it is.  I would highly recommend this machine to anyone in the market!", "Date": "March 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome!!!!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2MPVU0EF0ADLX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been shopping for a laptop for about a month now and almost went for another HP but decided to try a Toshiba instead and so far I am completely happy with this decision. First time using Windows 8 but I am catching on quickly.. very easy to set up and super quiet. The laptop is quite fast and  quiet, and so far works for what I need. ok so the not so good things, the keyboard is ok... it feels kinda cheaply made like I may lose keys for some reason... also the sound isn't that great as well so I will end up purchasing external speakers but its ok Im not too picky about it. Also I expedited the shipping but didn't get it in a timely manner which kinda upset me a little bit as I paid extra for that and if I would have done regular shipping it would have been free and I prob would have gotten it at the same time.... I will recommend this product as a light to medium user who doesn't need to do anything extravagant like heavy gaming... thumbs up!!!", "Date": "March 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "very nice laptop", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R2MMYNM3GCD7L1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Size a litttle bigger for my taste. but is great laptop screen very nice and 6g of memory gives good performance", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "overall good experience", "Author": "suhas", "ReviewID": "R12AV6NIUDV6X1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i am glatd to buy this laptot till now its working good and met my expectationsI will shuggest to buy this good deal", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "First time buyer", "Author": "F.

The performance in video is very good, the usb transfer is faster with usb 3.0 and 2.0, copy and burn disc without problems, the panel touch is very sensitive. The laptop is not very hot in normal use: you must not block the vents under the equipment if you are using the processor at maximum performance, it is very hot. If using in a ventilated area, barely heated. Underweight, nice appearance in colour and shape. My laptop have win8: this software is still not good, have problems with external drivers for example my usb modem (gprs), but works gently with toshiba software. Before you use an older model toshiba (2004) and I had problems but now buy a new laptop (2013) and it works perfect, I recommend it. When the diagnosis of windows experience, the video card has the lowest performance and processor, the maximum performance.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Long time user of Toshiba.", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R38JNXAJT8GX7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned Toshiba computers in the past and have never had any problems.

Third month into using it, the whole screen is black, power button won't turn off.  I took it back to Staples and they ran a check, and then told me, I had to call Toshiba.  I called Toshiba and I have to return it for $24.00 to get it repaired.  I shouldn't have to pay a dime, but if I want my, supposedly brand new computer, which cost me over $400.00 computer running again, I have to fork over the money, and I am now waiting on the box for them to send me, to ship it back in!This is simply unacceptable and unbelievable.  I would never buy another Toshiba, nor would I suggest one to anyone!I will update, after I get it back, and see how it works then.(Update)  I got it back, after a week, and it is working great now.

I've spent a number of hours following different leads, but so far nothing works). Workaround is to use it with a USB mouse.It might be fine if you want to stick to Windows 8.

It was always suggested that my problems had NOTHING to do with the computer, and were always the fault of the internet provider (although other computers beside this one, and other devices performed flawlessly on the same network). I ended up finding that a lot of the other series of Toshiba laptops I had purchased indeed had some Wi-Fi problems, and that Toshiba Customer Service has been transferred to the Philippines, thus answering why it took twice as long to learn that the tech had no actual knowledge of the computer due to a language barrier.I only hope that THIS Toshiba is free of Wi-Fi problems, and that I don't EVER have to deal with Toshiba C/S again.I WON'T buy another Toshiba.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very weak in internet uses", "Author": "Marks Ford", "ReviewID": "R2ZYWAB6J7PHJY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really thought that this laptop would work well with my simple needs.
