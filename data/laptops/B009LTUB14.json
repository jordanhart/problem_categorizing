Not a month of use, and the motherboard is dead. It can't identify a boot device. Been on chat with a (friendly, thank goodness) Dell rep who is sending a tech to replace the motherboard. I hope this is a one-time problem. My previous Dells have fared far better...UPDATE: A couple of months have passed since the comment above and I'm less frustrated with this computer. Dell actually did the right thing and sent a tech to look at and fix the laptop. He replaced the motherboard and everything is working okay now. The tech met me at work and fixed the computer before the end of my day, so it was very convenient. Well done Dell, I'm pleasantly surprised. Now I just hope the computer keeps working (it's great when it does...)", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "would not boot after just a few weeks, returned to Amazon", "Author": "PaulC", "ReviewID": "R1SLBV8NV2JNB5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop looked good out at first. It is definitely not a high end product, but then one would not expect this at this price. Things got bad after just a few weeks though as it would no longer boot. I tried to resolve the issue with Dell technical support, but this took so long to do that I returned the product for a replacement as suggested by Amazon. Great service from Amazon, and poor show from Dell. I am told the issue is due to an incompatibility issue between the Windows 8 updates (which the machine downloads automatically once switched on) and the hardware. I am ordering a second laptop like this one an hope to have more luck with it next time.Update: despite having been sourced from a different supplier, the second laptop failed after just a few days and would not boot. Exactly the same problem as with the first laptop. I tried to resolve the issue with Dell technical support, but this proved to be really frustrating. The technical centre is based in India and the telephone line kept dropping. I had to call 5 times, which was really infuriating because I had to start from scratch each time (warranty code, laptop model, my name, description of the problem, etc). Very disappointingly, Dell could not fix the problem over the phone, and  wanted the product returned to them for servicing - this would have taken weeks. It was much easier and quicker to return the laptop to Amazon for a refund. Not impressed at all by Dell, I think there are better choices. Do not buy this product.I have heard of others complaining about the technical support from Dell. It is obvious the staff in the technical support centre are not technical at all, they are just people working to a script. I think they are doing the best job they can, but the support they can offer is limited, and the script makes the whole process very time consuming and cumbersome, especially if like me you had to call back 5 times because the call dropped. I spent over 1 hour on the phone dealing with the first laptop, and well over 2 hours dealing with the second one. Might have been OK if they had offered a resolution, but they did not, so I had to return both laptops anyway.", "Date": "June 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wish that it would work", "Author": "jamesdevins", "ReviewID": "RU6622YNVTPLD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros: price, seem very well built, keyboard, size/convience. When it was working, it was fast and ran very smooth.The Issues: After about 4 weeks it would not boot. I sent it off to Dell service center and they needed to replace the motherboard, hard drive, audio board and reinstall Windows 8. Not sure what the exact issue was and Dell support has been somewhat vague. When the laptop was returned an administrator profile was setup and it would not allow me to create a profile. I was on the phone with tech support for over an hour for them to tell me the OS needs reset/put back on the computer properly (not sure why this was not fixed properly before sending back to me). Anyway they want me to buy an external disk drive and install Windows 8 again.Overall I'm very pleased with the build of the laptop and wish that it would work.UPDATE: I sent the laptop back and was given a refund. I do not recommend buying this laptop because of the 4 weeks issues (will not boot). I have found several other reviews stating the same issues as mine. It appears Dell's quality has lowered.

I purchased it and 2 months later it wouldn't recognize any of the components - no wireless, no pointing device.  I got on the phone with Dell technical support for over 1 1/2 hours.  They said the hard drive failed and would send out a technician with a new hard drive to install.  Two days later that happened.After installing the hard drive, the technician said to wait for the computer to reboot and install the programs.  24 hours later, it said it was still installing the programs on the screen.Called Dell again and was on the phone again for another hour with them having me run all kinds of diagnostic tests.  Clearly they didn't know what the problem was and said they would be sending me something in the mail to install.They ended up sending CD's.  My computer does not have a CD!!  They should have checked the computer configuration to determine if I had a CD or not.  That wasted another 3 days.Got on the phone AGAIN with technical support - for over 1 1/2 hours.  Still more testing, more questions.  They said they would be sending out something else to me.  Anticipating it would take another 2 days to receive, I asked to be transferred to their supervisor.  Another 35 minutes and she couldn't do anything.  I asked for a replacement and she said she couldn't authorize it.I said I didn't want to do any more testing, diagnosing, installation of things.... I need the issue resolved and nobody can tell me what is wrong.  She said she would send this to an escalation team who would get back to me in up to 48 hours.Seriously - I just can't believe the computer failed after 2 months and I can't get the thing fixed. It sounds like a lot of other people had the same problem so just be aware when purchasing this product.  I have no idea if it is another hardware piece like the motherboard or something else.

Much to my amazement, their customer service and technical support was absolutely first rate, correcting a flaw in the battery and conducting extensive tests to ensure that this laptop performed as good as new; I am also grateful to them for giving me a year's warranty on this laptop despite the fact that I had purchased it second-hand from Amazon's Warehouse Outlet. As for the unit itself, I am especially impressed with how quickly it loads web pages, due no doubt to having 6 MB of RAM. Despite its relatively slow 1.4 Ghz speed, it has performed nearly as fast as an older Dell XPS M1330 which I still use daily; that older Dell has a 2.2 Ghz speed. This is almost the perfect laptop for web searching. My only reservation is that it seems to be less durable in construction than the Dell XPS M1330 or some other Dell laptops that I still use.

To be honest I bought this unit after working for a couple months with a Samsung Chromebook. I love the Chromebooks and I love the idea of cloud computing, but there were a handful of tasks that I needed to have a full-fledged Windows PC to complete. My original thought was to blow off Windows 8 as soon as this laptop arrived and to load Windows 7. But it came at the same time as the Windows 8.1 update so I decided to give it a try. Since that time I have found a way to COMPLETELY eliminate the Windows Metro interface from ever coming up, and for all intents and purposes this OS now works almost identical to Win7. The Inspiron 5323 is a decent little laptop and I love the size. Sure it could be a bit snappier, but I didn't get it for heavy lifting...just basic business applications and some photo, audio and video editing. I've owned it for about 3 weeks now and everything seems to be working great. If I had one complaint it would be the incredibly frustrating covers on the side ports.
