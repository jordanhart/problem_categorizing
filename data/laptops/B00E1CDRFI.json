Wow Touchscreen is awesome", "Author": "Kevin", "ReviewID": "R2YTL5ZHSIDLQH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is replacing my HP Laptop that is 5 years old. Although I am not fond ofWindows 8 the touchscreen was a must to me. The HD display is everything itis supposed to be. The only complaint is the flexibility of the left side of the keyboard, but I can live with that for a trade off.Windows 8 is going to release 8.1 in October and I believe it will be an update. This will no doubt improvefunctionality of windows 8. Like a start button and booting into desktop mode.
