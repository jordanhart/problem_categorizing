{"Reviews": [{"Title": "IBM ThinkPad T43 - it is well worth every penny!", "Author": "david", "ReviewID": "R24AQFS24P82GI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "T43 ThinkPad, the last year for them is 12/2005 - but, the BIOS through IBM website can be upgraded to 2009 or version 1.29 which gives ability to go beyond the 60 gb barrier. It also makes it a bit faster. can also run the faster 667hz ram.I have been running Linux Mint 14 in my T43 for almost a year and love it! With the 9 cell, I can get a it over 3.5 hours.Changing the hard drive is easy as pie! with One restart can be using another hard drive with a different OS on it.Adding Ram, there is one slot UNDER the keyboard and the other on the back,The Ultra Bay will use a 320Gb hard drive and is Hot Swappable. Pull out hard drive, slide in CD drive, pull it out and put in a IonLithium battery which gives about 2 hours more. Without need of doing a restart/reboot. And Linux will recognize this function. The UltraBay is the newer style drive (not ide).I have the 15 inch which has 128 mb video - superb and am extremely happy with the IBM. I had a Compaq before this laptop. Wow! what a difference!Mine is a Off lease laptop. The WIFI works so well, don't need the slot in the left side, I have put in a WiFi Netgear card, but the built int IBM WiFi in the monitor is so good, it actually works better. Linux recognizes it automatically.I find it easier to just plug in USB printer than use wireless. I've had mine for about a year and want another just cause.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000SOEFEK"}}
