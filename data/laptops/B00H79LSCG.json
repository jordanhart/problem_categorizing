Pool", "ReviewID": "R2MR9C7H0DVT6Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When I needed a computer for school I was a little apprehensive. I thought I would buy a Chromebook for the cost however I am very pleased i went in for a little more power.First off the big thing on this machine that will get some looks is the hard drive. It only has 126GB. For a laptop in today's world that is a little light--however it is not a gaming laptop that needs tons of memory.What this is however is the meanest little web surfer and office utility computer I have ever had. With 16GB of RAM you would be hard pressed to confuse or slow down this computer with normal use. Also it is solid state so my battery life, shut down/start up, and install speeds are all phenomenal.And that said, I use Blender for 3D modeling and it runs it like a champ. I am actually going to start using this over my 'gaming rig' for my game development projects.It is very thin, light, and sturdy. I don't trust carrying it around too much without a slip case. I should have bought one when I got it but alwell. It is deceivingly tough though for how small it is.Other great things about this laptop is the keyboard. Lots of laptops have pretty small keyboards. Having large hands this presents a problem typing out long grad school papers. Not the HP ProBook, it has a great full size board, spaced out keys, and it has a lovely action to the keys. I wouldn't say it is mechanical-ish but you feel a satisfying bounce to each stroke without any annoying clapping of clicking.The display does seem a little dim. You can make it out in full sunlight but it isn't super impressive. However the resolution is amazing. The first thing I did, while downloading Steam, was to watch Netflix. It has a crystal clear display.One bad thing (I guess) is that it does come with HP's programs that are hard coded to the recovery disk. So if you are a purist you may have to blow away the OS and start over. I am flaky about choosing a Anti-Virus though so I don't mind HP coming with some built in.Other cool features: you can unlock it with your finger, you can connect your phone to it through bluetooth, you can (supposedly but not fully tested) work with a smart TV through it, and the keyboard is spill resistant!Soooo---I might be a little too excited for this laptop but I think it is worth the money and really doesn't have any huge issues that I have hit. My laptop did have a defective key (bent keyboard spring) but I was able to get a replacement very quickly at no charge that works great.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "fast and light", "Author": "Laura Thulesen", "ReviewID": "R3IAC788XMIXLV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I highly recommend this computer.  I have been using a laptop significantly heavier and without the solid state drive.  This one runs faster and cooler and I love the difference in weight.  This is an expensive computer but I loved the choices on big RAM and the SS drive.  It's not a big hard drive, which makes me not love it (I have lots and lots of music and pictures I like to keep on my HD all the time, as well as big files).  Also, the other reason I didn't mark \"love it\" is because it has an issue that if you pick it up on the left bottom while its in use and squeeze it (which you do when transporting it to another room), I have twice had the screen go to static and buzz.  It has to be forced to restart but then seems fine upon startup.  Great computer overall!", "Date": "February 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Solid Laptop - Value for money", "Author": "AD", "ReviewID": "RM6TSURT5X0LR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Awesome Laptop.

It looks sleek. The only thing to keep in mind is that you may want to uninstall some of the HP software when you receive the laptop so that it doesn't drag the performance. I've used Lenovo and Acer in the past, and this HP laptop is far faster and sleeker. Just what I was looking for, five stars for HP.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Light and fast", "Author": "mcmanuspop \"Bobby D\"", "ReviewID": "RHZRO7DUDR77A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was initially worried the i3 4010u processor would be slow.
