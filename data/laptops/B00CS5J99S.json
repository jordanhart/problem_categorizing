Documentation is Italian; but the English manual is readily googled, found, and downloaded. Keyboard has Euro markings; but the software interprets it as if it were American. If this bugs you, there are lots of inexpensive replacement keyboards available; and installation looks pretty easy. Finally, if you want to store lots of videos, 16GB may run out; although, to be fair, the SDHC card slot offers virtually unlimited memory expansion.With these issues, why am I happy with it? Easy. It is compact, light, built like a tank, and (most important) it has a solid-state hard drive. Nothing else (that I know of) meets these needs at anything like the price of the 901.Also, FYI, it runs Ubuntu Linux just fine. It's doing that right now.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CS5J99S"}}
