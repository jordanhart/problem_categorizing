Dent \"Aragorn\"", "ReviewID": "R376ZG1356KO6Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HP's Chromebook 11 is my second Chromebook because, after one year with Samsung's Chromebook I came to realize that not only a Chromebook does almost everything a laptop or a PC or a tablet would do for me but it does it cheaper, usually faster and better, almost always worry-free and very much in style._____________________________________________________UPDATE (Dec 26, 2013): I am glad to see HP's 11-inch Chromebook available again. We've been using ours all throughout the charger 'crisis' and we are as happy with it today if not happier than we were on 'day one'. More than two months later, HP's Chromebook 11 continues to be a beautiful little device with a great display that continues to do most of what I require during my off-work hours. It traveled with me on my vacation and will travel with me again and it's there (on couch or on my bedside table) when I need it._____________________________________________________WHY A CHROMEBOOK?There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about an 'under 300' device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do better most of the time.\u02d5 My Chromebook is my most used computer excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.\u02d5 Malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on the Chromebook, I can't see how one would ever be infected. I am now using my Chromebook to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs that I don't dare touch from a laptop.\u02d5 Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chromium wasn't cracked yet.\u02d5 Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment.\u02d5 Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chromium every few weeks and I found my Chromebook actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence. HP's Chromebook will not replace Samsung's, it will be used by another family member who really, really wanted one after watching my happy relationship with our first one.\u02d5 Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy for a while once I turn them back on. Tablets, especially, are almost impossible to use until all those dozens of updates/upgrades process. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.\u02d5 The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.\u02d5 Chromium is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.\u02d5 Chromium being such a streamlined OS, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is in fact faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.\u02d5 Relatively low prince, 11.6\" display and light weight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.WHY NOT A CHROMEBOOK?Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, they are mainly and they are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video or perform some heavy word processing or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.HP's CHROMEBOOK 11I haven't spent a lot of time with HP's but, from the start, it was a very familiar feeling. HPs is not 'exactly like' Samsung's but it's easily recognizable as a Chromebook.Here are some changes:\u02d5 USB-based charging. This is a BIG thing. The biggest negative in the case of Samsung's Chromebook was the proprietary charger. HP's USB-based charging allows the use of most off-the-shelf chargers so there's a lot less to worry.\u02d5 Better quality display. When compared to Samsung's the colors are sharper and brighter and you can view the screen from almost any angle left/right or up/down.\u02d5 Nicer keyboard. It's the same layout but the keys seem to have a little more travel. As a touch typist I am comfortable with both but, on a blind test, I would probably pick HP's over Samsung's.\u02d5 Somewhat more stylish design. I got the black model and I like both the color and the color accents. Some prefer 'silver' but they are both Okay as far as I can tell.\u02d5 Fewer ports. There are no USB 3.0 or HDMI ports on the HP's even though my understanding is that you can, in fact output HDMI through the Micro USB. This may be a big deal for some and they should get Samsung's if that's the case. Speaking for myself, I never felt a need to output HDMI off my Chromebook, ever. Same for USB data transfers.Overall, I am very pleased with HPs device. The lack of USB 3.0 and HDMI ports amount to a big 'nothing' to me and their absence is balanced and surpassed by the non-proprietary charging method, much nicer display and better keyboard.RATINGI am not going to compare HP's Chromebook with the Pixel or some top of the line laptop. I noticed that many 'pro' reviewers are complaining because Chromebooks and this particular one are not 'high end' and aren't as nice as the Pixel and such. Well... did anyone check the prices? So, yes, let me make a 'duh' statement: this Chromebook is not as good as devices that sell for 3 times or 4 times as much so anyone who doesn't mind paying more should pay more and get one of those. Even though... look at some reasons above for why one my prefer a Chromebook to a laptop or a tablet, regardless of price.HPs is a five-star to me because it's at least as good and in some way better than my now one year old, often used and much trusted Samsung. The thirty dollars price difference between the two can be justified by HP's supporting USB charging, its much nicer display and its marginally better keyboard. As far as performance, they both appear to be up to the task and they both played Netflix movies flawlessly over Wi-Fi and cast them to the big TV through Chromecast (no need of an HDMI cable for that) - I mention it because I just tried that.Chromebooks are not for everyone and they are not a universal computing device but, if used for what they are meant to be used, they are as good and as revolutionary as tablets._____________________________________________________CHROMEBOOK vs. CHROMEBOOK (HPs vs. Acer C720I had the opportunity to play with Acer's Chromebook for a day and was therefore able to compare them side by side.- Advantage HP -\u02d5 Looks and design. HPs looks much better in my view, you have color choices and that's that.\u02d5 Display. Same size, same resolution but HPs display is brighter, sharper and, most importantly, can be viewed from almost any angle. Not the case with Acer's.\u02d5 Charging. The ability to charge HPs Chromebook through almost any USB charger is very important to me. Acer's charger is proprietary.- Advantage Acer -\u02d5 Horsepower. Acer's appears to be faster and it should be given its faster processor.\u02d5 Ports. You get HDMI out, USB 3.0 and SD card slot, all of them missing on HP's machine.\u02d5 Price. At least at launch, Acer's was selling for less.I would say it's a tie when it comes to the keyboard and track pad's feel.Acer's machine has the advantage if you are more 'productivity oriented' and need expansion capabilities (ports) and more raw CPU power. You would prefer the HP if you want a Chromebook mainly for fun and casual activities where looks, the availability of a charger and, very importantly, the quality of the display count more._____________________________________________________NOTES:- Like most Chromebooks, this one too comes with a free 100GB in Google's cloud for two years. I didn't take advantage of that offer and I'm not going to go for this one, simply because I have no use of 'cloud' storage that goes beyond Gmail at this time.- While Chromebooks are immune to viruses and other forms of malware, you are as tracked and 'monetized' while on a Chromebook as you are when browsing from your laptop or tablet or phone. However, there are ways to disrupt and confuse the trackers and my two favorite extensions these days are Disconnect Search (or Disconnect.me) that makes it impossible for Google to log your search activities and DoNotTrackMe which does what the name implies.

It is super thin and light and extremely beautiful. It is so practical that I can charge this laptop with the same charger of my smartphone and the other way around. This is the best laptop on the go.The screen is very sharp, bright and high quality. Keyboard feels great when typing, speakers sound comes from the keyboard which makes this Chromebook completely sealed. There's no holes, moving parts, or anything that makes any noise.Chrome OS has had a lot of improvements since last year. There a lot of offline apps, better notifications and a lot of awesome extensions. Free Google Drive 100Gb is still awesome.I want to acknowledge that this is not a high performance laptop and is not suitable for high demanding 3D gamers. But for the price you will be fully satisfied because obviously this Chromebook has a really affordable price and is very pretty and performs almost all the task a regular computer does(and some extras that traditional computers doesn't).One thing worth mention that this computer excels is Sound. Speakers are very rich, precise, loud and clear. Music lovers will enjoy the clarity of the music. You can really enjoy watching a movie due to the richness of the image and the quality of the sound...I love this Chromebook because it just do the job well done!Any questions please feel free to ask it in the comments below section...", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect...", "Author": "Deron Dantzler", "ReviewID": "R2Z7PWRX2D8D72", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am an IT professional (web/application developer), and I must say that I love this new Chromebook. I purchased a Samsung 11 inch Chromebook 4 months ago and have been using it as my primary home machine ever since. The Samsung was great, but the screen was the Achilles heel. I can say that this screen is the same approximate quality of an 11 inch MacBook Air. I can't make out an advantage between the two screens. That is awesome for this price. The design is perfect, and the speakers sound great for a small laptop.It's my opinion that tablets are great for surfing the Internet and reading, but even though you may add a keyboard they are basically useless for productivity. Multi-tasking is the downfall for those devices and it really needs to get sorted out. The Chromebook is more like a tablet in a laptop disguise, and \"multi-tasks\" well. Of course it's running one core application (Chrome), but you can use multiple windows, etc. That's very helpful when copying and pasting content, and using productivity applications. For the general public that likes to surf the net, work with documents, write e-mails, etc. this is a highly recommended machine. Work can be done on the device. I also teach college courses both online and brick and mortar, and this device has been my go-to machine for grading, interacting with students, etc. That goes to show the power of the device for the typical office user. It works for advanced users like me if you take it for what it is... A damn quality piece of hardware for the price that offers a far more robust productivity experience than any competitively priced tablet.If your curious, my usage pattern for technology has now evolved to: Smartphone, Small tablet, Chromebook. No need for a large tablet. Small tablet is primarily for bed and couch surfing and using as an e-reader. Smartphone is my main on the go unit. Chromebook is my primary computer. When I'm at work, I primarily use my corporate PC. My wife's primary computer is a MacBook, so if there's a time when I need to do something more intense (on rare occasions I need to do some web graphical interface design at home) then I use her MacBook or Remote Desktop on the Chromebook to my corporate machine.If you're on the fence, I say give it a shot.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "The next generation of Chromebooks - A complete review", "Author": "Cenile D. Mentia", "ReviewID": "RRNOVC1BM8BMD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "==UPDATE 12/26/13== Well, the HP Chromebook is back on the shelves after the whole issue with the chargers overheating. After a couple months with this Chromebook and the other model, I still say the Acer Chromebook is a better value--but for those who don't multitask as often and just prefer a well designed laptop for a low price (it does look good!), this is probably the best model for you.This is getting to be a long review, so I've split it up into multiple sections. Feel free to jump to the section which you think will help you the most.==CONTENTS==1) Upgrades from last year2) Alternative models3) First impressions4) Conclusion5) SummaryI'll be updating this review as I use the Chromebook more often as well, so check back once in a while! As always, feel free to ask questions in the comments section, and I'll be happy to answer them.==UPGRADES FROM LAST YEAR==In 2012, with the Samsung Chromebook becoming the #1 best selling laptop on Amazon, it seemed like there was hope after all for the Chromebooks. It was something that not many people expected, but the thin, silent design, combined with a decent battery life and a low price point managed to attract enough people to give Chromebooks a chance.One year later, the time has come for its successor--the HP Chromebook 11. Is it a worthy successor? This review will take a closer look at what changed over the last year as well as explore some of the alternative options.Let's start with the hardware. The design of this Chromebook is completely different compared to Samsung's model from last year. This is partially because it's made by HP, but also because Google teamed up with HP to design this new Chromebook. There's two color choices now, black and white. If you pick the white version, you also have the option to add Google-colored accents to the edges of the keyboard, while the black version is more understated, with an all black finish. Whether you like the new design or not is subjective, but it does retain the thinness (.69 inches) and is actually .1 pounds lighter than the previous Samsung model. There's also a new LED light bar on the back, similar to the Pixel. It lights up with the Google colors when it's on, and it looks pretty nice. Personally, I think it's a well designed laptop. It's simple, lightweight, and the unsightly bump from last year's model is gone.The keyboard and touchpad are still extremely good. It's comfortable to type on, and overall has a much sturdier feel due to a new magnesium frame that they put in to support the plastic shell. There were some complaints about the Samsung model from last year regarding how flimsy it felt and how easy it was to bend it, and they definitely improved it here. Also, they've moved the speakers to underneath the keyboard, similar to how Apple does it. This way, the speakers do not get muffled when you put the notebook on your laps. Speaker quality is actually pretty decent for a sub-$300 laptop, but headphones are still going to be the obvious first choice for audiophiles.Another major improvement is the screen. Google's making a big deal about the brightness of the new screen, but it truly is better than last year's model. Though it retains the same 1366x768 resolution (which is fine for a 11 inch laptop), the viewing angles and the contrast is much better. It is a glossy screen though, so unless you absolutely loved the more matte feel of last year's model, then the screen's also a big improvement.The best hardware improvement for me personally is the new power port. It's now charged through a Micro USB cable, a cable that's currently used to charge most Android phones as well as the Amazon Kindles. As someone who travels a lot, this would mean just packing one cable to charge all my devices, something that I think adds a lot of convenience. Another advantage is that the abundance of Micro USB cables makes it easy to find a replacement should you ever lose it(you probably have one lying around in your house!). Note that it does charge slower if you use another cable: the one that comes with this Chromebook has been optimized for it. With that being said, the HP Chromebook 11 does lose the HDMI port found in the previous model, but it's still possible to connect it to your TV. To do so, you'd have to buy a Slimport adapter and then connect the HDMI cable from there. It's not a big hassle, but it's still something worth mentioning.All of these changes mentioned above have been mostly good and welcomed improvements to last year's model, but perhaps it's the parts that haven't changed which are the most disappointing. Unfortunately, Google has decided to not upgrade any of the internal aspects of the Chromebook, so it still retains the same ARM based processor found last year's model, the 16GB of flash storage, and the 2GB of RAM. Battery life remains more or less the same as well, at around 6 hours. Considering the brisk pace technology moves at, I think it's hugely disappointing that Google is still using last year's chips, and it's the one major flaw with this Chromebook. One of the biggest changes in technology this year was the introduction of Intel's 4th generation Haswell processors, giving solid processing power while drastically increasing power efficiency. The new Macbooks are using it, and some of the new Chromebooks are too, increasing their battery life to around 9 hours per charge. One might argue that Chromebooks don't require much processing power, but with websites and web apps becoming more advanced every day, I think it's disappointing that none of the internal hardware was upgraded. Note that overall performance isn't bad, but it's not great either. It's the exact same as last year's model - most websites I tried run smoothly, but some of the more graphically heavy websites stutter when you're trying to scroll. HD video playback is relatively steady, but if you have too many tabs open, the quality suffers. For the pages most people visit, like Facebook, Youtube, Gmail, etc., I thought this Chromebook handled it pretty well as long as I didn't have too many tabs open.In regards to the software, this is still running Chrome OS, and if you used any of the Chromebooks before, you'd be familiar with it's capabilities and limitations. There's no real changes here, since all Chromebooks are continuously updated with the most recent version of Chrome OS, but for those looking at the Chromebooks for the first time, here's a little rundown on how the Chrome operating system works. At its core, it's the Chrome web browser, and only the Chrome web browser. Though the pictures in the advertisements shows a desktop and wallpaper, don't be fooled: it's not a traditional PC. Therefore, if you use programs like Microsoft Office, Photoshop, iTunes, etc., know that you won't be able to use any of those programs on a Chromebook. However, there are substitutes for most of those programs online, such as Google Docs, Picasa, Google Music, etc. The advantage of having such a simple system is speed: it boots up in less than 10 seconds, and you're instantly connected to the web (provided you have Wi-Fi). Therefore, if most of what you do on a computer is browse the web anyways (Facebook, E-mail, Youtube, etc.), then a Chromebook allows you to do all of that very quickly.Overall, this Chromebook is definitely an improvement over last year's Samsung model, but the lack of internal changes makes it really hard to recommend if you're looking to upgrade from the Samsung model. For people looking into Chromebooks for the first time, I'd say that this isn't a bad model - it's relatively cheap at $279, it's well designed, and it's overall performance is still solid. For people looking for a \"cute\" second computer, I do think this is a great model. However, I'd still recommend giving the other models announced this year a look (see below).==ALTERNATIVE MODELS==Even though this is Google's new flagship Chromebook - the one they're promoting as the Chromebook \"for everyone\", there are other options coming out.Acer's C720 Chromebook (Acer C720 Chromebook (11.6-Inch, Haswell micro-architecture, 4GB))I've been using this model for the last couple days and I must say I prefer this model over the Hp model. It's just so much zippier: websites load faster, scrolling is more responsive, and it handles multiple tabs better. It also has better battery life and more input/output ports. Sure the screen isn't as good, but it's not terrible either. Unless you really desire an attention-catching device, I'd recommend the Acer Chromebook over this model. I've written a full review for the Acer, so feel free to read it for a closer look.HP's Chromebook 14 (HP Chromebook 14 (Snow White))HP announced this as an update to last year's 14 inch model, which was moderately successful. They've completely redesigned it, and I think it looks much more elegant. It'll come in multiple colors for $299. It'll also include the new Haswell processors, giving it a 9-hour battery life. I think this is a great model for those who want a larger screen and do not mind the increased weight.Additional notes:Google also packages this Chromebook 11 with some extra perks, including 12 sessions of GoGo In-flight Wi-Fi, as well as 100GB of Google Drive storage for 2 years. If you are a frequent flyer, those 12 sessions alone makes the Chromebook pretty cost-efficient. I'm not certain if the other Chromebook models include the GoGo WiFi, but they all include the Google Drive storage. Also something worth mentioning is that this HP Chromebook 11 model is fanless due to its processor, so it's absolutely silent. The other models do have fans, but in my opinion, the sound difference is negligible.==FIRST IMPRESSIONS==When I first heard about this Chromebook, I was pretty excited. I looked at a bunch of pictures, saw the price tag, and I thought to myself, \"Now here's the Chromebook I've been waiting for\". Prior to this, I've used the Samsung Chromebook S3 as well as the original CR-48 Chromebook test model, mainly for taking notes in class. After opening the box and turning it on for the first time, I was ecstatic, because to be honest, this screen looked great, especially compared to the older models. The Chromebook in general looked great. I loved the color bar in the back, the clean design, and the keyboard. It was light and portable, and it looked very...attractive (as attractive as a computer can be I suppose). Setting it up was easy as well: you connect to your Wi-Fi, enter in your Google credentials, and then it syncs with your Google account, and all your bookmarks and apps are automatically transferred over. Anyone who's used a Chromebook before would be used to this.Bringing it to class was also a pleasure. It fits into one of my smaller bags, and it was light enough to be comfortable to carry. I thought the keyboard and trackpad were pretty awesome - they remind me of the Apple's keyboard, and I think that's a pretty high compliment. I'm a fast touch typist, and I was able to maintain my normal WPM with few errors while taking notes. Midway through the day though, I was working on a research project and had a bunch of tabs open and the Chromebook began to feel a bit slow: pages were loading slower and the scrolling wasn't as smooth. I attribute to the fact that Google decided to use last year's chips as I mentioned in the section above, as this was something that would happen with the Samsung model as well. This was frustrating for me, because I thought surely by now, Chrome would run smoothly on Chrome OS. This is the sole reason I'm giving this model 3 stars. I got around 5.5 hours of battery life, so that's a bit less than advertised. Nevertheless, I did find the charging cable useful, and I was able to use it to charge both my phone and the computer.==CONCLUSION==With this year's updates, I'm sure Chromebooks will continue to be a rising star. This model, looks especially good. It's one of the best looking laptops that I've seen at this price point, and really raises the bar for low-end Chromebooks. However, if looks aren't everything for you, some of the other models equipped with the Haswell processors are especially worth looking into. While this HP Chromebook 11 is well designed - the screen is great, the speakers are decent, the keyboard is great - I'm slightly concerned about it's performance.When someone buys a laptop, they expect it to last them at least a couple of years, and I'm not sure how long a computer with a chip from the previous generation will be able to keep up.==SUMMARY==The Good:- Great screen- Great keyboard- Great sound for a sub-$300 laptop- Overall design is eye catchingThe Bad:- The processor is outdated, leading to sluggish performance at times- Cannot be taken apart, parts are hard to replace (Cannot increase RAM for example)- Less ports compared to previous generations- Battery life is good compared to last year's models, but only mediocre compared to this year's models.Overall:The HP Chromebook 11, with its solid keyboard and fantastic screen, allows you to get some serious work done -- and look good while doing it. If you can deal with a mediocre processor and battery life (and of course, Chrome OS), this is a great model. Otherwise, look elsewhere.Score: 3.5/5", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "A PERFECT device if you know what you're getting", "Author": "Ozzy", "ReviewID": "RIYRFADTZ5WIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First and foremost, if you're looking for something to use as your primary device, go look at something else.

Was a little sad Best Buy only had it in White/Blue; since I wanted White/Green.The good:  - A gorgeous 11.6\" HD screen.  - Long battery life.  - Keyboard is AWESOME.  - MicroUSB charging and MyDP/Slimport port.The bad:  - Performance is limited.  - Only USB 2.0 slots.The screen is one of the best laptop screens I've seen. Much more like your typical $400 to $600 tablet and unlike most laptops. In fact, I have seen much worse screens on $1500 laptops!Battery life tends to be long enough that I don't worry. I often see estimates of between 3 and 4 hours and can easily get over 6. Hooked up to a monitor and mouse, I can almost get through a workday with it, using the Chromebook as a Secure Shell (SSH) terminal.Keyboard is something to write home about. If you do a lot of typing, which for me, is 12 to 16 hours a day computer use. You will really appreciate this keyboard and wish you could steal it for other products, lol. This is the kinda laptop you want to use the original keyboard because it is just so good -- rather that dock, slap the lid, and move on.Along with the screen, one reason I chose this over the Samsung model, is the MicroUSB charging. It charges the same way that a standard compliant phone does; read virtually everything in the last several years without an Apple logo. The supplied charger is also a 3A, which is two the three times or more than typical phone chargers. If you use a Slimport / MyDP adapter you can hook it up to a monitor pretty easy too. Works kinda like MHL on a phone, except being DisplayPort based, it works well with VGA/D-SUB, DVI, and HDMI displays; where as MHL goes down hill if your monitor lacks HDMI.The devices processor is the real let down and only strong negative. If you are a regular user, it will likely be fine. For regular web surfing it is perfectly fine. What chokes it is heavy lifting: things like Evernote and Google Plus. Having many Chrome extensions in the background will basically give you a 22~25 second load time on Google+ (2013). I found that removing the Google Voice, Hangouts, and Google Cast extensions really helped. Without any extensions loaded the performance of loading Google+ and Gmail is more like the Celeron 847 based Chromebooks. Google+ can load in under 10 seconds that way. On the upside however thanks to the processor, the battery life is awesome and doesn't go down hill so fast, like every Core i5 machine I've used in the 'Bridge family. Trying to do audio playback and opening a lot of tabs can cause stutters in the output sometimes. That seems to be when the processor cranks up and runs out of headroom, not from having 2GB of RAM.As a consequence of the Exynos 5 Dual SoC, we only get support for USB 2. I would personally like USB 3.0 ports but frankly, for a Chromebook and the price, I can live with that ^_^.If you have any issues with performance, wait for a newer version. A Snapdragon 800 or Exynos 5 Octa design would be a nice upgrade; be it either 2GB or 3GB RAM. I think a more powerful SoC would have been a better deal for this price vs the Samsung mode.

When plugged in to the charger, no lights, no life. I did some research and read about the (old) charger problems but we have the newer, square charger. I looked for a replacement charger online, but couldn't find anything. Then I looked on HP's site and couldn't find anything. I eventually called Google and got a very nice (really) young man who was more than willing to work with me. We plugged it into a 2 AMP smartphone charge with no luck. We tried a cold reset with no luck. He escalated to tier-2 support and I worked with another nice young man. We went through several iterations until he said they're going to send us a new Chromebook (and charger). Great!

He couldn't tell me when it would be available. It's now a week later and so I emailed him for an update. He said he still doesn't know, but if it takes longer than 30 days to please let him know. 30 DAYS!!??!! It didn't even LAST 30 DAYS!!! Guess what prompted me to write my review? Buyers beware.************************Update: May 23, 2014After not receiving our replacement even after several weeks, I started turning to social media. I posted a review on HP's site and their site admin wrote me back saying they would look into the issue and see if they could help. I received a replacement within 48 hours of that post. It's now been a couple of weeks and we're starting to see charger issues again, with the plug having to be plugged in \"just right\" for it to take a charge. I don't have high hopes for the replacement at this point, but we'll have to wait and see. Having read the most recent reviews, it appears IMHO this particular piece of HP engineering is suffering from a design and/or supplier problem.************************Update: May 30, 2014HP Chromebook 11 #2 is now dead after ~2 weeks, again due to charging issues. We've tried 3 different micro-USB chargers to no avail. The Chromebook charger itself seems to be okay, as it will charge at least a couple of cell phones, but the Chromebook won't work. We've also found that while plugged in, the Chromebook will sometimes suddenly turn off, and that also often happens when unplugging it. Seems like there is likely a short in the charging socket.I called Google again and opened a new case. I have to give them props for courtesy and speaking English as their native language, but once again we're in a holding pattern to receive a replacement.

As a college student, I didn't want to spend too much money replacing my broken laptop. At $279, this HP Chromebook is a steal.What I use it for:1. Web-browsing.- Extremely fast, can have multiple tabs open at once with no lag.2. Writing papers (Google docs).- No problems with the keyboard. Easy to type and very smooth.3. Making powerpoints (Google presentation), (Google) Spreadsheets.4. Watching movies/TV (Netflix, Amazon Prime, AVI files from USB, etc.)- The screen is just as good as my Macbook Pro's was. Perfect video quality.After my laptop broke, in an effort to replace it, I bought a tablet that was almost $200 more than this Chromebook, and returned it out of disappointment. After 2 weeks with this Chromebook, nothing with it has been a disappointment. I am pretty tech savvy but by no means a \"tech nerd,\" and I would highly recommend this Chromebook, whether you are on a budget or not.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the money, a great deal for devotees to Google", "Author": "TobycW", "ReviewID": "R2LAN6P3XPPLA2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will admit, my loyalty to google started with the search engine, solidified with Gmail and the Chrome browser, and went totally all-in with Android.  In this context, let me say that I love the Chromebook 11, my first Chromebook, after owning it for just 2 days.I have put it through it's paces and have to say it is a great alternative to tablets for those prefering the traditional laptop form factor.Points of discussion:1-portability.  The Chromebook 11 is the perfect size, weight and thickness for travel.  Basically a little thicker and heavier than most 10\" tablets but not by much.2-charger.  Using a micro-usb charger is a stroke of genius.  Rated at 3A, it will charge my Chromebook, my smartphone and my tablet.  Huge plus in my book.  Certainly better than the power brick most Win laptops come with and many tablets have.3-screen.  This screen compares favorably to my original Nexus 7.  It is bright with good viewing angle.  It is my better than my full size Gateway laptop, and it is what I consider a \"premium\" display.  Bright, colorful, sharp.4-sound.  Every laptop I've used suffered in sound quality and volume.  The Chromebook has passable sound quality but is much louder from the fact that sound emanates through the keyboard.  Plenty loud for my purposes.  A negative is that sound stutters if the processor is taxed.  Unfortunately, this includes any sort of web browsing while you have music playing in the background.  I didn't think audio amounted to a huge processor load and wonder if this isn't some glitch that can be fixed--after all, I listen to music and browse all the time with my smartphone.5-Google.  You have to love google or forget it.  That means using Chrome, Gmail, Drive, Music, Google Docs etc.  If you do already, great.  If not, you better jump on board or don't buy this.  If you are thinking about making the transition, definitely search the internet for quirks ie. specific file types, workarounds, etc.  May not be \"doable\" for you.6-Keyboard.  Solid chicklet-style keyboard.  Fullsize.  Definitely better than most $500 laptops out there.  I love it.7-Trackpad.  I was always a mouse guy.  I immediately paired the Microsoft bluetooth mouse with the Chromebook as soon as I set it up.  But this trackpad is easy to use, so much so that I may ditch the mouse.  First trackpad that I'm starting to really dig--just after 2 days!8-Ports.  Not a lot.  Just 2 USB 2.0 ports.  No SD card reader.  No HDMI.  Not a problem for me since I am used to using Google Drive or a USB thumbdrive.9-Processing speed.  This is not a fast computer.  Some webpages take noticeably longer to load.  I feel this is the main downside to this laptop.Bottom line, I considered a high end Ultrabook (namely, the Samsung ATIV Plus or the LENOVO YOGA 2 PRO) but in the end, the Chromebook satisfies 90% of my travel needs, and 100% of my sitting-in-front-of-the-TV-browsing needs.  Lastly, I bought my Chromebook 11 from Google Play.  After having an issue with my Nexus 7 after 11 months of ownership, I will say that Google customer service is top notch and a pleasure to deal with.  Something to think about.

I wanted to let it settle in a bit.This is my second Chromebook (Samsung the first). From the moment I opened it up it just felt solid. I am an Apple Fanboy and I had been put off by the Samsung build. It looked old a couple of weeks after I got it. The HP11 still looks brand new.Let's not get carried away though. This is a basic computer. It is perfect for those who surf the Internet and write  emails. I use the full array of Google Apps though and while I occasionally run into a rough patch it is usually about me getting used to the concept of everything being online. There is usually a solution.The negatives? I wish the usb ports were 3.0 and I wish they were powered more so I could charge my iPhone while working with the system. I wish there was an SD card slot but I'm looking into getting a reader which I think will solve that problem.What do I like? First of all it is featherweight. It is the lightest little guy I have ever owned. The screen is spectacular, especially for a $279 computer. Be warned though, that it does reflect quite a bit in certain circumstances. I have trouble using it out on my patio. The Samsung with it's matted screen is better for that. (Cool thing about Chrome is moving between the two computers is just like using one system). The keyboard is just right. The touchpad is pretty good. All of those things are subjective though. To each his own.The design is sporty and unique versus trying to be an Apple lookalike. People regularly ask me what it is.I'm very, very happy with the whole Chromebook concept and especially this version of it. At this price point I'll be able to swap it out for newer models as they get better and I am pretty sure I will also get a Chromebox as they become more available in the next 12 months.One more thing. My power supply....not a brick but a wonderful, light design, went bad. My call to customer service was smooth as silk and I had a new one in 3 days at no cost. Meanwhile, because of the micro usb design I was able to use other chargers while I waited.Good job HP. It moved me to order one of your new little tablets which I get today. All of this from an Apple Fanboy (still).", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "4.4", "Author": "Pigearth", "ReviewID": "R302JKEPVI1WZT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this thing.Returned a Samsung Chromebook today - really liked it but here are the reasons why I'm keeping (I think) this one:Way, way better screen - the smaller the screen size the more important making the most out of the native resolution is, particularly for those of us with old eyes.  Not nearly as sharp my first generation Nexus 7 but we're awhile out from seeing a super sharp Chromebook screen.  The matte black edges do a nice job of offsetting your screen, like a picture frame is used to focus the subject.  A nice psychological trick.More power out of the audio jack - whether driving headphones or running a mini stereo plug-to-rca to my receiver the Samsung is a little anemic.  At 10 the receiver had to be pushed hard to extract the music signal resulting in a bit too much distortion.  Regardless the HP is much more powerful, driving external speakers and its own very good internal speakers easily.The wrist rests don't bow - pressing on it inadvertently hard doesn't creak the chassis.  The entire structure is stiff.Ergonomics - little things like the slightly larger keys, their shape, the tighter build resulting in no loose keys, the beveled front edge and the even chassis temperature all make for a more pleasing experience.  And the trackpad.  It is extremely accurate, so much so if you're coming off a crappy generic Wintel laptop you have to recalibrate your senses.  This one means light pressure - the Samsung's was pretty good, I thought, until I used this.The charger - I thought the USB charger included wasn't going to be powerful.  Though I haven't done a time-tested depleted to full test yet it seems to charge quickly.  I'll append if I ever end up doing so.  Charging my Nexus 7 with it seemed to take about the same as with its native charger, but that has to do with the device throttling of the amperage.  One thing that's super stark is the weight and size difference between the Samsung's traditional brick-with-hair block and the sleekness of the HP's.  Though it's a solid, soldered connection from the USB cable to the brick you can daisy chain your other devices to the Chromebook.  All you'd need to do at night is plug your HP in, then carry one or two other USB cables to run off it.  Way, way nicer than separate bricks.  Battery life is less, I'd say maybe an hour or so.  That doesn't matter to me much - it's plugged in pretty much all the time.  An interesting design note is I'm pretty sure Google/HP designed the micro USB plug to fall out under certain pressure to avoid breakage, similar to Apple's magnetically attached cord.  The fit is tight but will drop out; having ruined a few cable/usb/audio jacks in my day, this is a good idea.Aesthetics - I thought I wouldn't like the white plastic designer-y aspect - wrong.  There's a complete lack of logos to anyone looking at it from the outside, which makes it mysteriously cool.  When the lid is open the 4 color light bar glows a bit; on the inside there's a very subtle \"chrome\" below the screen, finished in chrome of course.  Thank goodness there's no \"powered by Celeron\" stickers to peel off.  On the bottom there's a subtle \"HP\" then, in tiny font, \"Made with Google\".  Classy.  The blue trim, the only available at this time, isn't too fey and is a bit darker than the pictures, which give is a very slightly more manly feel, in case that matters to you.Connectivity - I thought this would be a lot worse than it is.  I was running an HDMI out of my Samsung and, while it worked, it wasn't ideal.  The jack was subject to a lot of strain while it was in my lap and the cable didn't seat properly all the time.  Over time it would get worse.  Of course I used this solution because the Samsung's screen just isn't sharp.  So far with the HP I haven't felt the need to hook it up to a monitor or HDTV.  That says a lot.  If you'd like to you'd need a Slimport ->HDMI/whatever dongle, the super expensive Analogix one isn't necessary.  -  Two USB 2.0 is better for me.  It allows you to daisy chain charging cables, is more widely compatible, and allows for dongles and adapters more easily.  No ethernet out means a $6 USB adapter.  No sD card reader?  No problem, another cheap dongle to the rescue.  You can get a small multi-card reader to pull in all your various mobile storage - sD, micro sD, Compact Flash, etc.  One way I haven't tried yet because Google just introduced this feature this weekend for ARM Chromebooks, is to plug your camera directly in and use Google+ Photos and their new Snapseed editor to transfer and manipulate your files.  If possible the necessity of a card reader is moot.  This is the case of \"It's really nice the Hardware and Software Manufacturers are the same\"._______________________________________________________________________What I don't like about it is it's slow.  For me.  That's all I want to say about that.The file manager - needs some polish.  There's no way to have two open so drag and drop between subfolders requires a lot of clicks in between.  The shortcut feature is ok but not fully functional and the way subfolders display twice in some cases a bit strange.  Also when copying into a folder with subfolders you can not place a single file NOT in a  sub- or root-folder.  Very annoying.  I've reported similar things to Google; if everyone were to do this the OS gets better, so I'd encourage everyone to do so:  [...]Also errors occur when you're copying large files from, say, an external drive to GDrive, whereas if you use the GDrive uploader they don't, so do that.I'm sure there's more but I'm hungry...----------------------------------------------------------------------The charge doesn't last that long, maybe 4.5 to 6hrs. at the outer limit.  No doubt the bright screen and the aforementioned powerful audio out suck a lot of juice and maybe the ARM processor isn't optimal for such, but a minor quibble.  Charging yesterday from 13% to full took about 4hrs. while doing a bunch of other things, including streaming video at times.  Turning it off, obviously, would result in a much faster charge.The OS is doing some weird things with syncing Gdrive to the local cache, huge files.  There is a way to delete them, nevertheless.  Also I looked at a publicly-available Google spreadsheet online, didn't download, and now it is persistently available as being viewable offline.  Very annoying and can't get rid of it.Google+ Photo app is still displaying incorrectly, rendering it unusable.While the base is very sturdy the screen is quite flexible, so I'd be careful putting it in a backpack with books on that side.  Adjoining the base would be fine.  Also the glossy white, while smudgy, doesn't really look as bad dirty as a piano black one.  Or a non-oleophobic smart phone in the sun.I was unsure about the one-sided outputs but can now see the wisdom of the layout.  You only have to worry about entanglements on that side rather than be swarmed by cords.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Chrome OS buggy, some apps not fully fleshed out.  But from experience I know the developers are working hard to improve the product on a daily basis.  It's only a matter of time.Had to return previous unit due to what I thought was a hardware problem.  Turns out it was a software problem (see above).Track pad observation:  new units are very sensitive and don't glide well.  Use it a bit, allow your finger (and french fry) oils permeate the track pad.  Much smoother tracking and two-finger scrolling will occur, trust me.Kit Kat 4.4 Android introduced today to streamline Android processes, Chrome referenced to be sped up.  Hopefully that means Chrome OS so we'll see the ARM not overwhelmed at times.  Hopefully.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3 Nov 2013Unfortunately I don't have another one of these; serving streaming radio will cache so much data my Nexus 7 will eventually bog and stop playing.  With ChromeOS it will run forever without a glitch (knock wood) due to its streamlined nature.Speaking of music I found out the speakers are stereo, which is pretty apparent when you're at the unit typing.  Pretty cool.A potentially great, great feature I've been using a lot is the Google+ Photo Editor - really nice effects but the software needs a bit of work to display larger when doing fine detail work, plus the clone tool is a bit of a mystery.  It would sure be nice of someone built in layers functionality into it but really the multiple slider tools offer a lot of quick and moderately advanced fixes for photo sharing.  Of course if you don't use or like Google+ just download the edited pictures and upload them to Facebook, the machine makes quick work of that. Added:  I'm convinced the editing software does a heckuva lot, such as noise reduction in shadows, that I could never get in Photoshop 6.0 without a lot of manual work.  I'm regularly extracting good, usable photos from something that no one would look at twice.  Gotta say the editing algorithms are spot on and not heavy-handed so far.  But heavy-handed is there when you want it.If you do any video editing check out the Auto Awesome feature for it - it can do amazing things automagically, including adding music to sync with cuts.  There's a video out there the developer claims to have let the software do 90% of the work to the finished film.  Nice that you can use cloud storage for the file AND web servers and software for crunching the data.Google+'s, and Google's, privacy policy seems less invasive to me than Facebook's, though I may be wrong.Though the screen is pretty nice the size of the hp11 lends itself nicely as a Chromecast controller, meaning you can have your cake and eat it too.The black levels of the display are really nice, meaning you can keep the brightness down in a dimly-lit room and still see the typefaces easily due good contrast.Contrary to what I said earlier it IS possible to have two File Mangers open - just right click the icon to open a new window.

But the Chromebook 11 is a great laptop nonetheless.My Chromebook 11 (the Cerulean/White theme) was bought in-store at Best Buy. The packaging was super cheap. Its practically cardboard. But it was pretty thick--its tape kept it together when I unboxed it.During unboxing, I encountered a few difficulties with the packaging, but that's a pro for the security measures Google took to secure the laptop in the box. On the top there's a little disposable card defining the different things you can do with the Chromebook (which is limited) in a few simple words. Below it is the Chromebook itself. Under the Chromebook is the charger. The cable is not detachable. There is a HP Chromebook 11 user manual in it as well if you need some help setting stuff up.When starting up the Chromebook 11, the setup process is pretty easy. Its even easier if you already have a gmail account. The password you use for your gmail account corresponds to the login area when powering on the computer. You can tweak most of the settings in the Chrome browser.After a little less than month of use, the Chromebook got all of my basic stuff done. The Chrome OS was super simple to use and get recognized to. I'll start with the OS itself.Operating SystemThe operating system was super simple to use even if you're coming from OS X, Windows 7 (specifically, because 8.1 is cancer), or Linux. The OS is like any other. It has a menu bar that contains apps that are web-based (explained later) and interchangeable and a \"meh\", but simple file browser for files in the computer. The \"apps\" button (similar to the Windows button on the bottom left) is awkward because it only browses through all your applications you've \"installed\". I wouldn't call it convenient to use as I would like to see it revamped to have some of the core apps or features you'd find in a typical button that's supposed to be in what I'd call a \"home\" button (for example, the files browser alternative to \"my computer\" on Windows). Its simple and it works, but I'd like to see improvements.The browser that is specifically used on the Chromebook is Google Chrome. Now this is what makes the Chromebook different. Many of the applications on the Chromebook are alternatives and \"google-ified\" versions of something like the Office Suite or Apple Suite. For example, presentations, documents, and spreadsheets apps are changed into stuff like Google Docs, Google Presentations, etc. On the creative suite, that's really empty honestly. I've used web-based video and GFX editors, and they aren't as good as stuff like iMovie, Windows Movie Maker, Photoshop, or Pixelmator. The Chromebook is not for those looking to get creative work done. But since this is Google, I am determined to see how they'll solve this or even if they'll solve this. Also, because these are web-based apps (and a few apps that can be installed for offline use), internet connection is really important when using the Chromebook. Its use pretty much relies on whether you have access or not.Other than that, the OS is simple and could have a lot more things, but what can you ask for an OS that's really just starting out.Hardware from my perspectiveI value candor. I don't really know what defines good specifications, but I do know a few basic concepts. But all I care about really hardware-wise is how rough or smooth the performance is and how it is under light and intense activities. Also hardware-wise, I will discuss the other things provided in the computer such as the light bar on the top, the webcam, the keyboard, and the trackpad. Then there will be a section dedicated to the overall design and I will conclude with the performance.Starting off with the lightbar, I don't see much use with it. The light bar is basically cool-looking Google branding. I assume you can program it, but I hear that you can only do that on a Chromebook Pixel. Moving on, we have the webcam up top. The webcam is pretty horrible honestly if you plan on doing some professional recordings. However what do you expect from a laptop that's this cheap? Webcam quality is definitely pretty \"eh\". Very slow webcam processing, and if you look at it as a camera, it's basically bad. Transferring to the keyboard and trackpad, I find that it is similar to the Apple keyboard, just losing just a small bit of required pressure. Its not the best for some users, but it definitely is better than some other keyboards on some laptops (*cough* surface *cough*). They keys are all recognizable, however since this is a web-based OS, the computer generally also should be web-based. There is no caps lock keys. It is replaced with the \"search\" key. On the top you have the \"escape\" button, and it seems like a strange layout, but you have the \"back/forward\" button, the \"refresh button\", the \"widescreen\" button, the \"window\" command (views all of the windows you have open in a layout much like the multi-tasking on iOS devices or the \"f3\" button for OS X), the \"lower/raise brightness\" buttons, the \"mute, soften, and raise volume\" buttons, and lastly the power button. It seems like a weird layout, but I find that they are useful at times and not so much. If only they used Apple's keyboard layout it'd be awesome (listing the button number and its default action when pressed, however still leaving the user the option to program the keys). The trackpad on the other hand isn't Mac trackpad quality, but its definitely still \"average\". When I use the trackpad, I feel that browsing around with the trackpad has a lot of stuttering. I know that this is not a performance problem because I found out that you have to be light on pressure. Make as if you are caressing the trackpad. When clicking the trackpad on the other hand, two-finger clicking is sometimes unresponsive and only responds as the user clicking with one finger. The actual clicking itself varies. I don't know if this is a defect with my device, but it just feels like the trackpad will break, and then another day it feels nice and sturdy. Overall its sort of neutral between being bad and being awesome.Secondly, I'd like to talk about the design because I really do like it. Obviously the Chromebook is not expandable really--the Chromebook is practically sewn together in plastic. This may be negative or positive depending on how you look at it. The design is still really nice though. There is a blue accent around the keyboard, and two large rectangular blue feet under the computer that sitll look nice. Other than the light bar, HP/Google branding,  and the feet, its practically a white-painted computer. There's no screws, no openings, no nothing other than the ports. Speaking of the ports (great segway, right?), there are no ports on the right side! This has already gotten me worried. The ports will all be found on the left of the machine. There is a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (no microphone jack), two USB ports (not sure if it is 2.0/3.0), and the charging port. That is it. This is very limited, and thus that is why I dislike that they didn't do much about this. Again, I wouldn't expect something like all of the display ports like HDMI, VGA, etc., but I wonder why they didn't have an SD card reader. As a amateur 13-year-old photographer, I would've appreciated the SD card reader but I still have to use my iMac to edit photos and such.Lastly, I'd like to discuss the performance. The Chromebook 11 from an amateur-at-specs' perspective is actually quite quick when getting light tasks done. When doing performance-heavy stuff like watching a YouTube video alone at 1080p, the video looks good (I don't want to review the display because it already looks good on the laptop), however it tends to stutter. Watching videos at 720p on the other hand is pretty nice and although some quality is sacrificed, it still gives me a lot less stuttering. I also did some interacting on the web on a few websites like Kongregate. I find that the Chromebook 11 didn't fair that well on heavy websites like that. Not something the Chromebook is too great in, however it is still usable. I could go on, but that last website will pretty much wrap up all of the other applications one might use on a Chromebook.Generally, Chromebooks are new and they're off to a decent start. I like the computer for its price/performance ratio. I would pay $50 more for a computer as good as this on a Windows platform. I would definitely recommend the Chromebook to anyone just wanting to get light stuff done or browse the web. I wouldn't recommend it to professionals in most departments, however some of the alternatives on the Chrome OS like Google Docs is something you should still try and see if you like. There's just a few things that Google could do to improve this computer and sell it at a relatively similar price.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "STUDENT REVIEW", "Author": "Bacon", "ReviewID": "R2X2YVWPZGSHUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best Chromebook yet! I recently got this from the Google Play store. I previously had the Samsung Chromebook 11 which was a good, however, this Chromebook is great and well worth the 30 dollars more. They may have the same internals and the speed is the same and the battery life. For 30 dollars more you get a brighter, more colorful, IPS Screen. The IPS screen has a vastly better viewing angle then the LCD screen on the Samsung. You will notice the screen quality difference immediately if you had previously had the Samsung. Also for 30 dollars more you get a way better external casing. If you have ever seen the older White Unibody Macbook's. This is almost exactly the same build but thinner due to no CD/DVD drive. It is built quite a bit better then the Samsung and also looks way more stylized. The Trackpad is better then the slightly jumpy Samsung Trackpad. I haven't noticed any real battery life differences between the better screened HP over the Samsung. Overall, if you are looking to buy the Samsung Chromebook I would highly recommend this HP over the Samsung. As I haven't had the other Chromebooks I can't compare those, though, I have seen them at this one is at least the best looking that I know of other then the Chromebook Pixel which is 1200 dollars and does the same things. You do lose the USB 3.0 and the HDMI out slots with the HP however, but unless you absolutely need to have those get the HP. I think part of the reason it is better then the Samsung is that the HP one is designed specifically by Google just like their 1200 dollar Chromebook Pixel was. I use the computer as a student in college and can say that you can do anything that you need with this computer when you are in school and don't have to pay for word processing or a expensive computer. This is a very nice computer. I will say this though. Do not get the Google designed cases for this Chromebook. They are 49.99 and are not nearly as good as others 11 inch cases. I would highly recommend getting the Incase Terra 11 inch zip up case off of Amazon for 20-25 dollars. It fits perfect and is very nice. In conclusion, if you want a nice computer and case for 300 dollars total and are a student or need only word processing and internet browsing and videos online then this is the computer you want and if you want a nice case for it, then get the Incase Terra 11 off Amazon as well.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "I wish I liked it more...", "Author": "martrom", "ReviewID": "RUJGVYQXA4KOZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The form factor is great, and the screen is excellent (the best of any Chromebooks I've tested).

Basically, I wish I could use this as a barebones laptop for traveling, one that I wouldn't have to worry much about due to its price point.Unfortunately, with more than about 4 tabs open, scrolling and switching windows has noticeable lag.  You won't however have any trouble watching Netflix, Hulu or HD Youtube videos -- just don't expect it to respond quickly if you are a heavy multitasker.  Although I purchased with the expectation that a Chromebook is \"just a browser\", for me the slowness is a dealbreaker (side note: I installed XFCE and some programs such as Firefox, Gimp, and LibreOffice using Crouton on this notebook, and they all ran surprisingly ok).If you could combine the Acer guts with the HP screen/form, it'd probably be the perfect Chromebook.  As the lineup stands this year, all of them still fall a bit short of what I feel is worth the expense.  The Samsung, with a worse screen, can be gotten for $200, but it's as slow as this HP (which is too slow).  The Acer C720 is speedy and also a nice looking machine, but the screen has limited viewing angles.The 1st generation of Chromebooks was interesting, this 2nd generation is compelling, but I think it'll be another refresh of hardware before I'm happy to spend $250-$300 on one.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Built Budget Chromebook But Already Outdated", "Author": "BKarno", "ReviewID": "R3L9YPNJ578PWG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have 4 Chromebooks in our family.  The latest Samsung model, an Acer C720 4GB and C720 2GB, and this HP Chromebook 11.  The HP is tops in build quality, sound, and keyboard, and the IPS screen dominates the other current offering's TN panels.  However, it's performance is nowhere near the standard being set by the Haswell chipped models.  So why would you buy this over the others?The build quality is really good compared to the other Chromebooks.  Very solid body; although I wish the display / lid was a bit more rigid and the finish not so glossy (really shows fingerprints).  Excellent keyboard.  None of the other Chromebooks we own is as nice to type on. The Samsung has nice keys, but these are much better; nice size / spacing and very quiet.  Excellent speakers.  If you rely on on-board sound you will really enjoy the performance of the HP's top firing, under keyboard speakers.  And of course, the display.  The IPS screen is clear and bright, the colors are so much more natural than the Samsung or the Acers, and the viewing angles are stellar as well.  Only the $1300 Pixel has better screen in a Chromebook.  If you can live with the lower performance of this Chromebook you will certianly be satisfied with the machine as a whole.  As long as you aren't opening tons of tabs at the same time it should work well.  My daughter uses this HP at college and she really loves it.  She notes that it streams Netflix and Hulu Plus really good for her, and that using Google Drive/Document and her cloud printer has worked really well.  The only complaint she has is with the charge times, and I have noticed this too.  Where many have praised the ability to charge with any Micro USB wire, charging is slow.  Even with the original charger (the recalled model that came with it) the charging was not as fast as the the Acers or the Samsung.  And if you try to charge this with the charger supplied with your smart phone it will take an even longer time and you will not be able to charge while you use it (the battery will still drain).Some additional observations.  The lack of an SD card slot, and no USB 3 may be an issue for some, and no HDMI makes extending the screen a bit more difficult.  Yes the Micro USB is Slim Port capable, but you can't charge and extend the screen at the same time.  The 16GB drive is small, but if you have transitioned to working in the cloud this shouldn't be an issue.  Still, even with a 100GB Google Drive account, I swapped out the SSD in my C720 for a 128GB unit and ended up with over 100 GB of local drive space.  As for the trackpad.  I really like the size and feel of it, but it can be a little jumpy sometimes.  Still it is generally smooth, quiet, and the clicker works well.  The Bluetooth works good with my Bose Soundlink Mini, and I have even hooked up my Nuforce Icon DAC via USB.  The Chromebooks all recognize the DAC and it sounds great with music played through Google Play.I give it 4 stars for the build, stellar screen, and cost to value.  The speed is adequate, but it lags with a lot of websites; Facebook being the one I notice the most.  My ideal Chromebook would have the screen, sound, and keyboard of the HP 11 with the performance of the Haswell machines.  One should also consider that with the popularity of the Chromebooks growing, additional manufacturers like Dell getting into the game, and the certainty that there will be a whole new crop of new and improved machines coming in the very near future, this machine may be outdated sooner than later.

While the HP does run a bit more in cost, it is worth it in my opinion because the HP is much sturdier and a better looking design than the Samsung.  The multi-touch pad is great and very easy to use.  The AC adapter is also much smaller than on the Samsung model and doesn't have the heavy awkward power brick sometimes seen on other laptop models.

I recently sold my 11 inch air so I can get a 13\" pro, for more satisfying movie watching experiences. I knew 30 minutes in, that I am going to keep this Chromebook. It's functionality is minimal, as everything is done through the chrome browser, which I love. There's no need to have several programs open, when you can surf the web, type up a document, check your email and keep up with sports scores, news and updates all from one program. The screen is absolutely beautiful and I can type on this keyboard all day. The sound quality is excellent and the boot speed is impressive to say the least. My only disappointments are how hard it is change audio tracks on movies with different audio tracks (which I still havent figured out, but I know i will), it was a bit slow, out the box and, though there's a keyboard shortcut for it, there's no caps lock button.

Do your homework before buying a Chromebook.  Assuming you are willing to forego the full-feature of a traditional operating system--and I'm not going into those trade-off's here--then you are down to choosing which Chromebook you want.  All Chromebooks are relatively cheap, and therefore come with their own trade-off's.  I suggest you ignore any review of this or any Chromebook that rips on Chrome itself--there are plenty of other ways to get information on Chrome than Amazon reviews if you are unsure.I picked this one because I knew I cared more about how the screen looks and how it sounds than whether web sites take a few less seconds to load or whether I can have 20 tabs open.  I almost exclusively browse the web and watch YouTube videos on it.  Browsing will have upwards of 5 tabs before I lose track of what's going on.  It is perfectly serviceable for that level of activity.  For browsing, it's news sites, Gmail, Calendar, Keep, Drive--all Google properties--and it does just fine.  Not lightening quick by a long shot, but plenty fast when I know the screen/keyboard/sound combination helps me to enjoy the content.  And make no mistake, this particular Chromebook is more about content consumption than creation.  That said, it can and does do both.The visual design--no screws, no fan ports, simple white with blue accents--and the lack of a fan are huge X factors for me.  That I can sit in a quiet room and not add any noise like a tablet is great!  The visual appeal of a simple white (some would say Macbook knockoff) case is something you either care about or do not.  It's not make or break for me, but adds to likeability of the device post-purchase.  Small things like how the black bezel frames the screen make the whole package visually appealing.Be clear--if speed is of critical importance to you and any hiccup or delay will affect your enjoyment.......then this isn't the device for you!!!  There are better choices for raw speed with their own sets of trade-offs available.I only occasionally wish for (and would be willing to pay a little more $$ for) longer battery life and/or a slightly faster CPU in that order.

I have been using the Chromebook 11now for a few weeks and I like it. Many reviews that I have seen criticise the machine for being underpowered or complaining that a chromebook can't do what a \"regular\" laptop can do. I think the Chromebook 11 is not trying to be a \"regular\" laptop but a chromebook which is to say a web browser with a keyboard that easily accesses Google services and any website and being very light and portable. I think it does this very well.  The screen is very nice has very good brightness and looks very crisp. The keyboard is very nice to use. I like that the machine can be charged from via a micro usb connector and does last all day for me travelling around. The machine is also very nice to hold and loos good. I carry it in a satchel with my iPad Air and it is very easy to carry around.

The keyboard is fantastic, the trackpad is decent, and the display is just as good as the one on my 11\" Macbook Air. So what's the trade off? A very limited operating system that needs to be connected to the Internet all the time in order to be useful.Chromebooks are computers that boot up to Google's ChromeOS - which itself is pretty much just a Chrome web browser. Google has built a nice eco system around it with quite a large catalog of HTML 5 apps that run inside Chrome on nearly all platforms. The Chromebook will sync itself to your other chrome installations, meaning that every extension and bookmark will be right where it is on your other devices.The problem is that the Chromebook becomes significantly less useful when it's offline. Documents are mostly inaccessible and apps that aren't expressly written to run offline in the browser won't load. The Chromebook 11 lacks an internal cellular modem so it will need to be within range of a WiFi access point (or a cellular hotspot) in order for it to work outside of a home or office. I did find that Google hid \"quickoffice,\" an app that allows offline document editing, but I was only able to get it working if I had previously downloaded a compatible document to the machine first.Under the hood the Chromebook 11 has what is essentially a tablet or smartphone processor. It works fairly well but it isn't as snappy as a PC or modern tablet might be. YouTube videos stutter a bit when loading and text sometimes lags behind key presses when working on a document.So who's this for? It's a great kids machine provided they'll have constant and reliable access to the network. Since the documents are stored in the Google cloud there's little chance of losing anything due to a damaged or stolen device. Also those who are considering dumping their PC's for a tablet might want to consider this instead as it's more useful as a productivity device - provided they don't mind living in Google's cloud.", "Date": "October 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot recommend until Google & HP resolve the power system design issues ...", "Author": "Ron Musselman", "ReviewID": "ROFMB23QROU9T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Traded in the Samsung version when the HP was released because the design is far superior to the Samsung, as is the screen.

Might be a strange way to describe it but the laptop feels \"friendly\" in your hand - very smooth plastic with rounded edges.The Chrome OS is the same regardless of hardware so the HP is just as easy to use as all others. I really like that the system is ready to go and personalized automatically the first time I log in. All systems should work this way.Unfortunately, my experience has gone downhill rapidly. First, I had to wait for a replacement charger when the original was reported as defective. Google and HP handled that very poorly. Had it not been for media coverage I never would have known about the problem. Once I did know there was no communication from either company. When I finally received the new charger the Chromebook immediately displayed a graphical system message asking me if my charger looked like the new version. That was a nice touch and something that should have happened the moment Google and HP realized there was a problem.The new charger seemed to work well until 2 days ago. The system will not power on or charge. The charging light doesn't even come on. I've tried all the suggested troubleshooting steps to no avail - waiting for Google to respond to a service ticket now.Although the laptop looks very nice I can't rate the system more than a 2.

Not many people talk about charging it because they assume that any USB port will charge it. Sadly, this assumption is false and below I will elaborate.The Chromebook 11 will charge from any USB port without issue but it may not provide 100% of the power needed to keep the laptop charged while it is in use. On virtually every charger, other than the stock charger, the UI will report that you are using a \"low power charger\".  The reason for this is not because the charger cannot supply up to 3A, in this battery it actually can. But it depends more on the voltage supplied.The stock charger provides 5.25 vDC with a maximum current rating of 3A. Virtually every charger designed for microUSB devices only supplies ~5.0 vDC.  By not having the 0.25 vDC the chromebook devices will not pull full at full capacity. Instead it is rate limited at some rate I have not been able to determine. I believe it to be somewhere between 700ma and 1.2A. My guess at their reasoning behind this is so that the chromebook does not try to overdraw the charging source when it detects that the voltage is below 5.25 vDC and an assumption is made that if it detects 5.25vDC, it can draw at 3A.I originally purchased this chromebook because I really liked that it could be charged by any USB port and my intentions were to buy one of those 12,000mAh extended life batteries to triple the life of the device. Even though it will charge it at a reduced rate I cannot prevent myself from rating this device with 5 stars because the compromises are well worth the flexibility. I just wanted others to understand that until someone comes out with a 5.25 vDC charger we're stuck with the original charger; not even those 36w car chargers will suffice. I really hope a manufacturer out there realizes this and designs a 12v car charger and a battery which can supply the full voltage at the appropriate amperage for this device.Hope this helps", "Date": "November 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really happy with the design and build quality of this little machine.

Hubbard", "ReviewID": "R128C41Z7WTLDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the black version of the Chromebook 11 for my daughter in high school. I was tired of administering Windows laptops and wanted something that she could use both for writing papers ( Google Docs ) and internet access to school websites and online text books and not have to worry about games, viruses, etc. She always has WiFi access at home, school and the local library, so a Chromebook made a lot of sense. The small size size 12\" x 8\" x 0.7\" and weight ~2 lbs makes it easy to lug around in a backpack all day.About the Charger:The charger is a 3A micro-USB charger that is about the size of a cell phone charger (much smaller than a bulky laptop charger). Huge bonus is this charger can also charge her Galaxy Android phone, so she only needs to carry around a single charger - and its small. A regular 1A or 2A micro-USB cell phone charger will also slowly charge the battery if the Chromebook is off, or dramatically slow down the battery discharge of an already charged battery if the Chromebook is on. If the battery is completely dead and you only have a 1A or 2A charger you need to keep the Chromebook off until the battery gets a bit of a charge. Confusing - I know. My only concern is that micro-USB connectors in general are rather fragile compared to large \"barrel\" jacks. The cable is connected directly to the wall adapter ( instead of a USB-A connector ), so if the micro-USB connector breaks ( it happens ), you must buy another $20 3A charger from Google or HP instead of just replacing a $5 USB cable. Standard USB cables won't handle 3 amps, so I get why its soldered directly, still its unfortunate. Only the special HP 3A chargers will completely power the Chromebook and charge the battery at the same time, so you really need at least one. I think having all portable electronic devices charge from the same micro-USB connector is a fantastic move for the industry though. Are you listening Tim?Other features: The screen and keyboard are fantastic. The CPU is fast and perfectly adequate for Google Docs and web surfing. This isn't truly a laptop replacement, more of a tablet with built in keyboard and minimal local storage. That said, it is much faster ( and smaller ) than the MSI U100 Intel Atom Netbook that it replaced.Cloud Printing is simple enough assuming you have a Windows PC connected to printers, you just enable cloud printing through the Chrome browser on the PC and then your Chromebook ( and all your devices with Google accounts ) will have access to those printers - Very slick Google. Haven't tried Google Docs offline mode yet, but as far as I know it should work to write documents even outside of WiFi range.I definitely plan to purchase more Chromebooks in the future as I think it is quite practical for a large household to have a single Windows PC supplemented by tablets and Chromebooks.

Assuming you do want a chromebook, this is a great choice.Actually, I should stipulate that if you are a power browser, that is someone who uses more than half a dozen browser tabs or windows at once, you'd probably be happier with one of the new Haswell Celeron chromebooks like the Acer C720. I'm not a power user, and I owned Acer's previous chromebook model, and my biggest gripes were that it had a rubbish keyboard, terrible speakers, a dismal display, and its battery life was less than three hours (at least for me). When I saw the new chromebooks hitting the market and decided to upgrade, I had to choose between getting the new Acer, which slightly improved the processing speed and dramatically improved battery life over my current model, or this one, which only doubled the battery life and actually had less power, but was supposed to be a serious improvement in design and build quality.I chose the HP Chromebook 11, and I'm very pleased. The screen is gorgeous, the best you'll find on anything even twice as expensive as this device. It has true colors and great viewing angles. It's a glossy screen, so it's not as easy to see outside, but if that's not a concern for you, it destroys the new Acer model. The keyboard is similarly terrific. It's not just better than Acer's, it's actually a joy to type on. I have never used this nice of a keyboard on a budget laptop, and believe me, I've owned a fair number of budget laptops from all manner of companies. The speakers are my favorite feature. They are clear and powerful, far better than anything I've had on a laptop before, let alone a chromebook. The battery life is around six hours for me, and that's a big step up from the older Acer, though not as spectacular as the Acer C720, with its 8+ hours.Bottom line - if you want the most power and longevity in a new model chromebook, get the Acer C720. However, if you want adequate power and battery life combined with the very best display, keyboard, speakers, and overall design, this is the model you should buy.Update (12/24/13): These machines recently made headlines when the chargers were recalled because of a small number of reports involving overhearing, so I sent for a replacement and it was rapidly FedEx-ed to my door, along with return postage for my old charger and a $25 gift card for the Google Play store.

Bought this product from another vendor because it was out of stock.  Up to this point I have used low end windows laptops. This laptop was surprisingly good compared to them. The screen is awesome. I have to say it again, the screen is awesome because of the large vertical viewing angles. Horizontal viewing angles are important if you are sharing your screen with someone is sitting next to you.  Vertical viewing angles are very very important for the quality of image that you see. I have previously been subject to cheap TN panels on the laptops I have used and these result in poor vertical viewing angles.  A poor vertical viewing angle means that I see the colors shift at the top and bottom of a screen no matter how I position the screen.  This color shift appears as if portions of the image are seen as if they are a photographic negative of the actual image. This laptop has a decent quality IPS panel which doesn't suffer from this problem.  It is fantastic to get accurate color top to bottom, no screen fiddling necessary. You see the screen as it was meant to be seen.  IMHO it's worth sacrificing a faster cpu and more ram for an IPS screen.  It's that good. The keyboard is nice as well.  It is a nice full size keyboard which means I can touch type on it at full speed.  In addition, it has useful keys in place of the function keys that are found on a typical windows keyboard.  For example, there are keys for expanding a browser window to full screen, going forward, backward and reloading a page.  I actually use these while browsing instead of hunting for a icon or menu item.I am a bit of a tinkerer and I like debian and I was able to install debian to run along side chrome os easily.  I booted into developer mode (\"esc-refresh-power\" and then at the warning screen \"cntl-d\"), logged into the system using my google credentials, downloaded crouton ([...]), opened a crosh shell (ctrl-alt-t), invoked a bash shell in the crosh shell (\"shell\") and then used the command \"sudo sh -e ~/Downloads/crouton -r wheezy -n debian -t lxde\" to install a nice debian lxde chroot. Note that booting into developer mode erases all user data so make sure any important files are saved somewhere else first.  A quick \"sudo startlxde\" in the bash shell booted the debian chroot.  From within chrome OS a quick cntl-alt-shift-forward (forward at the top of the keyboard, not the lower right) switches me to the debian chroot. Cntl-alt-shift-back switches back to chromeOS from the chroot. The chromeOS and the chroot share the Downloads folder so it is easy to use the same files from each OS environment. From inside this debian chroot I installed abiword, gnumeric, evince, hardinfo, and geany. I plan on checking out the google offline apps to see how they compare to my favorite debian apps.  Search the web for \"ubuntu chromebook\" and find the article on lifehacker or how-to-geek for more info on crouton, entering developer mode and chroots.UPDATE 3/13/14After a few months of use here are my findings.  Crouton and linux is not a practical solution for this machine or any chromebook for that matter.  First, there is no way to turn off the boot sequence that gives you a choice to go into developer mode.  You are only a space bar push away from the machine erasing any customizations and installations of crouton.  Also by using developer mode you disable one of the most compelling features of chromeos, the verified boot.  Now you could completely remove chromeos but this would require flashing the boot ROM with non-chromeos boot code.  I'm not sure if this particular model has an easy way to turn off the write protection on the boot ROM.  I also don't know if there is a boot ROM image that will work with this particular machine.  So to make a long story short, if you are primarly interested in linux, get a cheap windows machine and install linux.  There are too many comprises using crouton on a chromebook and installing a full blown linux is going to be PITA due to the need to reflash a boot ROM.", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you like the Samsung Chromebook, you'll like this one", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R31IG4QG8YWFH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to bother getting into the debate on whether a chromebook is a good choice versus a netbook, laptop, mac, whatever.

Ive used a Chromebook as my main laptop for a half-year stretch, everything went fine, bought a MacBook to try, and now I'm back on Chromebooks. A week ago I bought an HP 11 in red from Google, here is my breakdown.Pros :- Screen. Amazing color clarity. Blacks are black, there is no light bleeding, no viewing angle issues, it's really impressive when compared to previous models.- Speakers are loud! Half volume is enough to fill my living room with sound. They do crackle if you turn them up too loud, but there is usually no need to.- Keyboard is *incredible*. Before this CB, the Series 5 had my favorite keyboard, this one is better yet. Springy and not too shallow, VERY quiet.- The build quality is what really blew me away about this CB. It's solid! Other Chromebooks, especially the 5 550, were prone to creaking, especially when you open them, this one is silent and extremely well built (or at least it feels that way). The plastic isn't cheap like on the Series 3 and 5, it doesn't flex.- It's silent. I couldn't imagine a better companion for class than this Chromebook. I actually hear 'phantom fan noise' every now and then, having used a MBA with a loud fan for so long, silent operation is great.- Battery life. Compared to my 3g Series 5, its WAY shorter (the 5 gets 8 hours), but compared to the 550 its about 2 hours longer. It's nearly identical to the Series 3. It's not super long, but not short at all. I can take it with me to class and not have to charge it if I work offline when taking notes (you can use Google Docs and Slides offline!!). Because it's charged with a micro usb, you can buy extended batteries designed for charging phones to extend the battery life, though I can't see needing that.- Price. $279 is REALLY hard to beat for the quality of this thing.- USB charging! I can unplug my Chromebook and plug in my phone to the same charger. My phone gets topped off before the Chromebook battery goes down even 5%, it's great not having to find a cable for my phone anymore.Cons :- The trackpad could be more accurate. It feels great, but the Series 3 and 550 both have glass coatings which made them wonderful to use. The HP 11 is similar to the Series 5, which is still great, but not as smooth or accurate.- Chrome OS is not fully optimized for ARM. This isn't a flaw with the Chromebook, it's Chrome OS. Until the Series 3 (released last year), Chrome OS has been on Intel chips. That's a solid 2+ years of development for x86/x64. In time though, Chrome OS will become better on ARM. My Series 5 still runs Chrome OS well (my girlfriend uses it every day), I imagine the Series 3 and HP 11 will run it well into the future also.I would have no problem recommending the HP 11 to anyone. Some will say \"Get the Haswell one instead\", and honestly, I've got a 550 with a Sandybridge Celeron and Ive used a C720 (which I shipped back for this one!), the difference is noticeable maybe 5% of the time. The other 95% of the time what I DO notice is the keyboard, speakers and display. Google and HP made the most-used parts of a Chromebook the best they could for the price and sacrificed a little performance for it, and personally, I prefer the small size and crazy-good build quality over small performance gains any day. If you are into comparing specs, maybe you're missing the point of using a Chromebook.edit: zRAM is enabled by default in Chrome OS now so 'enable swap' is no longer necessary. I do recommend disabling extensions you don't often use and installing Flash Control and AdBlock Plus to speed things up.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointment", "Author": "Qiangli H.", "ReviewID": "R3PQK326GHJUG9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bad charger that broke after not even a monthLaptop gets so slow that you cannot even move the mouse when two tabs are openCamera is terribleSupports no downloadable applicationsChrome store/play is useless, exception for some apps", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "For the money, not much else will beat it.", "Author": "Kyle", "ReviewID": "RDJCTSSSD0RSC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this Chromebook as a gift for my girlfriend. She is a full-time student, nurse, and mom. We already have a 17\" Lenovo laptop in the house, but it's a constant battle of \"who needs the computer\". I wanted to get her something that was not only portable and reliable, but would also suit her taste. Normally against my better judgement, the aesthetic of the HP 11 was a huge deciding factor for my purchase. I figured that at most, she'd have a few tabs open, maybe listen to a song on YouTube, and edit a paper in Office at any given time, so the fact that it wasn't a 'powerhouse' laptop wasn't really an issue.BUILD QUALITY:----------------------I searched high and low for reviews on build quality, screen quality, etc. I have to say that upon messing around with it today for about an hour or two, it has exceeded my expectations. The screen is absolutely beautiful. The clarity and range of color really is just amazing. I was worried that at 11\", it would be a real pain to switch from the 17\" screen I'm so used to. That was not the case at all. I'm 6'1\" and I wouldn't say I've got big hands, but I'm a pretty big guy, and the HP 11 felt very comfortable on my lap. There was no \"squinting\" or straining to see the text on the screen as I feared there would be. Everything was absolutely crisp and clear. As far as the build quality, it feels very rigid. The plastic is very sturdy and the hinge is tight (I feel I need to point out that on any other >$300 laptop I've used, a squeaky or loose hinge is an absolute dealbreaker for me). If I could summarize the overall \"feel\" I get from the actual form of the laptop, it would be \"Plastic Macbook\". The keyboard and trackpad feel great.The speakers are actually built under the keyboard. They get very loud for a laptop. You won't be getting a lot of bass (It's actually almost non-existent), but the midrange and treble is there. For a $225 laptop, it's not getting much better. If you need the bass, there is always the headphone jack (audio was very full and pleasant from there with my headphones!)Oh, and this thing charges with a micro-USB. That is awesome. I have like seven of those things lying around my house, so it's good to know that even if I lose the laptop charger, I can still power on my Chromebook (albeit a bit more slowly)Overall, the HP 11 just feels right. It's great. I had my reservations with buying another HP having owned a Pavilion in the past (Eek. Hard drive failed, hinge creaking from day one, keys breaking off) so I was surprised to see that they seemingly hit it out of the park on this one. Time will tell, but the initial impression is great!PERFORMANCE:-----------------------Most people's main beef with this Chromebook is the performance. I'll be honest, I was worried before it arrived. I was wondering if I had just spent money on a pretty, but unusable laptop. As beautiful as the laptop is, I would have felt like an idiot if it was not even functional. The first thing I did when I got the laptop was open up Chrome (since you won't be doing much else?). I opened my Gmail, my Drive folder, a YouTube page, Facebook, and a Word document. I figured that rather than going on a mission to bog down the computer, I would use the computer as my girlfriend will use it. Talking to a friend on Facebook, writing a paper, listening to music, etc. With all of those tabs open, I only really experienced \"stuttering\" (specifically the YouTube audio) when trying to scroll too fast within a page or switch between tabs back to back to back.Under normal circumstances (i.e; not playing games, programming, and doing video editing at the same time), the laptop will be fine for anyone doing light to moderate browsing and work online. This would be a killer laptop for the non-techies in your life. My girlfriend isn't concerned with video editing/programming/rendering, and most people aren't. They're looking for a simple way to get online, check their email, do some office work. Most people don't need 8GB ram, 4.0 GHz processor, and 1TB hard drive.PROS:---------+ Great screen. Vivid, bright, detailed. It holds a candle to a Macbook's display.+ Very sturdy build. Doesn't feel cheap like most laptops in it's price range+ Stays cool and quiet (no fan!)+ ChromeOS is simple and intuitive. No start menus/control panels/preferences (the kind that scare grandma; there are options within the Chrome browser to customize your experience) to confuse you. It's very straightforward and presented within a very clean user interface.CONS:---------- The HP 11 does not pack a lot of horsepower. It's great for handling web surfing, document editing, video calls, and light YouTubing. You won't be doing heavy photo/video editing, gaming, or programming (unless you boot Ubuntu, but that's a whole different story), but chances are, you aren't looking at a Chromebook if you are doing any of those things.- Sound quality could be better. It's loud and clear, but it could benefit from some more low end.- ChromeOS does not support adding any programs such as iTunes, Photoshop, or VLC. You can get away with alternatives like Google Music and Pixlr Photo Editor.OVERALL:-------------This little thing is pretty cool. Hopefully it holds up over time. I know that software updates won't be an issue until 2018 (the year Google guaranteed it's support). If it does hold up, I see myself grabbing this over my 17\" monster of a Lenovo laptop when I just want to hop online for a bit.Most of the gripes I have with it are things I knew getting into it. I know the ChromeOS in it's current state is a bit limited in what it can do. I knew that it wouldn't be a workhorse of a laptop. I knew that at it's price point, I'd sacrifice things like sound quality for screen quality and yadda-yadda-yadda. I think that's why I was pleasantly surprised when the screen was *that* nice and it was able to do more things at once than I thought it could.Solid purchase; highly recommended!", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Suggested", "Author": "Ryan Mannion", "ReviewID": "R6I766I4NE2Y3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this for my girlfriend and she couldn't be happier.

This little chromebook looks much more expensive than it is & makes a great 2nd computer. The IPS screen on it coupled with the outstanding keyboard & good trackpad is a step above most other chromebooks I've tried. However, I prefer my Acer slightly to this one due to the lack of a touchscreen.  I use a smartphone & am use to tablets so that may matter to me more than most people.  This is still a great device at the price.Update - I've had a lot of keyboard problems with the Acer c720p in the form of some keys not working or only working now & then. This thing though,works great & I love the ability to charge this thing with my smart phone charger. NICE. As soon as Acer fixes or replaces my C720p I plan to sell it. I now have a high end Chromebook Pixel as my primary Chrome device (it is world class), but because I like this thing so much, I plan to keep it as a backup. Great screen, great keyboard & touchpad, & really attractive form factor.  If only it were a little more powerful with a faster chip. Still it is a great device to have on your lap as you watch tv, movies or YouTube. Highly recommended.Update - May 2014 I've been using both Chromebooks a lot since my last update & as a result of OS updates to Chrome all of my keyboard related issues with the Acer c720p have dissappeared. Why I don't know but they have. At the same time, I still love this thing for it's portability, looks, & keyboard. I find it great for texting & e-mails. However anything much beyond that & this thing slows down quickly or stops. Watching movies or videos on-line is pretty much a no go on this device. I've never managed to watch a two hour movie on this but if I did, my guess is it would take 4-5 hours & the battery would be long gone before that happened. The IPS screen is still great, the keyboard is pretty good, but I\"m now finding the track pad pretty weak. If this thing had a Haswell processor & a bit better touchpad, & as long as I'm wishing, a touch screen, then it would be an Ideal Chromebook. But now that I've had time to use it for a while, I plan to sell it or downstream it to one of my kids.  The processor makes it's ongoing use just too frustrating. Get a Dell or a Acer c720p if you like a touchscreen as much as I do.  If you can, I might wait for the summer to see how the newer models turn out.

Its simple and easy to use, which is good for me because i am pretty stupid when it comes to computers, and it looks and runs like a computer that is 3x as expensive. and i also want to give a shout out to the \"cloud-like\" system that automatically backs up everything i have on my computer! the only drawback i have to it is that i cant play the sims on it (im addicted) BUT my old toshiba is back up and running (slowly, but its running) so i can still use it for gaming.If you are a intense gamer, do not have access to either internet in some form (if you are an ethernet person, you will need a USB adapter, but mine only cost $21), you NEED a disc thingy, then i would go with a different computer. but if you are just using your computer for writing, web-surfing, video streaming, ext. then i would say go for it.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Chromebook 11- excellent build quality and phenomenal display", "Author": "Jeff Stong", "ReviewID": "R12NIPIKSLKWZY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Chromebook 11 for 2 weeks.  I struggled at first thinking that it was just a crippled laptop and that a brain dead x86 laptop running Chrome and Google cloud services was the same thing.I was wrong.I found that I was grabbing the Chromebook over my Nexus 7 and also my 13\" ultrabook.  The weight and display quality is just too much of a draw.  I agree with Cenile D. Mentia's review on the Processor- the machine would be faster with a Haswell chip but it would also probably gain 10 or more ounces and have a fan.  Once I got over the fact that I shouldn't leave more than about 8 windows open- I didn't have issues.  I suspect the issue is memory management in the OS and not the ARM architecture.  2GB of RAM for the OS should be plenty.  I'm confident Google will clean-up this issue.I look at this machine as the iPhone of Chromebooks.  What it does it does well.  It doesn't do everything.  If you are truly ready to kneel to Google and move to the Google ecosystem then this is a great machine to do it.  Give yourself a few days to adapt.  It's caused me to de-clutter how I work on my personal computing.  I don't have 4 major things running at once on the Chromebook while streaming Youtube and Netflix simultaneously- but who really needs that anyway.My only persistent gripe is the lack of SKYPE in Chrome.  I like the Outlook mail app more than Gmail- so if Microsoft is willing to support that in Chrome, hopefully SKYPE will come soon.  There's chatter on the web about Microsoft supporting SKYPE within the Outlook mail app which would be nice.Summary:- Gorgeous Build Quality- Well though-out- Not a Power User Laptop- but this isn't Chrome's place- Read about the Slimport capabilities- if you have a Nexus7, your adapters will work on that too.

I wanted him to have a laptop for school at school. He has a gaming desktop already and that is enough. He has an HP laptop too but it is too bulky to go into his backpack. This seemed like the perfect fit. I was correct. He has now recounted on a daily basis how helpful it is to have his own dedicated laptop for school at school. Their school has most of the curriculum online now and largely interfaces through Google docs for written assignments. He no longer needs to line up to share a laptop. Now it is just open his Chromebook and start working. He is getting homework assignments done at school during study session as well. I cannot think of a better way to spend $280.

As someone who makes their living writing, and needs to be online all the time, this Chromebook is my favorite ever. At first I was worried that I would be writing \"in the cloud\" and terrified I'd lose my work for clients. No need. I can download the work from Google Docs, OpenOffice app or the new QuickOffice and save it on my computer. My previous laptop was crashing often and would take 20 minutes to an hour to boot and open Word. I can close this in a cafe, drive home, open it up, and everything is right there.The keyboard is a dream, it's easy to use, the keys feel great and I can work for hours.  It's small and thin but doesn't feel cheap and I've had people comment on how amazing it looks. The display is one of my favorite elements, it's bright and makes everything look great. I've watched several tv shows on this to test it out and they look fantastic. I know sound, especially with such a small computer, is an issue, but this little computer sounds great. I use headphones all the time, but the sound comes up nicely under the keyboard.  I'm accustomed to Harmon Kardon speakers on my old laptop, and those have a great sound, but this Chromebook does the trick and never disappoints. I've now increased my productivity tenfold because I can open it up and just start working immediately. Love using Gmail and everything else, none of that was a new thing for me, so this is seamless. I want to get my mom one soon because she has problems with viruses and malware, and this is the solution I know.UPDATE: Prior to the first charger being recalled, I had to send back my computer to Google because it started working. It refused to even display a charge light even when it sat plugged in all day. I was sent a replacement, and then eventually got the new charger. The latest computer displayed the same behavior after sitting for several days without being used. Then randomly it started working again when I plugged it in. I have noted others commenting about the same problem on the Google boards. My fix is to be sure I keep it plugged in and charged when I decide not to use it for several days.

I have been a Mac user since 2002 personally and Windows professionally. I did not need to buy another MacBook and I have tried Windows 8 on 3 different budget laptops. The Chromebook I had last year seemed to work best for me when I wanted something other than an iPad to read and respond to email, catch up on social media, casual web surfing, and light writing in Google Docs.When I saw this new Chrombook 11 announced I thought it would be a great upgrade from the Samsung and it is, and it isn't.The design with the Google influence is great. I like the white plastic and rounded edges, much like the white MacBook I had years ago. The keyboard is great. Travel is perfect and it feels solid. The screen is amazing for a device in this price range. It is not a retina display but the blacks are rich, whites are bright, and I can read text easily - which is the most important thing really. Battery life so far seems fine for my needs and the micro USB charger is the perfect size to toss in a bag, I really hate the design of most laptop chargers, just too big to lug around. The track-pad works fine for me, some have said it is not great and it will never be as responsive as the glass on on a new MacBook Air but this is also over $700 cheaper. I am actually using an extra Apple Magic Mouse via Bluetooth and it works fine so far. The speakers are under the keyboard and are some of the best I have ever heard on a device of this size. You will not wake the neighbors but they don't distort and listening to music as I type this is actually a nice experience.The performance is average. I wish Google/HP would have bumped up the processor and memory. The 16GB of storage is fine since you store everything in the cloud anyway but you do see some lag watching videos full screen and web pages sometimes take a little longer to load than expected. I am also surprised the omitted an i/o for an SD card. There are decent, basic photo editors available and you can upload to Google Drive, Google+ or other sites. It's not a deal breaker but since the Samsung had it at a lower price point it should be here as well. Many have complained about USB 2.0 but I never took advantage of the 3.0 on the Samsung so again, not a deal breaker to me.All in all, this is a great buy. Its light, easy to type on, has a great screen, and will work well for my needs. That is the key thing to think about when buying a Chromebook, how it will work for you. If you already are comfortable with Google services and do not need traditional programs like MS Office and Photoshop you should be fine. I have actually started talking family members into Chromebooks when replacing old laptops because they only use them for web and email.HP is releasing another model this month with a 14\" screen which will start at $299 and include a better processor but the screen on the Chromebook 11 makes it the one for me.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent bang for your buck!!", "Author": "dtg755", "ReviewID": "R5N0TFDE8TF6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been toying with the idea of purchasing a Chromebook since Google first announced them, but I owned a laptop and thought it seems redundant to have both.

First and foremost, the build quality is incredible for this price point. There are no creaks or loose fitting items and it overall feels very Apple-esque in quality of build and material. Along those lines, the screen is amazing! I have played with last year's Samsung model and the screen on it looked like something you would get on a $250 computer. The screen on this Chromebook is incredible. The colors are rich, viewing angles are huge, and overall it is one of the best displays I've owned. Moving along, the keyboard is nearly perfect. I love chic-let keys, and this keyboard is the best I've used. The track pad isn't perfect, but it's a lot better than the one on my 4 year old Sony Vaio laptop. The speakers, which are hidden beneath the keyboard, are very good. They get extremely loud and stay clear throughout their volume range. Not much bass, but I wasn't expecting that.

This review covers the hardware itself, not Chrome OS.  Chrome OS is great, and I think it's a wonderful OS for home use.  In short, if you want a Chromebook, you can find a better device than this one.The biggest issue I found was that when I opened the lid after 30+ minutes of no use, the machine would turn back on, but the display wouldn't.  For example, if I had been previously listening to music when I closed the lid, the music would come back on, but the display would be totally off, even after opening & closing multiple times, pressing the brightness keys, or tapping the power button quickly.  Each time I would have to force shutdown the device and then power it back on, which was always a very slow startup.Another major issue was with the power charger.  This device uses a micro USB charger, which at first seems great because hey I have tons of Micro USB cords!  Maybe I could even charge my Chromebook in my car! Right? Wrong.  Unfortunately only the Chromebook's charger will work as normal micro USB chargers (e.g. for phones) are too \"low power\", as the message that pops up says when I plug it in.  Also, the physical connection itself is flimsy and janky.  Inexplicably, sometimes when I connected the charger the machine simply wouldn't charge... at all, with the indicator light remaining off.About me: I'm a software developer and I've been using computers since I was 10 years old.", "Date": "June 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worked really well for 3 weeks.", "Author": "skiqueen", "ReviewID": "R3JKWPGCHTUJ7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this Chromebook for work which requires use of web-based records.

This HP Chromebook merely offers, (for a hike in the price, Samsung can be gotten for $229. and I paid $275 for the HP), a brightness that is more like an Apple laptop, which has all the bells and whistles. The purpose for which I purchased this, was to upgrade on the picture/color, while passing on my baby: Samsung Chromebook onto one who was without anything, prior had been homeless, and now has a room with only a window, no TV privileges or state of the art toys to play with. There is cable in the house, so I decided to give her my Samsung. I personally would not have considered buying another 'upgraded' Chromebook, but her need prompted me.  I am pleased with my choice, and can't wait to give her (she's my 63 yr old cousin in another state..Maine) the Samsung, which I'd been so pleased to use. I now couldn't do without a computer of sorts, as one receives so much info from it. The ONLY thing I preferred on the Samsung, was the connecting cord. An EXCELLENT feature. There's was simply a small hole, which I stuck the cord in with ease, and it spun naturally no matter which way I laid on the couch, or which direction I moved. I didn't need to take care, that it might break. That was a great feature. This one (my only disappointment) has a connection cord more like a phone connecting cord...it's difficult to put in, and can break if not absolutely flat. The color on my new HP makes me so happy, especially when I am watching a movie. That's the only reason why this one is better. As far as aesthetics, I don't care to much about that. It would have been nice if they made a glowing keyword for the night so I could see what I was typing/texting in the dark. Other than the picture, which is so much more colorful, and does please me greatly, there is no other feature to warrant the upgraded price. I'm a bit disappointed, for a difference of approximately  $50.00 more, that more features couldn't have been offered for the extra money. The outside of the computer doesn't much matter to me. It's nice, (white and blue) but I was also happy with the silver. I hope this helps, it's all about the color of the screen.

So you really need the 3A charger, which they are replacing free (finally after 2+ months).I was very happy to get 12 free GoGo sessions. That was enough to nearly pay the cost of the unit, for me. I have already used 2 of those sessions. Not sure if it would have made sense, otherwise. The processor is probably slower than the new Windows 8 tablets with Bay Trail processors. Not sure if you'll get smooth video on this one. It's not available on flights, and there is not enough RAM in this unit 16 GB to keep movies. And no services let you put them onto jump drives. So it doesn't look like it will fill that need, and I have to watch movies on my Galaxy Tab 3 8-inch, which is a great solution. But when can I carry ONE device with me instead of 2 or more? Still waiting. Windows 8 does not have the apps I use on Android, and probably never will. I hate the weight and other issues with my iPad, such as lack of memory expansion. Perhaps the newer, dual-boot Android-Win8 devices will fill the void.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome laptop!!!", "Author": "steven02x", "ReviewID": "R1JVRI2RPIG50C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great lap top for your everyday things. browsing the web, youtube, listening to music, watching movies, email, social media, writing a report for school etc...its all here, there is no need to spend 500 to 1500 bucks on a laptop unless you are doing some hardcore graphics design, video editing, pro tools etc. everything you need is built in and runs smooth. computer is fast enough for what its made for. also, with the newest update there is a lot of off line apps now for the people that are worried about it only working while its connected to the internet. works fine off line from my experience. last but not least is the design. the thing looks awesome, its very attractive. it feels very sturdy and very comfortable to work on. keyboard and track pad are great and the sound that comes out of the key board sounds really good. the display is amazing for how little the device costs. its sharp, great color accuracy and very bright. overall a great laptop for everyday stuff. you wont regret buying it", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just Get One!", "Author": "Peacefrog", "ReviewID": "RV4AP48YSVTI2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The search for a notebook/ultrabook/laptop limits your choices to essentially Macs and Win machines.

Lots of cloud based apps that require Wi-Fi and just enough offline apps to meet most of our needs. I haven't had any Wi-Fi issues with this unit as others have reported. Lots of issues can affect Wi-Fi like the Wi-Fi antennae on router, router channels, interference and the Wi-Fi antennae on the Chromebook.

I have a macbook air and I decided to use only the chrome browser for one month.  I was able to do it easily, using google docs and other free web-apps.When looking at chromebooks, I was only considering the 11 inch ones.  I did not think I would ever prefer to grab a 14 inch 3lb chromebook over my 11 inch macbook air.  I compared the acer c720, hp 11, and samsung series 3.  Two factors made me choose the hp 11 chromebook.  1) The screen is amazing.  It is significantly better than the macbook air. The colors are rich and really pop.  I often have the chromebook hp 11 and my macbook side by side and you can really tell the difference.  2) micro USB charging.  I really like this as a concetp.  I have an Anker Astro E5 external battery that I carry in my bag to charge my phone.  I tried using it with the hp chromebook 11 and while it will not charge the hp 11 to 100 percent, it will keep it at its current charge for an extra 5 hours or so.  It is nice to take a small shoulder bag with my phone, chromebook, and an iPad if I want and never have to worry about finding a charger at Starbucks.Pros:Beautiful screenNice keyboardPretty good speakers from underneath the keyboardLight weight.Good looks.The cons:It's slow.  Web pages take a while to load.  Older processor and 2 gb of RAM is limiting.The track pad lags and your finger sticks to it.  It is not smooth like the pixel or the macbook air.The plastic casing creaks.In summary, as an intro to chrome OS, I am very happy.  I love technology and I enjoy learning of the new chrome OS features and getting to try them out each month.

I wasn't smart enough to do this when I bought the chromebook on impulse, and as a result a lot of my complaints could of been mitigated if I had done further research.I don't posses a strong hardware or consumer electronics knowledge, so I will not be making too many comparison to other products.What I like:The Chromebook 11 by most measures is aesthetically pleasing, light, and extremely portable.The speakers on this laptop are surprisingly loud and clear.The display is beautiful.  Fan boys of other products that cost 5-7x the cost make argue that the display isn't very good, but I believe they are comparing Apples to Filet Mingion.Since I already use a lot of Google products (gmail, calendar, google +, drive, etc), other web applications (Evernote, Workflowy, etc), and an Android Phone I found the chromebook to be extremely supportive of my work flow and is probably the overall reason why I use the Chromebook.Also the operating system turns on and off quickly which is a nice plus.Things That I Don't Like:If you are someone who has a lot of tabs open at once, you are going to hate yourself.  Since I am someone who generally has a lot of tabs open you can probably guess my frustration.  The problem is the more tabs you have open the slower each page loads.  I normally like to mass open 20-25 political articles and read for an hour or two, but Chromebook doesn't effectively allow me to do that.  Obviously there are simple ways to get around this, but it is still a slight nuisanceIf you plan on streaming something, don't plan on trying to do anything else.  If you are trying to watch Netflix or Hulu you can't do anything else.  It will cause the video to freeze.  I know watching Netflix/Hulu probably wasn't the intended user case for the machine, but as someone who likes to do both of those things, it is frustrating.  Similarly I have had connectivity issues with Amazon Prime's video service, which really annoys me too.Things I HATE about the Product:The BATTERY IS SO BAD.  The battery is awful and the charger is a big ole slap in the face.  This is the sole reason I wouldn't recommend this product.  I actually had the intention of buying 2 more of these Chromebooks for Mothers and Fathers day, but quickly realized I was better saving and just getting my parents ipads for their Birthdays.I genuinely hope the engineer that designed the charger was fired, because they were a moron to say the least.  The biggest problem with the charger is that the battery of the machine still drains while plugged in.  Meaning if you are working on something while you battery is low, you might try to plug your chromebook in and attempt to continue to work only to find yourself SOL.To effectively charge the chromebook it needs to be completely powered off.  Even then the charger doesn't charge very well.  For example last night before I slept my chromebook had 9% battery.  I powered it off and charged it and when I woke up 8 hours later it only had 77% battery (its like the charge is being generated via hamster wheel).  Similarly I used my chromebook unplugged for a hour after waking up and it dropped the battery down to 50%.  Even as I am writing this right now with my chromebook plugged in, I see the battery slowly dying on me.  I should note I currently have display brightness at lowest possible setting and the only application I have open is this one Google Chrome tab to write this review.Finally occasionally(probably a few times a day) you get the lovely 'low power charger connected' error which is really HP Chromebooks way of telling you 'hey don't count on me working for the next few hours'.  I have tried other micro usb chargers with no avail.Overall:Its a decent device and I still use everyday, but I would not buy it again.  In my humble opinion most people would not find this device useful. I would suggest that most people are probably better spent saving a little extra money and buying something better.  Frustration over the battery alone has probably raised my blood pressure, especially before I figured out that the battery was draining even while plugged in.As someone who is kind of a Google Fanboy, I am really disappointed to see that the company would associate itself which such a stupid battery/charger design.If this flaw was fixed I would easily rate this product higher and would feel more comfortable buying this as a gift for relatives and friends.", "Date": "May 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Doesn't Charge", "Author": "FDR", "ReviewID": "R33DEIMQKJ6OF1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Two weeks after owning this product, the charger has quit working.

Hipolito \"Occasional Book worm\"", "ReviewID": "R3JZSR668S0MNU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Initial Impressions:Build.This is my first Chromebook. The build itself is very stylish. Kinda surprising when the case is really made of plastic. I like that they put some kind of padding at the bottom and the color goes with the border thingie on the keyboard. It looks really clean and subdued. The keyboard has a nice feel to them. Reminds me of Macbook air.PerformanceIt's like automatic when I push the power button. I can close it and just pick up where I left off a few hours later. I noticed that it gets warm if I put it on a pillow. But its ok when you just carry it around or on your lap. I tend to open a lot of tabs and I noticed that battery life can take a hit if you do this. To be fair I had over a dozen tabs open most of the time and not having so much can improve battery life. The playback of videos from my Movies and TV library can be a little annoying though. When I'm watching and I accidentally touch the trackpad, just touch not click, the video seems to skip a little. So for the most part if I'm watching I leave it alone.The camera is horrible though, it looks like I'm always in a dark room even though I have ample lighting in the room. So when I chat with my mom who lives in Sydney, I use my tablet.AppsI'm trying to get used to how the apps work. For example, if I watch the movies of tv shows on my google TV or tablet, I have to use the play movies app. But here I have to remember to watch them via Youtube. I just hope they standardize it among google products. Not a big deal but a source of confusion for newbies.I hope google can entice more developers to develop more quality games. Most of the games are casual in nature so for the most part I go back to my Windows 7 pc to play (I like to consider myself a serios PC gamer).Summary:So far I'm happy with my purchase. Will update soon after a few more weeks.Update 10/20/2013The keyboard is not backlit so normally I just use the light from the screen to help me see the letters on the keyboard. Kinda primitive lol.The sound from the speaker is not bad at all. I must have lowered my expectations from some of the other reviews but its ok. However I noticed that if I use it as my \"radio\" it does take a decent drain battery wise. So use earphones when you can.I also found out that my old phone charger is of low power charger for the chromebook. So I now use the chromebook charger as my charger for tablet and phone as well.Also when you lie in bed and you use the chrmebook, the screen doesn't swivel as much as ordinary laptops. So you'll need a pillow to prop up your head (I normally rest it against my lap but I usually have my legs folded up so I open the chromebook as much as I can and use  pillow). It's not a big deal but it's one of those things you notice.I have to say that the no hard angles approach work for me. It's just good to look at.All in all its just minor things that I was used to with my old laptop.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best little laptop on the market", "Author": "Fitnessdad.com", "ReviewID": "R3SH4JCZDDGNKB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this chromebook more than my Microsoft laptop.
