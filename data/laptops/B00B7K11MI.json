{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Everything I want and need for a great price", "Author": "Robert Haven", "ReviewID": "R2H9PD6EEM7PRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a review of the Asus laptop, not Windows 8.  I'm a retired computer professional and I've had over a dozen different laptops over the years, from economy models to the top-of-the-line (so I have a large frame of reference).  I'm really pleased with this laptop -- it's a great value and I really don't need any more power or features for what I do these days.  I use it mostly for web browsing, Office apps (Word, Excel, Outlook, Powerpoint), Photoshop, iTunes management of a huge music library, and email.  I'm \"on my computer\" over 8 hours a day.  For those purposes, this laptop is serving me well at a great price.  I looked at a lot of others in the same price range and decided on this one for these reasons:  a good processor (I don't think I saw any faster ones in this price range), 500GB disk drive (I really don't need more space and I have larger external USB drives if I ever do), a decent integrated graphics adapter, 3 USB ports including USB 3.0, an HDMI port, VGA output for non-digital TVs and monitors (not found on many current laptops but it's still useful), DVD burner, a pretty long battery life, and a 1-year warranty on accidental drops and spills.When I first started using the laptop, I was very impressed by the feel and the action of the keyboard and the brightness and clarity of the 15.6\" screen.  I was also pleased that it wasn't pre-loaded with a bunch of free-trial crap software (all I got rid of was the 30-day(?) free-trial McAfee anti-virus, which I replaced with AVG free edition). I added 4GB of Kingston memory for a total of 8GB RAM and so far I have no complaints about performance.  (Some buyers may want to know that the disk drive is formatted with C and D partitions, 186 GB and 258 GB in size, respectively. That's smart, but I wonder if non-technical users will ever even access and use the large D partition since all user files (My Documents, etc.), by default, are put on the C partition.  On the D drive, I put all my music files, my thousands of digital photos, and other large data collections which I don't need to frequently access via the convenient user folders (My Documents, My Pictures, etc.).  I think there's an additional recovery partition, but it doesn't appear in the file manager.I have only a couple complaints.  The left/right buttons at the bottom of the touchpad take a lot of pressure to make them click (probably intentional to avoid accidental clicking) and I don't like the feel of their action.  I thought maybe I'd stop using a mouse and switch to using the touchpad only, but the feel of those buttons caused me to go back to my mouse within a few hours of use.  The other complaint is that there's no LED indicator when Caps Lock or Numeric Lock is enabled on the keyboard, but that's a pretty minor issue.  (UPDATE:  I just discovered there *are* LEDs for Caps and Numeric lock -- they are small green LEDs on the front left edge, next to some other LEDs like the disk activity LED).So, I'm very pleased with this laptop and I think it's a tremendous value in its price range.  No regrets on this purchase! Windows 8 is a different story and I'm not crazy about it, but I'm learning to adjust.  I would prefer to have Windows 7 which was the best Windows OS to date.  Windows 8 is not nearly as bad as many reviewers would have you believe. By creating my user account as a 'local user', ignoring the Start Screen that looks like a smart phone and only using the Windows desktop, it's very much like using Windows 7.  You just have to find where they hid some things like the Start Menu (use Windows key + X combination).  And so far, all the software I have (some of which is pretty old, like Office 2003), has installed without compatibility problems.  I almost paid much more to get a laptop with Windows 7 instead of 8, based on all the negative comments, but I'm glad I didn't do that.

It does it all, more than I expected after a few weeks of owning it.This laptop is fast. It's fast booting up, shutting down, loading programs, buffering videos, downloading, etc. Never had a problem. All the features: IceCool palm rests, SuperBatt Tech, InstantOn, and 5% AutoBackup work great. The InstantOn is my favorite, my other laptops and desktops are nowhere near as fast booting up and shutting off. The laptop will boot up to the start screen as long as it takes for you to sip a cup of coffee.Win8 gets getting used to, many people like to complain about changes, but I have no major complaints. The only complaint I have is I was disappointed that there's no Microsoft Office installed. When I had to do work I was prompted to buy a CD key, not what I expected.What I love the most is the gaming power of this laptop. You wouldn't expect much from an entry level priced laptop, but I'm playing Shogun 2 Total War on medium smoothly. With that being said, I'm already starting to fill up my hard drive downloading Steam games!", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer, slightly flawed touchpad, terrible OS", "Author": "John Laden", "ReviewID": "R1WOEW454HYA6M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The computer itself feels very sturdy and well-built. However, I noticed it does not lock when you close it. I personally don't mind, but some people might. Also, the mousepad could have been better. Instead of being one pad above two separate buttons, it's a left/right button and touchpad integrated into one large surface that you must click from the bottom or middle left. It feels uncomfortable and cheap, and misclicks quite often. I highly recommend getting a wireless mouse and disabling the touchpad.Windows 8 is also another headache. Microsoft seems to always do this with their operating systems: they release an outstanding operating system one year, and then a flop of an OS the next year. Since Windows 7 was such a great operating system, perhaps they decided it was time for another failure OS. Windows 8 tries to turn a laptop into a tablet or phone, but the concept doesn't work if you want to get real work done (ie - typing reports and writing e-mails, as opposed to browsing facebooks and playing with apps). Essentially, think of a laptop with Windows 8 as a giant keyboard phone (that can't make calls) with a desktop \"app\" that you must click to open every time. In order to make Windows 8 more useable, you must install (and in some cases buy) several third-party programs such as the start button and metroUI deactivator, among other things. I would prefer a laptop to be useable right out of the box, without having to buy something as basic as the start menu.That's not to say that Windows 8 prevents you from doing work; you can still do work, but it almost seems like the desktop setup was added in later as an afterthought, with the phone-like metroUI being at the forefront. It gets annoying having to always slide a page up just to login, then click a tile on the metroUI to access the desktop, every single time you open the computer. Windows 8 focuses too much on facebook and useless apps, and not enough on productivity. It is too easy to access apps I will never use, and too slow to resume work programs. Worst of all, you cannot disable these annoying \"features\" without installing/buying third party programs on your brand new computer. As a full-time college student juggling school and a demanding job, I want to be able to write lecture notes, close the screen when lecture ends, open it to write an e-mail quickly between classes, then go to the next class and resume writing lecture notes, with minimal time and effort. Windows 8 make it so that I must pull an unnecessary login screen up as if it were a tablet/phone, go to the metroUI, and click the desktop tile every single time I want to resume my work. It gets old fast.Combine the cheap trackpad and Windows 8 (which relies so heavily on trackpad gestures from a laptop for some ungodly reason) and you get a rather frustrating experience for the average user. I would not recommend Win8 for anyone who expects to write more reports/essays/e-mails than facebook posts. For the price point, the laptop is a good deal, but it could have been so much better with windows 7 and a proper touchpad. If you plan on getting this laptop add in the cost of a portable mouse and make sure you have a copy of Linux/Win7 on hand. If you do not know how to install a new OS, or can't get someone to do it for you, consider a laptop with Win7. There are still a few out there.Laptop: 4/5Win8: 2/5", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Nitin N", "ReviewID": "R130IB88566NUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this computer for a couple days and so far it's been excellent. Out of the box it takes about 15-20 minutes to get it up and running, with absolutely no problems. I use it for light computing, watching videos on youtube/netflix and will be using it for some gaming pretty soon. Having read some reviews of the hardware components and benchmark reviews, it appears to handle older games fairly well, and even some of the new ones which are non-graphics intensive quite decently (think Starcraft II).Pros:-Pretty speedy processor-Pretty good video card-Memory upgradeable-Numpad included, something a lot of laptops don't have-Stays cool, stays quiet-Quite sturdy-According to a study of laptop reliability ratings, Asus had the lowest 3-year failure rate, so that's promising-Can't really be beat at the price point for the performance you getCons:-The touchpad is a little sensitive, be sure to go into settings and adjust it accordingly-~450 GB of hard drive space, the OS and factory settings alone take ~30 GB, so you are left with 420 GB-I do wish the warranty was 2-years, if Asus is that reliable they should be confident in the robustness of their products-Screen brightness is a little inconsistent-If the charger is flush with the side of the laptop, it blocks the cd/dvd drive from opening, which is a bit of design fail on thepart of Asus.Other:Before purchasing this laptop I saw that quite a lot of the reviews lamented that it comes with Windows 8, but for $3-5, you can easily avoid the 'smartphone' layout of Windows 8 by getting a start menu program (startisback or start8). I have startisback on my computer and now it looks like windows 7.Final thoughts:I have only owned this computer for a few days, so it's probable that I have not discovered every nook/cranny/caveat/pitfall that comes with this laptop, but hopefully I was thorough enough in helping you guys out to make a decision. In my opinion, the pros outweigh the cons, because the cons are very easy to fix. I don't think Windows 8 is a 'con', despite the fact that I personally don't like it. Try it out for yourself, you may find it anywhere from convenient/amazing to awful.4.5/5 --- A lot of hits, a few misses, overall a very reasonably priced, efficient computer", "Date": "May 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value, no bloatware, high reliability, but weird touchpad", "Author": "Alexander", "ReviewID": "RRB6WEG2I1E4W", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I recently bought a high-end HP laptop and also purchased this ASUS laptop (both from a sources other than Amazon).  If I compare the two the HP was about 3 times the price but had a very fast i7 processor with high end graphics and a large disk and and RAM.  The ASUS has a low end quad core processor, mid range graphics, less ram and smaller disk.  But otherwise the machines have similar specs:  same screen size, number and type of USB ports, HDMI & VGA, DVD burner, and card reader.Why compare them you ask?  What I am really comparing is the experience of buying an HP (a market leader) vs ASUS (a less known brand).That is all background, now the interesting part:* ASUS is rated highest reliability after 3 years while HP is rated worst.  See Ton's Hardware for a nice chart.* The ASUS does have a weird touch pad - as others have mentioned.  This is the 2nd ASUS laptop that I have purchased and the both had unusual and/or confusing touch pads or mouse buttons.  This new machine's touch pad suffers from sensitivity issues and also from the strange design of only having a single physical switch under the pad which means to click easily, you need to be near the center of the pad.  But to determine if it is a right or left click, ASUS uses the location of your finger on the touch pad at the time of the click.  Clever design idea but irritating to use.  I normally use a wireless mouse so this is not a deal killer for me.  ASUS, if you are reading this, just go with a normal touch pad with normal top mounted buttons that are not too stiff.  Then you won't stand out in a bad way.* The ASUS is usable right out of the box (assuming you can stomach Win 8).  It has not bloatware like an HP and also comes with Win 8 straight, not the handicapped Win 8 Home version that HP uses.  This is a huge plus for me.* Finally, the display is better on the ASUS.  Both displays are the same resolution and size.  But HP uses a really cheap LCD panel that has poor contrast.  The ASUS is better for contrast which makes text more readable.  This is also a huge plus.So whats the net-net?  From now on when I shop for to new laptop, I will look to ASUS first and won't even consider HP (given their poor reliability ratings, bloatware, and poor readability displays).  But I will also pay attention to the touch pad and the mouse buttons when looking at ASUS in the future given their proclivity of wandering of the tried and true path in this area.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "There is no better deal for the price.", "Author": "Enti", "ReviewID": "R3AHFJIIMWKILR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First let me say I did a LOT of research on the market before buying this laptop.

We need something that will allow us to access the internet, send and receive email, listen to some music, maybe run a finance program, look at Facebook... We're not exactly taxing our devices at home. Unless you're a hardcore gamer. If you're a big gamer, this is probably not for you. One might wonder why gamers are playing on laptops in the first place. But I digress...This is, in my opinion, a perfect balance between a more expensive laptop, and a less feature-rich notebook. Compact and relatively light, a good sized screen, a standard keyboard (with a 10-key pad, which is important to some of us), an optical drive, USB 3.0 ports, and HDMI port... it's pretty much everything you'll need for typical home use. Graphics are good, but not mind-blowing. Speed is decent, even with a 5400 rpm hard drive, but not blazing. I'd recommend upgrading the memory with another 4GB, as it does get a little bogged down if you're multitasking. (Memory is dirt cheap these days. I remember paying upwards of $100 for 128mb of RAM. I got 4GB for about $30. Crazy.)Also nice is that, unlike many of the other manufacturers, ASUS didn't see the need to install a bunch of useless bloatware. Saved me a ton of time not having to uninstall it.A couple of minor gripes: battery life isn't terribly long, I get about 3 hours with moderate to semi-heavy use; build quality feels a little cheap, being made entirely of plastic; the textured plastic is a fingerprint magnet; and the keyboard is a bit mushy. All in all, though, I like this better than the HP ProBook it's replacing.I'd recommend this for typical home use, or for students. If you need advanced graphics capabilities (graphic design, gaming, etc.) I'd keep looking, but plan on spending a lot more.A quick note about Windows 8: All the whining about it may have lowered my expectations going in, but it's really not that bad, people. With the exception of lacking a start button, and the weird tile start screen, you can pretty much set it up to operate just like Windows 7. And if a start button is that important to you, there are 3rd party apps that can be had relatively cheaply to add one.

This isn't the cheapest laptop for the specs, but it is one of the most reliable and sturdy laptops for this price.  Asus has one of the highest customer satisfaction ratings for a reason: they're not cheap and they know computers.Before this Asus laptop I've owned three HP laptops, a Dell laptop, and a Samsung laptop.  The worst by far was the Dell, but the HP laptops followed pretty close behind.  HP has a lot of design flaws and by design flaws I mean they don't seem to consider heating and cooling the way they should.  My last HP laptop fried a wireless mouse USB and actually melted plastic inside the laptop before the bearings on the fan gave out and fried the whole laptop.Asus is one of the most trusted brands for laptops according to a multitude of sources.  Tied with Toshiba with the least amount of malfunctions within the first 3 years of owning, Asus makes a strong product that you can bank on.  Since Toshiba is usually more expensive for the same specs, I'd suggest sticking with Asus or Lenovo if you want something that you can rely on.This particular computer is a really sleek and fancy looking computer.

I purchased a cheap, external mouse (the digital mouse cost me under $7), because the machine's touchpad seemed awful to me.  The results were usually frustrating (from closing windows unexpectedly, to resizing or altering the screen at a hair's breath!)  The purchased mouse works beautifully through the usb 2.0 port.2. I purchased a usb 2.0 hub (about $12) to extend the number of usb devices I could use at once (external hard drive, ipod charger, etc.)  I purchased this hub because (at least initially, I seemed unable to push the usb 2.0 device into the two usb 3.0 ports on the left of the machine.  I discovered later that I could do so, with a firmer push into the 3.0 port).  So this issue also turned out o.k.Once I resolved these two problems, I found that this laptop was a joy to use!  This, for several reasons:1. The machine is fast and smooth.  I have no complaints about opening many progams at once.2. It not only gives you a 186 gig C-drive, but it also gives you a D-drive of 258 gigs.  On the D-drive, i can then store a bunch of media and files, with really free space to burn.3. The screen is quite large and bright, with very good resolution.4. The keyboard is expansive and complete, with all the usual keys and buttons, which are big and easy to use.  The numbers pad is excellent, and the home, end, pgup/dn keys are located in a good place, at the top of the numbers keypad.  I do have one observation: Look for the cap and numbers-on indicator lights in the front-left of the laptop base, as the two right-most lights.  Otherwise, you will think that there are no indicator lights for these functions.  This is an interesting and actually excellent place to put these lights.5.

Not too glitchy on heavy loading and doesn't seem to want to lock up on you and if it does it will only be a minute at most before it frees back up (I did some HEAVY downloading and installing to bring it back to par with my old computer)  Simply its great for a budget buy who also wants a good look and a quick responsive computer.Cons: If you are a gamer.... DO NOT GET THIS LAPTOP the graphics card isn't built for it.  Its confusing if you don't know Windows 8.  Comes with a low end quad core processor which a slightly better dual core would work a lot better.  The touch pad is like a knock off design of the Apple Mac books touch pad just with a right click button. As far as more cons I'll update in the future when I've messed around with it more.Special notes and considerations:  I recommend getting a second 4Gb DDR3 (PC3) RAM card along with this laptop because that extra boost in RAM makes all the difference with how much it stops up and acts sketchy on you at certain heavy usage points.  Buy a mouse if you are curious if your going to like the touch pad or not I know I'm going to here soon.  And don't expect a super computer out of a small price but it is actually really good for the price.Thanks for reading and I hope this helps some of you in your decision.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good laptop even for a low price.", "Author": "Ryan Grobe", "ReviewID": "R3O8AD4D5V36KS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK first and foremost I am not an Amazon verified purchaser of this laptop, I bought it at a local Best Buy on clearance for under $400. It was the Windows 7 model and after almost a year of ownership, this laptop still operates well even after an upgrade to Windows 8 Pro.The pros of this laptop are in abundance when it comes to hardware specs, reliability, and overall usability. I bought this laptop for school purposes and it has done it's job well. The AMD APU that comes with it is very responsive even for a low clock speed of 1.9 GHz. Since this laptop has limited Hard Drive space I have been using Microsoft Skydrive and external drives to store my data. The RAM is more than most laptops at the price I bought it for but for some of the applications I run it wasn't enough. However one thing that does surprise me is that this laptop can take a hit. I am usually very careful with anything I buy for more than a hundred dollars but this has been subject to a year's worth of abuse in the hands of high school student. Now the keyboard is probably one of the most important aspect of this PC. It is easy to type on and isn't too loud even when I hit the keys hard. It is great for Word and PowerPoint as well since I use those two programs the most other than Google Chrome. This PC has the hardware and durability to be a nice homework machine but it can also run Battlefield 3, to my surprise, on low to mid settings.With every good machine there are always some issues you shall experience down the road. The cons of this laptop are the battery mainly, even on the recommended and power saving power plans I noticed my battery to drain rather fast after about 6 months of use. Also it crashed on me once when I tried to load of Word and do an assignment, this was easily fixed though but I was still worried about the cause of the crash. Another con of the laptop is the cooling system, it appears to be good with the way the board is designed to match up with the APU and keep it cool. However if you plug the laptop into a wall outlet the AMD built APU takes the meaning of the word accelerated to heart thanks to the AMD Vision Engine Control center that ramps up the clock speed from 1.9 to 2.8 GHz. This makes the laptop reach temps at 50 degrees Celsius or higher.After taking in the accounts of the positives and the negatives this is still a very good laptop, even for it being a year old at the time of writing this.

The circle of points indicator was no longer visible, the mouse and keyboard were unresponsive, and I couldn't shut the computer off, the usual way.  This went on for more than an hour which was enough time to convince me that nothing good was going to happen if things continued the same way.  So I decided to use the \"cold shutdown\" which is pushing the start button and holding it down for approximately 20 seconds until the computer unfroze and stopped. Then I waited for about 20 or 30 more seconds and then pushed the start button again.

The UEFI stuff made it a huge pain - apparently the way the UEFI stuff is implemented on this computer is even worse than many other Windows 8 computers. It took forever to finally get Ubuntu installed, and once I did, Windows stopped working. Even now, once in a while the computer won't wake up from resume, etc. - I suspect that it is all related to the BIOS problems.I'm hoping to figure out a way to just remove Win8 and install Ubuntu on the whole drive, but trying to get it to work has been as tricky the second time around as it was the first.Basically, if you are planning to use Linux, I would buy a different computer.", "Date": "October 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Product Satisfied My Needs", "Author": "Rebecca Jackson", "ReviewID": "R2HDCKWTUN21U6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop is fast, speedy, and it suits all of my complicated needs. As a writer for both songs and novels, I was pleased that the laptop, though it did not necessarily come with all the tools I needed, did, in fact, make it easy to download anything I could want. The only issue I have with the product is that it uses Windows 8, which is meant to be touch-screen and the computer is not.

It arrived in excellent condition with all included pieces parts.  Since this laptop has Win8 installed, I really wanted 8 Gb of RAM so I ordered an extra 4 Gb SIM chip.  Very easy to install.  A small Phillips screwdriver was necessary. Also, you did need access the BIOS upon booting up, save and exit , F10, to get the PC to recognize the additional chip.I was concerned about a few things at the time of ordering.  How hot would the unit get after ru\u00f1ning for awhile?  The speed since it was only 1.9 Ghz?  The screen as a couple reviewers commented on it having poor viewing angles.  Volume most laptops have poor speakers.  Thankfully, I am quite pleased with the performance overall.  None of these concerns are concerns today.  We have had the unit nearly a month and it is getting used daily.The laptop boots quite fast, and brags a 5 sec. wake time.  I haven't bothered to put a stop watch on it.  However, it wakes from sleep or hibernate amazingly.  Battery life is definitely in the 4 plus hour range.  The screen is big at 15.6 and the clarity, color, viewing angles, etc all exceed expectations.  Speakers may not be loud enough for some people, but again they exceeded my expectations.  I have only engaged the camera once to ensure it was in working order, and it is.  The camera was a must, but is still considered a bonus accessory.  It will get used occasionally with Skype or other app but will get limited use.  Have not burned DVD, but have watched a movie and performs well.This was purchased for our daughter to take to college this fall.  She is also pleased with it thus farm, and we are confident it will meet her needs over the next 4 years plus.  Oh, she has been happy that chose Win8.  This does not have a touch screen, she knew that at the time we ordered it, and it is working out just fine.
