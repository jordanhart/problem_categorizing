{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Long time Lenovo fan disapointed", "Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "R18RI16PWM4UBU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The next gen X1 Carbon is sleek and fast system with an amazing display - it's two steps forward and one step back for the platform.  The first problem is they messed with the keyboard - and the touch point.While the liquid crystal display for the function keys seems like a great idea, in practice it's awful for touch typing, The switch key is right next to the escape key, and because the switch key for the LCD function key is a touch key, brushing that key while you are access the ESC key mean that LCD function keys will have change their function. Meaning the next time you reach for F2 to change a file name, or F4 to repeat a change, you will change the volume or some other unintended result. Now you have stop, look at the function pad, see that what mode it's in and change mode back to function key mode and proceed, every time you access the function key row. In the OLD world, with the Fn key, you could press two key at the same time (one effective key stroke) to change the screen brightness, turn on the keyboard light etc. Now it take some random interval between one, if you are in the right function mode, to three to scroll through the function key modes to get to the right key pad. I used to be a brain surgeon with a laser scalpel with the X series now Lenovo has just handed me an blunt axe.The LCD function key pad is just annoying however and I could probably learn to slow down and look at the LCD pad to see what mode it was in and toggle through the modes to get the one that I wanted. Even though the Fx key are used 95% of the time. The other fluffily keys not so much. However they did the forgivable, they messed with my beloved Touch Point. They took away the tactile REAL left and right mouse keys and replaced them with a touch sensitive pad. The virtual touch areas are not definite enough, and I can't find the right mouse key without looking for it, once I have found it, it takes much more physical force to make it right key click because you have depress the that corner of the keypad, rather than the mouse key that had the same spring tension as the keyboard key. I want a real mouse key, that is light, tactile and responsive. Clearly they did not ask Touch Point users to test this system.The rest of the platform is brilliant - you could say they turned the X1 into an Apple Mac from an design standpoint - and that is good and bad. However, if I wanted a Mac I would have bought one. I wanted the best keyboard that human kind had ever touched, with keys just the right spacing and key spring weight. With a touch point that I don't have to stop and take my hands from the keyboard to use. They broke that and now I will have to return my Limited Offer \"20A70037US\" Next Gen Carbon X1.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "This will be my last Thinkpad if they don't bring back the physical mouse buttons.", "Author": "Henry", "ReviewID": "RVMEHWAJWOQ02", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been a Thinkpad user for almost 20 years and one of the main reasons for sticking with them is the trackpoint and the placement of the mouse buttons. It makes the laptop very useable while traveling or when getting stuck in a tight space on a plane. However, when they integrated the buttons into the touch pad, it become uncomfortable since you have to apply extra force to click a button.I never like touchpads so I disabled it as soon as I got the laptop. As a side note, if you only disable it in Windows, it only applies to your login, meaning that it becomes enabled when you're at the login screen. So you need to disable touchpad in the BIOS instead.Back to mouse buttons. Now the margin of error increases since 3/4 of the touchpad represents the left button. If you rest your palm while typing, you're going to have a high chance of touching it by accident. It's just not a pleasant experience.Now let's talk about the keyboard, it's still very comfortable to type on. But I don't know who made the decision to change the layout - The caplock key splits into Home and End keys. And the Backspace key splits into a Backspace key and a Delete key. The function keys now become a row of touch-sensitive dynamic keys. This makes the life harder for those of us who rely heavily on the keyboard. e.g. If you want to do Alt-F4 to close a window, you need to make sure that the soft keys are showing the functions keys or you won't have a F4 button to hit. So what about the volume and brightness? Well, it's not there if you're using function keys. It's in another set of soft keys!I got the touch version simply because that's the only way to get the 2560x1440 screen. It's a laptop no matter how you try to convince others otherwise. I'd not want to have smudges on the screen by swiping my fingers on it. But then it doesn't impede how I use my laptop so I'm not going to complain about it.Overall, it's just not a good initial impression.4/29/2014 -Here's an update of how things are going with this laptop after using it for almost 2 months:The good:- Still loving the screen, the weight and the CPU performance.The bad:- Adaptive keyboards just DON'T WORK. They're not responsive and you don't always get the keys you want without cycling through the soft keys. The fact that volume control keys are soft keys means that if you play some video/music that's unexpectedly loud, you might have to scramble to mute it. First you need to check if it's in the soft keys. If not, cycle to the one with volume control and mute it. Besides, volume keys don't work always work for some reason and sometimes you need to click on another window before you can change the volume. Seriously?!?- No alt-printscr. Yes, there's this snipping tool but again it's in one of the soft keys. And yes, there's this Alt-Fn-T shortcut, but it's capturing the whole screen instead of a window.- Touchpad buttons don't work well for trackpoint users. If you're a trackpoint user, your thumb would naturally be resting near the middle button area. If you need to left click, you move your thumb a little bit to the left and click. But since these buttons are all integrated into the touchpad, the accuracy decreases significantly - meaning that you don't always get the button click that you want. I don't know how many times that I wanted a right click and got a left click, or a right click but got a middle button instead.- Backspace/delete keys. I don't mishit these keys now, mainly because I'm making conscious effort to avoid the mistake or I would have deleted something without knowing it. Still totally unacceptable to change the keyboard layout like this.- Caps lock when double-tapping the shift key. I thought it was okay but in reality it's activated unknowingly when I'm organizing a folder of files using shift-right-click.The verdict remains the same. I will NOT buy another Thinkpad with this ridiculous keyboard/trackpad design.", "Date": "March 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Stay Away - Fried and Died in Just 55 Days", "Author": "More Sanity \"sjones1370\"", "ReviewID": "R1G775OVHEQBQ0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a power windows user and have been looking for a light weight Ultrabook comparable to the MacBook Pro that I could use as a near desktop replacement.  Given how rave the reviews are for the MacBook Pro, it has been harder and harder to justify not switching to the MBP, but who has time to learn all the nuances of the Mac and I use a lot of Excel and QuickBooks, which don't play nice with Mac.  Thus, I was very excited to learn about this computer.  Its actually lighter than the MacBook Pro and comparable in most respects except the screen is a little lower Res.  I ordered one of the first Models with the 500 GB Solid State Drive in late Feb.  I got it March 14th and it completely died on May 8th - 55 days start to finish for a $2,400 computer (with all the bells and whistles).  Sorry Lenovo, but I expect better than this.Apparently, it failed to turn itself off after I turned it off and left my office one night and it got too hot.  This is interesting, because I have left it on all night before with no problems.  In fact, I have been impressed at how little heat it generates while operating.  When I got there in the morning, it was non-responsive .  I was able to finally turn it off by unplugging it and holding the off button for a long time.  After letting it cool down, I turned it on again, but the whole thing shorted out and it is now completely dead - totally non-responsive, except the keyboard backlights are flashing at me every 3 seconds.  Definitely a short of some kind.I always buy Lenovo's premium on-site warranty that guarantees on site service within 24 hours,  However, much to my Chagrin, Lenovo was unable to get someone here.  Thus, I would give this Computer and Lenovo's Warranty Service Negative five stars if I could.  I have been a dedicated Think Pad user for 20 years and the quality has definitely gone down since Lenovo bought the business.  This is the straw that broke the Camel's back for me.  I am heading over to the Apple Store to do what I should have done originally.  I have friends with Mac Books that are seven years old and they have never had problems.  I haven't gotten more than three years from a ThinkPad in a long time.Incidentally, I was talking to the Lenovo Warranty Dept today and they said they are starting to get a lot of calls on these.  I would stay away.  Its not worth the frustration.By the way, I also completely agree with the other reviewers.  The Keyboard is huge giant step backwards.  If you still buy this computer after reading this review, be advised that you will be really frustrated unless you have an external keyboard.  The slightest touch on the adaptive keyboard sends you into Adaptive Keyboard hell and destroys your productivity. and putting the end and back keys where the cap locks key used to be is just stupid.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed.

The touchpad clearly takes getting used to compared to a MacBook, but it's very workable.

The keyboard is different from the historical ThinkPads, but it is very nice nonetheless.  The screen is very high resolution, which makes for pretty small text/icons, etc., but it is so clear and sharp that it is not generally a problem.The touchpad is unique (at least in my experience), and is very user-friendly.  The entire pad rocks right and left - no \"mouse buttons\" just tap one side or the other for right and left mouse clicks.Hooked up with a port replicator it easily handles multiple displays and anything else thrown at it.The real stories, though, are how tiny it is, but how incredibly powerful.
