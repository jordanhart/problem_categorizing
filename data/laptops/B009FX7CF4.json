{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Love it, so far... Windows 8 takes getting used to", "Author": "Stacey", "ReviewID": "R2R4QUPOD5AYIU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just received this today so I may post a follow up review later.My first impression was that it was huge.  It's thicker and heavier than I expected but for the price point it's to be expected.  I don't plan to travel too often with it so it's not a huge concern to me.  Setup with windows 8 is unbelievably simple and makes it quick to get up and running.  I'm not a fan of the new Metro start screen.  I tried to customize it but it still just took up way too much space for my liking.  So I ended up downloading a free app, called classic shell that brought back the start menu functionality for me.  I think the laptop (which is what we are actually reviewing here - not windows 8) is quite peppy and the specs are more than adequate for any average user.  If you primarily use your computer for homework, email, web surfing, etc this will be great.  If you're a heavy gamer you probably want something else.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell inspiron with windows 8", "Author": "Miguel", "ReviewID": "R1WDMGN11U06Q8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am using this new laptop every day and is really amazing, they new operative system windows 8 create the perfect enviroment to work without any problem", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "MY DELL", "Author": "Arlene \"Arlene\"", "ReviewID": "R39JZ12QIC6ZZW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A VERY NICE LAPTOP AND VERY FAST.

The size, weight and Windows 8 Operating System are fine. However, they have a defect in the sensitivity of the mouse. It causes the curser to skip all over the place. You will be typing an email and it will suddenly skip to the middle of another sentence or paragraph or even better delete the document or email all together. It is all random and at first I thought it was me, then maybe just a weird defect. I sent the brand new Laptop back to Amazon, who promptly sent me another new one. The same thing started again after about 2 weeks. I contacted Dell support, in India. After about 30 minutes on the phone and remote access to remedy the issue they told me that I would need to purchase a $289 \"Software Warranty\" to correct the problem. I was told I must have downloaded something that corrupted the Mouse File. Seriously, are you kidding! On both brand new laptops? I had not even put my personal documents on the system yet. And certainly did not download anything. All I had done was surf the net on some basic websites like Amazon and Target!I have returned the second one and was refunded my money. I ordered a Samsung Chromebook, $150 dollars cheaper and looks like it is going to be a much better laptop. Do not purchase this item. I have no idea how it got good reviews? If it had not happened with two different new laptops I could have understood but this is definitely a defect in the computer.", "Date": "April 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Dome", "ReviewID": "R3PUSNIE3C500S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave it 5 stars because I really love it! This laptop is really fast and it absolutely overcame my expectations. The price is an opportunity and if you need a laptop for typical uses (word, web surfing, etc) I really would recommend this one. The only bad thing that I am going to say is that Windows 8 takes some time to get use to, I don't believe that it is horrible but it is a big change... But overall I am pretty happy with my purchase.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Really 5 stars for price meets quality", "Author": "the J man", "ReviewID": "R3QQRD8SNNA0CN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will try to make this short and sweet.  All drivers etc loaded right up in about 15-20 minutes.  Disc drive played anything I put in it strait off. Beautiful large screen.  This is a good laptop for home media purposes.  3-4 star keyboard.  Great track pad with scroll and pinch.  Track buttons are a little soft, but not much of a setback, especially if you're a tapper.  Nice material/finish/construction for the price. I think it has a solid feel to it.  Very fast start up and shutdown (surprised me).  Great processing speed.  I've used it for: browsing, streaming, hulu, youtube and most importantly the Photoshop cs6 cloud.  Photoshop runs just fine on this inspiron, and only bogged up when I had 4 or 5 images open at once.So strengths are: Screen.  Processing.  Price.  And audio: really good sound, even just through the onboard speakers.Only weakness really is that it is a bit big/bulky for a laptop.  So I guess that's the trade off for a low priced, good running machine.Ps - windows 8 isn't so bad.  kinda fun.  Just takes a day or three and you have it figured out.", "Date": "February 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent", "Author": "AlessandraCo \"Alessandra\"", "ReviewID": "R2C8IGLGEWLWQC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First impressions:Feels lighter than I expected. I'd be okay with it having been slightly heavier if it would have made it feel like a higher quality machine; feels UBER plasticky.One thing I have an issue with--and I will bring this up to Amazon--is that the ad says it's a 2.6 processor, yet the box says 2.2. That's extremely frustrating considering the processor is a primary component I was strongly considering in whatever pc purchase I made.Keyboard is responsive with hand placement being pretty much where I like it. The ctrl key isn't where I'm used to but, no big deal. As a first time Windows 8 user, so far so good. I actually like it.I do like the screen size; can't go wrong with the large display. Perhaps it just seems large to me since my Mac Air is 13 inches.Overall I understand that we spent $400-ish, not $800+, for this computer so i'm fairly satisfied. I don't know how Amazon will resolve the mistake they made by advertising this machine with the incorrect processor power. Other than that, I think i'll enjoy this computerUPDATE: Amazon was more than willing to exchange the pc for me. Overall this purchase is definitely a worthwhile one.", "Date": "February 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "More than disappointing", "Author": "APQQH", "ReviewID": "RM086UPQFW8F4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the first month I had the computer it seemed to work fine. I did not like Windows 8. Instead of being easier to use, it was confusing. Any program, now called app. required going into several screens instead of the single start menu. There is no area, button, etc. to close these apps. The BIGGEST problem I had was at week five, The computer died. I was able to get into the bios and got several error messages. Called Dell, only to be told the motherboard and the hard drive were dead and would have to be replaced.The computer I had before the Dell, an HP, it's motherboard died after 6 months. I had to send it to HP to get it fixed. Who ever fixed it hacked my computer and I spent almost a year getting that straightened out. Two years after it was \"fixed\" it went completely haywire and died for good. My warranty had run out. It would cost less to buy a new computer than get it fixed yet again. Basically the $1200 I paid for it was a total waste. What happened to QUALITY products? Where is the pride in making a solid, well working computer?I teach how to use computers, how to upgrade computers, and I have worked as a computer tech to help others with computer problems and questions. Until three years ago I have never seen such sloppy, untrained \"professions\" who build computers and create software. In my opinion to other computer buyers, don't spend more than $500 for any computer because chances are good there will be major problems with it.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "My personal Laptop", "Author": "Betty Shaw", "ReviewID": "RPL1NVA2M4312", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This has run without a glitch from the start.

I never felt it was user friendly from the start (Windows 8/non-touch screen) but thought I would learn in time.  That didn't happen and the early demise is a real disappointment.  I am a light user and really feel this final issue was not my doing.  The Dell support I contacted today was a horrendous 1 1/2 hour phone call with many transfers and the repitition of most information.  Microsoft support was a similar experience.  I will have this computer repaired  locally, not going to send it in and save my $ for a product not produced by either Dell or Microsoft.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Disappointed", "Author": "Dulce", "ReviewID": "RNO6BZ57YZ0JV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It came early, so i was surprised....but the PC never turned on.

So far, this one has been great.  The processor is plenty fast for everyday computing, web browsing, watching videos, etc.  The keyboard is big and easy to type on, and the screen is very clear.  I don't know how it would be for gaming and things like that, but considering the processor speed, memory size, etc., it was the best deal I found.The main drawback was that it came with Windows 8, which does not come with a \"Start\" button and instead has a separate start page with \"apps\".  But I downloaded (actually purchased for $3) a program that installs a start button that looks and acts pretty much exactly like the old one, and bypasses the start menu when I start the computer.  So now it basically functions like previous Windows versions, which is great.  So overall I am very happy with the computer so far.", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "rotten deal", "Author": "Deborah M.

I called Dell (in India) and was ABSOLUTLEY NOT SATISFIED with the techies. They were trying to sell me the $259/yr software contract before even determining if it was software or not.
