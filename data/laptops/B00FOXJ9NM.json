{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Laptop", "Author": "snakes3992", "ReviewID": "R2OZUAUX31X3E5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is really nice, the AMD A-10 processor is really good, it's really fast. I like the fact it has 8gbs of ram, which gives you enough space to run video, and run games. For gaming, it's decent, because it has an AMD A-10 processor with Radeon HD graphics 8610 G which is just as good as a 1gb graphics card. Skyrim plays very well on this laptop, but not in Ultra Quality or High, it's only good when play it in Low or Medium Quality. You can still mod it, but it only can run up to 15 mods, depends if they're using too much ram, or graphics. Windows 8 is not a bad as I expected to be, so far, it's pretty good, it does have some flaws. You might like Windows 8, if you want to try it out, or stick with Windows 7 or Mac Os X. Virus protection is decent, I recommend Tech Micro Titanium, it's excellent for virus protection, it will protect you from malware, trojan, and any other viruses that comes in contact with your computer. The good thing is that you can upgrade the ram up to 16gb, I'm not quite sure you can put a very high graphics card in this laptop, you can look up online about that or ask a person from Best Buy or Staples. I don't like the fact that the battery life is low, it's only 4hrs 20mins. It doesn't get too hot, which is good, but the keyboard is too flat, I prefer a Razer keyboard, those are great keyboards. Over all this laptop is really nice, it's slick, it's doesn't get hot that much, great ram space, great hard drive space, great processor, good operating system, decent virus protection, sound quality is good, decent for gaming, great to watch videos and movies on, it only can play DVDs, goodscreen size, good thing it has hdmi, which I can connected to my Plasma Screen TV. This laptop is good, but for gaming, buy a Lenovo, Asus, Alienware, Macbook Pro, Msi, iBuyPower, or a Sony, those brands are great for gaming, but a toshiba is decent for gaming.", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good laptop, but very poor shipping packing", "Author": "James R.

The hard drive is subject to shock. Anybody that has dealt with computers should know this. When they go thru UPS or FedEx, they get a lot of hard handling. I am very disappointed in this shipment, as the computer had been shipped before by UPS as the shipping tag was still on the box with the number. Then it was shipped with FedEx to me. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO WAKE UP.

Not a fan of windows 8 but not much we can do to stop that , seems like all laptops are going that way so I should go ahead and learn it. I have owned other Toshiba laptops and like them. It seems to have everything you need for the avg user. Not a gaming laptop but you should already know that if your a gamer.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop but Windows 8 is bad.", "Author": "rabern michael trammell", "ReviewID": "R3RHBV1XKALC2K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I would give the Laptop a 4 if it didn't have Windows 8 on it. My main problems are the OS, built-in battery, and lack of driver updates from Toshiba. I would still recommend the laptop. Its plenty fast enough for everyday use, looks nice, and is decent for gaming.Pros- The laptop is fast enough to do every thing I do and boots fast.- Plays games well for an integrated GPU. Runs Skyrim and Diablo 3 on Medium to High.- The brushed aluminum case is nice and gives it a more sturdy feel.- The Wifi range is a little better than the other Laptops I have owned.Cons- Comes with Windows 8 and it sucks.- Laptop only supports 1333 Mhz Ram even though it comes with 1600 Mhz.- Laptop comes with only 768 MB of Dedicated RAM and you can't change the set amount in the BIOS.- Toshiba is very slow about releasing new Drivers for the Graphics card.- Battery is not removable. So if the battery dies you have to have it fixed by Toshiba.Note: I would not update to Windows 8.1 on this laptop. I did right after I had bought it and the laptop began freezing up constantly and I had to restore it to get the Windows 8.1 update off. It was fine before the update and has been ever since I restored it.", "Date": "February 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "maria zarikou", "ReviewID": "R28ERVRULEWOB0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i like it because it is very lightweight and really beautiful with lots of potential and power, really good choice", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "2 fast 4 school", "Author": "Manuel Lopez", "ReviewID": "R3EEBKYEWWOH4P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When it comes to school, this lap has all that's needed.

Almost right out of the box the keyboard and touchpad/mouse would just quit working. I've looked at other Toshibas and this appears to be a problem in some of Toshiba's other laptops as well rather than just being my laptop unit. Updating to Windows 8.1 is also not that easy. Toshiba has a note on the seal that they basically have the right to monitor everything you do if you use the laptop. I also did not like that the consumer is not allowed to remove the battery. If you have battery problems you have to take it to a shop to have it removed (and a Staples manager informed me that Toshiba has a lot of battery problems).  I was happy that Staples let me exchange it with a new unit. However, I would have gotten a completely different brand had I realized that the touchpad/keyboard problem was a common one. However, since I got it as a Black Friday deal I will not be able to get another brand with as good of specs for what I paid. Since I have not yet received the new Toshiba Satellite, I cannot speak about it, but if I have the same problem I will be returning it and will never buy a Toshiba product again. I work for the IT department of my college and I've done my research--So, I know what I'm talking about.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "No back-lit keyboard but faster memory speed.", "Author": "Ben Richardson", "ReviewID": "R1WKXXM3HN4YFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I'm happy with the performance and design of the PC itself, at first I wanted the backlit keyboard but the large symbols are easily seen with little light and the faster memory makes up for it. Windows 8 is a new experience but works fairly well once the initial shock subsides as my Windows Phone has the tiles interface. The disc drive can open easily when grazing the side so be careful and the power plug and ethernet port and a usb are all on the left, which my wife's HP is on the right and it has a cheap plastic casing so it feels a lot more sturdy and much less turdy than it. Compared to the old version of the Satellites, it is sleek, lightweight and well built though the screen washes out a little bit, but better too light than too dark I guess.
