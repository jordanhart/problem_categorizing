{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT budget laptop!!", "Author": "WiseCrew", "ReviewID": "R1RYE9KPDKPO4E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this laptop for a student & we LOVE it!!  It is perfect for what we need it for.  We got it for $299 at WalMart.com & the extended warranty too for $29.I was a bit nervous about it because another reviewer complained about the volume, but we find the volume to be fine.  It isn't going to shatter any windows, but it is perfectly fine for listening to music while computing, etc.  I wouldn't turn up the volume to listen to music across a room, but like I said, it is great for listening to music, while surfing the net, etc.  I will say I HATE WINDOWS 8 100%, but that is not a computer performance issue... that is an OS issue.If you want to listen to loud music get some decent plug in speakers & there you go.  For $300 you certainly can't expect so much.  It is a basic laptop that serves it purpose well for those seeking champagne on a beer budget.This is a great laptop for those on a tight budget... it has a good amount of RAM & a decent hard drive for the money... PLUS the hard drive can be expanded to increase capacity AND the RAM can be beefed up, which is a big plus in my book because we can update it before we need to replace it.So far it is a WIN, WIN!!  I will update down the road after we've had it for a while.-------------------------------------------UPDATE: 4-29-14This laptop has still been a great buy & we like it.  Yes, it is a cheap laptop, but it more than serves its purpose.  I was able to hook it via wifi to our printer which makes it even nicer not to have to use wires for that :).I love the airplane mode to keep it from constantly sending out signals for wifi, which we always use unless we need to use internet to reduce our exposure to EMFs, which also helps to reduce battery drainage.Great deal & investment overall!", "Date": "September 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for basic use.", "Author": "dubindvm \"sugartaffy\"", "ReviewID": "RSTBKJ3EFXQBT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop for a family member who wanted a computer for word processing, web surfing, and very light online gaming (no heavy graphics).  So far, this has been perfect for her.  The speed is more than adequate for everything she needs done, and setup was easy.  Like the other Toshiba notebook models I've tried, the keyboard feel wasn't to my personal preference, but she has no complaints.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Audio problem", "Author": "Scott Hylton", "ReviewID": "R1C0ILAGQ9XALU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop itself is really good. The graphics are awesome, the pre-installed apps and software is helpful, and the processor is good for an average user. The only real problem is the audio: it tends to be really low and fuzzy. If you don't plan to use this primarily for audio, I recommend it. If all you want is music, consider a different one.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pure Junk", "Author": "Disenchanted", "ReviewID": "R2PYQK3DOK1MT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Toshiba low-end laptops are pure garbage. Flimsy, cheap, unreliable, and built with the cheapest components available. Save your money and spend a bit more on something else not built by Toshiba. Best case scenario, you might get 6-12 months out of your laptop before things start to fail. Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba. Consider any laptops made by Toshiba as being purely disposable, or built for third word countries with no consumer protection laws.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Light and reliable", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RWEFLHOX7VJNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm typing on it now. Perfect for my uses-- photo, still graphics, word processing and social media. Speaker is a little tinny, but I'm not planning on listening to more than a YouTube video on it.

I purchased this for school purposes. It does the job.  I love how quiet and cool it stays no matter how long it's on.  The material it's made of feels cheap to the touch. I have been using this laptop for a few weeks now without any issues, until the last two days. I have not added anything to the computer to cause it to be slow although the last two times i've tried starting it up it doesn't want to respond. The scroll feature on the mouse pad will randomly stop working as well as the key pad. Not a big fan of the windows 8 either.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent, basic laptop", "Author": "Jon D.

It has the fastest warm-up time of any computer I have ever experienced.  From pushing the power button, it was displaying the Start menu in 9 seconds.  At 1 minute, 3 seconds, I was on amazon.com, ready to write this review.
