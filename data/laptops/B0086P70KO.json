I thought this would be a good little intro computer and though it works I was disappointed with it on the overall. Web pages are slow, there was no iphoto or imovie, very bare bones. The lack of a card reader and not picking up my iphone were also disappointing.I haven't given up on apple but really prefer the windows at least in comparison to this computer.", "Date": "November 20, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0086P70KO"}}
