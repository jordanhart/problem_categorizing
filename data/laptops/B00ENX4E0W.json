Windows 8 takes up over 50% of ram out of the box without anything else installed or running. I upgraded the memory to 16 gig, and that has helped a little, but the CPU is still too slow to handle a browser with 3 tabs open on pages that don't even have Flash. Movies stutter, pages load slow, page scrolling and typing buffers all the time. Sometimes I would think that it was maybe my internet connection, but my 5 year old Dell laptop, that despite having a slightly slow clock speed and was run over by a truck, still works better. I don't know how anyone can use this for even the most basic computational needs. Toshiba should offer a refund to anyone who has ever bought one of these.", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do Not Buy", "Author": "robert Todd Stoebener", "ReviewID": "R1IN28GKCJYXM0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If, you want a computer that stalls on the most basic tasks then, this is the computer for you.
