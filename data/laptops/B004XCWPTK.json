If your looking for a gaming or hightech laptop, this is not for you. This laptop would best suit a business proffesional. I've only had it for 2 weeks but its already exceeded my expectations. Im very happy with my purchase. The only con that i could truly say bothers me is that the battery only lasts about 40 minutes off the charger so im gonna have to go and purchase a new battery, but for the price of a 2.4 ghz duo core, 160hd, 4gbs of ram, theres not much complaining here.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "i need a restore disk", "Author": "vicky Motley", "ReviewID": "RNXH00CDZX09", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did not get a warranty with the computer or a restore disk if i have any problems restoring a program.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works good for me", "Author": "robert sanders", "ReviewID": "R1IIZAZV3CD1L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Is great for what I use it for.

Had USB port damage (can't connect via one USB port in back). Also seller indicated item had \"light\" use but once computer was received it looked like it was used heavily on daily basis.  Seller was apologetic and has offered to provide full refund and pay for return shipping. I ended up keeping the computer. It was purchased for someone who is doing very basic online search and doesn't use much memory (and didn't want to use a tablet).", "Date": "January 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop & great price", "Author": "Thomas M.
