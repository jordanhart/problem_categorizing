{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One-Of-A-Kind, But Beware Of Differences", "Author": "Joshua", "ReviewID": "R2RJSRI8SJSE0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's what's rotten--there are about a zillion different \"y510p\" models of the IdeaPad. So comparison shopping is extraordinarily difficult. This is compounded by the fact that, despite what some commenters are saying, this exact model number is *not* available on the Lenovo site. Even more hilarious is that contacting Lenovo support to ask details on the differences is a moot point--they'll tell you that, despite it being their product, if it's not listed on their website, they can't tell you about it.So for more details on this exact model number (59406648), check out the listing on Tiger Direct. As I said, there are many, many different IdeaPad models, but that Tiger Direct listing has some more specifics (for example, on the processor).Another thing to be wary of is all of the confusing information that exists about the Ultrabay. In terms of the Ultrabay, this exact model from Amazon comes with the second graphics card. So yes, it's a dual-graphics card setup straight out of the box--you do not need to upgrade this. I have to add that this might still be confusing when you first fire up this machine, because they give you all of the DVD software, including the burning suites.But again--this does NOT come with a DVD or BluRay drive. You do get tons of bloatware though! A quick internet search will help you delete the garbage you don't need.Performance-wise, this is amazing. It runs a little hot, but modern games on high settings play well, and don't seem to chug. The speakers (the JBL ones everyone's so hyped about) are nice and loud, but they tend to favor the mid-range.That's the bulk of it. Everything else is pretty clear-cut, but I wanted to help anyone else who was a little confused about the lack of and/or conflicting information out there. Especially when it comes to other models--you *cannot* get this model many places, including Lenovo's own site, and it really is remarkable for the money!

Moreover, it has the 4th generation i7-4700MQ CPU and 16 gigabytes of ram.

It was a sad day when my old laptop sailed down the river Styx due to overheating issues. It was a great laptop, and this Lenovo has a lot to live up to. I was never a Lenovo fan. I had worked on them for years as well as many other brands of laptops/desktops, but Lenovo never really wowed me. They have always had a solid line of business laptops that seem to be quality and I would never discourage someone from buying a Lenovo (can't say the same for Acer, Dell, and HP's), but they were never on my short list either. Well I can happily say that has changed. Lenovo has stepped up their game in recent years and this Laptop is hardly the exception to their new improved lineup.Price:Very good. For the specs and performance this laptop offers, it is a great deal. Most Laptops with SLI are well north of the $2000 mark. This seems like a steal in comparison. It has quality components all around. Are the components on the cutting edge of performance? No. However for a laptop just over $1000 new, you will have an extremely hard time finding better. I know, I tried.Size:I was surprised to find this laptop to be almost identical in size to my old 17\" laptop. The screen is only 15.6\", but the bezel around the screen is quite wide. I think they could have easily fit a 17\" screen in the same space. This makes it look like Lenovo got a little cheap and put a smaller screen in and then encased it in about an inch of plastic all the way around. I realize I bought a 15.6\" laptop and not a 17\", however I thought that would also get me a smaller form factor laptop as well. This has the body of a 17\" laptop with a 15.6\" screen. When it is closed it is not really thick, but by no means would I call it thin.Feel:I like the feel of this laptop. It feels very sturdy. The Aluminum is very nice, if a fingerprint magnet. I trust the laptop to be able to withstand some punishment and still keep ticking. The keyboard is great, I love the individually back lit keys and feel of the keyboard. The keyboard feels very high class and quality. Everything all around feels like it is quality made. I have handled many laptops through out my career and this feels and looks top shelf in comparison.Components/performance:This laptop performs incredibly well, both in games and in day to day life. The Intel Core i7-4700MQ is quite powerful. I rarely ever tax the CPU even when running video encoding and other CPU intensive tasks. The 16 GB of RAM is more than enough for every task. I have run multiple games at the same time (Eve Online, Marvel Hero's, Neverwinter, and LoL) and I have never once ran out of available memory. The Video Cards are awesome. One GeForce 755m would be enough to run games at max settings, add in the second and it just dominates. The only weakness of this system is the Hard drive. The 5400RPM 1TB drive drags the whole system down. I'm surprised Lenovo even put this hard drive in the system, regardless of the 8GB \"cache\". 5400RPM drives are never seen anywhere near gaming hardware unless it is a secondary or tertiary storage drive. It feels like a slap in the face and like Lenovo definitely went cheap on the hard drive. There is no excuse for it. Luckily the laptop comes with a M.2 NGFF SSD slot. I got a MyDigitalSSD SC2 Super Cache 2 42mm SATA III 6G M.2 NGFF SSD Solid State Drive (128GB). I installed my OS on it, and now the laptop is as fast as it should have been from the factory.Software:As soon as I got this laptops and my M.2 NGFF SSD Solid State Drive (128GB), I format reloaded it. I hate bloatware. I refuse to bow to any company's pre-packaged software. Now that being said, reloading a Windows 8 laptop Computer is far harder than is should be. The OS Product key is in the BIOS, not on a sticker or anywhere else. You need to download a tool to read it from the BIOS and write it down somewhere in order to have a physical copy. Then MS has decided that they no longer want to offer the fast easy download of a ISO so I can burn it to a disk or create a bootable thumb drive. OH NO, I have to use some Windows 8 Upgrade Adviser, and then my product key is not a Retail Key, but an OEM, so I can't even do that. I had to use a Generic Windows 8 Key from a google search and then download the bootable USB drive image and then after the OS install change the product key. So many hoops to jump through. So Much BS. I ended up installing Windows 7 Ultimate and skipped the head ache. Best decision I ever made.In conclusion, this is a good to great laptop. It has flaws, but it really shines in places as well. There is a reason Amazon keeps selling out of them. If they are don't buy from a third party retailer, wait for Amazon to get it back in stock and save yourself $200-$300. For someone like me who is comfortable cracking it open and upgrading to an SSD in the M.2 NGFF slot, I can not recommend it enough. Even if you just want to use the M.2 NGFF slot for another or larger cache drive, it WILL boost your performance 3-4 fold. I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend this Laptop to others, IF they are willing to overlook the flaws.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop for the price, but know that you WILL have to put some effort into making it better.", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R2LEX8A7IT9YXJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This applies to this (59406648) model.First off, I previously owned a Lenovo Yoga 13 that I had sold to acquire this one. It was the top of the line model with 256GB SSD etc, and it was blazing fast. It had some bloatware and tweaking that needed done, but not too much.This thing is LOADED with bloatware. I've currently spent 30+ minutes removing most of the stuff that they've installed.With that being said, I'll move on.The first thing I did when I received this (before I even turned it on for the first time) was opened up the bottom to check and see if it had the connector for the m.2 SATA port...and it did! I was thrilled about that. I will definitely invest in one.The first time I booted it up, it seemed to take forever to do the initial setup. Granted, I've been so used to pure SSDs that I may just be spoiled, but I hear the more you use it, the more it will cache on that 8GB in the 1TB drive, which will make it faster to boot.It has a nice backlit keyboard, and a wonderful bright matte display. The sound quality is amazing coming from a laptop (at least in my opinion). I work on computers for a living, so I see all kinds of laptops come and go.The trackpad isn't what I prefer, but some people like it. It reminds me of the one that is on the Yoga which took me some time to come around to, but I just miss having physical buttons. The one on the Yoga was much smoother to the touch, while this one has more of a rough surface. This one can also mess up from time to time, and is probably one of the worst I've ever used when it comes to response.The fans on this thing are super quiet compared to what I had expected. The temps seem relatively okay. Using Intel Burn Test I maxed out the CPU around 90C before the fan kicked in and almost instantly dropped it to 80C again. Seems to hang around 80-82C while maxed out. after a few minutes it drops the clock speed.It kind of freaked me out because I was trying to run furmark to test the GPU temps, but only 1 card was working. Got Metro LL benchmark up and running and it turns out Furmark was the one with the problems. No worries. Ranged from 70C to 80C max load.Fingerprints are also a huge issue if that sort of thing bothers you.From what I can see in one day, it's a great laptop to grab. -1 star for all the bloatware and trackpad though.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Immediate problems with this laptop within 30 minutes of turning it on for the first time", "Author": "Scott Weisbecker", "ReviewID": "R3TDD2NLKJ5CYT", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Within 10 minutes of turning this laptop on the fan on the right side started making a high pitched, grinding noise. I was hoping it would \"break itself in\" or whatever but no. I checked the Lenovo forums and found out i wasn't the only person to have had this problem. So of course, it needs to be shipped back for repairs. This all happened last night when I finally got it so I'll have to wait til Monday to ship it. That wasnt the only problem. While trying to determine what was causing the fan issue, (which seemed to be heat related) there was a software issue where after logging in to the computer itself the screen would just go black. Again i checked the lenovo forums and I wasnt the only one that has had this problem. so I called Lenovo tech support. the guy i talked to was helpful and it was a simple fix (not sure if the fix was permanent though) but for $1300 bucks after shipping I dont think i'm out of line when I expected a properly working computer. As far as performance I didnt quite get that far so I gave it 2 stars for the sake of fairness? My advice to you if you're looking for a decent laptop for gaming or anything else for that matter would be to not just base your decision off the reviews here on amazon. Take a few minutes to browse the technical/support forums on the brand/company's website itself. Had I seen those issues before I bought this thing I probably would have gone with something else.

The only gripes that I have with it are the weird touchpad that doesn't want to act right, but I use a mouse anyway.  And, although the finish looks great, it attracts smudges and smears like crazy.  But those are some pretty minor gripes.  I don't have any issues with the wifi like some stated that they had with previous versions, and I didn't have any issues with the graphics drivers either.

I read a bunch of reviews and ended up deciding on a Lenovo 510P 755 SLI. I decided on this laptop for its price, features, and reviews, all of which have not let me down. This is a phenomenal laptop for the price. The only thing I ended up doing was immediately reformat the HD clean of Windows 8.1 and install Windows 7. This is a personal preference of course but I enjoy Windows 7 style and look and thats why I installed it on this laptop. I've installed a couple of games, Battlefield 4, and some Steam games, it ran these games with ease. Also the laptop I chose has a matte screen, which I like better than a glossy display, especially for gaming. Even though this system will play games at high and ultra settings, Battlefield 4 looks awesome playing at medium and low video settings because the screen is that good. I guess my thought was, \"why spend boat loads of money on something like an Alienware?\" You can literally spend thousands of dollars on these systems and they really aren't any better than something like this Lenovo. For just over a thousand dollars you're getting an incredible laptop that is upgradable, enjoyable to use, low cost, and great quality.

Windows 8.1 is not a deal-breaker as some people point out in other reviews, chances are they only refuse to use the new Start Menu or install 3rd Party software to bring back the original sidebar menu style, anyway. Windows 8 does a better job with using the machine's hardware, so it boosts the FPS on most games. It does not come with that much bloatware as I expected, it ironically has mainly CD Burning software, which is strange for a model computer without a CD drive. Any bloatware can be removed either by hand, or what I did was ue a nifty little program called the PC Decrapifier, which allowed me to make a system restore prior to making any changes and then removed all of the selected programs I did not want without having to select the programs and then \"Uninstall\" and a UAC message in between each program.Like most laptops, its touchpad is a bit off and tends to glitch when you try to tap rather than click, but this is a Gaming Laptop, so chances are you won't be using the touchpad anyway. The \"FN\" keys can easily disable it while typing or using the mouse, which I recommend as the Windows 8.1 gestures could pull you out of the game and back to another, previously opened application with a accidental swipe on the touchpad.The backlit keyboard is a plus, I've always preferred a red glow. Its the perfect amount of color for a computer, unlike those expensive Alienware disco-balls, which this computer can compete against and win due to its extremely low price for what you get. Also, a NUM pad is always helpful on a keyboard. Once again, you can adjust the backlight if it bothers you, either off, low, or high settings.The dual GPUs work great unless you're on battery power, the GPUs automatically drop into a power saving mode to preserve battery life when not plugged in. Its understandable as well, because there is not really a battery out there that can keep two GPUs running for an extended period of time. When on battery power, most games have a drop in FPS so high that it IS unplayable, but chances are you won't be far from a power outlet when playing a game.The Lenovo One-Key recovery option only took twenty minutes to back up, make sure you do this too before installing or uninstalling any programs, it keeps the Operating System \"fresh\" to how it came, that way if anything happens you know there isn't a problem after restoring to these settings.All 16GB of RAM works great, and it DOES boot relatively quickly. Contrary to other online reviews or videos I have seen, the 5400RPM hard drive allows for fairly fast file and program access. I've timed the computer off of a cold boot to load Photoshop CS5 in 7 seconds, which is not bad even comparing to an SSD. Adobe Flash Professional loads about the same.Sound quality is the best I've heard from a laptop. I barely turn it above 40% due to how well it sounds and how loud it is, it certainly beats my old laptop, and can challenge my home stereo to a duel.2x USB 3.0 ports have great transfer speeds, the other 2.0 port duals as an \"always-on\" port that emits power even with the computer off, but needs to be enabled in the BIOS. I use it for my Cooling Pad, that way with the computer off, it still gets airflow to cool down.Here are some game settings for a few games, they all run without any hiccups and never drop to unplayable FPS unless on battery power.Battlefield 4 -Screen Settings = Full Screen 1920 x 1080Ambient Oclusion = HBAOAnti-Aliasing - HighGraphics Quality - HighEffects - HighLighting - HighTerrain Quality - HighTexture Quality - HighTitanfall -Screen Settings = Full Screen 1920 x 1080Texture Filtering - BilinearAll Settings are set to \"High\"Anti-Ailasing - 2x MSAAMinecraft (With Optifine) -Extreme Render DistanceFancy GraphicsMaximum Smooth LightingFancy FogClouds : OnAnimations : OnHD \"Sphax\" Resource PackFull Screen ModeFPS AC Power- Averages around 200FPS On Battery - Averages around 143 (keeping in mind that only 30 FPS is needed to play most games)All in all, this computer is great for the money.

The Y510p is not as sexy thin as the Stealth but has a slimmer profile compared to the beastly Alienware.  It was fun playing BF4 on ultra settings hoovering around 45fps consistently.  BioShock Infinite gameplay was excellent on ultra as well.  As long as the games support SLI, this rig can play the games fairly well at ultra settings.  It is silky smooth at high settings on all games. The keyboard is shockingly good for gaming.  the keys action was smooth and had enough feedback for twitch games.  It ran circles around my old Alienware laptop. The screen has a non-glare coating which helped immensely with reflection. The laptop frame has a lot of metal casing around it, producing a fairly high build quality.  This is reflective when opening the laptop vs the very plastic-y Alienware.  Where the Alienware flexed and creaked, the Y510p does not.I installed Windows 8.1 Update 1 last night and it went without a hitch.  With Update 1, Win8 is a much better experience for non-touchscreen setups like this laptop.  It seems this version of the laptop took care of the issues previous owners had with updating from Win8 to Win8.1. So far I have not experienced any software glitches with drivers or hardware.  There was not a lot of bloatware, mostly Lenovo sponsored apps.There are a couple of things that will keep this from being five stars. The first is the slow drive. Yes you get a 1TB of storage but it is on a really slow drive.  Watching my friend boot under six seconds on his Stealth makes the y510p look terribly slow and it is, when booting up.  Thankfully that will not be too often.  The second is the touchpad.  Gaming is not a problem with a mouse but navigating around in a web browser without a mouse can test your patience. Left clicking moves the pointer enough to click on links other than the one desired. Multi-touch trains you well, not the other way around.  Once you adopt to the quirky touchpad, it becomes less of an issue but it is something that brings down the over all experience.  Though the screen was matte, the bezel around it was not.  It kind of cheapens the screen a bit with a cheesy shinny large bezel.I retired my Alienware M15x as a home theater rig with Blu-ray which works extremely well.  With the y510p, I can still drop in on a couple of LAN parties and game.

I have three year old laptops that support that. The 2.4Ghz band is way too crowded these days and the 5GHz band is a must especially in a \"performance\" laptop that Lenovo advertises. The text on the 1920x1080 screen was rather blurry. When I say blurry, it looked liked every black letter was slightly bleeding on a white background.

I bought the dual graphics model and was hoping that it'd be a quality machine for the amount of money I paid for it. I did my research and even went to the store to check it out multiple times before I made my purchase. It looks well built and runs fast enough for daily use. But underneath that black brushed aluminum-looking shell, it's a piece of garbage. This is my 2nd one since Lenovo had to replace my 1st. Now with the 2nd, I have a bunch of issues with it that are completely different than the 1st. Hmm... no way Lenovo could send me 2 defective pieces of junk. The 1st Y510p I had spent over 72 cumulative hours on the phone with Lenovo tech support and even allowed them to access my machine so they could \"troubleshoot\" it. After realizing each tech support person just did the same exact thing as the last, I got fed up and asked to send it in for repairs. I sent it in twice and it came back with the same issue every time. After the second, I wanted a refund, but was told that I could only get 60% of my purchase amount refunded and I would have to return the machine on my cost. So, I chose the other option to receive a replacement machine and... SURPRISE... another piece of junk. Now I have to waste weeks of my life getting this one fixed and probably will end up just throwing it out the window.LENOVO HAS THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE. THEY WILL NOT MAKE THINGS RIGHT. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND LENOVO.

I'm going to just keep posting this everywhere I can find.Lenovo; For Those Who Don't:January 23rd I received the IdeaPad Y510p from Lenovo, and it ran like a dream for 13 days, then I go to take my dog outside and put my laptop in sleep mode and come back in and it won't turn back on. I called in and had the option to return/refund it or repair it. I went with repair in hopes of being able to keep my data and awaited the box that tech support said I would be receiving in 3-5 days...It's the motherboard that needs replaced; power light turns on but the fans, hard drive, keyboard lights, screen, and even USB power are unresponsive. A $1,649 paperweight.20 days later I call back, having been busy with two jobs in Advertising, furious. I found out that it was never sent out and that it was just kind of forgot about. So you kindly \"escalated\" the repair to an on-site request after you said it would take almost twenty days for a repair and I would still have to wait, that you thought I was sending it in a second time for a second repair, and that you said I couldn't refund it until I told you I talked to a Sales Manager and they said I could and you looked into my history and found I actually did talk to someone and I could due to the situation.Well that on-site guy THAT YOU SENT OUT came today and broke the laptop even more. He lost one screw when taking it apart, forgot to put two screws back in, broke the bottom latch/lock for the laptop, part of the frame (a little plastic clip on the inside but it looks warped now) and was banging the laptop, jabbing it with his plastic tool, and kept saying \"I sure hope I don't broke it, don't wanna do that!\" I took pictures and cringed the whole time. I about had a stroke watching this guy \"try and not break\" my laptop. AND IT'S STILL NOT FIXED. It's just been sitting on my desk since I got it.This is a work laptop.I not only make money on this laptop, I spend money on it monthly for my software.I make $18 an hour at the job I got this for, and it has cut back my time there drastically. I can't work there I can only work from home. I was averaging about 3-5 hours a day until the laptop broke. Now I get less because my home computer isn't meant for this work.The software is $20 a month that I can't use.My freelance pays $30-$60 an hour just for design fees.I've lost more money because of this laptop possibly than for what it's even worth.You better get back to me soon.You have my case number.You have my name, phone number, and email.If Lenovo is for \"Those Who Do\" then what you need to DO is start making up for what you DON'T DO.So do something right for once and call me.This laptop has not only cost me time and money, but now it's cost me my patience.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,239.95", "Features": "Intel Core i7-4700MQ 2.4 GHz Processor\n16 GB DDR3 RAM\n1 TB 5400 rpm Hard Drive; 8 GB Solid-State Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 8.1; 3-Hour Battery Life", "Name": "Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p 15.6-Inch Laptop (59406648) Dusk Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51EtZMUrpSL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HIY8TNQ"}}
