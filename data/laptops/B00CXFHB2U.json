Windows 8 is honestly not even as bad as people make it seem. it took me about 20 minutes to figure out everything. the only bad thing is the 5400rpm hdd, which isnt a super big deal. the laptop boots pretty quick and the battery life isn't terrible, but what do you expect out of a 17.3-inch screen with 1600x900 pixels and a beast processor. the sound on this laptop is pretty good the beats audio is alright, you can definitely hear the base. there is bluetooth on this model. its build quality is pretty nice it doesn't feel super cheap but its nowhere near Apple quality. it doesn't seem to run too hot it stays around 40-50 degrees when running most applications which is decent. browsing the web it gets around mid 30s to low 40s. I bought a 2 year warranty from Square Trade and its way better than paying for an HP warranty, so for people complaining its pointless never buy a warranty from the company that makes the product as they will take their sweet time. Overall this is a pretty good laptop that will handle just about any application you throw at it. I wouldn't recommend it for gaming as the GPU is pretty weak, so if you're a gamer on a budget I'd recommend the Lenovo y410p which has been on sale for quite some time and the specs are more gamer oriented, but it will take them forever to ship it.", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nightmare upgrading to Windows 8.1", "Author": "IndyRon", "ReviewID": "R3RU9MLP6WCQ2Z", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Two error messages appeared on logon after upgrading to Windows 8.1. I spent 3 hours with Microsoft tech support and another 2 hours with HP tech support trying to get rid of them. Imagine trying to understand people with heavy Indian accents on a phone line over which you can barely hear them, let alone understand them. When they took control over the computer it was a relief.We had used a Logitech mouse before upgrading and one error was related to the loading of an unfound, unneeded Logitech driver. The other error involved the driver for the accelerometer that parks the heads on the hard drive before a dropped notebook hits the floor. Microsoft tech support eventually disabled both.Wanting to keep the protection of the accelerometer, I contact HP. (AccelerometerSt.exe is HP software.) The HP tech spent two hours trying to upgrade the HP 3D DriveGuard Software with a version not meant for this model. He also suggested it was a Microsoft problem and that I get back in contact with Microsoft.Then I logged a tech support case for the issue. This morning they closed the case with the message: \"Support Case Manager is not available at this time for HP ENVY 17-j020us Quad Edition Notebook PC\" and suggested I go to [...]At customercare I initiated a chat session with a tech support who shortly admitted that a Windows 8.1 version of HP 3D DriveGuard was not yet available for this model and that I should check back in a month. It may not be the answer I wanted, but it was a straight answer that didn't waste my time.I'd recommend that buyers not upgrade to 8.1 for at least a month.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop Computer", "Author": "Upstate Guy", "ReviewID": "R2BJRCXZMZCLNM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a really powerful computer.  It's fast, has a  lot of ram, a lot of hard drive.  Keypad seems awfully sensitive.  While I'm doing wordprocessing the cursor has a tendency to bounce, from line to line, paragraph to paragraph, page to page.  Hate Windows 8.  Wish Microsoft had evolved Windows 7, rather than have done such a complete redo.

Setup was easy. It boots up fast, but login is disappointingly slow. It came with Windows 8 and the upgrade to 8.1 is now available for free. We haven't done the upgrade yet, but plan to do so. We understand there is an option in 8.1 to boot to the desktop and a start menu, which will resolve most of the issues we have with Windows 8.Like another reviewer remarked, the edge of the notebook is tapered and isn't as thick as a network (RJ-45) jack. I don't find it an issue when plugging a network cable in, but it can be darn near impossible to get it out. Good thing the WiFi works great.HP's touchpad is very \"touchy\", plus the buttons are integrated into the pad. We are using a mouse with it.The size of the screen is great - until you take it on the road. It's nearly impossible to use on a plane. It's heavy, although not nearly as heavy as another HP 17.3\" we have that has the bigger, longer-life battery. We call that one the \"aircraft carrier\".", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R2CZ4YALNS5RRO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast but great battery life for day-to-day tasks.

Certain programs wouldn't run with others, HP Customer Service was totally useless, and the machine is slower than the 4 year old HP I replaced.  Amazon was partially helpful, but never followed up on their e mail promising to follow up.  The only helpful person in this chain was the company that actually shipped the computer.  A person answered the phone on the first ring and actually talked me through several of the problems.  Kudos to them.Under no circumstances would I recommend this product to anyone, nor after experiencing HP Customer Service, will I probably purchase another HP product.Bad product, bad service!

After resetting the BIOS for Legacy support I installed Windows 7 Ultimate after which NOTHING with respect to I/O works. Not the USB, Ethernet, or DVD drive so there is no way to get the Windows 7 drivers installed. The case edge design is purely for ascetic purposes to make the customer think the laptop is thinner than it actually is. This means that plugging in the Ethernet cable requires two hands. The edge is thinner than an RJ45 jack so HP designed in a flap door that you open with one hand, and using the other hand insert the cable. The DVD drive also suffers from this edge design. The tray closes clumsily and feels like it may break at any time. If I can't find a way to get Windows 7 installed, this is going back for a refund. The Apple Mac laptop supports Windows 7 so I guess I'll be buying a MAC instead. Windows 8 is unusable. Whomever at MS came up with this design should be fired.
