And finally I decided to buy this machine for work and RAW photography processing, since Mac has a great user-friendly and stability reputation. I don't want to worry about computer problems a lot anymore.My expectations were:I - User friendly laptop so I don't worry fixing computer issues instead to be productive. That's why I choose a Mac product.II - Relative fast computer for scientific data processing, image analysis and RAW photography processing. Also for watching movies sometimes. That's why I choose a retina Macbook ProIII - Great portability for travel. This is: relatively small, thin, light and high battery duration. That's why I choose a 13-inch instead 15-inch.So what I found in this computer was:(+):1. Screen, of course... this is a spectacular screen: great for image processing, so that is one point to favor.2. Fast CPU: I use Matlab and Wolfram Mathematica a lot for data processing and image analysis and this computer does the job quite good and fast.3. portability: very thin for the power and also it feels very light. Excellent battery duration (when I was in the train I turned WIFI OFF and I had 10 hour battery duration. With wifi ON could be 7 hours... now I have 12% of max capacity and it says 50min remaining)(-):main disappointments:1. (Hardware Performance) Wifi - Bluethooth problems at first day of use: slow wifi when bluethooth is ON2. (Instabilities and errors) Alias (Mac shortcuts) serious problems caused 50% Mac storage use: I cannot delete the alias after I copy 60Gb of videos and photography to a backup, I'm been reading a lot of forums threads and my problems hasn't been solved yet...3. (Instabilities and errors) It cannot play 60p videos at 60fps, despite it says is a 60hz display: I'm using a Sony HDR-CX260V High Definition Handycam 8.9 MP Camcorder with 30x Optical Zoom and 16 GB Embedded Memory (Black) (2012 Model) and is a pity that I cannot watch my Full HD \"high speed\" videos (60p) at their original speed in the rMBP.4. edit: (Instabilities and errors) Professional software crashes: I'm using ImageJ and Mathematica (lastest versions for Mac) and I'm experimenting a lot of crashes (OS is fully upgraded). I've been using these softwares and same codes in Windows and I didn't have those crashes... those problems make me lose a lot of time in data analysis...another disappointments:3. (Design) Keyboard may be printed in the screen4. (Hardware Performance) solid state drive is not fast as I expected to be (reboot, copy files, running programs)5. (Hardware Performance) The video card is awful for playing in retina full size, although I knew that and I accepted it... it still been a disappointment. How can this amazing screen has this video card? (I know that I said it was for work but is a temptation to play, for example, Diablo III or Starcraft II or Civilization V)6. Comparing with the Lenovo Z580 (see EDIT)the website loads are a lot slower (using the same WIFI always), also the overall loads and photography processing is slower in the rMBP, since again there are too much pixels to manage...Conclusions: I bought this laptop less than one month ago and I have been dealing with very annoying issues. I'm in a short-term internship in the US so I want to be productive instead dedicating my time to be fixing new Mac laptop issues, for example I have to move about 40Gb of data from an external HDD to the rMBP but I have corrupted files which are using about 60Gb of the 120Gb and I cannot delete them (even with secure delete or terminal or Disk utilities...) . I'm seriously thinking to return this product (I have 2 more weeks for that) and to buy maybe an Asus Zenbook or something similar. I'm quite disappointed.EDIT (talking about the RETURN and what laptop I chose after the rMBP):  I finally returned this laptop for a full refund (thanks amazon), since I had to much annoying wifi, SSD and OSX issues; also the lack of decent performance for an overpriced (US$1614.00) laptop, I believed in apple reputation for the price, but it vanished quickly. Instead of that I bought a Lenovo z580 (Win8, i5 3210M, 8Gb Ram, Intel HD4000 Graphics, 15.6',750Gb Hdd) for $540.00 and it runs great, it doesn't print the keyboard in the screen, the overall performance is much better for me, no crushes, no issues, no inestabilities, a lot faster photography processing, and the WIFI feels faster as well, I almost hear the fan and everything is cool even with high loads of data... Also it has VGA port (that I use a lot for meetings and presentations, 4 USB ports (2x3.0,2x2.0)... I always use 2 (1 for mouse and 1 for external USB 3.0 HDD) and is nice to have some more to connect the camera or colleagues flash drives. Is nice to have ethernet port as well... the max battery life is around 6-7 hours so that's great for the price.  Should I add $1100 for a 120gb SSD (~$100), smaller but retina display? backlit keyboard? lighter? better multitouch trackpad? but less wifi performance, less usb ports, no VGA, no ethernet... Nah... $1100 is too much difference for the same internal performance laptop and some sacrifices! If you want it for more portability, to edit or just watch photography one by one, to brag with friends or just have a astonishing screen for studing, and obviously, if you can afford it... I think this is for you, and now the price is lower. I feel much better now and I saved ~$1100", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "I have issues with this product", "Author": "blah", "ReviewID": "R242HLASR8UQAZ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got this laptop in september for work and like it, the construction overall is sturdy and the keyboard feels great to type on. The main problem I have is that pixels keep going bad. It is not a huge deal because they only show up when viewing black/dark images but for the price it is a concern. So far four have gone bad and if any more go I will be seeking a fix/replacement from apple. Also worth noting that you are paying for slimness here not performance. I have three computers: cutting edge windows 8.1 GTX 780 and I5-357, Older linux desktop and this one which actually cost the most out of the three.

One of my favorite models was my old Titanium G4 that got me through a good seven years or so of computing. I have seen Macbooks evolve over the past few years and I am pleased with Apple's new offerings. The new Retina display may seem gimmicky, but once you get a hold of one, and have Retina-compatible updates installed to your software base, it is clear that this is not a gimmick and destined to be the future of modern computing.Display aside, the combination of the i5 processor and the larger batter give this model a fantastic battery life. Out of the box, my late 2008 MBP (Core2) got maybe 1.5 hours. This new model can go hours between charges. The Late 2008 model is always running hot (upwards of 95-105 celcius when doing actual work) whereas this model barely breaks a sweat at 40C.The few design decisions I don't like (and would have resulted in a 4.5 rating if possible) are as follows:1) 2 Thunderbolt ports. Frankly, I don't see myself ever owning a thunderbolt product and the support out there is terrible.2) 2 USB ports.

But if you are migrating over to Apple to take advantage of the apparent bargains to be found in the professional software arena (Music Production, Video Production, Graphic Arts, etc.) I am issuing a warning that Apple is lying to you.  Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.  If you are buying Apple to take advantage of these apparent deals...save your money and stick with a PC.
