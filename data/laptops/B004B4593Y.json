Only a year, later it is in the repair shop for the second time. If I want to get it working properly again, I will have paid about as much as I paid for the whole machine. First it was the keyboard, just mysteriously stopped working. Now it's the motherboard, with a loud, BEEP, intermittantly - which is a total distraction. Don't waste your money on this garbage.", "Date": "June 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent purchase and seller!", "Author": "Francisco J.

Its not a bad looking laptop, Surprisingly for the price, this Compaq laptop looks better than the other ones in market today! Except Macs, obviously. This machine is sleek, somewhat thin and pretty much looks like the Black Macbook, which is why I bought this particular laptop! You can always update the ram and hard drive, which matter most in a computer! I don't know if they are all the same but the brightness is this laptop is not as bright as other laptops, which is a downer for me. Overall, great laptop! I suggest you \"youtube it\" for a better look if your skeptical about the looks.", "Date": "December 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "So far - so good", "Author": "wardomnibus", "ReviewID": "R1NF0PPMBDR6RA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this computer because my two Dell desktops (God bless there departed souls) frankly just wore out after 5-7 years of admirable and dependable service and my wallet had more moths than dollars in current residence. I knew from the get-go that this was an inexpensive, barebones computer with relatively limited memory and capacity, but  knowing that most of what I hold dear was in \"The Clouds\" or on Ext. Drives, my computer needs were essentially just basic internet and mail capabilities plus stone-age video/pix and \"office related\" functions. To that extent this  has not disappointed - it has performed flawlessly in the last six months. Of course, I use an external monitor, keyboard/mouse, and .  I do not tax the machine's inherent (albeit limited)capabilities and in return, this humble laptop has made me a happy camper in the 11 months since my purchase. Just keep in mind that the old axiom, \"you get what you pay for\", absolutely applies here. For a mere pittance of $300.00 (new, on sale)this, this little workhorse has served me admirably.Add'l Positives: There is no Windows Vista!!!Negatives:  The overall brightness, contrast and resolution of the screen is disappointing (That's why I'm using an external monitor).", "Date": "July 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "No Cam, dislike it.", "Author": "Tina", "ReviewID": "RIC95PAIWA1M1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Okay so I ordered this product Dec 2010 as a gift to myself because i worked so hard to get it, being a teenager and all..I was disappointed when i realized there wasn't even a webcam with it & the advertisement stated tht there was a cam, i was refund the $20 to get a webcam, really tht was no help to me, who wants a big bulky webcam on top of a laptop? when you were expecting it to be already installed.
