Nice Chiclet keyboard, decent (5 hours) battery life, backlit keyboard, Windows 8 (which I like) but the speaker isn't great. For Beats audio to be attached to the speaker quality you would never know it if it were not for the logo stamped on the speaker. It does get kinda hot underneath even with the HP CoolSense turned on but not nearly as hot as my old computer. The touchscreen is more useful than I thought it would be with Windows 8 [I think Windows 8 was meant for touchscreen computers). The touchscreen isn't really meant to be used all the time (although it can be), just occasionally when you want to access something immediately. It does feel heavy, actually it feels heavier than 5 pounds if you ask me, but it isn't. It does make up for its flaws in speed though. Everything takes like a couple seconds to load. Touchpad is a little stiff, speaker quality doesn't meet expectations, it gets quite warm underneath, and there is a button or two that always remains lit if the computer is on but other than that for under $600 you can't beat it.", "Date": "August 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer at a great price", "Author": "Anthony Del Monaco", "ReviewID": "R9WXFHIZQTYUK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm currently a college student and this computer is perfect for school.

It sports features such as a touchscreen and backlit keyboard that are usually reserved for laptops in price range that is $200-$300 higher (or more).  Having said that, it does have some faults that really take the shine off it's otherwise impressive feature list.  The first, and to me most annoying, is the Power on/off button. It is placed above the keyboard and to the left of the outstanding \"Beats\" audio speakers. This placement means it had to be recessed so that it is not activated when you close the lid. It is very narrow in design, and takes quite a bit of force to press down on, much more than any other laptop I've worked with in over 20 years. Most people will need to use the very tip of their finger; an uncomfortable sensation to say the least.  Even ladies with small hands will find this difficult at times and gentlemen with larger fingers will be frustrated daily with how difficult it is .HP makes up for this horrific power button by giving you some excellent BEATS audio speakers. Their low bass reproduction is equivalent to some high-end gaming laptops.  You also get a responsive touchscreen (a rarity at this price) that detects frame-to-screen swiping. This makes the un-loved Windows 8 experience a lot easier to deal with. Sadly, the screen is so glossy that any light source (lamps, tv's, windows, etc) is reflected right back into your eyes. The black bevel around the screen is even more glossy and compounds the effect. The touchscreen also adds (minimally) to the thickness and weight of the non-touchscreen version of this laptop. This really only matters if, like me, you go out and buy a hard clamshell case to protect your laptop, only to find out they are all made for the non-touchscreen version and won't fit on this variation of the Envy 4.Battery life is above-average. I averaged 6.5 hours with heavy web surfing and word processing activities.  100% Netflix activity cut that down to roughly 6 hours.  The power saving hibernation mode is excellent on this unit and returns you to a useable desktop in 7-8 seconds.  The vents for the CPU fan exhaust out the rear of the unit rather than sides. This means that actually putting this laptop in your lap, or on a couch, or on anything other than a truly flat surface like a table or non-flexible laptop pad WILL block the airflow and cause your unit to overheat quickly. While this is true for many \"lap\"-tops, it's particularly pronounced on the 1115dx because the air intake grill is also on the underside of the unit. Fan noise is minimal though. In a quiet room the fan at full speed won't be audible over even very soft audio you are watching and only minimally apparent otherwise.The backlit keyboard is above par for a chiclet island-style unit. The keys have enough travel that keyclicks feel sold. It's not a true full-size layout though (it's actually about 95% true key spacing) so very fast typers will often miss keys with their fifth (pinky) finger on the left hand.Summary: Despite some very annoying minor faults, the touchscreen version of the Envy 4 sleepbook is an outstanding value *IF* you know about, and are willing to live with, the areas where HP missed the mark a bit.  That being said, the features that make this laptop so good will likely be common place on ultrabooks a year from now at the same or better price point.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like it, very nice, worth the money", "Author": "Hinh Truong", "ReviewID": "R3E0YIE2A95AXU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I search many weeks for a reasonable laptop with good performance, price and light weight. I really love this laptop. Screen resolution is nice, clear and sharp, viewing angle is so so., it's power up super fast, light weight and fast (I don't play game so I can't comment on gaming), keyboard has back lid buttons, quite operation and do get warm if you use it for a while (little warm not hot), I expecting this due to core I5. The setup is straight forward, basically turn on, connect to wifi and done. It came with MS office 365 which only as a trial version. I activated it without any problem.

The time to wake up from sleep is just a second or two, and programs start instantly. The keyboard is responsive and the touchscreen is very well designed.  Although I don't use the trackpad very often, as the touchscreen is so much easier, I have no complaints with that either.  My only negative comments regarding the laptop are with the battery life and the screen itself.  The battery life on this laptop is quite poor in my opinion, only lasting 4 hours or so with constant use.  As such, this laptop needs to be close to a power outlet if you plan on using it for an extended period of time.  The touchscreen itself, although fantastic to use, does get smudged with fingerprints very quickly, and if you try to watch a movie on the laptop, these fingerprint smudges do get in the way.  The speakers work well.  They are louder than your typical laptop speakers, but like all laptop speakers, don't expect rich sound out of them.All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase.  windows 8 was built for touch, and using the touch features of this laptop make work as well as media consumption significantly more enjoyable and efficient.", "Date": "September 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Will be my laptop for many years to come", "Author": "Alex", "ReviewID": "RUGUFSNJ186EX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is everything I could have asked for.

What I don't appreciate is the fact that it gets to hot, even after brief use sessions, even when \"HP CoolSense\" is on... Firefox has frozen on me a couple of times, but I just hope it's something not related with the Ultrabook itself.Subject to further use and more complex tasks, I like this Ultrabook so far, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a little-over-basic laptop, that looks and feels nice, to send e-mails, surf the web, and regular office work.
