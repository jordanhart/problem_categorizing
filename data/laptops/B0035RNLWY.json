Nelson", "ReviewID": "RCPK7BM2VU6QO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for 7 years now.  I haven't had any major problems with it in all that time, except just recently my number six key stopped working.  Otherwise, it can be a little slow at times, loading web pages.  However, there's no problem getting into Word or Excel, etc.  I think it would be good at this point for a beginner who wants a cheap laptop to do emails and basic Word letters and perhaps keep track of their checkbook on Excel.  It's not overly complicated, but it doesn't have a LOT of memory for storing pictures, but a beginner would be ok with the space it has.  I keep Norton Antivirus on it and renew every year for $49 and it's been worth it.  The screen is big and clear, and you can hook a mouse to it, printers, scanners etc.  Hope that helps.", "Date": "July 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Old DELL", "Author": "normajeannelson", "ReviewID": "R3N3RELCF0F8UW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am pleased with the Laptop.
