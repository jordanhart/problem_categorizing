{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A perfectly good laptop for what most people do with laptops", "Author": "Kevin Jones", "ReviewID": "R1M3KC5GV8MOVL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Dell Inspiron 15 N5040 included 3gb of RAM and i3-2.53ghz cpu.  I do intend to upgrade the RAM to 8GB but will be adding that separately.  Dell's pricing on memory upgrades is absurd. so I just ordered 2x4GB (8GB) of Crucial memory on Amazon for $40.  Installing them just involves lifting the keyboard out.  For what most people do with their computers in the average day, this laptop is perfect.  A lot of people think they need the fastest, newest, most expensive computer out there and nowadays, that doesn't have to be the case.  Most of us aren't graphic designers or movie editors, so why spend hundreds more? For web browsing, email, skype calling, watching netflix, photo editing, and even movie editing (better with 8GB memory), I have had no issues at all.  It's a bit plain looking aesthetically, but I don't think that's a bad thing. Compared to the DELL XPS 15z, which I also own, it's only slightly thicker, which I found surprising since Dell has been touting how thin the XPS 15z is.  It does have an off center mousepad which I found annoying since I'm  used to them being centered.  I found myself inadvertently hitting the right button when reaching for the left button.  That is just a minor issue though.  Another down side is the battery life.  The standard battery doesn't last too long so keep the charger handy and stay near power outlets.  I've been getting about 3 hours of battery life while web browsing.  I would recommend this to product to anyone looking for an affordable everyday laptop.", "Date": "December 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Im Excited About My Dell", "Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "R1TO7MQ1HFEBWF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Is A Good Computer, And Overall A Good Bargain.But see their are things you have to adjust to.Here are the Pros:Big 15.6 Inch Screen.I don't know if it is safe to say this laptop's keys sort of resemble and feel like a mac's keyboard.anyways...The keys are a plus.Nice screen colors due to the default intel hd graphics.it is a lightweight machine sort of feels like it to me.for $400-$470 it is a hell of a bargain,it does its job.Cons: I haven't seen any at all.Highly Recommend.Enjoy.

Repeatable performance and Dell dependability in a sleek, easy to manage package.  The price point for comparable units makes this purchase a true bargain, coupled with Amazon ease of ordering and confidence in the Amazon market place partners makes it that much more enjoyable.  The seller, J-Tech Digital, was spot on perfect, caught a shipping error on my part and notified me by email soon after the order was placed.  The J-Tech Digital Customer Service Team corrected my oversight, shipped it ULTRA FAST and took the time to follow up after the sale.  Other retailers could learn a thing or two here.  Very impressive indeed.", "Date": "December 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good product according to the price", "Author": "jbendahan", "ReviewID": "R1V5Z73V37AJWH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good basic laptop. It has a lot of potential if you upgrade the ram memory.PROS:+ Got it brand new for under 500 US$.+ Intel core i3 is a really good microprocesor.+ DDR3 memory support up to 8GB of ram.+ Works well in high temperatures and it does not overheat like HP laptop's.CONS:- Touchpad sucks.- Only comes with 3GB of ram out of the box.Neutral:~ The keyboard is very basic.~ Screen is ok (it's advertised as a LED screen but i can't see the difference between this and a normal 2008 LCD screen).I'm happy with this product, but i'll definitely buy a memory upgrade to enhance the performance..", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "freshcope", "ReviewID": "R3T85EPKSXZKS0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have no complaints, although making the recovery discs didnt go well. Went thru 4 dvd's and then got a \"failure\" on the 4th disc. Called Dell support and the tech said this is a known problem and he said to use a 8GB flash drive. Sorry all mine are 4 or 6GB and i'm not going to go and spend money on a 8GB fd just to make up a backup Recovery.Battery life could be better, only get about 4 hours out of it on the basic mode...Over all this laptop is worth the money, it is fast and so far works great.", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Done with Dell", "Author": "Kathryn A. Hughes", "ReviewID": "R11WE1KQC7U1WJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought mine in mid 2012. iOversensitive touchpad. Cursor jumping all over. Called Dell tech line. Took over an hour and a supervisor to improve to the point it was at least usable. Over time problem crept back. Fair correction by adjusting keyboard & cursor speed down.Meanwhile, internet research showed many others had same problem. Again, problem slowly got worse for me. Computer once more to the point of unusable. Cursor jumps all over, closing/opening pages, deleting etc. unless cursor constantly manually repositioned.Called tech line again. Now I'm out of warranty, so no help unless I cough up over a hundred bucks. Called customer servicade. Too bad too sad, Pay or no help.Complaints about this issue go back to 2009. Dell knows it is a major issue. It has been an ongoing issue for me since buying the computer. They should have a free fix available for a problem THEY created.Otherwise, I loved this little laptop. But it is just a paperweight now.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "6 year old proof", "Author": "A. Gilbert", "ReviewID": "R2GZZM8D90S1MI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay, well quite honestly had I have been purchasing a computer this would not have been my primary choice.  I had a Toshiba and was perfectly content with this.  But, a relative purchased this & realized that they were completely computer illiterate so ended up buying this for next to nothing.  This computer has been the most durable computer I've ever ever had.  I have a tendency to break laptops, which is why I swore my next computer would be a desktop.  My first two laptops suffered broken screens (another Dell & a Compaq) my Toshiba's keyboard fried after typing a quick msg after getting out the shower with slightly damp hands.  This Dell that I am currently typing this review on has been dropped, things spilled on, and taken so many blunt hits.  Let me explain, I have a 6 year old technology hating computer killer.  She has successfully dropped this laptop from a kitchen table.  This computer hit so hard it knocked the hard drive out.  She then decided that instead of moving the computer after the hard drive was pushed back in, she was going to knock it off the couch because she wanted to sit down.  Nothing major happened to the computer.  So, computer killer decides she's going to spill her morning orange juice on it when she's watching Monster High on Youtube.  Screen changes colors and tweaks out making a hissing sound.  I thought that my PC avenger had finally toasted the laptop.  Ten minutes later, computer is working like new.  The computer then became a Play-Doh molder.  The buttons really took that hard.  They are impossible to take off without taking apart the computer, so we waited and waited and as the playdoh became more crusty it shank and fell out.  Keyboard works great.  I know this is probably a pointless argument for purchasing a laptop -- but I know there has to be other computer crushers in other households, and if you have one, this is your laptop.", "Date": "March 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Item description was off", "Author": "Brian C.
