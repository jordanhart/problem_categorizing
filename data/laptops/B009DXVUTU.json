{"Reviews": [{"Title": "So far so good", "Author": "Durandal", "ReviewID": "R1U7UIV48NFJ3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just received the unit today.  Sony had(has) a deal going with about half off on the 512GB SSD drive option so I picked one up fully loaded.. i7, 8GB RAM, and the 512GB SSD drive.  Everything has met expectations thus far except the screen.  I was really expecting a better screen than what I am seeing thus far.  Usually Sony has really nice vibrant screens but the screen is average I would say.  It is not bad by any means but nothing like a Mac or even some of the other higher end Windows laptops out there.  Ok other than that it is awesome. It cold boots in about 5 seconds and that is no exaggeration.  Everything is blazing fast and that is mostly due to Windows 8 and the SSD Drive.  So far I am very pleased with it other than the screen as I mentioned.  There is nothing else to mention as a negative yet.ProsBeautiful machineVery light weightNice keyboardLoaded with all the ports you will needBlue Ray driveThe only laptop I could find out there that has a 512 SSD option other than a Mac and right now you can get it for a song by comparisonComes with the excellent Sony Imagination Studio package.ConsScreen isn't as bright or as high resolution as it could beJust a follow up - 12/13 - After calibrating the screen using the Windows calibration tool and adjusting the color in the Intel control panel I was able to get the screen to look a lot better.  Still not retna quality by any means, but much, much better. On another note, I discovered after I brought it into the office that it doesn't have a laptop locking cable port.  That kind of sucks but still over all I am very pleased with the purchase.  If you can swing it get one with the SSD drive it just screams.", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sometimes great, always good...", "Author": "Jonathan Slager", "ReviewID": "R3V0ASQMO97PDP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a relatively inexpensive Sony product and honestly, there is not an electronics company anywhere that is as consistent as Sony in terms of quality at lower price and intelligent design over a broad range of electronics categories.  Enough gushing about Sony, though.Out of the box, the laptop is sleek, light (4lbs) and pretty.  My sister actually called this laptop \"sexy\".What's great about this laptop?  After the initial setup, inevitable updating of software and full charge of the battery, you get to see just how awesome the 32 GB cache memory is.  Booting up, as one reviewer said, \"literally takes 5 seconds\".  That's with a 5400 rpm hard drive.  And bringing the computer out of sleep is instantaneous (usually).Maintenance is easy with the \"Sony Vaio Care\" built right into the computer.  Sony provides 3 buttons called \"Assist\", \"Web\" and \"Vaio\".  I haven't messed with \"Web\" and \"Vaio\" yet, but the \"Assist\" button has 2 roles.  If you press it when the computer is shutdown, it automatically turns the computer on and brings up a menu of recovery and BIOS options.  No more trying to remember \"Is it F10 or F2 that gets me to the BIOS?  Is F8 Windows Recovery?\".  Assist takes you right there.  When the OS is already loaded \"Assist\" brings up the Sony Vaio Care menu, allowing you to tweak the basic settings for power management, sound, and a few other things.  I really have grown to love this design feature.There's almost no bloatware on the computer.  Just a trial of Kaspersky anti-virus and MS Office.  Both are easy to remove.I've already mentioned speed.  I do have to bring up that while power management settings don't seem to affect boot time, they do mess with performance.  At \"High Performance\" settings, the processor and memory handle most of the nonsense I throw at them.  Run Photoshop, Excel and Matlab at the same time...while listening to music? Not a problem.  Do the same thing with power management on \"Power Saving\", well, then you experience SOME jumps and lags in performance.  I'm not complaining.What's merely good?  I'm not a big fan of the keyboard.  I was spoiled on my last device which was a 15.6 inch ASUS lap with chiclet keys and a 10key. This thing doesn't have enough real estate for a ten key, but I find typing to be a little less responsive to what I'm used to.Speakers are good, but not great.  Music IS great through headphones, so the problem is NOT with the HD integrated sound card.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "OK computer", "Author": "Elyse", "ReviewID": "R80HBIU2VR0OX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this product 10 months ago so I'd have a reliable laptop on which to write my dissertation and move on to my post-graduation job. Unlike many of the smaller ultrabooks on the market, this one has a PGA port that lets me connect my laptop to give presentations (something I do often). I like the size and weight of this computer, and the battery life is pretty decent. To me, the best thing about this computer is how quietly and quickly it functions. My previous (non-ultrabook) laptops had loud hot fans and grunted and groaned every time I opened a program. This computer can open programs without seeming on the verge of exploding-- good job Sony, is that a trade secret? Also, because of it's thin size and good battery life, I am actually able to get work done on airplanes now. Some online reviews of this computer point out that the keyboard has a strange feel (which is true), but I have gotten used to using it and don't notice anymore. One thing I don't like is the mouse pad-- it has a hard time differentiating between left and right clicks, even when your fingers are at the very edges of the pad. I typically use a USB mouse instead. Another Amazon reviewer pointed out that this computer does not have a slot for your computer's cable lock to go in-- I just discovered that myself this week, and I wish I had known about it before, because I would like to be able to secure the computer at my desk in my new job.I have had a number of problems with this laptop that I think (but I'm not sure) are related to Windows 8 function. About once per day, the computer freezes and gives me a blue screen with the error message \"Critical process died.\" Since I pretty much only use this computer for Microsoft Office, Adobe Suite products, and non-complex internet use, I don't think it's an issue with low memory or anything related to how many processes are running. Fortunately, crashes only happens when I am using the internet, so if I am doing critical work or giving a presentation, I simply turn off internet connectivity and this seems to prevent the problem. It's still really annoying, and its frequency fluxuates depending on which new Windows 8.1 patch I have most recently downloaded. Again, I think this is Windows 8 sucking, but it might be a combination of this computer + Windows 8 sucking.I have a general word of warning for anyone who is a frequent user of Microsoft Office: if you have a choice, stay away from Office 365. I installed mine and it stopped working completely within 4 days. It was confused about my log-in information and when it couldn't get its information right, it locked up irreversibly. Even before it completely stopped being able to open its own programs, I realized 365 was not a good product for people who regularly use Office products for anything remotely professional. Luckily I was able to uninstall Office 365 completely and install an older (non-subscription) version that was free through my university. If you are reading this and trying to decide between Office 365 and an older version, I recommend an older version. 365 offers no functional improvements over previous versions: it's buggier, its new design seems geared toward young children, and it seems to lack (or effectively hide) some of the formatting features I relied on in previous versions of Word and Excel to prepare documents for publication. And you have to log-in with an internet connection to use it, which is annoying if you are trying to work on the road (or give a powerpoint presentation where you don't have wireless access!)", "Date": "June 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "So far so good .", "Author": "Roland Alexander", "ReviewID": "RLPV1BP5RRQ7T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fast, good resolution screen, good battery life, does not get too hot...........However, somehow I wished I had selected amodel / brand with the backlit keyboard.

After studying the design a bit, it is obviously not very rugged and not made for travel (it failed during a trip to Japan).  The screen is flimsy and the body easily distorts with movement.  I have ordered a new screen from laptopscreens.com and will install the new screen when it arrives and the give the laptop to my son.
