{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Insanely Fast, Great Screen", "Author": "Jonathan Wienke", "ReviewID": "R1US4511DQNHCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mine came with Windows 8, so I had to update to 8.1 myself. It's not that hard, but you have to go to the Windows Store instead of Windows Update. My update went smoothly, except something happened to the touchpad driver that disabled two-finger scrolling. But that was easily solved by downloading and installing the latest touchpad driver from Acer's web site.The Good:Insane speed. Since the OS is installed on a SSD, a cold boot takes less than 10 seconds from pressing the power button to getting the login screen. With 8GB of RAM, you don't really need a swap file. You can disable it and save wear on the SSD. You can also upgrade to 16GB if 8GB isn't enough. I also tried rendering some 1080p HD video in Premiere, and a 50-second clip rendered in about 5 seconds.The LCD screen is excellent. 1920x1080 resolution means HD videos can play without needing to be downsized to the screen resolution. It's bright, clear, and has a better-than-average viewing angle.The keyboard is full-sized has a standard layout and has an honest-to-God numeric keypad and arrow keys. The keys don't \"click\", but they do have a positive feel to them so you don't have to look at the screen to see if the keystroke registered.Upgradeability: There are empty slots for adding additional RAM and hard drives.64-bit Windows. This is kind of mandatory to take advantage of the 8GB of RAM. But when buying or installing software, you need to make sure you get the 64-bit version if available.The built-in audio is good, but not good enough to excite hardcore audiophiles. The headphone output is decent, but has a little bit of audible noise at higher volume levels. The built-in speakers sould like typical laptop speakers--decent in midrange and treble, but totally lacking any bass. If you're an audio snob, you'll want to use an external USB DAC/amplifier.The built-in multi-touch pad is larger than average, and has a nice set of configuration options. The only weird thing is that it doesn't have obvious left-right buttons; you just press on the lower left/right of the the pad to click. It takes a little getting used to, but means the pad can be made larger, because no room is taken up by dedicated buttons. I turned off tapping because a) it prevents accidentally clicking on stuff with the palm of your hand while typing, and b) it's redundant because you have to tap on the pad to click anyway. The buttons have a nice positive audible and tactile click, which I prefer to a tap on a rigid surface with no feedback.The Bad:They forgot to include indicator lights to show if CAP LOCK and NUM LOCK are on or off. So if you're typing in a password, you can get an error without being able to tell why. Are you kidding me? LED's cost maybe a nickel each!It has a DVD drive instead of a Blu-Ray. This kind of defeats the purpose of having that HD-res screen. At least there are USB ports for attaching external drive(s).The Ugly:Windows 8. I would have preferred Windows 7. At least 8.1 lets you bypass most of the Metro user interface silliness.The bottom line:Overall, I can forgive the minor design & configuration sins given the extremely fast performance and the excellent screen and keyboard. 5 stars for now, unless it breaks.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Great Laptop with a great price", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R10B5W4C58KOOH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Laptop for its price, Gtx 760  allows you to play almost all games in high settings. I played Assassins creed 4 on high and it was beautiful with no stuttering at all; once i tried it on ultra settings however it started stuttering a bit but no that bad. The SSD makes the computer extremely fast that windows literally starts up in exactly 4 seconds (i counted). of course windows 8 ruins it a little but its not that bad. here are a quick brief on cons and pros.Pros: SSD makes your computer super fast, a very good deal considering the price and components, The Laptop NEVER gets hot ( i played AC4 for 5 straight hours on high setting and the laptop is still cool to the touch.Cons: No back-lit Keyboard but i think the keys are made so that you can still see them in the dark, a little heavy but that's what you would expect from a 17\" gaming laptop, Lots of Bloatware but i don't really mind since uninstalling them doesn't take anytime.All in all it's a very good laptop for it's price (999.99$ but it may get more expensive since its on a sale) if you are on a budget and want a good gaming laptop that can handle the most demanding gamesUPDATE! it's now may 26th; i have had this laptop for more than 6 months already and it's still working like a beast!! only problem i have ever noticed is that the Bluetooth software is not working but that can be fixed by downloading it from microsoft i think. also another issue i got is when i am playing a game or watching a video online if i leave the laptop for a minute or 2 without touching any button or even moving the mouse pointer the video stutters greatly like it just dropped to 5 fps but the sound keeps working as normal, as soon as i move the mouse or press any button the fps shoots straight back to nominal instantly; i think i was able to fix this issue once but can't really remember how now that it showed up again but doing a system recovery will definitely fix it or reinstalling the graphic card drivers since i think the problem lies with the graphic card and the built in Intel card switching out. other than that the laptop is still working perfectly, no overheating even after 6 months, no viruses at all, just make sure to update windows 8 to 8.1, it makes life much easier", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best laptop I could find for the price.", "Author": "Komotonoto", "ReviewID": "R2TNEPF41BJ14M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to delete all factory partitions in the mSATA and install windows 7. Then for the graphics driver, you just need to get it from the manufacture website (Nvidia). It boots up in seconds and you can put 2 more hard drives in it! So it's like you get a desktop replacement! Only small problem is that it is a very big laptop so you may need a bigger bookbag to carry or whatever. The mouse clicking is a bit annoying since it didn't come with seperate mouse buttons. The battery doesn't last long as much but if you are going to be gaming, I don't see why anyone would play on their battery..", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT.. so far :D", "Author": "MovieGoer", "ReviewID": "R1ECS1Z6PHY6SK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've only had this laptop for a few days now.. so I'll probably update this review later.. but so far.. LOVE IT! For the price ($1k), I think it was a pretty good deal. The SSD makes this thing screaming fast. Boots up in less than 10 seconds from totally shut off, to the login screen :) The graphics card is pretty ridiculous. Can't wait to see what this baby can do after I get my Steam library back up to par! :)UPDATE!!! So I've had it now for around 2 months now! I LOVE this laptop! It honestly is such a great feeling having something that is so dang fast. In addition, the screen is BEAUTIFUL and having the nice 17 inch screen is a plus when gaming.. its probably the main reason I was looking at Aspires in the first place as opposed to an HP Envy or something. I will throw in a CON or two that wasn't so apparent up front. After playing games on it for an hour or 2, the place when you rest your LEFT hand under the keyboard starts to get warm. Never to the point that it burns.. but to the point that its annoying and I lift my hand up for a few seconds every now and then. Another thing that is kinda sucky is no backlit keyboard.. but thats a minor thing.One thing I'm not positive about.. but when I play league of legends and get in the middle of a big team battle.. right when someone dies.. I get these brief second-long lag spikes once in a while. I don't believe its my internet (25mbps, 90ping) and RAM is usually fine.. I'm thinking that the processor gets a little taxed at times like this.. I'm not sure.ANYWHO.. I still LOVE this laptop overall and it is honestly really great to game on and do other stuff :)", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "opens fast", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R2PUT7N01EL1O0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It boots up in than a minute.

This isn't a huge deal as I'm typically using a mouse anyway.Picked this bad boy up on cyber monday for $999. I had been shopping for a new laptop for a few months and everything with this kind of specs was in the $1300+ range. This is my first Acer and it seems really well built. It is a heavy laptop but you're not buying this type of computer for the portability.

( be sure to know which one you are downloading, there are 2 types, only one is compatible to your brand new computer, call them if needed, I did it, ;]  )ok now, why I gave 5 stars?Pros:  AWESOME computer, the fastest I ever seen, I swear, it turns on in 4 seconds, awesome screen, great speed, handles any type of game on high settings, does not heat up, it is silent, it is beautiful, and it saves a lot of power. it has actually 2 video cards.1 video card is the integrated intel 4600, and the other is the geforce gtx760 2gb integrated ddr5. (you will have to chose when to use it, when you right click a program it lets you chose which video card you wanna use with it) ( you ca also change this setting on the nvidia settings)Cons: 1- as the first comment said, there are no lights indicating the caps lock or the num-lock, it is not a big problem, just annoying.2- I don't know what seems to be the problem, but I have a wireless mouse, that is normal and used to be normal when I was using with the computer on windows 8, but once I upgraded to windows 8.1 everytime I plug it on the usb port, I have a blue screen. I tried on all usb ports, I tried plugging it turned on and off, and I still got the same blue screen with the message: kernel_security_check_failure. it only happens to that mouse, I got others that work just fine.3- The keyboard is not that great, maybe a month ago I realized that the space bar was not functioning properly, if I press it too much in the corner and too soft sometimes it does not work, while writing this review it has happened to me about 4 to 5 times... also not a huge deal, but still very annoying.overall this is a great computer, you won't regret. when i was searching for mine I wanted a touchscreen one, that was a must for me until I saw this one. I searched for about 4 months before buying a new computer, read every review I could possible find. There was no other computer that matched this one. for the price and the power, it was the best deal ever. not even touchscreen mattered anymore.

I would have preferred if the GFX card was a stand alone nvidia without optimus. I have owned previous machines with optimus and after the manufacturer stops supporting the machines, the newer nvidia direct drivers can often cause problems and in my case, cause BSOD issues.The most notable issue is after i update the OS to Windows 8.1 Update 1, when you restart the machine, from the time the screen goes black to the boot/windows loading screen popping up is about 2 - mins long. You machine didnt freeze or anything, just the loading of the UEFI between windows shutting down and starting back up takes really freaking long.Other than that, excellent machine and the Screen is the crown jewel imo.Cheers.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast, large HD screen and number pad Quality control issues.", "Author": "Nicholas S.", "ReviewID": "R326FX8DGFC4JQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "After we got this unit I wanted to put my own image of Windows on it.First issue is with the UEFI Bios. New technology for Windows 8. The Windows key is burnt into the BIOS. Not a problem unless there is a Linux user somewhere. Just reformat the drive other than GPT.Second issue was the keyboard. It has 2 J keys and 3 ALT keys. The keys work fine and as intended but the key caps were wrong where there should be a semi-colon there sits a \"J\" key. Still works as a semi-colon same with one of the 3 ALT keys one is a CTRL key and works as such. Not worth complaining about but it is a quality control issue that is so simple it makes you wonder what else could happen or is wrong. Other than that its a great performing laptop.

If you can manage to install win 7 and have it work properly then I'd recommend it.

There might be a few out there where you can disable the new secure boot but this is not one.No a recommendation -  the idea is to reserve the ssd for the system and apps that can really use the extra speed and save the hdd for storage.  One way to help is this:Start the install with a user that will be deleted..Then with regedit  change the registry so all new users will be stored in D:/users/The create your real user and delete the first and now all user data will be kept on the larger hdd.Also a fast external hdd hooked to to the USB 3.0 makes for some awesome storage.You have to hate Bill Gates and Steve for being such losers.
