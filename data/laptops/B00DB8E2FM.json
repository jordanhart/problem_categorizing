{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Poor poor quality", "Author": "Sridhar Krishnamurthy", "ReviewID": "R30ONO2EFU54VU", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this computer from the Microsoft store during the previous Thanksgiving sale.  It does look sleek and the key pad looks like that of mac book and the touch screen is nice on Windows 8.  But you can't enjoy any of those on this laptop.  Every time you touch it, you will repent its purchase.  Laptop's build quality is unbelievably poor and made of very cheap plastic.  Within a few months of purchase the mouse pad started to come away from the base.  Another few months, the plate holding the keyboard and the base started to separate.  Forget about typing anything more than a few sentences.. with this keyboard, you'll never know for sure if you've pressed the key or not.Will never buy Asus product again.  Neither should you buy this cheap cheap.. cheap junk.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good, but no SSD usage(?)", "Author": "Roberto Hernandez", "ReviewID": "R19D6U9DT334CR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It works and boots as expected.Processor is even enough to play Minecraft on decent graphical settings.I've taken a star off because the SSD/Intel Rapid Start Tech doesn't seem to work; The OS isn't installed to it, nor is start-up as fast as it should/could be. I've tried toying with Intel Rapid Start and it just denies me usage of it as if my SSD doesn't exist.I've contemplated wiping the drive and re-installing Windows 8 to the SSD, but I noticed there's only about 17GB actually usable on the SSD, so maybe it won't go so well.Overall, great product; would recommend.", "Date": "February 27, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "used", "Name": "Asus S400C - Ultrabook 14\" i3-3217u 1.8GHz Touch-Screen Laptop - 4GB Memory - 500GB Hard Drive - Black/Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41ZtAd2fFVL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DB8E2FM"}}
