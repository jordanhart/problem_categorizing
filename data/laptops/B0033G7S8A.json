And you can start typing and loading programs as soon as the desktop appears!VPCF112FX comes installed with a 7200 RPM 500 GB Seagate Momentus HDD.  It is a superb hard disk drive and you will not hear any noise coming from it.The system fan is nice and quiet.  Some notebooks have loud fans, this one is very quiet.The nVidia graphics are very awesome.  Graphics display has no lag. I would like to have seen 1 GB of dedicated video memory but the standard 512 MB is plenty for most programs.The HD audio sound and speakers are crisp.There are a few issues you need to know before deciding whether it's right for you.1)  Sony VAIO Technical Support lacks the know-how to resolve minor software issues: a) the Sony VAIO Care and VAIO Update utility software has numerous program bugs and every time I try to convey the issues to Sony Technical Support they are totally inept at resolving the issues much less reporting the problems for future product fixes; b) the Alps Touchpad Control Panel for VAIO which runs in the taskbar has a bug which causes it to \"hang\" on system shutdown, Windows 7 resolves the \"hang\" by performing a forced shutdown of the filename Apoint.exe.  It is a small but annoying issue that I have reported in emails and phone support but I don't think Sony's tech support really cares about this issue and customers will have to hope that a new version will resolve this minor bug.2)  There are two points in the product specs that need clarification: a) the system comes installed with 4 gigabytes of DDR3 memory running at a maximum speed of 667 MHz.  The system can be upgraded to 8 gigabytes of DDR3 memory running at a maximum of 1333 MHz.  You will not get RAM speed 1333 MHz from with your factory installation unless you buy from [...] and order an upgrade;The specs are misleading and appear as follows:  * Installed : 4GB (2GBx2)  * Type/Speed : DDR3/1333MHz  * Maximum : 8GB b) the system comes with three (3) USB 2.0 ports, one of these ports is a combo port for eSATA/USB 2.0.The specs are misleading and appear as follows:USB Port(s) : 2 (USB) 2.0, 1 (eSATA)If you have an external USB HDD with a eSATA port, you are going to love this combo port!  Data moves lightening fast.3)  The Blu-ray combo optical drive shipped in the factory installation is way too slow given the CPU and memory in this system.  I purchased this system for DVD video editing and burning.  But the specs do not indicate that the DVD burner can only burn at 4x max speed.  The technical specs are confusing and lead you to believe that 4x pertains to the Blu-ray speed.The specs are misleading and appear as follows:# BD-R DL Read : 4x max# BD-R Read : 4x max# BD-RE DL Read : 4x max# BD-RE Read : 4x max# BD-ROM Read : 4x max# Blu-ray Disc(tm) Support : Read Only (BD-ROM)All it says in the specs is:# CD Support : Read / Write (CD/-R/-RW)# DVD Support : Read / Write (DVD\u00b1R/\u00b1RW/\u00b1R DL/-RAM)Sony could easily have installed a 16x DVD burner/40x CD burner at a marginal price increase I think given the drive is a Sony Optiarc BD drive which they manufacture at a nominal cost I'm sure--so if you want a faster DVD/CD burner you will need to order an upgrade at [...] to get a faster combo optical drive.DO NOT GET ME WRONG, I AM VERY PICKY, THIS IS A GREAT NEW MODEL FROM SONY.  SONY JUST NEEDS BETTER TECH SUPPORT PEOPLE TO LISTEN TO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK AND FIX SOME VERY MINOR VAIO UTILITY PROGRAM BUGS.", "Date": "June 5, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0033G7S8A"}}
