I'm using it primarily for writing and internet access, and originally considered getting a chromebook.  However, this laptop has substantial internal storage, enough RAM to do basic photo editing, and can stream vidoes through the HDMI port to a TV, all of which, in my opinion, more than justifies the additional $100.  So far, I have no complaints, although the Windows 8 operating system does seem to be more intended for a touchscreen, and takes a little getting used to.  Additionally, the touchpad is very sensitive, but again, it depends on what you are used to and I've already adapted to mine.  It's very light and small, but also very solid; both the hinge and the keypad seem remarkably well-designed, which is important to me because I've had issues with Acer keys popping off in the past.  They're redesigned with this model though, and it's a major improvement. For the price, at the time I bought it, it seemed by far the strongest contender, and I can highly recommend this product.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "pretty good", "Author": "Brian baker", "ReviewID": "R1KX818ECXOKP8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "works for what i bought it for. windows 8 sucks without touch screen though. overall i'm happy with it though.", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a Fan of Windows 8", "Author": "Charles W Crain", "ReviewID": "RZR4O7MJR1PGU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It was cheap. It had the drive space I needed. I spend a lot of time working on projects in places with no wi-fi (trust me, they still exist) so I couldn't buy a Chromebook. I still needed something small and light. I am still plowing through the bloatware, trying my best to eliminate what I do not use. What peeves me the most about this laptop is the constant updates from both Acer and Microsoft trying to get me to sign up for an account and enter their cloud. It slows down the entire computer and does nothing but annoy me. I may not be totally tech savvy, but I know enough to regularly check for updates to products I already own without having to go through a sales pitch for the newest, best thing.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "I have had little itty bitty android tablets that were faster than this thing.", "Author": "Craig Sheets", "ReviewID": "R3FZTFPS360LC8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This tablet was EXTREMELY slow.

Run don't walk to a different offering.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"price pincher\"", "ReviewID": "RWNYY0BPT3WZH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have used PC's since 1982 - and though my primary pc is a powerbook - I work with an organization that is PC only.  So to be able to connect from home - I must use a PC.  At a little more than $300 this cute little guy seemed like a good idea.Acer has a great reputation - I've had wonderful luck with them in the past.  So I had an easy choice.Careful.  It has a trackpad from hell.  Imagine every few sentences having it pull down the \"right click\" menu.  Imagine actually only about 2 hours of use time.  Imagine a flawed operating system, that is further corrupted by a printing menu that decides to pop up for no apparent reason.  What about all the automated marketing messages the cute little fellow sends you?  Norton's marketing demon lives in the machine as well threatening viruses if you don't buy.So here's how I really feel - it is perhaps the worse IT experience I've ever had.  Burdensome.  I will find a substitute - or perhaps will use a different keyboard plugged in with a mouse before I give up all together.  Before you buy this miserable little machine - use it for twenty minutes - try a display copy at a local retail store.  Type a short note.  You too will be ready to throw it across the store in no time.How does stuff like this get designed.  It is a horrendous user experience.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Much better than a chromebook", "Author": "Christian De Freitas", "ReviewID": "RAKJEDNOYQOI7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me begin, for who don't know, what's a ChromeBook. It's a Laptop that runs Google Chrome OS as Operating System. It forces you to keep most of your files online. All the data is stored in the \"cloud\" and can only be accessed by an internet connection.If you have used Chrome as your browser, you may know those apps, those are the ones that comes up when you click in the upper left hand side icon labeled, duh! Apps.On the positive side:* Since everything is on the cloud, you can access it from any computer.* If your chromebook gets lost/damaged/stolen you won't have to worry about losing all your personal files, apps and settings.* If you want to use your  Chromebook offline, you can download offline versions of Web apps, such as Gmail and several apps. Since the selection of WebApps is very limited, I wouldn't change a full computer for a Chromebook.On the negative side:* There's nothing you can't do on a normal laptop running Chrome.* Similarly prices as lower end laptops.* They use slow chipset (even lower end laptops has better CPU).* It's a laptop with just a web browser.* There are many programs that run on Windows/OS X/Linux. A Chromebook can't run any of them.* YOU CAN'T PRINT DIRECTLY OF A CHROMEBOOKA Chromebook is around 250 usd, has 16GB or 32GB of storage, Celerons CPU (samsung uses Exynos) and 2GB or 4GB of RAM http://amzn.to/1iFdkp9Excellent alternatives similarly priced:* Asus touchscreen windows 8 laptop, AMD A4, 2GB RAM, 320gb HDD http://amzn.to/1lFqbam* HP Pavilion  touchscreen windows 8 laptop, AMD A4, 2GB RAM, 320gb HDD http://amzn.to/1iPz9l1 (comes with Microsoft Office 2013 Home & Student)* Asus UBUNTU laptop, Intel Celeron, 2GB RAM, 320GB HDD http://amzn.to/1fyPQ4LAnd the king of the category:This laptop you're watching Acer Aspire V5, Windows 8.1 laptop, AMD E1200, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDDAs you can see, do you really have a reason to buy a chromebook over this at the same price?", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Chose another Acer V5, this is too underpowered to achieve anything even simple", "Author": "tconnor", "ReviewID": "R3R6BDEGGSN0MM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this for travelling & as  was in a hurry placing an order I didn't look too closely at the computer spec. I stupidly thought all modern computers would be fast....wrong! This netbook has a 1.0GHz processor which means it does everything very slowly, overtask it & it will crash. On the plus side it has 500GB of hard drive memory which is great for storing all the GoPro footage I am taking. As far as editing that footage I will have to do this when I get home as this netbook simply is not up to the task. Even the internet is slow in loading in fast internet access areas. It will do as my travel netbook but man am I complaining about it a lot! I would steer clear of this; If I wasn't in South America I would be returning this but unfortunately I will not be back home until after the return date. At least it is small & light though so not too much of a burden to carry around.
