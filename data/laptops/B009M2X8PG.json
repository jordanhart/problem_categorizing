You get good hardware for the money, but the nightmare was a holy nightmare.  After unistalling all the \"multi-gesture\" features and software, it's at least usable.  I can't recall if I ended up using a synaptic driver or default windows drivers after it was all said and done.  It was for a customer, and I told her to return it to me if it was unusable.  So far she has not.  Maybe everybody is not as picky as me?", "Date": "September 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Asus laptop", "Author": "Jason", "ReviewID": "R2OMISSS3NQ5T6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my kids, they love it so far.

An entirely unintuitive operating system.

I have had no problems whatsoever with my Dell in all that time. I fully expected and wanted to buy a new Dell with a 17 inch screen but the prices seemed a bit high. By the way I'm a \"Make or buy American\" guy and I have been in Austin, Texas where the Dell headquarters is/was(?). I made the minor mistake of asking one of our computer whizzes at work what he thought about Dells and he gave me that vague look and speech \"Dells are OK\" but then he said \"I've heard a lot of good stuff about ASUS\". So I looked up ASUS up on the internet and all I saw was an address in California...my search stopped there and I thought I was getting an American brokered (at least) computer. ASUS was cheaper because it's all foreign.Epilogue:-The DVD player skips and burps, even on brand new disks.-Going to the Start screen interrupts or stops other functions.-I'm not sure if the Instant On feature is giving me the good and refreshing benefits of a cold start.-It just doesn't seem that much faster than my 4 1/2 year old Dell laptop.I'm just kinda' surprised.", "Date": "February 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009M2X8PG"}}
