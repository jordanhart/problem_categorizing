{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Blazing fast, durable, practical.", "Author": "zlh5009", "ReviewID": "R3DJLEASG1OMJE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this \"enterprise\" model computer because I couldn't find anything worth buying in the consumer computer market.  I have a background in technology and am very picky about my electronics.  I've had this computer for several months, and long story short, it's awesome!  Here's why:-Matte finish screen: When  you take this computer outside, you can still read it.-Screen has a rubber seal all the way around it.  It closes firmly and keeps dust out of the keyboard when its traveling-Clear webcam and built-in mic, for high quality webchat.  Business model PCs depend on this technology, so its solid.-Proper keyboard key spacing.  This keyboard feels natural.  I had very few missed keys from the moment I started typing on it.  In fact, I'm typing this review on it right now.-Good touchpad location.  The touchpad is located between the \"G\" and \"H\" keys, where it is supposed to be.  That way, the pads at the base of my thumbs never hit it and mess up my typing by clicking something.  It is amazing how hard it is to find computers like that.-Touchpad is large!  I don't have to keep scratching on it like a frantic dj to get the mouse across the screen.-Still has buttons for clicking.  The new touchpads with the corner of the touchpad as a button are neat and get you some more touchpad real estate, but aren't as durable as apple's clickable touchpads, so I don't trust them.  Stick with the buttons till they figure that out.-Durable chassis.  Most of the computers I looked at in the store were a little \"floppy\" when you grabbed opposite corners of the frame.  Not this one.  It is rock solid, so you know it's doing a good job protecting your motherboard from breakage.-No touchscreen:  I am not a fan of touchscreen glass on a PC, or trying to read through my own finger grease.  I'll make the transition to touchscreen computers when they finally invent that cool holographic technology you see on Iron Man.  Until then, a keyboard, mouse, and linux beat a touchscreen windows 8 pc in efficiency any day.-Powerful and efficient.  The 4000 series i5 uses very little power, and screams like a banshee when you need it to.  This computer is very well matched between components.  It doen't seem to have any one thing choking it back - which is why it really flies.  From time to time, I have some very intensive computing tasks to do, and this thing breezes through them, and even still has enough power left over for me to surf while I wait.-Sleek looks.  This thing has clean lines and the spaced out keys.  It looks good open or closed.There are so many more that I could list, but this review is too long already.  The bottom line is this:  If you're looking for a traditional working laptop that can handle whatever you throw at it, this is a great choice.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$759.00", "Features": "HP ProBook Notebook - Core i5, 4GB, 15.6\"", "Name": "ProBook 15.6\" LED Notebook - Intel Core i5 i5-4200U 1.60 GHz", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413CKheG15L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00FE61H4S"}}
