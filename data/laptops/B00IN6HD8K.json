{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty fast, but buggy and annoying system", "Author": "Matthew Schwarz", "ReviewID": "R1XXEUI1M3ZMYQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Our old laptop crashed, so we got this one at the recommendation of the salesman at the store.  On the plus side, it's a lot faster than our other laptop - I can now check facebook and browse Amazon without waiting forever for things to load up.  On the other hand, we've had to take it in once already for crashing - it just froze and wouldn't come back on (we only got it two months ago, we got good antivirus installed, and I don't believe anyone in the household went to any shady websites or clicked any dubious links in our email), and (although we got it running again) the tech claimed there were no viruses on it.  Also, often when I pick it up to put it in my lap, it shuts down and reboots itself (maybe once a day or so).  It doesn't take too long to reboot, but this is still annoying in a two-month old computer!Another annoyance is the Windows 8.1 operating system.  I haven't found anything good about it yet, but it's different enough from our old operating system to be a pain in the butt.  If you put the curser to the side of the screen, a useless popup window shows up, and there's also an alternate desktop that comes up at times and you have to scroll to the regular one.  The popup window to do things like turn off the computer is kind of hidden, so you have to find it all over again, and we had to change some settings to get it to stop switching to the alternate desktop window every time I tried to move the cursor.  The built in mousepad, like our old laptop, likes to act as if you clicked it when you didn't, meaning it has a tendency to open random links when you're on the internet and not careful about where you leave your arrow.  Also, to left-click you have to click the very left-bottom corner of the mousepad, and if you don't click far enough over it doesn't register.  This sounds like a minor issue, but it gets kind of annoying - again, the old \"have a specific button for that\" system was fine, why change it and replace it with something worse?  Because that's how technology works, is why!Anyway, overall a good enough computer with nice speed for internet (haven't used it for a lot else), but has some issues and the need to fix what ain't broken (e.g. mouse and Windows new technology) is annoying.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$759.99", "Features": "Intel Core i7-4700MQ Processor (6M Cache, up to 3.40 GHz)\n12GB DDR3 1600MHz memory\n1.0TB (5400 RPM, Serial ATA   Windows 8.1\nDVD-SuperMulti drive (+/-R double layer)\nHD Webcam and Microphone", "Name": "Toshiba S55-A5188 15.6\" Intel Core i7-4700MQ Processor (6M Cache, up to 3.40 GHz) 12GB RAM, 1TB HD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412Hy2UGgxL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IN6HD8K"}}
