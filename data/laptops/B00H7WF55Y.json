But in turn the computer is just slow and unreliable. I can't even open the Web browser without issues.All in all I would gladly pay more for a another computer than buy this again.", "Date": "February 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Only 4 stars because I was able to speed mine up", "Author": "Lauren Glenn", "ReviewID": "R3IQ3Z6D01M6O5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this up at BestBuy for $250 mainly because I wanted a full computer that fits in my purse in case work calls me.  Yes, the computer is slow when it first boots up which is mostly due to all of the crap that ACER puts on it.  Here's what I did:Remove McAfeeRemove WildTangent gamesRemove all of the ACER appsRemove Simtoo (or whatever that's called)Install Diskeeper 12Sure, it's not a blazing fast machine but I needed something that could play HD videos and browse the web while connecting to work now and then.The keyboard takes a little getting used to and the battery life is less than ideal but I needed something with high storage capacity, a keyboard, and is portable.  It uses Windows 8.1 with a resolution of 1366x768 so it's decent enough.  The screen is touch screen also.Still, I'm happy with it but that was after getting rid of all of that bloatware and installing Diskeeper to defragment the drive effectively.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not a MacBook Air--but...", "Author": "M. G. Ball \"MGB\"", "ReviewID": "R1AUQ8RIVYWO1A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's about a third the price--and mine works like a charm.  True, it's slow getting started--busy, I think, collecting updates.  But once it gets going, this laptop  is as speedy as my internet connection happens to be.Battery life isn't wonderful/wonderful, but I don't mind plugging it in when I am using the computer for an extended period of time.  The charging cord is easy enough to bring along; the brick is small.The laptop itself is small, light, and highly portable.  The screen is bright.  My only real complaint is the lack of any indicator that the CAPS LOCK is on.And now for the biggest plus: The full-size keyboard is a delight!  Although a clumsy touch typist, I make few mistakes when writing at length on this laptop.  It is a PLEASURE to use this keyboard!", "Date": "February 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's slow", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2K5Z5F19TPGHQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The processing is so slow and alot of stuff crashes.

I bought this computer to replace an old Dell Vostro 1510 running Windows Vista because it was slow and isn't compatable with the newest versions of explorer and chrome. Well this new Acer with Windows 8.1 is even slower.

It's slow that molasses in December.  Though, I loved the size and look of it, I couldn't bear the horrible slowness involved with every task this computer performed.  The track pad was less than responsive.  Thank god Amazon's return process is so simple.  I gave this computer 48 hours before I clicked the return button.
