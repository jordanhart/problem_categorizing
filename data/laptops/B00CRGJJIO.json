As listing all of the pro's of this laptop would take a lot longer than listing the cons, lets just skip to the bad stuff. It's a black laptop, so the grease on your fingers is visible on it. A previous review stated that the left click on the touchpad was too loud. I agree completely. If you're going to play Cookie Clicker in church, people will look at you funny. Other than that, there have been no downsides whatsoever. The onboard chipset runs all of the games that I play at acceptable framerates (Dota 2 on low runs at about 45fps steadily). I multi-task, browse the internet, play games, write reports, draw up spreadsheets, all at the same time. No slowdown, no nonsense. I would definitely recommend this laptop, and in fact I already have.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Richard Miller", "ReviewID": "R3555O5I9E2WPU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the price I got (350) this laptop has all the specs i need to be successful in college and maybe beyond.In my first couple days, my only complaint is the loud mouse button....", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop.", "Author": "Sylvia A.

I have had it about one month with no issues so far. IT does everything for my needs. It will be smart to get rid of Win. 8 and install  Win. 7 on it as I did. Its a easy task. Backlight keys would have been made this laptop very popular for typing and even light-gaming. The only thing to mention as downside is the cheap/load sound of touchpad L/R clicks is annoying. Get a mouse! Overall I recommend this laptop.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for Non-Gamer", "Author": "Lucy N.", "ReviewID": "R2FOGMUOAXFV6S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my mom.  It has Windows 8 which worried me a little, but it was actually easy to set up.  The best part of this computer is that it has a USB3 port & also has a DVD-RW drive.  A lot of the cheaper laptops don't come with a DVD/CD drive, making installing old software impossible.  This allowed me to install software I already owned (Office & Photoshop) without having to purchase new copies from the cloud!  I gave the computer to my mom for Xmas and had all of the software that she would need installed, showed her how to customize the layout and she's off and running.  Still not a fan of Windows 8, but a fan of the computer overall :)", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great hardware at this price level.", "Author": "F. Klein", "ReviewID": "RHQHTH9WWGMHN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for $349 on Amazon with free shipping. I buy computers based on components rather than brand. This computer has an I3 processor that is significantly faster than the usual processor at this price level. The 4GB of RAM is more than adequate. The main complaint I have with the computer is Windows 8 and the way Dell has scattered stuff across multiple partitions. Windows 8 can be improved by downloading something called \"Classic Shell\" (find the website by Googling) that gives you a standard \"Start Menu\" reminiscent of XP, Vista, or Windows 7.Another issue, for those who buy Windows computers to dual boot them with Linux is that the UEFI (standard on newer Windows computers) makes this more difficult. I was able to install Ubuntu 13.04 after defragmenting, then shrinking the main C: partition within Windows using Disk Manager, then running the Ubuntu install disk using Legacy mode in the Bios. To get to Legacy mode, you have to press F8 as the computer starts to boot, then searching through the fields until you can enable it. Then, when the computer reboots, you have to press F12 to allow booting from the 13.04 DVD (13.04 install disk takes up 800MB--more than most CD's). I then had to use \"Boot Repair,\" a Lubuntu based application downloadable and burned to a CD from the Ubuntu website. A warning to Ubuntu users:  12.04 did not support either wired or wireless internet with this computer. I have not tried wired with 13.04 as wireless worked well. Now that Ubuntu is installed alongside Windows, I can go to my usual practice of using Windows only to back up my IPOD.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for price", "Author": "Katherine Majzner", "ReviewID": "R2YFENVDK82W7O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this computer for school, and it works perfectly. The mouse pad is loud, so I use a mouse and the covering is really cheap. The cheap casing makes it really uncomfortable to rest your arms on, and I can only type for so long until I have marks on my arms and it  hurts too much to use.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good for normal use", "Author": "Ronak", "ReviewID": "R3QFN5P2QAP5RA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Its cheap.

I have it for a year now. For its size, it is pretty light. I have a shoulder problem but I still manage to carry this computer everywhere without aching pain. It is super affordable. Our company choose this computer for all of us to do our day to day basis computer work. I love the number pad like old school key board. I'm a young professional and I like how sleek it looks. I was a little worried because I owe Mac before that. Now I have put away in a storage and focus on this one.One negative thing I ran into is virus. I had my computer unprotected from virus for about four months and eventually it got invaded. I had to upload a few cleaning programs to bring it back together. Right now it is still in a recuperating status, need 10% more work to clean it up completely--well, hopefully.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "Jhon Ewards Clociel Mata", "ReviewID": "R2H7XKX6LY6QTX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "excellent, very fast, compact, the keyboard is great, the windoes 8 is difficult to adapt not very hot, the speed of connection to the wifi is excellent, I loved", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Like it but..", "Author": "Kenneth Sumner", "ReviewID": "R1FHUCSEIH8HLW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice fast computer.

Uhrich", "ReviewID": "R8R1OVM6SGF01", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For the price, this is a fantastic laptop.  It's great for everyday use.  It's pretty fast for being an Core i3.  The DVD writer is pretty basic, but it gets the job done.  The two USB 3.0 ports are a plus and makes things like backups a quick and painless job.  It's not going to play the latest and greatest games, but then again, no one would buy a laptop for that, but it will play some older and less graphics intensive games.  Wirelessly, it works like a champ.  Quick startup and shutdown.  I swapped out the HDD for an SSD and it is now on par with my home built desktop with regard to speed and responsiveness.  With the SSD, I am now getting almost six hours of battery time.  The touchpad is sensitive, but not too sensitive, and the keyboard is nice and big, with all the keys you would find on the standard keyboard.  The monitor is crisp and bright.  The speakers, like all laptop speakers, leave a lot to be desired, so listening to music on this probably won't be something you do on a regular basis, but they are adequate.  All in all, this is a great computer.  This is my first Intel processor based computer in almost twelve years, and I am impressed.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Item Damaged", "Author": "Harinath Reddy", "ReviewID": "R3NJ9OBYHPQPND", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I found background light on Upper right corner on screen.

I will admit, I'm not a fan at all of Windows 8 but, any person can get over that and still use the laptop with some ease. The black matte finish of the laptop can become \"decorated\" with the mess of oily fingerprints and the laptop itself is fragile as it is lightweight.
