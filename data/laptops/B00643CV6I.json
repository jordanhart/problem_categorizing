It's a budget laptop for sure.  The screen will be difficult to see in direct sunlight as it reflects a lot. You can make it a decent cheap machine though by adding in some extra ram and maybe even putting a ssd sata 3 in it.  For less than $50 I upgraded the RAM to 8gb and saw a substantial jump in the windows ratings.This is the ram kit bought.  However, this kit gives you 2 4gb sticks of identical ram to what it came with. Same samsung serial number and everything.  You really only need 1, so if you can find one... go for it.Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2KIT51264BC1339)Windows Experience Index with stock 4GB:Processor: 5.3Memory (RAM): 5.9Graphics: 4.5Gaming Graphics: 6.1Primary Hard Disk: 5.9Windows Experience Index with 8GB kit Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2), 204-pin SODIMM, DDR3 PC3-10600 Memory Module (CT2KIT51264BC1339):Processor: 5.3Memory (RAM): 7.2Graphics: 5.9Gaming Graphics: 6.5Primary Hard Disk: 5.9", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great everyday use computer!!!!!", "Author": "Happy stinky fish", "ReviewID": "R1F9ICT15OCAUE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This machine has 4gb memory and a relatively powerful cpu.
