{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gaming and stuff", "Author": "D. Bryson \"Dru_vid\"", "ReviewID": "R153ZDMK474IBE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this as a mid level gaming laptop to replace an old Acer 1.8 Ghz celeron running XP that is on its last leg. I can not compare the two, this is my first HP and second laptop. I am VERY happy with the performance increase in every way. The glossy charcoal grey and case look cool and all the LED's are a bright white, a bit starry looking. I have been using my new HP daily for almost three months, mostly on AC power, with gaming, movies and basic internet stuff. I've installed eight games (Legend of Grimrock, Trine 2, Civ 5, Mount & Blade collection, Metro 2033, Clones, Zen Bound 2 and Darksiders) and played many demos through Steam. All my games work fine, no problems. Not all work well on the highest graphical settings, though look cool when game settings are tuned. I searched a few websites and the statistics for this computer claim it will play \"almost any\" game on the market now. If it can't play a Windows 7 compatible game on high settings, it will play it on lower settings for sure. The HD 1600x900 screen is bright and crisp. The speakers are loud and clear. The keyboard is quiet and responsive. I like the style and shape of the keys. Boot time to the desktop is just over a minute, after I removed a few unnecessary background programs. Other than that I have not modified anything. It was easy to set up and understand. HP has some nice assistant software included also.A few cons, but minor: The power plug is on the right side and I like to use a mouse so I must arrange the wire out of my way. The mouse pad buttons are designed strange and blend with the laptop case surrounding them, which makes the buttons somewhat difficult to find by touch in low light. The glossy case attracts finger prints easily but the grey hides them a bit. And, the case access door on the under side is a bit sticky and needs a little extra love to get it open.I have been really enjoying this laptop and would definitely consider another HP. Also I will max out the memory to 8 GB soon, that might help with some game settings.Damien", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice laptop, nice price", "Author": "oldbaritone", "ReviewID": "R3FEARTZUY9XL5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "a good high-performance laptop, now available at a very competitive price from several sources. Quad-core runs applications very fast, so even compute-intensive tasks like 3D rendering are livable.

It's an improvement in every way, over a computer I was very happy with.It's screaming fast, with a dedicated graphics card, so streaming is not a problem.  6 gigs of ram, and the quad core i5 processor allows running 4-5-6 programs without slowing it down.  The giant screen is bright, very colorful, and easy on the eyes, and of course it has Windows 7, not the piece of c rap Windows 8.The sound is average, like most laptops.  Battery life is about 4 hours, which is excepional for such a big screen, and powerful cpu.Connecting to the web was a one step process, and configuring in Control Panel was as easy as it gets.The web cam works perfectly, and is improved over the last model, and the keyboard is spaced more efficiently, with buttons easier to press.If you're looking for a mid-high end computer, for not much money, this one is hard to beat.  I even bought another one for my wife, and she loves hers as well.The only thing I don't like very much is the two finger scroll.  My pad isn't as sensitive as hers, and can be a little frustrating, but with all the advantages of speed, and ability to edit music, and even videos easily, it's a very small concern.I would recommend this computer to anyone!Happy shopping!", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "annoying problems", "Author": "chevygirl", "ReviewID": "R3QX9XQLMPM5UU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "i bought this computer last june (2012) and within 6 months the internet would not connect anywhere I went. the battery doesn't last more than 2 1/2 hours and the out side scratches and dents easily.otherwise very happy with the rest of the performance!", "Date": "June 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Pleased.", "Author": "Sharon A.", "ReviewID": "RY5RT812E6I9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I received this laptop as a gift. I have had it a short while, and am extremely pleased with it. it came with 4 gb. memory which was sufficient, but I maxed it out with 8gb. memory. It is everything I wanted in a laptop.

She loved it, till someone broke in and stole all her electronics.  It was especially hard to lose the laptop, with all the family research and photos.

It was given a low rating at that time, the rating was removed because it stopped him from selling to Amazon.It was tampered with as we can tell now and I am not pleased with it at all.

Was a bit surprised when I got it because the packaging wasn't glamarous and I basically got the laptop and the power adaptor alone. But that's ok. It works great, Looks great. Much better than what I had before.Update - After a couple of months I have changed this rating to 5 stars because this laptop is wonderful. Talk about a good buy! Works like a charm. I'm going to reward this laptop with another 4GB of memory soon.", "Date": "February 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "View tips and guidelines | 19 more words required", "Author": "Joseph M.
