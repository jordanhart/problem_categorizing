{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Ultrabook for the price", "Author": "Brian", "ReviewID": "R3H793LYQ8BHYA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Best priced 128GB SSD ultrabook I could find with these specs. I did not want to pay extra for a touch screen because if the touch pad works fine, why put fingerprints and smudges all over the screen? It has the look and feel of a MacBook Air except the keys are not backlit. I installed Start8 to give it a Windows 7 UI (and bring back the start button). The Windows Metro UI is best suited for touch screen tablets. Boot up is smoking fast and overall everything works great. It comes with a HDMI to VGA adapter. My only major complaint is the usual bloatware that comes installed but I used Revo uninstaller to get rid of it. They should have a feature that separates the freebie programs from those that are necessary for hardware operation.", "Date": "April 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "5 Stars.

Quick start up, small and light.  But I've only had the thing a couple weeks, and it looks as though the hard drive has gone kaput.  When I try to start it, it says \"no bootable device - please restart system\".  I have tried restarting mulitple times, same thing.  I'm not a heavy user, no gaming or anything.  Just e-mail, facebook, some web surfing and the like.  So now I'm back on my super-slow dinosaur (yet still mostly functioning) Dell laptop, and the Acer support page won't load, so I can't find who to contact.  No longer impressed.  In fact, rather frustrated.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Handy ultrabook", "Author": "barriosb5", "ReviewID": "R2REGTCN22LTUP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This ultrabook came in handy. I can carry it everywhere.  It's light and fast to connect to WiFi anywhere I go. Screen is clear and vivid.

I wanted one just for lite browsing, printing shipping labels and putting up store items. The main thing I wanted was decent speed and for it to boot and \"wake up\" fast. I am tired of waiting on my Alienware to boot for 3 minutes every time I want to use it. This has been perfect. The Solid State Drive makes everything faster. This is a nice thin light laptop and it does everything I want. It comes on when I open the lid and it only takes a few seconds. It never bogs down or gets slow. I could do without Windows 8 but even that is not a problem. I have it set up just like A Windows 7 PC. I paid in the mid $300's and I see the price has risen. I think it is worth it even for a little more but not too much. For the price I got I think it is a steal.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing little device!", "Author": "BikeBooster", "ReviewID": "RRBA8C85YQ30Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Very lightGreat performance for size and priceVery fast bootclear crisp displayKeyboard very similar to mac counterpartusb 3.0128GB SSD!!Cons:Battery life about 6hrs (I would sacrifice some size and weight for a bigger battery)Mouse pad (I prefer having individual right and left mouse buttons, multitouch works great though)could use 2 more usb portsI purchased this to replace my 17\" gamin laptop.

This is not a problem if your hard disc is big, but it is a problem if the hard disc is small like this computer.

This computer looks great; it's light; it's thin; it's easy to travel with. It's pretty much the only ultrabook you can get at this price point, so that alone is a big plus. Portability is essential for me, and this computer meets the test. Also, as advertised, it resumes from hibernation incredibly quickly. In general, it's noticeably faster and has better video than my old Aspire A5 from 2010. Also, I loved that computer for it's 13-inch screen, but that size is becoming harder to find.The downsides: the battery time is pretty low. You can really only use it for 2.5 or 3 hours without plugging it in, which is far lower than many other ultrabooks. I'm willing to sacrifice a couple of hours of battery capacity to get a computer that's hundreds of dollars cheaper, though.The bigger issue is the wireless adapter, which basically doesn't work without a driver update -- a major problem since there's no Ethernet port. Fortunately, I was able to install the latest driver for the wireless card on another computer and install it off of a flash drive, and that mostly fixed the problem. I still have more Internet connectivity issues than I would like, but most of the time the Internet works fine with the updated driver.Finally, Windows 8 is a frustrating OS for those used to Windows 7, but it's not too hard to basically ignore the annoying Windows 8 interface and use the computer normally.Overall, the computer is definitely recommended for the price, but some frustrations are likely inevitable.", "Date": "August 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Dan the Man", "ReviewID": "RHA2DSVOAG1I4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this laptop at a great price, and it has served my wife well.
