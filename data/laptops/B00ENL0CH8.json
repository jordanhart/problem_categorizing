{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid choice for a laptop.", "Author": "Caleb V.", "ReviewID": "RHALYV2GOZJIY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop honestly had everything I was looking for. (Except for windows 8.. not a huge fan)The screen looks great! From playing games with high settings to watching HD movies, everything has looked very good to say the least. The colors look great!The Audio is pretty decent as well. Speakers are pretty decent not to mention it has a built in subwoofer. Everything seemed pretty clear as far as the vocals go.They Keyboard is done by SteelSeries and is pretty comfortable to type on. The keys are also illuminated and have a program which is very customizable for the LED settings.The touchpad takes some getting used to but once customized its decent. Honestly though if I'm gaming or doing some long work then I'm usually using a mouse. The left and right click are hidden under the bottom of the touchpad making it look pretty sleek.The graphics card is pretty decent too. I've been able to LoL, WoW, and FFXIV:ARR with pretty high settings and have good FPS.The heat dissipation was very well thought through for this laptop in my opinion. It pulls air from the top and expels it from each of the sides at a 45 degree angle upward. This makes sure that the heat doesn't make your legs into toast and ensures that the heat doesn't get trapped under the laptop.I havent had a chance to use the webcam yet.Battery life is pretty decent and has a feature that allows the user to toggle between integrated and dedicated graphics in order to optimize battery life.I love the 16 gigs of ram and the SSD(s) that make this laptop pretty quick. I really loved the how I was able to get so many features along with a slim laptop. It also looks very sleek and classy.I would recommend this laptop. In hindsight, if I had it to do over, I would have gotten the version that had 2 SSD(s) instead of only one. (FYI the only difference between the two is storage space and an additional SSD)", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "A sexy piece of art and power", "Author": "Trinh Le", "ReviewID": "R1J35KTNIQMD9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If this laptop were human (male or female), I bet everyone (if not everyone than lots of people) would fall for it. It is very slim, powerful, big (I mean the screen), and extremely portable ( easy to take it, him, her wherever you go).*I will try not to talk to much about the power this machine offers, I think everyone can read that part under the description***I did not buy this through Amazon, since with the tax, it was much more expensive to ship to Virginia (what a shame, it is very cheap on Amazon too - The original price without tax).*****Grammar mistakes throughout the entire review - Do keep that in mind***I have had this laptop for over 2 weeks and I completely love it. Some things that people have said was a flaw with this laptop that I have not witnessed yet.Issues reported, but not found (Keep in mind that some product may be defective):1) Apparently the mousepad is not sensitive, which I found to be untrue (in my case). The mousepad, on its default setting, is quite slow, so I turned it up a little bit more, but it reads movement accurately. Also, when I'm at home and not in class, I tend to use a usb mouse (recommended).2) Issues with keyboard (space bar, steelseries, etc). Luckily, I have found no issues with the Space bar not functioning when pressing it on the left side or the shift key not responding. As of 2weeks+, no issues whatsoever with the keyboard. The lighting on the steelseries keyboard took a little getting use to since I didn't know how to set it up, I wish there were more options like they have it on the alienware, but the coolest thing has got to be the audio function. It flashes along with the beat of the music that you are listening to.3) Heat. This is such a big issue for some people since this laptop is so small, lots of heat will be trapped and cause the temperature to go extremely high. I had IC Diamond 7 placed on the CPU / GPU before testing the heat (sorry no control in this experiment), but I have played some high demanding games such as Skyrim, Battlefield, Total Wars (Shogun 2, Rome 2), and many more on max graphics, and max temperature was roughly around 70-78 Celsius. (I'm not sure if you guys want it that high or not), but compared to my old laptop (Alienware M14x), playing a game on low-medium graphics would toss the temperature up to around 90-100. (Tested with RealTemp program).4) Fan Noise (This goes with the heat). Yes the fan does make a noise, both of them actually. The noise level I can say is not that high whatsoever. When hitting the 78 degrees Celsius, I thought the fan was running on low when dispelling the heat so I got worried, but apparently the fan was going pretty quickly to draw out the heat. So yes there is noise, but not extremely noticeable. If you have an alienware (Sorry that this is my only comparable product, but it was my last one and haven't used any other for comparison), you would know that alienware's fan are extremely loud. The GS70's fan is about 1/3 of the noise of the alienware on max.Those are the only things that I have in mind right now to clarify about issues presented by other owners of the GS70, if you have anymore questions, don't be afraid to ask in the comments or something.Now to move on to the Pros/Cons/ and Thoughts on it.Pros:-Have you seen how slim this thing is? I mean look at it, probably no thicker than the size of a nickel. (haven't measured, but I'm taking a guess and too lazy to get out of bed while writing this review to measure it - sorry).-Big screen (If you already have a 17.3 or external monitor with bigger screen size, do ignore this)-Killer Doubleshot = Extremely good (low) latency on wifi or ethernet (well ethernet is a given), but over wifi, it is really good. (Take my word for this - Tested between the alienware and this and lets say that there is a 40ms difference).-USB 3.0 (4 of them). Well USB 3.0 should be a given with laptops nowadays, but if you have an old outdated laptop, USB 3.0 is a big leap (of faith - Assassin's Creed). Much faster transfer speed and everything.-Steelseries keyboard - If you have never had a laptop with colorful keyboard, then you are in for a big treat.-Dual fan (on top) - I like that the fan doesn't go on the bottom since I feel like a lot of things can block it, and the GS70's air intake is on the top and it gets pushed on the sides at an angle so you don't come in contact with the heat if you were to use a mouse or something (Very very clever).-765M Graphics Card (Pro in my case) - Well there are a lot better ones out there, but this will take care of most of your needs and gaming nowadays and a major upgrade if you have an old laptop.-External display up to 3840 x 2160 - I mean that is freaken awesome. If you have an external display for that resolution, why not?-Less expensive than other gaming laptops with the same portability.-Did I mention how slim it is?Cons:-Dual fan (on top) - This can also be a con since those cooling fans for laptops will not help much since there will be no intake of air from the bottom. BUT (could be a solution), I got ThermaPAK Laptop Cooling Heatshift Pad, which helps cooling the laptop down a bit (I do not recommend for extremely long time since once the pad gets hot, it won't do much good, but it does help. Also one thing about the pad, it does reduce a good amount of temperature from the laptop through the (well you can read this on the description of the product.-Charging Port - Even though this laptop is very sexy in almost every way, shape, and form, I just cannot let this go. The charging port is right on the side of the laptop (next to the expelling heat area). This may not be a CON to some people, but I prefer having it on the back of a laptop. Much more convenient, for me at least.-Upgrade-ability - Graphics card cannot be upgraded and some other things too unless you want to void warranty (Take this with a grain of salt)The so-so:-Windows 8 / 8.1..... To be honest, I like it. I despised Windows 8 when it first came out, since it was such a big change from what I was use to for so many years (Change is hard - and not favorable sometimes), but i decided to suck it up and take it like a man. After a day or so of messing around with it, I found out that Windows 8 isn't as terrible as I thought it would be (sure it would work better with touchscreen, but I don't want smudges  all over this sexy beast). Luckily I saw that Windows 8.1 is a free upgrade if your laptop has Windows 8 (Thank God the GS70 does). I upgraded and found the Windows (Start) button in the bottom left corner. - Not to get on a tangent about Windows 8, but gaming experience hasn't changed much at all, and I am use to the interface now - Not saying that everything is perfect, but passable.Thoughts?I do highly recommend this product. Also, I do apologize for a long review, but I wanted to put some thought into writing this review, I mean look at how expensive this thing is. Don't you want to be sure what you are paying for? Besides that, this laptop is amazing for gaming, and extremely portable which is not something you would think of for a laptop. Also! It is much cheaper and, I dare say, better (much or not I do not know since I don't own the razerblade) than the razerblade. If you happen to be a die-hard Windows 7 person, you can always switch back (at a cost of course), but I do recommend giving Windows 8 a try and see what it is like (a couple days, not a few minutes and making up your mind).

This is significantly lighter than my four-year-old 15-inch Vaio.My initial attempt to use Windows Server 2012 R2 on it turned out to be unnecessary. The WS2012R2 driver for the Qualcomm Atheros bluetooth didn't work after the install + update, and the Qualcomm Killer Suite for Windows 8/8.1 didn't install properly and kept displaying a pop-up message about missing BTHPROPS.CPL. This also made the wireless not work.It didn't matter in the end because, with Windows 8.1 Enterprise, I got everything I had planned to get (I don't care about the Start button), including Hyper-V, BitLocker and Windows Defender, with no problems with either the bluetooth or the wireless.Also, I did want the sleep/hibernate option after all, which wasn't available with the Server edition.Another thing I like is being able to mount ISO images from Windows Explorer (it is about time), so I don't need an optical drive.I wouldn't have guessed, but the four USB ports are proving to be quite useful as well.I had placed an order for the GT60 version that weighs well over 7 pounds but was fortunate to find this model at the last minute and cancel the order.In short, it is quite awesome at the moment. I am even liking Windows 8.1.If things continue to be this smooth for the next six months, I will come back and add another star.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "More than meets the eye.", "Author": "James Wilson", "ReviewID": "RQMXAT39SV8MZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pro: Thin, the lightest 17\" gaming laptop I've every used. Faster than I expected. Air flow is nicely designed. The screen quality is a lot better than I expected with sharp colors, and more than enough brightness. Hasewell processor handles X-plane 10 better than my old desktop I use to have with a i7 960 and a gtx 560.Cons: I really don't have any. After all its not called a PC for nothing. Personal (preference) Computer.One thing to mention is this laptop does have a metal chase so the base can get warm but the chase is really acting like on be heat sink adding to the heat dissipation. So if that may be of concern that's why laptop cooler pad are mad for. The other thing to mention is since the air intake in mainly and the top of the laptop when its cold out never site underneath the air vent when the heat comes on while gaming........... yea heat against heat is cKaaaboooomm.......lol not really but my laptop was very hot and it still was running ok but I didn't want to risk finding out how hot it can run before it crashed and died. Still this laptop is the best to go with if you want something on the go with awesome screen real estate and graphics power. Now if you have to have all the latest games with maxed out settings then you shouldn't be buying a laptop at all.

Dope indeed.  I've never had a laptop with an SSD, so I love the instant-on/off capabilities.  Screw window's loading screen!  Now, I rarely see it.

I always go for something 4.5lbs or less.  Usually I'm merely content with my laptops, sacrificing speed for weight.  This time has been much different.  Civilizations V loads blazingly fast, War Thunder flown in cinematic quality, LoL turned up, Dragon Age 2 super bloody,  It all looks good and loads faster than ever.  I've heard complaints about heat, and yes this one gets a bit warm on the underside, but so far my machine has loaded faster and ran cooler than any laptop I've ever owned....and as a accident-prone traveling businessman/gamer, I've gone through a lot of em.
