{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works fine so far!", "Author": "kellyzdude", "ReviewID": "R1WTQ7J43M3530", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop after a few months of longing, a few weeks of research, and a few days of price hunting. My requirements were fairly simple. I wanted Windows 7 with an i3 or better, at least 4GB of RAM (upgrade-able to 8) and a 320GB drive or bigger. I also wanted to spend no more than $500.The system arrived within a few days and I excitedly opened it and read through the instructions (this is out of character, but I understand the importance of first start up). The first step was running the backup (4 DVDs later..) and then I worked on removing the bloat. ASUS, like so many others, ships with a bunch of crap you don't need, though in this case it was less than I expected.The system itself is nice and quick. I have had it playing Need For Speed Hot Pursuit (the new one) and it performs nicely. I've also had it running a Folding@Home client (see [...]) which nets around 2000 points per day. This compares to about 200-300 on my old Athlon64 Desktop machine.Other notes:- The power socket is on the left hand side about halfway between the front and the back, and the connector itself is a right-angle. This is a weird place, but is convenient. My wife's most recent Dell had a side connector and it was still damaged through leaning it on things it shouldn't be. I feel the design and location on this laptop would prevent a lot of those issues.- The laptop feels very cool, even while pumping out very hot air through the vent. It's warm on the legs, but by no means hot like I've experienced with older laptops.- The numeric keypad is nice, but is a little weird if you're used to the separated keypad on larger laptops or desktop keyboards. More than once I've hit the right-arrow while trying to tap zero. It can feel very crowded in that area also, with the keys from the left arrow all the way over to the ./delete key being the same size (along with those around them) so it can be difficult to place fingers without looking.- HDMI works and carries sound with it. I had it hooked in to a 55\" LCD TV a few days ago playing Need for Speed quite nicely. I didn't think to check what resolution it was at (I suspect the native resolution of the laptop's panel as it was mirroring), but it looked really nice. Others may be more picky about this than I..All things considered this seems to be a fine machine, especially for the price, and I expect it to last for quite some time into the future.", "Date": "April 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent general purpose laptop...", "Author": "35-year Technology Consumer \"8-tracks to 802.11\"", "ReviewID": "R6EIACLG93MLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ASUS A53-AS31-RD is a very good general purpose laptop. It works well with productivity applications, web browsing and basic photo editing. It multitasks well (playing music and working on Office applications). The area around the keyboard and touchpad and the top are each textured; that and the dark red color keep this machine from being a fingerprint magnet: good design!Ports include an SD media slot, a LAN connection, three USB ports and HDMI out. Battery life is average; around 3 hours out of the box, although you can probably coax more out of it with adjustments in the Windows 7 control panel or the included ASUS desktop power management gadget. Out of the box it was relatively free of unwanted bloatware or trial versions of programs (kudos to ASUS for that).This computer does not ship with recovery media; you'll need four DVDs when you run its built-in utility to create your own recovery kit (do this first!).Overall, this is a solid laptop that should serve well for all but the most demanding computing needs. The color breaks it from the packs of black, silver and white machines out there! Watch for deep discounts to make this unit even more attractive.Note: this machine's default hard drive configuration includes two logical partitions, with about 75% devoted to a \"D\" drive for data. I used Windows disk management tools to shrink that volume and restore all the free space to the \"C\" drive. This is just my preference, but it can help avoid issues with applications that struggle to remember \"non-C-drive\" locations for storing data files.", "Date": "April 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "i5 Review", "Author": "E. Brown \"EB\"", "ReviewID": "R1DACQXM4R39EL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item comes in i3 & i5 versions. The i5 isn't always available, though.This A53e might be reasonably priced for what you get, but it's not quite what I think of as a 'budget' device.A budget laptop has an i3 processor. I'm reviewing the i5.A budget laptop has around 250-500gb memory.  This has 750gbA budget laptop doesn't have HD screen. This doesA budget laptop doesn't usually come w/HDMI or USB 3.0. This doesA budget laptop doesn't usually come w/face detection. This doesThat said, the 4gb of onboard RAM is definitely budget, but also upgradeable to 8gb for only $23. The 0.3 megapixel webcam is also pretty low-rent. So, it's obviously not the top-shelf model either.The i5 processor is the 2nd gen variant which is a significant step-up from the 1st i5, plus it has 'turbo boost' which variably kicks in. So, it's not a mid-range i5. It's closer to an i7 than an i3.This is the coolest-running PC I've owned. The white version has a subtle design to it. I was happy to find little bloatware.CONSThe description is inaccurate. This is an LCD laptop, not an LED. There is no onboard bluetooth. There is no dial volume control. Instead, you must click on-screen volume control & slide or use the function & f12 keys repeatedly which is less than convenient. You can't just lower the sound immediately. That *really* bothers me. Something to consider if you sneak peaks at porn in heavy rotation. The same applies to the brightness adjustments - 2 clicks & it doesn't always respond. The mouse clicker is too loud which seems kind of cheap. The speaker could be a bit louder. The webcam is below par. The screen started out bright, but seems to have gotten dimmer, even with brightness adjustment all the way up.CONCLUSIONAs with most things, I have a few gripes. Why 5 stars? A 15.6 inch, HD, 750gb, 2nd gen i5 w/turbo, stylized, dependable notebook, that comes with this type of warranty is hard to find, particularly at $560. You could pay twice as much for a Macbook that would be smaller, slower and less dependable (according to Gizmodo's 'Laptop Reliability Study'). The A53e is a steal. It has the looks and many of the specs of a more expensive model.EXTRASFor $23, I purchased an additional 4gb of RAM (for a total of 8gb). The 4gigs works okay, but if you're apt to have 4 or 5 programs running at once or you're into video editing, you might want to bump it up. Even if you don't work your laptop so much, adding the extra 4gb is an easy, affordable way to future-proof your computer. Get it outta the way now. Kingston ValueRam 4GB PC3-10600 L9 204-Pin SODIMM Notebook Memory KVR1333D3S9/4G is compatible & fits perfectly. (See my review there) If you're not a techie, you needn't worry about ruining your laptop. Asus makes it very easy to understand by providing a second empty slot to add 4gb. All you need is a small Philips screwdriver & 5 minutes tops. There are brief, simple tutorials on YouTube as well. Adding RAM is the most affordable way to give some extra speed and extend your computer's relevant life. If you're strapped for cash, the 4gigs will serve you fine for a while.A word about Windows 7. You can no longer click-drag to re-order files in a folder. You can only rename them alphabetically or numerically. I downloaded IrfanView to work around this. If you want MS Office, but wish to keep your costs under $600, download Open Office at openoffice.org. It's free and offers all the functionality.This computer doesn't come with recovery disks, so you will need 5 dvd-r disks and an hour & fifteen minutes of your time to create them. The laptop will remind you to create them every time you turn the device on.I made out like a bandit. I can't believe I nabbed a reputable Asus with 750gb, 2nd gen i5, 8gigs of RAM and 15.6 screen for under $600. Go ahead, shop around. You'll end up right back here for this steal. For the record, Asus & Toshiba make the most dependable laptops. HP, some of the worst.Got any questions?

The aluminum trim around the keyboard is a nice finish. It does keep the palm cool. I like that the track pad is closer to the middle so your palm is not accidentally touching it. Laptop is really quiet even under demanding application. Can barely hear a whisper from the fan. Hard Drive noise is very low also. You can hear a hint of it. No vibrations.

It had to have some decent specs at a low price and this one fit the bill nicely.  I bought the i3 version.I don't understand why all these people have trouble with ASUS quality.  I own several ASUS products now including motherboards for some home build desktops and I've never had a single problem with any of them.  This laptop is no exception.  At least for me....so far.There are only a couple things I could gripe about this laptop.  One is they should have added a second 4GB RAM stick for a total of 8.  And the HDD could be at least a 7200RPM drive.  Generally the higher RPM, the quicker the drive.  The worst bottleneck for any system is the data transfer rate from the HDD.  I installed a Corsair SSD in my desktop and everything loads in seconds, including windows boot time.  I guess you can't expect more RAM and an SSD in a notbook PC for under 500 bucks though (if only a Zenbook were under 500 bucks).  You might want a pair of headphones too for when you want to watch a DVD or listen to some music.I spent the extra 20 bucks on a RAM stick, 20 bucks on a Logitech wireless mouse (I hate touchpads), and 20 bucks on a case.Kingston ValueRam 4GB PC3-10600 L9 204-Pin SODIMM Notebook Memory KVR1333D3S9/4GLogitech M305 Wireless Mouse (Silver)Case Logic VNA-216 16-Inch Laptop Attache (Black)After I installed the second 4GB RAM stick, Windows Experience Index (for those who are curious) for the RAM jumped from 5.9 to 7.3.  Like E.Brown stated in his review, the process for adding the RAM takes 5 minutes tops.  Short tutorials can be found on youtube.ASUS's included Power4Gear Hybrid power management software is nice for conserving the battery.  I got the battery to last just shy of 6 hours while I was writing a paper and surfing the web.  It does slow down the speed of the internet in battery save mode though.  But not horribly bad.  Speaking of included software,  There isn't much preloaded software at all (a new smartphone has about 10 times more).  Anything you don't want or need you can just uninstall it.This thing is silent.  I can't even hear the HDD spin at all.  The optical drive is pretty loud but that's normal.  Overall this is a great budget, all-a-round, general purpose notebook.Oh one more thing.  Make sure you have six blank DVD-R disks.  The package doesn't contain a factory recovery disk so you are prompted to create your own.  The process took an hour and 45 minutes but you'll be happy you spent the time if you ever have a critical system error.I'll update this review if any issues arise but so far I couldn't be happier with my purchase.::EDIT::7/1/2012::I just notice one more thing that is a minor bummer:  There is no eSATA port for hooking up an external HDD.  Personally, I like to almost exclusively use eSATA for quicker and safer data transfer but USB 3.0 is pretty fast so it's not a big deal at all!", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "A wise investment.", "Author": "Snappy J", "ReviewID": "R1ZYAXTH9J1KSH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As I type this review, I am using the computer. I've had it for a whole week now, and so far it has been working just fine as far as the hardware. I haven't went a single day without using it since I got it, so I would say I have had a fair amount of time to judge it. When I was looking for a new computer, I saw that this particular model had very good reviews, although there weren't a whole lot of reviews at the time. I watched as the number of reviews grew, and the overall rating was staying in the 5 1/2 star range. The previous Netbook that I owned was also a model from Asus, so I had a decent idea of the company which I was dealing with, and I expected fairly good quality for a lesser price. After waiting a week for Amazon to ship the computer, and then a few more days for it to arrive, I put it to use immediately.Now, obviously some people wouldn't agree with me when I say that I find the top of the black model to be very attractive. It has this glossy look, and although it may collect a moderate amount of smudges, in my opinion, it really makes the casing look nice. Also the little graphic pattern that covers the top, I also find it easy on the eyes. I know some reviewers complained about the design, but I like it, and truthfully the pictures on Amazon don't really do it justice.The keyboard is surrounded by an aluminum coating. This keeps the casing from getting scratched easily, but it also makes the palm rests feel very cool before you start using it. Thanks to \"Ice Cool\" technology, after prolonged use, the palm rests still stays below body temperature. Also, the keyboard, I like it as well! The keys are perfectly spaced out for me, and they're easy to push in, and provide a very satisfying sound. My only complain with the keyboard is that at times I don't hit the space bar as hard as I need to, and just because of how it's made, it occasionally doesn't register. It's just something that I'm going to have to get used to.The touch pad is roomy, and sensitive. The finger gesture commands work well- a little too well. I turned them off because it would register things that I didn't intend for it to. As for the buttons, they were no more than I expected based on my last Asus computer. They're loud, and the plastic used feels likely to eventually wear down and basically appear as if it is corroded due to moisture in a fingertip. However, I am one who typically clicks by tapping the touch pad rather than pushing a button, so these issues do not bother me as much.The speakers, they're decent. As others have already said, they could be louder, but it's not really the volume that's the issue, it's the fact that they sound a bit muffled. Granted, Asus provides a program called \"Sonic Focus\" on the computer that helps improve the sound. I will say that the speakers were and upgrade from my netbook, so I'm satisfied, yet still not impressed.On the day I received the computer, I was freaking out because at one point, I couldn't hear a thing. I thought my speakers were messed up and that I would have to send my computer back. Then, I discovered that it was not a hardware issue. I believe the problem lies within Windows 7, because even with headphones I was getting no sound output at all. After a few updates and a couple of restarts, I haven't had any problems with it anymore, but I assume that it was not because of this particular model of computer that it happened in the first place. I also found that there is a mode setting on the computer that you can change to called \"Quiet Office\" and as long as your computer is in this mode, it cancels all sound output. Other modes include \"Battery Saving\", \"Entertainment\", and \"High Performance\". Each of these modes do make a difference on how the computer performs. On battery saving mode with the brightness of my monitor on the second highest level, I get an average of about 4 hours of constant use.When I transferred my files from my old computer to this one, all I had available to use was an 8 gig flash drive. I had around 40 gigs to transfer, and I was convinced that It was going to take forever. This computer has 3 USB ports, but one of them is a version 3.0 USB port, which is approximately ten times faster than your standard 2.0 USB that most computers have. Basically, data that was taking about 25 to 30 minutes to copy to my flash drive on my old computer and were being pasted to my new computer in about 3 to 5 minutes, because I was able to use the 3.0 USB port located on the left side of the device.Video quality is very nice, and on the 15.6 monitor, HD videos show up beautifully. I can thoroughly enjoy all of my videos, and the large screen gives me plenty of space to organize my desktop and windows. I am able to play some games flawlessly on this computer; games like Trackmania or Alien Swarm on Steam (for those of you who know what I'm talking about) run perfectly fine. Even so, I don't use my computer to play a lot of games.The performance of this computer is as expected, and I'm not saying that is a bad thing. It runs very well, and it's probably the quickest computer I've ever used, considering that we don't usually hold the latest technology in my house. I haven't had it freeze up on me yet, and I can run many programs at a time. The computer is able to connect to my internet very quickly. When I put it in standby, I can always start right back up where I left off, even in the middle of a Youtube video. I want to buy extra ram for it, and upgrade to 8 gigs, that's a fairly inexpensive way to make it even faster.Overall, I think this computer is well worth the price! People make me nervous when they talk about how theirs messed up after a couple of weeks, however I have not noticed anything in particular that seems to be working incorrectly so far, and I hope that this device will give me a few years of good use like I feel like it will. I fully recommend this computer, and I know that if this one is does get messed up, I would only settle with another one of the same model. I like it that much!If you have any questions, I'll try to answer them, just leave a comment.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "key feature missing", "Author": "amym", "ReviewID": "R2806WZCJ6WHFJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this laptop based on the positive reviews on amazon as well as an associate's regular business purchases of a different Asus laptop model.  While the machine works well, the problem is that the optical device driver won't write to any disc-dvd or cd.  I found this out by trying to make the recovery discs. Asus online support had me try several different fixes including downloading a new chipset and updating the bios.  Unfortunately, nothing worked.  The link to the bios update had me trying to update with an older version of bios-error message came up \"build date too old\" when I tried use the update.  For some reason support would not listen to me telling them that it was a problem with the device, they kept focusing on the AI Recovery program that you use to create the recovery discs.  They had me update that program but that link ended up downloading a blu ray version that wasn't on my laptop to begin with.  When online support ran out of answers, they told me to call the US service center.  A half hour on hold and they wanted me to do a complete recovery of the operating system which means that I lose everything I have created since I got the laptop 4 weeks ago.  This makes me not happy.  Once I finally convinced them that the problem was with the ODD and not the recovery program, their only solution is to send the laptop back to them. Not happy again. I am guessing this not only means losing the use of the laptop for weeks but I imagine all my stuff will not be kept private or they will do the recovery and I lose everything anyway.

The external power plug-in socket is located on the left side about 4.5 inches from the front; and the cable from the internet router plugs in about 3.5 inches from the front.On my previous laptop, all these sockets were either on the back of the machine, or on the sides near the back.  Consequently with my previous laptop there was no clutter of cords and wires to printer, external hard-drive, mouse, etc.WHAT THIS MEANS TO YOU is that with this computer you will have a spaghetti-bowl of wires extending outwards for 4 inches or so on both sides of the computer, all the way down to the front edge.  This means that you cannot lay books or papers or writing materials closer than maybe 5-6 inches to the sides of the computer.

On the other hand, for people who are constantly using their laptop in a \"portable\" mode, this setup makes it more convenient to detach the computer for transport off-site.So whether this is a blessing or a curse depends on how you use the computer.Also, another reviewer talked about upgrading this computer's memory from 4gb to 8gb by purchasing an additional memory board here on Amazon (about $23) and inserting it yourself.  I did it and it was quite easy.  However, if I had it to do over again, I would purchase the additional memory from Crucial since they offer the same thing for the same price (also shipped free)--plus their website has a foolproof match-up calculator to make sure you're getting the right thing.  Also their website has a very useful discussion (with pictures) on exactly how to mount the new memory board.The memory board purchased from Amazon came in an envelope directly from Taiwan (sorta like an Ebay deal) with no assurance that it would work in my machine; and I did feel that twinge of doubt, like I was taking a gamble and this wasn't a real smart move.  As it turned out, no problem.NOTE: When you go to mount the board, after you have detached the power cord and removed the battery and flipped the computer upside-down, you will see two different panels which can be removed.  You want to remove the SMALLER of the two panels.  Remove the two small Phillips-head screws which you can see.  Remove the screws completely; and then you can slide the panel toward the front of the machine and lift it off.  If it sticks and doesn't want to slide, just jiggle it a little until you can insert a fingernail between the panel you loosened and the other panel (that you didn't loosen).  Then you will see the empty socket, just waiting for the new board!  Enjoy!Other trivia--The red (actually a rich maroon, with a kind of a carbon-fiber pattern) case is frankly outstandingly beautiful, and I don't usually pay attention to stuff like that, so trust me it's very nice.  Also the \"delete\" key (which I use a LOT) is buried anonymously among a hundred other keys--NOT easy to find, except that I noticed it is directly above the right edge of the backspace key, which is large and conspicuous.Also--I am a Linux Ubuntu user, and the Ubuntu operating system loaded onto this machine seamlessly, and all the drivers for externals seem to work fine.  I hated to pay for Windows7 which I won't even use, but the price of this machine WITH useless (to me) Windows7 is still significantly less expensive than a comparable dedicated Ubuntu machine.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hardly any complaints", "Author": "NichelleJ", "ReviewID": "R2SUIB0TCH74NP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this laptop less than a week ago so it's fairly new; I'm just formulating a review based off what I've experienced so far and what other customer complaints were.First things first: It's NOT 750 GBI don't know maybe it's just my laptop but when I got it about 32 GB had already been used for pre-installed programs.

Battery life isn't the greatestIt also never overheats and doesn't make loud awkward noisesLast thing I'm going to talk about: GamingSo anyone who has ever gamed before knows that Intel graphics and gaming is one of the worst possible combinations ever but since this laptop has so much ram and a 2.3 Ghz processor it can pass most gaming compatibility testIf it fails the compatibility test it's always because of the Intel graphics but everything else will pass the testI game sometimes I only put one game on here though that's the sims 3 and about six expansion packs because this laptop is for school not gamingIf you're looking for a laptop just for gaming look elsewhere, don't even look at laptops at all if you want hardcore gaming unless you have 1-3 thousand dollars to wasteIf you have the name of a game in your head I'd be more than willing to run a compatibility test for you, I might even go as far as playing the game if its one I already own", "Date": "July 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asus laptop 15 inch monitor", "Author": "Roz", "ReviewID": "R280KPOZM2XEFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used the Asus laptop for a month, and find it to be very responsive, and clearity is extremely good.

I routinely have six or more programs open at once and the laptop stays surprisingly cool while there is no slowdown at all, without having upgraded from the standard 4 GB RAM. An extremely quality purchase for the price that should meet most users' needs with ease.Cons: The Intel Video Card leaves something to be desired for gamers and reaches its maximum potential on graphically heavy games from early 2011, however, if you're planning on gaming, you probably shouldn't be buying a laptop at all.

I'm a confident enough woman to admit my shortcomings. I did actually get the specs for what I should look for from the computer guy at the high school and my brother who is a computer programmer.  It has the memory, processor and all the other stuff I was told to get but just look like a bunch of numbers and letters to me.The things that really matter to me:  I really like the feel of the keyboard and the smooth depression of them.  I love the color (red), and the feel of the aluminum.  I had gotten an HP laptop before I got this one and I really hated the feel of the keyboard and I didn't think it functioned as well as this one.  The biggest problem was the touchpad mouse which led me to return the computer.  SO, this was something I was really looking to be better on this ASUS. I wasn't dissapointed.  The texture of the pad and movement of the cursor is vastly better.  It doesn't take a herculean force to push or hold down the mouse buttons.  I do have to admit I still didn't like some of the goofy \"fancy\" functions of the touchpad.  Though not as bad as the HP, I still occasionally would have the screen get bigger or smaller and some other random mouse movement.  I ended up turning off most of the ELAN \"smartpad\" functions and it is now just what I like -lowtech. As for battery life, I actually called ASUS before I bought to ask them because I didn't see that in the product description, I was told that it is a five hour battery.  I think it is at least that long even while on the internet.  I am very pleased with how long I can sit and not have to plug in.I am all-around happy and glad I got this laptop and pleased with the price.

COST: $39.99 from Amazon with free shipping. I just received and installed mine 2 days ago, and staying connected has been a breeze!  So if you've already purchased this laptop, are seeing the same problems with connectivity, and can't afford to mail it back to the manufacturer for loss of time and efforts, all you need to do is replace this tiny little 1\"x1.5\" card. Go here for further details: http://justtechtips.com/posts/solve-atheros-ar9485-wireless-connection-issues-in-asus-a53e-laptop/-----------------------------------Everything you've read about the speakers is true.  They are HORRIFIC!  That said, this laptop has been a lifesaver in many respects.  It holds its own as I have been a Web Design student for the past several months, which means I have multiple programs opened at once, and there is seldom a hitch.  When there is a hitch, it's usually Adobe Dreamweaver that coughs up a fur ball and suddenly dies.  So be sure to save your work, no matter what it is, and keep backing up your stuff whenever you can!I've had this laptop for almost 6 months now and have noticed it has a problem holding a wireless signal. (See update above) This is true for both DSL and U-Verse with an INID box newly installed on the side of my house today!  The third, and perhaps final technician from my ISP has suggested we purchase a wireless signal booster.  The second technician said an INID box would not help, and was correct....but I digress.  I do believe something is awry with the wireless network adapter, but I am hesitant to contact ASUS after what I've read about having to send my laptop in.  No can do right now. I'm in the middle of school!  So, six months in, I might be forced to replace the network adapter myself, but will wait for further signs of mayhem before I do.  That said, you're pretty much getting what you pay for with this product.  Don't expect miracles.  If this is all you can afford right now, go for it.  I had to barter for mine because times are tight right now and I didn't even have the cash available for the purchase.There is a keyboard cover plate that is flimsy, and I doubt I'll be able to pound away on this keyboard for too many years (as I did with my HP Pavilion laptop- 6 yrs!), but my old HP laptop became too sluggish for web design and just couldn't handle the demands of multiple browser windows being open along with Adobe Photoshop and Dreamweaver activity, and Microsoft Word activity all at once.

It was obvious the email was not written by someone that has a grasp of the English language. It was almost like reading one of those emails you get from someone trying to scam you into opening an account that they will deposit money into. Anyway, after trying all the suggestions, I still have the same problem. They send me another email telling me to download a new update to the video card which had to be done through a third party web sight which didn't seem to be very secure. After downloading the update, My laptop gave me the message that it was not compatible with the video card I have. I answered there customer survey wanting to know what I thought about their customer service. I asked them to send me a disc with any updates I need.

The problem mainly was that it would not charge when this occurred. Finally after talking to Asus tech they said to send it to a repair center. So I did. Three weeks later it comes back and it still has the same problem. I am not impressed. My daughter has a 3 yr old Gateway laptop that has given her no problems at all.

It still works great and I still get around 3.5- 4 hours of battery life without it being plugged  to the charger and this mainly searching the web, youtube videos, fb, reading. If I start watching a movie or playing a high graphics game it basically reduces the battery by another hour. I mainly use the computer under save energy mode and that's because it works nearly just as fast as in balance performance for the tasks I mostly work on. I usually charge the computer twice a day, mainly because I use it pretty much during the whole day. I also bought the Kingston ValueRam 4GB PC3-10600 CL9 204-Pin SODIMM Notebook Memory and installed it. It was a great buy for under 30 dollars and it is welcomed storage.Pros:- The battery is really great (after a year i still get a good 4 hours of use without charger)- No problems thus far (no auto shutdown, occasional freeze up but not often enough to be a problem)- Plays games great.. I usually play at low or medium because I like to save power, and sometime at high it stutters- Good camera for what it is. The pictures are not of this world, but it does take good shots and is good quality for skype.- IT IS SO QUITE: I can't hear it, like at all. My previous laptops where so load, that this is a welcome improvement.- IT STAYS COOL: It RARELY gets out. I love this feature, I can have it in my lab and it just refuses to get beyond warm if it gets warm. (like it get warm mainly when watching a hd video or a high specs game)Cons:- Speakers are a bit low (if there is any other noise in the room just a bit too loud, the speakers are barely audible.

I bought it for the price without looking at battery life, but I typically use it all day (as a law student; with Word, Excel, Firefox, etc. open) without it dying on me- Great color; I love the red aluminum inside panel (where the keyboard is)- Sturdy build- Never overheats! Every other laptop I've owned or used has heated up with use, especially if set down on a blanket. But it always stays nice and cool! I don't know that much about computers, but I suspect that this lends to the great performance and battery life as well.- Speakers are surprisingly good. I frequently watch movies on it with no problem.Cons:- The front cover is plastic. I was expecting aluminum like the inside panel. Not bad, but definitely not as nice as I thought it would be. It scuffs/scratches.- A bit bulky for daily carrying (I bring it to and from campus every day). It's definitely thicker than it appears in the pictures.- A small thing: The trackpad mouse button is really loud, and a bit stiff. I laughed when I read this in other reviews, but surprisingly, it's something I actually noticed. Also, the trackpad itself isn't the most sensitive, but that might be something I could change in the settings. You can get around the loud/stiff clicker problem by just tapping on the trackpad itself to click, but not for left-clicking.Overall: Not the most elegant beast, but a great computer at a great price. I couldn't be happier.**As an aside, I also added 4GB of RAM.

I have read so many bad reports on HP that I refused for years to consider a laptop but I finally caved.  Prices are higher but I did find two deal I thought seemed really good.  This and an Acer on the Acer website which was almost identical only it was black and had a second generation i5.I settled on the Asus because I know several who've owned acers and have had keyboard trouble and as trivial as it is, I really dislike black computers.  I also chose this one for the ice cool technology.So, I ordered it with the extra 4 gig of ram for 22 bucks.  I got the Laptop first.  First thing I did was pop in the battery, a real easy task.  Then I turned it on.  Loaded up just fine.  Not as fast as I would have thought but faster by far than what I had desktop wise.  It's an old Compaq with 1 gig ram.  A backup comp as my main died years ago.  Anyway, laptop loaded quick.  Graphics obviously are basic but they are suitable for basic use, web browsing, basic MMO like free to play MMO's. DVD works well and as advertised, it didn't heat up really at all.  Under heavy use after about 5 to 8 hrs of use you can feel the area around the vents get quite warm but go back to just browsing and it will cool instantly off.  I was impressed with that.  Touchpad is really sensitive but it works just fine.  Under the 4 gig of ram it was fine, though not as speedy as I thought but I did add the extra 4 and it made a fair difference.  Not huge but enough that I noticed things ran a lot smoother so I'd recommend popping it in.  Direction on that are horrid.  So let me tell you, make sure you have the smallest phllips head you can find.  You will remove the battery first then the back panel, the smaller panel in width anyway.  The memory is right there in a small little area on the right.  You pop it in at an angle and gently push it down until the metal clips grab ahold.Battery life is O-Kay.  Not great.  I haven't fully timed it but I'd say 4 hours is about accurate.All in all I'm pleased.  Like I said it's for basic use really but it's a light machine and does a great job so far and stays relatively cool.  The price is right at 450 too.  This machine is NOT worth 610 USD.  I've seen plenty of i7s and even i5s with graphics cards at 600 USD.  But at 450 this is a fair price for a pretty good little machine.  College kids would love this machine and probably older folk looking for something simple.", "Date": "July 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS A53E-AS52-WT is a Good general purpose computer", "Author": "LANGUY", "ReviewID": "R1EOCLW5WE0L7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ASUS A53E-AS52-WT is a good general purpose computer.  I purchased this system about 1 month ago and have been very satisfied with it.  I did purchase an addition 4G of RAM for this system to bring it to 8G.  My family uses this system for Email, web browsing, and Microsoft Office (purchased separately). The packaging for this system is made from recycled materials.  The setup was very easy, and it only took a few minutes before I was up and running on the Internet.  I also like that it comes with a 1 year accidental damage coverage.

First, the images Amazon shows for the exterior of the black model are actually of a matte brown variation not sold by Amazon. The interior shots are correct with the brushed aluminum, but the exterior is actually a glossy black with a pattern of grey rectangle outlines. I personally hate patterns on a laptop and do not feel that this specific pattern goes well with the aluminum interior. I'm really annoyed at Amazon for making this error.Second, the mouse buttons with the trackpad are really loud. I'm not a tech person, but I'm pretty sure it's the actual mechanism making the clicking (not the hardware) which means I can't fix it. It's an annoying sound to me and I'm sure it would be to everyone else around me as well.I will say that the inside looks really sleek with the aluminum, black keys, and vibrant display. And Amazon delivered the computer 2 days after I ordered (using standard shipping) which is impressive. But I haven't gone in to really use the computer because I'm still debating if those 2 problems are deal breakers.", "Date": "May 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007MW16OS"}}
