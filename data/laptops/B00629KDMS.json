As a writer and a researcher I *must* have a functioning computer to make a living. This computer had the specs I needed at a price that my very limited budget could manage.  I purchased the computer from this retailer because the seller provided replacement OS media along with the product key. .I know that most computers don't come with OS software media anymore because consumers are expected to create their own recovery discs. I'm willing to do this, but I also wanted the peace of mind that having manufacturer-created media provides. I was also gratified by the fact that the seller is a Microsoft-certified refurbisher as opposed to a fly-by-night dealer.With its all-black (except for hinges) aluminum alloy finish, it is a very nice looking machine with a responsive keyboard, although not as \"stiff\" as on the old ThinkPads. Still, as a touch typist, I feel as though I am typing on a real keyboard instead of smashing a mushy pad, which is refreshing. The screen is a nice size and has good resolution.  The machine itself feels solid but is not too heavy. The computer was advertised as \"very good\" but looked almost like a brand-new computer out of the box. Along with the OS, Microsoft Security Essentials, Adobe Reader and Open Office were all pre-installed on the computer, which was a nice touch. I have my own licensed copy of Office software; I appreciate the fact that not everyone does.I ordered the computer on a Saturday; it was shipped on Monday and arrived on Wednesday, on the short end of the stated shipping window for expedited shipping (2 to 6 business days).  I paid extra for expedited shipping because every day without a computer equates to lost income. The shipping window for standard shipping was 4 to 14 business days -- way too slow for me, especially considering that the Memorial Day holiday would have been involved. The computer arrived well packed and cushioned, but I noticed through tracking the package online that it was only insured for $50. I am assuming that if the computer had arrived damaged that the seller would have offered a full refund, although the return policy states that a 15% restocking fee is normally charged for returns.I had a question about shipping and wrote to the merchant, who responded within a few hours. I also had some issues with the machine shutting itself down without warning for a day or so after the computer first arrived; I wrote to the merchant who again responded within a few hours.  Fingers crossed, the problem seems to have resolved itself and I have had no further problems.I give this item/seller 4.5 stars. The only detractions are the shipping and restocking charges, which I consider to be a bit steep,  plus the very short warranty (30 days). The short warranty is a minor sticking point for me, because I purchased an insurance/warranty policy for the computer as soon as I determined that it was in good working order. But other sellers offer more generous 1-year warranties for refurbished machines.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00629KDMS"}}
