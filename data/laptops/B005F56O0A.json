{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Runs Mavericks!", "Author": "I love Linux", "ReviewID": "R3REJF305ZB2Y6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I broke my White Macbook and I wanted a new one but I couldn't afford to buy new.  Some research pointed me to the Macbook Pro A 1266This is a old duo core machine that came with 2gb RAM and a 160 gb hard drive.  No spring chicken.  However it runs Mavericks which isthe latest OS from Apple as  of 2013.  Key is to add RAM.  It will accept up to 6gb of PC2 5300 RAM.  A SSD isn't a bad ideal aswell.  Some of you may be content with Snow Leopard or Lion but remember that Apple will pull support for those older OS X versions soon.You may continue to see updates but your system may not receive critical patches.  The Macbook Pro is the way too go.  They are moredurable then the White Macbooks.  These older machines tend to go for less then $300.00 and with RAM and SSD you could have a decent systemfor well under $500.00.  The really cool thing is Mavericks is FREE.  Compare that to Windows 8.1 which costs over $100.00Pros:  Inexpensive compared to used newer machines.  None of that case chipping bs of the White Macbooks.  Great screen.  Solid build and nice keyboard.  A cheap media card reader will allow you to add a SD card.  Supports Mavericks  OS X  10.9Cons:  Older and parts can be hard to find plus laptops of this age can just stop working and there is  no Applecare for them.  A bit on the heavy side and batteries may need to be replaced.  Costs more then comparable Windows laptops of the  same era.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hope it continues to work.", "Author": "David Kahnke", "ReviewID": "R1AOSJO1YRFYZV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some times it don't boot but when I hold down the 'D' Key then it works but it seems slow", "Date": "September 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Applepro is Great!", "Author": "Nellie", "ReviewID": "RWG291UMG1XKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my Apple MacBook Pro.  In the past I have struggled with other laptopsbut the Apple works so easily and its very cool looking too as its keys light up,Another thing I like is that the keys seem to be concave just a little which makesit feel like your fingers just slide into position each time you move them.I wouldn't trade it for any other!", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wrong one", "Author": "Heather B.", "ReviewID": "RLANMTBE2YQ9H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It didn't do what I needed it to do so I had to return it plus I accidently ordered the wrong :(", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2Ghz\n120Gb Harddrive\n2048Mb RAM\nDVDRW Drive\nOS X 10.4.9", "Name": "Apple MacBook Pro A1226 15\" Laptop (Intel Core 2 Duo 2.2Ghz, 120GB Hard Drive, 2048Mb RAM, DVDRW Drive, OS X 10.4.9)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/318rX3-NPAL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005F56O0A"}}
