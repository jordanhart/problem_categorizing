Kirk", "ReviewID": "R2JN7RAH4L9NH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the price and feature of this laptop blew me away and i had to buy itI was in need of a new PC and was in quite a dilemma as i needed a fast and powerful laptop (because i couldn't get a desktop) with lots of space and with a decent graphics processor but i was on a very limited budget.After much searching i decided on this one and I have been madly in love with it ever since it arrived (although it did take me 10 minutes to find the on button )I have abused this thing and it has taken everything in strideI overclocked the CPU to 2.2ghz and on top of that i leave it running nearly constantly to seed torrents and when im using it I am running graphics intensive games like Oblivion (YES , THIS THING CAN RUN OBLIVION ON NEARLY FULL SPECS) so needless to say i should be in constant danger of overheating. however I bought an cheapo cooling pad from amazon (the one that has 3 fans and a blue LED http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032R858C/ref=oss_product) to compensate and neither the fan or the laptop have given me any problems.It also survived a pretty major drop and is no worse for the wear.My one and only grievance with this laptop (which is a problem i would have had with any other laptop) is the keyboard and trackpad. I immediately realized i needed to buy a mouse for this thing (the mouse and cooling pad were about $30 be prepared to factor that into your budget) because the trackpad is dreadful. The keyboard just takes some getting used to because its nearly flat and I rely on feel, more than sight to type and the added numpad really takes up a lot of space that i would have preferred to have been used giving the other keys some extra room or spacingthe last thing i want to mention is the battery. I cant speak to its battery life as i've never used it for more than an hour without it being plugged in but i think two hours would be an accurate guess as to its battery life. SO if unplugged time is a major concern to you you may want to get a different laptop or consider buying an extra or extended life battery to compensate.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Amazing computer!!!!!", "Author": "Efre", "ReviewID": "R3ICPCTLKXJYYM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "** Amazing computer, good price, excellent performance very very fast.**Regading the seller ( tigerdirect ) excellent service, computer was on time and the product ( refurbish ) looks  like new!!!!** In general I'm very happy with my new computer.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bad Experience", "Author": "D. Wolfson", "ReviewID": "R324E5OKSLH362", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was a refurbished laptop from Tiger Direct.  The add implied that is was fully inspected, blah, blah, blah.  Nobody could possibly have looked at it after it was returned.  It had a red stripe running horizontally through the middle of the screen and another one running vertically on the right side of the screen (These flaws could not have been missed and I'm sure were the reason the laptop was returned in the first place).The only positive thing I have to say is that when I described the problem they immediately set up a return paying for the postage through UPS.  I also did receive a credit on my Visa but not until weeks later (I was close to contacting them again).On the other hand, the Gateway seemed like a nice laptop (but I'll never know, I ended up getting a NEW Toshiba Satellite).", "Date": "September 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good laptop", "Author": "Victor H.

But i received it with one key damage (hinge kit). I have the option to ask for a refund but i found the hinge kit in ebay and i prefer to the the replacement by myselft.The laptop works just fine in my opinion, sometime when the laptop was hybernating doesn't start up again until i restart it, i think is winsdows 7 issue, not a laptop problem.Also, sometimes i need to restart windows audio service, again, i think is win 7 problem.Overall, i think this laptop is the best option in terms of price, but next time i will going to buy a better brand even if i pay a little more money.Note: This laptop is refurbished.", "Date": "September 5, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "With powerful 2GHz AMD Athlon II X2 M300 Dual-Core processing, impressive graphics\nWindows 7 Home Premium (64-bit) and on-the-go connectivity you can multitask with ease", "Name": "Gateway NV5214U 15.6\" 4GB 320GB DVDRW Notebook PC", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31iaweYc8HL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ID6DJI"}}
