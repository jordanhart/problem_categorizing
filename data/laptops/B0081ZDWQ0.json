It does this well.  I also have a few games loaded on it and it runs them well with their settings turned down.  I purchased this on Monday of black Friday deal week (2012) for $329 and then used Microsoft's windows upgrade offer (windowsupgradeoffer.com  $15) to install windows 8.  The verdict is still out on windows 8 but for the notebook I feel I got a good value.  I especially like that it has a HDMI port so it is just one cable going to my TV for video and sound.If i needed a second I would definitely buy another at the sale price and possibly at regular price.  I gave it four stars because I would say I like it not love it.  It would have to be faster to love it but that would also cost $500+. Overall I would recommend this notebook for streaming video, light gaming, paper typing, and internet.", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good product, excellent for students", "Author": "Eric \"Eric L.

Below is a list of things I thought were worth mentioning. Hopefully I will remember to update this over time.It has a very pretty glossy finish. The only negative about this thus far is that it attracts smudges and fingerprints very easily.Set up was really simple and fast. I did not have to uninstall many programs.This is the first laptop I have had with the island style keyboard. It will take some time to get used to. In my opinion, it feels a bit clunky.The optical drive is kind of loud. So far I have only used it to install a few games. I am hoping that it is not quite so loud while playing dvds.Speaking of games, if you like to play The Sims 3, it works wonderfully.The Windows Experience Index is 4.6The webcam could use improvements.The track pad is not jumpy and the zoom is fun to play with. The scrolling is going to take some practice though.With default settings, the speakers kind of suck. (What I did to make it better: start/control panel/hardware and sound/sound/right click on speakers/headphones and choose properties/enhancements/check loudness equalization/apply)Update one:Thankfully the optical drive is not loud while playing dvds. However, something I have noticed is that when you open it while it is laying flat on a surface (the laptop) the disc holder thingy will scrape along the surface.I had an issue after using sleep mode for the first time. After doing so, whenever I put it on hibernate, I would find that hours later it had turned itself on...by itself. I did quickly find a solution though and it has not repeated this since.Update two (a year later):Still a very good laptop. My least favorite thing is still the optical drive. It is just cheap and flimsy. (It does work though) The only new issue that has popped up for me involves the trackpad. It occasionally just slows down for some reason. I usually just press F3 to deactivate it and then again to reactivate and then it begins working correctly again. At this point I have played many games using this laptop and although you may have to adjust the settings, it still runs wonderfully.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great price.

Randall", "ReviewID": "R3ARHTX66H3KV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for my wife as a lightning deal on Cyber Monday and picked it up for 329.99.  For this price point, I really felt like I couldn't do better.  The laptop seems to be pretty solid with good hinges (sounds like a dumb point unless you have had a laptop with crappy hinges).  The only part that seems kind of cheap is the keyboard, but for the price I can't complain too much.It comes with an intel core i3 processor which is what really sold me (I could not find the core i series processors at this price point on any other laptops), as the HD and RAM can be upgraded at a pretty inexpensive price.  My wife was adamant about having windows 8 so I purchased the pro upgrade at a reduced price through MS (after rebate from Dell, the upgrade is free). The upgrade went fairly well, however I had to do a bios upgrade in order to get the laptop screen to work with win 8 (the upgrade would seem to freeze after a certain point on me, but once i hooked it up to an external screen i was able to complete it, then found on the dell website that this is a known issue for this model).I did a clean upgrade to 8 so i  can't speak to the performance out of the box with all the bloatware, but for my wife's purposes (viewing videos, pictures, facebook, youtube, etc.) it runs great and is very quick on win 8.Just a note on the weight.  The 8lbs reported by amazon is the weight including shipping materials.  The actual weight of the laptop is around 5lbs with a 15.7\" screen and we are happy with that size/weight.  We have not had a need to really test battery life so I can't speak to that aspect of it.Overall we are very happy with this product and would consider buying it again.", "Date": "December 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Build quality is very poor.Wifi issues and more", "Author": "Udayakiran", "ReviewID": "R2I90J5PIFUXMS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this on thanks giving deal so i went with it.Being a dell fan, i wished for a better build quality but this one is so poor that i am afraid any given bad day, if this falls out of hand, there will be no use of this.The keyboard is such a junk and  i fear it might break when typing. If you get this below 300, then its worth the buy. My suggestion, better look for other inspiron laptops. Not this one.After 10 days of use(12/7/12)  Not sure if i got the defective one but i have returned the laptop back. Appearance of blue screen every day, wifi connection issues made me return it. Now the cost has shoot up to 529 which absolutely the laptop does not worth. Please do not buy this laptop for 529. You get v good laptops with i5 in ASUS and HP for below $500.

I then went about setting it up and personalizing and used briefly before putting aside to due traveling. When I got back I went to start the computer and it asked for my password. I could not recall adding a password, and if I had done so, surely it was something easy right? Well, I put in everything I could think to no avail.So since I had yet to register the computer I went ahead and did so and while on the phone with tech support (I was able to get one free tech support call), I asked about accessing my computer without a passwrod. Well, I was informed by Dell that I had to have a Dell USB flash drive to do a system recovery (just for a password??) They overnighted one and then called two days later (I missed that call). They called back this morning and walked me through the process of a recovery. But during the call the computer indicated it could not do a recovery because there was an error. The tech support guy said it was the hard drive (this is a new computer remember) and they will send me out a box with a paid for mailing label - I was to mail the laptop back, they will fix it and send it back. WTF??Seriously there had to have been a better way. I really don't think the computer is bad, but I guess you get what you pay for and I paid only 350. Goes to show you. I would recommend going on Dell's site instead and read all reviews and find a better computer. But then come to think of it, I did that years ago and that Dell laptop tanked after a few years too (and could not be recovered at all). Maybe don't buy a Dell.

Now, on to the laptop.I bought this during the black friday sale as a present for my daughter.  Consequently, it wasn't put into use until Christmas day.  From the first full system startup, the wifi randomly dropped connection to the router.  We have 5 other computers in the house and this laptop was the only one with the issue. Additionally, it would \"blue screen\" when operating on battery power.  After a bit of searching online, a number of people with similar problems suggested the power management needed tweaking.  None of the proposed measures fixed the problem.  Thinking a complete system reload might help, I proceeded down that path...this didn't help either.  Two usb ports then decided to join the fray and quit working.  Thankfully all of these problems surfaced during the return period and Amazon issued a refund.
