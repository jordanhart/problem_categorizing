I am new to Windows 8.0 but I am getting used to it.  This computer does everything that I want a laptop to do.  I am sure there are more expensive models that would do a little more but I do not need aGoliath.

I LOVE my new laptop.  I will say it's not for everyone, as it is a bit more fragile feeling than other laptops, but I am not rough on my electronics and if you are not used to windows 8 and/or do not like change, perhaps this isn't for you.  I love the touch screen -  very responsive.  I have had it for four weeks and it seems to be a perfect fit for me!  <3 windows 8 and <3 my new HP Pavilion Touchsmart!", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "May depend on the person!", "Author": "Mom of  2", "ReviewID": "R124KHH43EYRLM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before this computer I had windows vista, a Gateway computer. Windows 8 is much different that Vista, quite a change but I also had a new windows phone that is very much the same as this so it wasn't hard to adjust, but my husband doesn't  feel the same, to him this it is a huge change. T he laptop itself is great quality, battery lasts a  long time and seems very nice so far. I also love the touch screen but not my hubby, doesn't like the finger prints on the screen. So I would recommend this computer but that may be a personal preference.", "Date": "March 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP has the best computers", "Author": "Kari Marx", "ReviewID": "R1HOVJDYWV36AY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Never a problem with any of the 4 HP computers I've owned over the years.

The transition from Windows XP to this was just too much for me.  Amazon allowed me to return it for a full refund and I replaced it with a Windows 7 laptop.  Imagine my surprise to find that except for the touchscreen interface, 7 is very much like 8.  However, I am much more comfortable with point & click, so I will stay with this one until Microsoft abandons 7.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the price", "Author": "Chaz", "ReviewID": "R2XGONJH7PB29A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop worked right out of the box and is still working without a hitch..

That being said, I really enjoy this machine so far.  I use my computer for a bit of clerical work, lots of internet surfing, social media, copying family videos, photo editing, and for writing.  Can't get used to the fact that there is touchscreen...so I rarely use it.
