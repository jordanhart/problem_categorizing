Gravley \"baggage1\"", "ReviewID": "R2RVAG8TO5H3EY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I waited to ordered this until I could get it with the 4th Generation Intel i5-4242y  with the 1920x1080 resolution screen and the 802.11AC Bluetooth WLAN options. I wanted something for work that would last all day without having to use power chords. I have to say it does that in spades with time left to use at home. The solid aluminum case is impressive but a bit slick and worry about dropping it. It comes with Windows 8.1 out of the box. As a Vista user it's different. I have installed Office, and work a rounds for the start button and gadgets. It's fast! Starts from scratch in about half a minute and from sleep, pretty much as soon as you open it up. I work with clients filling out forms and it's fun to watch them when I separate the device and hand it to them to correct any information. I use it primarily as a laptop for work. Since it comes apart, it offers non standard ways to use view email, shop or do research. The touch screen is nice to make things as large as you need to view or move around the screen. This will be my last laptop/hybrid for quite some time. The sound is very good with the beats audio, the camera and microphone are good for video chatting. Haven't used many or any of the apps as of yet, not much the time to play with it. I like the keyboard but will reappoint some of the buttons I miss from my other laptop keyboards. The Clickpad takes some getting used to, can't configure it like a touch pad. I like to modify things to my taste and this offers enough options. I had an issue with a 3rd party application and the help was very sufficient to remedy the problem. No moving parts, stays cool, no noise and has a backlit keyboard.", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "HP Spectre x2 - an excellent hybrid", "Author": "James J. Buono \"PhotoShopper\"", "ReviewID": "R3Q5F3NR1VWHFQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the specter X2 or about a month now and I'm very pleased with it.  The HD  screen is bright and sharp with good color.  The battery does last all day even with the tablet separated from the keyboard.  It doesn't use a fan for cooling and so there is no noise and yet the case does not get very warm.  It warms a little when playing games for example, but not enough to be a problem.The Haswell chip is certainly speedy enough for everyday tasks.  I've used it to run Lightroom with no problems.Having a 13 inch screen tablet makes it easy to surf the web, read the mail, watch movies or TV shows and use as a general purpose computer.  The weight of the tablet alone is about 2 pounds.  This is, of course, heavier than an 8 or 9 inch tablet.  It is about the same weight as the surface pro two, here's where the lack of a fan makes up for the larger screen.  The keyboard is quite nice, it's aluminum shall feels very sturdy, the keyboard is back lit and  the keys are certainly large and they feel as good as any other laptop keyboard I've tried.It's a shame that this hybrid does not get the attention it deserves.  Compared it to the MacBook Air and the  surface pro 2 it stacks up pretty well.  The MacBook Air, of course, doesn't have a touch screen and the surface pro has a smaller screen and a fan.This hybrid gets downgraded just a little because it is limited to 4 GB of ram and a 128 gb drive.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Compared to other similarly priced hybrid/tablets this has everything I need", "Author": "James", "ReviewID": "R1IK2BVGW683FS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have been searching for a while for an enterprise grade hybrid tablet with a larger screen and finally found it.  Things that are great:Battery life - 8 hours running youtube (and connected to keyboard)Screen size - nice to have a larger screen unlike the surface or Lenovo HelixKeyboard - full size makes it easier to type.  More durable than surface or samsung 700.Design - strong and sleekOne thing lacking is on the distribution front.  HP is not selling this via it's partner program only direct to consumer.
