{"Reviews": [{"Title": "NEVER BUY ANOTHER COMPUTER FROM DELL", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RG3Z6H2543QVE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought the 14Z Ultrabook. It came with WINDOWS 8 installed. I bought a Microsoft Pro Pack to upgrade to WINDOWS 8 PRO. When I put the code, the computer lost its original activation and the upgrade was not installed nor activated.I called Dell and they told me that their Laptops now are not compatible with any thing related to the WINDOWS 8 OS, even if it is from Microsoft. They could not help me to get the original activation again either, because they are not using the 25 digit  code anymore. The Sticker comes without that number too.I called Microsoft and after a few minutes working with my Laptop, they found that the number for my OEM windows code was empty. They asked me to call Dell again and ask for the number.Dell told me again that they don't use that number any more. I asked for technical support (my Laptop was one week old) and they told me that it was going to cost me because when I installed the WINDOWS 8 PRO Pack I LOST MY WARRANTY.Then I went back to Microsoft and they transfer me to a specialized techincian located in India, and they Waive all fees. The technician worked for more than 4 hours to restore my Windows 8 without loosing all the info and software licenses that I already had installed, They succedded, but they were unable to install the WIN 8 PRO Upgrade.I had to keep my computer because I have installed a lot of software and loaded it with information, but I wont buy another computer from Dell in my lifetime. By the way this American Laptop is produced 100% in China.Conclusion: Excellent service from Microsoft and no service at all from Dell; the worst I have ever had from anyone. They only gave me headaches.My recommendation: NEVER BUY A DELL COMPUTER.I want to add two comments, because today May the 3rd. I am still having problems: The activation done by Microsoft lasted until Dell did its first automatic update, Then I lost it again.Then I received this \"private message \" from Dell through FacebookHi,Sorry for the late reply. On your system, you may go to Control Panel> System and Security > System . Look for the WINDOWS ACTIVATION at the bottom of the page and click on a hyperlink. That should activate the Windows operating system.Let me know if it helps.Regards,Fernando Thursday 4:50amMy Reply to Fernando (DELL):Jorge Ros Sr.No Fernando. It doesn't works. First, on Windows activation it says that Product ID is not available. I don't have That ID and there is no way to enter it. Also there is no hyperlink.I have taken the problem on my own and decided that it requires a Radical Solution. I bought two different software: 1) A Windows 8 System Builder Disk and 2) A another set of discs for my Windows Office (Amazon already delivered this).I expect the Windows 8 disks today (They will be delivered today Friday the 3rd. by Amazon). I already backed up all my files and documents.I will reformat the Hard Drive and will do a clean installation of Windows 8 that will be activated with a license ID provided by Microsoft. Then I will reinstall Office. Transfer again my files to the Lap Top, and 3 or 4 other programs that I use and Voil\u00e1 Dell.I am only sad that because I HAD TO SPEND MORE MONEY THAN WHAT I PAID FOR THE LAPTOP; TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM that got worse due to the ignorance of all the people from Dell's Technical Support and the Poor service that I received. (For your Info: Just having to buy a new Windows and an Office amounts to: $207.00 dollars plus my other software, plus my time. All this just to fix problems that should have been taking care under warranty but due to negligence and ignorance.A Few minutes later I added this additional comment:Thursday 4:53amJorge Ros Sr.One more thing: Trust me, to abandon the use of the 25 digit key for an embedded key in the Motherboard that no one can reads has been one of the worst decisions ever made by your company (with the complicity of Microsoft). And almost all of the technicians at customer support were unaware of a solution and lacked the proper training to deal with it.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love this ultrabook.", "Author": "Diane Beck", "ReviewID": "R1XN21P6WESC7Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really like this computer.  I was a little hesitant about getting a Windows 8 machine, but found it very easy to learn to use.  Once I got the hang of it I found it very fast and responsive, easy to move between different applications.  The display is very bright and crisp and the speakers are a big improvement over my older Dell laptops.
