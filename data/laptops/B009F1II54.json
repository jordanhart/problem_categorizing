{"Reviews": [{"Title": "You can do it all with the Taichi", "Author": "Lightfoot \"AGB\"", "ReviewID": "R2MO4PAF66G4E4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this DH71 11.6 inch model for about 3 or 4 months now. 5 stars overall because it is awesome, you can do it all with this machine (work, play, media, easily connect to multiple 24\" external monitors or your TV). And I really like this baby. I use it for work (engineer) and for play at home. You need to purchase the Taichi \"suit\" cover in order to get the full functionality out of this thing. The \"Taichi suit\" protects your investment, supports it at 2 different angles in tablet mode, and supports it at one angle in laptop mode. Definitely get the suit, and learn how to use it. It works very well.I didn't experience all of the driver problems that others had complained about in past reviews (especially in early 2013), but I didn't buy this baby until late summer, so maybe Asus had all the kinks worked out by then. That said I did resolve some issues...Tips on how to be successful with the Asus Taichi:- First of all, get the i7 processor. I have no experience with the i5 processor, but why settle for less than i7? Be safe. Go for the i7.- Be careful about downloading win 8.1... I don't think the drivers are ready for it, so it screwed up my graphics and other things. Just stick with win 8 for some time until you are positive that Taichi is ready for 8.1. I had to do a system refresh and reinstall everything just to get back to win 8. Maybe a restore would have worked. Just be careful about upgrading to win 8.1.- Outside screen cracked... Like I said I was careless. I tossed it around the car. I was using the flimsy sleeve without any other kind of protection. I stacked it with other things in my car. Bad move. Somewhere along the way, I noticed a crack along the corner of the screen. Huge bummer. But luckily the basic \"accidental damage insurance protection\" covered the cost of repairs ($110). So after hat experience I purchased the Taichi \"suit\" for $30 on the Microsoft store. Get it. Like I said, get the suit. You need the suit to protect this device.- Multiple external monitors (for work)... This thing is fast and powerful. I use it with (2) 24\" external monitors at work and it is awesome. I use the mini VGA adaptor that comes with it to connect to one monitor. I use a USB-HDMI graphics adaptor that I bought from Best Buy for the other monitor. I really like using windows 8 at work with multiple monitors, and this machine is the heart of my operation. I run multiple applications and regularly plug into and unplug from multiple monitors. It took a few tries to figure it out, but now it works every time. When I get to work I just plug in each monitor (one with mini VGA on left side and one with USB-HDMI graphics adaptor on right side), swipe in from the right side, click devices, second screen, extend... voila, I am up and running every day. To unplug from multiple monitors, don't worry, just unplug and be free. Enjoy the light weight and versatile Taichi in your meetings and travels!- Using in laptop mode... this is actually a non-issue. In laptop mode, the touchpad works great. You don't need a touch screen in laptop mode. Learn to use the touchpad!- Touchpad... Learn to use the touchpad like I said. It is powerful like a Mac touchpad. You can do things with 2 fingers, 3 fingers, and basically the same wipe gestures that you can use on the touchscreen in the tablet mode. You can use those same gestures on the touchpad in the laptop mode. You will become very efficient once you adopt the touchpad gestures.- Screen brightness auto-adjust... I had some problems with the screen or ambient light sensor so I disabled the auto-adjust of screen brightness. Again this is no something I care about. I am fine with manual screen brightness. That said, the keyboard backlight works very nicely and if you haven't used keyboard backlight before, you are in for a treat. It is the only way to see the keyboard at night, if you are someone like me who has to look at the keyboard every now and again as you type...- Protect it, purchase the \"Taichi suit\" and use it as a tent! This machine is solid, if you protect. I was very careless with it at first. I didn't have a good cover for it. The flimsy sleeve that comes with it, doesn't provide much protection. You need to buy the \"Suit\" for somewhat better protection. I still wish I could find some more rugged protection cases for when I use this at work in the field. The suit is a good investment for $30-40. Get it.- Drive space... you only have 256 GB of drive space, so you need to be selective. No problem. Use a server, or work on the cloud and be careful as to which folders you sync on your machine. Just use cloud services for your data. These sold state machines simply do not have the capacity to store a billion songs, files, and photos. You need to use office 360, dropbox, google drive, or one of those things. And put your media somewhere on a cloud as well. It is safer on the cloud anyway. You could break this machine tomorrow. SO you want to have your important stuff stored somewhere else.- Win 8... Learn how to use win 8. I think some people are leaving bad reviews for this machine simply because they don't like win 8. It is better than win 7. WIn 8 is like win 7, but with metro widget mode as well. You just touch the win key to switch between win 7 and win 8. Ok, I am sorry the start icon is gone in the corner of the desktop display. But you can easily find and learn the win key shortcuts. For example \"win x\" will bring up a menu that includes control panel. To turn off your machine just go with ctrl+alt+delete and turn I off there. No big deal folks!- Desktop Mode vs Metro mode... You can choose the default in your browser, so for instance you may want to run IE in metro mode and use that browser in the win 8 metro mode... the icons and so forth are bigger and easier to navigate with your finger. But I also ue IE for searching stuff in laptop mode. For browsing on chrome, I run chrome in desktop mode. How to change? Just click on internet options or options in chrome, and right there at the top there is an option to switch to window 8 metro mode or desktop mode.- Play with settings... You can always play with settings and notifications to customize your machine. For example I use an outlook exchange service, so I was getting double notifications - one from outlook, and one from the email app, every time an email hit my inbox. I disabled the notifications in the email app and that fixed it. You can also adjust sound settings. In desktop mode it is a lot like win 7 to adjust settings. In win 8 mode you just swipe in from the right and settings is always right there a swipe away...- Get a USB hub... you don't need 3 USB ports on a laptop. Just get a USB hub and you can expand your number of USB connections as needed. I use this for my flash drive, etc. at work. Otherwise 2 USB ports is fine.This is a well designed machine. I am not a super hero with computers. This machine has made me quicker. It is much lighter than my old Asus clunker. That said, I hope this thing lasts for at least 2 more years. I really this baby! The only thing is I wish maybe the screen was a tad bigger. Maybe I should have gotten the bigger, 13 inch screen. The 11.6 inch screen looks tiny at work scrunched in between my two 24\" external monitors... But on the other hand, the 11.6\" model is nice and small and lightweight in the field and on the go. 11.6 is probably nicer in tablet mode. 13\" would be better at work.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Ultrabook/Tablet Combo", "Author": "Arthur", "ReviewID": "RT0DMR1Y7UV9R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am currently typing this review on my brand new Asus Taichi. I went with the 11 inch core i7 256 gig ssd model.I did lots of research before my purchase. I am a mechanical engineering student, and I wanted a portable laptop that could run all my engineering software. My friend bought the Surface Pro, and raved about it. I went to a Best Buy, and tested it myself. It worked pretty well, and I left impressed. I especially liked the type cover and digitizer. I also tested the Lenovo IdeaPad Yoga 13 13.3-Inch Convertible Touchscreen Ultrabook (Gray), and the Dell XPS 12 that flips around on the hinge. I stumbled upon the Asus Taichi on CNET one day, and I was impressed. I immediately read all the reviews I could find. Some people loved it, others had bad experiences with returns and defects. I couldn't find the Taichi in stores anywhere, so I wasn't able to test it before buying. After much thought (and a $100 gift card for Amazon), I decided to take a chance and go with the Taichi.Unpacking the Taichi is like Christmas day. The box is cool, and all sorts of goodies are included. The pen includes a battery, and the VGA and ethernet dongles in a little carrying pouch. A handy carrying case, warranty card, instruction manual, and cable ties are also in the box.My first impression was to be shocked at how thin and light this computer really is. Coming from a three year old HP, this was night and day different. The setup process took about ten minutes, and then I went to the asus support website to download all the new drivers. My trackpad worked great until I installed the updated driver. The the gestures stopped working. I reinstalled the old driver and it worked again. Go figure. After that, I installed Creo Pro 2.0 (CAD software), as well as MatLAB. Both work like a charm. Everything is smooth, and there is no lag whatsoever with multiple programs running. People complain about the lack of apps in the Windows store, but I was able to find One Note, Twitter, the Wall Street Journal, Skype, and Dropbox. These are really the only apps I use anyway.The next feature I tested is by far the best. I closed the lid, and BAM, it's a tablet. It is a little heavier than my old Acer Iconia Tab, but not too bad. However, this tablet blows all other tablets away. I can run my Windows apps, I can use my digitizer to take notes and draw, and oh yeah, I can run any Windows program I want. The touch screen is great. I haven't really used the dual screen presentation mode, and I don't see when I would need to do that. I wanted the Taichi to use as a laptop when I needed it, and a tablet when I wanted one. This does that perfectly.The pen input works great on One Note. Writing is smooth with no lag, and the calibration seems spot on. Asus includes a note taking app, but I liked One Note better.I haven't done any drawing and I don't plan on doing very much in the future. I wanted the digitizer to take notes during class, and so far it fits that need perfectly. The pen is also solidly built, and easy to hold. I wish it was a little bit longer for more comfortable writing, but I can't complain too much. There is no place to keep the pen on the laptop, but the carrying case does have a little slot for it. I carry the Taichi around in the case anyway, so this works for me.ProsFast - No lag when switching between apps or running multiple demanding programsLight and Thin - Sometimes I forget it's even in my backpackTouchscreen - Tablet mode works great, very responsiveDigitizer - Pen works great, One Note is freeBluetooth - I can connect my Galaxy S4 to it to transfer files or play music through the speakersScreens - Super high definition, very clearConsBattery - Could last longer. The charger is pretty light and small though so it's not a big dealDrivers - You must update before really using this machine, it really improves performanceMini Ports - Although dongles are included, I wouldn't mind a full size HDMI on hereScaling - Text on screen is small, and Chrome requires zoom for me to view comfortablyHeat - The bottom can get warm, and the area by the hinge above the keyboard gets HOTTo summarize, this is a great machine. I wish it had the Haswell chips inside, but otherwise I would highly recommend the Taichi. I never find myself reaching up to touch the inside screen, so this is not a flaw to me. I also just purchased the Chromium TV thing from Google, and I hope to eventually use that instead of WiDi. Anyone looking for a fast, premium looking and feeling ultrabook with a digitizer should definitely consider the Taichi.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Program on the inside, Play on the outside", "Author": "Nelxon \"artist, animator, programmer, game de...", "ReviewID": "RCCLYVSLRC6XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After months of researching and reading comments, I decided to go with ASUS Taichi 21-DH71.I've had my Tachi for a little over a month now and it is perfect for me because I'm a programmer-artist-animator-game developer.First off, this is replacing my Sony Vaio Laptop and Wacom Cintiq 12 combination I used to carry everywhere - All of those wires and setup just to start work was a nightmare. The Cintiq is nice if you don't need it to be really portable.How do I use My Tachi?For Programming:  I open it and use it just like a laptop - Note: the touchpad is awesome.For Drawing & Animating:  I close it and use it like a Cintiq; however I did buy a numpad for keyboard shortcuts and I lowered the screen resolution to make it feel more like my previous Cintiq.Note: Pressure sensitivity doesn't work in all applications - but it works for the ones I use most. For game development:  Program on the inside, Play on the outside. I love that it eliminates the extra step of deploying to other devices for gameplay and UI testing. That's too cool.The Bad?Battery Life. Solution: Bring the plug - it's not big and clunky.Why did I choose the Tachi 21 instead of the Microsoft Surface?Tachi 21 screen size is bigger.Tachi 21 processor is faster.Tachi 21 hard drive is bigger.Tachi 21 has more USB Ports.Tachi 21 can be used in my lap as a laptop (plus the screen angle can be adjusted)Tachi 21 Dual screen is great for screen sharing.The Tachi 21 isn't for everyone, but it is great for people like me.Hope this review helps someone.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for a student", "Author": "llsnowy", "ReviewID": "R1HKXKDFRXNBVB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, I had not encountered any of the problems that were mentioned for the people who gave it one star - i think it really may be just bad luck for them and they should really get it exchanged.Overall this is a great laptop in terms of:speed: boot time is unbelievable; matlab runs super fastfunctionality: the heaviest task I do is probably matlab, and that works perfectly. When I first got it I had some problems with the trackpad (as in it wouldn't respond to any gestures after resume from sleep mode) but this was fixed by an update from the asus site. I know the 128G is a concern for some people (especially since it only comes with around 50-60G of free space after you install the essentials) but I've loaded my music/files/programs etc. on there and it's more than enough. Plus its USB 3.0 ports means you could just buy a larger external or USB and it'll be just as fast.size: although the 11.6 inch screen needs getting used to at first, the amazing resolution really makes up for the screen size. That being said, it probably wouldn't work for you if you were long sighted... Also, they keyboard is very well-spaced for a 11.6 inch computer. The only flaw would be the small-ish arrow keys.) The weight of it is a huge plus since I carry it around a lot and it feels no heavier than my notebook (that being said it is a tad heavy for a tablet)screen: absolutely amazing. The inner screen is matte and looks incredible in all situations. So far the brightness has been fine in all situations (make sure you turn auto-brightness off to achieve max brightness)keyboard/trackpad: both work perfectly, although the trackpad takes getting used to since it's super-sensitive. I've had no problems with size of keyboard/any unresponsiveness.speakers: probably the best speakers I've seen on a computer.dual screen mode: it's excellent for comparing homework/ showing others your work without having to spin your computer around the whole time.tablet mode: pen input/response is great, even without calibration. If you wanted to play around on it with your fingers however, it might be a little finicky since the resolution is so high most of the time you won't hit what you want exactly. I use the tablet mode to take notes in class on powerpoints and slides (saves a lot on paper; plus you don't lose your notes) and it works great. It's still not AS precise as you may like it to be but all in all my writing is legible and gets the job done.The only con I really had was the battery life: I can squeeze out~4.5 hours if i set brightness to super low and do nothing but take notes. However, usually it lasts for about 3~4 which is fine between classes. Plus, the charger is super portable and light so it's really not a problem to carry around.  (Also people mentioned this before but the outer screen is a total fingerprint magnet). I did notice that in tablet mode my wrist kept hitting the windows button and making it go to the windows8 start-up screen.Overall there's nothing to not like about this computer and I would definitely recommend it if you're going to be carrying a computer around.", "Date": "March 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Combo", "Author": "drpret \"Preetham\"", "ReviewID": "R1G5APDMTUG9YJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had bought two of these, one for myself and one for my inlaws.. It comes well packed in a great box. The Taichi is very stylish and looks great. Setting it up was very easy and it boots up and shuts down in seconds. There was one issue to note: The auto rotate on the tablet side can sometimes turn off. I had to call ASUS Taichi support, which is free and 24/7 dedicated to this product which is great. If this happens to your notebook just access the display settings (resolution page) from the tablet side and check the auto rotate button on. This setting is not available from the notebook side which makes can make this a nightmare if you don't figure this out. Two ASUS tech reps did not know what to do, the third did. This means keep calling until you find a good rep. Now I can kick back and watch movies on the tablet side and crunch out work in the day time on the notebook side.

There service by far worst than the PC!!", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "The hardware is great, but the crapware is insane.", "Author": "Justin", "ReviewID": "R2ON8VI72AS81C", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Against my better judgment I bought this laptop over the Surface pro and I wish I never did.Lets start off with the good, it's only about a half inch bigger than Surface on all sides.  It's well built, and beautiful.  The screens are very high quality, the keyboard and trackpad are the best I have ever used.  It's not so heavy that you can't use it in portrait with one hand (unless you are a very weak person).  The pen works great and windows 8 flies on this thing.Now the bad.First thing you will notice is the inner screen has no touch.  I thought this would be a non issue, you have to be an idiot to reach up and touch the screen involuntarily.  But within the first hour I had reached up to touch it 5 times.  This quickly went from being a dumb thing I did, to being a mistake made by ASUS.Next thing is the crapware.  There's TONS OF IT.  Mostly crap made by ASUS that you will never use.  The good thing is most of it can be uninstalled.  But there are a few ASUS apps that must stay if you want the cool screen switching to work.THIS APP KILLS THE LAPTOP.  It's called ASUS Power 4 Gear and it controls the screens. The problem with it is it constantly fights windows.  An example is I used Power 4 gear to set my screen brightness and color temp on the inner display.  Then I needed the screen brighter so I did what anyone would do and used the brightness controls on the charms bar.  As soon as I changed it I lost all my backlights and color settings and they would not come back until I went into Power 4 gear and did it all over again.  The same thing happens when you close the lid and it switches to the outer display.  Non of your settings stay from the inner display.  This is a HUGE PAIN and ASUS should be ashamed of themselves for this software.  Honestly if this app was 'fixed' by ASUS this would be an good laptop, but right now this is the main thing that kills it.Another bad thing is the battery.  I used it for a few hours and you can literally watch the battery level drop, it's almost like it's animated it drops so fast.  My system came with a full charge and setting it up and a bit of HD youtube killed it in 2 and a half hours.  That is not acceptable in any way.One other gripe I have with it is the glass on the outer display.  It's great looking but it does not have a coating on it like a smartphone so fingerprints are EVERYWHERE and getting them off is not as easy as a wipe with your shirt.  You have to get a cloth and go to town on it if you are OCD like me.  I spent way too much time cleaning the damn lid on mine.In the end I returned this laptop and am getting a Surface pro.  I love the idea of the Taichi, but ASUS screwed up big time on the software and battery life.  Maybe next year there will be a Taichi 2 that fixes all these problems, I will be very interested to see that.", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving My Taichi", "Author": "consumergeek", "ReviewID": "R3IEXKBLBNPFC5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased the Taichi three weeks ago today and after reading some of the reviews I expected some problems. NOT the case at all.  I considered several Windows 8 convertibles  before deciding on the ASUS Taichi.  I am soooo pleased with my decision.  I absolutely love this device.  Other reviews have been very detailed about the performance so I won't rehash those details.  I will provide updates as I continue using the Taichi over the next few weeks.  I must say I am amazed at the some of the reviews on other sites about this product.  Did ASUS just give out bad review units or what?  I have been using an iPad for over two years now and was very skeptical about any tablet ever taking it's place. However, slowly but surely the Taichi is changing my mind and I expect within another week or so I wont' even be using my iPad.  Now that is saying a lot for me to make that change because I love my iPad and have not travelled with a laptop in two years.  The only reason I give the Taichi 4 stars is the battery life.  But I knew that before I purchased the Taichi.  As has been mentioned several times, there is not a perfect \"hybrid\" or \"convertible\" solution so you just have to weigh the pro and cons of each product.  And yes the 2.7 lbs is heavier than my iPad but I have adjusted and it doesn't bother me at all.  This is a great product that doesn't deserve some of the reviews it is receiving on some of the tech sites.  I would love to purchase a thin cover that would fit over the tablet screen that would eliminate the \"finger print magnet\" effect while carrying the Taichi out of its supplied carrying pouch.Update 3/22/13:  I have been using the Taichi now for a couple of months and I am still loving this ultrabook. I am starting to see more people using Windows 8 convertibles which is nice to see. I still believe the Taichi was the best choice for my needs. I just purchased the Asus Suit/Cover for the Taichi and it fits perfectly. However, I am not having the same good fortune finding a portable battery to purchase that will work on the Taichi, so if anyone knows of one please let me know.

Dual screen \"Taichi\" mode is still flakey even after reverting back to Windows 8.At this price one would expect better support from ASUS. Wish I would have waited for one pre-loaded with 8.1 (Have they done that?) After messing with this for several weeks I took it to a computer store to get it working again. (At my COST). It took the \"experts about 10 hours to get it \"somewhat\" working again. Love the machine but hate the company \"support\". (I use the term loosely). WiDi for my \"push to TV\" still does not work, \"Taichi button\" intermittently works,  screen brightness has a mind of it's own.Bottom line: ASUS needs to spend less time trying to sell me other products and more time coming up with a fix for a machine they promoted with a \"free upgrade to windows 8.1\". Doubt I will ever buy another product from them.Added 12/20/2013:One thing I meant to mention and forgot:For the life of me I don't understand how they (IMHO) blew it on the camera.

When completely folded, the Asus is beautiful, but upon opening you can see the aesthetics take a nosedive.  The front/main screen has a thick bezel that surrounds it and makes it look cheap.  I can now see that the stock pictures of the front don't go into too much detail.Even so, that still wasn't enough for me to send it back.  I fired it up and loaded some software and updates.  After three days I couldn't stand it.  The touchpad kept sensing movement when I wasn't even near it.  And I couldn't believe how frustrating it was to have a non-touchscreen as the main display.  It was my first Windows 8 machine and now I understand all the reviews that criticize non-touchscreen laptops with Windows 8.  They're terrible.  I think the Taichi had so much potential.  If it had a front/main screen that was touch I think it would have been my best laptop purchase.

A firmware update is really needed for this convertible to operate as advertised. Part of the problem is the implementation of Windows 8. This machine seems to sometimes fight for what it wants to do against Windows.  Things like the the lights constantly flickering as the brightness constantly adjusts, the touch pad scrolling working intermittently, the touch screen scrolling also working intermittently and so on.On the plus side, this convertible is light enough and the form factor is a joy to use. But use as a tablet is hampered by the touchscreen browser experience. You'll close the lid in frustration and resort to using it as an ultra book in all but mandatory drawing activities. Also, one of my biggest pet peeves is the super bright Windows button on the tablet side of the computer. Super annoying as you can't shut it off or dim the beam as it shines directly into your soul (and eye). I really hate that button and it keeps me from being able to comfortably enjoy reading (via the Kindle app)in tablet mode (one of my big reasons for buying this). It's also annoying when trying to watch a movie and you'll end up just opening the laptop up, turning off the keyboard light and using it that way (although there is still the mildly annoying wifi light that only turns off when you turn off wifi, which in turns turns off any streaming you're probably doing).Not going to go much more into Windows 8, but anything you don't like about it is probably present here. Having you swipe to get things done is one thing, but when that feature randomly stops working (happens a lot), it turns into another dance of frustration.  And don't get me started on the Windows Store or it's apps. Super half baked. The quality of the few apps are terrible and most times take away features of the normal (Windows 7)desktop programs. Trust me, skip most \"8\" versions and use the regular (Windows 7)programs instead. You're welcome.  A lot of programs still struggle to fight through the bloat that is Windows 8. Super small example, Skype won't ever go away unless you exit out of the program. It just sits in your toolbar refusing to go away. \"X\" means nothing.So to sum things up... If you're offered a really good deal on this and it's cheaper than a comparable ultra book, then go for it. A lot of the Windows 8 problems are going to be universal, so you're going to have to work around them if you want a new \"8\" laptop. The second screen is slick and the transition from laptop to tablet is really well done, so if you have business need for the second screen then go for it.

In terms of features/price, I think this one has them beat (if not just for the gorgeous dual full HD IPS screens and dual webcams, as well as wow factor).-Aesthetically, it seems similar to a Macbook Air, but has a slightly better build quality and better keyboard. The aluminum chassis does not feel like cheap dollar store pot metal and the hinge does not seem to be made from cheap plastic.-It only gets slightly warm on full load, and the fans barely ever make any noise whatsoever.-Audio quality is great, externally and internally. The speakers can get surprisingly loud.-Camera quality is about as good as the camera(s) on a modern smartphone.-Many people seem to be worried about damaging the outer screen, which is covered in Gorilla glass. I've bumped and nicked it a few times lightly on some surfaces, but there still isn't a scratch on it.-At first I thought using the device in tablet mode would be mostly pointless much like with my old TX2500. However, with Windows 8/Windows RT apps, I have found myself using this mode equally, if not more often than laptop mode.That being said, there are a few minor imperfections with it (like with any laptop).Hardware-This thing is a fingerprint magnet, both outside and inside. Luckily, it comes with not one, but two cleaning cloths for some reason.-Battery life is probably one of the larger flaws, though 4-4.5 hours of light to average use isn't awful for an i5 ultrabook. It usually charges from low batt. in around an hour or less, so I don't mind.-No, triple screen does not work, and I was not expecting it to work.Software-The Taichi Home software can be finicky at times, occasionally trying to figure out which mode it is currently in on wake and enabling the correct screen.-There isn't a WinTab driver out yet, so pressure sensitivity in Photoshop or Paint Tool Sai do not work. I've heard N-Trig is supposedly still working on this, though. ArtRage and OneNote detect pressure fine.-One of the things I miss the most is how customizable Synaptics touchpad drivers were. Don't get me wrong, the massive touchpad and Asus gestures work fine. I just miss tap zones and cursor momentum.-There also seemed to be a CPU throttling bug that was easily fixed by installing an updated touchpad driver.-Asus partitions quite a bit of the drive for recovery (20 GB image) leaving you a 93 GB partition (with the 128 GB SSD). Take that and the 20 GB Windows 8 installation, and you're left with about 60 something GB of user space. Personally, I just tacked on a tiny 64 GB flash drive and moved my static files there and left the SSD more open for programs.-Custom Asus software means a little more RAM usage than a vanilla install. Probably 100 MB give or take, but with soldered RAM, every byte counts.I've found this ultrabook convertible to be perfect for reading muh chinese girl comics and watching chinese girl cartoons.Overall, this laptop is well-built and worth exactly (if not more) what you pay for, as well as wonderfully fun and interesting to use.", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Learn from my mistake.", "Author": "User409", "ReviewID": "RLCEHEGQXZGB2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Upon writing this review I have had an Asus Taichi in my posession for around 3 months give or take a week or two. Now I purchased and received the laptop in AUGUST of last year, but this 2 pound $950 chunk of crap has been at the ASUS RMA center far longer than it has been with me.First and foremost the laptop on paper is a great machine, a reasonably powerful processor, enough ram for windows 8 to run, a 256 SSD, and the ability to be used as a tablet or a laptop at a whim.Too bad this was nothing more than a proof of concept model that should have NEVER been released to the public. Updated drivers break the device and seem to conflict with the laptops auto update program in a never ending struggle to have the worst possible driver for any given component. They advise you to upgrade to windows 8.1... too bad they forgot to update the drivers to work correctly with it and an upgrade results in nothing but your touch screen being disabled and your touchpad breaking as well(google taichi windows 8.1 black screen). Asus has done nothing but laugh at those unfortunate enough to purchase this device.As for the company selling the laptop (ASUS incase you forgot) I have never in my life dealt with a more shady, underhanded, deceitful company. I have been forced to interact with their so called \"taichi VIP support\"  around 30 times trying to get my issues resolved, and Ive been hung up on around 10 times. I am very patient on the phone too, so dont assume im being nasty. It really does seem like they are trained to just put you on hold for 30 min in hopes you'll get frustrated and hang up, and if you dont then they just hang up on you anyway. Somehow the first person you are connected to is always \"highest ranking manager on call\" which anyone with half a brain can tell is a flat out lie and a refusal to escalate your case.Across these 30 some odd calls my laptop was RMAed 4 times. Out of the box the laptop had crashing and overheating issues so I sent it for repair, it came back with a broken screen, so once again I RMAed it, now the screen worked but they somehow broke the SSD and windows could not even load (HOW they managed to send a dead laptop back from a repair center is a testament to the quality of ASUS), then finally on the fourth RMA they replaced my brand new $1.6k (at the time)ultrabook with a refurbished model with a 90 day warranty. They actually took away my purchase warranty and gave me a 90 day one... Not only that buy most of the people I spoke with would literally tell me anything I wanted to hear to get me to hang up the phone, around 7 different technicians told me I qualified for a replacement laptop of equal value made by ASUS, this turned out be a lie and they conveniently forgot to put in the notes they promised me a new computer. Their repair technicians are no better, during my last RMA I was directed to provide video and image proof of my issues to the repair tech working on my laptop before they would work on it (because clearly im a criminal who needs to prove these kinds of things). These technicians was just as deceitful as the rest of the support team as he tried to email me (from the same address we had spoke on) posing as someone else telling me he was the VP of repairs or something, when he deemed a new model replacement (I asked for a new taichi to make up for all the time lost and damage done to it from the repair center) not doable. Thus I end up with a beat Frankenstein laptop with no warranty.Now the referb has been working semi well for around a month (even though this one also has overheating issues [no laptop CPU should idle at 76 C, though asus assures me this is normal...]) and recently it started to bug out (same problems EVERYONE with this laptop comes across screen rotation, overheating...etc). So once again I picked up the phone and was connected with someone at the asus repair center, they took down my info put me on hold, then 25 minutes later hung up on me. I guess they win and I lose, they got my money and I have still not received a working laptop.Learn from my mistake. This is a terrible device that is absolutely riddled with flaws and broken features(for christ sake the updater program by default causes an infinite restarting loop and has since its release), and if you do make the mistake of buying an ASUS product you better be damn sure NOTHING goes wrong with it or you will find yourself dealing with people who will do nothing but lie to you to get you to hang up that phone.DO NOT buy this laptop, it was by far the most expensive mistake I have ever made and Ive found its impossible to sell, so you will be stuck with it till the power plug breaks (common issue) and bricks the device.", "Date": "February 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great idea - but falls short", "Author": "Pudge68", "ReviewID": "R3HGTZ3J5MQQ2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I love the concept - but for me, this hybrid has a lot of problems* the native resolution (1920x1080)makes thing VERY hard to see.

I believe it is one of the more interesting ones. But i couldnt give it a perfect score for a few reasons. First off let me just state I got the i5 version and i got it used for around $680 with shipping. Because it was used it came with a few minor issues such as barely noticable scratches and a hard to see light area on the touch screen. but i'm ignoring these issues when writing this review.This is a very capable machine with a fairly sturdy and solid feel. Ive managed to game on it (eve online), use virtual machines on it, transfer large files etc. and it seems to have the power to do all of these without any problems. It is a great all around machine. And looks nice too. I love the size and weight, design is awesome.The reason its a 3 star product instead of a 4 or 5 star one is simple: in my experience its kind of buggy. Annoyingly so sometimes. I could be in laptop mode with the touchscreen completly off and out of no where its like a ghost is using the touch screen. Moving stuff around, closing windows etc. its difficult to fix without just turning the power off.I have a windows 8.1 pro dvd and yes i reinstalled several times and made sure to download any drivers it needed. It may be i missed a few drivers ( i hope) but this is a serious problem to me. Another issue i have from time to time is the trackpad stops recognizing gestures.

(apple and android are not options, i'm not into art and, i have to actually use it productively) (and lenovo is known for bugging their computers, sorry china not interested)Assumptions:Price range: 500-900screen size: 10.6 is too small for a laptop... 13.3+ is slightly too big for a tablet.

There are scads of professional reviews online that provide some good information. However, it's worth repeating that one must first decide what the point of having two screens that you can't see at the same time is. For me, I wanted to try something just as goofy as Windows 8.The out-of-box experience was pretty bad. Mine crashed several times and was then followed by 8-10 reboots. The first for Windows Update, and the rest for ASUS Live Update. That being said, I am glad it was updating itself. The accelerometer didn't work at all, then behaved erratically, then finally started working. Mysteriously, the screen will sometimes flip upside down without being moved at all.The hard drive came in two partitions, one 95.3 GB for the OS and the remaining 117 GB for DATA. Makes no sense to me, but it was easy enough to delete the DATA volume and then extend the OS drive with the available space - something I recommend doing right away.The second display runs in standard Windows dual-monitor mode. This makes \"Extended Display\" quite useless in most scenarios. Unless you want to do something that requires no cursor or keyboard actions (such as watch a movie, or, umm, let the person sitting behind you watch a movie) then you'll be constantly battling for control. Think of a single workstation with two monitors, two keyboards, two mice, and two people trying to do something and you'll get the idea. That being said, it could easily handle watching a compressed 1080p movie on one screen and Angry Birds Star Wars on the other without dropping a frame.A final negative thought is how difficult reinstalling Windows will be. I think it would have been simple enough to include a $10 \"Reinstall/Recovery\" USB stick with a $1600 unit. When the day comes to format this bad boy it's going to be a battle royale. Just looking at the ASUS driver web site (which was down most of the day) makes me cringe.There are some things I like about it. Another reviewer mentioned the fact that one screen gets all gummed with finger-prints and the other stays nice and clean, I agree wholeheartedly. My overall impression of Windows 8 on a touchscreen (and this isn't my first) is that it's really great for goofing off with things like paint or games, but you're not going to get any serious work done with it.In the end, it's like a mullet: Business in the front, party in the back! (but not at the same time)UPDATE 01-22-2013: The last round of Windows updates turned my screen rotation off again. It was easy enough to fix, from \"tablet\" mode you need to go to the screen resolution control panel and turn it back on. I think the way the ASUS software interacts with Windows 8 is the most annoying part of this laptop. The help of \"Taichi VIP support\" is laughable, which means this could be a real lemon for a basic user.

The other keys are not doing very-well either (I will later explain how I know that they are not in good shape later)2. Awful warranty. ASUS claims! that the product is covered with an international warranty. This is my story: after my broken key, I immediately contacted ASUS in my home country (Turkey). After 1 hour wait time, I was told that it was user-caused and not covered within the warranty. They also said that there is no spare key (letter T), and I need to replace the whole keyboard/case. As this is a unibody laptop, it would cost me around $170. I was very upset.I contacted ASUS US. I was told that there is nothing that they can do about it, except they asked me to pay another visit or ship it overseas. The customer center repeatedly emphasized that this is user-fault. I was frustrated.Luckily I was able to find some 2nd hand keyboard online and had my key replaced at a local store. (being absolutely sure that it will void the warranty, and they would have charged me another $100 just to put it in at the ASUS center). After $90 and 2-3 hours of work,1 month of waiting/finding a spare key, and a ton of frustration I now have my key.2. Ridiculous battery life. I mean just ridiculous. No need for elaboration.3.

I had been waiting for the non-existent Samsung Sliding PC7, but it never came, I bought the Sony Duo (another sliding form-factor touchscreen) because I was worried that the ASUS would never come (delayed since Oct 2012), but had to return it because of some of the issues it had (see long review at its product page). So now I own the Taichi i7.Pros:Fast, it's an i7 so it better be.Solid, it feels solid despite being the lightest computer I have ever owned.Two LCD screens, which means that there is no elaborate twisting or sliding mechanism to give me both a laptop and a touchpad.  Now I have the best of both worlds without the \"prone-to-failure\" alternate methods for using one screen in both orientations.Two fast USB 3 ports (not new, but I'm coming from an Atom based old machine so it's fast from my point of view).Hinge is solid and tight at any angle.The screens are HD and the inner one is matte.It comes packaged nicely in a nice box and it made it across 3 continents unbroken.I had no problems out of the box with the dual screen setup with switching between laptop and tablet mode.  I did use the little blue key at first to switch between the two modes, until I realized that simply closing the screen (with the left-side screen lock button in the non-red mode) would switch to tablet mode, and opening it again would switch it back to desktop mode.  (I use the power button for sleep now)It has two cameras, one forward facing and one facing out.The sound is great for such a small laptop.The keyboard is backlit (and brightness is adjustable from keyboard hotkeys).The multi-touchscreen works well, and the included pen works even better.The BIOS has the ability to turn off UEFI protected mode and turn on CSM mode. (for loading other non EFI operating systems like Linux or others).The install of Windows 8 still works even after the protected mode is turned off in the BIOS (the Windows 8 install on the Sony Duo did NOT do this and refused to work in any capacity until UEFI protected mode was turned back on).  So huge plus there for people that want to dual boot (or triple boot) to non-EFI compliant OS'es (the big Linux distros support EFI now, but not the smaller ones).This thing actually can support 3 monitors (with the included video dongle).You can use third party apps to give back some functionality to Windows 8 (Start Clasic, and SearchFX).The 256gb SSD is big and fast.The power-plug seems pretty smooth (it rotates smoothly).  Hopefully it lasts a while.It's all metal and glass and looks nice.It comes with a nice cover/sleeve (not fit to drop it in, but free)Cons:  (most of these cons are related the Windows 8 Home edition that comes on it)It's so light that I worry I'm going to drop it.  (I wish manufactures would design in some areas on the back to grip tablets and ultrabooks better.)It's a fingerprint magnet. (Although my hands could stand to be cleaner I guess)There is no place to store the included pen.It has Windows 8 Home and the upgrade to Pro is $200 from Microsoft ($39 for everyone but people running Win8 Home already, so basically not for anyone buying a new computer).Windows 8 Home doesn't like to let programs access Linux-based SMB mapped drives correctly (oh you can hack the registry to make them work correctly, normally you could use gpedit.msc, but Microsoft removed it from Home versions, so you'll be manually fixing registry entries related to NTLM2 and policies instead).Windows 8 Home doesn't have Hyper-V installed (needs Pro now), so forget about running XP mode or an XP emulation without using a third party program (or paying $200 to Microsoft for Pro).There is no restore DVD or USB drive, and it's a Home version of Windows that doesn't let you properly make one from the software included in Windows.  There is also no ASUS program to make one.  I had to boot into Linux and \"dd\"ed a copy of the SSD to a large NTFS formated USB memory stick (the image was a 25gb .gz file, hence the need for a NTFS filesystem).Windows 8 has no way of modifying the priority or deleting stored WiFi connections (short of manually updating the contents of a system .xml file).  So you better hope the order it puts them in is the way you want it. (You can find a quirky 3rd party program that modifies the .xml for you).When you uninstall the included Mcafee, it leaves 5 running programs installed. (I guess uninstall means something different nowadays).The SSD comes with multiple partitions installed (2 EFI, 1 restore, 1 recovery, 1 system boot, 1 for C:, 1 for D: (user data).  This seems excessive, and after installing Linux I now have 10 partitions.There is no start bar (no surprise it is Windows 8), but it is a con.  I tried to use it as is (Windows 8 that is), but I can't, and I advise that if you have high blood pressure that you should have a few drinks prior to using Windows 8 for anything other than clicking on the internet or Facebook, as the risk of stroke increases proportionally with the amount of time you spend trying to use your Windows 8 install for real work.The product key is stored in the bios and you can't see or change it, which means that you can not simply buy Windows 8 Pro and install it clean (it will find and use the Home one stored in the bios), so you have to upgrade, but you can't with a full version key.Mint Linux 14 Xfce installs and works ok (my guess is that all Ubuntu based distros will be the same), all the hardware seems to work except the touch screen and the clickpad mouse, the mouse works, but the nature of a clicking touchpad is different than a normal touchpad and without special software to stabilize the bottom of the touchpad (where the button is under) it is hard to click on small things without the mouse jumping about while pressing down.  ASUS could release some support files for Linux related to the clickpad and touchscreen that would make the experience better for us Linux users. Right now the coolness and useability of the second screen goes away on anything except Windows 8.There is no Pause/Break keyboard key. (this seems to be a trend with most manufactures nowadays)Final:In the end I had to install a lot of 3rd party apps to be able to do the same things I was doing under XP. (Start Clasic, SearchFX, WiFi-Profile-Editor) and then tweak those apps settings.  This has nothing to do with this machine's hardware, but seeing as how it does come with Windows 8, it does belong in its review.  Any machine I would have bought new would have had most of those cons (excluding the ability to make a ASUS Restore USB, I blame ASUS for that failing).I am happy I bought the Taichi, I wish ASUS gave the end user some more operating system choices by releasing drivers for Linux, Windows 7, and since I'm dreaming, Windows XP 64-bit.  The hardware is great from the speakers to the screens, the EFI options in the BIOS will make me look to ASUS for my next laptop purchase (I love choices).  The only real problem with this device is that is comes with Windows 8, but it is up to Microsoft to fix its problems not ASUS.Microsoft Rant:Truth is I would have paid an extra $200 if I could have purchased this with XP on it from the factory and had the same touchscreen and second screen functionality as on Windows 8.  I really truly hate Windows 8, much more than I hated Windows 7.  Windows 8 has all the same problems Windows 7 had with its GUI (once in desktop mode), and then they managed to break everything else with the Modern/Metro interface.  This is a computer, not an XBOX, and I'm not 15.  Microsoft needs to realize that most 15 year old kids may think this interface is great, but they are not the ones with the money, nor do they make the software that makes the world work, so stop making \"cool\" interfaces and give me back my efficiency.  There is no universe where clicking in a corner, then clicking a magnifying glass, then typing the name of the program I want to run (providing I even know the name), and then clicking on it, is faster than simply clicking an icon in a menu.  Just give me back my Start-menu, File Explorer, Control Panel, and Wifi Manager from XP, at least as a choice.  Fin.UPDATE:  March 5, 2013I still like it, but really hated Windows 8, so after an UEFI/CSM issue, I erased all the partitions, converted the SSD to an MBR from a GPT using a PE (wow that's a lot of acronyms), and then created three 20gb partitions (2 NTFS, 1 EX4) and a put the rest as a big NTFS drive label \"DATA\".  I used my Technet ISO of Windows 8, converted it to a bootable USB install, upon booting it picked up the product key embedded in the BIOS and I installed on the first partition.  I then tried using my backup of the eSystem (ASUS driver folder on original HD) to reload the now missing drivers and Apps, but it glitched and wouldn't install past a certain point, so I just went to ASUS's website and downloaded all the updated drivers from there (for Windows 8).  After installing the downloaded drivers, a few updates, and a few reboots, everything was back to stock (mostly, and minus some factory crapware), both the screen and touch mouse would switch the way they are supposed to.  I then proceed to install Mint Linux XFCE 14, it went in perfectly and grub2 listed both Linux and Win8, and both would boot great.  I then installed Windows XP 64 SP2, after slip-streaming the AHCI and chipset TXTMODE driver into the install disk with nLite )and removed all the unnecessary Windows crap and services).  The creating of the XP disk took 3 tries to get the right version of the AHCI real-mode and TXTmode drivers installed, but afterwards it installed quickly (albeit in 640x480 resolution).  Finding the XP-64 drivers on ASUS's website wasn't going to happen, but I found the Intel HD-4000, Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 (Wifi), Bluetooth, 7 Series Chipset, and AHCI SATA drivers on Intel's website, and that got me pretty far. It's still a work in progress to find all the drivers but I think it's possible.  I should also note that Windows XP took control of the booting and only would boot itself, and because it wasn't installed on \"C:\" it took moving XP boot files, repairing Windows 8, and re-installing Grub2 and some manual grub config file creations to get it back to using Grub2 to select between the 3 operating system choices, but it is possible.  I almost have what I wanted, a Windows XP replacement for my old Sony that can also be used as a tablet.UPDATE:  Sept 5, 2013I still like it, the battery is lasting a little less, but the hinge has given up the ghost.  It will hold near the end of travel in either direction but not in a position that is at the \"normal viewing angle\", it just drops back a bit.  I can't really tell if the hinge is loose inside or if the spring is worn out.  I'll have to try contacting Asus to see what they want me to do.", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "not in proper working condition", "Author": "Chihuahua", "ReviewID": "R12S8OOK2U91GS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Though the laptop software functioned according to my standards and to the claimed specifications, the hardware did not work so well.

WHAT MADE ME CHOOSE ASUS! Was their Support sales pitch the same one they are using today and I bought into it in a big way I mean just read their promo on this VIP support and year of ADP added in with a special dedicated support line just for Tiachi users this all still sounds good as I\u2019m typing this out eight months later. Now here\u2019s some truth The very things that made this look like a great deal are FALSE ADVERTISING what they don\u2019t show on slick Asus designed sales page is <THE ACCEDENTAL DAMAGE PLAN IS A SINGLE USE PLAN>!! I challenge you to find that on this sales page on Amazon. Now about that VIP support they do send you a little card with the unit with a support number another great empty feeling of security, they do answer the phone fairly quick and speak English they won\u2019t do much but they will tell you that in a language you understand, so there\u2019s that. They also make a big deal, when selling you this line about their VIP support that if you have a problem Asus will use a next business day currier and they will come pickup and then fix or replace and return to your door a working computer and hey this all sounds great hell it made me spend like 1,000 on this 8 months ago except when I tried all this alleged service it didn\u2019t work out so well.let me describe what happened to my computer I keep it next to my recliner sitting on a TV tray plugged in, And in like February this year I was running the vacuum and must have bumped it or something and it fell on the tray then hit the carpet all from a height of let\u2019s say 2.5 ft. at most , well things happen I checked it out all seamed well and went on with life. About 2 weeks later I woke up to find my computer off, this was alarming but I started trying to get it to start, no luck so I thought back to that fall and reached for my special VIP Tiachi support card and called them up from here on it\u2019s a sad story, there wasn\u2019t much trouble shooting to be done since it was not turning on but I have the VIP support so I\u2019m expecting that door to door thing to kick in, well my VIP support tech is telling me that\u2019s not the case and I would need to box it up and send the thing back and forget door to door He is telling I will need to pay the shipping to a depot and expect 2 weeks before I hear anything, now this is not sounding VIP or anything close to what made me buy this special unit, so I ask for a supervisor thinking this support guy just doesn\u2019t know the whole VIP deal while waiting I bring up the amazon page on my phone just to be sure I am not insane and no it still says door to door VIP special support and a year of ADP, about this time the supervisor comes on and says the same thing the underling said send it back at your cost, so I explain the reason I bought the Tiachi and that I wasn\u2019t feeling the VIP love and I literally had to send him to Asus\u2019s own page telling me all of what I\u2019m saying is exactly what\u2019s on their support page, so during the long wait I looked at the ADP page not for this unit but another and it says it\u2019s A SINGLE USE PLAN !! this is confirmed to me by the supervisor by this point I am a little upset but I had remembered that it was plugged in when it took it giant leap of 2 feet on to the carpet and sure enough the light was off on the power supply I explained this and asked for a new supply and that this not be used as my one use ADP I was newly made aware I had been hosed into, that was also a big negative he then came up with he would send me a rma and again in up to 2 weeks I could find out if it was the supply but should they find it was the power and not the fall I would be charged for the new supply and the shipping both ways I asked for names and declined. I ordered a supply from amazon and that was the issue. I then opened a BBB complaint against Asus and after 3 months of back and forth their position has not changed this can all be seen on BBB.org I was also told I wasn\u2019t to publicly recite their response when I said I would yell this to anyone who would listen and didn\u2019t agree to any non-disclosure Asus cut off commutation. So if anyone has read all this keep shopping or at least know that Asus actively engages in DECIPTIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES and FALSE ADVERTISING yet here the same units are being sold by Amazon using the lies that made me sorry I ever heard the name Taichi. Again this is all public record on [...] along with the other thousands of complaints, how Amazon can let this go on I really don\u2019t know..The style of the Taichi line is very good it defiantly has made people ask who makes your laptop- So it does look goodAs for the  functionality there are some drawbacks after 8 months of use some are glaring some are just annoying  from a function standpoint one of the main reasons I went with Asus over the other hybrid convertible ultrabooks was the stylus it was important to me I use one note a lot and also use a stylus to draw diagrams for my work. I had been using the Asus Ep121 slate it had its issues but overall performed well when it worked but that used a Wacom stylus and that is leaps and bounds above this- First it takes a AAAA battery but that\u2019s ok if it worked well, but it does not half the time it won\u2019t engage and when it does it\u2019s hardly accurate ,but once you get used to its flaws you can make it do what needs done, just plan on erasing a lot and starting over. Now on to the screen\u2019s you can watch a movie or you tube ect on the touch side it\u2019s a nice clear picture of course with only 4 gigs of ram and a underpowered processor along with the integrated Intel video card you get pretty much what you would expect, and for the inner side screen in laptop mode it\u2019s just plain bad it has some kind of coating on it that makes everything look almost milky it\u2019s good for word-processing and other business apps in fact it\u2019s the only way you can use most apps, even with apps that have touch support they don\u2019t work right with Taichi\u2019s touch so get used to laptop mode for work but you will also have to get an external mouse the touchpad on this thing will drive you insane they tried to make the touchpad like it was a touchscreen and it didn\u2019t work out pinch and zoom and Asus\u2019s own shortcut\u2019s via touchpad are enough to make you want a refund but you can tweak it and get some use but hey no big deal most laptop touch\u2019s suck. The last point on function I will talk about is power and battery and this was another selling point for me seeing the Centrino name again gave me high hopes but it was not to be you can expect 2 hours of outside on a nice day work time just sit in the shade because you will have a lot of glare or dark issues on either screen.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Beautiful piece of crap", "Author": "Mike Akrish", "ReviewID": "R3N8U37UEHPAH2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The most beautiful laptop I have had but It hardly works.
