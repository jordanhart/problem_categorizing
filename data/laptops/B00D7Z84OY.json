{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Notebook to Envy", "Author": "Tyler Sloan", "ReviewID": "R1MZF22MJUJHES", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Envy 15t-j000 is a high end laptop made by Hewlett-Packard that offers fast processing power with a 2.4 GHz Intel Core I7, and with the upgraded graphics option, can handle almost any game on the market.  This machine is a good alternative for gamers looking to have a more portable option than a desktop computer or a heavy gaming laptop.  After owning this computer for three months I have encountered very few problems with the machine.  The overall build quality seems very solid and reliable, something I would expect from an $800 computer.  The one terabyte hard drive is more than enough memory for the average user and the excess hard drive space means that very little management of the hard drive is required, as most users will not fill the one terabyte hard drive in the life of the computer.  I have only used 170 gigabytes of the 905 gigabytes of available storage and have installed most of the programs that I need or enjoy using.  I have never been a fan of touchpads, however the touchpad on the Envy 15t-j000 had surprisingly smooth motion on the screen and quite responsive.  While this computer runs very quickly and provides the performance I required while remaining portable, I do have a few issues with the device.  The most aggravating thing about the machine is the lack of an optical drive.  When purchasing the computed I did not even think to check if it came with one because it seemed like it should be standard, however this laptop does not include one.  This is easily remedied by purchasing and external CD-ROM drive, however it is an inconvenience especially when taking the computer places.  The lack of the option to downgrade to Windows 7 was disappointing however Hewlett-Packard did a good job with integrating their own start menu when in desktop mode, a feature windows 8 lacks.  This allows you to use Windows 8 just like Windows 7 which makes up for the lack of the optional downgrade.  Overall, the performance, build quality, and large hard drive make this computer a good and reliable purchase that I would recommend to users looking for performance on the go.  I have been very pleased with the computer so far and look forward to discovering what else the machine has to offer.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Jumpy touchpad ruins otherwise nice laptop", "Author": "M. Levine", "ReviewID": "RTICZP0SJM28Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I  bought an HP Envy 15t (no touch screen, 4th gen i7 processor) direct from HP and I love it. The sales rep helped me make good choices to keep the cost down while giving me a perfectly usable PC. However, I was so unhappy with a small dopey feature that I was ready to send it back. The feature was the \"touchpad\" - that indented rectangle below the keyboard that is supposed to replace a mouse. It was so very horrible that it was ruining my life - that stupid indented rectangle. What the hell? Don't designers actually use these PCs or do they all use Macs? With the help of customer support, I enabled a hidden amazingly fantastic feature: now when I plug in a USB mouse, the whole damn touchpad turns into a cup holder. When I unplug the mouse, the touchpad comes back to life as a total piece of dogdoo.Funny how a problem in a small component can render an otherwise wonderful PC almost useless. The problem, you wonder? I was forever unintentionally brushing the touchpad with the balls of my hands as I typed. At least that's what I suspect the problem to be.  I never felt myself doing it but the cursor was always jumping around the page. With the touchpad disabled, I can now type complete sentences without checking to make sure that the cursor is still in place.I would rate the HP Envy 15t a 1 of 5 with the touchpad enabled and a 4 of 5 with a mouse and disabled touchpad. If you buy it, invest a few bucks in a nice mouse.", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "great laptop.", "Author": "kevin45", "ReviewID": "R348GEJ69TU2FX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is probably the cheapest and best i7 processor laptop out there at the moment. here are a few things i noticed right out of the box and things i immediately checked for after reading reviews on here.1. the mouse pad is huge and will definitely require you to adjust your typing stance.

Note that this version of the laptop is not the Touchscreen edition, which makes Windows 8 more of a headache to use.  However, since I typically use my notebook attached to a monitor at my desk when I am not traveling with it, the touchscreen would not have been much help for me.  Note also that it does not have a built-in DVD drive.The version of the laptop advertised here is configured with some options missing that I would recommend: an mSATA caching SSD, a higher-resolution 1920x1080 display, and a 1 SODIMM 8Gb configuration (to make upgrading to 12Gb or 16Gb less expensive in the future, though these amounts of RAM aren't typically needed today).  The available NVidia 740M GPU is a step up from the integrated graphics, but not powerful enough for serious gaming.  The RAM and SSD can easily be added after-market.This laptop is about average in terms of dimensions for a modern laptop.  The strategic use of both aluminum and black plastic on the bottom make it look thinner than it really is. The materials feel solid.  Temperature and fan noise have not been an issue for me, as they can be with some thin and / or high-powered laptops.  It is slightly heavier than the 15.6\" i5-based Samsung laptop from 2010 that it is replacing.  However, the biggest drawback in terms of mobility is the 120W power adapter.  I was surprised and disappointed that a laptop based on a mobile processor and chipset would require this larger power brick---the average laptop gets by with a 90W adapter, which is much easier to find in a smaller, cheaper, and lighter package than the original HP unit.Overall, I am happy with the performance, build quality, and price of the unit.  With the 120W power adapter and its relative heftiness, the laptop is slightly less mobile than I was hoping for -- especially given the lack of a built-in DVD drive, which is the type of compromise found usually on more portable laptops.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic laptop!", "Author": "Matthew Doyle", "ReviewID": "R1GRDLN8IUJY78", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had many laptops over the years, but this is by far the best. It's fast, has a ton of memory, lots of hard drive space, and is a good price.There are only two negative aspects to this laptop.1) The touch pad is terrible. Again, I've had a lot of laptops over the years, but this touch pad is clearly the worst. This is my first HP, but I've had Dell, Samsung, Toshiba, and other brands...all have had better touch pads than this. I think part of the problem may be the design. The touch pad is very large, which can cause part of the palm of my hand to rest on it at times. Second, the touch pad is all one piece, rather than have two separate buttons at the bottom to click on. That could cause some issues too. But, whatever the reason, this touch pad is the worst thing about the laptop. If the rest of the laptop wasn't top notch I would have sent this back.2) Windows 8 sucks. This isn't the fault of HP, but it's still annoying. I downloaded google chrome and Classic Shell, which makes my desktop look similar to good ol' windows 7. It's not perfect, but it helps a lot. I rarely even go into the start screen/metro crap. Using Classic Shell, most people can't even tell that I'm not using Windows 7. So, if you download some stuff here and tweak some stuff there, you can turn windows 8 into something halfway mediocre. Using Windows 8 as it is designed is really not even an option. It's just that bad. I'd rather use windows 95 than windows 8.Some other things of note:1) The beats audio is really good. The speakers take up a significant part of the laptop and the sound is very good.2) The Number Lock button doesn't have a light on it to tell me that it's on. That's annoying and odd. Most computers have that.3) The finger print reader works well.4) Videos look average on it. Nothing bad, but nothing amazing either.5) Stays very cool, even after sitting on my bed and being used for hours.", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very fast and responsive laptop", "Author": "ASL", "ReviewID": "R2S6P5JPNQQWXO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from sams club not amazon.The intel core i7 chip inside of it is one of intel's fastest processors and it blows away everyday tasks on the computer. The computer stays cooler than any laptop I have ever owned probably due to the new intel chips using less power therefore creating less heat.Of course, HP does put some bloatware on the laptop like Norton (the anti-virus virus) and some other stuff but just google a program called \"CCleaner\" for free and run a registry cleanup (which I run weekly to maintain the computers performance) a few times to fix problems the computer may have. Also you can un-install the programs on the laptop that you do not want using CCleaner. And, If you need a really good antivirus software for free, I recommend something called Malwarebytes.So overall, this laptop is very fast and runs cool and has a good battery life. Windows 8 is kind of akward to use at first but it is not very difficult to adapt to it and it seems to run even faster than windows 7.

Ho", "ReviewID": "R35WFDZ7TV0LOD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will do this in bullet points to make it as brief and linear as Possible:1.  Noticed Broken Screw Bottom right side.2.  Hour on Chat Session with someone sending me screw kit.3.  Further examined computer, hinge was loose inside chassis (5 month Old Computer, never dropped and handled delicately)4.  Hour and Half explaining that I need warranty service but customer service rep kept confusing the screw kit with a warranty repair box for computer.5.  After the hour and a half insistence that I need warranty repair, he generated Box to be shipped with THE WRONG NAME AND ADDRESS!!!6.  Chat Session again for 45 minutes to cancel previous RMA and generate new shipment with correct Name and Address.7.  Two days later, box arrived.  Return sent very next day.10.  10 Days later after generating initial warranty repair and service Computer Comes back with a Different Lower Chassis (as there were component stickers on original machine) but same lid...WITH A COMPLETE SYSTEM RESET and RESTORE!!!They completely wiped all my files and system for a HINGE REPAIR!!!  Not only that, there are gouges in the Mouse pad from a Screwdriver or something.  Yes, there is always the possibility that they will do such a thing during warranty repair.  And I understand if your system is really screwed up...but really, a hinge repair?  Was that necessary?Now, I've been friendly and understanding the entire way through but still, service the entire way through has been Lackadaisical and Apathetic compared to my experience with DELL and other manufactures.Now it will take me a great deal of time to restore and set up my computer close to what it was.Yes, the computer has a great processor that you could only find in an comparable ASUS.  But the screen has marginal definition and is hard to see at specific angles.  Also, the screen will only about a 116 degrees.  Not very functional, especially for a touch screen.Update:Update with tech support. So far senior tech support cannot derive a way to restore my System Image from my a back up because of a system glitch nor able to restore a back up from another set of files from done on \"File Back Up\".I wanted the entire system restore from image, but I'm not sure how that is going to happen.  Therefore, all my backup may have been lost even though I've done my due diligence with System Image and File Backup before sending off my computer.Not sure of what the solutions will be at this point.  I'm professionally devastated from this loss of data and time I've devoted to it and will have to.YET ANOTHER REVISION TO THIS FIASCO:  5/27/2014After spending over a week restoring my computer after doing some research on how to access a Windows Image via Disk Management (which is not the way Windows Back up or Image Restore is supposed to work), I noticed a blemish in the screen I thought was dirt. So preoccupied with restoring it to it's working condition, I didn't try to clean or inspect the mark.  It is indeed a defective screen.  HP replaced my entire computer, save the top lid, with a salvaged scratched up computer when it went to Indiana for Warranty Repair. I was going to live with the scratches on the touchpad, but this is unacceptable.  I know it can't be something that happened from my side because the abrasion, separation or scratch is on the interior of the glass.  Perhaps where the protective glass meets the LCD.  It's not an exterior scratch. Been trying to get some resolution but have yet to hear from case manager. Will report their solution and resolution.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent All-Around Notebook", "Author": "Archon", "ReviewID": "R2VCO5ZSUZ71TT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this notebook from HP, the one change from the Amazon model being I paid an extra $30 for the backlit keyboard. After spending a week with this notebook, I have to say, this is the best computer I have ever owned...hands down.Let's get the design and build quality of the notebook out of the way first. Yes, HP essentially ripped off the MacBook Pro...do I care? No. The Envy is made entirely out of plastic, which is fine honestly. The plastic is durable, and I have virtually no complaints with the build quality of this laptop. The only issue I have had, a minor one to say the least, is that on one side of the display, the frame seems to have the tiniest amount of flex. Besides that, everything is excellent. I was a little worried about the keyboard, as I had seen a video on youtube during my research of a user complaining about keyboard flex. I am glad to say this is absolutely not an issue for me. This is the nicest keyboard I've used on a laptop thus far.In terms of performance, you are getting a fair amount of bang for your buck. 8gb of RAM and a 4th generation i7 will handle everything except hardcore gaming and video editing. A word on graphical performance...My version of this laptop comes with the Intel chipset, which is notoriously inferior to having a dedicated graphics card. For those not especially computer hardware savy, when the computer must display graphics, it has to perform a number of intense calculations very quickly. High end computers will have external graphics cards to take the load off the CPU by doing these calculations themselves. This dramatically speeds up graphically intensive tasks. The Intel chipset is generally inferior as it doesn't have its own processor (like a graphics card) but instead burdens the CPU with these calculations. Luckily, Intel has upgraded their chipset architecture in recent years, meaning that the current generation of Intel Mobile graphics (what is inside the standard Envy) produces performance COMPARABLE to current low-end Nvidia/ATI graphics cards. I was surprised to find anti-aliasing was now supported, a huge step up over past generations.Ultimately, it would help to upgrade the graphics card if you plan on playing higher end games at reasonable quality. If you want to play ultra-high end games like the Crysis series, that is out of the question obviously, look elsewhere. Otherwise, the default build of this laptop is MORE than capable of handling most games and virtually all tasks.Software wise, beyond some of the normal crapware (par for the course these days), everything runs smoothly. I had no issues setting up Windows 8.1 as some other reviewers did. The fingerprint reader and its accompanying software is somewhat gimmicky, but I can see it being useful. The webcam is subpar, you will not be having HD skype chats with this thing, but it gets the job done, and has a nice status light to tell you when it's on or off.The only bad thing about this laptop is the poor screen resolution. It is not full hd, and is only 1366x768 . I feel this was a bizarre choice on HP's part. If you look carefully on high quality content, you will notice some pixelation and sharp edges. In games, this is somewhat mitigated by the anti-aliasing I mentioned earlier. But on very high quality youtube videos etc. you will probably notice it. I can live with this display considering the price I am paying. Overall, the laptop is a steal, and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the laptop; Hate the charger", "Author": "Writerwanabe \"charleytangofoxtrot\"", "ReviewID": "R274HDMDB44VOW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop directly from HP. This is not the touch screen model. However, the main function, for me, of a touch screen is being able to make the image larger on the screen for my 64 year old eyes. That functionality is built into the mouse pad.I wanted a high performance laptop that could double as a main computer. This machine does that well. I got several speed oriented upgrades from HP including an nvidia graphics card, hybrid hard disk, and the newer 802.11 AC wi-fi card. I also ordered the hi-def display (1920 x1080). I wanted a laptop that would be up-to-speed for several years. The price was a bit more than the one listed here but I think the upgrades are worth it.I can not say if this laptop, even with the upgrades, is suitable for avid gamers. I don't do games.The machine boots very fast, less than 25 seconds. Apps load quickly. The hi-def screen is stunning. The speakers and audio are also the best I have heard.The 15.6 inch screen is a perfect compromise between portability and eye-strain. Weight is about 6 pounds but I think the battery may add half a pound.Windows 8 is weird at first but not that hard to get used to. There is a screen that you can switch to whenever you want that looks very much like the Windows 7 desktop. There is also a search function accessible from the top right corner of the screen that will allow you to type in anything (e.g. screen brightness) and go right to that function.So far, all software that I used on Windows 7 works under Windows 8. This includes Office 2007 and Quicken 2010.My only beef is the charger. This is a higher end notebook that is meant to be portable. Yet HP supplies a clunky, heavy charger.(5.5 x 3 x 1 inches) that adds bulk and weight. So, the first thing you may have to do is shop for a travel charger or slim charger.I am happy with the laptop (despite the charger).", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "What can I say, it's a HP", "Author": "donput", "ReviewID": "R3LREB4CB1B0FP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had HP's before and I thought I had learned my lesson but obviously not.

With the i7 processor and 8gb ram, you can do a lot of work at once without lagging. Windows 8 seems a little hard to use, and the apps on it are not very good to use but it's fine with nice interface. The intel hd graphics 4k6 also provides good gaming. You can play most medium games on it (personally, I just play dota 2 and it works fine with nearly perfect settings). The only inconvenient so far is the keyboard is not very well responsed. It good enough to type but sometimes, when you type in the corner of a button, it doesn't work, but mostly, you will be fine. And 1 more thing that there is no numlock light, so you can't tell if numlock is on or off unless you try to type. Also, the display angle is quite small, if you don't look straight to the screen, the color will chage a bit and it's hard to see, but as long as you look straight to it, you will be fine. I think that the screen is lack of color, too, but it's okay.Personally, I will definitely recommend this computer because it is good for the price, and you can do most things with it, from everyday task to medium gaming.
