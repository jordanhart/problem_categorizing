{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pretty good laptop", "Author": "mysticdroid", "ReviewID": "R3VP1DDDAUMRT0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this directly from Lenovo as a refurbished item through their outlet website about 3 months ago. I was able to get it for a decent price and it didn't have any signs of previous use. I'm posting this here because I figure it would have a much broader audience than other places.Build Quality:I'm very impressed with the build quality. The keyboard is the standard apple/sony chiclet style. It's solid and the keys have a good amount of travel. It would be nice if it was back-lit, but I'm not surprised it's missing at this price point. The screen hinge is solid yet moves easily. The screen doesn't wobble when you're using and stays where you set it to. Overall the chassis is solid also. It doesn't flex or feel cheap when you need to pick it up or carry it around. The palm rest and keyboard surround have a nice finish that keeps smudges from being an annoyance. I haven't noticed any hotspots, though I don't do alot of intense gaming or video. The fan is generally quiet even when going at full blast. The exhaust is on the left side and can be kinda warm. If it's cold it can keep your hand toasty:) For the current round of i5 laptops the weight is average or less. Overall, I would say this is an extremely well built laptop. Lenovo knows how to put together a solid reliable machine.input/output Quality (screen, speakers, touchpad, etc.):The screen is a slight gripe, but not a deal breaker. The resolution is standard at 1366x768. The screen is bright and doesn't seem to have any major color reproduction issues as long as you're looking at it straight on. The viewing angles are kinda horrible. If you want to watch a movie with someone you have to have it far away for 2 people to fit in the sweet spot.One thing that is actually horrible are the speakers. You have to keep the sound low if you don't want to hear any distortion. I've tried using them, but have given up. Really though it's not that big of a deal. When I'm at home, I just plug in a set of speakers. When I'm out and about I plug in headphones.The touchpad is pretty good build wise, but the multi-touch software is hit or miss. When trying to use the 2 finger scroll when in a web browser it would half the time think i was doing a pinch to zoom.The reason I got this particular model is that it had USB 3. I have an external harddrive that I used to transfer files over to this computer and with USB 3, it took half the time. Also an added bonus was that the HDMI port doubles as an extra USB port(giving you 4 in total). I haven't used the HDMI port yet, but when I do I'll add an update about that. Also included is an eSATA port(I'm sure this would be a peppy way to transfer files, but USB 3 works well enough).A surprise was the built-in WiMax modem (which let you're computer be a wireless hotspot!). I didn't know about that when I ordered it, and I'm not sure if I'm going to sign up for it. It seems odd that it came with WiMax, but no bluetooth though. I think I would've preferred to have that instead.So overall it's pretty good, but a little bit of a mixed bag when it comes to the screen.Software & OS:Not too long after I got this I switched over to Ubuntu. I just generally like Ubunutu because it runs light, restarts pretty quick and keeps everything simple, with out being overbearing like OS X. I still boot into Windows 7 though to get my civilization V fix though. There was a ton of stuff pre-loaded on here, but not all of it is bloatware. A lot of the official Lenovo software is security related including stuff to run the fingerprint scanner, one that asks for your password when you plug a USB drive. Battery saver which keeps you from charging the battery all the way to improve the lifespan of it. And finally a hard Drive saver which will lock the drive if you (Gawd forbid) end up dropping the computer. There is stuff to uninstall, but didn't take too much time to get rid of.Ubuntu was a pain to setup because of the standard wifi issues that seem to always be there, but once that's taken care of it's been perfect.Overall:This is the Honda Accord of laptops. This laptop is an amazing deal and well worth the money. Is this a high end gaming machine? No, it's a mid-level, everyday machine. It will play Netflix with ease and run mid level games with out breaking a sweat. It's classy in a subdued way, solid, reliable and feels like I'll be holding on to this for a long time.", "Date": "April 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Significant bang for buck", "Author": "julietBravo \"jBravo\"", "ReviewID": "RKO11SVCGFRMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this notebook/laptop under $500 USD as a quick tool for a short IT project.  Being accustomed to high-end enterprise-class notebooks (fast, lightweight, solid build), this seemed risky, but at that price and spec, add a warranty/service plan just in case, how could one resist?  (Disposable <$500 PCs: what a novel idea!)Ten months later, after much project travel, this is my rock-solid, non-enterprise class \"go-to\" PC.  The 6GB memory with an i5 proc running Win7 x64 packs some useful power.  For instance, I can do presentations and demos running two virtual machines.  The keyboard is the best I've used so far; I do a lot of typing and content creation, and I'll reach for the V570 to do most of my writing on it rather than the other high-end PCs.  The biometric fingerprint reader works well, and the built-in ports (HDMI, VGA, e-SATA) are handy when the ultra doesn't deliver.  Lenovo's boot optimizer actually works and is a nice cherry atop the other performance highlights.The build and finish is surprisingly good.  The weight and thickness is decent for a non-ultra book, and it's held up well over time.  The only battle wound is a dent in the outer display cover after some typical airport checkpoint abuse.What has proved the most frustrating to me (and other reviewers) is the multi-touch pad (Synaptics v8.0.4):  It will do all your typical multi-touch gestures well, however it will occasionally snap into zoom mode while typing, causing your editor/app to suddenly zoom in or out rapidly.  This happens even if your left palm is simply resting on the left palm reset, far left of the touchpad.  Touchpad adjustments to PalmCheck have not solved this problem.Yes, there are a few other things that are annoying, but most are due to my being spoiled by models costing 3x more.  Battery life is not fantastic, not surviving a 5-hr flight if stuck in coach.  The keyboard is not backlit, and there's no built-in Bluetooth, so you cannot use all those devices you bought unless you strap on a USB Bluetooth adapter.  The 768-pixel display height is tough on some applications, esp. app dev and diagramming where I prefer a bit more res/height.  It goes without saying that this display is not stellar but functional considering the price.  And the built-in speakers are sub-par, distorting most audio at reasonable volume.  Using it as a quick speakerphone (built-in mic with built-in speakers) is not advisable due to lack of built-in noise/feedback cancellation, but this is solved with external devices I already have (USB headset, speakerphone).All these negatives are offset by the memory, proc and power for that crazy price.  If they can still find them, and they don't need the latest, sexiest, status symbol, I highly recommend it to friends and colleagues to be their bang-for-buck PC.UsageBackup PC for consulting, software development, document creation, diagramming, demo'ing tech via virtualization, light video editing, watching video content/movies while travelling, VOIP/video conferencing, and your standard business activities. It's used as a UPnP media source ([...]) as well.
