\"Ivy Bridge.\" The 2.9GHz Intel Core i7 dual-core processor just makes this MacBook Pro fly. And it runs much cooler than its predecessors. I had my laptop running while on my lap for a couple hours and the bottom case was barely warm. Fan noise was not noticeable whatsoever. To be honest, I don't even know if the fan was operating or not, it was that quiet.The aluminum  unibody case has remained pretty much unchanged for several years. In fact, my previous MacBook Pro, a 2.4GHz Intel Core 2 Duo with 4GB of RAM has the identical case that this new laptop has... it is designated as Model No: A1278 if you look at the bottom of the laptop case.What Apple threw into the mix, which made my decision of which new Apple laptop to purchase more difficult, was the addition of the Retina Display MacBook. Initially I was tormented with making the correct decision of which computer to purchase. After I weighed the differences and factored in the cost, it became clear to me that for my use, the 13\" MacBook Pro was the way to go rather than an Air or Retina Display MacBook Pro. Here are my reasons...-The Retina Display MacBook lacks an optical drive. For me, that was a critical feature as I am a Mobile DJ and still rip a lot of CD's to my computer. I did not want to have to carry around an external optical drive so having the internal optical drive on the new MacBook Pro was key.-The Retina Display MacBook does not have an Ethernet port. Again, this won't affect all people, but for me it was an essential feature that I use all the time. I wasn't ready to give up my dedicated ethernet connectivity port.-The Retina Display MacBook was priced out of my comfort zone. It's a phenomenal computer but I just could not justify the price.-The Air doesn't offer the disk space that I need nor the right combination of ports.Honestly, the display on the 13.3\" MacBook Pro is gorgeous. I can see where a photographer might enjoy the Retina Display, but for me, the 1280x800 resolution of the screen on this laptop is perfect. The display is bright, very bright, sharp and has excellent viewing from side to side. I'm a little conflicted with the glossy screen, but I think I have grudgingly accepted it for the most part. In most situations I find it nicer than a glare-free screen. For some situations however, it is not the best because of the reflections on the screen of surrounding lights and such. You must remember that while reducing glare on a screen might make it easier to view in certain situations by reducing reflections of light and surroundings, by its nature the anti-glare will reduce sharpness of the screen image. By having the glossy screen you have an amazingly bright, clear and sharp image that is just beautiful to view.I had also considered getting an early 2012 refurbished MacBook Pro. That was my second-best option. But for the small difference in price, I would not have gotten USB 3.0 ports and that was important to me, as well as getting Thunderbolt. Admittedly, there are not yet many peripherals that utilize Thunderbolt or USB 3.0 but that is certainly going to change quite rapidly. USB 3.0 is 10 times faster than USB 2.0 and offers throughput of up to 5Gbps.  Thunderbolt is even faster and allows daisy-chaining of monitors and other devices. This new MacBook Pro also has an upgraded facetime camera. It is now 720p HD and that's pretty awesome.Firewire 800 is still included on this MacBook Pro. Undoubtedly, Firewire is getting towards the end of its lifespan but many videographers are still using video cameras that use Firewire and I also have external hard drives using firewire, so this is still useful for me.The newly added Tunderbolt port is also useable as a mini-display port and you can easily obtain adapters to enable you to hook up to DVI, VAG and HDMI. I do miss not having a dedicated HDMI port, but at least it is possible to get an adapter to fill that need.The Lion and soon to be released Mountain Lion operating system has garnered a lot of comments both positive and negative. Personally I have not experienced any issues with Lion. The integration with iCloud is fantastic and allows me to keep my contacts, address book, bookmarks all in sync across all my devices (iMac, iPhone, iPod Touch and another MacBook Pro.)The iLife suite of applicatons included with the computer are excellent. iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand are tightly integrated and work well. There is room for improvement, to be sure, but I use iPhoto and iMovie all the time and it is an amazingly capable duo.If you're considering a MacBook Pro for the first time and are coming from the PC world, welcome. You will have a little adjusting to do but it's really easy and you will probably be impressed with how straightforward the operating system is. It just works. I can't even think of when I had a crash or freeze.I've not yet reached the 7-hours mark for  battery life, but still, I've been getting at least 5 hours plus so no complaints.If you are considering the new MacBook Pro and you're already a Mac user then you will welcome the addition of a much faster processor, the addition of Thunderbolt and USB 3.0.I am really liking my new MacBook Pro and with 8GB of RAM, and the new i7 Processor running at 2.9GHZ (turbo-boost to 3.6GHz) you will be very happy with the performance.Regarding the 8GB RAM memory maximum for this MacBook Pro, it is interesting to note that Crucial sells a 16GB RAM kit for this particular model. Despite this, Apple does not acknowledge that the computer will accept 16GB of RAM. I called Apple Technical Support to ask about this and I was told that even though the computer may accept 16GB of RAM and seem to run without any problems with 16GB of RAM, the full amount of RAM may not actually be used by the MacBook Pro. It's kind of hard to say what the implications are of adding 16GB of RAM when Apple says the maximum is 8GB for this model. What will happen though is if you have any issues with the computer and Apple discovers that you've put 16GB of RAM in it, you could be denied service under the warranty. So I guess I'd be happy with 8GB of RAM until this issue gets more clarification, either by benchmark tests that show an improvement in performance or a firmware update or some acknowledgment from Apple approving the option of 16GB of RAM. I\"d like to think that if Apple wanted to make as much money as possible that they would offer this computer with an 16GB option. Since they don't, there must be a technical reason why.I've been using a protective case for my MacBook Pro and I recommend it. It's priced very fairly, comes in a variety of colors and has worked really well for me. It even lets the Apple Logo shine through the case. Here is a link to the Red color version of the case. RED iPearl mCover\u00ae Hard Shell Case for A1278 Aluminum Unibody MacBook Pro 13-inch (RED color)UPDATE: July 1, 2012 - I've been reading reports online about the fact that the new Retina Display MacBook Pro has pushed the graphics handling capabilities of the computer to the max. This has resulted in some problems that are only just beginning to manifest themselves, such as sluggish screen draw in some situations, slow frame rates in other situations and image retention issues.In other words, by pushing the limits, as Apple frequently does (and I'm not suggesting that that's a bad thing) early adopters are paying the price. So I'm feeling even better about choosing this particular model rather than spending significantly more for the Retina Display MacBook Pro and having to deal with the first generation issues.UPDATE: July 5, 2012 - Note to PC users considering the switch to a Mac. Don't be intimidated to switch. Mac OSX is a fantastic operating system and not difficult to learn at all. But there are definitely some subtle differences between the PC and Mac user interface and experience. I would strongly suggest getting a good book such as Switching to the Mac: The Missing Manual, Lion Edition. It's an excellent overview of what you'll need to know regarding the Mac experience and the Lion operating system. I use both Windows 7 and Mac OSX and own both a PC laptop and Mac laptop and desktop machines. I consider Macs to be my primary computer because of my familiarity with them and their ease of use. However, a helpful book will ease your transition and eliminate the guesswork.UPDATE: August 24, 2012 - I've upgraded my OS to Mountain Lion, 10.8, and have been running it for about 2 weeks. I have not noticed any issues and the upgrade went very smoothly. Some of the new features are great. I particularly like the dictation feature that lets you speak while in any application that accepts text input and the MBP will automatically and accurately convert your speech to text. The new way that messages are handled is very similar to IOS and I like it. Some users are reporting less battery life but I have not noticed any degradation in battery life on my comptuer.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loving it!", "Author": "Spencer Atherton", "ReviewID": "R3H4T4E7OE0ZDA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is not my first Mac computer, and certainly will not be my last. Before I begin, I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy. I have owned many PC computers as well, and like them too. I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.To start with the strengths:1. OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable. I have it installed on my iMac desktop computer as well and love it. Not to mention this comes with a free upgrade to Mountain Lion, which is very nice.2. Screen looks great. Even though it is not the Retina display you can get on the 15.4 inch model, the screen is fantastic. Very bright and crystal clear with excellent color.3. Quietest laptop I have ever owned. Keeps quiet even when the computer is under a heavy load.4. First computer I have owned with USB 3.0. I bought an external hard drive when I purchased this laptop as well so I could utilize the USB 3.0. I got the hard drive yesterday and transferred all of my files from my old laptop to the new hard drive so I could put them on my MacBook. It took about 1/5th of the time it did with USB 2.0.5. My Lenovo laptop does not have an illuminated keyboard, so the keyboard on this laptop is a big plus in my opinion. Excellent for people that like to work or surf the web while their significant other is sleeping.6. The trackpad - can't even compare it to any trackpad I have seen on any other laptop computer.7. Excellent battery life while being a very fast performer. It definitely has the best of both worlds. I average about 6 hours on a charge. My Lenovo (with similar graphics, processor, etc. and same use) only lasts about 4 or 5 hours on a full charge.8. Typical Apple simplistic styling. I love the look of the Apple products. Simple and clean.9. Many, many more...but those are the most notable ones to me.Now, for the weaknesses.1. The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip. They may get softer and more sticky as time goes by, but right now they are far from that. The pads on the bottom of my Lenovo are definitely much better and don't allow the computer to slide around while I am using the computer on a glass topped desk.2. Price - it's a bit pricey for the performance you get, but the added perks of Mac OSX and the durability and support of Apple products makes up for it. For the same price, you can get a PC with more memory, larger hard drive, better graphics, and a faster processor, but then you remember you're running Windows 7, which isn't nearly as well built as Mac OSX.In conclusion - this is a great laptop. Although it is a little pricey, it is well worth the extra money. So far, the only issue I have with it (rubber pads) is a very small problem that does not change how this laptop performs in any way.If you are thinking about getting a MacBook Pro laptop but do not want to spend a huge amount of money for one, this is definitely the way to go. It may be considered the \"base model\" MacBook Pro, but it still an excellent computer. The size and battery life of this computer makes it excellent for people that need a laptop that is very mobile. Between work and college classes, I needed a lightweight yet durable computer and this definitely fits that criteria.9.5/10", "Date": "June 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "macbook air 13inch vs macbook pro 13inch", "Author": "intrimitido", "ReviewID": "RVJ43DY1SH9JK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this review is about my personal honest experience, i am not a computer wizard.like most of you, i had a hard time thinking which one to buy, an air or a pro. what i did is purchased the two and see which one will better suit my needs and send back the one that I won't like. so I went at my local best buy and did so. after using both products for 14days, here are my thoughts.the macbook air looks very beautiful on the outside. it's so thin and light and can be used anywhere like a tablet. to sum things up, the MB air is more of a fashion statement than a work horse. is it faster than a pro? yes only by 10-15secs during start up. the audio quality sounds thin but loud. the pro has a deeper sound. air has higher resolution but the fonts are small. what I hate about it is the screen display color. macbook pro by far has more vivid colors and if you love to watch netflix and hd videos like me, the pro is a better choice. i like the design of the air but i'm sorry to say that it is more like a toy than a real life laptop. if you have a main computer, the air is a very good addition but if you only need an all in one computer like me to take with you, store data, watch videos, do picture and video editing and plan to use for a very long time, then the macbook pro is a better choice and for me is more sturdy. one reviewer says that the air has better screen display but I don't agree with that because i am an amateur photographer and im pretty sure i know which has the better display. in the long run you will be needing that dvd drive, the storage and ram that you can customize, the ethernet and ports that are already built in and most of all the screen display. the macbook pro still looks stunningly beautiful and is a more capable laptop. even the keyboard is better to type on. the air is super light weight but the pro still is light. we still need to use our muscles sometimes. battery life are identical 5-6 hrs.I got more from my money on the pro and it is a better choice for me that's why I kept it and sent the air back for a refund. again this is just my personal honest opinion.", "Date": "March 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly unimpressive compared with new MacBook Air", "Author": "Farb Dannon", "ReviewID": "R2688UMHBW3YHE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased the newly updated 13\" MacBook Pro and the newly updated 13\" MacBook Air the day they were announced at WWDC and released for sale in June 2012. (My 13\" MacBook Pro is the 2.9 GHz i7 model, and my MacBook Air is factory upgraded to a 2.0 GHz i7 processor and 8GB RAM.)After using the two machines side-by-side for a couple weeks now, I can say that the MacBook Air outperforms the MacBook Pro in almost every task and in terms of overall speed and performance. Compared with the newly refreshed and updated Air, the new MacBook Pro is frankly a significant disappointment, and I've pretty much stopped using it altogether in favor of the faster Air. Despite the Air's slower CPU clock speed, it performs faster than the Pro in actual tasks due to the performance boost afforded by it's SSD hard drive. The SSD drive on the MacBook Air makes an enormous difference in everything from casual web browsing to video editing.If you're debating which 13\" MacBook to buy, the 13\" MacBook Air or the 13\" MacBook Pro, here's a side-by-side comparison...Speed and Performance: Advantage MacBook AirApart from the hard drives and port configurations, the technology inside the machines is virtually identical in both the newly refreshed MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. Both Pros and Airs come with either i5 or i7 Intel \"Ivy Bridge\" processors, Intel HD Graphics 4000, USB 3.0, and lightning-fast Thunderbolt ports. While the MacBook Air models are at a disadvantage to the MacBook Pro models in terms of CPU clock speeds, any performance disadvantage from the processor speed is more than made up for by the lightning fast performance of the Air's SSD hard drive, which Apple markets as \"Flash\" storage. In everyday tasks from gaming to web browsing to watching Flash movies and editing video, the MacBook Air is faster significantly faster in virtually every task. The Air boots up in less than 12 seconds while the Pro takes upwards of one minute.Screen: Advantage MacBook AirIf you've never used a MacBook Air, much less the new Retina display 15\" MacBook Pro, then you won't notice just how outdated the MacBook pro's screen is. However, once you get used to the super high resolution 1440 x 900 LED display on the MacBook Air, the 1280 x 800 back-lit LED display on the MacBook Pro looks downright grainy and primitive. Simply put, once you get used to a higher resolution display, the 1280 x 800 display on the 13\" MacBook Pro just isn't acceptable. Even for simple tasks like email or word processing where you wouldn't think the resolution would matter, the graphics look grainy and pixelated, which just isn't acceptable for a pro-level laptop in 2012.Upgradability: Advantage MacBook ProThe Pro's only major advantage over the Air comes in terms of the flexibility of its hardware, ease of repair, and upgradability. With only a screw driver and about 10 minutes of your time, you can add more memory to the Pro, replace the hard drive, and even add a second hard drive in place of the optical disc drive. The Air, on the other hand, is stuck in the configuration you purchase it in except that you can opt to replace the SSD \"Flash\" hard drive with a higher capacity SSD drive.Design, Weight, Portability, Battery Life, and Form Factor: Advantage MacBook AirThe MacBook Air is the most beautiful computer ever produced by man, and the MacBook Pro looks like it's older, pudgy relative. The Air's aluminum case is impeccably designed, almost tailored to accommodate the necessary internal components, while maintaining practical ergonomics. It's an incredibly thin, svelte, sexy little notebook. The MacBook Air's aluminum case seems sturdy and durable, and its mechanics are very similar to the time-test unibody construction of the MacBook Pro. The MacBook Pro, on the other hand, is a bit of a dinosaur in its bulky circa 2006 unibody. The Pro is heavier than a half gallon of milk at 4.5 lbs, while the MacBook Air weighs in at less than 2.9 lbs. Battery life is roughly even on both machines at anywhere from 4 to 7 hours depending on workload and settings.Summary Judgement: Buy the MacBook Air (or opt for the new 15\" Retina display MacBook Pro)Simply put, the guts of the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro are basically the same, but the Air's SSD hard drive gives it a tremendously significant boost in performance. Sadly, the MacBook Pro's 5400-rpm hard drive leaves the machine unable to capitalize on the newest, most expensive Intel \"Ivy Bridge\" i5 and i7 processors that you're paying a $300 premium for in the newly updated Pros. If you are going to buy a Pro, invest the extra money and get it upgraded with a SSD hard drive and get an extra external hard drive if you need additional cheap storage space for multimedia files. When you also consider the superior display, lighter weight, increased portability, and lower price of the MacBook Air, it's hard to find a reason to justify purchasing the current 13\" MacBook Pro, which to me looks like a dinosaur rapidly headed for extinction.Specs on the models compared:13\" MacBook Air (mid 2012) factory upgraded to the 2.0 GHz dual core i7 processor and factory upgraded to 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM) with standard 256 GB SSD (\"Flash\") hard drive13\" MacBook Pro (mid 2012) with 2.9 GHz dual core i7 processor, 8 GB RAM (1600MHz DDR3L SDRAM), and 750GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpmBoth feature Intel HD 4000 Graphics, 3.0 USB, Thunderbolt, 802.11n, etc.", "Date": "June 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simply the best computer I've ever used... with one possibly irrelevant issue", "Author": "Elizabeth A. Schauble \"Azunai\"", "ReviewID": "R3BX8E2I17GA4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to be a die hard windows fan. I was always bashing OSx for the usual things (too expensive, too dumb, et cetera, et cetera), and I never really gave it a chance. Windows 7 was my OS of choice from the day it came out, and I used it on many different computers with (or at least what I thought then) good results. It's certainly not a bad OS but...This past holiday season, I got an Asus tablet PC. I wanted to love it, I really did. I gave it a five star review here on Amazon, and I tried my very hardest to use it to it's fullest potential. It was working fine for a while, until I tried the Windows 8 beta. It was all down-hill from there. Viruses, problems (beyond those that should be in a beta, and a general ugliness drove me absolutely insane, and I decided to move away from Windows, at least temporarily. I bought a Chromebook, and while I absolutely love it and highly recommend it, I wanted more out a computer than it offered.So, nearly on a whim, I bought a Mac. I have never made a better tech decision. Literally everything about it is better than any computer I've ever used, from the operating system to the hardware.People typically say that the real reason they love Macs and other Apple products is because of the build quality. While the build quality on this computer is INSANELY good (I feel bad hauling it around with me; I feel like it should be in an art museum), I really think it's the software that makes this a standout computer and computing experience. I've had absolutely zero backround in OSx up until now, and already I am easily finding my way around this computer. Granted, I've had a good backround in Linux and OSx is similar, but the fact that I'm easily navigating a brand new operating system after only one day is quite the contrast from Windows, now that I can look at it objectively. OSx Lion is wonderful. The multi-touch gestures and the multi-touch mouse itself are immensely helpful, and it's because of features like these that make it clear to me that it's almost necessary for a company to make the hardware for a product if they're making the software as well. Everything works extremely well together.Like I said, the included apps put Windows to shame. With the exception of Outlook (which I personally hate, but my Mom has a Mac and can't stand the contacts App and uses Outlook), I can't think of a single, rational person who would pick Windows software over Apple software when it comes to things like media, photo/video editing, and email. To be perfectly honest, it's ridiculous how well all this stuff works. I downloaded the iWorks office suite (which is not free, though significantly cheaper than Microsoft Office), and they also work like a charm. I really don't create a whole lot of spreadsheets or slide shows so I can't guarantee a qualified opinion on Numbers (Excel) or Keynote (PowerPoint), but the Pages app is lightyears ahead of Microsoft Word. I also downloaded Logic Pro 9 (an music synthesizer/recording studio app) after having used it with friends a few months back, and have spent hours digging into another fantastic piece of Mac Software, and I can say for a fact that it is truly unparalleled in the Windows world.The actual hardware internals of the computer are amazing. The new Ivy Bridge processors whip through anything I can throw at them, and the 8 gb of fast (1600 mhz) ram makes multi-tasking a breeze. The nVidia graphics card, while not a show-stopper, is completely adequate for some heavy-duty video editing in something like Final Cut or Photo Shop (though I haven't used Photo Shop in about a year now, so I'm not COMPLETELY sure about the latter of the two statements), or gaming (whether you dual-boot or pick one of the games from the increasingly impressive OSx catalogue). The speakers, while not mind-blowing, are much better than what I'm used to from integrated laptop speakers, and the screen, even though I opted for the non-HD screen, is very good; colors are bright and saturated, the pixel density is more than satisfactory, and the viewing angles are some of the best I've ever seen. Battery life is as good as advertised, and the computer starts and runs much more quickly than I'm used to, especially considering that this computer doesn't have flash storage.I haven't run into a single thing I would change about this computer up to this point. I love the software, I love the hardware, and I love my decision. If you're in the market for an exceptional, powerful notebook, look no further. I can't recommend this computer highly enough.Edit: While the great things that I mentioned about OSx are all still completely viable and even after several weeks (months, perhaps?) of heavy usage I haven't experienced any problems. Mountain Lion is a great update and even though I don't own an iPhone or an iPad (I'm more of an android guy), I still like almost all of the additions it brings to OSx.However, I have since installed Windows. Bootcamp is a marvelous program, and in about 20 minutes I had Windows 7 working great on my computer. All the drivers were installed and performance was great. Once I actually started playing games though, several design flaw were suddenly extremely apparent to me, and they were apparent in a very bad way.I'm not sure if Windows is just a more demanding operating system or if a fan driver was left out of my Bootcamp install, but the cooling of this computer when doing ANYTHING intensive under Windows is absolutely atrocious. The unibody design is gorgeous. It's revolutionary, it's stylish, it's classy, and it has major practical issues. The vents are hidden under the hinges of the screen, and anything but the most perfect of screen angles will block off much of the fans output. Even with the fans blowing full blast at nearly all times while running Windows, the computer gets extremely hot during usage. I use a laptop as a literal \"lap\" top computer frequently. This works fine under OSx; it's impossible under Windows. The bottom of the computer gets painfully hot during heavy usage (to the point where I literally can't touch it for more than a few seconds), and the metal area (ironically) around the \"wasd\" keys gets extremely hot as well. I've had the computer completely overheat three times only in the past two weeks. Since I only play online games, this isn't a real issue, but I can't imagine what would happen were someone actually doing something important on a Windows partition and have the computer overheat and shut down. Even with good ventilation (meaning smooth granite surfaces and a laptop stand specifically designed to enhance ventilation), there is no avoiding an extremely hot computer and constantly whirring fans.Long story short, I'm very glad they improved the fan design in the Retina Display Macbooks, because it is, frankly, very, very poor here.I'm conflicted on whether I should change my overall rating of the computer though. Even though Macs are equipped (through Bootcamp) to run Windows, they weren't designed to do so, and I certainly haven't had a single issue while running (the far superior) OSx. Considering the fact that I should be basing my opinion of the product on its own merits and not on those of a competing product, I don't think I will change my overall scoring. I do think it is prudent to add, however, that cooling while running Windows 7 is terrible. If you NEED Windows, stick with a Windows computer. They will most likely handle Windows better than this one will.", "Date": "June 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Used item being sold as new", "Author": "sinclairvoyant", "ReviewID": "R2XQ1JNF39YUKH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I just want to issue a warning to people who purchase this product trying to save a bit over Apple prices.

Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop. I've always been a Windows guy so I've known that you can buy laptops with equivalent specs to Macs for a good deal cheaper. Though after comparing different laptops I was not able to find one that had  a satisfactory build quality. The closest I could find were laptops made by Asus, but even then I read of too many build quality issues that made me uneasy. Ultrabooks made by other companies had good quality, but by then they cost just as much as the MacBook but with lower specs.  So I decided to take the plunge with this MacBook after demoing it in a Apple Store. Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase:Build Quality - Seriously, you can't beat a unibody construction. While other laptops creak when you pick them up due to the various plastic components screwed together, the Macbook feels firm. The only thing that initially concerned me was that the lid would slightly creak when you closed it. Running waxed dental floss through the hinges solved this.Trackpad and Keyboard- This extra large trackpad is heavenly to use. Having the whole trackpad function as a giant button is a lot more comfortable to use. Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive. The keyboard keys are well spaced and the led backlighting is very cool.Power System - I regularly get around 6 hours from the battery, which I am more than satisfied with. The magsafe plugin system is more handy than I thought it would be, and there is a neat led battery indicator on the side of the notebook that makes checking the battery level with the computer off easy.OS X - Mine initially came with Lion, but after upgrading to Mountain Lion I am even more satisfied. Everything runs fast and animations are fluid. I love the multi touch features, which again is something I initially didn't think I would really need. It took me a little time to get used to using finder after being accustomed to windows explorer, but I am confident now in my ability to navigate through files just as quickly as in Windows.Dual Booting - I have a few engineering programs that only run on Windows so I decided to install Windows 7 through bootcamp.  Because it boots natively from the hard drive, it runs just as smoothly as any other Windows laptop. Remember folks, this computer doesn't have any magical internal components. The Intel Chipset is the same used in any other laptop and thus Windows runs just the same with the proper drivers installed.Chipset - The Intel Core i5 runs very fast with minimal heat. The Intel Graphics 4000 is more than adequate for most applications.I could even run Portal 2 on maximum graphics settings and play 1080p video without it breaking a sweat. The fan almost never revs up to an audible level. This is in part to the aluminum body being a giant heat sink. So yes, the laptop body can get warm at times. But it is never uncomfortably warm when I use it on my lap. Ill probably upgrade the RAM and the harddrive to an SSD in the future, but for now they are fine.So all in all I am very happy with my purchase. I am officially a Mac convert and will use this laptop for a very long time.Also, all the Windows \"gamers\" who are trashing Macs need to gain some perspective. Yes, I can get a Core i7 laptop with a dedicated graphics card for a lot cheaper than the MacBook. But I decided to spend the extra money to get a better engineered laptop with some nifty extra features.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "DON'T BUY THIS, IT'S NOT A NEW ITEM!

Added an iMac about 2 years later. Then, switched back to primarily PC for work on a HP Envy 14. I also took some time to build a sweet gaming PC rig. And now, after selling the iMac (not really used since college), the gaming PC and the HP Envy 14, I have hopped back onto this MacBook Pro 13 inch.I'm very glad to be back on an Apple product. Having used PCs exclusively for the last 2 years, I can identify a few specific reasons why I wanted to get back to Mac.1) Mouse mechanics - there is really nothing in the PC market that compares to the Mac trackpad. The closest alternative to its smooth, accurate and conveniently place functionality is the Lenovo ThinkPad's red nipple. Since I work often where having to pull out a separate mouse would be inconvenient, this was an important point for me.2) Battery life - even new, the HP Envy only hits 3 hours or so on a full charge. I can squeeze close to 6 hours out of the MBP. Trips on the road make the doubled battery life very useful.3) Lion productivity features - I remember having to use a second monitor on my PC setups just for the real estate. i can honestly say that I am fine without that now when able to swipe between desktops with 3 finger motions on this trackpad. Having a second monitor anyway is a bonus now that lets me just keep iTunes or Outlook open on the side.4) Speed - Lion and the upgrades I've added to this MBP (listed above) have made this computer incredibly fast. I can crunch through 500,000 row Excel spreadsheets, update my iPhone firmware, and watch a 720p YouTube without any noticeable hitches. Startup takes less than 10 seconds, waking from start is instantaneous (so awesome and useful!), install speeds are zippy.5) Prettiness - beautiful work machines can inspire better and more creative work. It does more than just make me want to use the MBP more - it's a constant reminder of how careful planning, bold design choices, good engineering, and hard work make inspirational products.Clearly I'm a fan. Still, I'm going to deduct a star for three reasons:1) Price - it's expensive for the components inside. The price essentially values the Lion OS X and integrated software/hardware at something like $200 over similar Windows systems.2) Fragile aesthetics - the aluminum frame scratches a little too easily and the glossy screen picks up fingerprints/oil. I'm babying the hell out of this MBP, which means taking off my aircraft aluminum watch before using it and wiping its screen down about once every other day.3) Glossy screen - screen glare makes working in sunlight basically impossible.", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Counterfiet product", "Author": "MARIANO MUSSI", "ReviewID": "RC3RCV89ECK1V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was dissapointed by Amazon.

And at first I was thinking I was going to get something like a i7 with dedicated Gpu windows computer. But I am glad I didn't!FOR ALL WINDOWS FANS, first of all I want to share that I do not hate windows since I game on my windows desktop that I built myself.But my experience with windows laptops has not been the best. Always had miscellaneous problems with video drivers, screen, touch pad you name it! But I thought to myself that hey! at least I have really good spec laptop. Wrong! once I switched to mac all those things seemed unacceptable! I have now noticed that apple really take their time making their laptops and quality is there as well! Now here are some of my reviews of the specs.Cpu- although its a dual core it has more than enough speed for everyday useGpu- although its a integrated gpu it has more than enough everyday power for regular use. (unless your a gamer, or need the dedicated gpu for high demanding work) , which a lot of us do not need for college.Hard drive - this is the one thing I am considering upgrading for the 5400 rpm speed to a 7200 rpm hard drive since it is a cheap but effective upgrade for boot times and opening apps.Ram - this I am not even considering upgrading since this ram is fast and 4GB is more than enough for everyday use. The only reason I would upgrade is if I would be running many apps at the same time.Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous. I will also say it is much better than I expected! Since the contrast of colors makes it seem so crisp! I would go as far as saying the colors and contrast is better than some pc laptops with higher res screens.Cooling design- I also think this is better since MB's do not has fans under and on the sides where when you have it on your lap it will suck in a considering of dust. The mac-book's cooling system is made in a way where you can actually consider it a LAP top.Other things like DVD-RW drive was my deal breaker to get the non-retina pro since I need it.Also the network plug is a plus since if you do not have reliable wifi it will come in handy!Back-lit keyboard which also was a must and is am glad to say it is very good.Speakers- are the one thing I miss from my windows laptop. Since these are loud enough if there are no loud obstructions near you, but do not let throw you off because they are fine for moderate noises for example: at starbucks.Touchpad- this is the most profound thing that makes any other touchpad inferior and make it feel way ahead of it's time! Makes web browsing a breeze and switching either from windows, to desktop or anything a breeze!This laptop is light enough to carry in your backpack the whole day. Has a nice aluminum finish, but I considered getting a sleeve and case to ensure I would not damage or scratch it.If you need the extra performance I would strongly urge you to get a 15\" MBP since they have the added dedicated Gpu, i7 Cpu, and better speakers.If you need a windows operating system for a app then I would urge you to partition your hard drive for both os systems since you will still use mac os much much much more!All in all many people (like me) think they need a high spec laptop for school which is not true!

My previous MacBook allowed replacement of the internal battery in 10 seconds, with no tools.2)  OS 10.8 is definitely \"dumbed down\" as compared with 10.6.  10.8 now has \"Windows like\" hidden files (this can be disabled).3)  \"Bounce\" has been removed from the Apple Mail program.  \"Bounce\" is a great tool to let people know you don't want any further e-mails from them.

Though friendly, Apple Care was far from truly helpful. I looked up online and found that this is a persisting and common problem with Macs. Apple refuses to admit that there is a problem and maintains that even though there are thousands of bloggers with their own angry stories. Macs are sold and marketed as a business and school laptop... but it fails miserably since it cannot be relied upon for a business transaction or a online test (my sister bought the same one and has the same problems... she prays every time she takes an online exam it doesnt disconnect).

It's ideal for FaceTime chats and VoIP applications.The FaceTime camera in the top bezel supports full 720p HD.While the battery life is rated at 7 hours, my time averages about 5 hours, but it recharges very quickly.I'm a fan of Extended Warranties like the well-known AppleCare, which allows you to take your computer to your nearest Apple store and let the Geniuses take care of the rest. I opted for the SquareTrade 3-Year Computer Accidental Protection Warranty ($1500-2000) which also support \"accidents\" like drops and spills that are NOT covered by AppleCare. Unlike AppleCare, though, it's a mail-in service with a 5-day guaranty.All of that's great, but to really soup it up, I upgraded the RAM to 16 GB with something like the Corsair Vengeance Laptop Memory Kit 16 GB (2x8 GB) DDR3 1600MHz CL10 PC3 12800 (CMSX16GX3M2A1600C10). That's a quick upgrade that even a novice can do in under 30 minutes. You'll need a small phillips screw driver and a nylon pry tool. If you're going to do any upgrades such as RAM or hard drive, I recommend the NewerTech 11 Piece Computer ToolKit. It contains all the various screw drivers (phillips and torx) needed for Apple devices and 2 nylon pry tools.Another upgrade that's a little more difficult is upgrading the hard drive to either a larger drive like the Western Digital 1 TB Scorpio Blue SATA II 5400 RPM 8 MB Cache 2.5-Inch Bulk/OEM Notebook Hard Drive - WD10JPVT or an SSD flash drive like the Crucial 256 GB m4 2.5-Inch Solid State Drive SATA 6Gb/s CT256M4SSD2.Both of those upgrades shouldn't void the warranty according to the FTC's Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act of 1975, though the upgraded components would be covered by its manufacturer's warranty and not Apple.I use a lot of virtual machines and photo and video editing software, so I went all-out, though, and used the OWC Data Doubler Optical drive to SATA Hard Drive/SSD Converter to replace the SuperDrive with the stock hard drive, installed 16 GB RAM, and a 256 GB SSD. NOTE: These modifications are NOT covered by AppleCare, and I wouldn't recommend going that far unless you're comfortable with more advanced computer issues.That said, this laptop is screaming and wicked-fast. I easily see it lasting me 4+ years.", "Date": "July 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Are You Kidding Me?", "Author": "RJM402", "ReviewID": "R24HBVKGZFMWVO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a lifelong PC lover, I not only hated MACs, but thought they were akin to an instrument of the Evil Empire.After three PC fiascoes in a row - I switched!

I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.  He explained to me the battery expansion is \"normal\".  Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.  The battery is simply considered \"consumable\" and NOT covered.I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.  His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: \"Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear!

After learning from many who use macs, and the software that's offered, I caught a real bad case of the Joneses and purchased one of these bad boys that I had never gave much thought to in the past. I was so convinced I would love it, I bought 8 gigs of Crucial ram and a geeky toolkit to install it with (which worked very well). Sadly, I just don't get it. Well, I kind of do, but I did not fall in love with it like planned.PROS:1. Everything, and I mean, everything, looks beautiful. Not just the aesthetics, but every single piece of software looks great. OS X designers are light years ahead of Windows, I am 100% convinced of that.2. The App store is amazing, and full of useful software to help with any task you need to perform, especially with Design. This is the #1 reason I wanted to switch to Mac, because of all the wonderful apps that are available that function AND look amazing.3. The trackpad is bananas. I never used my laptops mousepad, because it sucked. The Mac's mousepad is genius.4. The power cord confused the heck out of me at first, but once I figured it out I was very impressed. And the way it connects by a magnet is the coolest thing I have seen in a long time on a computer.5. Expose, Spaces, and Hot corners are genius. Whoever is responsible for those deserves to retire young and be set for life.Cons:I can safely say that most of these cons are opinion and preference based. So please don't take offense if you don't agree.1. Price. I am not fully convinced the high cost is worth it.2. Performance. The performance was fine, but it didn't blow me away like some people who I talked to tried to convince me it would :) Boot up was pretty slow, a lot slower than my 3 year old Vaio running Windows 8. In fact, they pretty much run at the same speeds. But the Mac is a little faster than my Vaio when it is running Windows 7.3. Display. The glossy screen ruined it for me. As I mentioned, I do design work, so any time I try and make something with a Dark background, the screen literally turns into a mirror. I couldn't believe it, and would not recommend a glossy screen to anyone who is going to be working on dark backgrounds, or under any kind of bright lighting. Even in lower lighting, I could still see myself more than I wanted to.4. Only 2 usb ports...seems kind of...limited.5. The dock and global menu are horrible compared to the rest of the features of OS X.Unfortunately, I am returning this. I do give it 4 stars though because it truly is a great computer, but at the same time, currently, not the computer for me.

I own an iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, and long ago my first computer was an Apple II+ and I loved using the old Macintoshes in the 80s. So, I'm partial to Apple. Their products, including the MBP, are beautiful, sleek and clever. I haven't had an Apple computer in a long time.However, other than its graphics capability, this Apple computer and apparently its brethren are not ready for real work in the professional world. Apple remains a novelty item mostly living on its own island, preferring to interact with its own tribe on its own terms. I spent $5,000 on the best version of this machine available and peripherals, so I could switch from a PC. After two months of trying to make it do the things my PC laptop did, I'm about to ditch it all and buy another PC. I don't do this lightly. I've put many hours in to trying to make this work.Among the reasons:1. My printer won't work with this so I bought a new printer.2. My scanner won't work with this so I spent $150 for special software inferior to the original.3. My professional software doesn't work on Apple so I run those programs through Parallels. That makes them so very slow, more complicated, and less usable.4. The Word processing program is a more limited accommodation of the Apple system. Same for Excel, etc.5. The mail program is inadequate for managing a lot of email from multiple sources.6. The keyboard is awful and makes it a chore to navigate around a document. People who do a lot of work fast need to move around a document. We need buttons for going to the beginning and end of a document, page up and page down, and so forth. On an Apple these and other functions are either missing, hard to use, or you have to use multiple keystrokes to do them as a work-around.7. The Apple engineers have not yet discovered the delete key. Again, you have to do a work-around to delete, rather than just push a button.8. Also, the engineers at Apple don't think people use faxes anymore. Please note Apple: The world still uses faxes and you don't. It took me extra time and money to buy an external modem that would work with a Macbook, and to set it up specially with this OS. Then I learned that I can't fax out of the Mac using my professional cover page. Their cover page is nothing more than a few words on a blank piece of paper and of course looks like it was done by a 10-year-old. Again, Apple is not ready for the professional world, it's a novelty. My PC does this very easily and it looks good. I had to work around this through Windows run through Parallels. Therefore, I also had to install another version of Word through Parallels to handle the documents to be faxed. More work-arounds that are clunky, slow, and bothersome.Peripherals are very pretty, and not very functional.1. The Thunderbolt display is magnificently beautiful but rigidly low in functioning. It doesn't turn, bend, or look up and down. You do it their way or not at all. And it only talks with certain macs and never, ever anything else. You fit to the display, it doesn't try to fit to your needs. My Dell display fits what I need physically and electronically.2. The external keyboard I bought is cute and useless for hard work. It belongs in a dollhouse or the hands of a teenager writing emails and tweets. A waste of money. I bought a better one from another company.3. The magic mouse is the same ... cute and clever, but not ready for someone who needs to use the computer to write, edit, move documents, scroll around and navigate through web pages often. A waste of money. I bought a better one from another company.4. The Time Capsule I bought has great wifi and it works wonderfully with a Mac. However, not so much with anything else. It's dropped my PC on the wifi net so I can't use it to store or transfer data, which it still communicates very well with the Mac. So now the work-around is to move information back and forth with an HDD or flash drive. Ridiculous, I know. But I can't use the Mac to do the things the PC did for me so I have to have one foot in each system, still trying to make the MBP work.I spent a lot of time at the Apple store using my $99 one-to-one service being told \"No, you can't do that on a Mac.\" One-to-One service had its problems:Like the Apple products, the staff at the store was also attractive, smiling, rigid and unaccommodating. You do it their way or the highway. I do my professional work every day out of my laptop. The service included transferring all my data to the Mac, but they wanted me to leave it with them for three days even though the actual work would take far less time. Losing the machine for three days would be very hard. I had a three and a half day span in which I didn't have appointments so I could give it up for a day. I called them beforehand to ask if we could work together to get it done in one day. The woman didn't want to discuss it or hand me over to a manager. She told me to drive to the store to talk about it.I drove to the store that night after work and met with another employee, explaining I'd accommodate them any way they want as long as I just leave it for a day. She didn't turn me over to a manger. She told me to come back the next day to have it done as a one-to-one session. I came back the next day where the employee said he couldn't do this because he wasn't told it was a PC-to-Mac and he doesn't do that. He went back and forth to someone in charge, but wouldn't let me speak with anyone who could work with me. So he reiterated that the only way to do this was to leave it with them for three days, acknowledging that almost all that time it would be sitting on a shelf. I said no thanks.So the bottom line is that1. The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful capabilities.2. However, you have to adjust yourself to what it will do, not what you want it to do. It does much less than what PC's do.3. It works extremely well with other Apple products. The synchronization between the MBP and my Apple TV, iPhone and iPad is amazing and easy.4. It does not work well with any other systems or products.5. It is not ready for many forms of professional use.Right now I'm in a quandary. I've spent a lot of money and massive amounts of time trying to make this into a professional's machine. Instead, it is becoming a toy I use for limited purposes in the field, bringing information back to the PC system to be managed, communicated and stored.

I wanted the familiar  Windows OS with the hardware the MBP had to offer, but initially ran into a few problems. I'll post the problems and their solutions that I discovered in case anyone else runs into similar problems.1. After installing the drivers for Windows, my webcam didn't work. It said that the drivers were not installed yet even after I downloaded the most recent driver package from Apple. Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple. My previous laptop had software preinstalled that controlled the webcam and added effects to it, and I erroneously thought that since my MBP didnt have this program that the webcam wasn't working. After installing the drivers my webcam actually worked fine with Facebook chat.2. The MBP got REALLY hot when running windows 7. This couldnt be good for the computer components, but also posed a fire risk.Solution: while on windows I installed a program called MacFan (just google it) that after typing in a few commands in the command prompt allowed me to turn up the fan speed indefinitely to significantly cool off the laptop. While in windows the fans aren't correctly utilized according to CPU usage so you'll have to do this process upon each startup. Just search on YouTube \"how to install macfan\" for thorough instructions.3. Videos on youtube while in windows do not expand fully to the screen, instead leaving black bars on the bottom and right sides. Still haven't solved this. I'd expect adjusting the screen resolution would have an effect but I haven't tried this yet.4. The battery life decreased from 7 hours to about 2.5 hours while on Windows.This couldn't be solved either. It's just how windows works on the Mac. The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.5. When I click an icon on the taskbar, its title flashes over it. (not the biggest deal but its annoying) Updated my Nvidia drivers from their website and it solved minor graphics problems.As for my actual review of the MacBook Pro, I am very satisfied. I run both windows 7 and mountain lion on it through bootcamp (helpful detailed instructions can be found on YouTube). That way I have the ability to run all my old games and programs on windows while having the Mac side to use for top notch picture and video editing, plus the App Store. I've always preferred the relative simplicity of Microsoft office 2007 for windows, so I use that.After adjusting trackpad and click settings on the windows side, navigation is easy and fluid. The separated keyboard buttons took some adjusting to but that's not any issue. The screen is bright, clear, and rich while the backlit keyboard helps for typing in dark environments.It's about 2 pounds lighter than my previous laptop and significantly thinner, and what I'd consider to be portable. Ill be using it at college next year and will report back on just how portable it is.Graphics, processing, and RAM are all lightning fast and should be useful in intensive software that ill be using. The only problem I've noticed is that after partitioning the hard drive, startup takes a little longer (around 22 seconds total).The power cord is portable and extendable, while its nice to still have the optical drive, Ethernet port, and card slot. Only having 2 USB ports so close in proximity is a minor issue with larger thumb drives, etc. but I may just purchase a separate hub.All in all, you won't regret buying this.

Kavuri", "ReviewID": "R1KWV88UFXTQ4N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have already posted a similar review for the MBP old version, I am posting the same review here again since my review concentrates on the user interface of OS X. (not too sure whether I am allowed to do post the same review but just thought it could help some people before they switch to OS X)I have been a Windows user since I started using a computer and I never used a Mac OS X till I actually bought the MBP in 2011. So, this review would really help someone who is considering a Mac for the first time and wants to use it either at school or to remotely connect to work. This article summarizes what you would love and what you could be missing.I previously owned a desktop, a HP laptop and a Compaq laptop before I bought a MBP. Also, I still use Windows machine at work. One of the major reasons I bought the MBP was because it was available on a eBay deal from Macmall for $950. I assumed that if I did not like it, I could always sell it for at least $850 on eBay or Craigslist.Before reading the next part, please do understand that MBP and OS X come together. Things you need to know --**OS XSwitching between applications - This is one of my biggest quirks with OS X. Windows 7 does an awesome job in switching between applications. When you want to switch between the applications, you use ALT+TAB in Windows 7 and this would shift the focus to the next application. If the application is minimized in OS X, you can switch between applications by using CMD+TAB but it does not automatically bring up the other application, it just changes the active application in menu bar. I never understood the reasoning behind this, why would I just want to see the menu bar of the other application, I cannot imagine doing anything just with a menu bar.After some search on the internet I found the work around to do this in OS X. The answer is to press CMD+TAB followed by the option key (just before releasing the CMD key) to switch between the applications perfectly. You can also scroll your four fingers on the track pad to bring up all the applications and then highlight the application you want to choose to change the active application window. It is simply irritating to switch between keyboard and the track pad when you are typing some document or email. You can also use function key F11 instead of swiping the four fingers on the trackpad but at the end of the day Windows 7 does a great job here.Please do note that you can only switch directly between applications but not directly to the active window of an application when you use CMD+TAB, for example you cannot switch directly to a open second excel workbook, you have to bring up the excel application first and only then can you switch to the second excel workbook. I am aware that there is software available (namely Witch for $14) to do this but I already paid for the machine and why should I go through all this trouble and change the system registry entries to simply switch between applications.We can also use spaces and assign some shortcuts to spaces(like option+arrow) to make the switch between applications easier but you need to assign a different space to every application and this could be tedious after some time. Also the animations could make you dizzy after a while (not too sure whether everyone would share the same opinion) and there is no way you can turn off these animations AFAIK.Switching within an application - To switch between the various windows of the same application, the answer is to press CMD+~, it works but what if I have 3 open excel workbooks. Same answer as above, scroll the four fingers or press the function key F11 to see all active windows.Taskbar could be a big deal - It is irritating not to have a task bar in OS X. You can never actually know that you had two open excel workbooks or two separate browser windows at a glance. To put this into context, try working in Windows 7 grouping all your applications together all the time, in Windows 7 the users have the option to ungroup individual windows by selecting \"Combine only when taskbar is full\" in the taskbar properties. The problem with this approach in OS X is that you will never know all the application windows unless you display all the active windows or highlight the application in the docking bar.Also, the docking bar still occupies a substantial amount of screen space even in its minimal size , in Windows 7 the taskbar is comparively small. Due to the screen size and resolution constraints we usually tend to hide this docking bar on the 13\" MBP so that we can see the applications in the maximum available screen space. So either compromise on seeing the active applications in docking bar or full screen mode for applications.Again, the app Witch is the answer for taskbar but it will display these active windows only when we press CMD+TAB.Full Screen - I am addicted to seeing everything in maximized window mode in Windows 7 machines, I could never be satisfied with the default resized small windows, so I installed a free application RightZoom to address this issue. So far, so good.Quick Links - The docking bar essentially acts likes the quick link shortcuts in Windows 7. CMD+W closes the application and CMD+Q quits the application, you have to be careful enough not to press Q instead of W. Please note that closing a window does not automatically quit an application, the application is still active and consumes CPU resources.VPN Connection - Certain (or many?) VPN connection softwares like Juniper cannot be installed on OS X because some of these VPN connections connect using some plugins that are designed specifically for Internet Explorer, which is not available on OS X. I wanted to connect to work using the Microsoft Office remote desktop client but could not do it due to this restriction .External Applications - All the applications cannot be installed in OS X. There are lots of companies out there that make products just for Windows machines. I had to install StatTools for my course work and the tool was not available for OS X, so I had to work from another Windows machine at work on the weekends for my course work. I could have also installed Bootcamp and that comes up next.Bootcamp - I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on MBP. I observed that Windows 7 is slow and the hard disk makes squeaky noises when you are trying to open an application in bootcamp, also the track pad experience is not the same despite the various drivers and the keyboard layout is obviously different. You can overcome these problems by connecting the MBP to a HDTV or any monitor and then using a wireless Windows keyboard + mouse but then the whole setup is too much hassle and defeats the purpose of a laptop.Microsoft Office - The experience of using Microsoft Office on OS X is pretty subpar in comparison to Windows 7, may be it the fault of Microsoft but it is simply pretty hard for someone to transition from Office 2010 in Windows 7 to Office 2011 in OS X. For example, I am used to zooming in and out of Microsoft Word using shortcuts like Ctrl+Scroll Up (on trackpad) and Ctrl+Scroll Down but this option is not available as shortcut in the OS X version of Office. I wanted to type a formula for a cell in Excel and cannot find the formula bar. May be someone can help me if they know a way around enhancing this experience.Delete button - There is no substitute to Shift+Delete in OS X(CMD+del). Deletion followed by emptying trash is the only way to do it, if you are someone who is addicted to deleting the file at once there is no shortcut. CMD+SHIFT+DELETE is a shortcut to empty trash after you delete something (so two steps, not a major gripe).Cut + Paste - There is no such option as 'Cut+Paste' in OS X. If you want to move something to a different folder, you have to copy and paste the file into the target folder and then delete the original from the source folder. Or select the file and carefully drag the file from the source into the target folder.Preview - Preview can be used to view PDF files and image files. Preview can also be used to make some markings in a PDF file, that is pretty cool. But what if I want to see all the pictures in a folder at once using preview, the only option is to select all the images and then right click to open with preview to see the files (In certain situations we can select all images and press space bar and the photos come in a stream slideshow. Also, every time you open a PDF or an image file the preview application becomes active, I would have preferred the application to quit automatically when I close the image). In summary, it is easier and cooler in Windows 7 to view images.Software Installation - There is no control panel in OS X. Just drag the application into the trash bin and it is gone. It has traces in your system but essentially it is gone for all practical purposes. I like this easy deletion aspect in OS X.Wakeup time - The MBP is pretty fast on this aspectMountain Lion - Mountain Lion will provide you the option to wirelessely stream the content from your MBP to HDTV if you own a Apple TV (I do not know the other improvements, this stood out for me), something similar to the WiDi on the Windows laptops. Thats a really cool option, you do not need to have any HDMI cables at all to stream content.**HARDWARETrack pad - This is something you would love to use and a big selling point, you can never think of going back to other laptops after using this. I always used a mouse on the Windows laptops but never even felt the need for a mouse on the MBP. The two finger swipe to scroll and three finger swipe that replace the 'Home' and 'End' buttons, pinch and zoom for PDF document and images are pretty cool options. I was pretty amazed at the track pad when I started learning more about the OS X.Keyboard - Keys are located spaciously. My previous two laptops frequently had dirt stuck in between the keys which used to drive me crazy.Heat - HP and Compaq laptops generate so much heat that you can use them as a personal heater (I used to do it). The whirring sound made by my Compaq laptop's heat fan used to be pretty embarrassing for me in my class or in the meetings, I hated opening the laptop. In a contrast, the MBP is very calm, the fan does go up occasionally when you run some intensive applications such as office (along with some other intensive applications) or play graphic video games but you will hardly notice it.Build - Unibody aluminum build with just 10 screws at the back is something you would appreciate only when you have used other laptops made of plastic material that make creaky sounds every time you lift them. The upper lid of these other plastic material laptops tend to wobble a lot over time but the MBP's lid is pretty stiff even after 7 months of daily use (at least 3 hours a day).Screen - I personally like the fact there is no slight gap between the glossy screen and border of the lid. In other laptops dust gets stuck between the screen and the plastic and it could be really irritating when you cannot remove the dust. Screen quality, there are different manufacturers for the LCD screen, please search for 9CC3, 9CC5 and 9CC7 to know more about this. I have a 9CC3 (luckily) and it is supposed to be the best one available for a 13\" MBP.Ports - HDMI port is not available directly but you can buy a 10 feet long HDMI output cable for less than $20.DVD Drive - Other laptops tend to have DVD drive as an attachment but in a MBP it is inseparable (at least by the looks of it). The DVD drives on the two other laptops I owned before MBP used to make a quirky sound when I used to wake them up from sleep or do a restart, no such sounds on the MBP.Battery - The longest battery life out I could extract from MBP was about 6 hours with browsing. That is pretty good considering that other cheaper laptops can only last for 2.5 hours. Of course you can upgrade your battery on the other laptops but you need to compromise on the weight.Power Chord and Charger - One of my friends accidentally tripped over a $1000 Sony Vaio's power chord and the machine fell on the floor with brute force. I still remember how anxious he was till the machine powered up. This would not happen with a MBP, the chord attaches to the MBP with magnet, in case of an accident the power chord would detach itself and nothing would still happen to the MBP. The adapter is light weight and you can carry it in a backpack (no big bundles like the ones you see for HP and Dell).Function Keys - I use the function keys in Windows 7 machines to close application, essentially which means that I am going to just use F4 for pressing Ctrl+F4 or Alt+F4. I like the Apple's way of function keys, pretty easy to use and only contains what we exactly need. Ctrl+F4 and Alt+F4 are replaced by CMD+W in OS X.Webcam - 720p & perfect for Skype.Backlit Keyboard - If you have not used one without a backlit keyboard before you will love this option.Resale Value - Based on the eBay listings I can say that you could expect to recover 75% of the actual value of a MBP if you maintain it well (if sold within a year of purchase).Apple Warranty - International warranty for 1 year + easy replacement within 3 months + Apple protection for 3 years for $200 (warranty is international again) is really worth it. I felt that my battery was losing its power quickly and Apple Store promptly replaced the battery for me.Cons (the only one)Speakers Sound - Sound is kind of low for me, I really wish that it was louder.So to summarize I am impressed with the hardware by every bit and I really do not have any complaints about the hardware design.******************************************************************************In conclusion, if you are going to use your laptop for Microsoft Office and want to connect to Windows machine through Remote Desktop or VPN, I would recommend not to jump the ship to OS X and instead consider other alternatives listed below. The experience of Microsoft Office, switching between applications and productivity is much better on Windows 7.I would still recommend a MBP if you want to buy a laptop for casual browsing and simple applications at home, the hardware design is pretty awesome and Apple support is trustworthy.Alternatives to consider - Similar hardware design with Windows 7 would be a very good combination and that brings me to Windows Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks are about the same price (or in some cases cheaper than MBP), faster with a SSD and are very appealing with Windows 8 soon on the cards. I read on tech websites that HP Envy Spectre 14, Lenovo U300S, Asus Zenbook, HP Folio 13, Dell XPS and Samsung Series 9 are pretty well built like a MBP but run on Windows 7. Samsung Series 9 looks pretty good and has a 15\" option as well, so thats some good news if you are a Windows fan.", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Long Time Mac USER", "Author": "R.

Great laptop", "Author": "John Ryan", "ReviewID": "R2Q240RQGFCWUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're like me, you'll have spent ages comparing features and specs before splashing the cash on a new laptop. I certainly did, and I finally settled for a Mac.Quick word of warning: I'm a recent (this model Mac) convert from Windows to a MacBook Pro, and was lucky enough to recently upgrade to a stunning 13 inch Retina. While I love Apple products, I'm not a Mac expert, and this review is for similar non-experts who are thinking about \"converting\". Because it's a review of the MBP range, you'll find the same review on other specs - skip to the end to see the specifics on this model.Be aware, this is NOT the very latest hardware (it's been replaced by the \"Mac Book Pro with Retina\"). However, there's a strongly compelling reason to buy this model (aside from the fantastic price), but you'll need to read on to find out.Firstly, the hardware - which is just stunning. It's nicely thin and relatively light, and the screen looks surprisingly big sitting here on my lap. In common with all Apple MacBooks it's beautifully carved out of a solid slab of brushed aluminium, with a huge track-pad and a beautifully made back-lit keyboard. Apple traditionally don't brag about their hardware specs (as it's all about the experience of the machine - not just about comparison of numbers, but....In terms of hardware there are lots of options.  The one I bought was:-* * 2.5 GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with 4Gb of Memory (pretty zippy)* * 500GB hard drive (huge amounts of space for photos and videos)* * 13.3-inch LED-backlit display 1280 by 800 pixels* * Built-in FaceTime HD camera (for FaceTime or Skype calls)* * 8x slot-loading SuperDrive DVD - The last Mac Book Pro model to include one* * A Thunderbolt port for high-speed I/O and Mini DisplayPort to attach a monitor* * SDXC card slot (for photos), a FireWire 800 port, two USB 3.0 ports* * Gigabyte Ethernet connection and 802.11n Wi-Fi for wireless internet* * Beautifully designed backlit keyboard with ambient light sensor* * Preinstalled Mac OS X and iLife (free upgrade to Mavericks)Apple hardware (when comparing by pure spec) is more expensive than the equivalent running Windows, but you really do get what you pay for, and they come with incredible attention to detail. This includes the cleverly designed \"Mag Safe\" magnetic power socket - so if a small child accidentally pulls on the power cable it disconnects from the laptop rather than dragging it crashing to the floor.The only complaint I have is, all the connections are on the left hand side - including both USB ports, and it gets a bit cramped (I have two USB devices where the plug is too wide). I soon solved this by adding a set of external USB ports. Other than that - it's an wonderful laptop.As a prior Windows laptop user, the multi-touch trackpad is a real revelation. You can scroll down web pages (two fingers up/down), or scroll through web history (two fingers left/right), and the \"System Preferences\" window where you can configure the options includes a handy video demonstrating the options available. It's hard to over-state the benefit of this. It's so wonderfully accurate, it makes your laptop a real pleasure to use (again compared to my Windows laptop).As already stated, the keyboard is fantastic. Island style black keys - nicely spaced out, and back-lit. There's a set of dedicated keys along the top to control features including screen brightness, play, fast forward and stop, plus sound.Of course this is one the the last machines to get a CD/DVD drive - but even still all software is available online through the Apple Mac Store, and another nice surprise - consistently cheaper than equivalent windows software, and without the annoying collection of boxes, software keys and disks to avoid losing.Battery life is quoted at something silly - and I ran an entire day of general use (web browsing, videos, mails etc), in the end I got at least 6 hours before I started getting warnings - so you should be able to take this on a longish flight or a long train journey without any problems..Sound quality is not bad, although not as good as I'd have hoped - but I plug in external speakers myself - or better still, stream music to my Hi Fi speakers via an Apple TV. It's worth noting - you can stream anything on screen (videos or Netflix) to an Apple TV - including high quality sound. A great bonus.Although I don't often play games, I'm told the MBP is not a serious gaming machine, for for web use or video streaming it's more than capable. I can't really comment more than that.In terms of software, these are well provided for straight out of the box including free copies of:-* iPhoto - to import, edit and manage photos - including from the \"cloud\" (any photos taken on an iPhone or iPad)* Garage Band - a drum machine on your laptop* Movie Maker - to edit and publish home-made videos* Calendar, Mail and text editor etc* Reminders - to remind youSince I bought mine (July 2012), Apple announced anyone buying a new machine will also get a free copy of Pages, Numbers and Keynote (their presentation program) - but I'm not 100% sure if this includes this model as it's no longer the latest available. Even if you don't these are only around \u00a310-\u00a315 each - not the \u00a3100-\u00a3150 we're used to paying for Word. Excel and PowerPoint.During the past 18 months I've also noticed how the OS is becoming even more integrated with the iPhone, iPad and Apple TV. For example, you can now write a Pages or Numbers or Keynote (Word, Excel or PowerPoint for the rest of us) on a Mac and then view and edit them on an iPad (and the software is also free on a new iPad). You can also set a reminder on your iPhone and see it pop up on your Mac, or take a photo on your iPhone and see it appear (no wires, in fact completely automatic) on your Mac in the iPhoto application. This may not be a compelling reason to buy THIS particular model, but it is a great advantage if you already have (or plan to buy) and iPhone or iPad.But, (and this is ironic really), one the best reasons to buy this particular model of machine (and not the very latest Mac Book Pro with retina display), is you can upgrade it. It's a little known fact, that starting with the 2013 Macs, Apple decided to prevent ANY upgrades - including memory and disk. (The memory is literally soldered in place). If I understand it correctly, this is one the very last MBP models you can actually increase the memory or replace the hard disk. For example, I bought and installed a Samsung 840 EVO 250GB 2.5 inch Basic SATA Solid State Drive to upgrade the hard drive, and it now REALLY FLIES. Much faster than it was before, and it means I'll get a few more years out of it.Whenever I can afford it, I'll also buy a memory upgrade from 4Gb to 8 or even 16Gb.On balance - I'd have to say I love Apple Macs - and indeed all Apple hardware (iPhone, iPad included) so it's hard to give a purely objective view. But this is a beautifully designed, well built machine.

No you cannot. There are many PC laptops that have copied the MacBook design but not one of them comes close at surpassing it.  This is a laptop with almost no fault. Awesome design, great screen, great speakers, blazing SSD, and build quality only Apple seems to pull off at such a small size.You can shop around and find a lot of laptops that have better this and better that, but where Apple excels is making everything great and not skimping on anything. That is why I love this thing.Pros:Awesome ScreenGood SpeakersBoots in 14 secondsVery FastBest Trackpad design, no one even comes close here.Great KeyboardThunderboltCons:If at certain angles edges can be a little sharp.No DVD drive (does not bother me, but some might find it annoying)Keyboard lacks numpad (not a big deal to me, but if you work a lot with numbers it's something to think about)Only two USB ports (If you plan on plugging a lot of crap into your MBP then you might want to invest in a hub)So while the MBP is not perfect, it comes closer to it then any other laptop out there.

I come from the high-end Windows laptop user base; my previous laptop was a Dell XPS. I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem. If you are considering switching from a Windows computer, do it. I have no regrets. OS X is simply amazing, and while there is a learning curve if you're coming from another OS, it's easy as pie to understand. Everything just works on a Mac. WIth the exception of some games- but with Boot Camp you can install Windows on any Mac.  And this MacBook looks as good as it performs. Simple details, crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops. This computer exceeds my expectations in almost every category.My only issues with the laptop are as follows:1) It looks beautiful. Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily. You're better off buying a case alongside the purchase of your mac. A keyboard cover also wouldn't hurt. A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.2) There is no HDMI port. This is an issue for me, as I frequently connect my computer to my television. But there is a simple solution; purchase a mini-displayport to HDMI adapter.3) The sound on this laptop is severely lacking. On my previous XPS (and other mid-range laptops) sound really wasn't an issue. But with this laptop, the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny. My solution to this was to purchase Boom by Global Delight ([...]). Boom is a software application that adds sort of system wide equalizer to the Mac, thus affecting all outgoing sounds. It's a good fix, in my opinion. I have it set up to bass boost all the time, and the music comes out sounding decent, if not SLIGHTLY tinny (MUCH less tinny than before).So there you have it.

Purchasing Parellels to run Windows fixes the problem, but that's just another added cost to the already high price.

You can spend $1,300 on a mac, and 3 years later still get 700+. A windows version will set you back $800 or so, and constantly have to be updated, and the value after 3 years will be 300$ if your lucky.

It does everything I need, its fast, and its user friendly. If I ever run into a problem, I generally find my answer in the Apple support forums. They're extremely helpful. As far as insurance its costly, I wouldn't go with anyone besides Applecare or Best Buy's geek squad. Other cheaper options available on other sites are not trustworthy to me, plus they make you ship your computer out of the country and you are usually left without for weeks. No thank you. Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac! If not, HPs are an awesome option as well, but consider lifespan and what type of user you are. Do your research!UPDATE:Still enjoying my Macbook Pro...considered trading for a newer model Macbook Air or Macbook pro w/retina. But after spending hours in the stores testing them out and reading reviews, I realized that although this model is older, it performs just as well as the newer models. The newer models are faster with downloading, but not a huge difference. I realized I would have to sacrifice features available on this model for thinness and faster downloading. Not worth the extra money I would have to spend and I'm comfortable knowing I could upgrade my 4GB ram to 8GB and my i5 to i7 whenever I want, if need be.  For me, this model works very very well and is not as heavy as it seems being compared to the Air or Macbook Pro Retina.

Debuting in the fall of 2008, it turned heads at coffee shops. It was the 15-inch Retina Display MacBook Pro of its time. No, it was better: it was the return, in a way, of the MacBook family to the more portable space once occupied by the 12-inch PowerBook G4.I digress because the looks of the 13-inch MacBook Pro haven't changed at all, really, since that fall. They haven't changed since last year, either. The 2012 MacBook Pro has newer third-gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, USB 3.0 ports, and better integrated graphics. That's it. The weight, the size, the battery life, and even the price remain the same. This is more of a spec bump than a new product. While the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is a little bit better than last year's 2011 model, the landscape for laptops is changing faster than ever.Windows laptops with similar components to the $1,199 13-inch Pro cost around $700. While the 13-inch Air has seen a price reduction, the Pro's continued status quo is all the more frustrating. Yes, the 13-inch Pro can be easily upgraded with more RAM or a larger hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD), and it has an optical drive and more ports, but it lacks the type of upgrades you'd expect on the higher, \"Pro\" end: no discrete graphics, no quad-core processor options, and no screen higher-res than 1,280x800 pixels.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Priced high and overheats A LOT", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Q7S9U943Q6E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Sleek and nice looking computer, however for the same price you could get a even more powerful computer.

Yes it is bigger, requires a little more time to startup but I believe that the keyboard and actually having a real working computer make up for those two things.  You use the pad on the computer instead of on the screen on the iPad but they seem to work exactly the same.  Try typing on an iPad and then on one of these computers.  No comparison.  Until screens are developed enough on iPads to allow for quick data entry they will never be more than a viewing machine.  Not that that is bad but it is limited.A word of advice, when installing hardware like a printer or additional monitor DO NOT use the disk that came with them.  I did for my epson printer and that required me to call epson and they had to help clear out what had been installed.

Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off. The problems only got worse: reformatted the system hard drive to try and fix the system and then it lost total ability to connect to the Internet.Thank goodness that I bought Applecare before the included warranty expired. So I brought it into the local Apple Store for repair. This was a mistake.After 14 days, and two separate trips, and even a phone call to support in between the first and second repair, I'm still not sure that they got it right. First they replaced the logic board and the second time the memory. In the last 4 days after the second repair the system froze with a tick-tick-tick sound until forced powered off.There was a large 4-day gap in the second repair when, after two unanswered calls to the store, the Store employee who finally answered my return call to them (which stated that they needed a call with my go-ahead) did not inform the original Apple store employee that I had authorized the go ahead, so the system sat not being repaired for 4 days until they called me again asking for the same authorization.Now I am wondering if the hard drive is bad and caused the OS corruption and not the RAM. I bet they didn't check this.I now believe that I cannot trust this system, nor the repair techs at the Apple Store that I took it into.I now want a replacement system, refurbished or new, since I've lost trust in this system now and have spent countless hours restoring from my backups. If this had been a work system, I would have been down for 14+ days.I loved my older MacBook Book Pro 15\" and it only needed a new logic board after 3+ years. This one was to be my dream replacement system and I am in no way confident that this will last 1/2 as long.Needless to day, I am really very disappointed in Apple. Poor customer service has really wrecked this experience for me. The only reason I am giving it above a 1 star is that when it works, the system is pretty awesome: fast, beautiful screen and physically perfectly sized.UPDATE 2/4/13: More problems surfaced since my last review. Video is now officially glitchy (white/random rectangles dancing across the screen before the screen goes black) and has joined a new problem: a 3-Beep (pause) 3-Beep (pause) repetition that occurs when coming out of sleep mode. This beep will not stop until the system is hard-powered down. Apparently, this has to do with a memory issue--like the RAM that they replaced at the Apple Store.I now have an escalation going with an Apple Care Senior Adviser, apparently higher than your standard Apple Care tech, who promised to fix this given the myriad of problems. At this rate, they will probably replace everything within the unibody shell before they simply give me even a refurbished replacement system.Update 2/28/13: after now weeks of remote analysis and reporting, and essentially nothing being fixed, I've now been authorized to mail in the system for repair (with promises that Apple will not let me be stuck with a non-working system). At this point, it is so unstable that I cannot even do a backup without the screen shuddering and then the system locking up completely. I'm resigned that the hard drive will need full replacement as well as the RAM, and that I will essentially need to rebuild the system (again) from the backups.

I have been wanting to switch from PCs to Mac/Apple for a LONG, LONG time because I HATE Bill Gates (but that's a separate issue!) with a PASSION and I absolutely despise Microsoft and Windows-based computers. Until I got this MacBook Pro, ALL the computers I've had were PCs going all the way back to Windows 3.1 in the early 90's. But, no matter what kind of computer I've had (whether laptops, desktops or netbooks) and regardless of the brand (whether HP, Acer, Toshiba, Dell, Gateway, or some generic brand), and no matter what Windows operating system it used (whether Windows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows XP or Windows Vista), I had nothing but problems with the PCs from day one, with constant screen freezing, computer crashes, incredible slowness, viruses, spyware/malware/adware (despite anti-virus protection and anti-spyware/malware/adware software) and other hassles, while, most, if not every Apple user I spoke to said how much easier and user-friendly that Mac was -- and my own experiences using Apple/Macintosh computers all through school from elementary school through high school, was further confirmation. However, although I'd been wanting to switch to Mac for the past several years, I hesitated because of the price. I couldn't really afford it, and although I mentioned to my family how much I wanted to switch from PC to Mac, I didn't want to ask them (since they usually give major electronic items like computers as their main Christmas gift) to spend $1,200+ for a MacBook instead of the $500 -$600 max that they'd otherwise spend on a PC computer bought at Black Friday \"door-buster\" sales. So for at least 3-4 years I kept using the same crappy Windows laptop, while looking long and hard and comparing different Macintosh models and dreaming of someday being able to switch -- which finally happened this past Black Friday, when Best Buy had a sale for the 13 inch MacBook Pro for under $1,000 (okay it was $999, but still under $1,000!) which my family got me for Christmas. I am so glad they did, because I absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my MacBook Pro!I am also VERY glad that my family got me THIS model, and NOT the Retina version, because the non-Retina MacBook Pro is the ONLY Apple/Mac product available now that still comes with an internal optical drive (although internal disc drives are not really a necessity with desktop models [like the Mac Mini or the iMac computers] that remain stationary and do not need to be carried around everywhere). Personally, I would MUCH rather have THIS MacBook Pro, and  I think its RIDICULOUS that the Retina version does not include an internal optical drive! Having no internal Blu-Ray in ANY of its products is bad enough but, especially, given the price-tag for MacBooks, lacking even a basic CD/DVD drive is ridiculous. Just because the greedy concept of \"planned obsolecence\" deems it necessary, does NOT mean that some of us are going to suddenly stop using and abandon/dispose of our dozens (if not hundreds!) of DVDs, CDs, cassette tapes and vinyl records, and just jump up to blindly embrace a disc-less and virtual future!I mean, although I only have probably about a half dozen or so Blu-Rays, I have HUNDREDS of CDs & DVDs (I lost count somewhere around 100, and wasn't 1/4 or even 1/8 of the way through the collection!) including both commercially-produced CDs & DVDs of music, movies & TV shows, as well as home-burned CDs and DVDs. I also have a few dozen vinyl records, and what seems like several hundred VHS videotapes, and audio-cassettes (either commercially-produced or purchased as blanks & painstakingly recorded personally) bought & collected, nearly all of which I still watch or listen to at one time or another. Many of us are not able to just jump like a jackrabbit from one latest technological craze to the next, from vinyl records and 8-tracks, to cassette tapes, to CDs and now to mp3s & iTunes, and from Betamax to VHS, to laser-discs to DVDs, to HD-DVDs, to Blu-Rays, and now to online video streaming. More importantly, not all of us are willing (or able to afford!) to suddenly replace our collections of music, movies and TV shows, recorded in a certain format, just because the technology has arbitrarily changed, often necessitating the re-purchase of that media in the new format. Which is why, even though I now DO have an mp3 player (which just got recently in the past year or two), an Apple TV (which I got from my brother this past Christmas) and a Sony television set with online streaming, I also still have & use not only a DVD player/recorder, but also a VCR, a 200 disc CD changer, a stereo with AM/FM radio & dual-cassette tape deck, and even a record player (a NEW Sony PS-LX250H Automatic Belt-Drive Turntable that I got a year or so ago) for vinyl LPs. Because its all videos or music which I enjoy watching or listening to, but yet, for the most part, I still don't like enough to waste money paying yet again to download it from iTunes (or other online streaming). Although it would probably be cheaper overall to just convert the music and videos to digital format on my own, it would probably take a lifetime to transfer everything -- and I'm not going to spend money to buy equipment to convert them to a format (like mp3) especially when, in a few years, it will likely just be deemed obsolete anyway!Which is another reason why I \u2661 my MacBook Pro! I LOVE that it includes an internal CD/DVD drive (and best of all, UNLIKE all my previous PC laptops, its NOT a bulky CD/DVD drawer, but rather just a sleek thin slot on one edge of the laptop). I'm almost always using my computer's CD/DVD drive to see movie or TV show DVDs or listen to CDs, and in my opinion having to carry additional components, like an external DVD drive totally defeats the purpose of even having a laptop (being a virtual replacement/equivalent to a desktop computer and yet also being portable enough to use it just holding it in one's hands while mobile!). Furthermore, its not like there's nothing available for those who want portable computing devices without optical drives. There ARE already more than enough options for them. They're called netbooks, iPads, iPad Minis, tablets, some kinds of Kindles, MacBook Airs, and even to a lesser degree, iPhones, smartphones and iPods -- and its one thing to make those without any disc drives because they are SUPPOSED to be ultra-portable, and CD/DVD drives would take up too much space & weight to keep them small and lightweight. But regular laptops are different, and what's the point of even having a laptop if a user is going to be bogged down having to lug around a bunch of other external peripherals like CD/DVD or Blu-Ray drives (as well as discs they want to play)  external hard drives & USB \"thumb\" jump storage drives, along with the requisite power cords/battery chargers................they may as well get a stationary desktop computer! UGH!!!! :\\In any case, the now-rare (since Apple have discontinued the internal optical drives in the 15 inch & 17 inch MacBooks and are planning to phase them out in the 13 inch ones) internal CD/DVD drive, is just one of the MANY things that I LOVE about my  Apple 13.3-Inch MacBook Pro. Even with only 4GB of RAM memory (though I'm considering buying a 16 GB of RAM memory \"upgrade\" from Crucial.com in the near future) this MacBook is LIGHTNING-FAST compared to any of the Windows computers I've ever had. Not only is it much faster, but Mac is far easier to use. For example, with every single one of the crappy Windows computers I've ever had, the screen/system would be freezing AT LEAST once or twice a day, if not more -- whereas in just the 4 or so months since Christmas that I've had this MacBook, I've only had like 1 incident of minor (far easier to handle than when the Windows PCs would freeze!) screen freezing, and even that was only when I was installing/updating some software so, in my opinion, the freezing was understandable -- and when I called Tech Support, Apple handled it so efficiently, that as soon as I spoke to them and did what they suggested, the computer was immediately unfrozen and I've had NO more problems since (though I don't even consider that particular incident a \"problem\")I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my MacBook Pro! The differences between this laptop and ANY & ALL of the Windows-based PCs I've had for the past 20+ years, is literally like NIGHT & DAY!Not only are Apple products much sleeker, and elegant-looking, but after experiencing first-hand how much faster and easier Mac OS is compared to Windows, I will NEVER, EVER buy a Windows-based PC or device again if I can help it! If only Bill Gates would spend more time trying to fix his bug-ridden, virus-plagued crap Windows PCs, and less time getting in bed with Monsanto & Merck and trying to pollute the planet and destroy mankind..........maybe then he'd be able to manufacture a quality product that, like Apple, is not vulnerable to every single virus and bug! There's a saying I heard from Apple users who said, \"Once you go Mac, you never go back!\", and its so true! After seeing how much better it is, I'm sticking with Mac and as long as I have any say it it, I'm NEVER, EVER, EVER going back to Windows!!Apple and Mac, ALL THE WAY, baby!!!!", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "UNRELIABLE", "Author": "Konstantin", "ReviewID": "R1WBYLZ0VZR9LW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was my first experience buying an apple computer.

Mainly bought a 15.4\" MacBook Pro as my older 13\" felt cramped for working with audio projects and using an external monitor often was getting tiring. With most storage products shifting to USB 3.0, I felt it was perfect timing to shop.Key highlight of owning a Mac is the iLife suite, iPhoto is still the leader of being a great photo album/management tool with some consumer friendly editing features, iMovie is the benchmark of easy to use video editing software and GarageBand went from being an audio recording platform for everyday users to adding more teaching lessons since '09. Out of the box you have a very nice ready to go creative machine.Hardware features:--15.4\" screen(non-high res) is still great, I prefer 16:10 displays over the squished 16:9 displays. While I'm not a fan of glossy screens the way Apple designed the glossy cover over the screen it keeps the backlight from bleeding vs makers who put a glossy coating onto the screen panel itself. Viewing angle on glossy vs non-glossy MacBook Pros is better than most notebooks on the market.--Processor, I know my review at this point is already \"old\" with Haswell(4th generation Core i) based computers reaching the market, Ivy Bridge(3rd Generation Core i) Quadcore easily crunches through encoding/decoding vs dual-core.--Graphics processor, this is the only reason you'll want a 15\" MacBook Pro/Retina MacBook Pro is the nVidia graphics as it can handle running software which are GPU dependent(animation, editing software and gaming). I can admit if you plan to do light gaming, consider using Boot Camp to run Windows 7 as you're able to use the newest/better nVidia graphics drivers--Apple only updates graphics drivers with software updates or new OS releases so performance can vary.--Bluetooth, in an era where most computers have this optional, Apple has always made this standard on their notebooks since 2004. Often I use this to sync my phone contacts/calendars/to do lists.--USB 3.0, this was my 2nd excuse to get a new Mac. Backups and transfering large projects via USB 3.0 is much faster than past Macs with USB 2.0.--Thunderbolt, at the moment you're either seeing PCIe expansion solutions for audio/video professionals or RAID storage products. With USB 3.0 being cheaper, I'm starting to worry this will fall into Firewire territory of only select groups of owners actually use it. Beyond highspeed, most users will use this for a 2nd monitor.--Firewire 800, looks like this could be the last Mac with it built-in based on the direction Apple is shifting towards. I use audio interfaces with Firewire so this is important. Older Mac owners may also still use FW400/800 external hard drives.--DVDRW Drive, some of us still use/need the drive and wasting bag space to carry one isn't ideal.Overall this is the only option for an aftermarket upgradable portable Mac. I didn't bother making notes on the memory/HDD as I cloned the HDD to a WD Black 750GB and installed 16GB of memory.

The exterior is absolutely gorgeous. The backlit keyboard is a great feature not to mention the key spacing makes typing so natural and easy. I also like how the rear apple logo stays lit while the laptop is on. When connected to Wi-Fi the Internet runs blazing fast and the screen quality is bright and crisp. Even after comparing this model with the MacBooks with retina display the little difference I saw didn't seem worth paying several hundred dollars more. 500GB is plenty of hard drive space for my needs and later on I might upgrade to 8GB of DDR3 memory but for now I'm very happy with its performance. I know some PC fans are hesitant to switch to a different operating system but honestly it's very easy to get used to especially if you've owned other Apple products in the past (i.e. iPhones, iPods etc...) The one and only thing I would change to match that of the PC laptops is on a MacBook tapping the touch pad does not serve as a \"click\" on a program. That's definitely a minor complaint so don't let my nit-pickyness discourage you. Sure MacBooks are a little pricey but take my word for it the investment is well worth it. These computers last on average 5-6 years which is way better than paying a little less and buying a PC laptop that is likely to break in a year.

I wanted the familiar Windows OS with the hardware the MBP had to offer, but initially ran into a few problems. I'll post the problems and their solutions that I discovered in case anyone else runs into similar problems.1. After installing the drivers for Windows, my webcam didn't work. It said that the drivers were not installed yet even after I downloaded the most recent driver package from Apple.Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple. My previous laptop had software preinstalled that controlled the webcam and added effects to it, and I erroneously thought that since my MBP didnt have this program that the webcam wasn't working. After installing the drivers my webcam actually worked fine with Facebook chat.2. The MBP got REALLY hot when running windows 7. This couldnt be good for the computer components, but also posed a fire risk.Solution: while on windows I installed a program called MacFan (just google it) that after typing in a few commands in the command prompt allowed me to turn up the fan speed indefinitely to significantly cool off the laptop. While in windows the fans aren't correctly utilized according to CPU usage so you'll have to do this process upon each startup. Just search on YouTube \"how to install macfan\" for thorough instructions.3. Videos on youtube while in windows do not expand fully to the screen, instead leaving black bars on the bottom and right sides.Still haven't solved this. I'd expect adjusting the screen resolution would have an effect but I haven't tried this yet.4. The battery life decreased from 7 hours to about 2.5 hours while on Windows.This couldn't be solved either. It's just how windows works on the Mac. The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.5. When I click an icon on the taskbar, its title flashes over it. (not the biggest deal but its annoying)Updated my Nvidia drivers from their website and it solved minor graphics problems.As for my actual review of the MacBook Pro, I am very satisfied. I run both windows 7 and mountain lion on it through bootcamp (helpful detailed instructions can be found on YouTube). That way I have the ability to run all my old games and programs on windows while having the Mac side to use for top notch picture and video editing, plus the App Store. I've always preferred the relative simplicity of Microsoft office 2007 for windows, so I use that.After adjusting trackpad and click settings on the windows side, navigation is easy and fluid. The separated keyboard buttons took some adjusting to but that's not any issue. The screen is bright, clear, and rich while the backlit keyboard helps for typing in dark environments.It's about 2 pounds lighter than my previous laptop and significantly thinner, and what I'd consider to be portable. Ill be using it at college next year and will report back on just how portable it is.Graphics, processing, and RAM are all lightning fast and should be useful in intensive software that ill be using. The only problem I've noticed is that after partitioning the hard drive, startup takes a little longer (around 22 seconds total).The power cord is portable and extendable, while its nice to still have the optical drive, Ethernet port, and card slot. Only having 2 USB ports so close in proximity is a minor issue with larger thumb drives, etc. but I may just purchase a separate hub.All in all, you won't regret buying this.

The battery lasts as advertised (give or take 15-20 minutes), and the entire user experience is very elegant. I like the little quirks of the latest operating system as well (full screen mode!). I had a Powerbook G4 11.6\" before, and that little beast lasted nearly 6 years (one battery change, RAM upgraded later), and the build quality on that computer was awesome. I mean I accidentally dropped it multiple times, had minor spills on the keyboard, and it still went strong. Finally, it was slowing down considerably last year, and the fan noise kept getting louder, so I was looking for a new laptop. I have always been a fan of Apple laptop's build quality, and the friendliness of the operating system. I am a proficient user of Windows as well, but I always find that the hardware manufacturers always let the operating system down. I compared the quality of Sony Vaio 15\" S series computer at a local Microsoft Store (with Signature), and though the prices for both the Mac and Sony Vaio were very similar, the overall computing experience was far superior on a Mac.I have used this computer for quite a while now, and this computer works very well. No glitches, no hang-ups - nothing but smoothness. I highly recommend this computer to any new buyer.

I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about. 6+ years later it's still working just fine, but with a limit of 2 gig of RAM, it was getting a bit slow and behind the times.It's nice to see Apple still making a laptop with a DVD/CD drive. The price from Amazon was GREAT, so, I had to order it. The buying experience was good. However my experience with UPS was a 0 on a scale of 0-10. The driver did not knock on my door, left a post it note notice. I went to UPS that night. The driver had checked in and they could not find the box. I was told it would be at Pick Up the next day. I went back the next day, they could not locate it, and discovered that it was on the truck. I missed the driver by 3 minutes. He did leave it with a neighbor, and if I had not found the driver who was exiting the apartment complex, i would have had no idea where he left it. Bad UPS, BAD.Anywho, back to the MacBook Pro. While the screen is not Retina, it is still superb. Far superior to my MacBook. The build quality is typical Apple, solid, solid, solid. The SuperDrive is quiet. Sound quality is very acceptable.I haven't had it long enough to test battery life, but I will assume that up to 7 hours is realistic.The Intel i7 processor and 8 gig of RAM makes this a great desktop replacement.Based on my time with the Black MacBook I decided to take out Apple Care. It did come in hand once way back when and more than paid for itself the first and only time I used it. By the way, the Black MacBook is still running strong. All I needed to do for it was replace the battery in February 2013 as it had swelled.The MacBook Pro may look pricy at first, but due to the build quality, parts used and it having an aluminum body, I can see this one lasting 7 years or more. In that light, the 13.3\" MacBook Pro is very reasonable in price and a winner in performance. And with Parallels 8 I am also using Windows 98SE, XP and 7 on my MacBook Pro. All run as if they were on a native Windows desktop machine. The 8 gig of RAM and the i7 processor make running virtual software a snap.

It's not upgradable either, but chances are if you're buying a Mac you won't be doing that anyway.The i7 processor on Apple's lightweight OS X is impressively fast for a laptop, and 8GB of RAM is more than enough for most uses. Mine had a 640GB hard drive and an optical drive that worked well enough.It's expensive, yes, but Macbooks are impressive systems even for this price. They're made from aluminum instead of plastic and are solidly built, and very compact. The i7 processor coupled with Nvidia's mobile graphics card is powerful enough to game on, BUT...the real deal-breaker for me with this Mac was its cooling. In favor of a sleek \"unibody\" design, Apple neglected to install proper cooling for the CPU or the graphics, with the only exhaust vent being behind the hinge of the laptop, and no intake vents anywhere. Fifteen minutes of Minecraft would easily get the CPU chip hot enough to boil water, and sometimes it would just crash. The lack of vents on the bottom makes chill mats/cooling pads a fruitless effort. The aluminum body absorbs some of the heat, but this is actually a bad thing, because it can easily get too hot to keep on your lap, and touching the bottom with bare skin could even cause minor burns.So I sold mine off.

I haven't found a MS based product that lasts as long and OSX is user-friendly and just works. Additionally, I saved about $50-75 plus no tax and free shipping. This model comes with 4GB memory, easily upgradable for minimal cost (I've read confirmed reviews of people successfully putting 16GB of memory in this laptop on newegg.com). You can also upgrade the HD for around $160, still significantly less than if you configured it that way from Apple.

I bought it because i wanted a portable DAW and i had some tax money left over.  Coming from windows was not an easy transition however. Macs are confusing as balls. You download something and it dissapears forever....until you find it. You try to drag a file to your desktop screen and all you've accomplished was creating two of that file. Which is terrible if your moving 34Mb raw audio files. Once i figured out how everything works (about a week) i found that working on a Mac is just waaaaaaay faster and more productive than working on windows. From the DAW perspective, Mac doesn't support VST format...so thats kind of an issue. Your plugins have to be AU format and theres not many of them out there. Sucks. But...this computer comes with iLife or whatever its called. Basically Garageband, and some photo and video editing software (dont care). Garagebands not bad. Its like a super dumbed down version of Logic, which is Mac only anyway, so probably a good place to start. It comes with pretty much everything you'll need to start recording. Got a guitar, and that rocksmith game? well, macbook pro recognizes that cable and you can record directly into your usb port into garageband. pretty cool. No driver install necessary...like on a windows computer, where you would need ASIO4ALL or something. Performance wise, its not the fastest laptop in the world...but theres an i7 core model that probably runs like lightning, and people are putting extra memory in these computers anyway. $100 from crucial.com. Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i've had it. it was right in the middle of recording tho, so that sucked. So far, only 1 hiccup, no viruses still got plenty of memory even with buttloads of plugins and software installed. runs smooth. 4 out of 5.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Machine!", "Author": "Ty's Mommy", "ReviewID": "R1J671FCSGYJLF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, let me say that while yes, I do prefer macs over pc- I have primarily been a PC user so I have plenty of past history.

The iMac is still functioning for the kids and still works great after 8 years. The issue is we can no longer upgrade to the newest version of OSX thus we don't get the benefits of the new features. The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months. Something we did often when we purchased Windows based laptops.Apple OSX is simple to use and has a more enjoyable and intuitive interface than the new Windows 8. I'm not saying it's for everyone but it's a great solution if you want a simple to use device that you know won't be at the end of it's life cycle in a couple of years.Pros-Great functionality-Integration with iCloud and many of the apps you use on an iPad and iPhone.-Log battery life even with wifi on and streaming movies via netflix-Very durable unibody case-Still has an optic drive-Mag Safe power cord is a nice touch-Intel i5 processor works very well-The chicklet keyboard is AWESOME!-The single best function is the backlit keyboard. There is nothing worse than trying to work on a plane and not being able to see the keys without an overhead light that blinds you.-The track pad is incredible. I'm a person that will not use a laptop without a mouse. I just don't like trackpad's because they never work right. That is until now. I can easily use the Apple Track Pad without any issues and now I don't even travel with a mouse. My bag just got a little lighter. I do however like the Apples Magic Mouse but I really don't need it.-It just works. We found that out when our new MBP found all the office and home printers, installed drivers and started working with no effort on our part.Cons-Heavy compared to Ultrabook laptopsRecommendations: I would definitely recommend 8 Gigabytes of RAM. Just because the processor is a 64bit architecture and can efficiently utilize the RAM. I wouldn't by the factory RAM just because it's expensive. Amazon has a nice selection of RAM from various suppliers that will work. We went with the Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory (CMSX8GX3M2A1600C9).If you have never installed RAM in a Mac Laptop go out on YouTube and watch a couple of videos.

The ones that overheated and died an early death. Also based on my past excellent experience with mac computers I did not purchase an extended warranty. My MacBook Pro died about a month ago and I almost did not get another one. Unfortunately I had become a mac addict because when a Mac works it works very well. My Windows based computers were always crashing, usually about every three months. The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up.My new Macbook Pro arrived yesterday. I normally DO NOT write a review until after I have used an item and on a computer I wait 3 months. I am breaking that rule today because there has been some IMPORTANT CHANGES that I feel people need to know about especially those folks like me who have had a bad experience with this line of macs.This Macbook Pro RUNS FAR COOLER than any mac I have ever owned EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NEW. This might be because of the new i5 processor. It might be because Apple re-engineered them and cured whatever it was that caused the problem. I don't know. All I know is that even my longest lasting macs always ran fairly warm and that 2010 model ran hot all the time. In my opinion this should make these new macs run far longer than the old ones especially if you get the solid state drive( I did not).This Macbook Pro has my other Macs beat on speed even when they were new.I will update this review and report any problems I come across. If you see no updates it's good news. One thing is for sure. With this Mac I am purchasing the extended warranty through Squaretrade. Apples warranty is too expensive and only runs 3 years.

The machine is brand new and it came installed with the Mountain Lion OS.The screen is excellent, it boots up fast. USB 3.0 is very fast. The trackpad works far better than I had anticipated. The gestures are amazing. The OS is very different than Windows, but is not hard to navigate. I store my regular 'Work in Process' documents on Dropbox, so those were a cinch to pull over. I still have to migrate my pictures and music to the machine. All of my bookmarks in Safari that I created over the years on the iPad pulled over seamlessly.

Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws. I love the little rubber seam that runs all the way around the edge of the screen that protects the screen from being scratched by the palm pads of the inner side. The keys are durable, and only start to wear out (become shiny) after about 1,000,000 hours of continuous use. I have another 2008 Black MacBook That has seen the most lengthy writing sessions with much sweating upon, and the keys still feel as good as new. I don't like the fact that the Screen is a fingerprint and dust magnet, but I fix that by wiping the screen down as a thing I do every Saturday Morning. The paint indicators on the side of the MacBook indicating which port is which has slowly become rubbed out from abrasion, but I know what port is now, so its ok. I wish I still had the paint in case I needed to sell it. The fan exhaust is located right under the screen hinge, and since it is easily covered, the laptop easily heats up. The trackpad is as smooth as velvet. I wish it was a entire button, so the trackpad wouldnt have to bend down when you press it at the top, but I've gotten used to the old way of thinking and using my thumb as a button-presser.Software:I can't say muchI love Macintosh. Grew up with it from OS 8I love how seamless and flawless it is. I can't wait for Mavericks, and I know it'll be a bestseller.I really love the fact that Mac has an app store with its constantly growing database, and great games.I wish iLife came hooked up to your account as soon as you enter your apple id with icloud so you can update it as part of your app collection, but since it doesnt cost that much, its coolHardware:Apple always has bleeding edge performance and I love their support of everything out thereMy Mac rarely ever lags, and even when it does, (unless the fan is blocked), the fan is almost unnoticeable. I've heard that they fixed the problem with the new Retina Display MacBook Pro though with the adjusted frequency fans.

The only downside was having to give up some older apps that don't run in Mountain Lion. But, I found newer versions or replacements made for the OS that are generally better.Externally, it is the same as my previous Aluminum MBP. Which is great because of the classic design. The design is simple and elegant. If you are a PC user, you might miss the lack of myriads of flashing lights and extra buttons. Besides being elegant, the MacBooks are durable. The previous iterations are all in the hands of family members and still going strong. If you don't have family members to hand down to, the market for used MacBooks is strong and can be sold to help cover the cost of future upgrades.If you are tethered to Windows, there are several options for installing Windows on your new MacBook Pro. So, you can have the best of both worlds in one computer. Yes, the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops.

Ram gets eaten up real quickly so either buy it with more ram or make room for extra cash and buy 8 or 16.Extra Thoughts:I also bought parallels 8 and windows 8. I will update my review when I install them.UPDATE:I have used it for some time now. This is not my first time using Mac. I enjoy the experience simply because it is not Windows, I hate the blue screen. I do use Windows 8 in Parallels 8, if I get the blue screen or it slows down I simply reset it via Parallels 8.

I am pleased with my decision, however I have only had this for a few weeks. There are a few things I am dissappointed with though. Only 2 USB ports. Most Windows laptops have 2 to 4 or more. No HDMI port. Most Windows laptops have at least 1. The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone. Not a big deal for me, but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac.

I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27\" iMac & while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers. The problem for me has been all with memory (ram) even with the ram maxed out on both computers I every once in a while have it lock up while editing photos (professional photographer) at first I thought aperture 3 was the problem, I switched over to Lightroom and there was a noticeable improvement but the problem remains. I have brought both in for service a number of times.- there was an issue with the seal on the monitor which caused dust to get under the screen- there was a problem with the screen refusing to wake from sleep modeEvery time apple handles the problem & fixes it for free. Apple products generally work out the small issues on their own, you only get problems when it's something big. Fortunately apples customer service is great.While I had my MacBook in for service I used my husbands HP laptop (similar specs) and there were many more quirks so overall I'm still happy with my purchase - apple still beats out windows/bios systems hands down but I would be lying if I said I wasn't concerned about the seemingly obvious decrease in quality over the years. I buy a new Mac every 2-3 years for work. With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs. I've never had a pc live longer than that.

I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple. There is nothing wrong in Dell but I preferred Apple 13.4\" Display 500 GB Hard Drive, 4 GB memory and Intel Core i5 Processor (3rd gen).. This is best laptop.Advantages:1. Although there  is a small learning curve for Mac OS to get some hands on - but as I am familiar with Linux I am very comfortable with Mac OS... this is the only thing I see difficult with Mac Book .... and this is advantage in other sense coz you will be amazingly in a new world of OS and features...... and even if you are too restricted to MS Windows, you still can have partitions and Windows installed virtually or through boot camp... with all native speed...2. Macs never crash... I never see any application taking too much to respond and going nasty ....and same applications I saw going goofy on my other laptop which carries Windows with similar hardware.3. There are no issues at all with internet security and virus attacks... I don't even have any anti-virus ...4. If you are restricted to Word processing applications like MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, you can have MS Office on Mac just in $119... but if you are not restricted but still want this capability, Open-office can solve all your problems...5. You can make Mac virtually same as Windows if you are Microsoft fan.... I am also Microsoft fan and doing the same....6. Incredible display, laptop size and weight.... great battery backup...7. accept trusted content only e.g. tools, software etc.8. No other brand has touch pad like Mac .... you don't even need lot of keys from keyboard or mouse when you have MacBook touch pad with youDisadvantages:1. Cost is more as compared to other brands. Other brands can come with higher configurations in same cost.... but Mac is Mac2. learning curve for OS and other features3. less free stuff compared to other communities... accept programs from trusted developers only", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Joe241", "Author": "Joe241", "ReviewID": "R3UU1BQ7QR5HGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this product for their exellent craftsmanship and fame of apple.

From 1988 to 2010 I was a graphic arts professional, electronically based on Macintosh computers, and a consultant to other such professionals in helping them deal with computers in their business. But when Apple walked away from supporting older software, some of which CANNOT be updated, by discontinuing Rosetta when they introduced their Lion operating system, I decided I would no longer purchase, support or recommend a Mac.Unfortunately my wife's 2009 MacBook Air developed a hardware problem that didn't seem worth repairing. I couldn't talk her out of another Mac, and very I'm sorry for that. This mac has been a problem since we got it. Even though it uses an I7 Intel processor, it is no faster and may be slower than the system it replaced. Startup times are incredibly long: over two minutes. This has to be because of software bloat from what I would argue is the worst MacOS since the original 128k mac introduced in 1984 (which I owned).Perhaps if you've never owned a computer, none of this would bother you, but if you come from an older mac or from the Windows side, the clunkiness and sloth will drive you nuts. In addition, of course, since pre-intel software is no longer supported, about 1/3 of my wife's programs were trashed. Some we could replace (the Office suite for $150 we didn't need because the version we had served her needs, but won't run on the new mac), while others have never and will never be updated. Fortunately we do have other older macs (Snow Leopard or earlier capable) so we can kludge.Recently however, this Macbook loses the ability to print to our network laser printer, a HP Color Laser Jet. The computer says it can't find the printer, even though it printed to it 10 minutes before, and other computers on the ethernet, both mac and windows, can also print to it. Given the way print spooling works the only reliable way to reestablish printing capability has been to trash the print que and create a new one. Sometimes this is possible through Bonjour (the Apple print protocol) or more likely it must be done via direct ip addressing, which in our local LAN with an address of 192.168.x.x, the computer thinks our printer is in Boise, Idaho! How stupid is that?By the way, when the print que is deleted to fix the printer, everything in that que is lost. Not a problem unless we were printing many pages from different web addresses which were sent to printer while we went on without keeping track. Rebuilding such a que is a pain.If you already have a Lion-based Mac, then getting this computer will not surprise you and you will probably find it very nice because you don't know any better. If you have an older mac, or a windows system, I strongly suggest you go to windows or stay there.

With such a machine, any audiophile or media person is practically assured of having a self-contained portable audio workstation, one that will record LPs, cassette tapes, FM broadcasts with a simple line (in my case, from an Onkyo receiver) to the \"Audio In\" of the machine, nothing else required.  Moreover, the presence of the two ports permits near-flawless capturing of any of the sounds emitted from a website or from the computer by attaching a simple patch cord between the two ports (I use an inexpensive splitter at the \"Audio Out\" port for monitoring purposes.  Finally, the built-in optical drive obviates the need to drag along an external drive, which can prove clumsy at best (taking up extra space on the desk) and mal-functioning at worst (I've never had a problem with an internal SuperDrive, but the external Apple Drives have failed with astonishing regularity, requiring all sorts of ingenious tricks to remove a stuck CD and often suffering damage in the process of removal).By contrast with this machine, the new iMac (and most of the other Macbooks) offers neither an optical drive nor an \"audio in\" port. Moreover, with the lack of an internal optical drive, I've forfeited two of the machine's USB ports--one to an interface; the other, to a burner--while attempting, with sporadic success, to import decent audio into the computer.  (At least, I've learned to purchase only external optical drives that have an eject button and a slide-out tray.  None of the non-Apple optical drives has presented so much as a single problem--and each has cost me under $50).I was among the first to purchase the unloved, scorned-upon Macbook Air back in 2008.  The first model had some costly problems (that problematic hinge!), but Apple withstood the flak (especially about the absence of an optical drive) and by 2010 came to market with not one but two Macbook Airs--an 11\" and  13\".  The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing.  Unfortunately, what was once regarded as an aberration, then a curiosity, and finally a respected member of the Apple family, has now, it would appear, become the \"prototype\" for all Apple models.  I would expect the machine you're looking at to be the last Apple machine to come with the 3 features mentioned above.This may be a transitional time in Apple's history, one leading, moreover, to another consumer computing revolution and to a roaring comeback in Apple's stock price.  If people increasingly find CDs useless--even in their music collections--and if makers of ancillary products begin to show more products that might benefit from the added speed of US 3.0 and Thunderbolt (which is close to being all that remains of Apple connectivity apart from \"the Cloud\"), Apple could win big--really big.  But in the meantime, consumers who purchase, for example, a new iMac can only be left scratching their heads about how to make use of all those super-fast ports (USB 3 and Thunderbolt) on the back of their new machines, however ahead of the curve they may be.  At this point, the iMac has become less about practicality than bragging rights (\"look guys, mine has a Fusion Drive--just take my word for it\").", "Date": "March 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rating product", "Author": "Monica Ardon", "ReviewID": "RJFRJI8AZFI8S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i consider rating the product because it's not a simple thing to buy online and in different conditions fromother stores....i took an aim and it was great. the computer is in excellent shape and its new!!!! good review from me!!!!", "Date": "March 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought this to replace a 2006 Macbook Pro", "Author": "Eric Chang", "ReviewID": "R2YRZQ0ROTEJ78", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Had to replace my old Macbook Pro not due to defect, but was rather unexpectedly smashed to pieces from a fall.I enjoy the speedier processor and better battery life, although I think 7 hours is a bit optimistic.

I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice. I also like I have the option to push calendars, photos, and contacts to an iPad, iPod Touch, or iPhone (if I had any of those).The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though \"Home Sharing\" (I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer) but I could not figure that out. I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music (losing my ratings). I would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their iOS products, though there are cheaper options; any new computer users, as it is easy to learn; and anyone who needs to be efficient, as the gestures make it very easy to multitask.

Apple makes a fine product but, I have had very bad luck with them, and they are simply over priced.  For me, If this computer ran fast, stable and efficiently, it would have been worth the cost.  However, this has not been my experience so I am returning this product.I first purchased my macbook off of amazon and it ran glitchy out of the box.  The trackpad was erratic and unstable and programs crashed out of the box.  I contacted apple who gave me the typical line \"well, you have to buy it directly from us to be sure it is good\".  So I sent back my macbook and went through all the trouble of getting a return.  I purchased a new macbook at the inflated apple cost and got my second computer.  I soon realized that I was having more problems that were related to the operating system.  For one thing, I bought this computer to edit movies.  iMovie was a laughably bad program which was non-intuitive and hard to learn.  I shelled out the money to buy Adobe Premier which is an awesome program that I was able to figure out without seeking help.  Unfortunately, this particular program runs very glitchy on a mac.... but wait, I thought these computers were supposed to run these type of programs better than a PC.On top of that there is a massive learning curve when you are switching over from a PC to a Mac.  I don't care was Apple says, Macs are NOT more intuitive then PC's... especially when organizing files.  I ended up spending hours on the phone with apple care to learn how to perform system functions that should be intuitive enough to figure out on my own.  Now, don't get me wrong... this is NOT apple's fault.  Macs are different from PC's and they take time to learn.  However, what IS apple's fault is that they only give you a 14day return window when you order a 1500+ product from them.  This is insulting and unacceptable and is the main reason why I am sending back my second Macbook.  If I was given a more appropriate return window, I likely would have stuck with it but apple is twisting my arm to return it while I can still get my money back.So in the end, here is my final point.  Apple makes a fine product.  However, it has been my experience that shelling out the big bucks for this product DOES NOT GUARANTEE that you are going to escape the headaches of dealing with a PC.  My experience was that I had spent three times as much for buy a product that included the same headaches as a PC if not more.  Keep this in mind when you are purchasing one.  In the end, I think it is better to buy this product from amazon because they actually have a BETTER return policy than Apple themselves.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not happy", "Author": "Tina Shuemake", "ReviewID": "REA39C19IG9SB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After one week the main board fried - I guess this happens, but not often.

A laptop provides easy access to Internet resources and keeping track of assignments that need to be due. Many modern homework assignments require using Internet or having to do research for classes. The Apple 13-inch MacBook Pro laptop is very practical for college students because of its easy to use features, fast performance, and new modern design. Often homework assignments require using a computer, which the MacBook Pro assists with because it provides Internet that can give information for research. In my opinion, Safari, the Internet browser that comes with the MacBook Pro is very fast and is extremely easy to use. As a result of having user-friendly features, Safari has a top sites page that contains frequently used websites. Also, in addition to top sites, there is unified smart search field that takes you right to the web page and fills in the entire URL when you enter a web address. MacBook's built-in sharing feature provides access to various web pages without having to leave Safari. By just clicking the Share button, you can choose how to send a web page by using Mail, which then gives you four options. Also the MacBook Pro has a fast performance that helps college students complete their work. The MacBook Pro provides many features, such as a dual-core Intel Core i5 that allows users to be able to take their laptops on the go. Also it has a 22-nanometer processor, cache, and graphics processor, and a fast 1600MHz memory controller on a single chip. Also applications like Aperture and Final Cut Pro help make work go smoother and faster because they automatically increase the speed of the active cores up to 3.7GHz. Hyper-threading technology allows two threads to run at the same time on each core and can get more jobs done. In addition to its high-quality features, it has an amazing new modern design that adds to the MacBook's overall easy usage. The new design contributes to assisting college students in need of getting work done because of its LED backlight technology that makes the display continuously bright. Also, on top of the screen is the built-in FaceTime HD camera that can be used to talk face to face through the laptop to loved ones or friends. The multi-touch trackpad is the button itself, which results in more room to click everywhere, which personally is nice because it is easier to double click when needed. Another valuable feature of design is the MagSafe Power Adapter's magnetic design, which is made to disconnect harmlessly from the port in case someone trips over the wire so it does not cause the laptop to fall. In conclusion, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is a wise investment for college students and any users interested in an easy-to-use productive laptop to help get work done. Having a portable computer is beneficial because it provides a place to store various information. Students looking for an all-in-one tool that can assist them in numerous aspects should definitely look into the Apple MacBook Pro laptop line. Its easy to use features, quick performance, and sleek design all contribute to the MacBook's overall productivity.", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "The product is perfect the delivery was SLOW.", "Author": "Patti Graves", "ReviewID": "R24XLSI2XXXY1D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had my reservations about ordering online but I'm using it to write this now and I couldn't be happier.

I come from the high-end Windows laptop user base; my previous laptop was a Dell XPS. I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem. If you are considering switching from a Windows computer, do it. I have no regrets. OS X is simply amazing, and while there is a learning curve if you're coming from another OS, it's easy as pie to understand. Everything just works on a Mac. WIth the exception of some games- but with Boot Camp you can install Windows on any Mac. And this MacBook looks as good as it performs. Simple details, crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops. This computer exceeds my expectations in almost every category.My only issues with the laptop are as follows:1) It looks beautiful. Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily. You're better off buying a case alongside the purchase of your mac. A keyboard cover also wouldn't hurt. A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.2) There is no HDMI port. This is an issue for me, as I frequently connect my computer to my television. But there is a simple solution; purchase a mini-displayport to HDMI adapter.3) The sound on this laptop is severely lacking. On my previous XPS (and other mid-range laptops) sound really wasn't an issue. But with this laptop, the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny. My solution to this was to purchase Boom by Global Delight ([...]). Boom is a software application that adds sort of system wide equalizer to the Mac, thus affecting all outgoing sounds. It's a good fix, in my opinion. I have it set up to bass boost all the time, and the music comes out sounding decent, if not SLIGHTLY tinny (MUCH less tinny than before).So there you have it. And if price is a concern, you're really paying for build quality.

I was finally done with high school and moving on to bigger and better things. All my life I had been striving for the best and getting my first laptop was not going to be anything short of the best. After my graduation party and selling my car, I finally saved enough money to purchase my first `real' life purchase. I knew I wanted a MacBook Pro since early senior year and now was the time that I was finally going to get it! I begged my mom to come with me to Best Buy to help me buy it. She didn't see the need to come with so I brought my sister. Checking and double checking that I had the right amount of money in my checking account I told the sales woman that I'd like to buy a MacBook Pro 13 inch. She gladly went to the back to get it and without hesitation I swiped my debit card. A screen popped up asking if I wanted to purchase insurance. Being the 18-year-old kid with only a new laptop on my mind, I stupidly said no thanks. After signing my life savings away, I walked/ran out of the store carrying my new `baby', just as the store was closing for the night. Getting home I opened the box and started to set-up and install all of the new and coolest things on my computer. At around 12:30 that night, after convincing my mom that Macs never had any problems and they were the best laptops around, my laptop completely shut down. It was charging so I knew the battery was fine, but it still wouldn't turn back on. Reluctantly I walked downstairs with tears forming in my eyes. How would I tell my mom that it wasn't working. After spending what seemed like days on her laptop searching what could be wrong, we decided to call the Apple helpline. They were dumbfounded, just as we were. They said that we must have gotten the `lemon' and that I should not have any problems returning it tomorrow for a new one. It was the longest night of my life. Waking up at the crack of dawn, we exchanged the `lemon' for a new one, as well as bought the highest amount of insurance possible. I've now had it for almost a year and have not had any problems with it. If I had to choose a MacBook over a windows laptop, I would still pick the MacBook hands down even with the small mishap in the beginning. I definitely think that the saying of `good things happen to those who wait,' truly applies to me, if I waited rather than being rash, I would have had no problems with my `baby.'", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "apple sauce", "Author": "Wayne", "ReviewID": "R31JOVA8DKMAEV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had 2 mac book pro's and they both froze up.

An application I've been running on Wine in Ubuntu does not run on OSX. There's Virtualbox but not VMWare player. My favorite desktop editor Geany is not available on OSX and a lot of the better text editors are expensive.

Could not even get it past the set-up stage.  I called Apple Care to try and troubleshoot it with them, and they were totally boggled about it.

It Did Get Better ~ But Really, Not Worth the Price", "Author": "Nu Mantra", "ReviewID": "R2ESY0I0FFOVTD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So where do I begin so that the legions of Apple critics and fans do not view this as support of their narrow views? I will say that I am not into the Windows vs. OSX argument - I do not think Apple is evil nor that they have, hands downs, the best products. I have had Windows desktops and one laptop - and yes - I had the typical problems with them that are often used as reasons for one jumping ship to Apple.I had said that my next notebook would be an Apple, but never really wanted to pay Apple's steep price. OPEN BOX is the way to go - I got 10% off a returned MacBook that looks to have never been used - the power cords had not even been unwrapped. Then - as a student and an educator - I was able to get another $100 off the price. Still, at nearly a grand after taxes, the cost was pretty steep when BB had PCs with similar or better specs for half the price.So, why stick with this? I want to find out for myself if this is worth the price and the hype.  I already knew that Apple's customer service is great, and that alone is worth maybe $150. I do very little on my comp - read the news, write some papers, watch a movie, play chess at Yahoo!, so I do not need it to be a power machine, I simply need it to work. And it does, very well, in fact. Processes are seamless -There is great integration of things like the email client, the Apple store, and iTunes - of which I have NEVER been a fan. I avoid iTunes on my iPhone at all cost - I use Media Monkey instead - But I can see how valuable it is on the notebook. I love how even the websites  and files can be viewed in cover flow.  Apple thinks of \"little\" but important things like using a charger that is magnetically help in place, so that if you trip on the wire, it disconnects, instead of sending your expensive computer crashing to the floor.  And the fact that I can dual boot was a big selling point, if only so that I do not have to spend $100 to get Microsoft Word, which I will need once I start school again in a few weeks.I have had my MacBook for exactly two weeks, and  I do enjoy it when I can use it, but I have not yet decided if I will keep it. This is because the thing gets so unbearably hot, that it becomes too uncomfortable to use. My first day with this, I set it up, started playing chess through the included app -I was not even online - and within ten minutes, I thought the machine would burn a hole in my pants! I turned it off and ran to my desktop to do some research. And wow - what did I find!Yeah - yeah - I get that Apple says the MacBook should not be used on laps- I get that I should go into Activity Monitor and quit programs that have high CPU - which are NONE - as I am doing very little on the thing in the first place. Yeah - I get that all of the Apple fans out there have this way and that way - some of it costing extra money - to try to help make my computing experience on the MB a more enjoyable one. But this is an experience I should have right out of the box! What other company makes a computer at this price that you cannot use for ten minutes without fearing you will suffer a burn? Now, before the fans come out and say, \"Take it back, yours is defective,\" I will remind you that this problem has been documented all over the Internet. I do not want to hear I should update to Mountain Lion. I have already done the research, and  some are complaining that their MacBook is running even hotter after the update. A co-worker of mine told me that he had a student bring a MacBook to him that had a battery so swollen that the chassis had separated by about 4 inches. Then I thought back to my own iPhone, which had to be replaced in January because of the same expanding battery issue; it split my phone's casing right down the back!How Apple sells these products (with consistent-enough overheating and battery problems) and gets the accolades they do is beyond me. Maybe it is because, other than these very serious flaws, they pioneer very good and exciting technology. You have the fans who will accept any ole shortcoming to remain loyal to what they think is a superior product. Then perhaps there are others who are in my situation, who for the most part really enjoy this MacBook and would love to spend more time learning and using it, but who experience discomfort in just trying to use it for basic computer tasks. This puts me on the fence, as I try to find solutions that do not require my having to dip into my pocket any more to use a computer that simply should not run this hot, especially at this price! If you do not mind the heat and/or are dedicated to spending more money to cool the MacBook, I say go for it.  Even if you are not, but you have been thinking of taking the Apple plunge, I say try the MacBook out for yourself so that you can come to your own conclusion about the overall quality and worthiness of  the MacBook.  As for me, I remain hopeful and very disappointed at the same time.  I soon have to make a decision about returning it, but I have to admit that I really like this machine so much now that the cost bothers me less and less everyday, but that heat... that is a whole different story!UPDATE -10/29/12After taking the comp in and meeting with the folks at Apple, the heating problem has simply resolved itself.  As someone on the Apple forums suggested it would, it just stopped heating up so much and so quickly.  For two months I have used the Mac - and for the most part have liked it.  However, it certainly is not worth this much money, not my money!  The novelty and mystique of the great Mac Book has worn off!There is just too much clicking I have to do to for basic functions like  minimizing a screen and finding files.  What takes 1 click on a Windows computer takes 2 on the Mac Book, what takes 2 on a Windows machine takes 3 on the Mac Book.  Sorry, but it DOES crash, and it crashes as much as any Windows machine I have ever used.  I do not like being forced to use iTunes.  If I had known beforehand that I could not download and use Media Monkey on this, I would not have bought this laptop.  I should be able to decide on the media management software that I want to use.  iTunes is not even very intuitive; rip a CD that is a compilation, and iTunes will not even rip it as ONE CD, rather as a different CD per different artist, and then you have to go in and correct all of the tags so iTunes can properly catalogue your music in its library, and then you have to tell the program to go back and find album art?  Who has time for this? Freeware is a whole lot easier and enjoyable to use, and allows you to use MY music the way I want to!  The Mac Book has stopped being fun for me, and I do not see what it has/does so much more/better than a PC to justify paying twice the price for half the specs of a Windows machine.I have not yet decided if I will sell it; this will be determined by how much I end up paying for a Windows laptop.  With Black Friday coming up, I should be able to get a good price, but if I end up paying more than $500, I will sell the Mac Book.  Never thought I would say that I am looking forward to buying a Windows machine, but Windows 8 is very enticing, at the moment.  The very good thing is that Apple products have great resale value, and my machine is only a few months old and is great cosmetic condition, as well as I have the latest Windows suite installed on it, so I should get a good price for it, if I do sell it.", "Date": "August 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too early for Screen problems", "Author": "TD", "ReviewID": "RO6G2HGJNOLPN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i bought this item recently, i havent used it much yesterday when i switched on my macbook pro it attempts to start up i see the white screen, hear the sound, can feel the fans are onthe screen just goes to hibenate and doesnt come on for me to sign on to my mac. after a while it comes on and i am using it playing musicand the screen suddenly hibernates, music is still playing but i have no visual.for an item i havent used much and for what it cost, its too early to start giving problems", "Date": "August 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bricked after 2ft drop on carpet from bedside.", "Author": "Deimos \".\"", "ReviewID": "R34QRUOZQ1CK6O", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At the title says my pro (which I had running wonderfully with Windows 7 as primary OS as OSX was way to limited) fell off my bed (the cat rubbed against it and pushed it off) and it landed on the carpet.

Hunt \"Enjoying\"", "ReviewID": "R1DNRUOVUA4NJM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've owned a bunch of Macs over the last four years, switching over after 20 or so years of PCs. Initially, I loved my 13\" Macbook Pro and vowed never to go back to PCs. With my new 15\" Macbook Pro, I still won't go back to PCs and in general I really like my Mac, but I no longer love it. I have the new 2012 edition with 750 MB hard drive and 8 GB of RAM. It's quite fast but doesn't seem any where near as fast as it should be based on its rated speed. RAM should not be an issue with 8 GB but it regularly runs out and I have to use 3rd party software to free up RAM, whether I'm editing photos in iPhoto or Aperture or running Final Cut Pro X. It seems that Apple should by now have figured out how to cycle RAM in a way that constantly frees up older allocations and keeps space open for applications being used currently. Seriously.Most egregiously, I'm really pissed off with how computer makers consistently lie about battery life. The 2012 MacBook, as with the few generations before it, advertises a 7 or so hour life under normal use. I find this unconscionably off the mark. My Macs have NEVER lasted more than three hours on one charge under even light usage (Word, web, etc.), and generally last about 2 hours new. This is so far from seven hours I don't know how it's legal to advertise seven hours.Conclusion: I like my Mac (and I really like my Mac desktop), but I expect a lot more from Apple nowadays. Three stars out of five. And I'd appreciate any tips (beyond the obvious) for increasing battery life or managing RAM.Update 10/6: I forgot to add that it gets REALLY hot, to the point where I can't hold it on my lap. This is far hotter than any previous MacBook or Air that I have had has gotten. Even the palmrest gets really hot. This is a major defect that I can't believe Apple allowed.Update 10/20: I've changed this review to two stars because this new allegedly lightning fast MacBook is simply not fast. In fact, it's pretty damn slow and gets hung a lot. It's also started crashing entirely, which has never happened in any of my prior Macs. Crashed twice today in editing with FCP X and I had to force re-boot with the power key. Really disappointed in this purchase.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible!

Not only was it referbrished/used, but I was paying so much more than a brand new apple macbook pro would of cost. Got ripped off too. Yeah. I should've looked into that more, but I was right out of high school, so I didn't know much. And let's just say my old macbook pro is hunk piece of junk. Everything that went wrong with it did which I won't get too much into, but I wanted a replacement. PC laptops, I wasn't too crazy about, so I decided to go with an updated version of the Macbook Pro.I had to decide between the this and the Retina Display. I wanted the Retina Display one so bad. I think I wanted it mainly because it is thinner than the regular macbook pro, but did I really want to pay $400 more just for that. It did have other features, yes, but I won't pay $1400 for a laptop. I would do a $1000 for a brand new one though. Getting it in the mail is like Christmas! ALl packaged up securely and when I opened it, it was perfect.I had a 4-5 year old macbook pro. So there were some pretty big changes that I am still getting use to. The trackpad is a little confusing, it scrolls in opposite directions and you can click anyway in there. I think that's the biggest thing I have to use to. It is smaller in size, like weight like, I'm talking about. Love the black keyboard with the lighting. Finally I have photo booth again! I missed it. I am still basically messing around with it, but I remain in love with it.I have had my ups and downs with Apple products in the past, but honestly apple remains to be the best in my opinion.

Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.

However this new model (which may be similar to the i5 series CPU) runs cool and more constant.

Ill need to play with it more before i can really say more.

Owning everything Apple owns, and having my older macbook side by side, and my new Mac Air beside it as well, and after endless adjustments in brightness and contrast, there is no doubt the screen used on the macbook pro non-retina is inferior to my MacAir and macbook.Apple uses Samsung and LG on their monitors on the same model, both in the Retina MBP and non-retina, but they dont advertise this fact. As of 3/19/2013 Apple is being sued over the 'secret' that MBP retina use either LG or Samsung, but you dont know which one youre getting until you notice bad ghosting on the screen (which is the LG problem, not found on the Samsung). Its sad that you 'roll the dice' on WHO made your monitor on two MBP exact same model and mfg. date. That is something Apple should've known would soon rear its head like a snake in the night.Foremostly I must comment that I own Apple stock, and own tons of their products and sing their praises to no end, as such I am not an 'apple hater' by any stretch. I am shocked at how fuzzy, and flat the screen is on this MBP, and wonder WHO made the monitor on this laptop, since you never know, and Apple isnt saying, and they wont tell you, nor is it indicated on the box WHO made the monitor, since Apple uses multiple suppliers for the SAME MAC models.I am returning this unit for a refund, the screen is rather painful to read and type on, ...and since I use 7 different computers, I am not 'addicted to one type of screen', and am adjusted to many, ...but this unit is painfully unbearable.Side by side, believe it or not, BUT TRUE, the speakers on my Mac Air crank out crisper and MUCH LOUDER at full on same tunes than this MBP does. This isnt subjective or conjecture is rock hard FACT. You would think just the opposite on the larger MBP, but thats a fact.Another minus is the squishy jello-keyboard touch, a really undesirable (generally to most who hate this) feature.Ive read a lot of INSANE comments by others rebuking others saying \"my mac air is better than this MBP\". Well heres two empirical facts, all the upgrades money can buy: SSD, mem, etc, WILL NOT change the 'stink-factor' of the screen on this MBP, or the squishy keyboard, OR the inferior speaker output.Yes, the optical drive is nice (no bluray, shame on apple for po-pooing optical drives), and the ethernet, but the mac air is about as lite as an ipad and does 90% of what this Mac Pro does,...so the math is simple.The only negative against this unit is the same as ALL Apple computers, that being Apple is insanely stingy on memory. There is not any Apple product that doesnt immediately need a Mem upgrade. Given the extremely high price of all Apple laptops etc, the pathetic lack of memory is morbidly sad.Barring the horribly bad screen, and nasty squishy keyboard feedback, the unit is fast and well built, but for its price, etc, the mac air is far far moreso a desirable product.

Scroll a couple more times and it happens AGAIN.  This is f'ing maddening.  What's even more maddening is that this has been forced upon us with no option to turn it off!  I've called Applecare about it multiple times now and I'm told it's a \"design feature.\"  WELL IT SUCKS!  Supposedly it's to mimic how an iPhone works?  I don't know, as I don't own an iPhone--but I do know one thing!  I DON'T WANT MY LAPTOP ACTING LIKE A F'ING IPHONE!!!--Rubber-banding effect on webpages.  This is where the webpage (or folder, etc) will stretch beyond its boundaries and then \"snap back.\"  Now this wouldn't be a big deal if the rubber-banding only occurred on the tops and bottoms of webpages, but Apple has also decided to implement it on the SIDES of webpages.  This causes webpages to slip and slide all over the f'ing place, making it extremely annoying when trying to read text while scrolling!  Again, no way to turn this \"design feature\" off!--Apple has also decided to change all the trackpad gestures, and not for the better.  AGAIN!!!!  No ability to revert them back to what they were in Snow Leopard.  Seriously--how hard would it be for Apple to simple offer an option to use the older, more familiar settings for these sorts of things?

Second let me say not really.I hate it so much I wouldn't even give it to you if I hated you.First I wiped this device and installed a clean version. Then I updated. You know the low cost updates Apple puts out. Seriously I had to leave it running overnight on the update.It has been nothing but problems. Every update breaks something and not I am not kidding. Mostly they break their own tools or apps.I updated the software on a clean install, then update iTunes, cool yeah. Wrong.  iTunes needs quicktime version blah blah error starts popping up. Only that version is installed and I'm not using iTunes.Then I update the OS to the newest version only to see its killed Cisco VPN permanently. I don't mean the client I mean it removed the parameters in networking to allow connections. And it broke the web version of Cisco Anyconnect which you have to buy and its not cheap. My Apple support friends at Boeing have asked me how I fixed it. I look on websites forApple and they are dumber than crowbars so I happen to see a 64 bit mentioned and I decide to search for a Cisco 64 bit client and install it. Works again only I am running 32bit OSX nice. Then I try to update again to the best yet from Apple low and behold I'm told to buy it from the store. Only I have to have the newer version to download from the store. Apple intellect at its best.After a phone call and some money I have a cd on the way.  I install the next version, setup a printer, setup office, configure email, and install a couple other items nothing major though.Installed updates 1GB worth and bam the printer is dead. Of course on windows you can delete, or change/view the network settings, and reinstall in a minute. On a mac you need another 1.5 GB install. The cool thing is how you download the installer and it expands it and moves the files to various other locations. Sheer genius to take a download file, extract it to a .pkg file, then scatter files all over the hard drive so you cant possibly just go back to the download location to reinstall.  Now I suppose their is some script I could run but I can't even find the install using Apple guidelines from the OS. Not even using the help from from forums.Anyone that says a mac is easy is lying. Every update you run the prospect of losing hardware settings, programs you bought may no longer work, and you might even have a paper weight.The issues I have had are not hardware problems. I installed another harddrive, installed Windows XP and no issues, wiped it and installed windows 7 and both were faster and more stable.If all your going to do is browse the web and use iTunes you might be okay other than that they are junk. I have built a non standard Windows 2008 server on a Dell desktop and had to hack network card drivers and it runs fine, wiped a virus off a kids pc, did a complete reinstall of Vista without drivers on an older pc and spent less time than on this mac. I have had it two months and its been used about 12 times,  I have ins talled windows XP\\windows 3.1\\95\\95\\windows 7 and updated thousands of times and even the worst pc I have had, has never given me this much grief. This is the reason MS sold 60 million copies of XP, over 60 million copies of Windows 7 and Apple has sold 3 million mountain lion operating systems. And Apple charges $15 and Windows charges between $100-$300 per copy.If you buy a new computer every 3-6 months Apple is for you. The first couple updates will render it a paper weight and then you can get a new one and they will give you an $8 trade in credit too! As for the folks at the store helping you I would say yes they will if you forgot how to plug it in. If it involves tech support you better hope you have some good diagnostic skills. I usedto think I did before I got this mac.I got this laptop for troubleshooting and to become familiar so I could assist others. It has taken more research than my degree and let me tell you it certainly has help me learn how to troubleshoot macs.Now I know why few vendors make software for macs. It's not because Mac doesn't license them its because of poor/incomplete development at Apple.", "Date": "October 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "in the apple store", "Author": "waiting", "ReviewID": "R1UHBEV3B6VTFC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My family an I are waiting for service in the apple store now.

Complete folly!  The bad experience started at the Apple Store.  I was told they could transfer data for me if I brought in my XPS.  \"For how long?,\" I asked.  \"Several days.\"  \"Not acceptable.  I have work to do.  What if I brought the two folders I want to transfer on an external drive?\"  \"Fine.\"  So I went home, updated the folders and came back.  \"Oh, we can only transfer from another computer, not from a drive.\"  So I purchased the computer and went home to set up and transfer data myself; I've never had any problems doing this in the past.  I get home again and go to archive and print-out my email receipt (which I need for an expense account).  The pdf would not open because of special Apple character sets and was just lines of splotches.  I went back a third time to the store to get a receipt.  The next day I opened the box and proceeded to set up.  After about an hour trying to work out how to assemble the two-piece power chord (no instructions) I got stuck on the data transfer stage; it could not recognize any connection to another computer or hard drive or flash drive.  I just decided I hated it and returned it for refund.  I remembered all my previous bad experiences with Apple: how terrible ITunes is, Apple library terminals on which it was impossible to back-page or scroll, and several lecturers I've seen humiliated because they brought their slide-show on an Apple, so could not connect to a digital projector (which apparently requires a mythical object called a \"dongle\" which no human has ever seen).  I have nothing good to say about Windows, but at least I've learned since the PC was invented to use its various iterations, and it can send emails, text, pdfs to other computers and be hooked up to a projector.

The new MacBook 2.3ghz - 15.4\" is fine as laptop computers go. I don't need the \"Retina\" model and would never buy one. My display is almost too bright and sharp as it is. The display is beautiful even without \"Retina\". The MacBook Pro Retina display models also eliminate the DL-DVD player/burner, the Ethernet connection and the FW800 port. All three are options I use almost every day!! Why would I pay more for less!!Of course, the 500 Gig 5400 disc is too slow for music production and 4 Gigs of RAM had to be updated to 8 gigs of RAM. Apple, really!! You couldn't give consumers another $35.00 of RAM, which would have provided the 8 gigs instead of 4 gigs? This is really petty on the part of Apple. A high performance computer should come with extra RAM when it's so inexpensive. At least I can replace the Hard Drive and RAM, which you can't do with the \"Retina\" MacBook Pro.My real complaint is with Amazons bate & switch game. You go to buy a computer and Amazon is listing that laptop for almost full price. So, they show you others that are a little less expensive. Which one will you buy? You'll buy the cheapest one available when they're the same (brand new) MacBook Pro computer. Once I made my purchase for $1789.00 for the MacBook Pro, Amazon lowered their price down to $1709.00 for the exact same computer. When I called Amazon about getting a price guarantee, the call center representative said, \"Sorry, you didn't buy your computer from Amazon, and regardless, Amazon has NEVER had a price guarantee.\" Well I'm sorry, I did buy my computer from Amazon, with an Amazon credit card. The transaction was done on the Amazon website, with an Amazon vendor. Every consumer based store in America has a price guarantee for at least 30 days from the time of purchase, but not Amazon!!I hope it's worth it to Amazon that they've lost a customer for life and thousands of dollars of purchases over the next few years because of their petty business practices.

Granted The Mac Book Pro looks cool and trendy. But once I got to practical day to day use, I started feeling frustrated with it. Here are my findings after 4 months of intensive use. I am a software programmer who runs multiple virtual machines at the same time and use my computers at their peak.1. Mac OS Lion is a bloated piece of software. It takes more than 5 minutes to reboot the system. And it takes as much orsome times more to shutdown the system. Sometimes it even refuses to shutdown. It seems something is going on with iTunesand AppStore that prevents it from shutting down. My only recourse was to hard reset through power off and on.I had to reboot many times because the Mac Book Pro's performance degraded with time.2. The heat dissipating shell is a real bad idea for a high performance laptop. I have to rest my lower end of palms on thelaptop for typing. There is no other way unless one is stationary and set with external mouse and keyboard.Since it gets so hot in that area, my wrists started getting hot and I felt pain in the arms. I had to wear mitts to insulate my palms from the heat.3. Wireless connectivity.
