The14 \" screen it is the sort of computer that you can work at all day. It is like a modern version of the 15.6\", the term refined comes to mind.  The interactive screen is a nice treat and works very well. Under the hood the i5 processor is more then capable and the quality and brightness of the screen is better then OK. What struck me most is the quality of the Asus s400. This is not a piece of plastic with brains but a well thought out, well engineered chassis. It is streaks ahead of the competition. From the keyboard to the design it just feels like very special right out of the box. I think Mac have met their match on this one. Well done Asus!", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00G3UZX76"}}
