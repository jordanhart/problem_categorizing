{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It is what it is", "Author": "George C. \"GCIII\"", "ReviewID": "R1C1AYKV18OI1N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a netbook, not a notebook or laptop computer. If you want the power of a good laptop that's what you should get. If you want a very convenient way to web surf, check e-mail, tweet and use Facebook, this nifty little netbook will do fine.Lightweight, easy to use and set up, my netbook operates perfectly and is very handy for use when in a hurry. I have not tested the battery life but it seems to last longer than a normal laptop. I'd guess a good 6 hours, but not 11 as some ads might state.Videos, like YouTube, are slightly \"jumpy\" because a computer this small does not have a dedicated video card. Again, if you are looking for the features of a top line laptop you should not get this netbook. Video playback is decent, just not HD or as smooth as a notebook or desktop can give you. I would not use this computer for streaming video or graphics editing. Also, remember the screen is very small and you may need to use a little \"zoom\" or enlarge the fonts to see some forms of text. Sound quality is definitely lacking through the built in speaker. If you need loud volume you won't get it from this netbook. I have not tried headphones or external speakers but I'd assume they provide decent sound. The built in speaker is good enough if you are in a quiet room or have very little distracting noise, but you cannot crank the volume up enough to overcome all forms of distractions. Look elsewhere if built in speaker sound is of high importance. I've used this computer as a bedside \"radio\" to listen to the BBC and World Radio Network online while falling asleep. It does a good job of that. As you can imagine, that means I've set up the computer on my home wireless network and that was a snap. All in all this computer does just what you'd expect for its size and processing power. If you are looking for a NETbook this is the one to get. If you are looking for the power of a good laptop get that instead.", "Date": "July 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "netbook", "Author": "nwuser", "ReviewID": "R38EMMSIRA3PX1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this netbook in good time. I am realy pleased with  it albiet one  thing I was  displeased  with  was  that the battery is  not as  advertised.  I get 8 hours.  I  dont know if you can get a bigger battery or if it was misrepresented.  It is really small and light with a good keyboard.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Asus EEE", "Author": "David A.

It handles W7 with no problem and the hybrid engine gives me to  \"instant on\" capabilities.  I haven't tried the battery life yet but I use it primarily plugged.  The keyboard is no problem either because the key pads are large even though the layout is condensed compared to a standard keyboard.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great netbook!!!", "Author": "Enic", "ReviewID": "R1M6TZOBVTCGF9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price, great performance, and I love the long battery life.

Ok but Win7 is a dog compared to the XP based 1005HA.  Should have put the money towards an iPad as I expected to be able to upgrade to Win8 as I hoped Windows 8 would be optimized for tablets and Netbooks.  According to Asus not upgradable \"due to Cedar Trail chipset is not supporting upgrade to Windows 8\".Still a good Netbook, I knew going in win7 was drag on the system but expected to upgrade to Win 8.This will be my last Windows based PC - iPad and Mac in my future now.", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": ":-(", "Author": "Rhia R.

When I received it it was very slow and did not work well at all.  I contacted them to return it but I was told once it was opened it could not be returned, which makes no sense since I had to open it to see if it worked as expected.  They would not take it and they have my $400 and I have a worthless netbook.  Their policy is very unfair to the buyer so be warned!  Not going to shop with them again.Unfortunately Amazon did not help me resolve this issue either.  I am disappointed in this whole process and I am now out $400 for a product that did not work as advertised.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice", "Author": "Elaine M. Bell", "ReviewID": "R19KZ7BWHJMAU5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It's small but has the room for lots of stuff.  It's not the fastest, but it gets the job done.  It won't take Windows 8 because of the graphics, so you will have to settle for Windows 7.  The keyboard is OK, but not good for a real typist...too small.  More for the one-fingered typist.  Lightweight.  Battery lasts a good 6-8 hours and recharges rather quickly.  Nice price too.  If you want a portable netbook with lots of disk space and decent processing power, you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than a tablet", "Author": "DougH", "ReviewID": "R2AC9SOMMD5HND", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was told that netbooks like this were a thing of the past, replaced by tablets, but I needed to do spreadsheets and email on the fly, and I didn't want to store all of my data on the cloud. This little thing does the biz I need done, and gives me close to 8 hours of battery life in doing so. I wish my old laptop would have quit a year ago. Lots of hard drive, able to multi task, streams videos reasonably well. Sound is a little soft on it's own, so I need to plug it into the stereo or headphones occasionally. Neat tool for me.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Size is right on!", "Author": "Swartzie", "ReviewID": "RX7J2D1O27BTO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The size is perfect for putting in the camper and taking on road trips. One issue I have is it seems the memory is small. I'm no computer person but after a while, my web browsing slows to a crawl so I need to go in and dump all temp files and such then it works fine. I wasn't expecting the tip top of quality but it's actually super nice. Couple this computer with a 20\" LED monitor, a wireless keyboard, and a wireless mouse and you have one bad*** computer setup (like mine) for under $500.", "Date": "June 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great netbook", "Author": "Jan Wade", "ReviewID": "R3IIFG1AE9L55R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you know what you need then you can find it.
