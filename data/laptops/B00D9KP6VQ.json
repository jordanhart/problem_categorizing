Omine \"Shunten\"", "ReviewID": "R1V5I11UNM0RD1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased from BLINQ through Amazon.I was looking for a laptop that's not too heavy, and not too bulky with a screen size of 15.3\" ~ 15.6\".  Also, I didn't want to spend much money on it because it's going to be carried around with me outdoors.  This was it!  The funny thing is that this laptop has a numeric keypad, but there's no way to keep the Num Lock locked on boot.  There's no section for that in the CMOS settings, either.  However, I did figure out a way to keep it on by changing the registry value for the keyboard.Another thing I noticed is that the fan kept spinning faster and louder like a hair dryer and kept spinning forever.  Apparently, this is quite common on Dell laptops.  Yes, but it's not normal.  What's really weird was that, I was planning on swapping the RAM out with a bigger one, but, it wasn't quite compatible, so, I sent it back for another type that's identical to the original, except, with bigger memory  size.  So, I had to put the original memory back in for the mean time and what I noticed is that the fan problem was  fixed!  I guess these Dell laptops have a glitch in the memory that affects the fan.  Now I'm very happy with this purchase.The video memory on this system is a mere 32MB.  It shares from the RAM for a total of 1792MB.  This is why I've decided to upgrade the memory to the max of 16GB just for the peace of mind.This laptop is my initiation into the world of the funky Windows 8, now, upgraded to 8.1.  Very funky, indeed.A little side note on Windows 8.1: Be forewarned, 8.1 comes with Internet Explorer 11 and cannot go back to IE10 without going back to Windows 8.  IE11 is fast and fluid, but there are some Java application that will not run until Oracle or Microsoft comes up with an update.  I had to install Google Chrome to access my personal cloud drive from remote location because it uses Java.Also, when upgraded to Windows 8.1,  IE11 comes with the Enhanced Protection Mode turned on by default.  This renders many add-ons and software installation difficult to install.  Some pages will not even display.  This feature should be turned off in the IE11 \"advanced options\" menu.  I believe the retail version of the 8.1 comes with this feature turned off by default.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good laptop, affordable price", "Author": "Cornelia Jones", "ReviewID": "RJ76GOL82I4QS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop a few months back, because I was starting school and I needed something inexpensive, but reliable.

The package arrived on time and the laptop works great! Set up was easy and the handy quick start guide was helpful.

I also uninstalled the trial MS Office software and installed MS Office Professional Plus 2010, which I have as a licensed copy.You can remove any of the preloaded apps and put in your own apps.Windows 8 takes a little bit of getting used to, but other than that it works ok.I would like to thank the seller for such an excellent product, at a remarkably cheap price of $324.My recommendation - get it if you want it~!", "Date": "October 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell Inspiron 15", "Author": "Ricky T.

Though everything seems to be working as you would expect from a lower end PC model, the fan at certain points begins to sound like a hairdryer. It was so loud at the Library the librarian told me I had to go downstairs because my computer fan was making so much noise. It is a good temporary computer for people who know they are saving for a better computer. Though for a main computer it would be a struggle to have to deal with all the quirks. The build quality is what you expect from Dell. It feels as if you could break it at any given time. Though you always need your battery charger with you. The battery rivals an I-phone with one full battery charge. It would be safe to call this a portable desktop instead of a laptop since you need the cord all the time.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome computer!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2XQC5ODXMR864", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has worked from the first time I turned on and is able to perform all functions that I need.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good buy", "Author": "Derrilen C.
