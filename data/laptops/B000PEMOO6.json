Being a college student it was imperative that I find something cheap but good. And the fact that I was able to find a Mac at such a low price still amazes me. I got mine today and it works like a dream! You can surf the web incredibly fast. Save alot of music, plays dvd's nice and crisp. Wireless is very simple and easily acessible.

Don't know where they got them from, and how they are able to sell them for so cheap. I hope they didn't fall off the back of a truck. (Just Kidding.) I'm very impressed, though. I've been a Mac user for 8 years. This is just another example of Macs great craftsmanship. I would suggest this Mac to anyone who wants to have everything and be up-to-date in the Mac world without paying $1,2000 and up. There's only a few minor suggestions I have: download the newest software after installing Mac OS X Tiger (It costs about a $100 bucks.), google search Firefox and install it, and go to apple.com and search in the support section for this Mac, iBook G4, so you can get the user's manual. That's about it, and it will be running like you paid $1,400 for it.And where are the blemishes!!??? I didn't see any. Awesome deal, awesome Mac.

You can use it to check email, facebook, and casual web-surfing--just as long as you don't want to watch videos (llke on YouTube or forwarded email)--And it is definitely not for \"gamers\".I would not say that at $200 it is \"overpriced,\" but don't expect to be making movies and skyping.", "Date": "May 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "RETURNED - THESE WERE AWFUL!!!!", "Author": "Jennifer J.
