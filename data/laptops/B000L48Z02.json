{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fantastic laptop", "Author": "Guy in Fredericksburg, VA", "ReviewID": "R38B20LPI092Z1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop.  First, let me say, I'm a software developer, so I'm very particular about my computers.  I was in the market for a new laptop.  After a lot of shopping around, I went with a laptop from HP for around $700.  It was my first PC with Vista, and it was frustratingly slow.  Here's an example... Put your laptop into sleep mode.  Come out of sleep mode, and how long does it take to connect to your WiFi network?  The HP laptop would take about 45 seconds while the macbook takes less than 5 seconds.  It's a small detail, but it's the tip of the iceberg.So, after I purchased my HP laptop, my wife bought a macbook.  I was so impressed, I took mine back and got my own macbook.  The battery is great.  I haven't timed it yet, but it's easily over three hours.  The LCD is great.  You don't get all that bloatware that comes with a new PC (like antivirus software that you can't seem to delete) that fills up your new hard disk.  And, there's no need to even worry about antivirus software since 99.9% of viruses are designed for Windows.As for performance, these macbooks are plenty zippy.  And, yes dual core does make a difference.  If you like to multitask (browse the web while playing mp3 music), then you'll notice the difference.  The user interface is more responsive during heavy loading.  Just for fun, I took a program I wrote for work and ran it on my new macbook.  (I won't bore you with the details of what it does, but it's CPU intensive.)  On the HP laptop, the program took about 13 minutes to run.  On the macbook, it took 3 min, 30 seconds.  Just for fun, I ran the same program on a fully loaded Dell 820 ($3000), and it finished in about 3 minutes.  So, I'm very pleased with the performance of this macbook.And, there are great open source (free) applications you can get for Mac OS X now.  So, I quickly installed Firefox, Thunderbird (email), NeoOffice (MS Office replacement), Chicken of the Sea (VNC client), XAMPP (Apache/PHP/MySQL), Transmission (BitTorrent), Burn (CD/DVD burner), and Eclipse (Java development).The only way they could improve this macbook would be to bundle the DVD writer in the entry-level model instead of a combo drive (CD writer, DVD reader).  It's not an issue with me since I have many other DVD writers on my LAN, but others may want to purchase the next model up that comes with the DVD writer.", "Date": "August 30, 2007"}, {"Title": "Its worth it", "Author": "Ben", "ReviewID": "R16U5SI0QZXQ4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Mac computer as well, after many years of using Windows PC at home and at work. I'm very impressed with both Macbook and OS X. Macbook, performance is awesome with just 1g of ram memory.From the first time Mac user, I'm very pleased with Apple hardware and software, it just works. And I'm impressed with how it all works together.As for this specific version of the macbook, I have found no problems at all, works beautifully as advertised. The only thing I found is that mabook's screen needs to be calibrated or adjusted. Don't settle for default screen profile, pictures will appear washed out. Calibrate screens settings; you should be able to get it pretty close to what it should be with just what macbook has in OS X.I also recommend buying this model, since it has a bigger harddrive, its worth it. This laptop is very fast and reliable!", "Date": "May 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "If it's been two years, this one is worth the plunge.--UPDATE. (Extend the warranty)", "Author": "Samuel Chell", "ReviewID": "R821ZWCA6TXB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "[UPDATE: Written 18 months after the review below: Compared to my iBook this machine proved better built (on the outside), maintained a tighter-action keyboard, was noticeably faster--for 15 months, at which point the hard drive simply, suddenly, and unexpectedly, died.]  It's predecessor, the iBook, on the other hand, developed problems like letters disappearing from the keys of the keyboard along with the keyboard action becoming sloppy, loose, and chattery.  I'd rather replace a keyboard than a hard-drive any day, but I probably got my money's worth out of both machines (Apple's least expensive models).  If I had to do it again, I'd order the extended warranty plan with any Apple laptop.  It's expensive, and it's not guarantee (if Apple judges the damage due to the user's incorrect or inappropriate use of the machine), but if it's a laptop and it sees heavy use, the two extra years are probably worth the several hundred extra. (With desktop models I'm still inclined not to buy the extended warranty.)}I ordered my last small-screen iBook from Amazon just two summers ago.  As usual, my heavy touch started shorting out the keyboard, and I couldn't afford several weeks of down time.  Factor in the wait, the cost of repairs, and the improvements, and this 13\" MacBook from Amazon seemed the best way to go.It's about a hundred bucks more than the prior edition but worth it.  The screen is wider, sharper and brighter (though I had no complaints with the predecessor).  The speed of unloading internet pages is noticeably faster,  a time-saver. The magnetically attached power cord should save the user the cost of an Apple adapter or two (about $80 each time you snap the thin wire).  The keyboard area is larger, which is nice, though the different feel of the tracking area and right thumb-click (little play--it barely seems to go down) takes a bit of getting used to.I didn't need a built-in camera or remote control, but what can you do.  At least I was able to avoid the Superdrive (haven't found much use for DVD burning) and all the extras (and sales tax) they push if you buy from Apple Store.  This machine doesn't require any additional memory or RAM, unless you're a heavy duty movie editor/audio engineer.  It's a one-click purchase. I even took a pass on Apple's current iPod incentive (I still buy CDs, mostly from Amazon).Even as I type this review, I'm conscious that the keyboard has a tighter feel and is quieter than the previous model. It also gets around in the often cumbersome and sluggish MS Word more quickly than the comparable machine of only two years ago. A great little work horse, and the transfer of information from your old computer has never been easier (make sure you have a firewire cable handy).", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Fast and Zippy", "Author": "Andy \"Andy\"", "ReviewID": "R3KFBUPAMQRE3Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I will try to give a unbiased and responsible review of this MacBook. As a college student I struggled with the decision between purchasing a Windows laptop or a MacBook, but due to all the horror stories out there about Vista imcompatibility and my previous Windows nightmares, I decided to give Mac a try. I don't regret it. The screen is glossy and beautiful, albeit the 13.3\" screen can make the font in programs (especially in instant messaging programs) a bit small. You can adjust the font to larger size in, say,  AIM, but then that would render the person you are talking to to receive ridiculously large font sizes from you as well. And, if you are new to MAC OSX, there is definitely a learning curve and an experimental phase, so you should be patient; fortunately, there are alot of MAC OSX tutorial sites on the web and resources as well. I love the fast fast FAST boot time (around 20 seconds!!!) from off to on. BRAVO!! And the 2.0 ghz processor is more than enough for me. The MacBook is also very very silent. One thing I don't like though is the mouse track pad. Even on the fastest sensitivity setting, it just doesn't keep up with my fingers. A bit annoying, but a problem that can be solved with an external USB mouse. Let's see how my MacBook holds up in the next four years.", "Date": "May 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "As a poweruser, I love this mac!", "Author": "Michael A.

Recent issues with Vista and increasing problems with run-time bloat, incredibly long startup times, malware, and endless updates with their associated mandatory and automatic reboots began to get me thinking about checking out the Mac again.  Particularly with my iPod and iPhone showing me how superior Apple products could be compared to the competition.So I bit the bullet and purchased my first Macintosh laptop, the new MacBook with glossy screen, dual core Intel processor, and a gig of RAM.  For the most part, the laptop has been a pure joy to use, is built with amazing solidity, and does what it's advertised to do.  However, since I use computers of all kinds all day, I have racked up a number of pros and cons for this mostly stellar new laptop product as I've used this MacBook (in gorgeous matte executive black) the last three weeks on a daily basis.PROS:- Amazingly fast boot time, about 20-30 seconds in my tests. Wayyy better than Windows.- Extremely solid construction and feel.- Elegant and compact power cord setup with the famous magnetic detach system to prevent annoying and damaging cord yanks.- Comes with lots of software and apps that really work.- Roomy storage and good overall performance.- Does not run too hot, even when performance settings are turned up.- Supports Bluetooth 2.0 and a lot of the newer, sexier Bluetooth profiles including A2DP and stereo headsets.- Big, bright, clear screen.- The built-in camera takes decent video and it works well with Skype.- With Parallels, runs Windows Vista Ultimate flawlessly so far, even with old apps, simultaneously with the Mac OS.- The feel of the latest Mac desktop seems brawny yet nimble with lots of seductive graphics, morphing windows, flip screens and more.  Makes it a joy visually.- Battery life is acceptable, not finding myself wanting a lot more juice frequently (though occasionally I do.)- Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection works surprisingly well to control and use Windows PC's remotely, a genuine pleasure since I usually work with 2-4 computers at a time, and I can just Alt-Tab between them from the MacBook.CONS:- User interaction often seems weirdly sluggish with a brief, unexplained pause when many common actions are initiated in applications.  Not significantly off putting, but strange for a system with two powerful CPU cores.- WiFi seems slow and inconsistent.  Not a lot of dropped connections, but slower for sure than my PC laptops.- Bluetooth stereo support is crude, with no automatic switching between internal and wireless speakers/mics.- The leading Mac apps (iLife, iWork, Mac Office) just aren't as stable as their Windows counterparts.  Not a lot less stable, but definitely noticeable and sometimes frustrating.- The trackpad and associated button feels heavy and ponderous and is tedious to use for long periods.  Definitely invest in the wireless Mac mouse for serious work, it works well.- Irritating sharp beveled edge on front of the case where your wrists rest.  All edges on the MacBook are smooth except for the one which you rest your wrists.  Careful placement and angling of MacBook can help, but seems inexplicable in terms of good design.- Screen has slightly uneven lighting, not enough to bother but Sony laptops run rings around the MacBook in terms of mind-blowing clarity and lighting consistency.- No extended battery available from Apple (that I know of), not good for serious business users.- No built-in WWAN support, had to buy something from Verizon that hangs off the side, another knock on business use of this product.- 1 GB RAM is not enough for serious daily use, I had to upgrade to 2GB to get things to work right, particularly with Parallels.For lighter family use, the current MacBook is more than ready for almost any computing task.  For serious business use, the MacBook is just barely there and requires some additional investment (mouse, WWAN, extra battery, Parallels) but that's true of many Windows laptops as well.One star is subtracted from a perfect score for the strange design shortfalls (average Bluetooth support, sharp edge on the front of the case, so-so trackpad, less than great app stability, less than zippy response of apps.)I would recommend this product to almost anyone however, the Macintosh has re-arrived on the personal computing scene for sure.  I hope you enjoy it!", "Date": "August 21, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great for everything.... but not for spreadsheets", "Author": "CKE", "ReviewID": "R1RMLEFQFG4F0G", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I guess all Apple reviews eventually become a comparison between PCs and Windows to the virtues of Macs.  Most of us really only have these two options.... we can look at RAM, memory, processor speed and a variety of other indicators - but to be honest what characteristics really matters? Hopefully, this review can help make this as painless as possible for the non-tech savvy (The power users already have their preferences). By the way, I use both PCs and Macs during the course of the day, so I will give my opinion on the strengths and weaknesses.Apple - Strengths-  The Apple goes from \"off\" to \"surfing the internet\" in 15 seconds. It is truly amazing how fast it gets booted-up and ready to run.-  Video editing is a breeze - lots of power here.- Lack of viruses ...there are some... but not nearly as many as Windows based computers...an added benefit is that you don't have use \"Norton\" or \"McAfee\" and all of the annoying pop-ups that those programs provide.- Ichat... my wife is able to have a picture perfect video conference with her sister every night...even though they live 2500 miles a part. The best part? It is free!- Apple support is top-notch! You make an appointment at a store and they bend over backwards to help you! This is sooo much better than calling into some random help desk.- Quality of construction - sorry, I have had to many PCs die from hardware related issues over the last 5 years... Apple's seem to last forever.Apple - Weaknesses-Spreadsheets - It is true you can get a Mac version of Excel - but it is absolutely horrible. Things that you take for granted on Windows based Excel...i.e adding a comment in a cell are missing!- You can not buy (at least at the time of this review) music and videos on Amazon.com - they do not support Macs at this time.- Lack of programs in general. While there are many cool programs and games for PCs there are only a handful available for the Mac.- Attaching photos to email is not as easy as using a PC and Yahoo.- a 13.3\" monitor really is too small.My final recommendation? If you have to have ONE computer you probably want to strongly consider a PC. The  variety of programs and the power of spreadsheets have become critical to most of us.... especially for our jobs. However, if you need a computer simply for \"fun\" (not counting games) and surfing the internet the Apple is impossible to beat.If you need a computer for work or Video Games = PC/windowsIf you need a compuer for surfing the internet/photos/videos = Apple/MacOS", "Date": "September 14, 2007"}, {"Title": "Great little notebook", "Author": "Chones", "ReviewID": "RYU88B7LP26H7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Macbook (MB) for about two weeks now and I have to say I love it, and I'll tell you why:1) Ease of use.  After you get over the PC to Mac unfamiliarity (it took me a day or so), you'll realize that everything on this MB is so much more user friendly than any PC/Notebook I've ever used.  For example, deleting items/programs off the computer.  There is no need to uninstall...just drag the item to the trash and bingo, the program is gone.  There is no registry in OS X to deal with.  Wireless connectivity is a breeze - just walk into a hotspot and a little window pops up asking if you want to connect.  That simple!  My previous laptop - Dell Insipiron - took some windows configuration which if you're new to wireless connectivity could take awhile to get used to.  Bluetooth comes standard and any device is automatically detected.  I have a BT mouse that I just turned on and the MB took care of the rest.  It was that easy -- so far I haven't had to deal with drivers and updating and the like.2. Security -- I am still a litle wary about this aspect of the MB, but no anti-virus software!  I have not yet (knock on wood) encountered any spyware/viruses whereas in PC, that is the first thing you have to contend with.  That is not to say Macs are not vunerable, but much less so than PCs from what I've read.3. It is sleek, light, and great looking.  Aesthetics aren't too important to me, but it is a plus.  The MB looks great and works well.  Not to mention its 1\" all around size.  It is slightly heavy, a little over 5lbs with the adapter.  Fits nicely in my school bag -- not much heavier than a 5 star notebook with about the same dimensions.4. Little things.  So you can probably get more functionality/customizibality from a Dell for at or just under the price of this MB.  But what the Dell probably won't offer is the little things. For example, the AC adapter comes in two parts - one much like the IPod adapter with two prongs for travel and then a three pronged extension when using at home.  The fast connectivity of this MB - I never have to turn it off/restart, I just close the lid and the its goes to sleep.  When I open the lid, the computer starts right up and picks up where I left off in seconds.  On that note, the use of magnets for the lid closure and power cord connector -- that is ingenious!  No latch to break, no hard cable connection to send your MB flying from the careless, unaware college kid. Installing applications -- just download app, an icon appears on your desktop, drag it to your applications folder and you are done.  There are many more little things that I could mention, but this review is turning out too long as it is.Bottom line:  I am very happy with this MB.  It is my first Apple Computer, and when my Dell XPS dies, I intend on replacing it with an Apple PC.  They just seem so much more user friendly.  I am not a computer whiz and the Mac seems to target the average user like me.  I love every aspect about this MB from the size, weight, design, to its functionality.  Switching from PC to MAC is really not that difficult and if you get stuck, just google whatever it is you need and someone somewhere has probably had the same question.  Most of the stuff is common sense.  Unlike some other users, I don't think the MB gets overly hot on my lap after many hours of usage.  The keyboard is flat and takes a bit of getting used to, but I love it.All in all, well worth the price.  I bought mine off the Apple store, used the student discount ($100 off), got a free IPOD.  Granted you cannot upgrade much on this machine (I got a larger HDD), so it won't replace a regular computer for gaming or serious graphic design.  If you want more value for your money - you're probably better off with something like a Dell.  But if you have the money (although it's not overpriced for compared to other notebooks in its class), and want a well thought out, nicely built machine - with very little headaches that are associated with PCs, you should get this MB.

This is my second Mac laptop, replacing an original iBook from 1999, which is still working fine but can't accommodate enough RAM for OS X and things like Photoshop. The MacBook is lighter, boots up in record time (faster than the iBook and my work PC), and I love the glossy screen. OK, I do sort of miss the handle--no matter what people said about the iBook, that handle is helpful when you live in a house full of butterfingers.No complaints about battery life--I keep AirPort turned off when I'm not online--and I work in some pretty battery-draining programs, like iMovie, InDesign, and Photoshop. The MacBook handles them all with ease, and the big hard drive means I can keep multiple projects onboard and still have plenty of working room.Love Spotlight (the search widget) and Dashboard--my inner Steve Jobs really hates all sorts of aliases cluttering up my desktop and impinging on my wallpaper. Dashboard has a calculator and a dictionary/thesaurus for my son, and boatloads of free widgets are available at apple.com for the publishing geek (font management, project timers, etc.)Being somewhat new to OS X and using Windows XP at work, I wasn't sure how Tiger would handle cross-platform files, but I've imported wav and avi files and iTunes and iMovie read them without needing additional software for translation. If I want Windows on the MacBook, I can use BootCamp to have it run native, which would be a vast improvement over the adequate-but-slow PC emulation I had on the iBook under Virtual PC. Because I'd only need Windows to run spreadsheet software for hubby, I'm hoping iWork07 has the long-awaited spreadsheet program.Hooking the MacBook up to my ancient peripherals was a snap. Drivers for my 8-year-old inkjet printer were native to OS 10.4, and I was able to download free OS X drivers for my 8-year-old scanner and 15-year-old laserprinter.I'm very happy with my MacBook.

Long \"la la la\"", "ReviewID": "R1PJUTZWBQDMTN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is intended for current PC users who is thinking about getting a MacBook. I'll just point out some of the issues I have faced.I have been a PC user for 7 years. I'm using this MacBook for my college, and I have been using it for only a month.(Please be gentle, I will update my review later if anything changes)First thing that really bothers me is the battery life. I travel quite often, so battery life is a big deal to me. This MacBook claimed to have up to 6 hours of battery life, which is a lie!. In real life, it only last around 3 hours. Even I turned off bluetooth, wireless, dim the the screen, I might be lucky to get around 3.5 hours. If you run Macbook under Windows mode, the battery life drop to 2.5 hours. The only way you can get your macbook run for up to 6 hours is dimming your screen to darkest, not running any applications, and turning off wireless & bluetooth..Don't believe me? Go to different forums and search battery topics. My last laptop claimed to have up to 5 hours of battery life, which it did last around 4--5 hours even after 2 years.  If your previous laptop only have 1 or 2 hours of battery life, I guess 3 hours will be a little bit \"upgrade\" for you. On top of the short battery life, this macbook battery can get very hot, you can burn your lap if you put it there long enough.There are good things about Macbook. It is very easy to upgrade and install the memories. It only cost me around $60 to upgrade to 2GB ram, and I installed it very easily without much of an effort. The same configuration, Sony could easily cost around $2000, and macbook only cost $1300.I have always wanted a MacBook, because it is cute and stylish, but the Mac OS system always make me hesitated. I finally got it after I found out it also run windows now. It is very easy to install windows on MacBook with bootcamp. They suggest you to print out the instructions, which is not necessary, all you need to do is follow the instructions on screen.If you get used to using windows softwares, you will find many of them have very limited functions when under Mac OS, and sometimes they don't even have Mac version.The bootcamp I used was 1.3, it does have some incompatibility issues.The volume and brightness control keys, disk eject keys are not working under windows. I hope all these problems will be fixed in the future. Since there is no right click button, you have to use two fingers tap on the touch pad and click as right click. Some new MacBook users might have problems in the beginning.It is not hard to learn the Mac OS, and there are many great programs are specially designed for Mac. The office 2004 for Mac is great for college student, one of the function is you can record the lecture while you are typing down the notes.I strongly recommend this laptop. It works just like a regular laptop, but it can run in both of the world. :-PPS: the white macbook does get dirty easily, get Glass Plus Wipes, it will do the trick to make your laptop look new again.

It wrote at 3.4 MB/s instead of the 3.6 MB/s (which is 24x) so that is close enough.  I assume the top speed is under \"ideal conditions\" anyway and my hard drive was 3/4 full.  6x is more like 0.9 MB/s.  The manufacturer specs do say that the DVD read speed is 8x (from Apple:  Slot-loading Combo drive (DVD-ROM/CD-RW): reads DVDs at up to 8x speed, writes CD-R discs at up to 24x speed, writes CD-RW discs at up to 16x speed, reads CDs at up to 24x speed)Since Apple tends to give only a few options, and I can't find a single example anywhere of a 6x version, I assume that Amazon is wrong on the title.  In all fairness, since I did not check the speed of the DVD, a real world measurement might make that close to a 6x, but that is not the common way to rate the drive speed and I doubt Amazon did such a test and decided to publish only the precise values for the DVD.So far, for the few days I have it, the computer is great.

Amazon delivered a zero-defect machine to me within the promised 2-day shipping deadline for a very reasonable price, which is par for the course with Amazon in my experience.  The rebate program makes this about the lowest cost for these machines on the web  (you can currently get a $75 mail-in rebate from MacMall on this machine plus some 'extras', but for me the ease of the on-line Amazon rebate and the decent customer service they provide in case of a problem outweighed the few extra incentives from the MacMall folks).The machine itself comes with all you need to get going, but a ram upgrade will definitely boost the performance, particularly if you are running Parallels or VMWare to use Windows in a virtual machine configuration.  For those of you who may be considering a purchase directly from Apple in order to customize your system configuration, take a careful look at the cost of purchasing extra RAM or HD upgrades from a third party and installing the hardware youself.  You'll most likely receive your machine faster, both RAM and HD upgrades on this machine are 5-10 minute jobs, and the cost-savings over a custom configuration from Apple is substantial.  The only caveat being that any damage you cause to your system performing RAM or HD upgrades is not covered by the Apple warranty.Choosing the base model (2.0 Ghz. Combo Drive) vs. this model (2.16 Ghz. Superdrive) was for me the most difficult decision to make.  The extra Mhz. that the 2.16 Ghz. processor delivers is essentially unnoticeable in real-world performance.  So the primary consideration seems to be, is the DVD burning capability worth the extra $200?  The Combo drive can be upgraded by some 3rd party companies, but unlike the RAM or HD is NOT an easy job.  For me the extra cost was worth it for the occasional need to burn large files to DVD when away from my primary machine, YMMV.As with all laptops, these machines are more prone to failure than the desktop hardware, and will be more costly to fix should they break, so I would highly recommend purchasing Applecare for this product for the additional 2 years of hardware warranty it provides.", "Date": "June 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "LOVE IT!", "Author": "B.

I just plug the camera into the laptop via a USB connector and the software does the rest.  I had pretty much given up on digital photography, but now find that I am using the camera a lot and easily sharing pictures with friends over the Web.The only drawback to this laptop is that it gets quite hot when it's in use for awhile.  (I've noticed that happens with my MacBook Pro too, as well as with other laptops I've had. But the Pro doesn't present a problem because I don't use it on my lap because it's a bit too large for comfort).

My frustration with Windows' reliability and the testimonials of a couple of friends who recently converted to macs inspired me to spring for one, and life has been much better since!  I love the mag power cord, the compact size of it (although I was worried about the small screen size -- which has proved only difficult when reading and typing in word, so I just use the zoom feature and set it at 150%), and the great programs including dashboard and ilife suite.  I installed office for mac and have found it to be a great improvement over office for windows.One day I got real confused over how to uninstall a program I had installed and changed my mind about.  I kept trying to look for a \"add/remove programs\" in the system preferences menu, but couldn't find one.  Finally, after asking my roommate, I learned that all you have to do is drag the program icon from the finder onto the trash icon!  It took care of everything automatically.  I didn't believe the fix would be that quick, so I found a forum online, and indeed, it was that easy.  Microsoft had trained me that these matters are complex.  Apple simplifies them.My other worry was that I wouldn't like the keyboard, but I think I like it either just the same or better than those with beveled-edge keys.  The programs work pretty well with each other, the mail program and address book feature is fantastic (especially for downloading v-cards), and the photo booth program is incredibly fun and addictive.  My only complaint (that I share with a couple of my friends) is that the iphoto program is confusing and cumbersome for organizing your photos.  I miss just creating folders for events in Windows, and haven't yet taken a lot of time to figure out the best way of grouping my pictures so that they're consistent in the finder (the windows \"my computer\" counterpart) and in iphoto.

What I found out was that the Macbook actually saved me $200 or so when compared to other laptops that feature the Core 2 Duo processor.  I could have spent $500 on a Windows laptop but the features would not come close to the Macbook.  The Core 2 Duo processor is amazing; the Macbook boots very fast and so do the applications.  The built in webcam is fun to mess around with and I like the power of the built in wireless network as well.  Also, most Windows laptops do not offer a DVI port but the Macbook allows you to use  DVI with an option $20 adaptor - this was another thing that sealed the deal for me.  I have an HD LCD TV and a Samsung DVI LCD and I would like to use either one of them with my laptop.  The screen is glossy and crystal clear.  The laptop is light - only weighs six pounds.

I have not always had them, for example because I use computers issued by my workplace, but when possible Mac's what I've had off and on over the years.  About a year ago I bought a Macbook and Applecare protection plan as a gift for my college-bound son.  The computer has not been troublesome until recently, although I found myself wondering why a $1300 (plus plus plus) Macbook was any better than the $500 Dell I use at work. Experience over the last month has soured me on ever buying another Apple product ever.  The problem is in customer support.  The Macbook broke down (or was inadvertly damaged), which I thought would be a simple matter to diagnose, relate to the warranty, and correct...even if not covered by the warranty.  The first trip by my college age son to the Apple store produced advice from the Apple technician to send it somewhere else due to expected delays and difficulties---better to pay someone else to fix it than to deal with Apple...despite having the expensive Applecare extended service plan. This without any real diagnosis of the problem.  So we took it to Comp USA, listed on the Apple website as an authorized Apple repair center. To make a long story short, Comp USA completely fumbled after charging me $100 for data recovery, which it turned out can not be done with voiding the Applecare warranty. (The authorized technicians at Comp USA were unaware of this.) They never did the data recovery, and I had to return to the store and wait in a long line to get a refund.  It turned out that there is virtualy no provision for data recovery when Macs go down (perhaps it can be done by paying a minimum of $500 to an outside service). Okay, backing up is the customer responsibility.  After the computer sat in the authorized service center unrepaired and un-sent to Apple for over a week, with the technician there lying that it had been \"sent to Apple,\" I finally went to that store to pick it up.  I took the computer again to the Apple store to drop it off to be sent for repair, only to find out that to drop off a malfunctioning computer requires an appointment---and they specify the time.  So now yet another trip to the Apple store. Too bad if you're supposed to be at work during all these trips.  Counting that,  a routine malfunction, still unresolved has caused me (or my son) five trips through heavy traffic to absolutely nowhere.  In the meantime, my son who needs the computer for college work, has been computerless for almost a month and counting. Everything about this experience has been stupid, rude, wasteful, and frustrating. This from a company that charges a premium price for its products and absolutely needs customer loyalty.  Whether the computer merely malfunctioned or has suffered trauma, I do not know.  I can live with either conclusion.  The point is with Apple it has been impossible to even get ANYWHERE on this problem despite extensive efforts.

I expect my Mac to be reliable, and I must admit it has only crashed once in two months. Eventually, when I have learned OS X, I may love my Mac. The display is beautiful.

Boy was I wrong. The problems I've had getting online with the laptop are enough to make anyone scream. Macbooks basically don't work well at all with routers. If you are hardwiring (ethernet cable) to your broadband modem or whatever then you're probably fine. Dont' take my word for it though. Go check the discussion board on Apple's website under macbook and internet connectivity. You'll find thousands of other disgrunted buyers who have had major problems connecting to wireless routers.  In addition, my macbook has 2GB of RAM. I had an extra gig added at my own expense. I thought this would make my mac much faster than my Dell Inspiron which has 1.24 GB of RAM. Again, I was mistaken. My Dell is still somehow faster and it's running on Windows XP with a 1.7 Ghz processor.  Also, if you need to use other software products like Excel, Windows Media (to download and play videos), or Shockwave from Macromedia...good luck to you. I have had nothing but problems getting these programs to work at all and when I've been able to get add on software to work well it still doesn't have the ease of functionality as my Dell.  To be honest I'm very surprised to find all these problems with my Macbook. I assumed that all I had heard about Macs was true and that's why I made the switch.

All in all after using it for a couple days i really missed computers and decided to return it, i am now shoppng for a new pc laptop. Alot of the stuff apple gives you is based around photo's music and movies , which is kinda nice in  way but i still feel that apple is a niche product and that there is a reason why 90% of people still use windows based pc's. windows may not be perfect but it is a universally usable product that is the best way to use the internet among other things. And apples are'nt exactly cheap either. And there is still alot of stuff like peripherals and programs that don't work for apple os , even though apple is growing alot of stuff is still left out for apple users.

Attempts to rig iCalendar and iAddress bookl to syncwith the Palm Pilot did not go well.Word, Excel, Acrobat Professional and Endnote were far slower on a brand new MacBook than they were on a PC purchased two years ago for much cheaper. This probably reflects the general trend for companies to put far less effort into Mac programs than PC ones (supply and demand).OSX has great looks and graphics capabilites, but I was unimpressedwith the basic functionality. For example:anchored highlighting is ludicrousswitching between tasks is much less efficient than on a PC, wherealt-tab really does the job (I tried a freeware utility called\"Witch\", but it functioned very slowly)I suppose I could have invested more time and money in trying more Macnative software (DevonThink, Scribner, Bookends, Pages, etc), butsince I need to be interoperable with the rest of the world--and likegetting things like the new version of google, I found it moreefficient to cut my losses and switch back.I do miss the streamlined design of the MacBook, and its greattrackpad, with the two-fingered double click and scrolling.

After troubleshooting with the phone agents (for which, by the way, I had to pay a ridiculous $50 because my 3-month-included phone plan ran out...by mere days), I was able to fix the shutdown problem, but now the computer will not run without the power chord. It does not turn on without the power chord. At all.I am deeply shocked and disturbed that a product like this would break down so quickly. I have never experienced anything like this before, with any kind of electronic.

If you are determined to buy an apple product, stick to desktops. You might find that you get lots of unnecessary headaches with your macbook. Don't be fooled by its cute look and speed.
