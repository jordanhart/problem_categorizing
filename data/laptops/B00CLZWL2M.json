It arrived and I immediately used it using my Wifi. The connection would connect then cut off, then connect, then cut off, every minute or so. I called Acer. They told me to do a few things including downloading and reinstalling the wifi driver. That didn't fix it. I told the guy that I already did that before I called them. I asked them if they would just send me a new wifi card (internal) that is very easy to replace, but they declined stating that I have to send the computer back for a replacement computer. Before doing so, I decided to do a search on the internet for a fix. I found it.  Instead of just re-installing the driver which is what they said to do, I deleted the existing driver and then reinstalled it again. That did the trick. It works perfectly now. If you have this problem, go to their website and download the driver. it is WirelessLAN_Broadcom_5.100.82.112_W7x86W7x64_ABefore you install it, go to your device manager and UNINSTALL the existing driver. THEN install this one. It now works perfectly. If you just reinstall the new driver over the old one, it will not fix the problem, so don't neglect deleting the OLD driver before installing the new one.Now for the second problem. I know this computer didn't come with great sound capabilities but still, the volume, when set to 100% was VERY low. I made a few adjustments and now the sound is about 50% louder.The solution:- Have song playing so you can here the difference.- Right click on the speaker icon in the task bar and select Playback Devices (or find it in the Windows Control Panel) The Sound dialog box opens up.- From the Playback tab select the Playback device being used, in my case Speakers Realtek High Definition Audio (marked with a green checkbox) and click the Properties button. A new dialog box - Speaker Properties - opens up.- On the Enhancements tab make sure \"Disable All Sound Effects\" and \"Immediate Mode\" are both UNchecked. Check Loudness Equalization (on my setup all other unchecked) and hit Apply.- Bingo! Sound volume is up a lot, maybe 50%!For the price, this is an excellent computer. I gave it three stars because Acer should have been able to tell me how to correct the WIFI problem and the sound should not have been set to a LOW maximum volume.Not all models have these problems, as they use different parts from different vendors when building these, as all computer companies do, but if you have either or both of these issues, the two fixes I gave will fix your problem.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "simple to use, good quality for the money !", "Author": "David W.

I have another Acer laptop that I use occasionally, and compared the cd/dvd players.  I fiddled with something that looked a little out of place, and the player worked.

I wanted something with enough power to run some data analysis programs and have several programs of web windows open at one time without slowing down.  I also wanted a PC that was portable but still full sized since it would be my everyday work computer and with a CD/DVD drive.  I've owned 2 PC's and 1 Mac in the past, all laptops.  After several days of looking through specs and reading reviews I settled on the Acer Aspire E1-531-4665.  Unfortunately, I have constantly regretted that decision.Upon unboxing the Acer I immediately noticed the extremely cheap build quality.  It is made of very flimsy plastic and even lifting the screen by one of the corners feels as if I am bending the entire thing.  I have learned to open it with two hands, one placed on the center of the bottom and the other on the exact center of the top part with the screen.  The hole for the webcam is oval in shape while the camera itself is round.  Therefore the camera is jammed into one corner of the oval hole with a gap at the other corner.  The camera is also not flush and tilted so that one side of the small, round camera is sticking out more than the surrounding plastic which the other side is recessed.  The keyboard works fine but it probably the worst keyboard I've used with rough, klinky keys.  I was expecting a lot more for four hundred dollars but overall I would still have given the Acer 3.5 or 4 stars if it performed well despite the cheap build, it did not.I started the computer up for the first time and navigated through all the bloatware asking me to sign up for this and register for that and start this free trial.  I was not very impressed with the screen resolution.  I had read some reviews and marketing jargon talking about the \"wide screen ultra resolution screen\" or something like that but I probably should have checked the specs a little closer to see that the max resolution is 1366 x 768 pixels.  After playing around to see what was where and getting comfortable with the new computer I downloaded several programs I needed for different grad courses.  I added a few personal photos to use as desktop backgrounds but otherwise did not add any other photos, videos, movies, or music and specifically avoided downloading any larger programs like iTunes just to be on the safe side and keep this PC running smoothly.Well after just a few days I noticed that things were slowing down.  Even with just a web browser open the computer would have to stop and wait to catch up.  Then one day after having the computer for a week or two it wouldn't turn on until after a few tries.  I guess I should have known then that this was not the computer I was looking for and tried to return it but I generously gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued using it.I'm now over two months into using this computer strictly for work (I have a different computer at home that I use for personal stuff).  The Acer continues to run slow, taking a while to turn on and having trouble running 2 or 3 simple programs at once.  Now after some automatic updates it ran last week I can't even log onto the computer.  At the sign in page I enter my password and hit \"enter\" and it tells me that the \"profile services system is not functioning\" or something like that and takes me right back to the sign in page.  I was able to find a workaround but it seems to only be temporary.  I understand that this recent issue is probably due to the operating system and not the PC itself but since I bought it with Windows 7 preloaded it's still part of the product.The login issue was the straw that broke the camels back for me and I am not trying to contact Acer Support for some help or a refund.  I'm not very hopeful since the limited warranty only provides software \"support\".  Great, I'll get to spend hours on the phone with someone I can barley understand just to have them try to talk me through fixing my PC but I doubt it will solve the underlying issues of the computer running very slowly and having trouble turning on sometimes.  I really need a work computer and if things are not resolved soon I think I will have to just bite the bullet and buy another PC (not easy on a graduate student budget).I did register my computer with Acer but there's no option after that to click on the specific computer to ask for support.  Instead I clicked the link that said \"Need Help\" but that took me to a page that couldn't load or didn't exist.  I'm getting a really bad feeling about all of this but I will try to work through the problems and update this review with any news.For now, I'm resigned to not buying anything else from Acer after this experience.  I could have spent less on a laptop but I paid four hundred dollars expecting a machine that could at least run the programs I use (I'm not talking about playing 3D online games or editing HD video) and have a decent standard of build quality.  The Acer Aspire E1-531-4665 has failed on all accounts.Edit March 3, 2014This computer continues to disappoint! It's still running slow and often having issues opening/closing programs.  I've talked with several IT professionals and tried different antivirus and malware protection.  It caught some issues but now says the computer is protected so I feel like these issues have to be inherent in the hardware and software of this machine.  Today it started running VERY slow.  I had 4 or 5 programs open and it took me more than 5 minutes just to close them all (waiting for the computer to close them after clicking the \"x\" in one window at a time).  I then went to shutdown the computer and that took several minutes.  When I tried to start it up again it would only boot up in safe mode and started going through a recovery process.  That failed so it shut down again.  I finally got it started up again but it continues to be slow.  Maybe I just got a lemon but this thing sucks.  I'm a poor grad student and I am seriously considering dropping $500 to get a decent computer so I don't have to worry about this machine not functioning properly and leaving me without a work computer.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "ed122", "ReviewID": "R3CGGL6954YWZU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Arrived in good time well packaged.

This runs cooler then my mini & takes up way less space then my desktop did. With all my old records, pics & vids installed it barely makes a dent it the storage capacity.

The keys clack horribly when I type. The keyboard is oversized, so the letter keys are too big. I hate the feel of the keys, and it's off centered. The mouse pad is not centered, so the keyboard is also off center, which means you either type at a strange angle, or else have to move the computer to the right of your lap in order to have your hands centered to type properly. It gets really hot really quick, and the power cord also gets VERY hot quickly, dangerously so it seems. I've only had it a couple of days and already it's frozen and had to be forced to power off by holding the power key down. Twice so far it has just said \"logging off\" or \"shutting down\" but hasn't actually done it...not impressed at all.UPDATE 8/14/13:The sound on this machine is TERRIBLE! At full volume, you can hardly hear it and have to have almost total silence to make out the sound at all. I have never used a computer that has such awful sound ability. I followed another reviewer's advise posted for the same problem, and it did help some, but it's still not great. This machine is totally NOT worth the money.
