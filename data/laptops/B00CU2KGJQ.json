Good things:  it is really thin and light to hold in my lap (and doesn't get hot in my lap like my old computer); it starts up REALLY fast; and it is REALLY quiet (never hear a fan or disk drive).  Overall, I'm really happy with it.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Windows 7 laptops continue to be in demand", "Author": "Christopher \"Chris\"", "ReviewID": "RBZB7M1TC5QD8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As the in stock options for laptops shipping with Windows 7 continue to dwindle, this laptop shines among the best. I know Acer is a fairly new brand, but the components in it are top notch for the price. If you need a reliable laptop for work or home purposes, this laptop is absolutely for you. Enjoy!", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not so hot", "Author": "Mr Peter", "ReviewID": "RP99NLT0BQZM4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "All the outputs are on the back.  Awkward.  When you tip it forward to plug something in, the damn power button on the FRONT turns the laptop off.  Brilliant.  And, good luck finding the power button.  The DVD is also hard to find.Other than that, it works fine.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "great laptop", "Author": "john core", "ReviewID": "R7Z1P09YGLUSR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I order this and was impressed by the speed.

Contos", "ReviewID": "RN5I6CIAK4A8G", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Windows 7 and long battery life were important to me. I think the laptop looks nice too, despite the all plastic construction. The body's combination of dark matt and gloss will likely collect finger prints over time, though it does sleek. However, a faulty touchpad was a deal-breaker for me; I do a lot of typing on the road and using a mouse isn't always feasible. Further, I feel I shouldn't have to purchase a mouse in order to easily type.Out of the box, the touchpad was not accurate at all - it jumped and wouldn't settle. It moved even when my finger was still. Fresh drivers were installed (several times), then swapped for a different brand, per customer service and message boards. Hours later, this helped with some of the issues, but then the advanced options were no longer accessible. Further, the cursor jerked around whenever the laptop was plugged into an outlet. Was never able to remedy this fully. Don't take my word on this - search other Acer reviews and web boards before buying. I wish I had. If you never use the touchpad, it won't matter as much to you.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i3-2367M 1.40 GHz\n6 GB DDR3\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive, 20 GB Solid-State Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "Acer Aspire NX.RY8AA.005;M3-581T-6618 15.6-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Qkm711uvL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CU2KGJQ"}}
