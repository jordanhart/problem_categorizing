Still running fine.  I do have to do normal \"PC maintenance\" on the laptop, but it's great for surfing the web, running office, email, pictures, etc.  This is not a gaming PC by any means, but for typical use, it's just fine.  Like any laptop, battery does not typically last too long.  Overall, 5 stars for the price.", "Date": "February 15, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "15.4\" Widescreen\nPentium dual-core T2330\n80 GB Hard Drive", "Name": "Compaq Presario C700T Notebook", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31X46fvYIBL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0018S4VVW"}}
