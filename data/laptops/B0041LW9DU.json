Rice", "ReviewID": "R3C5L5313FM7X2", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the most part, I am satisfied with the laptop.  Had to get used to the keyboard, which is different than most other laptops I've used (has the number pad on the right, like a regular PC keyboard).  The touch pad is annoying in that the way it is placed, I end up bumping it unintentionally all the time, but that's minor.The main grievance I have with this laptop is the terrible quality of the speakers.  I need headphones to actually be able to HEAR - with headphones it is acceptable. Without headphones, the volume is very very muted.", "Date": "February 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "tricked", "Author": "candytt", "ReviewID": "R1YOH5PU3J1LGT", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The pictures used for this laptop are soooo misleading.

Performance is not.", "Author": "Free Advice", "ReviewID": "R1NALIF7PZZ8AD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop during a Black Friday sale last year.  I've been disappointed to say the least.  It is so sluggish on even mundane tasks. For example, the scroll bar on internet browsers, word processors, spreadsheets, etc. lags constantly, so you sit there looking at a frozen screen, until it decides to let you scroll on down the page (It's doing it as I work on this review). Sometimes, you can be typing away, and nothing goes into the text box, or you'll see a few characters, and then it skips the next few, like you never even pressed the keys for the letters in between. Also streaming videos, even after they have buffered, freeze up and jitter, and the audio sometimes has a delayed echo that's the same volume as the original audio.  Think of singing \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" with two people starting at different times. It's very annoying. Even .AVI movies and Windows Media files freeze up and skip. I thought it might just need a little more memory, so I added 2 more gigabytes of RAM, but didn't see any performance increase at all. And lastly, the speakers are so quiet, they are pretty much useless.  You have to use headphones to hear pretty much anything from the computer if there is any background at all.  If I had it to do all over again, I'd have spent just a little more and got a laptop that doesn't make me want to take a sledge hammer to it.", "Date": "July 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "as advertised", "Author": "steve", "ReviewID": "R1EMA6PP2NK3G0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this computer for my wife, so she could do her thing (e-mail, facebook, and such) and have her own computer.

It's good. Sometimes can be a bit slow. As in a general computer, it's good, but should not cost so much. As far as 'special', it is not. As far as worth $400, no way. I was blown away to see the price tag on this thing! I would not hae spent so much on it! To tell the truth, if you want a great computer-it's good, but even if you are spending a little bit more, I'd make sure you are getting some extra features for this kind of money.I am happy with it, in general. But if I were going to spend the money, I'd want something more than general. At least for that kind of money, offer a variety of colors-something!What has happened to quality customer service?", "Date": "December 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Warning!
