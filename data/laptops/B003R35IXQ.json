Otherwise; Great buy!", "Author": "Dakota", "ReviewID": "R17U0E59PGRJMV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First of all, I would like to say that I have owned four different laptops now, and, out of all of them I like this one second best. Strongly missing my Dell Studio 15, right now.This was a laptop purchased for me by a dear friend, since my Dell just kicked the bucket. We had decided on a cheaper Gateway laptop, but at the last minute she got me this one instead, thinking it was a nicer model.I can say that it is a physically attractive laptop... you can't tell from the photos, but, it has a nice sheen and some glitter in it if you're into that sort of thing.My number one complaint, and it's a pretty big deal to me, is that they tried to cram a full-sized keyboard onto a laptop, and the result is disastrous. When I got my Dell Studio, it was like putting on a glove in regards to comfort... but this Vaio is like putting a right shoe that is three sizes too small onto a left foot. My fingers and knuckles are already very sore due to the angle I have to type at to even try to put my fingertips on the correct keys. The touch pad is entirely unusable due to location and the texture they used for it.Other than that, the graphics card seems pretty nice, Guild Wars looks beautiful on this laptop and runs wonderfully-- just hope it'll handle Guild Wars 2. It seems to run things relatively fast, and came with Google Chrome already installed-- I was happy about that tidbit. Windows 7 is a great Operating System.For the price paid, it's a good buy, but will take getting used to for this ridiculous keyboard.", "Date": "December 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome!", "Author": "Tristi", "ReviewID": "R3LZIQAGCWXGS8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from a different retailer several months ago. I am extremely happy with my purchase! The only thing that that could be improved on is the sound which could be a little louder. I LOVE that this has the HDMI port (this was actually the main reason I chose this!) By connecting an HMDI cable from my laptop to TV, I am able to surf the web on a 50 inch screen (as well as watch movies, etc). I noticed that someone commented on the keyboard - personally, I have had no problems. My mom has Rheumatoid arthritis and uses my laptop frequently with no complaints. I think the keyboard is really cool! Plus if you shop around you can get a keyboard skin for under five bucks (The EB series fit perfectly!) I use this laptop for everything - school (Microsoft office), graphic design(Photoshop), and download many things to the hard drive. It has continued to run flawlessly! Also, there is an \"assist\" button that connects you with live help from Sony 24/7 (It's free, I use it all the time!) I highly recommend this laptop!!", "Date": "December 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony VAIO", "Author": "Barney", "ReviewID": "R3DWRNBS6K1G3T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift from me to a person out of state.
