An optical drive (I use my laptop to watch DVDs and I also still enjoy burning CDs), a touchscreen, a sleek design, a 14-inch screen, and a reasonable price. It's darn near impossible to find 14-inch laptops with optical drives these days for prices that aren't premium. When I found this device, I felt I'd hit the jackpot.It works like a dream, looks beautiful, and has everything I needed. I have had none of the wifi issues others have mentioned.It has taken me a while to get used to the spacing on the keyboard, but I LOVE the back-lighting, which I expected to find annoying. Also, I chose the 14-inch because I have no need for a number pad and this doesn't have one.The touch-pad can take some getting used to. My previous laptop was similar though, as it only had a smooth surface rather than separate buttons for right and left clicking so it's been easy for me. I like the texture of the touch-pad because it's not shiny or slick.I do have a 6gb memory as opposed to the 4gb. The deal I found was actually for the 6gb so I didn't have to deal with any upgrading, but 6gb is good enough for me. I cant speak for how well the 4gb runs, but I would think it would be best to upgrade if you're a heavy computer user.I will recommend this laptop to anyone and everyone. If you can find it at a better price, don't worry about it seeming cheap. I was worried because of what a great deal I got that it might be cheapy and it is literally the best laptop I've used.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Damaged", "Author": "Tran Nguyen", "ReviewID": "R2N65G8ZON2VRH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My boyfriend opened it on Christmas day and the screen was completed pitch black.  Tried a few times but did not work.  Very disappointing since it was a Christmas gift for him.  The seller wanted me to test to make sure that it doesn't work or else they would charge 20-50% fees for restocking once I send it back but I'm not a expert, I turn it on and off a few times and it still wouldn't work so there's nothing else I could've done.  They also suggested to contact the manufacturer because it's still under warranty, I wouldn't want to purchase a brand new laptop then have to go get it fixed.  Overall, I'm very upset and disappointed.  Hopefully, they can resolve the whole issue and refund me in full including the shipping cost for returning that I would have to pay for.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "sharp looking laptop", "Author": "Tana Dorsey", "ReviewID": "R3OUL9N4ZNQHZ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is great! It is so slim and easy to carry around, yet it has a CD ROM which is what I was specifically looking for. Nowadays if the laptop is super slim then they just eliminate the CD ROM. I do have two critiques, the touch screen works great for the most part, but can be hard to touch the small X to close a tab or other small items on the screen so I revert to the touchpad. The second is that I do tend to use the touchpad more (just more familiar with it) but sometimes it makes the cursor jump to different locations on the screen. I'm not sure if it is because the touchpad is super sensitive and detects another finger (even if it is not touching the pad) or if it is a flaw. I just deal with it though. Other than that I love the way it looks and it functions well. One more thought. I didn't realize that many computers that you buy these days do not include the full Microsoft Suite. We were lucky to have a friend who could hook us up with it, but that is an expense to consider when you are shopping around.", "Date": "December 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value.", "Author": "Barbara L McMahan", "ReviewID": "RHVMBVXFE0CIT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read the reviews before purchasing this computer.

My last computer was still running Window's XP (yes, that Acer was a dinosaur) and it is taking quite a bit of getting use to Window's 8.  One other thing that I wish it had was a Blu Ray player but that isn't that big of a deal.  I do love the graphics card in this machine that allows me to work in one program on the built-in monitor, and have an outside feed to my TV through the HDMI port (dual \"screen\").  It is also very quick to start up and an overall great computer so far!", "Date": "April 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "bummer", "Author": "E.
