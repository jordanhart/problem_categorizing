It is packed full of features you would expect from a more expensive laptop ( when purchased for $599.00 from BestBuy ). I put in many hours of research before buying this model. Just Google it and you will see all the great things people have said.But I must say...Amazon usually has great prices. Lord knows I have purchased just about everything from here. In this instance the above seller, not Amazon, is making an absolute killing. Buyer be warned!", "Date": "January 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "great laptop for great price", "Author": "M. Wolfer", "ReviewID": "R3VWF9T8TZ0VG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop this past weekend and it is great. My old Dell is a little faster for surfing on the internet but this is only a bit slower.  Has great memory storage and the battery charge lasts quite awhile. The built in webcam is great, I like the skype to talk and now see my family. The speakers are great, plays the music pretty loud for its size. The keys are a nice size and the screen is perfect, really nice picture and nice and bright, keeps the keys well lit for typing in the dark. However, I didnt buy this from Amazon, I got it at Best Buy this past weekend for $449.00 vs. Amazon's high price. Overall, great laptop for the price!", "Date": "February 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good, sturdy computer for the casual or business user.", "Author": "Sara Bear", "ReviewID": "R2EA2TMY6XGK3Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "To start, this is not a gaming laptop. Don't buy this if you are a hardcore gamer and need the latest computer games to run perfectly. You will be disappointed. But for the casual user, a student, or someone who uses their computer for business, this Toshiba Satellite is a great investment. The speed is great, there's plenty of storage space, and the battery life is amazing as far as laptops go. Fully charged, the battery will last for 5-7 hours, depending on what you are doing. The large battery is a little awkward if you have the computer sitting on your lap, but it's great for on top of a desk or table. The battery props up the computer up so you can type in a more comfortable position.I've had this laptop for over two years and I only have a couple of negative things to say about it. The speakers aren't the greatest. They work fine, but they don't get very loud which can be a buzzkill if you're playing some music for friends. I also was not happy with the amount of Toshiba \"crapware\" that came pre-installed on the machine. I eventually upgraded my harddrive and was happy to have all that useless software eradicated. Overall, this computer has been well-worth the money I paid for it.", "Date": "March 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic....At First", "Author": "kati cayer", "ReviewID": "R2VF2QS82O4VX3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "At first, this laptop was wonderful. It ran fast (still does) and has a nice screen size. However, The touch pad is extremely sensitive and the surrounding area as well. I always have trouble scrolling. I also have had problems with Toshiba's battery port for the computer end. I've had two Toshiba Computers and both ports have brpken within a 6th month period. I haven't dropped either of them, shaken them or mishandled the computers in any way. I also got an extended battery for my laptop and that runs down in a short amount of time. If Toshiba got their act together hardware wise, I would've rated my old computer and this on a little higher.", "Date": "May 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review is for the computer only, not the vendor", "Author": "Repentant Centurion", "ReviewID": "R173T9SIAVXSH6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this laptop, have had mine since Nov 09.  Only problem so far is with Windows 7 compatibility with Word 07 which is a software issue not related to this specific laptop.  Worked fine for two months, now get a command error when I first open a Word document.  Have to click on it second time to get it opened.Very satisfied with laptop capabilities so far.  I don't do gaming, but have processed Video with Corel on it and had no problems.  Every once in a while I get a weird noise out of iTunes (both on speaker and headset) so not sure if thats the sound card or not.  Battery life is pretty amazing too.I do turn off the touch pad and use a mouse though.  The touchpad is super sensitive and found myself accidentally sending the cursor all over the place while typing.  Love the large keys, very user friendly with fat fingers!The laptop is fairly heavy though so if you need something lightweight this may not be the computer for you.I have no reservations recommending this computer, but get it somwhere else, this site is too expensive!", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Over Priced", "Author": "Mcgonigle \"Mikey Laptop\"", "ReviewID": "R16VVIGRST9W42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Best Buy has this Lap Top for 599.99, Amazon is suppose to have such GREAT prices....", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Lost faith in Toshiba", "Author": "Shawn", "ReviewID": "RHRZXGSXILI48", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is my 3rd Toshiba and I am sick of it. When I have a problem with one of Toshiba's product I expect that I will be taken care of because I am a consumer and paid a pretty penny. This laptop is the second with the first having a hardware issue. We took it right back to Best Buy and ended up buying the same model. We have had problems with the mouse pad (currently using USB mouse, Speakers (can only use headphones), and lots of problems with motherboard. Having to replace it here once. Sent to Toshiba to get it fixed and they send it back TOTALLY scratched up. Ended up having to take it to BestBuy and paying over 100 because when I received it back I needed new mother board plus a new Operating System. The purpose of a Laptop is not having to drag other things with you and I always have to have mouse, headphones, and powercord. The Battery does not last as long as they say it will not even half as much. I will never buy another single product from Toshiba again.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Bad on hard drives.", "Author": "P.
