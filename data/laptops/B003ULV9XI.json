So far, I have been disappointed in the speed of this machine.  I find that it freezes when I just have one Excel spreadsheet open.  This happened to me on multiple occassions since I received the laptop, but not all the time.  It seems that it freezes randomly.I would normally suspect something new with the machine that is causing the problem, since I upgraded from a lesser machine recently.  For example, maybe it's Windows 7 Professsional or Office 2007.  This is not the case since I had the exact same operating system and applications on my previous laptop.On a positive note, I really like the integrated mouse features, as you can customize them however you like.  Some of the great features are: ability to zoom using gestures similar to Apple's iPhone, fast scrolling, button customization, and more.", "Date": "September 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Top of the line!!", "Author": "juan", "ReviewID": "R1XBQEVME5G4J9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have the 8gb ram and 320 gb hard drive and for me i think this computer is pretty fast and the price you can't beat that .", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not what I was looking for", "Author": "ronald patton", "ReviewID": "R3H5JXZS8EPTP1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "it was a bust for me, I'm sure it would work for someone else but it wasn't for me !!!!!", "Date": "January 17, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,403.11", "Features": "Sold Individually", "Name": "Dell Latitude E5410 Notebook - Core i5 i5-520M 2.40 GHz - 14.1\" - Silver 4 GB DDR3 SDRAM - 320 GB HDD - DVD-Writer - Gigabit Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth - Windows 7 Professional", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31PapqwLKjL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B003ULV9XI"}}
