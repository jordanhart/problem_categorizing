However, when I got the laptop the screen is matte (or Acer ComfyView). I have no problem with that since I wanted a matte screen, but just something to be aware of.Still haven't tried the BlurayDisc Drive or any video games to see that GTX 760M in action. I will update the review when I try some games. (The ones I have - Fallout: New Vegas, Bioshock, Bioshock 2).Also, I never tried the speaker since I use the ATH-M50 headphones whatever I do.PROS:- As expected, Intel delivered with their i7 processor. That thing is fast!- SSD and HDD combo is unbeatable! It boots in less than 10 seconds.- The Full HD screen looks amazing (especially when you update to Windows 8.1 which solves pixelated icons).- Windows 8 is not bad at all, as I expected it would be. If you stay away from that new interface you basically have a Win 7. And it also has a few new little things I really liked.- I don't even know what to say about USB 3.0, it's that fast! I used the SanDisk Extreme 32gb flash drive and transffered 7gb of music in 1 minute and 35 seconds!CONS: There's only one con I have so far, and it's so small it's dumb to even write anything.- No light for Caps Lock! I have used it for only a couple of days and it happens way to often that I don't know if Caps is on or off.  Again, this is very minor. It should never affect the purchase of this PC.For this price, I don't think you will find anything better than this. Definetely recommended to everyone who likes casual gaming and (very) fast everyday tasks.", "Date": "December 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "ZERO STARS", "Author": "preecher \"a man\"", "ReviewID": "R3527JLFNLH73E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am a seasoned IT person.  I have several computers...mostly dell and hp which I have never had any serious issues with.  I bought this system in oct of 2013 as an  early Christmas gift to myself.  I had difficulty with it from the start.  especially when I moved from one location to another the wireless is just haywire...and yes I updated all drivers...then there's windows 8.1...what a crock.  anyway I tried to power this thing up today to continue a model in zbrush which I only kept in quicksave so now I've lost it,  and the stupid piece of crap will not even load windows.  I called because of course it's under warranty and I got a guy in india who didn't seem to know anything about the system and he said I had only ONE option to send it to TX for repair.  I asked him why it needed repairing what was wrong and got some bull.  so now I have a 1k piece of crap....what could I use it for?  a dinner tray...warning stay away from this.  do research and see all the other problems folks are having with acer and windows 8.1.  I hate windows 8.1 on this computer and the computer was ok until it quit working in a little over 6 months.  I do 3d modeling and photo editing on it.  not anymore time to pull dell out.  goodbye acer...wish I could say been nice knowing you but I cant...pitiful customer service and sorrow product....and to anyone looking for a nontablet with windows 8.1 I would not advise it...I much prefer windows 7.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E0OMWCQ"}}
