Yes, I needed to update the drivers....just as I do with virtually every computer or smart device I own. But bottom line, this has been solid in my home wireless network. The screen and the sound quality are impressive. No problem with the touchpad which I saw others complain about. Battery has been holding up well. No problem with any of my software or connecting to my wireless printer. The only real head scratcher was with the operating system. This device was preloaded with Win 7 as advertised, but all the included disks were for Win 8. I happen to have a Win 7 DvD so no issue for me, but thought Lenovo should have included one. The only other issue is lack of a detailed \"user guide\". Again, I don't really need one, but should be standard issue.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Computer with Reasonable Price", "Author": "Utsav", "ReviewID": "R2YDPSD7KAOMCB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "One thing is for sure. You get a decent computer for the price range. It's nice looking with a decent keyboard and it's very light. It comes with Windows 7 pro pre-loaded and Windows 8 CD's with it. I like Windows 7 so that works for me.Good battery, fn key and ctrl key is in swapped position in the keyboard so that takes a while to get use to. Also I would have like separate buttons for volume control and function keys. It's a great hardware but not the greatest software. Yes you have to update the drivers, which you should and you have to with any computer out there. But my problem was that if i run a few programs at once and i'm programmer so i do open a couple of IDE's and workbench, software starts acting up, maybe hang up for couple of seconds, which in windows 7 is rare.Overall it's solid and satisfying for the price I've paid.", "Date": "March 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Business class with a gamers processor", "Author": "Gordon Phillips", "ReviewID": "R347SVB0ZOOEHV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It's solid, sturdy and powerful. Keyboard is well put together, the chassis allows one to easily make repairs and upgrades. While the memory and hard drive could be better the threaded quad-core is the reason to buy this laptop. If you work with cpu intensive applications this will shame anything in the atom class, if that is a \"class\".If you want really great performance you'll need to upgrade the memory and replace the hard drive with an ssd. There are only three screws in the way of doing that, it does seem well-built, and the board takes upgrades well, with a little work you can get better than ultrabook for under a grand.However, and this is five stars of however (like other sites Amazon won't let me leave a zero), when you remove the battery to upgrade the memory or ssd Lenovo will begin spitting bios and Windows errors that it doesn't support non-Lenovo parts, and you're using a non-Lenovo battery. This is an issue for me as I usually leave my laptop on a kvm switch under the desk and I don't like having to go down there and deal with it every time windows feels the need to error reboot.It's the same battery you fools, I only pulled it to upgrade your known weaknesses. Lenovo must issue a bios update to settle this issue.Like most tech companies Lenovo doesn't know if they deal in hard or soft-- ware. They have great hardware here, but their software is far below zero.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Doesn't work", "Author": "CD", "ReviewID": "R97X2KXAUFCWE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Turned on great...but then I closed the top.  When I came back and opened up - the wireless LAN didn't work.So after a day of use, I'm spending all this time trying to hunt for a solution. Seems the drivers are not up to date. Not what I expect from a brand new product.Do yourself a favor. Buy something else.-------------------------------------An update...I called Lenovo support.  They updated the drivers with me. Surprisingly no help. Eventually they determined that loading and running Chrome or Skype (which I had done as I use them a lot) seemed to be at the root of the problem.  I removed Chrome and took Skype out of auto-start mode and the problem is gone. Decide for yourself if this is an issue...not so much for me. Changed my rating upward based on very strong phone support.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$799.00", "Features": "Processor: Intel Core i7-3632QM Quad Core Processor (6M Cache, 2.20GHz - 3.20GHz) 35W\nRAM: 4GB (1x4GB) DDR3 1600MHz\nHard Drive: 500GB 7200rpm Hard Disk Drive\nOptical Drive: SuperMulti 8X DVD+/-R/RW Dual Layer", "Name": "ThinkPad Edge 62775CU 14\" LED Notebook - Intel Core i7 i7-3632QM 2.20 GHz - Matte Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41J9OwKp%2BpL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D5TPT4A"}}
