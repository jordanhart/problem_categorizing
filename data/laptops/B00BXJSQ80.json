{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very impressed", "Author": "Nicholas Nall", "ReviewID": "R2D7IZZIYDZJNI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer refurbished from a computer repair company in california and I have to say, it was one of the best buys I've made. This computer normally sells for upwards of 1000.00 and I got it for just over 400. Start up is immediate, battery lasts forever. Keyboard and aesthetic features are pristine. It's like having a Mac without having to use or pay for a Mac. It's very solidly built, with a magnetic pull that lets you know when the computer is securely closed. Also, the air vent, located in the center rear of the computer, is completely silent when in use. It's a detail that may not seem like much but I've found  not having any noise really enhances the user experience. The touchpad is huge but has a very thin, sleek profile.Since mine came with only factory drivers (which can be kind of touchy and erratic), I upgraded to a more user-friendly driver I was told about through samsung's website.Great computer!", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit\nIntel Core I5 2450M\n14.0\" LED HD (300nit,non-gloss)\n8GB DDR3 1333MHz (4GB x 2)\n750GB (5400RPM, SATA)", "Name": "Samsung NP-QX411-A01UB 14\" Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/4137zTW57RL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BXJSQ80"}}
