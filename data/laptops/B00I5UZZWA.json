I have always preferred 14 inch laptops or smaller for portability, but I went with the 15.6 inch just to get Windows 7. I actually really like the larger screen and more capable processor, which is not available in smaller models. This model is very powerful for a laptop, good graphics, very well engineered interface between the integrated and discrete graphics.I recommend the computer, but not if you are planning to carry it with you everywhere you go because it is not light due to the good material. Battery life is acceptable.In my opinion, HP did a good job with this computer!", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Machine, Great supplier", "Author": "Carla Davidson", "ReviewID": "R281394RPG4LUP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first review EVER. I felt the need to say something about the supplier more than the computer but really, the computer is the  BOMB. I got windows 7 on mine with the intel core 17. I only just opened it a while ago but I did my research before making my decision. It doesn't come with much bloatware if any. Such a clean machine. My only regret is that I did not get the backlit keyboard which really depressed me but it was not the fault of the supplier, but rather mine. The laptop is a beauty. The audio is the best I have ever heard on a laptop. Well with Dr. Dre's beats audio, what do you expect. Trust me when I say IT IS THE BEST.The keyboard layout has a lovely red line around the keyboard that is set on the outer frame of the keyboard but lining the inner rim that looks really cool. It's like a hidden element of surprise because you only notice it when you hold the keyboard up. I guess it would have illuminated a bit had I have gotten the backlit keyboard.. Sigh Sigh.  With the beats logo in red on the aluminum looks absolutely gorgeous with a backlit keyboard. But again, unfortunately I did not get that keyboard. If you want it I think you will have to customize it. Don't get mixed up with the word backlight on the specs that is displayed on the amazon site. That refers to the screen and not the keyboard. Go to 'See more specs'  and verify the type of specs that is there. If you want to tweak anything don't hesitate to contact the seller.  In my case it was LGI Electronics.  Obviously your price will be affected.Concerning the supplier, I would recommend you to go with them. LGI Electronics provided great feedback and assurance. My item reached on time. I was able to track my shipment and when I had concerns which was because of my own anticipation and excitement, they responded in record time to my emails with all the info I needed. I choose them because they are Authorized HP Dealers, so I felt secure.Go get this laptop guys and make sure you have the keyboard backlit. It is worth it. The Laptop is Quality and Quality costs money but saves headache.I am trusting that this laptop will last me for the next three to five years.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "PERFECT!!!", "Author": "Troy Rust", "ReviewID": "R6IHB6WRTGZW4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Everything I was looking for.

Thin profile and lightweight. I tried out a graphics heavy game that used to be too much for my old desktop PC (Morrowind, a classic), and it runs like a champ. My one disappointment is that it doesn't have the backlit keyboard keys, but that's not a dealbreaker to me. Certainly not one that would make me exchange it. I'm very happy with this laptop, otherwise.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "One \"down side\"...", "Author": "Viola Merritt", "ReviewID": "RHBUMZQZR34BP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very disappointed to discover that this very nice laptop does not have an internal DVD / CD drive :(", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I5UZZWA"}}
