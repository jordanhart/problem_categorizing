I can't say enough good things about it. It's sleek, light, fast, with enough RAM to get the job done and I have always preferred an Intel processor to an AMD. The keyboard is a traditional keyboard with a number pad on the right. It comes with really cool face recognition software for logging in. It also comes with Microsoft Office Starter 2010 which is really great. It's not a trial program either. Except that it's missing the ability to track changes, etc. most of the common Word features are there. There was some bloatware but nothing you can't get rid of in fairly short order. I couldn't be happier and this was a good price! I got it cheaper at Lenovo Outlet than what they have here on Amazon and the Outlet comes with a 1 year depot warranty.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Gorgeous Piece of Affordable Tech", "Author": "Curt", "ReviewID": "RADNKSLZ8VRE9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this for college and love it! It runs almost silently and doesn't get overheated even with multiple programs/windows open (I may get a cooling thing if I decide to get more intensive games but barring that it does just fine by itself). For this price, probably one of the best deals you're gonna find. I spent months looking at different laptops and was pointed to Lenovo by a friend. I'm very glad that I listened to him.Sleek, impressive speakers, crisp images, quick, multi-tasks really well, and the keyboard is very comfortable (which is always something I worry about for some reason). Battery hasn't been a problem, but I have the cords in my backback with me just in case, mostly for when I have rehearsals without clear time requirements.Not the most comprehensive review anyone will have ever read but if nothing else, I would highly recommend this computer to anyone.Also, it isn't that big a deal but facial recognition log-in via the camera makes me feel like a secret agent. Huge plus for that one Lenovo!", "Date": "October 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "carlos conversi", "Author": "giovanni conversi", "ReviewID": "R2D5IQFZ1KKKUS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excelente producto , empacado de excelente manera , todo lo que publico del producto era cierto , recomendado 100% .", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Best i3", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"The Artist\"", "ReviewID": "R2BRB33T1KB7S5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one fast Lenovo i3. I can run Google Sketchup and  3 other Animation programs  without hesitation. Rendering the Animation is a minor hurdle that the Lenovo IdeaPad can leap easily. This i3  is a 2.53GHZ  with 700GB and just 4GB of Ram and it does the everything smoothly. It initially had Windows 8 but I requested Windows 7 Premium , I'm just not a fan of Win 8.

I bought mine almost two years ago and it's served me very well in that time. I've been able to run just about whatever I please as long as it's not a higher level game, though most games it can handle fine. The keyboard felt very nice and the touchpad worked very well. My only gripe about this computer is that despite the built-in mechanisms for maintaining the battery's life over time, and taking reasonably good care of the battery in other ways myself, it has still become dependent on its cable. This may be an isolated incident, as I've never seen or heard of a battery degrade to that extent over a 2 year period. Overall however it is a great device and I still recommend it today!", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lenovo Ideapad Z560", "Author": "ase", "ReviewID": "RIYOOTBIK8KIN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We have had this for about 2 months. It has performed well with reasonable speed and connects to the wireless with no issues. I was looking for a low cost solution for my wife and 2 kids to use. Amazing to think that it is a requirement for 3rd grade to have a flash drive .... I do not like to wait for machines to work and I wanted something with some speed that would not have to be replaced next year. This looks like it will do the job.", "Date": "September 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good at the time but highly outclassed now", "Author": "Bahrain", "ReviewID": "R3K2LBEUMX525", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for over 2 years and now that I've ordered a desktop, I figured now is the perfect time to review it. 2 years ago, this laptop would have had great reviews from me; it was fast, sleek, and top of the line. But now that I've had it for such a long time, I've become pretty dissatisfied for what it had become. The laptop came with a bunch of useless programs that most people will never use and only takes up time and memory. The integrated graphics card makes it impossible for higher level rendering or gaming. The internet reception is verrrry poor if you're using wifi. The laptop overheats like a dog in the summertime even without any dust in the system. The keyboard is great, but one of the keys came loose a few months after buying it. The quality is poor as well. One of my friends accidentally dropped my bag with this laptop in it from about three feet and the disk reader slot came apart. Soon after, the power plug part broke off and made it very difficult for the laptop to charge. The USB ports became loose in a short amount of time and the left hinge of the screen came apart for no apparent reason a few months later. It has served me well over the past few years but please do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere.", "Date": "June 2, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Lenovo Ideapad Z560 0914-42u Laptop", "Name": "Lenovo IdeaPad Z560 (0914-42U) Notebook, Intel Core i3 380M(2.53GHz), 15.6\" Wide XGA, 4GB Memory DDR3 1066, 320GB HDD 5400rpm, DVD\u00b1R/RW Intel HD Graphics", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21b%2B4TGSHtL.jpg", "ProductID": "B004OB0PJW"}}
