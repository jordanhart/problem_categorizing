Has more memory than I could ever need. Hasn't acted up or froze (which is a common Acer problem). Windows 8 is kind of goofy, really miss Vista, but theres a way to disable 8 and go back to Vista or 7.

I have to order a portable because at the highest volume you still barely can hear, and when I am watching movies or videos I want to hear, also I love to play Sims 3 and I have to be able to enjoy my game time.I would say this is a product I don't regret purchasing, my teenager is asking for it since day one.", "Date": "April 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "My gateway laptop review", "Author": "franciscohurtado", "ReviewID": "R21D7XVZMU80PK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "when I got this computer I was expecting all the exact details like on the amazon listing and it didn't exactly have the same specifics the listing said it had 320 GB but this one had 270GB so that ticked me off but the rest met the exact specifics its just im the type of person who wants to get their moneys worth and I don't think I really got it so becarefull and if u can contact the seller to see the exact specifics of the items f", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Looks great Works great", "Author": "Tommy A.

Bricker", "ReviewID": "R3QUTSWEZ6SZKC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We've had our Gateway NE56R31u for less than 2 years now and the plastic support that the left hinge screws into has broken.  The hinge is super tight so when you open the lid day after day it puts lots of tension on the plastic support which I discovered is poorly made. Also the plastic support that holds the power jack to the case on the left side is poorly made as well and has broken from normal plugging and unplugging. We first noticed the plug was lose but it was still charging so we didn't think much about it. However, eventually from the constant wiggling when plugging and unplugging, the ground wire soldered to the jack broke.  Luckily I found a cheap replacement power jack which I plan to hot glue in place but I'm still contemplating how I'm going to fix the hinge mounts.  The laptop is good but I just want people to be aware of what to expect after daily use of a cheap laptop.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just outstanding", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R2RIBJMX3PU1HQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There were som minor issues with the shipping.
