{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good video editing laptop", "Author": "GauloisUSA", "ReviewID": "RL49VLRCSSL2K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the MSI GP60 for video editing purpose. I wasn't sure if a gaming machine would fit the bill. but I went for it.First of all, the packaging was extremely nice.Then, I found out there is very little bloatware coming with this MSI laptop, so cleaning before use was a breeze.I find the plastic color and feel of this laptop to be very agreeable.The keyboard is practicable and pleasing to the touch.Now for the hardware.The sound coming out of its 2 front mounted speakers is powerful, but I had nothing in the past to refer to, so I can not comment on its validity as a gaming machine.IT IS SUPER FAST. On my last laptop, one of my editing software took 180 minutes (3hr) to render. The GP60 does it 10x faster. I almost fail out of my chair when it completed the job in only 15 minutes.DVD and sd card slot worked as expected.The screen seams a bit washed out. But it might be set for gaming.After only a few days working around the clock to set up this laptop to my needs, as you can tell, I am extremely impressed by it, but time will tell if it's reliable. So I will keep updating my review.", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best $1000 i ever spent on a latptop!", "Author": "Glenn", "ReviewID": "R39KNID6YSQ8FQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptops I knew from the minute I purchased it, I was going to be very pleased.
