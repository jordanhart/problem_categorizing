{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great hybrid tablet. Good value for mobile productivity and light gaming", "Author": "Jer", "ReviewID": "R2CYRYCF8SGKK8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this because I was looking for thin/light tablet to replace my current ipad/laptop combo. I needed a tablet with full Windows 8 so that I could run older programs and games. Besides the standard review, I will be updating this post with games that I find are playable on this Atom (Clover Trail) powered tablet.Playable games so far:Torchlight 1Battle for Middle Earth 2Farcry 1SNES Emulator: Using my iPhone as an SNES Controller.Elder Scrolls III: MorrowindPlaystation Emulator: Played a bit of FFVII, takes a lot of tweaking, but I got it to run smooth and look good. I haven't gotten the iPhone gamepad working with the emulator yet.Unplayable:World of WarcraftDiablo IIIBasically, any old strategy, puzzle, adventure game should work. Current generation games will need the i5 I think. I'll be trying more games on the Playstation 1 Emulator soon.Windows 8:When I first saw videos of windows 8 in action, I felt it was going to be Vista 2.0. After actually using it on a tablet, I feel it is the best OS for tablet computing. Switching between open programs, quickly seeing what is open, and having multiple programs up on the display at the same time is very easy to do. Some of these features are either difficult to do, or not possible on other mobile OS's. Powering on is very quick, even when the tablet is powered off completely. There is not much different between the iPad and Win8 in power-on times from a cold boot. For security, Windows 8 lets you login with a Windows Live ID, which syncs your settings across you're windows 8 devices (Backgrounds, passwords, etc). You can choose to use a standard password, or use a number (Pin) code (which is what I prefer for speed), or a picture login (you touch/swipe parts of the login picture and that is your password).The Start screen is filled with active tiles (as apposed to dead icons like the ipad) that cycle through relevant information (Email/News/Weather/etc.) without having to actually open those programs. Time/Date/Battery/Wifi info can be brought up at any time by swiping from the right side of the screen. I used to hate having to power-cycle my ipads display just to get the time/date. Start screen tiles can be arranged in groups to your liking. You can swipe from the left side of the screen to cycle through open programs, or see a list. You can grab any open program and either slide it to your main window, or snap it as a side-app next to your main window, either to the left or the right of the main window. As an example, I like having my email up in a side-window, while browsing the internet in the main window. No more having to switch to my email app. You could also put a movie on one of your side windows, or music. I wouldn't be surprised if Apple/Google add these features in the near future.The Windows desktop still exists, and is used mainly for legacy support for non-windows8 programs. Eventually all programs should have a Windows8 version that can run through the Start screen (aka metro interface). Until then, it is nice to know I can run Visual Studio, Photoshop, Morrowind =) , on my very portable tablet. As an IT professional, having a full version of Windows 8 is invaluable. Non-windows8 programs may run slow on these tablets with Atom processors, but it is a small trade-off to get a very thin and light tablet with a full version of windows 8.Battery Life:The battery seems to last forever on these Atom powered tablets. I can use it all day for work, play games during lunch, watch movies when I get home, all without having to plug it in. And because I can't play a lot of graphics intensive games (yet), this tablet Is far outlasting my iPad.Cost:In general Windows RT tablets are $500 for a 32GB version without a keyboard, and $600 with a keyboard. Upgrading to larger hard drives (64Gb/128GB) increase the cost as well. Windows RT will not be able to run old programs but they do use an ARM processor that has better graphics performance (for now). These Atom powered tablets are between $600 and $800. They start with 64GB hard drives, and some include a keyboard. Not all Atom tablets are the same. Some have digitizers, and some don't. I feel that the larger hard drive, digitizer, and full version of Windows 8 is worth an extra $50-$100 more over the Windows RT Tablets.Display:The display is nowhere near as good as the iPad 3/4s Retina display. But it is good enough for web browsing/email/MSoffice/light gaming. It is very bright, but hard to see under direct sunlight. I really wanted a 1900x1000+ display, but the cost is just too much. Overall I am happy with this tablets 1366x768 resolution. It is perfect for watching movies. If you do any kind of artsy graphics stuff, you may need to invest in the higher cost, more bulky i5 tablets until manufacturers see a larger demand from us for better displays, on thinner/lighter/cheaper tablets.Size:The size made me hesitate a bit before I bought this. Coming from an iPad, I was hoping for a tablet that had similar dimensions. The iPad seems more balanced for holding it with one hand by the edge of the tablet. This one is designed to be used primarily in landscape mode, but because it is so wide, it makes it hard to hold it by the edge. I have found that it is more comfortable to just hold it by placing my hand on the back of the tablet like holding a pizza. Some people may have to pass on these wide tablets due to the preference of holding the tablet by the edge of the screen. Functionally though, Windows 8 takes full advantage of the wide format for having multiple programs on the screen at the same time. The thickness is just about the same as the iPad, and I am happy with it. .38\" vs .37\"Sound:Amazing. Stereo speakers on the edges of the tablet in landscape mode. It's nice to finally have stereo sound on a tablet for watching movies, listening to music and playing games. Don't expect much bass.Weight:Very light. Just slightly heavier than the iPad 4. 1.65 lb. vs 1.44 lb. The wide format makes it seem heavier than it is though. I am leery of upgrading to the Surface Pro or any other i5 tablet because they start to reach 2 lb. or higher. I want my tablet to remain a tablet. Hopefully technology will advance quickly so that we can have thin/light/HD display tablets that have the power to play high quality 3d games and do artist stuff. For now, I opted to have a light tablet that makes sacrifices elsewhere.Digitizer:Coming from an iPad I did not know what I was missing. Not all of the Windows 8 tablets have a digitizer, so you will need to decide if you want one that does, and shop accordingly. This adds an extra layer to the display that detects the stylus (it shows a dot on the screen when the stylus gets close to the screen). Hovering over a program or icon is the same as hovering your mouse over a program on a Desktop PC. you don't have to touch the screen. Touching the screen is like a left-click on a mouse. Pressing the button on the Stylus while pressing the screen initiates a right-click. (These functions change depending on what program you are using). The digitizer used in the Samsung tablets is a Wacom, which I believe has 1024 points of pressure detection. This allows you to change the thickness of the lines depending how hard you are pressing on the screen. In note-taking programs, when the screen detects the stylus is close to the screen, the program will ignore youre palm, making it much easier to take notes. Some programs perform great with the digitizer, and some are slow/delayed. I think the Atom processer does a good job with processing digitizer input for the most part. For artists, I would say a digitizer is a must have. The stylus is kind of small, and it is stored in the case of the tablet. It is very difficult to remove and I think they should have improved on this. Overall, I am going to like notetaking a lot better from now on.Performance:The Intel Atom Clover Trail chip is optimized for windows 8, and battery life. Perfect for a productivity tablet. The built-in graphics processing unit (GPU) is faster than the iPad 2, but slower than the iPad 3/4. I believe this was to improve battery life, and cut down on costs. The drivers for the GPU need some work before it can play full screen 3D games at its full potential. Expect games to perform better after a driver update is released in the future. Advances in technology should allow Intel to provide a better gaming experience without sacrificing battery life, size, weight of the tablet. Aside from gaming, I am happy with the performance of the Atom. Metro apps are flawless. Older desktop apps can sometimes lag, but overall they work fine. I was able to watch full HD 1080p movies with no issues. Old games that don't rely on GPU's perform good. See my list of playable games for an example.Connectors/Ports:This has a full, built-in USB 2.0 port, and MicroSD slot, and a MiniHDMI port. The USB port is great for connecting Flash Drives/Hard Drives/ peripherals, without the need for an adaptor. I outfitted my MicroSD slot with a 64GB memory card where I Store my downloads/Music/Movies/Games. I have not tried the MiniHDMI port yet.My list of Cons:The Keyboard Dock is unavailable. Aftermarket covers with built-in stands are not available yet. I will be buying the Microsoft Wedge Mobile keyboard. The cover doubles as a stand for the tablet. This will be smaller than the official Dock making it easier to keep with me should I need it.As already discussed. The Graphics drivers could use an update to take full advantage of the GPU.The case is made out of plastic. It flexes and feels kind of cheap. This obviously does not effect the performance and features.That's it. There used to be issues with sound and the digitizer, but Samsung updates fixed them. Just run the Samsung updater when you get your tablet. A work-around is to disable the sound/digitizer in the Device Manager, and then re-enable them. Or just reboot.Note: If you royally mess up your tablet, you can restore it to factory defaults:Hold down the Volume-UP button while turning on the tablet to enter the Windows Troubleshooting utility.Also note that Windows Restore Points are not enabled by default. If you want to be able to go back to a certain point in time, do the following:To enable System Protection: Go to the desktop, swipe the screen from the right side to bring up the settings panel. Click on \"Control Panel\". Click on \"System and Security\" and then click on \"System\". Then select \"System Protection\". Then press the \"Configure\" button. Turn system protection on, then create a restore point right away. Installing updates does not automatically create a restore point like I thought it would. Just create a restore point before any system updates to be safe (not necessary for program updates)", "Date": "November 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exceeded My Expectations", "Author": "Jrhea", "ReviewID": "R1ZN3Q9RB18VHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As an owner of tablets before the ipad and all 3 ipad variations including the \"new\" ipad, I have always struggled to get rid of that feeling of it either being too cumbersome for use(pre-ipads), or just a toy with few cool uses(ipads).  I think with this tablet, I have finally found what I am looking for.  I am so happy with it, I am actually writing the first review I have ever done for a product.Ability to hook up common usb peripherals and use them?  Check - external DVD, USB stick were a breeze to use and install programs (.iso of software CD's, etc).  Flawless, and convenient.Ability to use the programs I have already purchased for my home machine?  Check - Office 2010, adobe photoshop, etc - they all worked without issue. I just can't emphasize how nice this is to finally have in a tablet.  I even put world of warcraft on for the heck of it - just because I could.Ability to expand through a Micro SD card?  Check - bought a 64GB class 10 card and have Apps installed on it (yes, you can install apps to the microSD card) as well as videos, games, MP3's and pictures.  Very handy, doesn't fill the O/S drive with unnecessary items.Great Screen?  Check - even coming from a retina ipad user.  Bright, vivid display with good sharp resolution.  The auto brightness is a tad harsh at times, but that can be adjusted in the power settings.Great battery?  Check - hours and hours of play each day for the last two days, and the remaining battery life frankly blew me away each night (60%+ available).  This is through installing programs, playing games, watching videos, surfing the web (can't count the number of times my son looped that gangum style song on you tube!?!).  Very impressed with battery life for a full featured machine.Windows 8?  Not as bad as I thought.  I was anticipating a train wreck that would take me a long time to get used to.  It is well done and feels good on the tablet.  Not sure I am up for putting it on my home machine yet, but on the tablet, it really goes a long ways to make it the experience it is.  Also, Samsung includes a program if you use the \"SW Updater\" that puts the start button functionality basically back on your desktop.  Samsung did a nice job with the pen that you get with the tablet as well - that thing is handy in OneNote, it can even read my terrible handwriting.  When you have to bounce to the desktop, it is also a nice feature to be able to use the pen and click, drag, right-click.  Not necessary, but nice none the less.Processor Speed? Again, not as bad as I thought.  I almost didn't buy it when I saw \"atom\".  Perhaps intel should change the name, because this processor actually performs well.  It seemed sluggish for the first few hours, but after that it has really been peppy.  Perhaps there were some things installing in the background, or maybe uninstalling Norton bloatware did it, but the performance of the Atom processor has exceeded my expectations.I think the build quality of the tablet is very nice - good clean edges, great sounding speakers that point toward you, well placed inputs on the edges.  As far as \"feel\" of the materials, I find it very similar to my wife's Galaxy S3.  It is lighter than I expected for the size, but the size poses issues I mention below (non-standard - nothing fits it).Negatives?  No docking station in stock anywhere - I mean I have tried all over.  No Cases and covers available for it yet.  I am currently using a $12 sleeve I bought at a discount retailer (actually fits nice, made by merkury) that will have to hold me over until I find something real.  The charger for it is like a laptop charger that plugs into the wall (has a mini brick).  I don't see any Car adapters for it available, and would guess it will be expensive as you can't seem to use a common USB type charger for it.Overall, those few negatives aside which time may fix, I love this thing. More than I expected.  Thanks Samsung and Microsoft for finally making the tablet I have been waiting for.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Spectacular Tablet, but Problems with Keyboard Dock Disconnects and Wifi", "Author": "Mitchell Underwood", "ReviewID": "R3N6CPH8IQ9I65", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this tablet with keyboard dock from Amazon on November 13 and experienced a number of problems, detailed in this review. However, I wanted to post my most recent experience at the top of the review so you can know what to expect if you buy the tablet today. My original review is posted below.Latest Update 12/17/2012:Samsung released driver updates at the end of last week for the chipset, sound card, and Bluetooth chip. I am glad to say that since those drivers were released, nearly every problem I've had with the tablet has been resolved. Sound is now 100% reliable with no clicking from the speakers, wifi connects reliably every time, and there seem to be no more random freeze ups. The keyboard dock has gradually become more reliable to the point where it has not disconnected in days (I think the connector just needs to \"break in\" a bit.) I have been pleased enough with this tablet over the last week that I ordered two additional units, one for the lab I work in, and another as a gift. The unit for the lab did experience keyboard disconnects at first, but over several days of use they have declined just like they did with mine. Like any first generation device, this one did have a few rough edges at first, but I'm impressed that Samsung has relatively quickly released updated drivers that solve nearly all the problems. For now I am leaving my review at 2 stars so that this review remains as the \"most helpful critical review\", but eventually I will update the rating to reflect my current feelings. If you have been eyeing this tablet and hesitating to buy it because of the reported problems, go ahead and buy it. If you run the included SW Update utility to get all the latest drivers, you will be very happy with the Samsung Ativ Smart PC.Original Review:I purchased the version with the keyboard dock from Amazon on October 29, and received it November 13. The tablet itself is everything it's made out to be, but the keyboard dock has a major problem. While comfortable to type on, it has a terrible problem where the connection between the keyboard and the screen is lost randomly while typing. The problem occurs most frequently when the system is resting on my lap, as opposed to on a desk. It is made worse if I use the touch screen before typing, or if my legs are angled downward. I believe the issue lies in a poorly designed docking connector on the keyboard. While the tablet does \"lock\" into place, it is not locked tightly enough to ensure a secure and reliable connection. When the problem occurs, a firm press to push the tablet back into the dock usually resolves it, but it's really annoying to have to do this constantly. In addition, when the keyboard connection is lost, so are the USB ports on the keyboard dock. I've already suffered failed file transfers while installing programs due to this issue.For the time being, I will keep the tablet and see whether this becomes a serious issue, or whether it's just an intermittent annoyance. However, I cannot recommend the tablet/keyboard dock combination to anyone since Samsung is charging a $100 premium for a keyboard dock that simply doesn't work properly.UPDATE 11/16/2012I've used the tablet for a few days now, and my initial disappointment has been tempered somewhat by the amazingness of the tablet itself, as well as by discovering a method to reduce the frequency of the keyboard disconnects. First, regarding the keyboard dock. I discovered that if I firmly press the keyboard into the dock and then push the tablet to the right in order to fully engage the latching mechanism, the frequency of keyboard disconnects is reduced dramatically. I was initially experiencing keyboard disconnects nearly every 30 seconds, but after starting to push the tablet to the right when docking with the keyboard, the disconnects have decreased to maybe once or twice per day. It seems like taking a second every now and then to ensure the tablet is securely docked does a lot to prevent the disconnects.Now, I haven't said anything about the tablet itself yet. Quite simply, it's amazing. There are a few minor issues that will probably be resolved with driver updates including occasionally glitchy Windows sound effects (resolved by reboot), and an unreliable S Camera app (though the Microsoft camera app works fine). The tablet is extremely fast and does not at all feel like an Atom processor. Websites load quickly and scrolling is smooth. The wifi signal strength is great, and it connected to my university's WPA-Enterprise encrypted network without a hitch (previous tablets I've had have struggled with this). The ambient light sensor is acceptable, though not the best (running SW Update to get the latest driver improves it a lot compared to the driver the computer ships with). The extremely wide, glossy screen looks spectacular and is great for viewing HD content (unlike the iPad's 4:3 screen). HD videos from Youtube and elsewhere play back perfectly.  I was also impressed with the quality of the speakers. Despite having a super-thin slate form factor, the 2x0.8W speakers sound incredible - better than many laptops I've used, and the volume is louder than you'd expect to get from a device of this type. I was also impressed with the tablet's ability to play MP3's over Bluetooth audio (A2DP) while the computer is in sleep mode, and also how  resume from sleep mode is literally instant (no more 5-10 second wait like on most Windows 7 PC's.) The inking experience is great, just like you'd expect from any Wacom-powered tablet, and it's very convenient to be able to store the stylus inside the computer. The included stylus is short (crayon size) and does not have an eraser, so beware that to erase ink in the free Microsoft OneNote app, you will either need to rely on the Undo command or select and delete the ink manually (there is no eraser tool in the free OneNote app, unlike the full Office 2013 OneNote). Another option if you're inking often is to purchase a full size Wacom stylus that includes an eraser on the top. (The tablet DOES recognize the eraser on other Wacom styluses, I tested it.) This resolves the issue with erasing ink in the free OneNote, and is also more comfortable to write with.Overall, my feelings about this system have changed drastically from when I first posted the angry review about the keyboard issue, so I'm increasing my rating to 4 stars. The missing star is for the occasional keyboard disconnects, and the lingering driver issues with the camera and the sound card. I'll post another update if I discover anything new!UPDATE 11/25/2012:A new annoying problem has started to occur on my tablet. The wifi will frequently fail to connect when I turn the tablet on. I'm subtracting a star because of this. It often takes 2-3 attempts of cycling Airplane Mode on/off to get it to connect. I've tried uninstalling/reinstalling the driver to no avail. Hoping a driver update fixes this, because other than the wifi issue I am loving my tablet. Even the keyboard disconnects that bothered me originally have been less and less frequent. I credit that mostly to me being more conscious of whether the tablet is securely seated in the dock, and pushing it in every now and then to make sure.UPDATE 12/2/2012The wifi problem has continued. Yesterday it took me a full 10 minutes of playing with the Airplane Mode toggle, connecting/disconnecting, sleep/wake, restart, and full shutdown/restart, before it finally connected. I have an email in to Samsung support about this issue, but have not received a response yet. If you search for \"Samsung Ativ Wonky Wifi\", you'll find a professional review of the tablet that also mentions this issue. This wifi problem is really ruining the fun with this unit. At least the keyboard dock issue could be quickly fixed when it occurred by pushing the tablet into the keyboard dock, but this wifi issue has no easy solution and is extremely disruptive. I'm subtracting another star, and I'm thinking about subtracting another, especially if Samsung support can't help out.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Absolutely blows Android out of the water", "Author": "JL", "ReviewID": "R1HHXEFRN8IJ44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Coming from an Android, I must say this product is fantastic. Mine is extremely fast, without lag on all Metro apps, and the majority of x86 apps (word, excel, onenote..)However, the standard x86 PDF reader (Adobe Acrobat) does lag a bit.. no worries though - the Metro PDF viewer is excellent.EDIT I've changed the Adobe settings to .show current page only. and now it doesnt lag at all, even on my ginourmous PDFsThe digital pen is AWESOME. I had no idea what I was missing out on when I was using my capacitive-only Android. The pen is exceptional in the desktop mode because in desktop mode, icons are slightly small (11.6 inch vs 13/14/15 inch screens on regular laptops) and easy to mis-press when using the finger.My tablet had no lag whatsoever during inking in onenote, samsung note, and MS Paint. I don't use photoshop, so I can't say anything about that.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT YOU GET THIS TABLET WITHOUT THE KEYBOARD.Keyboard is ~100 bucks extra and several reviews have mentioned problems about the keyboard falling out.What I've done is get a $10 USB keyboard (Bluetooth works as well) and a  1-to-4 USB expander so I can use the keyboard while using flash drives and such.

It runs great without any major glitches! Of course, it's not going to break any speed records, but it's not sluggish at all. It does creak when you pick it up from one side, but so do many other Samsung devices. The hardware is adequate for what this tablet is designed for. The more expensive sibling, the Ativ SmartPC Pro, is faster with more RAM and storage at the expense of weight, battery life and heat generation.Once you start using it and realize that this is a full-blown computer in your hands running full Office, Adobe suite, proper web browser with full flash and more, you won't go back to any other tablets such as iPad or Androids. Furthermore, if you are into inking and taking notes, S-Note or OneNote are perfect with the included stylus.

Henry \"Byshop\"", "ReviewID": "R17A7Q0IE29MPQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:*Intel's new much faster Atom CPU that's x86 compatible and can run full Windows. Comes with Windows 8 but can be upped to Pro with a key. Full Windows means can run anything that it's fast enough or has enough ram to handle. So far all productivity apps I've tried work. I have full Office 2013 installed and I can run Onenote, Outlook, Excel, and Lync at the same time with no issue.*Weight and size is comparable to a normal droid/ios/win RT tablet (Atom version is 1.68 lbs, whereas the iPad ran from about 1.6 to 1.3 depending on the generation/configuration)*Battery life is on par with a droid/ios/Win RT tablet (I've been using mine literally all day for notes in meetings. Active non-game usage seems to eat the battery about 6 minutes per 1% or 10% an hour or 10 hours total life. MUCH better than one of the i3/i5/i7 tablets which will get less than half that.*One USB port, one Micro HDMI port, one micro SD card slot. Not all the pending Atom units have Micro-HDMI on the tablet itself.Cons:*Slower than a traditional x86 platform device*11.6\" widescreen form factor may be a bit wide for some people*Not 1080p (1366x768)*Not as bright as the crazy bright models of the Transformer (this runs at 400nits)*Keyboard dock does not contain and additional battery like the Asus units*Driver support is weak right now, particularly for video. 1080p hardware accelerated playback is supported by the chipset but is software decoded for most formats right now which eats a lot of CPU. 720p is also software decided right now but the CPU is fast enough to handle it with no frame droppage in a player like VLC. Games that use full screen panning play unacceptably slow such as Limbo. Even a lot of RT games that claim compatibility with ARM tablets run slow, although the RT versions of these games introduce detail level settings that can be adjusted manually. Both of these situations will likely improve with driver updates. Also sometimes the S-pen doesn't work after hibernation which requires a reboot or restart of the affected service.*No USB 3.0 support (not supported by the chipset)*Only one USB 2.0 port on the device itself (the keyboard adds two more)*No SATA controller like the i3/i5/i7 units so SSD data transfer rates will top out around 15MB per second. Storage is essentially flash media rather than true SSD.*Full Windows is a bit big for a 64GB storage volume (you'll almost certainly want to add a MicroSD card additional for storage)*S-pen when fully inserted into the slot can be stupidly stiff. While this means you won't lose it, I've actually scratched the pen trying to remove it. (update: this is not true with every unit)*Made of plastic versus aluminum.While the above cons list is longer than the pros list (and I'm not even touching the pros/cons of Windows 8, just the device itself and how it's supported) let me be clear that I love this tablet. As a replacement for a laptop, it's piss poor. While the new Atom is fast it doesn't compare to a modern laptop. However, if your usage is light then it's a non-issue. Ever since I first bought an iPad 1 about 2-3 years ago I lamented the fact that literally everything I wanted to do I had to find an app in the iOS store (or other places) that let me do what I could already do on a PC. Remote Desktop, direct file transfer, printing, reading comics, movie playback, etc all required specific new apps, transcoding or in some cases just weren't possible. With this device not only do I get all the back, but it's true Windows so I can multitask everything. The wide screen lets me watch a video on the left half while I read IE on the other half. The Atom CPU is no speed demon and has to SATA support, but the OS cold boots in seconds anyway (much faster than my iPad boots) and while overall video driver support is weak right now natively supported apps like IE, Word, Excel, Explorer all scroll smooth as silk.I also like to game. While of course this is no gaming rig I wanted to see how it played games. If you want to play games you'll be limited to older, indy or 2d games mostly. Point and click adventure titles run pretty well but the touchscreen may not register properly for these games. Here are some results:Limbo - Unplayable (low frame rate)Braid - Choppy but playable. Some areas are worse than othersBastion - Unplayably slowSam and Max series - plays great, albeit in a frame. doesn't stretch to fill the screenWorld of Goo - plays greatBejewelled 3 - drops some frames during explosions but otherwise plays great. Also no issues with the touch screen.Broken Sword - Plays fine, sometimes single clicks don't register using the touchscreenCrayon Physics Deluxe - Plays fineGemini Rue (and presumably all the Wadjet Point and Click games like the Blackwell series) - performs fine but clicking with the touchscreen is tricky. I also noticed the same behavior when I used to play this game from my iPad via SplashtopFTL - slightly slow but very playable, although when playing this game I get occasional video driver crashes. Intel dropped a new driver through the Samsung updater yesterday and I haven't tried it since thenGratuitous Space/Tank Battles - little slow but playable. touchscreen control mostly works but scrolling the battlefield is quirkySuper Meat Boy - CrashesSpace Pirates and Zombies - playable but slightly slowHome - Plays goodLone Survivor - Plays goodOriginal X-Com - plays in a frame and touchscreen controls do not workTorchlight - Playable at lower resolutions (around 25fps at 1024x768)Games requiring full screen panning currently have issue. Apps that are natively supported by the OS can scroll smooth as silk such as IE and Office 2013 apps, so driver support will likely fix this issue in time. Games with relatively static backgrounds, however, work fine. Point and click adventure games (minus any touchscreen issues) and puzzle games are great.Bottom line: This is a great tablet replacement that's even capable of replacing a netbook or other laptop option provided you aren't using resource intensive apps. Video processing or transcoding, sound editing, movie editing, etc are all a bit beyond the reach of an Atom CPU with 2GB of RAM, but Office apps work great. If you are looking for a tablet that is capable of much more than an iOS or Droid device then this is a great option. If you're looking for the power of a proper laptop, then you'll need to go with something like the Ativ Pro or Surface Pro but understand that you do so at the cost of at least half the battery life.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "The tablet for students", "Author": "Lizard King", "ReviewID": "R3TY7TUG2S3KWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before I review the product, I would like to state my intended use for the tablet, so that you can understand better my angle of view. I'm a graduate student. I already have a high performance laptop with a big monitor to watch movies, play games, run big simulations, or do image processing. Therefore, I mainly need the tablet to carry around, read docs, and take notes (organize them and share them or archive them).With this in mind, things that do matter to me are:(1) Long battery life. This kills any tablets that use core-i processors, which consume much more power. (10h vs 4h battery life)(2) Windows 8 (not Windows RT). The problem with the new Microsoft OS is that it doesn't have many apps at the moment. However, having an OS that is compatible with any x86 software instantly bypasses this problem, and in my mind, is a much superior option. To name a few, you can use MS Office with its full functions, or use your favorite browser, or listen to spotify using the desktop version (even though spotify hasn't yet published an app for Windows RT).(3) Wacom stylus (s pen). As I understand, tablets with innate support for Wacom stylus have a extra layer in their screen so that they can register the position of the stylus even when it's not touching the screen. They are also much more precise than capacitive stylus.So does this tablet actually deliver these promises? I give a definite answer: Yes.The new windows 8 is fun to use and quite smooth. It does take a few minutes to learn the tricks, as many functions are hidden on the edges of the screen, but I soon got used to that. I did run into a few hiccups in my 2 days test, but they are not overly annoying or distracting, and I believe Microsoft will soon fix them.The S pen of the tablet makes digital inking really feasible. I didn't use the S note application that Samsung provides, but used MS OneNote 2010, and it really shines. The precision of the stylus is quite good.(If it is slightly off, you can calibrate it in Windows 8) You can write fairly small, yet still readable. When you use the stylus, you can use your finger to navigate the pages, which is very convenient. The ink to text function in OneNote recognizes 99% of my handwriting when I write pretty fast. Even if you don't specifically change ink to text, the inking is still searchable in the program, which is another big plus.The screen doesn't have high resolution like some high-end ones, but it's high enough to support Windows 8 Snap feature. It's bright, with good contrast. I tested the camera, but wasn't very satisfied. The pictures doesn't look sharp, and it's difficult to focus at the right spot. But again, these are features that are of minor importance to me.To sum up, this should not be considered as a personal PC replacement, and it's not designed to be one. However, if you simply want a tablet to carry around, read some documents, and take notes, this is definitely the right choice for you. Admittedly, the price is a bit on the high end at the moment, and in six month there will be next generation products that are faster and cheaper. But there will always be better ones further ahead.Pros: Windows 8 (not RT), S pen, long battery lifeCons: Screen resolution, Camera", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Better than I had expected", "Author": "Thomas C. Nowak", "ReviewID": "R3CCO04O5OFF71", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As many others, I questioned the capability of a tablet powered by an ATOM Intel processor.  Netbooks powered by the Atom often were quite underpowered and tedious towork with.  But the ATIV Smart PC (with its dual core Atom and Windows 8) is a pleasant surprise.  It is quick.  Windows open and close quickly and apps launch quickly.I installed Office, ITunes, PowerDVD, and had no problems running any of the aforementioned programs.  Microsoft crippled the media player (too few codecs), but willrectify that situation by offering a free Media Center update.  The ATIV tablet has a large screen with sufficient resolution of make viewing pleasant.  A regular sized USB port isa welcome addition to a tablet.  The onscreen keyboard is large and easy to type on.  One can install legacy apps by simply attaching a USB thumb drive or a portableDVD drive, or downloading files from the internet.  Since the ATIV Smart PC only has a 64 gig hard drive, one needs to be careful not to overload the system withapps and media files.  But the USB port makes it easy to add video files via a thumb drive.  Battery life also seem quitegood (around 6-7 hours of normal use) since the ATOM is very energy efficient.  While a tablet with a third generation, I3, I5,or I7 would not doubt be faster, it probably would have a shorter battery life in a tablet as thin and light as the ATIV Smart PC.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet for mobility", "Author": "T. Grandon Gill", "ReviewID": "R1D75IJXG8U040", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had the Samsung for about 3 weeks now, and have been extraordinarly pleased with it overall. This is my fifth tablet PC (I acquired my first in 2003 and have used one ever since) and it seems to me that the 500T comes very close to \"the ideal\" in terms of what a tablet is most useful for. Specifically:1) It has an excellent battery life (10+ hours, and maybe more)2) It is very light3) Its performance is admirable (for the MS-Office, Acrobat and browser applications that I would typically use it for)4) Its price is remarkably low for what it delivers5) Its pen performance is smooth and naturalFor me, the last of these is the most aspect of a tablet. I teach at a university and have always used my tablets to take notes in meetings, for inking comments on student papers, for creating video instructional content that involves drawings and for reading/annotating articles. I have found that other so-called tablets--such as the iPad, which I also own--are good for entertainment but, lacking a stylus, are unsuitable for any of these activities.Even touch-screen tablets can be problematic when used in conjunction with the pen, since putting your hand on the screen while writing can be interpreted as inking. MS-OneNote does a pretty good job of figuring out which you are using, but other pen-enabled applications, such as MS-Word, do not always get it right. On my Windows 7 Dell XT2 tablet, I permanently disabled the touch screen in Control Panel. In Windows 8, however, that checkbox option no longer appears to exist, which caused me considerable consternation. Fortunately, the Samsung provides its own option in its \"Settings\" application; my only complaint is that you have to restart the computer in order to switch between the two modes. Another of the Samsung built-in applications provides a substitute for the now-missing start menu, which is convenient for those of us just getting started on Windows 8.When I acquired the Samsung ATIV 500T, I also purchased two other accessories that I feel are indispenable. The first was a class 10 64GB microSD card, which doubled my storage capacity and makes it easy for me to move documents around. The second was a Logitech bluetooth tablet keyboard. I chose this over a docking station for three reasons: 1) it was cheaper, 2) its stand (which is also its keyoard case) allows me to use the tablet in portrait mode, and 3) a number of reviewers had complained about problems with the docking connection. The only problem I had with the keyboard was that when I also tried to use a bluetooth mouse with it, the two interfered with each other enough so that I decided to use USB for the mouse instead.Some comments on issues:A number of reviewers complained about their wireless Internet connection dropping out. That happened to me for a couple of days but since then it has been perfect. It may be that some of the many updates I downloaded fixed that problem.The first time I connected the microHDMI to my TV, nothing happened--which was disappointing. I acquired a different cable, however, and it worked perfectly. Since that time, I concluded that the original cable I purchased (which was quite inexpensive) may have been vendor specific, since it was listed as \"Cable Matters 10 feet Premium GOLD Plated Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable for HTC, Motorola and other portable devices with Micro HDMI port\".Minor complaints:Nothing is perfect, but there is only one real complaint that I have. Although the device comes with a 64GB SSD drive, it looks as if over 10 GB is used for a hidden restore partition and anothe 20+ GB is consumed by the operating system (and more than a little \"crapware\"). While I could have doubtless reformatted the drive and done a clean Windows 8 install, that looked to be more of an adventure than I was up for. At a minimum, why not put the restore on a microSD or USB stick?I would also say that the stylus, which fits into the case, is about as comfortable for writing as a golf pencil and does not have the eraser end. While I give them kudos for fitting it into the case, I'd view it as suitable for writing only in an emergency. Fortunately, the tablet works perfectly with a stylus from my old Acer. Another reviewer mentioned that it worked with a different Wacom stylus. The nice thing is that these other styluses (styli?) is that they have an eraser end that works with OneNote and Journal (although I had less luck with MS-Word).One other observation, which seems more related to Windows 8 as opposed to being specific to the Samsung, is that it does not do a very good job figuring out when you need the on-screen keyboard. Earlier tablets recognized when you were going to enter text (e.g., on a web form) and supplied an icon that made it easy to bring up the keyboard. Although I may just be missing a setting, I find I always have to go to the status bar to get the on-screen keyboard when I need it.Other than that, it would be \"nice\" if it had a faster processer, more RAM (it comes with 2 GB and cannot be upgraded), a larger SSD drive (it comes with 64 GB) and could run 64 bit Windows applications. Of course, that describes the 700T model--so these are apparently available for about $500 more. Realistically, however, these features would come with their own price tag: shorter battery life. Given what I plan use this device for, I might even place a higher priority on mobility than on these other features, given that its performance is already quite satisfactory.So... for $600, this strikes me as being one heck of a device.", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent, if flawed", "Author": "Bradley S. Bridgewater", "ReviewID": "RHND8CI4172MU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my ATIV 500T and have seen no other tablet, except maybe the HP Envy X2, that would meet my needs for a tablet.  However, I have to admit that the ATIV has two flaws that might make it unsuitable for some.  First and foremost, the thing hangs on going into or out of the suspend state much too often.  This hasn't been more than an annoyance for me: I just press and hold the power button until the light goes out and then press again to reboot, which is so fast (about 20 seconds) that I'm back up and running within a minute.  However, if you are someone who leaves unsaved work product open in an application without using the tablet long enough for the suspend timer to kick in, this flaw could cause lost work.  Second, as noted by other reviewers, the bluetooth keyboard connection is definitely flaky and unreliable.  This hasn't been a problem for me because I've found I can do everything I want to do with the tablet without using a keyboard.  I have other machines to use if I want to use a keyboard.  For me, the main point of having a tablet is to get rid of the keyboard anyway.  The real value of the ATIV is that it comes with a stylus and good digitizer screen, and yet can run most legacy Windows programs.  I use it mainly (1) to keep handwritten notes in OneNote and Evernote, and (2) to edit photos in the GIMP (32-bit version 2.8.2).  The tablet is simply a joy to use for these purposes.  There is sometimes a bit of lag on very complex GIMP processing, but not so much as to be, for me, annoying. The tablet is also entirely adequate for checking my Hotmail in the standard Windows 8 Mail app and Yahoo! mail in that company's own app, and for browsing a wide variety of news sources, either in the standard Bing apps, or in other apps available in the Windows Store.  I have even been able to run some legacy Windows games on the tablet, although I admit it takes some learning to figure out how to play them without a mouse.  Civilization 4 (all editions) ran fine, but you would need to add a USB or bluetooth mouse to be able to enjoy it.  However, I have been able to build cities in SimCity 4 using only the stylus.  I have not tried to install Steam and suspect the tablet's graphics could not handle it.  I have also used the tablet for listening to music and watching movies (I keep all of these media files on a 64G microSD).  Amazon Unbox installed and runs just fine.  For trips, I set it to download the movie files to the media card.  The ATIV has wonderful battery life: easily lasts for a whole day of any use I've been able to find for it.  I got the Poetic leather case for the tablet, which looks very professional and makes the tablet look and feel like an ordinary portfolio.  I take it to court instead of a legal pad to take notes.  My bottom line is that, as a transitional device for getting into the tablet future without losing essential elements of the desktop/laptop past, the ATIV 500T is perfectly suited, -- so long as you don't actually expect perfection.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good compared to the competition", "Author": "Kyle \"cylem\"", "ReviewID": "R3E7WWMFK3RHTD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Well I think my review has an edge since I have also tried out the Acer W510 and the Acer W700, one which is similar in a bit of a smaller package and one that is more like an ultrabook.To start off one great thing this tablet has over the acer and asus competition is a stylus, it works wonders when using certain applications and getting around in desktop mode. Its easier to select things and right click on areas. The stylus has had no issues so far and is greatly appreciated.Now a key difference between the W510 and the ATIV is the 10.6 vs 11.6 inch screen. Honestly I prefer the smaller screen, it's easier to hold though it's not a deal breaker, samsungs screen looks every bit as good as the w510's IPS screen and has good viewing angles too.Performance wise is the same as the W510, the metro interface is super smooth, browsing is great, videos work flawless, old games work fine (torchlight rollercoaster tycoon 2, peggle) Some games have compatability issues but alot of old ones work great. However some games in the windows app store like angry birds seem to have issues where there is alot of slow down, I believe they just need some optimization work. In desktop mode its not flying but it's not to shabby, I can get around pretty decent and most normal applications should work as expected. The W700 is a different beast, no speed problems in any windows store app, and it can even play games like skyrim. It also has a real SSD unlike the W510 and the ATIV which has has Emmc memory which is a bit faster than a normal spinning drive but nowhere near an SSD.Battery life on the W510 and ATIV were about the same averaging 10 hours or so, the W700 was closer to 6 or 7 though.For accessories the W700 came with a dock and bluetooth keyboard which I liked alot actually. The W510 has a keyboard mount with a built in battery, and the ATIV has the keyboard mount that doesn't have a batter, so samsung loses out on this one, huge fail there.For ports the W510 has a micro usb port, micro sd, micro hdmi, headphone jack. W700 has a full usb 3.0, micro hdmi, headphone jack. The ATIV has a full usb, micro sd, micro hdmi, and headphoneOverall I decided I liked the ATIV the most, I don't really need the power of the W700 since I have my laptop, I didn't think the sacrifice of batter life and portability justified it unless I was replacing my laptop all together also it lacks SD storage. The W510 was great size and function however the lack of stylus was a minus as well as lacking a full usb port.

KEYBOARD WON'T STAY CONNECTED!I repurchased this unit from Amazon after first receiving a defective unit and was so pleased with all the updates that solved all my issues I left an overwhelmingly stellar review (below), though I finally receive my keyboard dock from Staples, thinking perhaps the dock disconnect issue was unique to Amazon's stock - well folks, it's not Amazon's stock, it's just Samsung dock (had to throw the rhyme in)!This issue is not homogeneous to the dock itself, as I tried another Bluetooth keyboard and it disconnects just the same, so it's definitely a defect and with all the updates and fixes that came out making the tablet by itself a pleasure to use, the fact that this keyboard disconnect issue has not been solved is leading me to believe the tablet is just simply defective hardware ridden. That being said, I LOVE this tablet, when using as just a tablet, though I purchased it as a full laptop replacement and without the Keyboard dock working, productivity is greatly diminished and renders some tasks impossible altogether.Now my question I will beg of anyone to answer if they can: Does anyone know of a way to remedy this, unofficial update or driver, outside the box ways to 'rig it up' or anything of this nature? I would HATE to have to return this tablet again after falling in love with the thing, not to mention the possibility of harming my Amazon standing for having returned the same unit twice (is this even allowed?). I'm at a loss here. If anyone can help me at all, I'd be extremely grateful! The official description from Samsung markets it as a desktop/laptop replacement, but without the keyboard dock I can't even copy and paste (in chrome at least) and I'm not even going to attempt typing 40-50 page reports on a touch screen keyboard that blocks half the document from view. At this point I can conclude it's hardware or driver failure that Samsung has no fix for, so I'm looking for any kind of a fix; I love this tablet so much I'm willing to have a rigged up one, rather than not have one at all.PLEASE HELP, SOMEONE! Different model's driver, a tinfoil hat, etc. Like I said, I'm open to ANY suggestion to get the dock to stay connected!Intel ATOM is no longer what you may think. If Intel would have called it a 'Core-A' processor, 98% of PC users would know the difference from an i3 except that somehow the battery is lasting all day long, and I mean ALL day long. Clovertail would easily be mistaken for a 5th generation ATOM, if someone were to go back in time 5 years with one of these tablets.*EDIT* 2/22/2013 - I have re-purchased this tablet and Samsung has fixed every single issue and it now operates perfectly. I have not had even a single, not even one, issue. I now use this as my main computer, my desktop (with wireless keyboard and HDTV), as my laptop and you guessed it, as my tablet. I did this without compromise. 95-98% of us PC users do not need anything more powerful than a clovertail ATOM, to experience full windows 8 without ANY hiccups whatsoever.Here are some really helpful hints, actually must-dos if you purchase this unit:(1) Open it up, plug it in and before you do anything, complete all updates. This will take a while, but be patient or and do it first, or you will hate life.(2) Heard the 14.5 hour battery life myth? Well it's no myth! Read on..(This one is optional, but I HIGHLY recommended it): After the tablet has been fully charged (mine both came fully charged I just topped up to be sure when doing updates, which you must plug in the tablet for anyways. Purchase a micro HDMI cord ($2) and a Logitech K400 wireless keyboard/touch sensitive gesture friendly touch pad combo when you buy the tablet; you will now have a complete desktop experience that is 10X better than the clamshell experience and 5x cheaper; plug it up to a HDTV and select hardware setting in control panel, then screen/monitor, then display onto a second monitor and then select, this is key, display on second monitor/display only. From there you will have FULL 1080 HD crystal clear and insanely sharp display. (Also make sure to change the sleep function in control panel to not sleep ever for this operation) Without using only the second display setting, it will be about 60% as good; the difference is dramatic to say the least, then you may play with the unit and do what ever you like, download stuff, explore, etc, etc; just make sure, now this is the punch line, to use it like this until the battery is completely depleted; You may have to leave it like that overnight or all day, because this will take a good 15 plus hours (or perhaps the magic number, 14.5). Doing this 'cycle' two or three times is key, however even once is better than never. You will now have the longest lasting battery, under any circumstances, plugged in or not, that you have ever experienced. Some brainiac is surely furious behind his keyboard screaming that the battery is of this or that capacity and this will not make it better, well I beg to differ! As an executive I have little time on my hands, though I am so excited about this that I took the time to write it, because it DOES work. I did this on two separate units, so it is not just a fluke unique to my unit.(3) ENJOY! (I have already blabbed on and on about everything else about this machine)(4) Overall experience has led me to ditch my x202 i3 ASUS and the ATIV 700T, as this unit does every single task I need it for just as fast (nano seconds overlooked happily). You get the insane battery life, the same performance despite the core i5 hype as on any modern laptop - this is of course to say that if you do not need this machine for intensive gaming, video editing, or like demanding programs, under which circumstances you would not be looking at this unit anyways; for word processing, email, video chat/VOIP, surfing the net, researching, etc, (what 98% of people use a laptop for, this unit is indistinguishable (again not minding the nano seconds) from the 700T and at half the price! I got mine for $549 right here. You also get the FULL HD experience when projecting onto a monitor. With the 700T I had to actually lower the resolution to make the desktop mode usable. For normal computing, you do not want the 1080 display! For looking at pictures or watching movies(on your tablet only), maybe, but at sacrificing half the battery life? Gimme a break, no thanks!ALTERNATIVE: if the size and weight are an issue, the ASUS ME400 is a great alternative for even less than this (mind you there will be no digitizer). I got the ME400 for taking in the car and things of that nature; bottom line is the stigma of ATOM processors will be no more, VERY shortly. These things blaze (correlation with low power consumption considered).(Update 1/21/2013) I changed this from 2 stars, to 5 stars and after 10 days, am sticking with 4 stars; I no longer think it's the best convertible value available, but hope that soon it will be. Until then I have no choice but to return it and buy something predictable; this is a machine, not a moody assistant (or is it?). The following paragraph begins my 5 star review and I title the update before the bottom three paragraphs, post the most intense love-hate relationship I have ever had with a machine.Let me start off by saying after some tweaking and updates: this is hands down the best computer in the world! I was cursing this thing out of the box, as it seemed a huge joke as nothing was working right and if it did anything at all, it was at a snails pace; it reminded me of a 10 year old computer running Windows 98! Though after a dozen updates and some well worth the time research I now would not trade this computer for any other device out there, not a chance!I bought both the 500T and the 700T second, as I was determined to have a full laptop replacement in tablet form; like others, I have been anxiously awaiting the future of technology to make it a reality and the future is now -- THANKS SAMSUNG!First off, cost aside (made no difference to me as work was reimbursing me), the 500T is the better device and the one I will be keeping. I know some tech article reading person may beg to differ, but I'm talking real world use, replacing a go to desktop or laptop with a tablet PC. The 700T has a nice screen and the processor is way superior, on paper (emphasis on paper).A tablet should have amazing battery life, the 500T does, in fact it blows the 700T out of the water! The 500T provided all day battery life, with 10+ hours of real world use (14.5hr claims are floating around and they may be closer to reality than exaggeration); the 700T's battery life is a joke, really, for the price that joke is cemented.And what about weight? I want a light weight tablet and I feel confident that I can speak for the vast majority when I say they do too. Again, the 500T blows away the 700T, simply no comparison!This new generation dual core Atom processor is MUCH better than I expected, though out of the box you may find yourself thinking otherwise, at first, because software bugs (before you update) will make the processor appear to be crappy, it's not! In fact, for everything I've tried, it's almost as fast as the i5 in the 700T (again, think real world use). I say it's on par with a core i3 for most tasks, slower yes, though not enough to make the 500T undesirable, at all. Plus this new generation of Atom processors, uses so little energy, it makes the AMAZING BATTERY LIFE, possible. At first I swore Atom processors were for toys at best, but today, I proudly call it my go to processor. A tablet should be zippy and responsive and the 500T is! The Atom will handle even intensive programs like Photoshop, albeit a bit slower than the 700T, but you must ask yourself what percent of the time will you be using this for Photoshop and other intensive programs, before you decide how much the split second difference of rendering your input command matters.The digitizer and S-Pen; can we say Amazing! After having owned and returned the Galaxy Note 10.1, I can say the 11.6 real estate makes a huge difference for the everyday user like myself (I can see artists being thrilled!) and it feels much more responsive and overall better than the Note.I can't say I wouldn't have preferred brushed aluminum, though the plastic is by no means, cheap and it does appear to be brushed aluminum with the finish Samsung chose for the 500t.Resolution: Yes I did really like the full HD screen of the 700T, but in no way was it worth sacrificing the battery life of the 500T. The 500T is super bright  and crisp, and despite the 1366 number, I love the screen. When you output the HDMI into a full 1080p monitor or TV, it displays in 1080, which since I use a 32\" 1080p display when at home as my monitor, is a huge plus for me.The A/C adapter, though not as big as a full size laptop charger, is bigger than say my Asus X202e (Tablet style/size A/C adapter), which I would have preferred. Though again, not a deal breaker. Considering you most likely will not even need to bring the charger with you, it's not a big deal at all.Dock: the dock feels cheap to a point; I much prefer the Logitech wireless keyboard with the built in touch pad with multi touch gestures (k400 model for only 29$). This keyboard with a arrowhead Griffen stand ($5 Amazon) is the way I like it. It appears to be a very futuristic desktop, that you can pick up and use as a tablet at any moment; it's lighter and I have a full size keyboard and don't have to compromise my typing speed or get used to a little keyboard (and hey it's WAY CHEAPER).Bottom line is if you are purchasing this after January 10th, 2013, the bug fixes, via updates, are available and after you update and remove some bloatware, this will be your dream device if you are looking for a true tablet that can actually replace your desktop or laptop for actual productivity and creation. I had the choice to keep this or the 700T, or any other full Windows tablet, convertible, etc and I chose the 500T and in no way do I feel like I 'settled'.In conclusion, this is now my dream PC. It's Zippy and capable and has the best battery life of any tablet I've ever encountered and I've used all of the best out there. It's super light weight compared to any other comparable full Windows tablet and it is 11.6\", which is sweet for using the S-Pen and everything else for that matter. The processor is more than capable. The resolution is great! The 500T is the whole package!That being said, don't expect to take this machine out of the box and love it, or you will be VERY disappointing. If you have been waiting for a true desktop replacement in a tablet and have some patience and enthusiasm, this machine will be your go to advice as well, I can almost promise you that much. I would suggest keeping it plugged in all day and doing all the updates before even trying to use it, because you may find yourself mistaking it for defective or just crap if you don't.So there you have it. I had the 500T and the 700T in my hands for a weekend, my work said I could keep which ever I liked better and after a full weekend of throwing everything I could at both, I decided I would MUCH rather keep the 500T. As I said before, I cursed this machine out of the box, but now I wouldn't trade it for ANY computer, regardless of price!I will update this review if I have ANY problems in the future. If I help even one other person to get a tablet to once and for all replace their desktop or laptop without having to accept any significant compromise, the time it took to write this review was worth it! Samsung has caused some trouble and confusion releasing this machine before it was ready and supported with proper driver and software updates, but I can truly say, even being a anti Samsung consumer, that Samsung has hit a home run with this device in the end, perhaps in the 9th inning, but never the less, it's a win for Samsung and a win for me!I LOVE the 500T! I'm a computer expert and know what I'm talking about. For the purpose it was created to serve, it is hands down a wonderful, ground breaking, futuristic all in one solution to those looking for a FULL FEATURED TABLET! If you have a little patience, BUY THIS UNIT!*EDIT 1/18/2013 AFTER A WEEK OF USE AND THE MOST EFFORT I HAVE EVER PUT INTO MAKING (TRYING TO) A DEVICE WORK AS ADVERTISED*After a week of using this, though I will stick to saying that this has potential to be one of the greats, when it works right, it does occasionally (which is too often in my line of work) freeze up and or drop and forget the WIFI connection, which sometimes requires several restarts to fix. If you are working on something, that can be a pain, or in my line of work, mean your back-side. I don't know if this is still a driver/firmware/software issue(s) that can be fixed or if it is just first gen hardware reality. Also the micro HDMI output is just putting out less than the stated resolution to my external monitor; it's noticeably more grainy than my sister's ultra book with the same (stated) output.And as far as using it as a TABLET ONLY, and or as a SECOND or ADDITIONAL device, in which you have something else to use when you cannot accept the \"issues\" this one has, go for it! BUT, if you are wanting to use a (THIS) tablet as your MAIN computer and you are dependent on computing for work, even though I WISH this was up to that job, it just isn't, YET.

This is exactly what I have been looking for.  The freedom of having a tablet that can handle Windows applications, with a keyboard that protects the screen when closed.I installed Microsoft Office 2007 - Word and Excel run great.  I have not tried running Access or Outlook, but they are both installed, as well as OneNote.  I also installed Quicken 2012 Premier, which also runs perfectly - I use it daily.  Don't be concerned with the Atom processor speed if all you do is browse the internet, listen to music, watch movies, or run any of the programs I mention on this review.  I run Netflix on it and the movies come through with no issues.  The OS comes with SkyDrive installed, which I have used.  As of now, you can view what is in the SkyDrive from your iPhone, but you cannot edit it.Make sure that you download the S Camera app - it has better controls for the camera, and it has a control for the flash (which the Windows 8 camera software doesn't have).Wireless signal on the tablet is excellent.  I wish the resolution could be higher, but it is good enough for almost everything.The tablet has a USB port on the tablet itself, and two additional USB ports on the keyboard dock.  I have a Brother printer MFC-7840W that I wanted to print from.  I plugged it into the USB, and the machine recognized the printer, and installed it with no issues.You have to remember that this is a Windows PC, so you MUST get virus protection (I installed AVG free) and firewall (I installed TinyWall, which has some quirks with the Metro interface but manages to do great protecting the PC).  Within the first 3 hours I had it, it got a virus infection that I could not recover it from.  The OS would not start.Windows 8 has an option called refresh, which is what I used.  It did not take long for the PC to refresh and to be able to get it working again.Windows 8 has its quirks, but having the desktop with the ability to touch the screen is amazing.  I find myself trying to do it on my Windows 7 machine...This tablet starts pretty quickly - 10 seconds to boot up.  Battery life is amazing - I don't charge it every day.I will say that the only negative is related to the Windows 8 apps - Microsoft needs to get more partners/companies to release more apps.  There are not very many apps available when compared to iPad/Android.  I hope that with time the available apps increase, and the prices decrease.I guess if I had something negative to say, it would be 2 things: I am not used to the touchpad not having the left/right buttons, and the feel of it could be a lot better (but I really get by with just touching the screen), and sometimes, when I \"dock\" the tablet onto the keyboard, I'm not sure if it's clicked on or not.  I wish it gave a louder click, or that there was a visual way of telling that it's all the way in.  That way I could prevent the keyboard from accidentally falling to the floor when I grab the tablet by the top part like I often do.  It has not happened because I have been careful to ensure the tablet has clicked in all the way.It is a bit expensive for what you get (Atom processor), but the flexibility of just having the tablet without the dock is what does it for me.Hope this helps you in making a buying decision.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Meets expectations", "Author": "Hyoun Jung", "ReviewID": "R1X38Z0VVJ79QY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The product arrived on time and in good condition.I bought it used in very good condition from the amazon warehouse but it came with the original samsung box and user manuals with the screen film still on and no scratch or any sign of use.The tablet itself is slightly larger and heavier than i expected, being used to an ipad 2.Also the screen aspect ratio is a little awkward to use in portrait mode because it is so long.But this works to an advantage sometimes when in desktop mode as you can leave the onscreen keyboard on and still have enough room to do what you need to above the screen.The display is high quality with good enough dpi to not notice pixels in my usage scenario, which is mostly as a laptop with occasional tablet use.In fact, I found the elements in desktop mode to be too small on native resolution and found myself leaning to read clearly, so I had to increase the size of elements to 125% and chrome zoom settings to 125%.The windows settings allows for changing the size without affecting resolution, which is good.The speakers are mostly loud enough but on some videos it can be a little quiet and sometimes a little tinny.The S-pen works well on some apps, no additional drivers required but there is no eraser function which makes it difficult to annotate pdf files with windows 8 apps which don't provide many functions.I ordered a samsung tablet pen with eraser.The buttons around the edges are easy to find and press.The lock orientation button is very convenient.The keyboard dock is very good.It feels more like aluminum, even though it is also plastic.The keys are a very good size and have good feedback and travel.Typing on it is a joy, I am typing this review on it.The touchpad also works well with multitouch gestures without causing any problems but I had a few occasions where I missed the built-in right click zone and ended up left clicking, which can be slightly annoying.I would have like backlighting on the keyboard, as well as audio jack and HDMI jack so that when the tablet is docked i would not have to have any cables connected to the screen, but that is a minor complaint.The docking mechanism works well mostly, as long as when you dock it push it down firmly enough until you can hardly see the windows button.There were a few occasions when I ran into the problem of the tablet undocking without me pulling it out but a firm push down again usually resolved the issue.In other words, for me it is a non-issue.Performance wise, once you have installed the updates it boots very fast.I do appreciate that no bloatware was installed but I had the option to download some useful apps from the samsung sw update program, which is good because the storage is not plentiful.It has 51gb available, I assume the 13gb is used for a recovery partition.Of that 39gb or so is available to the user, which is not bad if you are careful to choose only the things you need.There is also the SD card slot if you want to expand.You can also use the usb ports to connect external storage.On daily usage, the system seems to struggle a little bit with desktop software, which was expected with an atom processor.Programs take long to load and sometimes become unresponsive.Even switching tabs in chrome have a slight delay.Also, watching youtube videos in the chrome browser is jerky.But when you switch to the modern UI it does much better.The apps take less storage than desktop programs in general and run much smoother.Youtube videos at 720p cause no problems in a dedicated youtube app.Battery life is solid.I usually unplug in the morning and leave it on all day and just let it sleep when I walk away.When I plug it in to charge at night it usually still has about 20%.It awakes instantly from sleep so even if you are away for a few minutes you can let it sleep by pushing the power button.If you need more energy savings you can shut down the system when you walk away and turn it back on when you get back and it will boot in about 10 seconds.No fans, no noise, but it does occasionally get warm around the front facing camera when running heavy tasks.Windows 8 is still a little bit confusing but all in all this product has been a joy to use and I recommend it highly if you know what to expect from an atom windows 8 tablet.", "Date": "July 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "solid value -  but sleep-mode-battery issue", "Author": "Machine Head", "ReviewID": "RQ93QEX44UYL8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Previous tablet experience:  2 years with a 1st-Gen Ipad and then a recent purchase of a Lenovo Thinkpad 2, which I returned to the seller because of a broken speaker as well as other dissatisfactions.  Laptop experience: a 2-year old Lenovo 14-inch Thinkpad and a Dell Latitude, both of which I am very satisfied with.  Skype experience: several laptops and an Iphone 4s.Overall assessment --  As a general-use tablet, it's still a good option at the price I paid ($500).  Everything but the 'sleep mode' works as it should and the tradeoff of the 'additional' weight (compared to a 10-inch tablet) for the bigger (11.5 inch) screen size and therefore bigger attached-keyboard, are well worth it.  It has the basic components for an in-between tablet and a laptop for business trips and daily tossing into the briefcase.  However, there are some areas in which the quality is less than desirable -- performance of the microphone on Skype calls (compared to my Iphone 4s), the mediocre responsiveness of the touchpad, and the non-functional 'sleep mode' (which drains the battery in 12 hours), make it a questionable purchase -- were it not for the digital pen -- but will you really use that?Likes:-  The 11.5 inch screen is definitely more 'comfortable' to read and edit work-documents and to write notes on, than a 10-inch screen.  Unlike other reviewers, I do not mind a larger, heavier tablet.  However, if I were seeking a pure-tablet experience, and did need a keyboard for constructing reports or complex emails, the lighter 10-inch tablets have an advantage for travel.-  The dockable keyboard --  The keyboard feels okay and my typing experience on it has been very good.  It provides an excellent combination with the tablet and really enhances the overall functionality in several ways -- It provides a ready, secure 'stand' for the tablet, and yet I can still pop the tablet out for those situations in which I want ONLY a tablet, and do not want a keyboard.-  Speakers -- MUCH better than the speakers on the TP2 (again, probably because the bigger device, at 11.5 inch, can carry bigger speakers).  I can actually listen to music on this device, without earbuds!- built-in video-cam and camera functions work fine.  Photos display fine.- digital pen:  Competing 'convertibles' either do not have a digital pen, or they have other quality issues.  If having a digital pen is a 'must' , then the Samsung Ativ 500T is still a good choice overall.Dislikes:1) Biggest issue is 'sleep mode' - it will drain the battery within a day (Lots of complaints about this on various websites).  Contacted a Samsung CSR and he was unable to offer a fix.  May be a bios problem.2) Touchpad on the attachable-keyboard is a little insensitive when dragging my finger along it to move the cursor on the screen - However, the touchpad is very responsive to a single tap of the fingertip and the buttons function about as well as I expected for a budget convertible. Touchpad 'buttons' (under the surface) require a 'firm click' - more pressure required than I would like.  But given that one always has the option of simply touching the screen, this isn't that much of an issue.3) Microphone seems to be poor -- after successive Skype calls, switching between an Apple Iphone 4s and the Ativ 500T made it apparent that the microphone in the Ativ 500T is a step down in quality.Typeface on the screen is grey,and never a true 'black' -- screen contrast isn't great,  but it is not a problem.  It is sufficient.  Photographs show up fine and video is okay too.There is some flex in the screen and a somewhat 'cheap' feel to the construction overall, but not so bad as to be an issue.

Purchased this back in November 2012 and six months in, I must say I am extremely pleased.  Others have written very good reviews here of the system specs, so I will not belabor the point.  As others have mentioned, an abundance of connection ports, SD micro expansion and good battery life make this an appealing tablet. FYI, the keyboard does NOT have an additional battery. I have personally gone about 2 days of general use (e-mail, web-browsing, media streaming, photo editing with Gimp) without charging or feeling the need to. If that doesn't fit your needs, you may want to look into something like the Hp Envy.  I've been vey pleased with Samsung products, so that was my attraction here.  I'm a bit disappointed with storage space. Coming from an iPad, 64 GB might sound like a lot, but once you really start using this thing setting up multiple user accounts, syncing with SkyDrive, etc. you will see what I mean.  Needless to say, I picked up a 64GB micro SD and 1TB external drive to supplement. As for Windows 8: Love it.  There is really no comparison for it out there right now.  You could try to look at it like an iPad, or Kindle Fire or any other Android device, but in my opinion nothing beats having an x86 processor in tablet form.  Being able to run my old version of Quickbooks is a plus, not to mention support for any printer with a windows print driver. Windows 8 actually makes for an excellent tablet experience.  With the keyboard dock, the tablet is a viable laptop replacement. Processor is snappy enough for most tasks except hard core gaming. I'm an old-school Starcraft guy, so saved an iso file, installed it and I'm good to go. I was an SNote user and it comes preinstalled on here, but after one day comparing it with the OneNote app I made the switch.  If you are a Windows user in the market for a new laptop but you are also looking for a tablet, I'd highly recommend this.  One thing to keep in mind: this is a full-blown computer, so watch what you install on here outside of the app store.  Windows Defender is a solid AV protection, but it's still very possible to really mess this thing up.

While the Atom processor has it's limits for functionality, I find that the Samsung Ativ has many basic uses. For one, it comes with a built-in stylus which is useful for storage. It stores right into the tablet portion of the device. The keyboard that attaches is useful but has functionality problems. As discussed in other posts, I have found I too have the same issue and can relate. The keyboard makes a noise when it detaches and attaches to the keyboard, thus, it is problematic in two ways. One, that it does not stay electronically attached, meaning that it doesn't work unless you have it on a plat, hard surface and pushed in securely. Two, that the annoyance from the keyboard loosely attaching could be a problem while in a meeting or in a quiet library or other environments where it would be unsuitable for a loud obnoxious tone. (you can turn this off, however, you will find that it is another annoyance when you are typing and unaware that the keyboard is not functioning.)Aside from the keyboard issue, there are other key factors one should be aware of when deciding to purchase. The first one being the processor. It is an Intel Atom Z2760 processor that I have in my model which is a 500T. It runs 32 bit Windows 8. The problems with this is that I am finding that it is somewhat slow for a tablet. I find it more user-friendly while accessing the internet or playing music. I would definitely not recommend running more than one application on it at a time.Nevertheless, it's sleek design and coloring choices are catchy and it has both a front and rear facing camera which is also convenient. The keys on the keyboard are also low-profile and when they are working, they are rather delightful to type with. As for the functionality overall, I would recommend light to medium workload that this tablet can handle. The pricepoint is a little spendy though for the functionality though. I recently bought my husband a Microsoft Surface that was about 300 dollars more and this is no match for it. The Surface can run games such as Tortchlight, Skyrim, and Diablo 3. This tablet cannot. There is also a difference in the edition of Windows though as the Suface was the Pro edition. The Windows version is supposed to be a full on version of Windows 8 but it seems to be lacking functionality of a true Windows 8 OS and by what I mean is that a few web pages and applications for some reason state they cannot be opened that can be opened on the Microsoft Surface.However, this tablet does nicely for someone in school as it is able to pull up Office and a full browser. I also think it is great that it is also a touch screen but for the price and functionality I was looking for, I opted to buy the Surface Pro as it ran programs that I needed to be able to run. My 3 out of 5 stars would be a 4 if the product had a bit more RAM to run things a bit faster. Overall, for the average user I would definitely recommend this device. If your looking for more functionality and processing power then go for a Surface Pro. Not the RT version of the Surface which is a whole different story. The Ativ is better overall in my opinion better than RT version of Windows on the cheaper Surface model.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2D9BNDFEH3EHE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Really fantastic for taking notes with digitizer pen in conjunction with Microsoft OneNote application.Also great to use on the treadmill for watching sites that require full Windows browser functionality/Flash.Very lightweight.Functions well without a keyboard, though I would recommend getting a Microsoft Wedge Mobile Keyboard.Easy to add a 64GB MicroSDXC card to expand storage capacity.Cons:Some programs that run off desktop are very slow, e.g. Quicken, and sometimes the Wifi connection lags, or is slow to boot up the mail program (and also doesn't always sync mail accounts) and Explorer browser.I still prefer using the iPad for some tablet functions like checking email and posting blogs.", "Date": "March 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Finally, a tablet that works as a productivity tool", "Author": "ask_away \"ask_away\"", "ReviewID": "RHP1RCXN5JZCD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I never bought a tablet before this one because they're not a productivity tool. I don't like carrying a tablet and a laptop so I bought an ultrabook. One year later, my husband's laptop needed to be replaced. In search of a new one, we saw this one. So I gave him my laptop and bought this one for myself. I bought it in Dec. 2012.Here's what I use it for: MS Office programs, browsing the Internet, and taking notes. I take a lot of notes for work and it was getting impossible to organize them so I wanted a digital solution for it going forward.I love the way I can use OneNote for taking notes - my co-workers are totally impressed. It is easy to organize my notes and go back and forth several pages, notebooks or sections. I don't regret buying it, I really love it.With that said, it has it glitches. The on-screen keyboard worked like a charm, auto-launching when you click on a text field. When Windows did the first batch of updates, the OSK wouldn't pop up automatically anymore, which is really annoying because you have to click on it on the tray. A coworker of mine had the same problem. I looked online for a fix but couldn't find any.Another peeve with this machine is that sometimes, when it has been on standby mode for a while, it won't recognize the pen anymore so I would have to reboot.The charger doesn't connect good so I have to put some weight where the connector is so it would charge, otherwise, it won't.I didn't have any problem with the keyboard like others did, but I find it too bad that it doesn't have extra battery to extend the tablet life. For 10 hours battery life, I can't really complain. For just taking notes and surfing the Internet for 3-4 hours a day, I would only have to charge it once or twice a week.I don't use the keyboard much but it is very handy for when I have to type a document. The quality of the keyboard is not very good. It feels very plasticky.UPDATE 8/13/2013Eight months of using this, I am still very happy with it. The problem with the charger connector has disappeared. The keyboard does tend to disconnect when you move -- like putting it down or picking it up.

The new unit showed up from Amazon with the keyboard dock which is a nice addition for writing emails in bed and when no table surface is available you can type with it in you lap.  Unfortunately there is a defect in the bezel of the new tablet. Near the SD slot the bezel is bulging outward.Pros:Very capable processorRuns most Win8 Compatible appsgood size for apps that require screen real estateSPen (love it)Keyboard dock (for typing from your lap)Built in peripheralsBright screenBattery life very goodSamsung updating drivers regularlyCons:Weight (Esp with KBD dock)Build Quality QCScreen DPI (should be higher)Lack of working NFC (As far as I know only LTE version has proper antenna)Soft keyboard wonky (no swipe / voice input)Slippery exteriorBloatwareWin 8 (Should still be in Beta)Lack of accessories (Temporary)Not sure what color the case really isAll in all I have high hopes for this device, I just hope I can get one that is more reliable.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, but unreliable keyboard dock.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1W9DRFRJ7I5PL", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Ativ 500t tablet had everything I wanted in a tablet (i.e. stylus, nice multi-touch screen, convertible dock, thin tablet, full Windows 8), but the keyboard dock was almost unusable.

Read the reviews carefully.  If you can deal with the issues and get this tablet at a good price, I think you will be happy with it.Update: As of this date (June 18, 2013) the 500T is #31 on the top 100 best selling \"laptops\" list and has been in the Amazon top 100 sales ranks for 244 days running.  That surprised me quite a bit.  So it seems there are quite a few who like this rig!Summary:  Purely as a \"tablet\" experience, my Android tablets are far superior.  However, it runs Win 8 which is a huge plus if you need that capability and opens a lot of new doors.  So, it is a definite trade-off and one should consider carefully.  Given the price, a small Ultrabook is a reasonable alternative, in my opinion, when you have the keyboard attached.  However, without the keyboard, then a direct tablet vs. tablet comparison is the better \"apples to apples\" view.  So already you can see both the dichotomy and the attraction.  What is \"desktop mode\" without the trackpad (or mouse) and keyboard?  A mess!  So the dock is essential in desktop mode (for me, anyway).  And then, in tablet mode, one compares this to a good Android tablet and the Android wins (in my opinion) overall as a much better experience.  So what you are paying for here is a device that can live in both worlds... sort of a \"jack of all trades and master of none\" situation.  The ultrabook wins hands down for desktop uses and Android (or ipad) wins as a tablet...but the 500T wins when you need (or want) both in one slim, portable device.  And the 500T is not without it's charms (great screen, long battery life, etc.).So, as a device that can serve as a tablet one day, and then act like a mini-netbook-ultrabook (with keyboard dock) the next, well, there you have something - if you need it.  If you do, then the price may be justified and there are some nice features along with the many glitches.  If you accept the quest and vanquish the endless updates, you may find the treasure you seek.In the end, I am satisfied with it for the price I paid, but I almost sent it back.  Only by going through several days of updates (endless, slow updates!) and tweaks was I able to \"tame\" this to something I could live with.  I am definitely not sure the average consumer should subject themselves to that experience, so I would say this device is best for a gearhead geek like me rather than the average user.  Still I note in the reviews that several average users seem satisfied, so what do I know?  ;)Now that it has settled down, the wars are over, and it is behaving as it should, I am beginning to enjoy it more and more.  My favorite thing about this device is the very nice screen which makes watching videos a great experience (using headphones or external speakers).  Graphic images and photos look superb as well.  Also, it is a slim, trim and very portable device.  The final jewel that won me over was the excellent battery life.  Getting 10-14 hours of real life use on battery is absolutely wonderful and a real treat.  (If you actively manage power use, you can extend battery life even longer.  If you are lazy and never worry about it, you will still get 8-10 hours easily.)  That is a game changer for me and maybe you as well.Initially, during my first 2-3 days of ownership, I would have rated this 1 or 2 stars, maybe 3 tops.  But now that things have settled down, I would give it 3 at full price and 4 stars if you can get it at a good price.  Value matters.  If I pay more, I expect more.  So please keep that in mind. Thus my final, somewhat generous, rating is 4 stars, overall, and based on my personal experience, price paid (low), and needs.  (Screen quality, battery life, and the ability to run windows software are the big factors in the final rating.)Pros:  Runs Windows 8 so you can run legacy and most recent Windows software.  Very nice, slim profile for a large tablet.  Very portable.  Boots up fast.  Includes built-in digitizer and S-Pen interface (Pen stores on back of tablet.)  No fan and no heat!  Keyboard dock when it works (It will eventually settle down - hang in there!  See comments below.)  Long battery life!!!  Beautiful large display -- sweet!Cons:  Runs Windows 8 -- not really \"tablet/desktop combined\" ready -- lots of glitches, Windows 8.1 on the way will fix some of these issues (hopefully!).  Bluetooth is broken.  None of my Bluetooth devices tried so far will work properly.  Can pair, but not connect.  Have tried many things, but nothing works (so far). [Confirmed many others having same issue, broken BT software.  This is a big minus for me, might not be for others.]  Keyboard dock when it doesn't work.  (See below.  Can be fixed with time and effort.)  Limited (2) screen resolution choices available (affects games mostly).  Glitchy operation.  For example, using headphones/external speakers sometimes it gets confused as to whether the internal speakers or external are \"active.\"  Easily fixed, but annoying.Here are my thoughts, notes and comments from my use so far:On sleep, turns off music.  Android tablets are smart enough to continue playing your tunes even when sleeping.  However, this is normal for Windows 8.Endless updates!!!  For the first several days be prepared for literally hours and hours of time updating your tablet.Flakiness in general - settles down some after updates, but still glitchy in many areas.Power button - position and short press on/off means *very* easy to accidentally turn on tablet when carrying it around. Would be better to have press and hold or slide like most tablets.  (Did they actually use test this thing?)  Volume control on side works well.Speakers not working when turned off with Audio out plugged in and then removed and restart system -- even after two restarts.  Had to plug speaker in, turn off, remove, and then it worked again - dumb!ETD.sys BSOD error - keyboard touch pad driver related, I believe.  (This was eventually resolved with further updates.)Keyboard working better finally but still an occasional disconnect/reconnect.  However, after many days and using the tip from another review here to put something behind the screen to push it forward, it mostly works fine now (even without anything behind it).  My experience seems to confirm other review comments that it eventually settles down with a little wear and use.Keyboard is fairly nice when it works.  USB ports are good, but a shame no audio/video ports on the dock.The S-Pen and built-in digitizer work well.  For some this will be a very big deal, not so much for others.  For me it is a very nice plus and a bonus over many similar tablet devices.  You can write and draw -- the most natural thing in the word to want to do on a tablet.  Nice!Windows 8 sucks as a Hybrid OS -- It should have kept the Desktop and Tablet modes more separate.  Tablet features interfere with desktop mode operation and make things harder.  Desktop mode is fairly useless without the keyboard dock or an external mouse and keyboard of some kind.  Maybe 8.1 will improve this.Beautiful screen, rich colors and good color saturation, good contrast, good viewing angles -- excellent for movies and video, photos, etc..  One of the best things about this device.Ability to run standard windows software is, of course, wonderful and the big draw here.Performance is OK, fine for most things.  Some lags here and there, programs slow to start, but operate fine.  Occasionally, something takes a bit longer than expected and you must be patient.  In normal operation it is responsive and fine.Internal storage is slow, the Samsung Micro-SD card (64 GB Class 10) I installed in the Micro-SD slot seems faster than the internal storage.  Hopefully, the internal storage is very reliable. Adding a Micro-SD card is absolutely essential.  Plan for it and include the cost.  It helps a great deal and you will need the additional storage as only about 39 GB is free on the internal.Android tablets a much, much better out of box experience.  (I'm just saying...)Some older games run fine, some not, hit or miss, just have to try, but being able to run some older, legacy games is a nice treat.  For example, \"Panzer General 3D\" loaded and runs, but slow between turns as it \"thinks\" -- animations and play is OK. Slow saves and other admin stuff. Playable if you're patient, but might get iffy with larger campaigns.  Have not tested that yet, just a quick scenario.  And due to the screen resolution limitations, it is a bit small, does not use the full screen.  On the other hand, \"Avadon - The Black Fortress\" runs fine, looks great, and uses most of the screen.  Planescape Torment also runs fine, but is small on screen like PG 3D as it uses a 640x480 portion of the screen only.  Looks good, though.As a tablet, it is sleek, has a great screen, works well for most things.  A bit big and awkward compared to smaller tablets, but you get that great video/movie screen! Overall it's not a big issue.  I got a small tablet stand for watching movies (without the keyboard dock attached) and it works great.  Can also watch holding/resting in lap.  No fan and no heat is a big plus.Battery life is fantastic - wonderful -- and a huge plus.  This was the thing that closed the deal for me.Speakers sound pretty good for a tablet, not very loud, though.  Ok for some things.  Need headphones or external speakers for music and videos in my opinion.Bluetooth is an ungodly mess.  Most of my devices would not work.  Would pair, but not connect.  Think it is installing wrong drivers (incorrectly identifying the devices) not sure.  Win 8 seems to have lots of Bluetooth issues.  Also very clumsy to add devices and use them -- far worse than Win 7.  How disappointing! Bluetooth should be easy to use, not the freaking nightmare it is here.  A quick Google search will show many are having issues and feel the same.  However, Win 8 BT on my Win 8 laptops works fine, so may be due to Samsung's choice of BT software.  Others are reporting similar issues.  Some rolled backed to earlier version of BT software and fixed it, others hoping for an update that will fix.  I gave up for the time being.  Will tackle it later when and if I have time.  But a real negative for me as I use BT speakers a lot.Tablet and keyboard look great and it has a very \"netbook\" feel in use, but with decent performance.  Perfectly fine from physical use point of view.  Web browsing and most apps run fine.  Performance is surprisingly good at times.The built-in digitizer and S-pen have a lot of potential that I have not even begun to explore yet.  Using the note apps, it works fine and is fun to use.  Later I will load some photo editing and graphics software and see what else is possible.  It's a substantial advantage over other comparable tablets if you need it and a nice plus even if you do not.Battery lasted 16-18 hours with intermittent use, sometimes heavy, sometimes light, sometimes idle.  Battery life is *not* an issue.  About 3% drain overnight which seems reasonable. I am getting 10-14 hours with constant use routinely.  With light use, I have gone days without recharging.USB flash drives w/kybd dock worked great - recognized and available very quickly.Win 8 Experience Ratings:Processor..... 3.4  (Acceptable.  Occasional lags on intensive programs.)Memory........ 4.6  (Fine.)Desktop Gfx... 3.7  (Acceptable.  Never notice any lag at desktop or start screen)Gaming Gfx.... 3.2  (Oops!  Not much for 3D Gaming...some old games will run OK, hit or miss)Primary HDD... 5.8  (Slow! You can see why programs load slowly, most 5400 HDD's are faster.)These scores are definitely in the \"netbook\" category, but for a tablet, they are actually fairly good.  The proper comparison here is to other tablets, not to laptops/notebooks (IMHO).  In use, things normally feel fine.  There are the occasional lags, especially with some system tasks, but most apps and programs run fine.  I had an Acer netbook and this is a much better experience.One could argue that buying an Ultrabook and an Android tablet would be a better way to go.  Depends on your needs and how many devices you want to lug around.  For many, the 500T (or similar) will be a very reasonable compromise.", "Date": "June 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Wonderful tablet, horrible keyboard dock", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3EGQ9BPA7GLD9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a 30s web designer and computer consultant.  This was a fun splurge for me.  When I got it two days ago I was super excited.  I did everything the previous reviews said to do re updates, and fiddling with the keyboard.  The tablet is wonderful.  So here's the good stuff:Its super light, the display rocks, metro is actually usable and fast, pen is a great plus, downloaded OneNote and its great.  Battery lasts forever.So here's the bad.  First, the simple stuff.  Bloatware.  That was removed first, and for 700 bucks, they could have left it out.  But no biggy.  Then the auto dim sensor.  It sucks.  Turned it off. Now I have to manually adjust brightness.  Battery will probably suffer.  So they must have done all this testing.  Why did they not fix it?  Or did they just not care?  And software.  There is nothing on this but windows 8.  Don't expect nice stuff.  Its actually a great os but its an empty shell.  Bummer.The big bad stuff now.  The keyboard.  I paid about 100 bucks extra for that.  And it sucks.  The tab goes in fine.  The tab comes out fine.  I press really hard, and make sure to push to the right when its down.  Still, as you type, it stops working.  As you scroll and move the trackpad, it stops working.  Lots of nice sounding windows disconnect sounds, then connect sounds.  Imagine this happening every few minutes.  Just enough for you to initially think, ok, fluke, then after two days your done.So, this morning I text chat with Samsung support.  Wow.  Major bummer.  I'm pretty sure I was on with the guy that does the frig support.  Serious.  That's one of the drop downs when you start the chat!  And he took half an hour to say send it back.  So you would think ok, I'll send the keyboard back.  I just spent 700 and so I'll keep using the tablet without the keyboard for a week or two or three and then all will be well.  But no.  Everything must be returned.  Stupid.  Why?  From the comments on these reviews, you would think they would be smart enough to at least get some better support and admit keyboard faulty, so just send it back.  But no.  They don't care about your inconvenience.  So I'm probably going to send this back.  Major bummer.It just sucks that the tablet is so nice and cool.

However, I have found ways to fix and work around every single problem I have come across. I will list them along with corresponding fixes as follows:1. The FIRST thing you should do is use the Samsung update software, followed by Windows Update to correct many issues before you come across any more.2. Even after the updates the network adapter would not detect or auto connect to my network that has a hidden SSID, but it would detect all other networks. This one took me a while because I could not find the name of the network adapter. You will need to update the driver of the network adapter with one that was intended for a Lenovo tablet that uses the same adapter, but it should fix any network issues you are facing like it did for me. Google search (Broadcom BCMSDH43XX driver update) and download driver number: (5.93.97.83). After download it is very user friendly and installs itself.3. For some strange reason, Windows Media Player will not allow you to use media files that are on a removable drive (eg. SD card, USB drive). This was very frustrating and had a very easy fix that was even more frustrating, because I spent so much time trying to figure out a solution with such a simple fix. All you have to do is place a shortcut from the media files or folder into the music library in your documents. From then on Windows Media Player will recognize and sync your files that are on your removable storage drive.4. I have grown very accustomed to the Start button and menu on previous versions of Windows, and I found a solution to the problem. Iobit.com has a free program that adds a start button and menu to your taskbar in Windows 8. You can right click the button to change the settings as you please. Iobit.com has other useful free programs as well.5. This one I have read many times on many forums, and I am embarrassed for those who could not figure it out before they reviewed this machine. You have to push the tablet ALL the way into the keyboard dock so that it CLICKS into place. One time I had the issue of the keyboard connecting and disconnecting before I just pushed it on a little more and it clicked with no following issues.That is all I can think of for now, but if you have any more issues or questions I may or may not be able to help you. My email address is Mannyjv@varelanet.comNow as for my rating... I rate this a 4 just because of how long it took me to resolve the aforementioned issues.

The second computer to do that on me in the last five years. In all honesty I was planning to get the Samsung Chromebook but Best Buy was all out. So I visited the Staples next door. They had it, but they also had this computer. I didn't even know it was a tablet at first since it was set up like a laptop. Better it was at a very reduced price, $400 with the keyboard which was close enough to the Chromebook for me to consider it. And since I'm typing this review on it I obviously went with it.What sold me initally was I had 14 days to return it if I wasn't happy. It had a 64 Gig SD Hard drive compared to the 16 on the Chromebook. I was not familiar with Windows 8 at all and was completely confused by it initially. But I'd read up on it and the potential power of the OS which impressed me. At first I hated it and considered returning the tablet but kept at it. Now a month later I am very sold on it. While Windows 8 is a big change it is much more tablet app like than Windows 7 could be. I don't see it as ideal on a computer without touch screen but that isn't something I have to worry about with this computer.I've had no issues with drivers, lap, slow down, or programs. I mostly use my computer for media, writing and internet. Being compatible with the Office Suite wasn't something on my 'must have' list but it does make my life a bit easier. The S pen is very neat and I'm learning how useful it can be. I can take notes, draw on slides, etc much faster than I could using keyboard and mouse. The apps I've downloaded have worked flawlessly for me. I accepted that I needed a good antivirus with Windows 8 I wouldn't have needed with the Chrome OS, but the pros outweigh that con. I also travel a fair bit and this may be the lightest, easiest to carry 'laptop' I've ever owned.All that said I do no think this is an amazing tablet. Compared to the Ipad and Nexus I have I find it somewhat heavy and a little oversized. But as a hybrid that can serve as both a tablet and laptop for me I think its fantastic. For the price they can currently be found at I think its hard to beat and well worth a look, even as a laptop replacement if you don't need tons of onboard storage.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This unit is fast", "Author": "S.

Hellkamp", "ReviewID": "R2CYX639EEM7XJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this for about six months and overall I  am pleased. I travel and wanted something more mobile than a laptop, but it still had to be able to run some actual programs, especially Quicken. I like to keep up with the news and needs something that surfed the internet news sources, but had a offline reading capability when networks were unavailable. I also wanted some ability to play downloaded movies, music or streaming video for the times I am on a plane or stuck in a hotel with nothing to do. I bought this without a keyboard dock because I wanted the portability of a reader. The desktop keyboard is adequate. I was able to use it to do this rating, but not adequate if you plan on writing a novel.Here are some pros and cons:What I like:1. This is more than just a tablet. It is also a computer that you can load old windows programs on. So I can load my Quicken and use it.2. It is also a Reader. I can get my Time and other magazines and read them. It displays magazines beautifully and the magazines have online content not available in the print edition. The Microsoft Bing news app displays multiple news articles from various sources, primarily the NYT, Washington Post, Bloomberg and many others. Most of these are available for offline viewing or can be saved for reading later. Although, sometimes they are not saved to the computer and ask for you to get back online.3. It hooks up to wireless networks quickly and is stable. Opening the cover takes it out of a sort of sleep mode and it hooks back up to the network smoothly.4. Battery life is excellent compared to a conventional laptop. I'm not on it all day, but they advertise about 9 hours of battery life and that sounds about right.5. Since it is a regular windows computer, it hooks up to my home computer network and I can share files, view video and pictures, and use the network printer.5. The 11.6 size is a nice fit, especially when viewing. Gives you more space especially when you are using it to multitask - an improved feature in window 8.1.6. You can add more memory. $50 got me an additional 64 gb micro sd card.7. Comes with an adequate email app that links easily to most emails clients. Probably inadequate if you are a heavy business email user.What I don't like, but live with.1. Although it works as a computer, running processor hungry programs like Quicken slow it way down. Not a deal breaker but it could use a faster processor.2. Video quality is good and streaming quality, as expected, depends upon the incoming signal. But, the display is still below the quality of the IPad or the Galaxy 10.1 tablet, close but not quite.3. As usual, with a computer, goofy things just happen. Samsung is trying to push a GPS update to me and it wont load because I don't think there is a GPS in the unit. But it keeps trying. Also, sometimes apps freeze and have to be restarted - both in windows and the metro desktop. Anybody that has a computer knows this is nothing new.4. The operating system eats up at least half of the 64 gb internal memory.5. The computer knows that extra memory has been added in the sd card, but most of the apps, especially the Samsung and Microsoft ones, can't see the sd card. That means if you have music on both the card and internal memory, the music player only sees one source not both. Not a problem on my android phone, but Microsoft hasn't figured it out.6. Saving articles for offline viewing is frustrating. So far not a lot of apps do it and the ones that do usually drop the photos or are inconsistent in what is saved. The Bing news reader is pretty good along with USA Today but it is hard to find others that don't cost money.That's all I can come up with. Hope it helps.

In windows site they even say that if u buy from Microsoft, it comes clean with no bloatware!! so that means they are aware!! my assumption is that these bloatwares were installed on these early releases inorder to collect system failure reports secretly!! so that they can work on it.so in the middle of watching a movie, you can still get pretty annoyed by the frequent disconnect sounds! other than that the apps are in an embryonic stage. not many apps.An important thing----- if u cant update using sw software, go directly to Samsung website and download everything through browser and install!! bcoz sw program itself is buggy and super slow.

I work five days a week and attend an online school at the same time. I have a 17 inch laptop which is big and heavy to haul around. I commute using mass transit every single day. I was looking for 10 to 12 inch tablet that is portable enough to bring everywhere. I looked at various tablets in the market such as the Ipad, Android tablets, and the new Window 8 slates. From what I browsed through, I narrowed my options down to 2: Galaxy Note 10.1 and Samsung Ativ Smart PC with keyboard. Both of them have a stylus which I like a lot. I've been a fan of the stylus since my Palm pilot days. Wacom stylus with Samsung integration takes it to a whole new level. Both of them have Allshare Play which makes presentations easy and seamless. Each of them has different OS. I'm very accustomed to either one. I've been an android user since the first google phone. Windows has been my PC OS of choice since Windows 95. My decision to purchase this one is based on 3 premises (1) Keyboard, (2)Desktop mode, (3)MS Office. I've been looking at various keyboards for the galaxy note 10.1. All of them are too small for my hands. Most of the keyboards also come with a leather cases. Theses cases are too flimsy to use as laptop stand while commuting to and from work everyday. The keyboard makes it easier for me to type with all ten fingers as opposed to a four to six finger typing using the smaller Note 10.1 keyboards. As much as I enjoy the Android UI and Metro UI, I am quite attached to the windows desktop mode. I like the simplicity of a windows desktop. Polaris, Quickoffice, Officesuite, and Kingsoft are all decent alternatives to the real MS Office. However, none of them are capable of a full MS office suite which includes, access, publisher, outlook, and onenote.Here is a list of CONs which I don't count against it but some people might: (1) camera quality is subpar (Note 10.1 beats it, no questions asked); (2) app store is lacking (not as extensive as Itunes or Play Store but it will get there eventually); (3) system gets sluggish when handling intense software/games (definitely no games like oblivion). (4) Screen easily attracts plenty of smudges especially if you have oily hands. (5) S-pen can be a pain in the neck to unmount with or without the keyboard (6) touchpad on the keyboard can be ultra sensitive at times.Update (1/11/13)After a couple of months of use, I still am looking forward to using this device as my portable computer. I use it to go online and type classroom discussions and required research work while sitting in the bus or train. The multi-window capability of the Metro UI is quite handy in multi-tasking i.e. watching a video while taking notes at the same time. The battery life is quite amazing in comparison to Ipads and Android tablets.  As a matter of fact, I only charge it once every three to four days. Also, Samsung does a good job of updating this device on a regular basis. The Wacom stylus is very intuitive. I just wished there are more apps that uses its 1024 level of pressure sensitivity.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "great idea, not great support from samsung", "Author": "Tommy Martin", "ReviewID": "R108FL07YNBZY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Overall it is a great product, but not without it's issues. It is able to do an impressive amount of things without compromising portability.Background on me: College student, pretty tech savvy. I'm no software coder or anything but I know my way around computers.Screen: Great, very bright, good colors, responsive, occasional driver issues (more on that later).Build quality: Typical Samsung design, completely plastic but still feels solid. Nothing to write home about but works fine.Keyboard: Fantastic, best tablet keyboard I have ever used. Full sized, feels great to type on. Sometimes issues with connection though as others have pointed out. I had to turn off the noise for connecting and disconnecting because it got quite annoying. Once the sound is off it works great.Software: Windows 8 is great. Definitely optimized for touchscreens and the metro interface is beautiful and responsive. 8.1 adds some new features that makes it feel like a more polished OS. Love having access to full desktop applications, but not all of them work great. Have had some issues with drivers. The graphics driver occasionally messes up and resets the resolution to a low res square. All you have to do to fix that is right click on the desktop and go to graphics settings and change the resolution. The wifi is also a little hit and miss as other reviewers have pointed out. Restarting fixes that issue.Performance: The atom processor is decent. There are some newer tablets with newer atom processors that should be a lot better, but none include the pen (at least so far). Anyway, the performance in metro apps and light programs is great, but gaming performance is straight up bad. I have yet to find a desktop game that I can play. I can't even play 7 year old games like Star Wars Battlefront or Republic Commando. It can only squeeze out 2-3 fps on Age of Empires. In short, if you want to play games other than angry birds or fruit ninja, this is NOT the tablet for you. fortunately for me, I did not by it for games, I bought it for school. For web browsing and document editing it is fantastic.Battery life: I haven't done any specific tests to figure out how long it will last, but it has pretty impressive battery life. I use this for all my note taking at school and it will last through 5-6 hours of solid use such as note taking, document editing, and occasionally the light game of angry birds or solitaire. If I am using it all day I will need to top it off halfway through the day, but for light usage it easily lasts a whole day.Pen: Definitely the best part about this tablet. This is what sets it apart from other tablets and the reason why I bought this tablet. Other than the Thinkpad Tablet 2, there are no real competitors in this price range that include the digitizer. Microsoft OneNote is brilliant for note taking. Even if you don't have full office there is an app in the store that is almost as good. It has full pen support and syncs automatically to the cloud. The pen works great for note taking, drawing, and clicking on the desktop when you need something more precise than your finger. Definitely worth your money if you want to take notes with it.Competition: If you really want the pen (which I heavily recommend), the only main options are the Lenovo Thinkpad Tablet 2 or the Surface Pro 1 or 2. Both of these are more expensive. The Lenovo would probably be better in build quality and perhaps software, but it has the same processor and the keyboard isn't as good. The Surface Pro has a much better processor, but is significantly more expensive and doesn't have good battery life. If you don't want the digitizer there are many tablets with better processors and/or lower prices, so if the digitizer isn't necessary there are probably better options.Overall: Fantastic if you want it for productive things. It is passable for music and video, horrible for gaming, but amazing for document editing and note taking. If you want an entertainment device, go for Android (or Apple if you have loads of money to waste), but this is a great option for students who want the digitizer pen.UPDATE:After using the tablet for a long time I am more convinced than ever that it is a great device for note taking students who only need to run light programs. Unfortunetely, the tablet has gradually become more and more unusable. This is due largely to a lack of driver updates from Samsung. Microsoft frequently pushes updates for windows, but the Samsung specific driver updates are few and far between. Often when the updates come out they do not even fix the problems. I have noticed that the more Windows advances and updates the more buggy and unusable the tablet becomes. This is not Microsofts fault, it is Samsungs problem. For example, when I first bought the tablet I did not experience any issues with the screen whatsoever. However, I have recently had issues with images burning into the edges of the screen if I stay on one image to long, thus whenever I change programs I can still see the edges of the previous one. Not only that, I frequently have to reboot when using the digitizer and touch at the same time because the touch screen becomes highly random in it's sensitivity and accuracy. I have also experienced more issues with wifi in the past few weeks. I had to take the original rating of 4 stars down to 2 for these reasons. At it's best the tablet is absolutely a 4 star product, but if Samsung isn't willing to continue with driver updates then it is not worth the money or frustration. It is a shame to see such a good device, as well as the $550 I paid, go to waste.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good tablet/PC", "Author": "M.

Also tiny menu when using Photoshop CS5 was irritating - not sure how MacPro retina display handles Photoshop menu....I also have Samsung Note 10.1 and will compare them.Pros:1. Price.  I paid 1/3 of what I paid for Surface pro 128.2. Built in Wacom pen (S-Pen) with pressure sensitivity.  One of the reason why I have all these stylus enabled tablet - Photoshop and Sketch pro.3. 11 inch wide screen.  The extra one inch makes huge difference.  The screen is not crispy as Surface pro, but no issue watching movies.  Viewing angle is excellent (not sure if this is IPS screen).  11 inch means more estate to work on Photoshop and holding the tablet to read Kindle books make me feel like I'm Moses holding the 10 commandments tablet.4. Light and thin.  People complains about plastic and looking cheap.  To me, I rather have lighter tablet than heavy one.  I like Surface Pro's solid feel, but it's really hard to hold them up while you lie down - excellent for lazy like me.  This one feels about 1/2 the weight and 1/2 the thickness.4. Rotation lock button - this is the button every tablet should have.6. Runs cool.  Surface pro runs warm to touch after 5 minutes of usage.  this one never get even warm.7. Runs full version of Photoshop CS5 and other Windows app, including MS Office.  Photoshop touch was o.k. on Note 10.1, but no comparison to full version of CS5.8. Samsung app - The Mini S Note is very good.  Even if I have Office note, I use mini s-note.  However, I found Android version on Galaxy Note 10.1 has much more feature.9. Battery life seems pretty good.  I didn't test fully, though.10. No HDML double needed!!!  I spent extra for Surface Pro and Note 10.1 to buy a dongle.  Ativ500T has built in HDMI out port.11. Good sound - unlike other laptop (compare to my very old Lenovo X60 or even Surface pro), it has good sound.11. Windows8 OS.12. Galaxy Note 10.1's are more entertaining (more small games, Remote control with TV guide app, etc.,) but Windows 8 give you a bit of Android like app usage and full Windows OS environment.  I have not played any 3D games on this yet.  Maybe try Farcry3 or Skryrim later.13. Option to have a keyboard doc that works really like a laptop.  MS Surface pro's cover type keyboard are good, but it's really cumbersome and awkward to use on one's lap.  Also cover type mouse pad is very hard to use because of it's small size.Cons1. Power adapter connector is horrible.  Sometimes I had to push and hold it for it to charge.  Ridiculous.2. Made in China.  Again, adapter port and headset port are very bad. Probably using cheap made in China part.  Samsung should keep the factory in Korea.3. Slower boot up time than Surface pro, but way faster than any standard laptop - compared to my work laptop, Lenovo T430.4. Slower speed, when multitasking.  Sometimes, it got to a point where touch response is not responding for about a second or two.5. Small space.  64GB version has about half taken away by Win8 OS, leaving you wiht some 27GB space.  Must to have microSD if you are listening to mp3 collection or watching movie collection.  I purchased 64GB Samsung microSD Pro when I purchase this tablet (under $50) and setup my outlook PST file to the microSD card.5. Bloatware. I uninstalled Norton, Photoshop element, and MS office 2010 (which requires key that's different than my version).

Its not a bad device if you want to simply have a reader and play simple games.  Minimal note taking in meetings, watching video, web browsing, email, etc.  I also have an hp touchpad (really liked webs), and a decent android tablet (not low end) which can do the same things as the iPad.  But if you want to do work on the go, those devices are crap.  Yeah I have pages, numbers and keynote, but they are weak.  Honestly, those android, and ios devices are for sheep, for people who want to consume rather than create (garageband is the exception).Regardless, my use of the iPad had been diminishing because I could not do my work with it.  However, my purchase of this device has made me completely abandon the iPad and android (its job is a control for my htpc now).  In fact, I could not even remember where my iPad was last week.The ativ 500t is light weight with a great screen.  It runs windows 8 which works smoothly.  It runs Microsoft office (2013 is better but 2010 works fine), it runs open office.  It runs dia.  Email is just fine - I don't know why people complain.  It runs pretty fast and has 2-3 days battery life with pretty heavy usage.  It has run every one of my desktop apps that I want on this device.My favorite aspect is that I have a real file system unlike ios.  I can copy stuff to usb key, I can have programs share documents and data without some stupid go between like email or cloud as in ios.  And skydrive is phenomenal!  It makes icloud look like a joke.The Wacom technology is wonderful if you want to do some sort of computer painting (you can find a copy of creaturehouse expression 3 which is old, but free from Microsoft) and have pressure sensitive brushes.  It is also much more accurate than the finger.I can also use this tablet on that pos software used in many schools: blackboard.  Try doing that on an iPad - I have and the iPad experience makes blackboard horrific!But you have to remember that this is a system that trades battery life for processor.  It is NOT for playing graphic intensive games.  Its a netbook in a different form factor.One thing I have noticed is that the os and drivers are undergoing changes.  There are some bugs that are a little annoying, but not horrible.  The only bug I really see is that the device sometimes does not wake immediately from sleep when shut down with a magnetic case.  But that's not too bad since it does happen irregularly and I'm sure it will be solved soon.Regardless, I find the tablet experience on this device to be exactly what I want.  I can do work on the device.  I can browse the internet.  I can deal with email.  I can draw.  I can create and edit documents correctly.  It is what I thought tablets should be: a useful tool.  Not a device for consuming media.

When the expected ship date came and I got an email saying it was delayed, I ended up buying the tablet from a box store and the keyboard a month later from the same box store.Conceptually this tablet is great. A tablet for tablet things, and a keyboard for keyboard things. If you're a hardcore user you can run Quickbooks, Visual Studio, SQL Server, etc. then this could have been a perfect medium. But the execution is spectacularly poor, especially the keyboard dock. Could you imagine buying a desktop PC and having a keyboard that you had to wiggle the connector or push the keyboard to the right slightly, just to get the keyboard to work? Or a laptop where the keyboard wouldn't work consistently if the screen was at a certain angle? That would be unacceptable, and that's precisely what Samsung delivered with this tablet/keyboard. I get the ding-ding-ding sound of docking and undocking every 30-60 seconds, and sometimes it docks/undocks several times each go around. Changing the angle of the tablet can make it better or worse. And since I usually have the sound turned off, I'll look up and see random letters missing as I've been typing.If it were only the keyboard dock it wouldn't merit such a poor review. But I've found the tablet hardware is buggy too. There will be times you turn the tablet back on but the touchscreen has locked up. There was a time before when after a while the sound driver would lock up over time and stop working. Sometimes wifi will stop working randomly. To be fair, the problems have gotten less problematic as updated drivers have been released, but it's still not perfect. My Windows 7 ThinkPad can go weeks going into and out of standby without ever being restarted. This tablet can't seem to go a day without a restart.And don't get me started on the quirks of Windows 8 in general.I do have to admit the battery life is phenomenal. I used the tablet for nine of the thirteen hours on a flight to Asia and had plenty of battery life left. I had to restart the tablet three of four times in the process... but at least it's quick to boot up. This and the fact that it has a pen, which other tablets don't have, is the only redeeming factor. If there was to be another tablet/keyboard combo out there with a pen I'd spring for it.

I'm also very familiar with the iPad and hence have never owned one. The 500T tablet is the ultimate tablet. It does everything the transformer does and everything I missed about a laptop as well. I can use Outlook, iTunes to Sync my iPhone, Netflix (the app works well and has improved a lot since I first used it), Word, Excel and almost all my old windows programs. Since Windows was just released not everything is 100% but it's the best version of Windows I've seen. I love all the new enhancements for Windows 8 and like Windows 7 will miss them greatly if using an older operating system. Microsoft has also integrated the SkyDrive very nicely and I have everything synced going between my tablet and notebook. You don't really need a notebook if you buy this, but I have a very high end notebook for my engineering software. This tablet has a Mini HDMI which works perfectly with Netflix and I love how Windows 8 allows me to search in Netflix so easily!!! The dual camera's on the tablet work well. I love the keyboard and response time on the keyboard of this tablet. It was always something I didn't like about my Asus Transformer (but was glad just to have a detachable keyboard).The biggest question is would I buy this tablet again? Absolutely! I have actually been waiting for a tablet like this for over 2 years since I bought the transformer. I purchased this tablet and I'm not disappointed at all. When you think of the amount of things you cannot do on an iPad or a Android tablet you realize that even though it's been 2 months since the release of Windows 8 it's far superior to both OS's right now!!! I would not go back to Windows 7; Windows 7 was a perfect OS for it's time, but now we have one built on Windows 7 with many added features. I didn't touch Windows Vista as I knew it was a flop. I adopted Windows 95, 98 SE, 2000, XP and 7 early. All OS's were very good for their time.

Of course, the tablet will also run regular Windows programs.  Update: The keyboard disconnect issue seems to have been both a software and mechanical issue.  I have updated all of the software and drivers.  I also find that if I insert the tablet into the dock the way that Samsung says and then push it to the left (while facing the screen) it seems to latch much better.

The only difference between this model and the replacement is a few software changes. The exchange took longer than it should have but the new unit did arrive as promised a week and a half after shipping my faulty unit back. By that time, I had already chosen to sell the replacement and use that money to purchase a smaller Windows 8.1 tablet from Dell that would better fit my needs. Be aware that this tablet will run most of your Windows 8 apps that run in the modern UI with little-to-no lag and will operate most desktop apps with no trouble, but its processor will not handle the same workload one may expect of a good laptop or desktop; neither was it meant to. Because Samsung finally stepped up and took responsibility for the horrible scenario their service and customer support teams put me in, I upgraded my rating to 3 stars, but this problem should never have happened to begin with. This is a decent tablet for light to moderate use and would make a great starter tablet for someone interested in Windows tablets but wishing to retain the ability to run some desktop apps. Keep that in mind when choosing to buy one._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________My initial review for this tablet was very positive; however, I spoke far too soon. When I received the ATIV 500T it had a recurring issue with dropping hidden networks on restart, necessitating the reentry of connection criteria to access the Internet and the Bluetooth card continually failed any outgoing FTP transaction, even though it had no trouble accepting an incoming one. I spoke to customer support sever times over this issue in the first few weeks I had to tablet, refreshed Windows 8 and even did a full factory restore at their recommendation, all to no avail. I was promised the issue would be reported to technical support and never heard another word back from them, even when I initiated contact again a few months later. After roughly 5 1/2 months of using the tablet, the display started to develop image retention in the upper left corner of the screen. Whenever I would switch between screens, an image of whatever had been in the upper-left corner from the previous screen would be visible still on the new screen for a few minutes. Within a week of noticing this, the issue worsened to a 1/4 inch band around all four edges of the display. At that point I contacted the same person with customer support I had dealt with before, and after asking me to refresh Windows again (I don't know what it is with those people, but reinstalling the OS is NOT the answer to EVERYTHING!) he arranged for the tablet to be shipped to a 3rd party repair center to have the display replaced. I got the tablet back almost exactly a week later with two cracks in the plastic frame around the outside edge of the display and the screen showing the exact same image retention issue it had when it left my hand the week before. To be fair, the image retention was back to the milder presence it had when the problem first started, but worsened right back to the same 1/4 inch band on all four edges of the display within a week. I contacted Samsung customer support at which point they filed a claim with UPS, even though I clearly explained to this representative that the tablet was properly packaged in its original box with its original packing material, all of which was packed in a second box and both boxes were in exceptional condition upon receipt. Almost a week later, the representative called and left a voice mail, telling me that UPS refuted the claim and thanked me for giving her the opportunity to help me! I immediately called customer support back and was told that they would be happy to send the tablet BACK to Intelisol, Inc. (the 3rd party repair center) to have the display replaced AGAIN but would take zero responsibility for the damage to my unit! I got the email address for the office of the president of Samsung Electronics America's customer service department and immediately sent a very heated email outlining how Samsung needs to be responsible for the 3rd party organization THEY hire to do warranty work on products purchased by their customers, which was sent four days ago and still has been completely ignored. I resent the message two days later with an automated return receipt request and a notice of read request, both of which I got from addresses within Samsung (tchoe@sea.samsung.com & hnam@sea.samsung.com) but no one has yet to even respond to my request for help. I have been a loyal customer of Samsung's for many years, owning two TV's, Blue-Ray players, and always the latest Samsung Android flagship smartphone (I currently have the Galaxy Note 3, which I have only had to two weeks), and as such, I am appalled at the lack of concern for the deplorable lack of customer service displayed by Samsung in this issue. I am filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau (unfortunately for them, I kept copies of every single email communication I have had regarding this unit from day one) pertaining to the company's complete lack of owning up to their responsibility with this situation.

Windows 8 is a great OS for touchscreens but ATOM hasn't been good for me until now.This is a nice large widescreen tablet.  It has a full USB port (no USB dongle like with the ASUS tablet I used to own), plus it has a micro USB slot, micro HDMI, SIM card.....But in terms of performance, I can play Ilo Milo and Pacman DX from Windows 8.... no problems with performance.  Running other apps is acceptable although it's not as fast as my i7 notebook for work, but I didn't expect it to be.For a device that was supposed to supplement my great Timeline 1830T by Acer, this device is really very nice.  Running 8.1 on it lets me do the snap feature and running HD videos runs great on this.My HD podcasts play back great from within the Zune application I use and even better using Daum PotPlayer when using Overlay mode.For best results I've found the following are useful:1)Turn off Windows Defender.  It just slows down the machine.  Turning it off is like night and day.2)Use Daum PotPlayer and select Video Renderer as Overlay.  Video shows up well and full screen HD playback of H264 Hi-profile runs flawlessly and no major slowdown.3)Audio playback over bluetooth is very nice..... using the headphone jack is just as nice.4)I put TV Mobili on this to stream video over DLNA.  it transcodes the video within seconds and playback runs smoothly on my Bluray player.....  amazing and surprising honestly.  That's a great software to get if you get this tablet.Cons:The keyboard dock is OK, but I bought a great case for this on Amazon and I can't use the dock with it.  To replace that, I bought the Logitech K400r which has a full keyboard and touchpad built in for the modem.  Plug the little dongle in the USB port at the top and you have a full keyboard and mouse that is conveient to bring with you.It's big.  :)  Very big.... but I like big even though I know some of you out there may not.  Video playback is excellent with this so it does what I need.  I have no problems with replacing my notebook with this device.  The 4G LTE modem inside the device adds to what is already a great tablet.Despite the reviews, I think I got an excellent deal.  I bought it for $550 and I've hooked external USB harddrives up to it (no problems).  A bluray drive over USB plugged into it.... no problems.... (haven't played a bluray on it yet, but that's next).  I know that if I ripped the bluray to H264 or used Vudu, I wouldn't think that there'd be an issue.......So the verdict?  Buy it.  If you want a Windows 8 tablet, don't buy RT.  Buy this.  You can run all of your normal apps and if you keep it in perspective as to what you can run on it, you'll have a great time.", "Date": "July 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "No Good at all - Entire series is a manufacturer's defect.", "Author": "Ramasubramaniya Subbiah \"Ram\"", "ReviewID": "R3PT2G5RTQX7GG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Now that I use it, I hate it.Many things I hate.

Buyer beware before buying laptops that have inherent deficiencies such as this.-----I haven't tried a lot, but here is my initial comment - It looks good, but a bit bulky on hand. The Pen is a bit of a hype, doesn't write fast. The keyboard falls off for some reason if you lift the screen. Also the tablet doesn't pop out from the dock unless placed on a surface?! I am not sure though.I liked the OS, its speed. I am not sure if it is going to support a USB internet device.

Howerton", "ReviewID": "RT94O7VV74I0T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this for business use as having the ability to install my custom application directly on the machine is a huge plus for me.  It will literally change the way I do business, improving profit and making life much easier.  It's my first foray into the Win8 OS and I was excited to run the full program.There's lots of positive elements:1. The OS is pretty easy to adjust to if you're already used to touch technology.2. The onboard Spen and Snote software are great additions - an oversight on Apple's part to assume no one wants to write anything anymore.3. The weight is great and the larger screen size enjoyable to have available - an adjustment - but nice to have.4. One button screen rotation lock, USB doc, MicroHDMI plug in, expandable to 128gb with microSD cards, Xbox glass with other great nativeHowever, here's why I returned the device and will be pursuing other options.  Some research demonstrated these are relatively common problems so I wanted to highlight them briefly:1. Application freeze - right out of the box, the unit failed to perform well and froze with various applications.2. Display glitches - when loading Snote in particular, the device would show lines resembling a failing color TV - lots of colors, no clear image, scrambled appearance etc.3. Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) - within 24 hours of having opened the unit, one of the apps froze and then launched the BSOD.  I had to manually shut down the device to get it back up.  Less than 24 hours? Seriously? For a brand new device?4. S-pen not reacting - several times, the S pen just stopped responding and I had to shut down and restart the device to get the recognition back.5. Brightness - the thing constantly kept adjusting for brightness even when I sat in the same place for an extended period of time.  It would go light then dark then light again constantly - very distracting.Device Limitations - other reasons, not defects, I wasn't satisfied.1. Resolution - no Amazon app for windows means using IE and the lower resolution on this item was more disappointing than I thought it would be2. Processing Time - took longer than I expected to load apps, although the navigation worked well and didn't display much lag.3. System management - I felt like the various setting options weren't very well laid out.  Use was easy to adjust to, but I had a difficult time finding the settings I needed to adjust my preferences.Overall, I really really wanted to like it and keep it.  If it worked as expected (without glitches) I would have probably dealt the other issues and upgrade sometime next year.  As it is, I am returning it for the defects and probably looking for a Surface Pro even with the increase in cost.", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "great tablet", "Author": "ahmed kotb", "ReviewID": "R3U18V80VNKJCS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I receive it today till now this is tablet and pc I think windows tablet kill all os others I love it", "Date": "February 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "good stuff", "Author": "eugene", "ReviewID": "RDVCDUVXRKZI8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got it coz its the only tablet that ships to singapore. its  long gives a good edge above other tablets", "Date": "February 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than I expected!", "Author": "Dominic R", "ReviewID": "R31DP2VC2N9IHP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love it.

The dual core atom is definitely an improvement from the last gen but still not enough to run win 8 and multi task. For very basic use i think it could be a nice piece. The design is very cool. I like the tablet itself. Lots of ports, light in weight and very cool layout for the size. Another issue i had was the AC powert input on the tablet. If it was fully inserted it would sitll stick out about an 1/8 inch. When i wiggled it around it lost charging status. Now being my co worker has the same one with no issue i assumed it was jsut an issue with mine. The keyboard dock is pretty useful but its very light and cheap feeling for $129+.
