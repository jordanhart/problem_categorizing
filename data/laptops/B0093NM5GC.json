Looks to be a nice student version of a laptop.. great features and style...  though after checking out the new windows 8 os, I think I will pass on the deal.. Mainly due to Windows 8 preinstalled.. I do doubt that I will upgrade or move into any computer that has Win 8..  way too far out of the working environment I operate in...  Win 8 may be another lossy diversion like Millennium and Vista was...  I will stay with computers that offer Win 7...  sad to see the direction MS is going here...  still I hope that lots of consumers go for the MS 8, makes the older MS 7 pc's cheaper for us working folks...", "Date": "November 23, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0093NM5GC"}}
