{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Looks good, but then you turn it on and use it.", "Author": "Bchaseski", "ReviewID": "R29GJQKEH5KX1C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased the Core i5 model with 500gb hard drive with touch.  I've been using this Ultrabook for about a week and here are my observations.  I'm a software developer and am used to very heavy 17\" notebooks with quad-core processors, a dedicated video card, screaming SSD drives and tons of memory, so this is a huge departure from my 'norm'.The size and weight are very good.  Battery life seems to be just about at 5 hours with casual web surfing and a couple of 30 minute streaming videos from Hulu Plus. The processor (Core i5-xxxx) is fast and the combination of the mechanical 500GB hard drive and the 32gb SSD caching drive provide a fast experience.  I looked into replacing both with a single 256GB SSD drive I had lying around and it is important to note that the 2.5\" drive bay in this is the slim-height kind (7mm).  I figured this would be the case so I'm not deducting any stars for that, but it is important to note in case you think you can upgrade it with any old SSD drive.  That being said, it is going to cost about $200 more for a compatible SSD drive and that would bump the price up to what it would've cost for a core i7 model with 8gb of ram and a 256gb hard drive pre-installed.  I definitely wish I had realized that first as I would've bought that model instead!Screen is okay, definitely bright on the bright settings, however it is glossy and VERY REFLECTIVE.  This is definitely a huge miss as my wife's Lenovo Twist has a great screen that is matte and way more effective to watch/use in any kind of lighting condition compared to my ultrabook.  The resolution is the lowest resolution I've had in quite some time and I definitely can say I am missing 1920X 1080 resolution, however I'll get used to that and am not deducting any stars as I knew that when I ordered it.  I installed Media Center into Windows 8 and hooked this up to a HD Homerun Prime (which is awesome!) and watching HD channels on this is nice, even on Wireless N.  The glare however, is annoying in most lighting conditions.Touchscreen is good, albeit finicky.  I also own a Microsoft Surface that has a terrific touchscreen.  The same applications, such as IE10 \"metro\", on the Surface work with all the gestures great.  On the Sony, it sometimes takes many tries for the swipe down from the top of the screen to open the different tabs that are open or left-swipe in switches apps but doesn't go 'back' in the browser as easily as my Surface.  I don't know if this can be corrected with any sensitivity settings as I haven't looked into that.The keyboard is good. I type pretty quickly and the keys are spaced very well, have good travel, and keep up to my typing just fine.  I don't really like the location of certain function keys like Delete, but that's something that I'll get used to as I use it more for development.  At the price of >$800 I paid, I would've really liked a backlit keyboard, but I knew this when buying it so I'm not deducting any stars for lack thereof, however - hey Sony - start putting backlit keyboards on your ultrabooks!!!The touchpad is quirky.  I have read other reviews where this seems to be the case and I think I can adjust more settings but haven't go down that path yet as I'm trying to get used to 'what's there by default' before I make too many changes.  On of the biggest annoyances is definitely that swiping anywhere close to the left-side of the touchpad will cycle through to the next application instead of moving my cursor to the right.  I don't know that I want to turn that feature off and am trying my best to keep my fingers towards the middle of the touchpad when wanting to move the mouse instead of having a Windows 8 gesture take over.  More on this to come when I get more used to the Sony.FAN NOISE.  This is a very common complaint everywhere on the web about these Ultrabooks.  When I first unpackaged it and turned it on, the fan was screaming right away.  Being that this is supposed to be a sleak & sexy ultrabook, I definitely have to deduct a bunch for this!  I have a Dell Precision M6500 with a quad-core processor in it that doesn't make nearly this much noise from the multiple fans in it.  Granted, it has more room for cooling in it, but Sony should've been able to figure out it's cooling/fan noise better with this.  I really hope that in two years the fan doesn't burn out and I need to replace it!  It seems to be on almost constantly.Ports.  This machine comes with 1 USB 3 and 1 USB 2 port on the left-hand side, which also is where the power core gets plugged in.  It has a FULL sized HDMI port and D-sub port on the right, along with a gigabit network jack, SD slot (and memory stick pro), and a headset jack.  I like the fact that I can use a regular HDMI cable to hook up to an external monitor or television instead of having to buy a special adapter for it.  Kind of wish the D-Sub was a mini display port or mini hdmi or something more 'modern', but it is cool that you can just plug your old monitor into it without a need for another adapter.Wireless.  The wireless is a Atheros AR9485WB-EG adapter.  This means that you cannot use some of the cool features of a core-i5 & Intel Display adapter.  There is a cool technology called Intel WIDI which allows you to wireless display content from a machine that is compatible to your television.  Unfortunately Sony didn't use a compatible Intel wireless adapter in this ultrabook so this isn't available without taking it apart and upgrading the wireless adapter.  I assume this was done to keep the cost down.  Wireless signal seems to be comparible with my other wireless devices throughout the household.Overall, 3/5 stars.  Some of the shortcomings I knew about prior to my purchase, others I learned when it arrived at my house.  I would definitely return it if I could get a refund and search for another ultrabook that wasn't so half-baked, so be sure to read the return policy before you purchase this!!. Sony did a good job in design and aesthetics but missed on basics like an anti-glare screen and the fan constantly running.  Some of the components used could've been better but they probably did this to keep the cost down so I can't take off stars for that.", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fast, portable, and Cool", "Author": "yamaharidr", "ReviewID": "ROW4FB4LGD86X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:PortableFastTOUCH SCREEN!Fun to useMulti Touch TrackpadNo heat issues..yetCons:Only 2 USB PortsNo CD DriveNo Back lit KeyboardI am a full time student, so I am on my laptop off and on all day. The SSD is VERY useful for someone who constantly turns their computer on and off. Boot times are only a few seconds long, and the computer doesn't lag at all once you unlock it. Apps are also pretty fast to load. (2-3 seconds)I was skeptical of the i3 processor, but it has worked flawlessly so far. But after finding out that it was a 3rd gen and a dual core, I felt more secure. I usually have at least four or so tabs open at once. Loading facebook, playing videos off youtube, having multiple tabs for homework, and running  couple apps, while on the charger and with full brightness. I am happy to say that I have noticed no speed problems or lag, even with multiple youtube videos playing at once and a few other tabs open too. I havnt tried any photo or video editing or 3D games, but I probably will in the near future. But to be fair, this laptop isnt made for gamers anyway. Also, I havnt experienced any heating problems yet, other than just slightly warm.The trackpad is very easy to use, and It closely resembles that of one on a Mac Book. The multi touch is a big plus for me, for scrolling though web pages and such. But, this laptop truly shines with the touch screen. Windows 8 is basically made to be used with  tablet, so I really diddnt want to upgrade unless I had a touch screen. But I will say, using Windows 8 on this touchscreen is an absolute blast! It's just plain fun to play with. Its basically like having a tablet with a full keyboard. The touch screen is by far my favorite feature, and I have had no problems with it yet.There aren't as many ports on this laptop as I would like, but that is an easy fix. It only has 2 USB ports, and I use a wireless mouse for one and the other is switched between my phone charger and a flash drive. But, a $6 adapter thingy will add ports instantly, so that's not a big deal. Also, the no CD drive is a bit of a con, but again, those can be found on Amazon for around $30. This laptop does have a VGA port, which I use for my dual monitor. The other ultrabooks dont have one, so that was a definite plus. My last con was that there isn't a back lit keyboard, but after talking to sales representatives at Staples, they all said that the back lit keyboard was just another thing to malfunction and I should stay away from them anyway. Out of the 4 they sold recently (6 months or less), all 4 came back with keyboard problems.I purchased this ultrabook through Staples, where it was on sale for $700 instead of the original $850. I am very happy with my purchase, and just wanted to post a review because I was having trouble finding some myself. So far, this laptop has been lighting fast and very fun to play with. I found one at a good price, jumped on it, and am happy I did so. Not to mention that my friends with the Macs can't stop playing with it :p", "Date": "October 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Initial Thoughts", "Author": "Paul Kim", "ReviewID": "R1YY0VU2FTKBZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony i5 Ultrabook.I have been using an old Sony laptop from 2009, which I traded-in at Sony store.I know that Sony's very reliable, so I decided to go with it again!Overall I am very happy.

So I was skeptical, but I find the screen size to be perfectly fine. It is not small. Good size for basic computing (no gaming, etc.)* Small adapters make it easy to carry aroundDON'T LIKES* Battery life - while it can go for ~5 hours, the screen needs to be dimmed half way* Screen - I am not sure why, but pictures seem too bright.* Takes too long to sleep (under sony's rapid-wake function)* Speakers are only decent. Nothing too fancy* Battery is extremely difficult to remove (you need to unscrew with a coin, but it's hard to turn)OTHER THINGS* Only 2 USBs (fine for me, but maybe a problem for others)* Very minimal number of peripheral ports (VGA, Ethernet, HDMI, audio, 2 USBs) - makes laptop appear simple but maybe a problem for othersOverall I am very happy with my purchase!", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great ultrabook for the price", "Author": "A.

I'm sure it'd be a little more intuitive if I had gone with the touch screen, which I didn't really want at this time. It looks really nice.

The screen is very reflective, it is like looking into a mirror, the contrast of the colors is bad and it has low resolution.If I use the computer at home and close the windows it is fine, there is also the possibility to plug a big screen, which I do, but the all idea of a light computer is to be portable and when I take it to a coffee place, If I can't find a corner without windows, I can't really work on the computer because of the reflections. If this is the price to pay for a touch screen, then it is not worth it.Except that the computer is fast and the touch screen works fine with the Explorer browser. The computer also starts very fast, partly, I guess, thanks to windows 8. At first I was very satisfied with Windows 8 but now I begin to discover some flaws in the user interface, specially I am annoyed that I can't logoff Skype without uninstalling it or shutting the computer. (So I have uninstalled Skype, till they let me logoff at my will).To conclude, although this Sony is a good computer and Sony does great products I would recommend to think well before buying this one, because of the screen.update march 2013Just after 4 or 5 months of having the computer, it doesn't detect the battery anymore.The problems began 1 month ago, when the indication of the battery charge was at 65% at full charge and suddenly it doesn't detect the battery at all, I can only use the computer if plugged to electricity.I now see that others have the same issue with Vaio notebooks.I am on a worldwide trip and the portability issue is very important to me, I went to a Sony store and they had the same computer on exhibition but they refused to let me try their battery on my computer and they sent me to the technical shop in another address. In the shop they did have one used battery by chance and it worked on my computer but they refused to sell me that battery for bureaucracy reasons and they didn't have one new in stock all over the country (weeks to order one). If they could give me one , it would have cost, something like 200 $, as the guarantee doesn't hold between countries.I am very disappointed from Sony, the product and the service.Don't recommend this computer.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony VAIO SVT13122CXS Ultrabook", "Author": "Head of Household", "ReviewID": "RSUL6O0B0WT60", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here we are on Christmas day boxing this sleek ultrabook back into its original packaging for return.

I swallowed it because I didn't want to go through the hassle of returning. My second laptop, HP Pavilion(Windows 7) also had the same problem of random crashes and god-knows-what-caused glitches. My most recent purchase of this Sony VAIO T Series is perhaps the worst purchase of any kind I've ever made in my life up to this point. Not only it's the priciest, it's also the soonest to give out. Everything was fine before I installed the \"recommended\" updates, however, it all went down hill after I was directed to an update for which I wasn't giving an option to say \"NO\" to at the end of my 3rd usage. The next time I tried to turn it on, it simply won't turn on, and just stuck at lock screen regardless whatever key I press.

I was always blaming whatever Internet provider i was using for their bad service, but then would notice everybody else could use it.  I am sitting in my hotel and my iPad is connected, my iPhone5 is connected, my wife's iphone4 is connected, but this Vaio cannot.  Also, windows 8 is GD terrible.  They even have commercials telling how much it doesn't suck, which means it sucks.Added a touchscreen and works pretty decently, but not as well an IPAD. Runs on Windows 8, and all that has brought is annoying features without any discernible improvement over 7. The added features include a quick access to apps, by swiping the touchpad a certain way. Doesn't sound bad, except that you constantly brings up these apps, usually while you are in the middle of something else and it is much harder to close out the apps, as it takes much more precision to close out, than to open. Normal use of the touchpad, i.e. using it the way you have always used a touchpad on every other computer, prompts these features. I have been using daily for a few months and still have not gotten used to it.Another issue with the touchpad, is that the right click feature does not work almost half the time, meaning when I try to right click, it either does not respond or functions as if I had left clicked.I have always used Window computers. I got an IPAD abut a month before this computer. I had no idea what features it had, or any idea about how Apple computers work. However, it took all of five minutes to figure out how it works, yet even though I have only used Windows-based computers, except for my recently purchased iPAD, I still have not gotten used to this one. In fact I had my last VAIO(PC was very disappointing. it lasted maybe a 2 years, before I got so frustrated with it, and it had an unfortunate accident. So I gave it a second chance. My first computer was a VAIO and it lasted over 5 years so I had high hopes for this one. If a little IPAD works so much better than this computer, I can only imagine how much better a MAC notebook will be. I Apple was so GD stubborn about having to have their own special connection, programs, etc, they would have put Windows out of business by now. As it is now they have to deal with all the other companies catching up.Additionally, Internet Explorer constantly freezes up, especially after hitting a quicklink. I am contantly getting the \"windows internet explore has stopped working,\" then the \"searching for solution\" that it never finds, after which all the tabs I have open will restart, and in half the cases, will not restore and you are stuck on a error page the even hitting the back will not take restore your page. It is not my internet connection as this does not ever happen on my IPAD and it happens when I use this computer on other networks. In fact, I had to restart this review as internet explore suddenly quit working and I had to reopen this page. I tried calling Sony's 24 hr costumer service around 1030 PM and was on whole for 43 minutes. I finally hung up without speaking to anybody.In summary: new feature are more annoying than useful, Internet Explorer constantly freezes up (will start using google to see how that works), touchscreen is ok, but not nearly as responsive as IPAD, the whole system is not as fast as an IPAD, touchpad is very annoying takes a lot of getting used to, overall not as easy to use as previous Windows and actually harder to figure simple fucntions.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Where is the SSD hard drive?", "Author": "Y.
