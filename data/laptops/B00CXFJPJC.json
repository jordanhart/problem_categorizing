I also like how quickly it boots up.  It is also a perfect device for users who like cloud services. After researching this computer online, I found that Google Docs can be saved as a Word doc, can be used \"offline\", and I found all the necessary steps to reboot in case there is a problem with the OS, how to 'clean' the computer if necessary, and steps on how to add your own screensaver. There is a 'Get Started' app which takes the user through many important features for beginners. The keyboard feel as comfortable and easy on the fingers as my Windows PC.  I love that updates are in the background so I would not have to be kicked out like in Windows based OS. I also like that security is built-in so that I don't have to purchase anti-virus/spyware/malware or set up nightly or weekly updates.  The laptop is very light and I have no problems with brightness and the colors are vivid when watching movies. I have used my USB stick which houses all my Word docs and have had no problems accessing those files.  I would definitely recommend this for those tired of Windows based OS!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Chromebook", "Author": "M.

Since all they do was check email and watch videos online i gave it a shot since it was fairly cheap. Best decision i every made. the chrome browser is exactly the same as the windows one so that didn't need explaining also its light weight and since its a chrome operating system and not windows, its very hard to get a virus on it (just like a mac)Pros:cheap, easy to use, fast start up time(around 5 seconds), 720p hdmi out, light weightcons: only 16gb of storage, very small battery, flash is buggy sometimes but tolerable,  no programs (no skype,firefox,ect)overall: i would highly recommend this for anyone just looking for a laptop to surf the web and nothing else.i also recommend buying a SD card to expand storage because this does have a SD card slot.but i would only buy this around $250. $300 is a bit high for me because of the weak processor  and lack of a hard drive. I really wish i could install chrome os on my old laptop because it uses very little resources unlike windows.tips: if you usually use skype your can use google hangouts to video chat!. if you use office, you can use google docs(might take some time to learn the new format) but its almost as good! and its free.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Better than expected, by far.", "Author": "jeffrey ulrich", "ReviewID": "R11X5B7RFX3ZKK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Beautiful machine that is fast as lightning, I can't believe how rugged this feels compared to the smaller chromebooks. This machine is built to last with quality construction and a sturdy keyboard, it's not a cheap product at all. The functions perform flawlessly and can run numerous apps at once with zero lag, ZERO!!! The drawback is no optical drive, but I purchased through HP a USB multi drive and now the system is totally dialed in. I Love It! I can do any office app through Google office and I couldnt be happier.Thanks HP for continuing to make kick ass products. I am a loyal HP fan for life. 2nd HP computer purchase this year and they just keep getting better! Good Job and great engineering!! Keep it up.", "Date": "October 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Is The Future!", "Author": "Steven Campos", "ReviewID": "R2Z1K70JWSBKTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Lets just say that when it comes to do anything a computer does this Chromebook does it. First of all if your looking to put Photoshop or any other CPU intensive program this is not the laptop for you. There is no CD drive. It only has USB ports and HDMI port. I have always used Windows and Windows is great but as I figured out real quick this Chromebook can do all of that it.Google whole basis for this is something called \"cloud computing.\" Nothing is downloaded to your hard drive. Instead it all goes to your Google Drive. If you need something you need you can download an \"app\". Google Docs is the the Microsoft equivalent of Office. And its available online or offline. It does take some getting use to. You can save pictures, videos, musics etc to Google Drive. Everything you do is done on Google Chrome. For some people doing everything in a web browser is unheard of.Perhaps my favorite thing about this Chromebook is that the fact there is no software at all needed for it. No CD's or anything just open it and you can get started. One thing to note is that you must have internet for it. Your not completely limited if you don't but to get the most out this Chromebook you need internet. I am always on the go and have internet so this isn't a problem for me.As far as looks go I like it. The screen may not be HD but its big enough and honestly why do you need an HD screen on a laptop anyways? It is fast. Does not lag no matter what I do. Watch Netflix or go on YouTube. There is slight \"hum\" but that's about it. You can even put it in your lap and does not get too hot. It also has a camera in the front and its of pretty good quality. Battery life is amazing. The keyboard is nice. Sound is LOUD. Best part of all it turns on in under 10 seconds. No other computer or laptop on the market can do that.Overall this Chromebook is meant for the person who is just looking to do easy things such typing documents or suffering the web. You can't do anything graphic intense as this Chromebook is not meant for that. Remember this is meant for your average person. Not for your gamer (that's what a game console is meant for) or photo editor. Just remember this is what the future is.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is the future!!!", "Author": "Donald Castellano-hoyt", "ReviewID": "R26VSSR6WBDHWE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had done my research for months prior to buying this Chromebook.

Nonetheless I actually plan to buy another one fairly soon (probably an 11 incher) just because it travels well and boots fast!The rest of the family still struggles with the desktop 'wait time' while I can check my emails and be off my Chromebook within a minute!I like that Google lived up to its promise and gave me 2 years' of storage (100 g).

Tired of the cursing and dropping of laptops, I bought him a 'pre-scratched', broken in model which was otherwise like new. I setup his Gmail account and plopped it in his lap. At first he was certain there would be nothing better about this laptop than others he'd tried before, but after an hour of using it he exclaimed: \"THIS IS GREAT!\" (High praise for a man of few words.)The HP Chromebook with the 14\" screen is great, for some users. Ideal for those who are not particularly computer savvy, or those users who have primarily web-based needs. Also good for students and travelers who again, use web-based applications and don't plan on installing software on their laptop. For example, I like to travel with a Chromebook because they are lightweight and I use both Gmail and Google Drive all the time. If I was in need of using MS Office, or a photo editing program like Corel's PaintShop Pro X6 (non-web based) - I'd want a different device.To surf the web, use web-based email programs like Microsoft's Outlook, Yahoo, Gmail or similar, and to stream to a Chromecast device via a WebStore Chrome browser extension - this Chromebook works very well.To play non-web based games which must be installed via a CD/DVD player; not on a Chromebook, or to do photo or video editing, or to use any software that installs on your computer versus being played in an internet browser - forget about it. Buy a laptop with a Windows operating system or a Mac instead.The Chromebook will not replace a Windows based operating system PC in terms of functionality. It just won't. That doesn't mean it's a bad device, but it is limited.Ideal for 'simple' use, quick, portable, with a nice sized 14\" screen (I wouldn't bother with the 11\" screen, but that's me...), and full-sized keyboard, the HP Chromebook 14-c050 was a very good option for my Windows-challenged husband. He's happy. I'm happy. And it works as expected. I recommend Chromebooks, as long as you know what you're getting, and also know what your needs are and whether or not this device can make things happen for you.NOTE:  If you just can't fathom carrying a Windows-based PC laptop around, consider a Windows Surface tablet instead.NOTE: You can use Chromebooks to pair with Chromecast devices (any laptop with a Chrome browser can do this too) via a Chrome browser Chromecast extension, to 'cast' or mirror content on any connected HDTV!  It's a great way to supplement free over-the-air TV, which I mention in my book: Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV.", "Date": "April 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Computer for Young Adults", "Author": "John Yeary \"John Yeary Greenville Java Users ...", "ReviewID": "RNWEVIU99Z9LX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The computer is really nice for my son who likes the larger screen vs. the Acer C7 Chromebook which is much smaller.

I bought this laptop after being persuaded by a salesman at Office Max that it was the better choice over the regular 17' HP laptop. After opening the laptop and beginning to use it I noticed some things were very different. You cannot download any Microsoft Office software and many other things, such as oovoo. When using Google Docs(aka the Microsoft Word of Google Chrome) you have to have an internet connection just for it to save.  The worst con for me was the fact that you can only print from this laptop if it is a wireless printer. Tryand connect a regular printer all you want but it won't work.
