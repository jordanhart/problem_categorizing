I've had it for around a month. It was a bit bigger than I thought it would be, but its relatively light for its size. So far I have no complaints other than the battery life which I knew about coming in. I'm currently in the process of trying to find an extended battery. My only other complaint is that the screen was not quite as sharp as I expected it to be based on the pics on the website and I have tried to change all the settings and increase the brightness etc.All in all though, for around the price of a netbook I have a good desktop replacement.", "Date": "December 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it...", "Author": "Lorri A.
