In this model I like the thin design. The lifelong problem is that led lights white are to the side. The price was accessible according to my basic configuration.

Thanks Jose from Argentina--to April 10th, without problems!", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT LAPTOP", "Author": "alc60", "ReviewID": "R2O1YZM5ZA2K5Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's quick.
