{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Prompt delivery of a ver good product", "Author": "Willy", "ReviewID": "R2IEG3TWHZUF9B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "A used laptop, yes, but in very good condition.  Ready to go with Windows 7,  Office, antivirus, and all software to run all aspects of the laptop.  Even had several other useful programs listed.Hard drive was 160 GB, not 250 GB.....Minor diference to meRam was as listedIntel Core 2 2.53 GHz is faster than listed.....a big improvement.Why down to four stars?Delivery packaging was questionable, but there seems to be no damage to the laptop.  The OS was Windows 7, but for five days now the system has been updating every time I shut down.....really no big problem because I have it set to automatically update.  A couple of stickers on the cover show the previous owner......I can live with this, and maybe if I take the time I can remove them.For today, it is down to three stars because I do not have the operating code (25 characters) for the Windows 7.  I only find the code for the origional Vista system.I hope the seller will supply the codes in which case I agree with a 4 star rating even 4 1/2 or 4 3/4.  The computer is what I hoped for and it does everything I have asked of it.I hope to update this review soon.", "Date": "May 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "it is everything i expected and so much more...", "Author": "Todd Tonkin", "ReviewID": "R2O4JLM1N1BCE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the unit is so much more than i expected and more. i would choose this unit again if needed. again i believe it has the best value for the money.", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "-HP Elitebook 6730B -Intel Core 2 2.4GHz\n-2GB Ram -250GB Hard Drive\n-15.4\" -DVDRW\n-WiFi -Notebook Avenue 30 Day Warranty", "Name": "HP 6730B Laptop, Intel Core 2 2.4GHz, Mem 2GB, HD 250GB, DVDRW, 15.4\" LCD", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41uc5EStzeL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009ISRJHW"}}
