Of course, out of warranty.  Had to take it to an Apple store an hour and a half away from home.  Cost me the price of a cheap PC to fix it, not including gas back and forth twice.  Lesson?  Buy a cheap PC.Update:  2 months later, the Apple Store fix didn't last and have to drive another hour and a half for another proposed fix.  Back and forth, for a total of 6 hours each time (there and back to drop off, there and back to pick up)...so am now into 12 hours of drive time to have this machine fixed.Don't do it!  Buy a PC!", "Date": "March 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the price", "Author": "Gerald", "ReviewID": "R33TEITAY3VGP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After considering many lower cost PC options, I went with the MacBook.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Overall design factors include a superior track pad interface, solid construction, back-lit keyboard, superior OS, terrific display, etc.  There are some higher end PC notebook solutions available but the cost difference really isn't that much between these solutions and the MacBook.  You get what you pay for and them some with this MacBook.I have no need to use an external mouse with this notebook due to an inferior track-pad interface found on most PC notebooks.  I have observed that the mouse pointer will jump around at times on PC notebooks due to sensitivity issues.  Other reviewers have observed the same behavior. This is likely due to the sensing of the palm by the track-pad.  Additionally, the track-pad on the PC solutions is often too small.  Often, these solutions need to include at least two buttons for left and right clicking and sometimes four just to accommodate users who are accustom to using buttons on the top or bottom of the track-pad.  The track-pad on the MacBook is a button itself and that is all that is needed.  Apple in effect is telling users to evolve and you will be better off.One thing worth noting about the MacBook is it does have sharp edges.  This allows the notebook to close such that there is no gap around the perimeter of the notebook.  However, if you are a user that rests your wrists on the notebook while typing instead of letting them float above the keypad, you will get many creases on your wrists and will likely feel some irritation.  This may ultimately result in more significant wrist injuries. When I first started using this notebook, my wrists did exhibit these creases so I adjusted my typing position by floating my hands above the keyboard as recommended.  Problem solved!  Apple design engineers are in effect saying \"learn to type correctly.\"  Additionally, I purchased the following item to place the MacBook in a slanted orientation.  It also helps with heat dissipation and is very portable.  Having the notebook in the slanted orientation will also fix the issue with the sharp edges if you insist on not floating your hands above the keyboard while typing. I highly recommend it:Hercules X-Stand Ergonomic Portable Natural Airflow Cooling Stand For all 12-17\" Laptop / Notebook ComputersI decided to go with the 1680 x 1050 display rather than the lower resolution display.  I believe that this is definitely worth the extra money.  Additionally, I considered the matte screen to mitigate the effects of screen reflections but ultimately decided to go with the glossy screen due to its vibrancy.  There can be issues with reflections so if you are a user that has a window directly behind you or work in an environment that has bright lights, you may want to opt for the matte screen. Reflections have not been an issue for me.  I recommend the glossy screen for most users.My system has 8 Gig of RAM.  Running a few applications will eat up memory fairly quickly.  Once memory runs low, the OS will need to swap memory to the hard disk thus compromising performance.  According to Apple, use of RAM that is not exactly the same as what is specified (same specs and manufacture) will void the warranty.  You may want to consider that if you are looking at the possibility of adding your own RAM which you can do for significantly less than what Apple charges which is $200 for 4 Gig more than the base model which has 4 Gig of RAM itself.  Contact Apple first if you have any doubts about such warranty issues.In summary,  all of the components of the MacBook are integrated so well with the OS that it is truly the superior solution. This is simply because Apple has virtually complete control of the OS and hardware.  Without going into the technical details here, this makes a huge difference when compared to solutions based on Windows that need to accommodate multiple hardware platforms from many notebook manufactures.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop - Long time mac user", "Author": "Yolanda", "ReviewID": "R5NUQGHW7JP7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was little concern about the battery and heat before my purchase because all reports that has been posted on the internet.

The trackpad and battery are such great conveniences especially since I'm using mine for college. It looks great, runs great, and EXCELLENT customer service from Apple.Alright I've spent 30 minutes trying to think of other things that I like about this laptop. Now here's the thing, it's probably just me, but I don't see anything that makes this laptop better than a PC. My main reason of getting this laptop was to see how great it was, since everyone was talking about it, and recommending it to me. I've had it for 4 months now, and I have no clear idea of how it could beat a laptop that's half its price. I love playing Starcraft 2, but I have to run it on the lowest settings, while my PC with the same specifications can run it on high. So either right now, there's nothing different, or I'm not utilizing my Macbook Pro to its fullest potential. If I am, someone please comment so I could get a better experience with this.Don't get me wrong, it's still a great laptop, and I love the thing, but I do regret switching. I swear I'm not a troll looking to start a PC vs Mac war, I just want to state my opinions, and hopefully someone tells me whether I'm wrong or right with a reason why.EDIT: Let's make this clear, I didn't buy this laptop for gaming. I bought it mainly based on recommendations, battery life, and durability.Thanks Nathan and Geib, I just ordered the 8 GB RAM, and it should be here soon. I don't think I would've searched for them since, I didn't think they'd be that cheap (well... not cheap, but a low price compared to what I was thinking haha).As for viruses, I never got them with my PC, but it's nice to know that it's not just luck that I'm not getting them lol.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing", "Author": "YUTING HUANG", "ReviewID": "R3NFO5MZCMJTAA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having started using PC since late 80s I have owned at least 20+ PCs and this is my first MAC.

I was very surprised on how well the product was designed and the pleasure one gets just looking at it, its by far the best looking laptop out there, but once I started using it became apparent that I was in for a surprise.  I know a little more than the average user about computers and will let you know the pros and cons as I experienced them.Pros- Best laptop design out there. Very nice Aluminum design.- Very Good battery life.  Once the brightness is adjusted to auto.- Best trackpad i've ever used.  It can recognized whether I have 3 fingers on it or just one.  Great.- Backlit keyboard.  Very nice and it turns on automatically depending on light.- Great Webcam.  The webcam is great, very nice resolution.- Solid State Drive.  I payed extra for it but its definately worth it.Semi-consThese Semi cons are because of the awesome design.- Only 2 usb ports.- No additional battery support or interchangable for that matter. The battery is good but not infinite, need more juice.- Can't support mini discs but then again barely anyone uses those, but I mention it because I bought a amplified wifi adaptor that brought one and had to save the drivers on hd first.CONS (hardware)Where do I start there are so many cons that I will just focus on the ones that affected me directly.- No Bluray drive.  I have a PS3, tons of blurays and couldn't take any of my movies with me on the road.- No USB 3.0 support.  I bought a hard drive that is usb 3.0 but couldnt take advantage of the speed.  I have an internal SSD and the speed would've helped.- No HDMI built in. I had to buy a separate adaptor for it, this is a con because I payed $2200 for my Mac and I didn't want to spend more money.- The fan kept coming on when I was running Parallels in order to use much needed Windows features (read the other cons to know why).  A laptop fan helped ease that but I noticed the Aluminum was coming back to bite me on this one as it was loud.CONS (software)This is where I don't like this machine. At first it seemed I didn't need anything else and I would be able to do everything, but then it became apparent that I would be needing a lot.- No NTFS write support.  I found myself trying to copy things into my old hard drive and couldn't do it.  I would drag files to it and they wouldn't drop, no warning, nothing.  I did some research and found out that you can't do that without buying software.  At least Mac OS should let you know it's not supported, instead they choose not to let you know. Linux even supports this.- No games.  No games worth playing are available for the MacOS, I wanted to play some games on my down time and was surprised as to the games that are actually available.- Lack of software.  If I wanted to find a software for whatever it may be, all I had to do was search and I was almost guaranteed to find it for windows, with the Mac is kind of a surprise, \"like wow it's on the Mac too, sweet\".  Windows would be needed for lots of business programs.- Quicktime player.  I was wondering exactly what does Quicktime support and basically 2 file formats which didn't work for me since most of my stuff is in Divx and WMV.  I had to download VLC.  The main reason why this is a CON is because i shouldn't have to download a tool for every little thing I want to do.- Using Windows.  This is a con because Apple sells their operating system as the most advance but yet feel the need to include bootcamp so you can put Windows.  I don't get it but there are even companies that sell software so you can run windows within Mac OS which clearly fixes a lot of problems with Mac, but it shouldn't come down to that.  Windows doesn't support you to use MAC OS (even though Apple makes it illegal) or linux for that matter and i'm not talking about dual boot or virtual machines, I'm talking about using them at the same time like with Fusion or Parallels (virtual but integrates windows with Mac OS). The way I feel is that if you say your operating system is the best you shouldn't include a way to use the inferior one.  Obviously Mac OS lost points with me on that one, basically saying that they lack features and you should use Windows.- No customization.  You basically can't customize anything and I mean anything. its hard to find programs on there also, if you dont have them on the dock.The list can go on but these were things that bothered me and when you factor in price, this is not the best thing I couldve done for $2200 plus all the software.It looks nice but in the end falls short to live up to the hype of replacing a windows machine for the more advanced user.  I need the ability to own the system and customise it however I please.  In the end I decided to go back to a Windows 7  machine which can do anything Lion can do and much much more.  One of the main selling points was the lack of viruses for Mac, but I noticed that if you don't go looking around the internet for free stuff from shady sites or clicking spam, you shouldn't even need anti-virus for your Mac or PC.  Windows PCs are bigger targets due to more than 90 percent of the computers out there.I went back to the Apple store to return the product and they tried selling me on keeping it by telling me it can do all this stuff but once I started asking the hard questions I started getting \"it's a Mac\" from the salesperson, like I was supposed to forget about what I use a computer for and keep cause \"mac is cool\".  In my research the only thing that a Mac can do that a windows machine can't is run Apple made software like Final Cut Pro.  It became apparent at the Apple store that the main feature it offers is the ability to run Windows.I didn't like the product and hope my review will be able to educate someone on the fence on whether it is worth the price.  People will disagree with my review I'm sure but I have wrote the honest truth and no one can argue with the facts.  In the commercials Apple makes it sound like it's the most advanced thing ever and in the end maybe its too advance, coming from the future where no one uses Bluray, USB 3.0 or does actual work on their computers just surf the web and spend hours of time building ficticious farms.Thanks.Final word: Audi talks trash on BMW but doesn't feel the need to include a way to use a BMW engine in their cars.

Unfortunately, it is so loud it can be heard when talking to someone on the phone by the person at the other end.2.  The battery life is terrible.  2-3 hours max.  Again, not unique to my laptop.  It's more of a portable desktop than something that can be used unplugged.3.  The hard drive performance is terrible.  IU don't recall my intel mac mini being dog slow.

As a college student, the sticker shock blew me away, but I decided to buy it anyways. Now I am a very satisfied owner, I've used my laptop about six hours a day average probably, all my classes are online and I love computer games. Since my purchase, I've upgraded my MacBook by replacing the factory default 4GB of memory with 8GB, and I've replaced the Superdrive with an SSD (Note: like many other 8,2 models, there's a problem where the computer's dvd bay doesn't actually work with the 6GB/S SATA standard, thus the bay actually holds the old hard drive, and the SSD is in the hard drive bay) and everything (Including TRIM support) has worked flawlessly. I was honestly amazed at how simple it is to upgrade this laptop. It's very ergonomic, the screen is beautiful, it's very comfortable to type on. I love the adjustable screen brightness, as well as adjustable keyboard backlighting, and the switchable dual graphics cards. It's not hard to squeeze hours of battery life out of this computer (especially when you download GFX status, a tiny program that lets you choose which graphics card to use instead of letting mac OSX pick for you). The graphics card is decently powerful, I'm pretty into video gaming and this thing definitely plays most games at medium settings, but keep in mind it's not a gaming laptop, and especially not a gaming desktop. Installing Windows 7 is a breeze (though you lose some of the features, like switchable graphics cards). I think it's very portable (I carry it on me constantly, even if I don't think I'll need it that day). I only really have two complaints:1) with an EFI/UEFI boot system, apple seems to have done everything they possibly can to make it tough as nails to install a new operating system (I'm talking about Linux of course), though this is the case with every Mac and isn't specific to this laptop2) I use WINE a lot to play PC games on my macbook, but the fact that it has an AMD graphics card and not an NVIDIA makes it a lot harder, since NVIDIA has much better drivers (for the other 95% of you this won't make a difference, the graphics card is great, it's just not NVIDIA). This is also annoying when using UNIX because the AMD drivers tend to be pretty crappy compared to the NVIDIA ones.Now for the surprising part: If I went back and made the decision again, I wouldn't buy this laptop. I think the 15\" screen is great, but I would definitely have like having the 17\" model more I think.

I love everything about this machine.  The performance, the look, feel, display, OS, utilities, apps, and keyboard are great. The only small issue is that it gets a little hot. It doesn't belong on a lap. I guess that's why it's not called a laptop. It is not cheap but if you use a computer all of the time, IMHO it is worth it. I enjoy using it everyday. Why not make your daily experience as good as it can be?", "Date": "July 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK", "Author": "Caloub", "ReviewID": "R2YD1PTUW0AB5R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great computer, I'm 100% satisfied, love it, with the additional memory it's even better, and It's beautiful.

The only good thing about HP was the return process which was quick and easy. I decided to try the Mac and I am glad I did. What a product, what an experience. I am so in love with the machine.
