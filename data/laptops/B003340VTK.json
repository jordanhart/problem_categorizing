{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Cherry Coke\"", "ReviewID": "R3FSTY1FZ8CTVM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I picked this laptop up last night. It was the only high end brand I could find with HDMI and blu-ray under $800 that had good processing ability along with other specific features I wanted... and I looked... and looked... and looked... The white keys and bright display are helpful if you occasionally use your laptop in the dark (though having a back lit keyboard would have been a nice bonus). Compared to all prior, dark cased laptops, I can finally see the keys clearly. Ive had a Vaio in the past and it's build quality was excellent. I once again can say that it feels like a solid laptop and I am going to be quite happy with it. This laptop's design is straight forward and relies highly on the function keys. Advanced users might appreciate the simplicity and straight forwardness of this laptop more than the average or novice who may need things more specifically laid out (or if you are a big fan of buttons).It features a boot to internet button to quickly bypass its already speedy Windows 7 boot process.Blu-Ray looks great. The only disappointment ive had with it is the speakers, but I havent had enough opportunity to truly judge them yet. I put in a blu-ray movie last night and it was so quiet at full volume I had trouble hearing it. Granted, normal Windows volume had a decent projection so I probably just need to check a few things out that I havent gotten around to yet.The HDMI port along with the Blu-Ray allows me to connect it to my TV and gives me the option of removing the entertainment desktop I have next to my tv.Would I buy it again? Definitely.Side note: I love Amazon, but I found it for $730 in store. Sorry Amazon but you were a little too expensive this time around!", "Date": "March 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sony Vaio NW350", "Author": "Mother of four", "ReviewID": "R3P9JPZ1SONYJ0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this to replace a SonyFE model.  I was pretty happy with the FE but wanted to upgrade to a new computer because I need better specs.  Overall I am pleased with the NW model.  I love the texture of the case and the silver color.  Windows 7 is easy to navigate through once you get used to the change from XP.  It is much faster that my older sony.  The reason I did not give it 5 stars is because I prefer the old screen.  It is much crisper and easier on the eyes.  The Sony NW screen doesn't seem as bright or maybe the contrast is off and almost looks faded compared to the FE model.  I read somewhere that is is due to the technology differences behind the screens.  We also recently purchased and HP610 and prefer the screen over the Sony.  Side by side the HP Screen is much better.  The speakers on both are not that great and it is difficult to listen to webinars.  Thank goodness for earphones.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Smartest choice...", "Author": "gwyneth", "ReviewID": "R2Y6QD02VYNSQM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop about 6 months ago, and am so glad that I did! I was hoping to spend $500-600, as I figured these days you can get somewhat of a decent comp for that price. I was looking at a Gateway with a 17\" screen, which I thought would be nice for my art and photography... But THEN I took a walk on the wild side to the nicer lineup of comp's and saw this Sony. It is quiet (you dont even hear the fan running), fast, doesnt get hot, easy to type, amazing HD qualities, awesome windows 7, web startup with a press of a button, etc... I was very worried about spending $750 or so, when buying a MAC is only a few hundred dollars more. (I'm a MAC lover!)... But really, this is a great computer with everything that I need (and some). Dont settle for a crappy machine when for a little more you can have this reliable smooth Sony. Best Buy has an 18 month no-interest deal on their credit card, which I did. You wont be dissapointed...", "Date": "July 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "I HATE IT", "Author": "Luanne Black", "ReviewID": "R3GFK1MJGRGLJ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sorry......but.. the one I bought in 2010, I paid (with taxes,shipping,) about $800.00 ON SALE.. I think it was...Best Buy on line..anyhow, Had it a year, it was a manufacture's defect in the SD card USB area. That fried my C driver...(extended warrantee was outrageous)so had that fixed.. I suppose the kid put a trial Windows on it.. well, shortly after that expired...the C driver that I put about $150.00 into...FRIED AGAIN..so.. I am now having to EAT almost a thousand dollars and hope to sell it on EBay for parts.. I'm lucky to get $150 dollars for it so I can clear at least $100.00 and the shipping and handling costs.. I'LL NEVER EVER BUY ANYTHING COMPUTER WITH SONY ON IT.. Sony has great camera's and music equipment..but...STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING computerized with Sony...", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great, but a few issues", "Author": "ADavis", "ReviewID": "R30WV2VHEU6YF9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great computer. No, the screen isn't the greatest, but I got it in store for under $700. Also, it's LOADED with Sony software, which occasionally takes up all the RAM, slowing it down. Other than that, I love it. HDMI output is great. The keys on the keyboard are spaced perfectly for my big hands. My girlfriend told me that she finds the touch pad hard to use, but I like it. I would absolutely recommend this computer to a friend.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Good Laptop, Great Value.", "Author": "JayConsumer", "ReviewID": "R784NCEOVGP9C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a big Sony guy but I'll give them credit here.  I own this exact laptop and it has been a champ.  True the sound is bad, but its exactly the same as most laptops.  The unit has been most solid with a sturdy aluminum case, good hinges, a fantastic keyboard, Blu-Ray and a good display.  Love the Wi-Fi physical switch.  This is a word processing beast with no number pad and white, well-spaced keys.  We paid $709.99 @ BB in March 2010 and I still use the heck out of it.  Not a powerhouse gamer, only has 4GB and a 5400rpm drive, but respectable enough for most use.  I am seriously considering putting in a hi-perf hd, maxing the RAM and going to Win8.1---versus getting a new laptop.Minuses: The unit stays cool, but still eats the battery in ~2 hrs.  Replacements are $$$.  The 5400rpm drive is a hindrance.I disagree with the unhappy rater below.  He should have had it fixed properly if it failed, and letting \"the kid\" install a bogus OS on it was a really stupid mistake.  Most laptop HD failures are cause by rough handling.  Sony can only do so much and I'd stack my Vaio up against ANY Gateway,ASUS, HP, Toshiba or Acer as far as build quality.", "Date": "February 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it, love it!", "Author": "Mocha J", "ReviewID": "RVOCCXEBD12NT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband got me this for Valentine's Day, and I've been thrilled!  He's a big techno-guy, so he was pretty picky about what he wanted the computer to handle.  Its speed is great, screen clarity too. And it was a bonus to have the blu-ray palyer built in!  Me? I was looking for a good size and weight that didn't make me feel like I was dragging around a stone tablet from room to room.  And I really like the textured touch pad. It doesn't get sticky, and it responds smoothly. Of course, the Amazon price was nice, even after looking at the model at a big box store.... But mostly, it's been a good choice for my everyday use.", "Date": "June 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love It", "Author": "Oscar Mesta", "ReviewID": "R1LL6634YJFP30", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my third Sony Vaio of this version.I have lost one,broke one and spilled water on another.Love the birch bark texture.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "15.5\" LCD display; 320GB Hard Drive; 4GB Memory\nMicrosoft Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit)A great value in a gracefully slim 15.5 notebook.\nHDMI Connection OutputWireless: Atheros 802.11b/g/n Wireless Network Connection\nBuilt-in Blu-ray DVD player.", "Name": "Sony VAIO VGN-NW350F/S 15.5\" 4GB 320GB Laptop Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41vGjsZGh6L.jpg", "ProductID": "B003340VTK"}}
