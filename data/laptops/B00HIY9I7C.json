Would be great if it has option for better processor upgrade- Stand Mode problem. Stand Mode was expected for presentation or multimedia playback.  However, the speaker is built in a wrong position.  When in notebook mode, the speaker is built at the bottom of the notebook and facing down; while in Stand Mode it inverted and get worsen for the speaker then at the back, behind the screen, and facing the sky, resulting the sound clarity got worsen.  It would be great if the speaker is designed and placed at somewhere nearer to the screen.- Built-In Battery.  This is the only notebook that I ever seen that comes with built-in battery, which means when the battery died, you can't get the battery replaced.  Seems like Lenovo intended to build it as a disposable unit and not intend for long lasting.With the built-in battery, I don't expect this unit to last more than 2.5 years before I need to get a replacement unit.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "A GOOD TABLET COMPUTER FOR THE PRICE", "Author": "P Machine \"ELEL\"", "ReviewID": "R194VMS72U45FB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'll be honest this are few of my cons and pros..CONS: -Battery sucks! only last 3 hrs.. if you put on energy saver (dim screen) maybe you get 4hrs juice out of it.  Not sure how we'll replace the battery if it gets depleted. Battery is built internal.  -Web cam sucks! Low light or bright light very low definition, if you do a lot of Skype or web chat not recommended  -When watching Netfix, the screen will flicker every 30 sec or so. Had to do a little research and you have to go to screen  resolution and change the 60hz to 40hz. I love to watch movies and its very frustrating if no one knows what's wrong.  almost returned it. I thought it was a lemon. hope Lenovo will put that as a hint on the manual or something.  -This happened to me several times that the screen freezes for a few seconds and then touch screen will no longer work.  Now you have to either use the touchpad, reset, or refresh screen and all windows will have to close.  - The Windows closed [X] button is right next to volume up! This always happens to me, when I just wanted to make the volume louder, but I always press the windows close button by mistake and it will close all windows that you have! very frustrating. Not sure why Lenovo designed the button right next to the volume up where you often use it. A Big No No..PROS: Free Microsoft office 2013 - excel, power point, word, one note.  Able to switch from tablet to desktop  One of the smallest laptop tablet out there! really small, great for traveling for its very light  Quality and solid built.***** I will still recommend this laptop because of its price.

My favorite apps don't even exist within Microsoft's resources.  I was trying to find a pad that would meet my needs all-in-one. I did not find it in the Lenovo.  I did not find it in Lenovo Support over the phone or online. Instead, I found the Lenovo Support a horrible experience. It took 4 phone calls and 5 support staffers to answer my question.  They were poorly trained--that coupled with limited English language skills, made the  phone experience last over 6 hours.  Sad to say, my  tired, old, former Motorola Xoom was a better product than this.  My Samsung Galaxy Note 2 is a highly superior product.  My Sony Vaio 19\" laptop is a much better product.

Check it out in Lenovo website. It will say that the warranty is from 13 Feb 2014 (which is actually the manufacturing date and not my purchase date!).Two reasons why this product even got 2 stars from me.First star - It is cheap (cost me S$599) and it works ok.Second star - It is light-weight and hence portable.These aside, this laptop isn't worth your money.(1) It is slow...very slow and low in performance (even for web surfing)(2) Battery life is very very poor (I had to buy another charger to keep in office). At most, with basic stuff such as using the browser, using one-note and an occasional word/excel, the battery runs out at less than 3 hours(3) The touch screen very often doesn't response till you put the laptop to sleep and wake it again. I believe another reviewer mentioned this too. I've opened a ticket with Lenovo and still waiting for them to give me a resolution.Anyway, I'm reviewing the Lenovo 11s (with 4th generation CPU core) and hopefully this will be a better portable laptop for me - but of course at twice the price (S$1399).Feel free to ask questions.

It's small (smaller than a standard sheet of paper) but that was a plus for me as it's easy to carry around.

I don't have to do a lot on the laptop so I just needed one that worked when I needed it and that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg.  The built-in speakers are really bad.  If you want to listen to audio, you'll need wireless speakers or headphones.  It's a little slow so if that's a problem for you, don't buy this computer.
