{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Don't know why this computer is being knocked so hard...", "Author": "guitargirl67", "ReviewID": "RMCLBJWHAQMKS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After reading the reviews on this computer, I just want to say that, compared to other laptops from various manufacturers (Apple, HP, Dell, etc.), this computer is by far the most well built computer I have ever come across. I have taken this computer to school with me EVERYDAY for the last 3+ years and not yet has it slowed down, even by the tiniest bit. I've never had any hardware or software problems nor any of the problems that people seem to be complaining about. (FYI-If you treat any computer like a piece of meat, it will break, regardless of who made it). I just wanted to write a positive review about this computer because I am still very happy with its performance (especially being 3+ years old) and do not intend on buying another laptop anytime soon.", "Date": "August 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop.....users here don't know how to use a laptop.", "Author": "A.

The other posters here are obviously computer illiterate.  Most of their problems stem from the fact that they don't know how to use a laptop nor the software.  When I had a question for Lenovo Tech, I got through almost immediately and had my question answered.  I would suggest that te other unhappy Lenovo users that posted here go back to a Corona typewriter, save yourself some grief.", "Date": "July 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent Machine!

All that changed when I wanted to show a DVD to my class.  On the computer screen it was great.  But when hooked up to a projector (or even other monitor) it gave a copyright error and shut down.  The computer is running XP BUT IT IS NOT AN XP ISSUE.  It is a Lenovo issue after I did a little searching on the web.  This is a major complaint that they will have to fix.The only way around this is to extend the computer to two screens, reconfigure the size and I have other issues from that.  Ergo there are better options out there for the price.On the positive side the battery life is tremendous.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "NEVER AGAIN! :(", "Author": "Ellen Morgan", "ReviewID": "R287KJHFJR0SKP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've always had an IBM ThinkPad...my last purchase I was surprised to learn that Lenovo took over...because I've never been as happy with any other computer (tried an Apple once and a Dell...always went back to a ThinkPad), I bought this one. I couldn't be more disappointed. The quality, integrity and design points are so inferior to what I have grown used to. It's only been 2 years and I need another computer (the jack, sound card has gone bad and the motor(?) is clicking. Found out I'd have to replace the motherboard because of the jack.

Its now slow, wont restart, and or shutdown. And Lenovo made me pay $200 plus $30 for shipping to send it back for them to fix it.

A standard core 2 duo will usually sell for around 500-600 dollars mostly dependent on brand and features.  for the price they want for this pc you could easily buy a i5 computer or higher. so all in all though i do not own this computer it has obvious issues such as price, OS, and lack of features i mean come on 250GB hd and 2 GB of ram are you kidding me", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002SG7LWY"}}
