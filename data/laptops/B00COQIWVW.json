I rated it 4 but its more of a 3.5Pros:Speed. Ram and processor live up to expectations. Windows 8 running super good, and even though im not a big fan of the OS, Im learning to deal with it. CAnt imagine what itd be like running 16gb, which it can be upgraded to.Storage. Almost a TB storage. Need I say more?Aesthetics. It looks pretty.Cons:Touchpad can be weird sometimes. It might be I have to tweak the sttings but it just doenst feel right at times.Screen could use a bit more detail, clarity...resolution? DOnt know what the term is here. DEfinitely not the sharpest or clearest screen in the marketUSB ports. With only 2 ports, I find myself wanting at least one more.So for the price? great buy, but dont expect the fanciest of laptops.

With 8GB of RAM, a nice I5 processor and decent sized hard drive, this is a great computer for the average user; home use, college students. My only complaint is Windows 8, but that has nothing to do with ASUS.  I've always had ASUS computers, they are built to last and are consistently rated high for the longevity of their components.

I bought the laptop in August 2013. The hinge broke and because it is molded to the LCD, ASUS is expecting me to pay $165 as well as shipping ($30.00) for the repair. ASUS will not stand by its warranty even though the hinge initially broke after my owning it only 2 weeks. I have never written a negative review before. However, my frustration with ASUS is extremely high. Repeated emails from a local computer repair man, who is officially sanctioned by ASUS for repairs, have not resulted in anything.

Adams \"AA\"", "ReviewID": "R13BLLVMLS4JEH", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this laptop for our son for school in early August after researching several brands and my own experience with an Asus tablet. Unfortunately, this laptop has been a disappointment.  He's had problems with it freezing/becoming unresponsive to the point that the only way to get it working again is to do a hard reboot. After a few months, he began having problems with it sensing our wireless connection and connecting to the Internet (3 other laptops in the house connect without a problem.) After several hours \"chatting\" online with Asus tech support, we returned it to the manufacturer (shipping at our expense.) Repairs were supposedly made and we received it back a few days ago. Fired it up to reload everything.....and it froze....three times, requiring a hard reboot to get any type of response. Finally got everything back on (Office/Security/Pro, none of which should affect Intenet connectivity.) Once again, it will not sense the wireless connection nor connect to the Internet.Between the problems freezing the and Internet problems, it's been more trouble than it's worth and more than likely, will be the last Asus product I purchase.", "Date": "January 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great overall laptop.", "Author": "Bobby Hafler", "ReviewID": "RCX1IORR0NQJW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is fantastic. The i5 proccessor is very quick, and the 8GB of RAM(upgradable to 16) is really nice for Windows 8.1. The screen looks really great also, with a matte finish to eliminate glare. The only downside, which almost isn't even worth mentioning, is the trackpad has a feature called \"palmcheck\" or \"palmtracker\". What this does is it stops you from accidentally clicking when you don't want to. Initially this seemed like a cool feature, but it's kind of annoying. When you're navigating, or playing games it could get in your way because when you press a key, the trackpad right and left click are disabled for roughly a second. This is easily combatable, you can buy a cheap little $10 USB mouse and your problem's gone.

As an aside ASUS absolutely honors their no questions asked 12 month warranty - I used it on the last one and it was painless. That's what earned this purchase when it came time to replace the laptop (I killed it - got wet).Overall the speed is what was expected, everything works as expected. That's the good.The bad:1) I HATE Windows 8, but that's not their fault.2) The touchpad is a PAIN and as far as I can tell there is no longer a way to change it's settings . . . grrrrr!!!!3) I thought only two usb ports would be good enough . . . I was wrong! Be careful of the hub you use, I bought one from walmart that didn't last 24 hours . . . again this is not ASUS's fault, but should be noted.4) The audio is absolutely NOT accurate!! I do voice over and that is what I bought this computer for. In listening back my recording sounded too bad to be acceptable and I got scared, only to find out that it's the audio coming through the jack, using my interface I heard the audio as it was recorded which was fine. Hence, if audio quality is important to you DO NOT use this laptop for that! I am not forced to use my audio interface even for my preliminary editting/QC checks. This IS ASUS's fault and frustrates me. The last one didn't have this problem.All in all, I paid about the same as I did for my last ASUS laptop, but got an inferior product to the last one.
