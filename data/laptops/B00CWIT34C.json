With this price, it's hard to find a better laptop. Other 300 dollars laptops have cheap plastic look and touch, this one has a hi-end laptop's feel and touch.Some reviewers said this laptop keeps frozen on them. I think it might be because of the win8's windows update running on the background. Win8 has about 80 updates need to be installed and win8 does it with a scheduler so if you don't change the windows update setting, it might start doing it while you are using the laptop. When I received mine, I first changed windows update to do it manually and I did the update right away. It took almost 2 hours to finish all 80 updates. It has been 2 months now and I have never experienced any problems.Win8 is not really useful without a touch screen, so I just downloaded freeware to make win8 looks like win7 (basically the Start button). This laptop is designed to use with Win8, so you will need to get used to the touch pad. It doesn't have two separate buttons for right click and left click, one has to click the left lower side of touch pad for left click.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Such a good laptop for the money.", "Author": "Anthony", "ReviewID": "RQ9HR629DNL75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for school starting in Spring for me about a month ago and I bought it from Tech Cell Corporation here on Amazon and only had to pay $400 after tax for it new. I love everything about it and I have not found anything that I do not like. The screen is the perfect size for writing papers and my hand comfortably sits while typing my notes or papers, or even to just use the internet. The i3 processor is more than enough to do anything besides high performance gaming. This is the ideal laptop for students and for anyone looking for a computer to browse the internet with.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Never again.", "Author": "jerriann2410", "ReviewID": "R2CRPKUHU9QAJS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I chose this rating because it just overall sucked. The look of the computer is nice. It is VERY light. But right out of the box kept messing up on me. Kept freezing up. I have spent more time on this computer in a frozen state than doing anything else. I placed my order on Sept 11 and received it on Sept 13th.The first day I had it I charged it for the recommended 3 hours without turning it on until after that time. 30 minutes of having it on it was already freezing when I was searching yahoo news articles. It freezes up super quick if you have multiple windows open. Sometimes even when you only have one up. I was complaining about it on Facebook the first day of having it when a couple of my friends told me their windows 8 computers do it too and they all have different brands, so it might have been an okay computer if it did not have windows 8 on it. Windows 8 should seriously only be on touchscreen computers.I tried to give it time to see if it would get better but I have had to manually restart it 4 times in the past 2 hours due to it being frozen for 15 or more minutes. It started telling me I could not get online the last time I had to reboot it so I tried a open system restore only to sit here and wait 10 minutes for it to tell me it failed. But then it started acting normally again. I am so done with this computer and going to pursue an option to send it back. I will not get another windows 8 computer!!! It freezes too much!! I would not recommend it to even my worst enemy unless they took windows 8 out of it and replaced with windows 7. Then I might reconsider.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great!", "Author": "peter falamarin", "ReviewID": "R6SCMP0SMUHOE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased it for my nephew and so far he had no problem using it so far so good !", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great and beats an i3!", "Author": "Vaulued Customer", "ReviewID": "R1EWAHZZKSAA6O", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It says dual core but this machine is actually faster than an i3 with Windows 8 in my opinion.

Love these Laptops. Fast, cool, efficient, reliable, very stylish & built by a company who really cares about its Customers (even after my first year of Warranty was up with Laptop #1, their Customer Service still gave me free phone assistance without charging me, unlike many other companies I know out there). After studying specs, features, speed, capacity, etc., I consider these lower-cost Asus Laptops to be the very best Laptops out there under $400. One gripe is the company I bought this through Amazon shipped it to me with the actual box the Laptop was in (another box was put over this original one) was SMASHED on one side ! Didn't hurt the computer thank God, however there was no plastic cover protecting the Laptop, unlike my first Asus I got in 2012, which had a sealed plastic cover over it. This clearly indicates my second one had been previously opened & returned. Another tell-tale sign was the various SMUDGES on the cover - wasn't very happy about this. Would like to talk to the company I bought it from about this (I give them only a \"HALF-STAR\", just like the \"HALF-ASSED\" way they packed shipped my computer - also with absolutely NO padding within), but still not sure how to reach them with my complaint. Also, although completely sealed, the Battery housing was WARPED on one side, making it hard to install it on my Laptop & doesn't have a \"Smooth-Looking Fit\" on that one side underneath my computer, but I was pressed for time in needing a 2nd Laptop & just went ahead & went for it. All in all - I love my Asus Laptops, love Windows 7, Love the Asus company..... and HATE Windows 8 !!!
