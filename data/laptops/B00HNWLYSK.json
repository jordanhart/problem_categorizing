{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good laptop, fast enough except for some gaming, nice screen except for viewing angle, Windows 8 is not user-friendly", "Author": "B. Wilson", "ReviewID": "R2Y42GQ4WWBMB0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Asus is the third highest rated manufacturer of laptops (behind Apple and Lenovo) according to LaptopMag.  This is the Asus D550CA-RS31 X-Series model notebook.  It's a good laptop for the most part.  The screen has a sharp picture and the colors look good, but there are some disappointments.  It was fast enough for general use but it's not a gaming machine.  The speakers were OK but not excellent.  Windows 8 is installed, so plan on spending some time to get the free upgrade to 8.1 and then the 8.1 Update (because Microsoft has announced it will no longer support Windows 8.1 - see the Comment below).SPECS:*  The CPU is the Intel Core i3 3217U 1.8GHz, which is a 64-bit, dual-core CPU that rates 6.2 out of 10 (10 is highest) on the CPUBoss ratings.  With hyperthreading this CPU can run 4 threads, but turboboost is not supported.  Core i3 is not as fast as some other laptops with Core i5 or Core i7 but is faster than  some other laptops with the Intel Celeron CPUs.* Intel HD 4000 graphics. PC Magazine said the Intel HD Graphics 4000 will let you play 3D games at low to moderate settings, depending on the game.* 6GB DDR3 memory, expandable to 8GB.* 500GB hard drive (5400 rpm) made by HGST, a Western Digital company.* 15.6\" high-definition display with 1366 x 768 resolution.* Multiformat DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW drive with double-layer support.* HDMI out for connecting to an HDTV or other devices.* VGA D-sub port for connecting to an external monitor* 2 USB ports, one is 2.0, one if 3.0* Chicklet style keyboardWhat's in the box:  The notebook (black), charging cord, abbreviated user manual, and warranty card.Performance:  The Windows Experience Index shows the following scores: CPU processor 6.3, Memory (RAM) 7.2, Graphics 4.7, Gaming graphics 6.3, and Hard Disk 5.9.  I opened a number of programs, was playing a Youtube video and a DVD and downloading some files, then opened Word and started typing.  Word responded well, so there did not seem to be any slow down from all of those programs running simultaneously.Boot up time: Boots to the log-in screen in 17 seconds.Speakers: Sound quality was OK but not excellent when I played a DVD using the Asus software.Software:  Includes AsusDVD by Cyberlink for playing DVD's as Windows 8 no longer has a feature to play DVD movies.  Has a number of Windows 8 apps installed (some of which you may not want).PROS:* The screen has a really good picture and color, but also see the Cons below.* 6 GB of memory will help keep programs running fast and is more than a number of other entry laptops with only 4 GB* Fast enough for office work, emails, surfing the web, and some gaming* The touchpad was very nice and supports gestures with up to 3 fingers* Sometimes the system announces events over the speakers, like when updates are completed* HDMI port to connect to a TV* VGA port to connect to an external monitorCONS:* Viewing angle of the screen is not wide.  When watching a DVD I'm guessing the viewing angle is about 80 degrees (out of 180).* Some glare on the screen* Only 2 USB ports (although one is USB 3.0)* Chicklet style keyboard; some of the keys are less than full size.* Windows 8.  The upgrade to Windows 8.1 is free and then you still need the Windows 8.1 Update.  I probably spent 7 hours installing all of the updates and 8.1 upgrade and 8.1 Update.  I don't know if all those updates to 8 were needed since 8.1 was available.  After some of the updates were installed I went into the Windows Store and clicked on the Windows 8.1 upgrade about 10 times, but nothing happened.  No new window opened, no error message told me that certain other updates were still required, it did nothing.  So the stupid Windows Update wanted all of the 83 updates.  And my internet connection isn't that slow, it's about 12 Mbps.Other thoughts:  Windows 8 sucks as in this \"Jekyll-and-Hyde monstrosity\" Microsoft threw desktop and laptop users under the bus in order to place the highest emphasis on phones and tablets in one convoluted operating system.  It is not user friendly on a PC. Windows 8 was called a disaster by some experts and Windows 8.1 has been called \"slightly less terrible\" as it did not fix many user complaints. The Windows 8 learning curve has been described as steep.  Just as one example, Windows 8 and 8.1 have a hidden Start button, but it doesn't do anything except take you to the metro or modern screen with the colored tiles.  I would recommend the free utility Classic Shell to bring back a real Start button with a Start menu like Windows 7 (or XP).  Maybe Windows 9 will be better.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HNWLYSK"}}
