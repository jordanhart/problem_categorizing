{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Wish I had gotten a better low-price model", "Author": "Will Riddle \"and Jaime Riddle\"", "ReviewID": "R3MMKSB8BRF633", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If, like me, you're a normal person (i.e. NOT a techie) wanting to get the real deal on a low price laptop, this is it.Before Christmas, I read several dozen reviews before purchasing this laptop.  The main thing for me was the price, since none of my laptops have lasted more than 3 years, and my last one (Dell-500.00) only lasted 2yrs.  So I was very tempted to buy this ASUS, as it was advertised for $325 around the holidays.  I didn't really see very consistent complaints on the various websites I looked at (Best Buy, etc), so took the plunge but now wish that I hadn't.IT's not that this laptop is terrible.  It's not.  And it certainly has all the features I really needed: Windows 7, webcam, ok speakers, and good screen size.  It also is very light--a real plus.  It has good battery life so far, doesn't get hot, and doesn't have the annoying keyboard panel that is so common these days (the side panel with the extra set of numbers on it). From a list of externals, the computer fits the bill.FYI, it does NOT have an internal CD/DVD drive.also FYI, the speakers are on the bottom of the computer (where your legs hit), which is not a dealbreaker but weird.  Ok volume but makes it kind of muted.The big down side is the touchpad.  It's a dealbreaker.  A lot of people complained about odd things concerning the touchpad, like the sensitivity, but that kind of thing is fixable if you know what menu you're looking for.  What is not fixable is the actual design of the touchpad.  Firstly, the right and left click buttons are not raised or separated from the touchpad itself; nor are they distinguished from one another.  There is just a line painted on the pad that divides right from left.  This means that it is very awkward to click, select, and drag.  It's very easy to delete a whole selection you're highlighting, or right click when you mean to left click.  Many times I touch/click and nothing happens at all.  So far, after a month, my fingers have still not adjusted to this new set up--and I am having a hard time selecting/dragging, etc, accurately and quickly. It seems like maybe something under the pad does not have the right design/sensitivity because I have never struggled with this kind of thing before, not even on those computers which have the raised dot touchpad in the center of the keyboard.  This one is just OFF in a funny way.Also, it seems like the touchpad is located rather left of center.  So if you're left-handed, this may be the touchpad for you.  But if you are right handed like me, your right hand has to stretch quite a ways over to click/select.This is definitely the most annoying feature for me, enough to make me wish I had tried it out in the store first.  But I also have had some trouble with audio-visual speed/internet speed/printing speed which may or may not be related to the computer--but I sure didn't have trouble with my previous laptop, nor does anyone else experience it on our other house computers.  I think it might be a memory/RAM problem because I cannot watch Netflix (or listen to iTunes) and print/surf at the same time.  Lots of delays which, like I said, might be a problem with something else but I wouldn't take the chance.So, if you're on the fence about this machine like I was, and not able to really interpret other reviews to make a good decision, don't take the plunge just to save the money.  Maybe try the cheap Toshiba, which is also around $300, and, while heavy, cumbersome, and ugly, didn't have any of these problems.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop for Business", "Author": "Sonny Avery \"tekkidd\"", "ReviewID": "R47NUO6N2NA18", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for work and after several months of owning it here are my impressions of it.In terms of external features, this laptop seems to offer a good bit, sporting an HDMI and VGA port, USB 3.0 port, multitouch track pad and a Webcam. Overall, the features are very good for the price you pay for it.Internal's on this laptop are on par with other budget laptops. Intel Pentium processor, 2-4GB of RAM and Intel integrated graphics wont hold up running AutoCAD or Photoshop very well but handle essential business apps like Outlook, Word and internet browsing just fine. Some apps like VLC can take up to 20 seconds to load but after loading, they run without issue.Overall construction isn't the best ive ever seen but its certainly not the worst. Laptop manufacturers these days have moved away from making laptops out of tough matte casing that lasts for years to shiny casing that looks good in-store but holds up poorly in day-to-day use. The casing on this laptop skips the gloss but still attracts some fingerprints and the screen is also glossy though a screen protector should fix that. Overall I've found the casing to be better than other budget laptops but still nothing compared to the casing found on proper business laptops (think Dell Precision and HP EliteBook). However you get what you pay for and for the money its not that bad.The laptop ships with Windows 7 Home Premium and there isn't too much to be said here in terms of features. The laptop is slowed somewhat by bloatware and the 64bit flavor of Windows 7. However if you're willing to get your hands dirty, re-installing Windows in the 32bit flavor and leaving out the bloatware should speed things up considerably.Overall you get what you pay for. For the money this laptop is one of the best deals on the market and with a few tweaks on the software side, this laptop will be a perfect companion for basic computing tasks.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Awesome piece of equipment", "Author": "quality shopper", "ReviewID": "R3PR28BKVCHYG1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this lap top.

Since you cannot access the bios to install the USB, I spent $125 on a tech who spent hours on the phone with ASUS who also did not understand how to access the bios.  Somehow, between the 2 of them and my money they got the computer to boot to the USB. Several weeks later I could not access the internet, but as the computer was still working with the USB, I relegated it to nothing but a vehicle for my USB.  Then I began getting warnings about unplugging the USB prior to the entire system shutting down.  When I turned on computer I could only get the bios and it was not working properly.  Four hours on the phone with ASUS support got me nowhere. The usual \"remove the battery, count to 30, stand on your head rigamarole.

So far it has been a great value. We've had zero issues with it & once we did the Windows 7 updates & removed some of the bloat ware on it, it has operated flawlessly. My daughter uses it to play MineCraft mostly & there is no lag at all when playing. It has no issues connecting to the internet & has a strong wireless connection even though her room is some distance from our router. The keyboard has a good feel & the laptop is super light weight, so very portable.  She loves it.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is no optical drive & a back lit keyboard would have been nice.

Right out of the box, it had problems. The worst part of this notebook is the input. The spacebar barely works unless you press it firmly in the dead center. The touchpad is extremely over-sensitive, constantly clicks on its own (like if the palm of your hand touches the pad while typing, it'll click), and regularly does things I don't want it to do, like randomly clicking links in web pages as the cursor passes over them. The Ethernet port has a small hinge-like piece on the bottom that allows it to be more compact when not being used. Unfortunately, it usually gets stuck and it takes two hands to disconnect the ethernet cable.On the bright side, it does work, despite being loaded with bloatware and being insanely slow when you first set it up. For some reason the 320GB Hard Drive is partitioned into two 160GB partitions, one of which is blank. I give this 2 stars instead of 1 because it does work and has good battery life and decent specs, but it's obviously a cheaply-built laptop.
