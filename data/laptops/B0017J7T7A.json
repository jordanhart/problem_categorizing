{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing machine", "Author": "Smart Little Magpie", "ReviewID": "R11A3T2ESFND8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop.That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as \"right-click,\" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) \"about a minute\" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.  It's arguable whether I really did, but for better or worse, I'm glad I shelled out.I bought my Mac and AppleCare through Amazon and had no problems, avoided sales tax, and got a good cash-back rebate.", "Date": "December 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing Machine", "Author": "Chad", "ReviewID": "R1AD6CJ7U2YHTD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is amazing in every way. Maybe because I am coming from PC's. But I will never go back. It performs tasks with ease. I am not sure why people are complaining about the glossy screen. It looks great. I had a Dell, and that was a bad glossy screen. If the screen is a problem then buy a screen cover that go on like screen protectors that get rid of any glare.", "Date": "December 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hope you like looking at your reflection!", "Author": "M. Pellegrini \"Troy\"", "ReviewID": "R3TRH8VTZFEWQ0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic machine. Sure, glossy screens aren't ideal for everyone (anyone near any light), but this computer is magnificent.It's as speedy as you could want in a portable, along with being thin, light, and beautiful to look at (in my opinion).It handles Photoshop like a champ, as well as Final Cut Studio 2, and even ran Crysis at mostly high settings in XP Pro (had to drop the shadows a little to get 30-45 FPS average).If you're in the market for a mac, this is a great machine. If you're looking to do any sort of photo work with it you already know that you should reallly have it in a setting where you can control the light.", "Date": "October 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "C. Johnson", "ReviewID": "R3CNKDU9J0OQ3S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the most awesome laptop I've owned yet. Amazon got it to me fast and its been working great for weeks.  Wouldn't want any other laptop, at least for a few more years.  I actually use the 2 GPU option more than I thought I would, I can pull 4 or 5 hours of battery life when I have it set to use the Geforce 9400 (Better Battery Life option), and get much better video performance when I switch it over to use the Geforce 9600 (better graphics performance option).  Can't go wrong with this thing, but remeber by default its set to use the lower end video.  I also love how this laptop is so small and thin, much smaller next to most 15\" laptops I've set it next too, including an older Dell I have.  The glass touchpad is also totally awesome (and I normally hate touch pads), I wish they'd make an external USB one that I could use on other computers, beats any other type of mouse I have ever used in the last 20 years, its basically the same tech as used with an iphone and ipod touch.I did find a bug, others have complained about on some boards, sometimes after using Sleep mode a lot, the fans will not get faster as the laptop gets hotter, which can lead to overheating and damage.  When using the high end video, which is when it mainly gets too hot, I always reset the SMC first, so the fans will work right.  You do this by turning the machine off, holding down the Shift, Control, and Option keys on the LEFT side of the keyboard, then pushing the power button, you can then let that all up, and then turn on the machine and the fans work fine until sleep is used again.  I expect sometime or another Apple will have a firmware update to make the SMC controlling the fans more reliable.  You can also download a free program called SMCfancontrol, where you can manually control your fans to make them spin faster for heat purposes if needed... but I've never even needed to worry about it when its using the low end 9400M video.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Made me into an Apple Convert from Windows", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R3L7OKJPVR55VJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this notebook to replace my pre-existing Windows XP based laptop.  Whenever I watched a movie and saw a celebrity working on a computer, it was always on a Mac.  When you buy a notebook like this, you are buying a Hollywood Superstar.  I debated between the Macbook and Macbook Pro but the Pro only weighs 0.1 lb more.  The Macbook Air does not have an optical drive so I could not see using that in the practical sense for travel (even though I infrequently use an optical drive beyond installation).WHAT IS IN THE BOXNotebookInstructionsAC AdapterSETUPWhen you turn on the notebook, there is an initialization process to register your notebook and allow you to password protect the computer.  Right out of the box, the Macbook Pro works well.  It is accompanied by iLife and iTunes.  I initially updated iTunes and updated the operating system after placing my information to work wirelessly.OperationFrom initial start up, I can access my desktop in about 40 seconds.  Shutdown is less than 10 seconds.  Sleep function turns on in less than 5 seconds and it goes to sleep in that period, too.  Forced quit shuts a window of a program that is not responding.The notebook is so easy to operate.  As a Windows operator since the Windows 1.0 inception, it was not a steep learning curve.  In lieu of the Control button, you push the Command button.The touchpad is generous and the various mouse gestures are a welcome addition.  The keyboard is full-sized and buttons are extremely comfortable.  The keyboard is very quiet but the space bar is ever so islightly noiser than the rest.The hard drive is quiet.  There is no screen flex or wrist pad flex, either.  The function keys control contrast, volume and screen brightness.  Being used to a Dell Latitude D620, I am used to about a 50% brightness.  Configured with a 320 GB hard drive that is a lot of space to store my 120 GB of music and over 100 GB of photos/videos.  The hard drive appears to run fast at 5400 RPM (for what I do a 7200 RPM HD was not worth it).I do not game but I wanted the option given the video capabilities.  However, to conserve energy I use the integrated memmory card.  If I decide one day to play video games, this notebook will afford me that ability.Installation of programs have never been easier for me on a Mac than my previous 5 generations of Windows based notebooks (ranging from Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq).  I was able to install my printer software and drivers in 1/3 of the time of XP and 1/5 of the time from Vista.  Password protecting the notebook, ensured that only I would be able to install ANYTHING onto my notebook.  It is so frustrating when someone uses your computer only to find junky software installed into your notebook which add spyware and run your computer less efficiently.ConstructionThe solid construction by the aluminum body is elegant and durable.  The glass screen is highly reflective but at the angle by which I operate the notebook, I find no problems.  It is so easy to wipe off.  I have read that viewing angles were limited but I don't find that to be the case for me (with regular positioning and use).For the size of a widescreen 15.4\" notebook, this design is thin and lightweight (5.5 lbs) which matches the weight of many notebooks at the 14.1\" size of Windows based notebooks.I use this notebook on a table or my lap.  It does not get hot like prior generations of Macbook Pros which got very uncomfortably hot.The plug attaches by a magnetic type interface which is easy to use and more durable than other notebook interfaces that tend to dislodge from regular use (My old Gateway and an older model Compaq).There are 2 USB ports, a Firewire 800 port, earphone and microphone jacks, and a monitor port.  A slot for the optical drive is convenient and is software/hardware driven.  It is relatively quiet for its operation.  I do not even hear the cooling fan when it runs.Integrated webcam with very good field of view and resolution for its size.  Using the camera it is easy to do videoconferencing or video chatting (iChat).  The video chat also works with Google's Chat interface.BatteriesThe battery is unlike the batteries of its predecessors.  I ordered the older battery and obviously, it would not fit.Battery life is decent with WIFI and Bluetooth inactivated and brightness set to lower levels, allowing me about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I love how you can display batter life as a percentage or absolute time.Wifi and Bluetooth activation are easy to operate (at the upper right hand corner of the screen).  I can log in quickly from anywhere.  I just click on the Wireless icon at the top right hand corner to see what networks are available and I am online.  It was not so simple with Windows.ProgramsArmed with the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) and iLife '08 (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand), you can do a lot with the notebook right out of the box.  I did purchase extra software for more versatility:Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Special Media EditionFinal Cut Express 4Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)I had Windows XP before and syncing the IPOD with that system was well, buggy.  With the Macbook Pro, as soon as I turned on the notebook, the updates ran seamlessly and did not affect the performance of the machine.  I also decided to sync my notebook with the Macbook Pro which was very easy and I had not one error.  I also found it faster to sync with my IPOD when compared to my Windows based predecessor.  Overall, it was a more positive experience for me.The Dashboard has useful applets with more to download from the Apple web site.  Things like movie theater times, snowfall repots, conversions, weather, a dictionary, thesaurus, and calendar (just to name a few) that don't require the browser but may need internet access.  The Widgets are very useful.My favorite is the 'movie theater times' since I just activate Dashboard, I can check the theater and movie and I am done in less than a minute (it is like a virtual newspaper).Spaces is a great feature for me.  It allows me to switch to different windows to see what program is running without clutter.  It is like having a four foot screen with all of the windows.PROSLightweight for the size of the screenThin profileNext generation trackpad (works similar to an iPhone/IPOD TouchEase of operation and installation of programsGood base of programs installedVirtually no BLOATWARESimplicity of designCan run windowsDual video card configurationSpacesCONSCostAverage battery lifeNo matte screen optionI also added the Applecare Protection Plan (3 year duration) which I was advised will be worth the price for technical support and repairs (if necessary).  I highly recommend getting the Protection Plan:AppleCare Protection Plan MA515LL/A for MacBook Pro (w/ or w/o display)One peripheral that I thought was very useful was the Apple Remote which I found new on the Amazon Marketplace for $5:Apple Remote Control for iPod (White)ConclusionOverall, this is a solid notebook with the capabilities to run Windows (but why?).  The design is simple and easy to use.It has made an Apple convert out of me, out of all of these years (23 years - am I that old?) of PC computing from the IBM AT/XT days (monochrome screens, 5 inch floppy drives, 2400 baud modems, noisy dot matrix printers and clicky keyboards).I highly recommend this product.  It made an Apple Mac OS X convert out of me!", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Still a pretty decent computer for some, but a MAJOR downgrade from previous generation.  No longer for creative Professionals", "Author": "Nick \"CellGeek\"", "ReviewID": "R1YV1AYHEWP7TH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Good computer, but a major disappointment as it is downgraded in MANY ways from the previous model.  No longer useful for Art, Photography, Video professionals.  I have owned every upgrade to the Powerbook/Macbook Pro line for 9 years.  EVERY single one!  This is the first I had to return :(First the good-Very solid chassis, even more so than before.-some of the benefits the previous generation had-easier access to the hard drive for upgrade-Improved Vid card-Laptop that runs OSX, still the best operating system in use today!The Bad (compared to the previous generation)-Thinner by a hair, but wider and deeper yet a SMALLER battery?  Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean \"for professionals\"  this is definitely not the case anymore.  No button on the trackpad \"neato\" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.  I would grab the absolute best of that generation, as it may be the last great model.", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "So much to say...", "Author": "Scott D. Espenschied \"ScoDal\"", "ReviewID": "R2VGRT0I45JFMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All my life I have been a Windows & Linux user... using PC's to do everything I need to do. I needed to get an Apple computer so I could develop Apple Apps for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. So, I did lots of research to find the best bang for the buck thinking the only thing I need this device for is to just to make these apps at work. I can't lie though, I knew that Xcode wouldn't be the only thing this laptop was capable of doing. So, when it arrived, I booted it up and immediately tried to familiarize myself with how it operated. I have had almost NO Apple experience in the last 10 years. From my research I learned that there were certain things that were a requirement for my Apple purchase. I MUST have a 64-bit processor to stay up with the times and with Apple phasing things out. I MUST have either Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion. This laptop came with Snow Leopard. From the reviews I read, Snow Leopard is probably the preferred OS for this machine so I think I am going to keep it on here since it's working great.So now that you know my background and primary usage a little bit I will explain to you my thoughts as a technology enthusiast.Cosmetically, I think this laptop is really beautiful. It feels well built, I really like the glowing keys, and the glossy screen has a beautiful display. I am a matte screen lover but hey what can ya do. I have a lot of matte screen laptops, can't hurt to have a glossy one too. The glossy screen certainly isn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker for using or wanting this laptop.The first hour using the laptop I was glued to Safari searching how to do this and how to do that. I was impressed with how responsive this laptop was with every command I threw at it. I think my first session on this laptop lasted around 4 hours, and in that short 4 hours I learned how to download software, mount and install software, eject the .dmg image file, clean up my storage, understand where files are installed and how they are accessed, manage my Applications, run virtual operating systems with Vmware Fusion, how to emulate windows applications with Wine, and multitask using the many different finger swipe methods available. I like very much that Snow Leopard is an Apple/Unix combo.. what I mean is I love having access to Terminal! I was scared of how quickly I was becoming addicted to the laptop. Two things I'm still not used to about Apple/Snow Leopard but realize I just have to deal with are: No print screen button & moving files is a little weird (unless you memorize the keyboard shortcut). Again, not deal breakers, but as a web designer nothing to me is more useful than the Print Screen button.All in all, this laptop runs extremely smooth, is very fun to use, looks cool when I use it, and is a powerhouse of so many options. Surf the web, create Apple apps, do video editing, do photo editing, create art, chat with friends, do it all! Do it all at the same time! This laptop won't care it'll just keep multitasking. The only time I could feel it slow down a little is when I had 3 virtual operating systems running at the same time (Windows 7, Mountain Lion, and Windows XP) but even then it kept going, it just wasn't reallllly happy that I wanted to do all that at one time hahaDo I recommend this laptop? Yes. It's definitely a pleasurable laptop to use. You will definitely get many great hours of enjoyment out of it. Personally, I still feel more comfortable doing my actual web work and code on a Windows machine, but it's a wonderful thing to have both options at my finger tips. The macbook pro is a GREAT communication device (social media, chat, etc) and internet surfer, now THAT is for sure. And that's just scratching the surface to it's full capabilities.", "Date": "December 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Anti-Apple for years", "Author": "Jon R. \"superjon027\"", "ReviewID": "RPSMOJL21NB47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was anti-apple for years.  This was mostly due to being comfortable and knowing the in's and out's of windows.  I wanted to broaden my horizons (so to speak) by learning a new operating system.  If I was going to switch to Apple, I wanted their top of the line notebook.  This has not disappointed.  I'm running Windows 7 via Fusion 2.0, and it runs seamlessly within OS X.  The trackpad (along with the incredible battery on the 17\" model) is one of its biggest selling points.  I dont think I could go back to a regular 'point and click' trackpad.  The multiple swipes and pinches are highly intuitive and I have adjusted to them easily.  The monitor is also elegant.

Much faster than what I had before, and video plays remarkably better.  If you're reading this, you're probably conversant with some of the specs and \"issues\" of the MBP, so let me give you my experience:The screen is reflective, yes, but it's also so bright that once you turn it on you  won't see your reflection. Then again, I don't have a window behind me. The positive thing about the screen is the richness of colors... Apple has talked about \"lickability\" for years, and that's what I see with this screen.The case is rock solid. No quality problems that I have seen. I did open it to upgrade the RAM, and it was a pain finding a small-enough screwdriver for the 8 screws that I had to remove. That is my only complaint. I like having a lighter laptop, and this one feels much lighter to me than the 17\" PowerBook.The first time I saw this baby I fell in love with it, but I assumed for the price that I'd end up getting the MacBook. But, I finally succumbed to the higher-quality display of the MBP. I also like the black band around the screen. It makes the screen look larger and classier, and it's easier on the eyes.The trackpad was easy to get used to. It's a work of art in itself. The keys have a little more resistance than I prefer, but they are fine.I have no problems to report as of yet.When I opened the box I felt the way I did when I opened the PowerBook: Apple makes their laptops look like jewelry store products.", "Date": "February 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "MacBook Pro", "Author": "G.

Increased usability however comes at a price.", "Author": "Seth Eliot", "ReviewID": "R1T95CISXB3TBA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This review is for the MB470LL/A (2.4GHZ CPU, 2GB Memory, 250GB Hard Drive) MacBook Pro released in late 2008.  I bought this machine for my wife who had been using Windows machines for years, but never really \"got into\" them.  I thought that Mac, known for its superior usability and user interface design might be a better choice for her.  The rest of this review is in her words.Let me begin by saying the following:  I am a non techie, first time laptop owner.  I have not owned any previous Macs, and all my previous experience is from a Windows PC.  What I wanted from a computer was a place to keep all my photos, music, stories (I enjoy writing), etc; nothing extreme, just the everyday stuff that most people probably use their computer for.  Why I wanted a laptop was because I have a little girl (9 months currently) and I wanted to be able to write from anywhere while still being able to keep an eye on her.  So please take everything I write with this info in mind.I had heard that Mac software was fairly intuitive, and being the above said non technical person, that was a big draw for me.  Macs come with iLife, which is the bundle of programs including iTunes, iPhoto, iChat, iMovie, etc. - basically all your everyday home life programs.  The only thing that the Mac did not have included that I needed was a word processing program.  To get that, I decided to go with the Microsoft office for Mac, which obviously was purchased separately.So here are my thoughts on this computer based on having lived with it for a little less than a month...The computer itself is gorgeous.  I had never really looked at laptops before, but since getting this computer, I have been comparing it to my friends' non-Mac laptops, and I am blown away by the difference in looks.  The Mac is sleeker, better designed, the trackpad is larger.  You have a camera already installed in the Mac.  For pure aesthetic pleasure, it is Mac all the way.The screen is indeed glossy.  So far, this has not bothered me, with the caveat that as of this moment, I have not taken it outside of the home, so I've been able to control the light that hits it.  Since I bought this laptop to use inside of a home, this screen works for me, but I would highly recommend that anyone who will be using this screen in multiple lighting situations go to a Mac Store and check out the screen first hand.  It could definitely be a deal breaker for some people.I love the keyboard.  For my background, I am someone who types over 100 words a minute, and has spent several years in a clerical capacity where keyboards and I were very well acquainted.  Since my biggest worry about getting a laptop was if I would like the keyboard or not, the fact that I am so happy speaks volumes.I have found that using the Mac software has been almost as good as advertised.  I have been able to get it running with very few problems, and the couple times I have been stuck, Apple has given a lot of help options.  There is a help window where you can type a question and it will give you several options to click.  Also, on the apple site there are tons of info videos and podcasts that you can watch or read to get answers to your questions.  I have yet to have a problem where one of these two options did not get me the answer to solve it.The trackpad is the big breakthrough for this new Mac.  I won't go into detail about how to use it, you can find that elsewhere.  All I will say in regards to this is that I've found it to be fairly easy to get used to these features, and now that I'm used to it, I can't imagine not using it.The speakers sound wonderful; I often play my music just from my Mac.  Obviously, I'm not trying to say these replace your home sound system, but you can comfortably play a movie without wincing about the sound quality.Not all is perfect though.  There are a few things you should be aware of, especially if this is your first Mac purchase.First, you have the `option' of purchasing a warranty.  However, considering the Mac is a closed system with not a lot of fix options outside of Apple, it really isn't an option; it's something you need to get unless you are a gambler.  So that is an automatic almost $400 more on top of the MacBook price.Speaking of MacBook prices, I probably don't have to tell you that you pay a premium for Macs.  You can get a PC Laptop with just as good (or perhaps a slight bit better) specs for about half the price., such as this example: [HP Pavilion DV7-1150US 17-Inch Laptop (2.0 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo T5800 Processor, 4 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive, DVD Drive, Vista Premium)]Another problem is if you (like I) have family and friends that have mostly PC's, it is hard to get some cross platforming things going.  For example, it has been really difficult to find a video chat program that works on both sides.  We have ultimately decided we would run Windows for Mac on this computer to solve these type of problems.  I will admit that it is nice to have this option, but once again, that is yet another start up expense you have to consider.Apple does have a tendency to nickel and dime you.  A lot of small things you would assume would be included often have to be purchased separately, and the only one who sells these things are... Apple.Also I've my machine may have a design defect.  I noticed that if I use the two prong charger (it comes with both 2 and 3 prong) I sometimes feel a slight electrical \"vibration\".  This issue has been found by others, details are on the Apple discussion board at [...] (if amazon removes the previous link from this review, simply put \"New Macbook Pro 2.53GHz (Late 2008) Vibration Palm Rest\" into google to find it).To sum it up, as of right now, I really love my Mac.  I'm incredibly happy with the way it works, and how it is so easy to use for the things I use it for.  I still get giddy every time I see it, and I love talking about it.  I will probably update this review in about a year to let you know how it's going and if I still feel this way, but right now, I can say in all honesty, if you are comfortable spending the money for it, go for the MacBook Pro.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "BEST COMPUTER", "Author": "K8 M", "ReviewID": "R2K9PAGVSOEQE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "honestly if you have enough to buy this computer but feel like saving money and going for the Dell, DONT.

Top that with no extra anti-virus s/w or subscriptions to purchase like some other OSes. I get a battery duration of about 5.5 hours, when I just browse/read. The list goes on, DiskUtility that can resize and partition without destroying data, multi-touch trackpad while reading, very small os memory footprint,  Xcode looks very promising... I found a freeware utility that will \"burn\" Audio-DVD too, along with other formats.Apple has a this approach, of exposing elegant and minimal menus on the outside to users, but as we dig deeper, are rewarded with more and more details. As you delve deeper, more details and options are available.All in all my personal opinion: If you are planning to buy this, look at the new 15inch, 2.8 Ghz configuration, it has the same 6Mb L2 cache, that's touted as the number one reason for performance increase by Intel.

I've spent hours on the phone with Apple Support and they refuse to accept the machine for repair because I cannot force it to flicker on demand and they won't acknowledge the problem as their responsibility if it is intermittent in nature.

Can't believe I ever put up with a PC laptop for so long!Would have been nice if Apple included a Firewire 800 cable or even the mini-display port-to-VGA connector for the $2000 price tag, but Apple is irritating like that.

I went through three of these unibody MBP's and wound up opting to just get a full refund. All three I owned, plus the display models in my local store had warped lids meaning, when the notebook was closed there was a noticeable gap between the lid and the bottom of the machine. When you picked up the machine you could actually feel the lid moving down.. This is unacceptable for such an expensive machine from a company that claims to pride itself on quality. One of the machines had a faulty optical drive and two felt as if there was something loose and clunking around inside the casing when I picked them up, even when they were turned off. I was lucky enough not to get one that had a loose battery cover, tons of dead pixels, or slanted keys on the keyboard. These all seem to be common issues with these new mpb's. I'm pretty disappointed in the lack of quality control.This is a beautiful machine but, if you have an apple store near you, I'd suggest buying it directly from the store so that if there is a problem you can go right back there and deal with it immediately.", "Date": "November 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Dead Pixel's are common", "Author": "John Doe", "ReviewID": "R2M0ZJ5P8GS6RD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I gave this one star mainly to bring attention to a common MBP problem.  My MBP arrived with a dead pixel(s) near the top.  It would have been such a hassle to send it back I figured I would deal with it and maybe take it to a Mac store it became bothersome.  I learned that Apple does not consider this to be \"Materially Defective\" because it is not in the main viewing area of the screen.  If you go to the Mac Blogs and other threads you will see many people with this problem.  My suggestion is to immediately see if the screen has any pixels that are either dead or stuck and return it to Amazon if you do.  Amazon will treat you better than Apple.  They will send you a shipping label and replace the MBP where as Apple will not cover the defective screen as they do not consider it a defect.

Yes, it's pretty. You can read the other reviews to hear the Apple fanboys gush. Generally, Apple products have good ideas but poor engineering.Negatives- My spacebar stopped working a few weeks into actually using this laptop. I had to pry it off so I can touch the sensor directly in order to type this review. If you look at how the keyboard was designed from the inside, it's not surprising that it has issues.- The dual-link dvi cable (after waiting for months for it to come out after being on back order) wigs out and starts displaying junk on 30\" monitors. Apple later declared retroactively that the cable will only work on Apple branded 30\" monitors. A lot of people are upset about this.- Given the size of the screen, the screen real-estate (measured in pixels) is very small. Especially sucks if your 30\" monitor is dead in the water.- The edges of the laptop are sharp.- The laptop only opens to ~130 degrees,- Runs hot.- Fan goes crazy if the bottom is covered up.- Optical drive makes noise everytime you wake the laptop.", "Date": "January 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Over priced under proforming computer.", "Author": "Deimos \".\"", "ReviewID": "R22YZ1TR7WPRHX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "OK so I have used both versions of Macbook pro and I can attest to the fact that there is no way in hell that this system is worth nearly 3000$. OS X is a so so OS, the system runs ok same as any other MAC I guess. I bought an ACER Extenza 2.2 GHZ, 4GB RAM, 320gb HD w. Vista Home Premium and it's way faster then the macbook pro. At which time I realized that the macbook pro had cost me three times as much for less performance and speed...plus no games and minimal apple only applications/software. For the price macbook pro's should be a hell of alot faster. Plus in a few years....good luck upgrading. The DVD/CD rom drive sucks because unlike my ACER or any PC/laptop it doesen't have the eject button right on the dvd drive, so if your MAC locks up (which it will) there's no way to eject the cd/dvd (yes I tried to keyboard eject button) with the mac locked up it's useless. I think all those that complain about VISTA should use a mac w. OS X and see how quick they run back to windows just to have the capatability and limitless computing options again and not be limited to only what comes from Apple. No MAC is worth the asking price, they are generally slower than any PC/Windows based Laptop I have ever compared it too and are severly limited compared to windows users. Save your money, buy a high end windows laptop and a PC together for less then what Apple wants for their Macbooks. Next off, as stated this laptop is half as fast as an ACER Extanza or Gateway T-Series with the same specs. The pro gets boiling hot when running simple apps, and even gets so hot it could damn near start a fire, it's hot enough that you can bearly stand to touch it near the battery and under the screen/keyboard. It can't run windows for crap, even with boot camp. I boot camped Windows XP and the mac pro had an extremely hard time running it, taking forever to boot up and shut down, im talking like 10 mins. That goes to show that windows based laptops (PC's) are faster and better. Little heat, top notch speed (totally smoked the macbook pro easily). A mac runs OS X duh good but can't even handle XP......sad. Mac sucks.

I tried messing around with the word wrap and stuff, but with the price of this notebook, this is not right.2.Price3.Latch on back is almost too easy to open and get to the hard drive, etc.4.Only 2 USB Ports, what are they thinking?5.No HDMI Port6.Hardly any products are made for MAC still, they are all windows only.7.Text in Safari is very hard to read just like Textedit.I've read all the reviews on the laptop and I feel that most people are just Mac Fanboys and don't give honest reviews.  I am not one sided when it comes to computers because we have apple and microsoft products and I love them both for their own reasons.  I am just disappointed with this Macbook Pro because, while the performance is pretty good, the Cons far outweigh the Pros for this notebook.  I am getting a Dell XPS 16 which has like 4 usb ports, hdmi port, backlit keyboard, leather on the casing, finger scanner, protective case, HD SCreen.  It just makes much more sense to get more quality of a product and have more things work with it.  I paid about 1300.00 for the Dell XPS 16 and I paid 1800.00 for the Macbook Pro.  While Apple makes great products, Dell's laptops feel just as nice for a much lower price.  Maybe in the future Mac will fix a few issues and more things will work with it.  Until that time, I am sticking with Windows.  PS (This is an unbiased review, so read it with confidence that you are getting honest feedback).
