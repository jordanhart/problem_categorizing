{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Laptop poor Manufacturer", "Author": "Val529", "ReviewID": "R1WWAJGMWJSH7B", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "While this model laptop does perform very well as a gaming laptop (new games require lower settings for smooth gameplay) I have had nothing but frustration in getting the laptop registered via MSI.  I have always been reluctant to buy anything from MSI as I prefer ASUS or eVGA products (motherboards, video cards), but I liked what I saw here and the price was good at $899.Do not mistake the 3 stars above for the seller or the laptops performance.  Seller gets 4 - 5 stars, only because they do not mention that the FedEx delivery will require a signature to deliver.  Buyer should be aware of that from the start.The laptop performs quite well for Star Wars: The Old Republic, Elder Scrolls Online, and a few other games.  Windows 8.1 is still not my personal choice for an OS, but it's getting difficult to find Windows 7 on laptops that would match this one in specs and price.Nope the fault for the 3 Stars falls upon MSI and the continued aggravation of their support.  Several attempts to register this laptop have all met with failure.  Registration is not required but if done support is supposed to be smoother ... yeah sure.While I would buy from the seller again, I don't think I will be buying MSI ever again.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IQ4G8U8"}}
