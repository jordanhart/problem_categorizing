The 1 TB hybrid hard drive, Intel Core i7 processor (2.4 GHz) and 16GB RAM enables this machine to run like a beast. Boot times are under 12 seconds, recovery of sleep mode is almost instant and multi tasking between various applications is a breeze as this laptop is beyond fast.The Full HD (1920x 1080) screen has a crystal clean appearance and photos and videos are of excellent quality. Having the 2GB NVIDIA Ge Force dedicated graphics makes this laptop an easy choice for gamers. The touch screen is very responsive and easy to use but be prepared to clean your display very often. The Dr Dre Beats audio speakers are not comparable to any other laptop. The sound is clear and loud. It seems the enhanced sound comes from speakers located below the laptop in addition to the top speakers. Having 4 USB ports are a blessing alongside the HDMI port for easy connection to my TV. The fingerprint reader scans my print effortlessly and WIFI connects to my router from further distances than any of my other laptops. The only minor challenge seems to be the touchpad (mouse) whereby if I happen to use two fingers at a time it either zooms in or out whatever is on the display. Otherwise the mouse is also quite responsive when you left or right click. Windows 8.1 is easier to tolerate with the touchscreen capability. This laptop overall look and feel is quality with the silky feel of the aluminium and the thin and sophisticated look and lighter weight.Definitely a great buy!!!!The extras were worth it!!!", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome, powerful notebook", "Author": "Robert D.

DV7 had all the trims but the Envy is modern, bright and lighter but loaded with the high performance you want for the next 5 years. If you are going to buy a computer, make an investment for the years to come.

It has no optical drive but I purchased one that has slot loading and doesn't need a power supply, runs off the usb 5 volts, I don't like the windows 8.1 operating system. can't seem to get used to it. It boots up very fast. somewhere around 15 seconds. Screen is very bright, however looking at it from the side doesn't seem to good. I never have to do this so thats ok. I would recommend this computer to anyone.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Almost Perfect!", "Author": "GeekKnowsall", "ReviewID": "R501M3I0CZ1I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop back in Feb '14.A few tweaks I've made that give me comparable performance to my Macbook Air:- Changed the HDD from the Hybrid drive to Samsung 840 Pro 500 GB.- Installed Stardock Start8.The Samsung 840 pro is the fastest in the market when it comes to read/write speeds, and with 'Rapid mode' turned on, this machine is a BEAST! Boot time is less than 7 seconds (i.e. boot to the desktop with all startup items loaded).Stardocs Start8 gives me the much needed, fully functional Start button like Windows 7.- The display is very bright and crisp and perfect for watching HD content off Netflix/downloaded BlueRay content.- 16 GB RAM is ample to run a virtual machine off it (if required. My job required it).- The keyboard is the one that made me take 1 point away. It sometimes acts weird and skips a letter if you type fast (i promise i am good at typing and never had this issue with any other laptop).On the other note, i like the fact that you can turn the Keyboard backlight ON or OFF at will.- Gaming wise, this laptop picks up decent load, though it's not meant for heavy gaming even though it comes with this huge-ass 2 GB card. But then again, Laptops aren't meant for playing heavy games, their purpose is the pump decent amount of power along with mobility.Other thoughts:- This laptop is heavy, actually quite heavy. (I still carry my Mac-book Air to short meetings and Dropbox stuff i need to work on later)All in all, I can easily see this laptop being my best buddy for a while, until 2-3 more years hopefully.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Slow startup", "Author": "Zhe Ma", "ReviewID": "R3RG8D4B09QY51", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "not impressive.
