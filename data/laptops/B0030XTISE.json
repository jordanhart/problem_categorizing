Taylor", "ReviewID": "R6PWH0603TR2X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used the HP Pavilion DV7 for the 17 months now.  It was purchased by my company as I would never have considered purchasing such a \"cheap\" laptop. I only preface with this bit of nerd snobbery so you can know this review is written by someone who hasn't touched a notebook under $2K for over a decade and has rather high PC performance standards:In short, this is an AMAZING steal for the price. The technical specs are superior to what you'll find in the more \"elite\" market and the performance of this PC is really impressive.  In fact, I'm leaving my company and am only on Amazon writing this review as I prepare to purchase another of these models for my personal use...PROS:I originally thought I'd only use it for work (aka spreadsheets, etc) but started using it for video watching, gaming, movie burning, etc because it was working so smoothly.  I'm a very hard PC user. I don't like to close applications and am always multi-tasking as in: several Microsoft Excel spreadsheets; a few Word documents; at least one Project file; iTunes playing in the background; Outlook running and checking mail every 15 seconds; Google Chrome open with 7 tabs; and Mozilla Firefox open with 7 more tabs. This PC has performed expertly for a year and never even paused despite my harsh use.  As in, no crashes, no hesitation to respond to a click despite aforementioned heavy (ab)use and because it's worth repeating--no crashes.CONS:The only thing I have to report, is after 17 months of solid use, I've worn the \"E\" off (key/hardware works fine) and the \"R\" is on her way out too!Although I had no issue with mine, I feel compelled to report that of the 4 PCS my company purchased, one did end up with a fried motherboard.

I thought for many years that HP was a trusted reliable brand.  I spent $1200 on this HP just to find out 13 months in that there is a motherboard issue.  This unit overheats easily (often without you being aware) and you will lose your motherboard (and your investment will be lost). The dv7 has the same overheating/motherboard problem that the other pavilion dv series exhibits.  If you buy the unit anyway (or have already purchased) watch carefully for signs of problems BEFORE the 1 year warranty expires.  Motherboard problems can present initially as odd issues such as power problem (powering off, turning off while booting up, etc).  ALWAYS use laptops on a hard surface.  In this case using a cooling surface didn't prevent the problem but often this can help you avoid issues.

Blu-ray works fine and the power of the processor is kind of equal as a Desktop Core 2 Duo @ 2.6 Ghz. Graphics runs faster, I can play some games @ 1600*900 resolution, but others that need more graphics I play them @ 1280*720, which is not an issue for me.The only problems I have is that when you render MPEG4 video the CPU heats a lot, it goes from the 60 degrees celcius to 90 degrees celcius and that is something dangerous because the CPU can only resist 100 degrees celcius.Other thing I want to mention is that the sound quality is bad if you let it at default, you need to install the audio drivers and try to adjust them with a lot of diferent combinations for a decent audio quality.And the last thing about this PC is that battery doesn't help that much. If you spend your time going through the internet, etc. the battery will last about maximum 2 and half hours, and if you play games or edit video, it will only last about 1 hour.Overall, if you want something for games and video editing this computer is fast for that but heats a lot, but if you want a computer just for navigate though the internet, this is not for you.P.S.

Edison \"ExTerminator\"", "ReviewID": "RC1GBFQI8G9ZR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Basically what happens is this laptop works amazingly for about a year, then all sorts of problems start showing up right after the warranty expires, and HP then charges you out the ass to fix. Major problem I ran into was the overheating: the vents aren't directly over the GPU or CPU, and so if there's any sort of dust build up AT ALL, or lack of a cooling pad for too long, the whole thing overheats and basically just melts itself. This obviously requires you to replace the motherboard, which HP will do for you for about $400. Second issue, which I just recently ran into EVEN AFTER GETTING THE MOBO REPLACED, is that the power connector on the motherboard is awful. If you torque the power cord while it's plugged in, it'll pop loose on the inside, and your laptop will no longer be able to receive power from an external source: meaning you have until your battery is dead to backup and save everything on your laptop.

On that end, this laptop has met all my expectations.  In fact, I find myself now using this at home just as much as I do my desktop!  When I'm on the road, I can do just about everything with this unit that I do with my desktop - business applications, internet, movie watching and \"strategy game\" applications.  I must admit however, that I do not play what one would call \"memory intensive games\" and thus cannot comment on how it handles them.  However, it is my opinion that anyone who went in expecting that a 17 inch laptop that is selling for under $800 to be a Blu-ray playing, 3D gaming \"powerhouse\" with performance and graphics equivalent to that of your home set up of an Xbox360, Blu-Ray player and a 50\" plasma TV - you're not being realistic.  This is a \"nice\" laptop and if you're a person who wants or needs a larger screen and spends most of their time surfing, photo shopping, running a small business and occasionally listening to music or watching a movie now and then - then this is a good laptop for you.  Note:  Not everything is \"perfect\" however, fingerprints are always an issue with the units glossy \"finish.\" I also find that the touchpad is too sensitive for me (even after adjustment) but that can is quickly solved with the addition of a wireless mouse.  The \"Altec Lansing\" speakers aren't anything special - but once again - it's a \"mid-range\" laptop - so what was I expecting?  I have read some reviewer complaints about \"heat\" (I always use a cooling pad anyway) and \"slowing response times,\" motherboards, etc. but I have not experienced ANY issues with this unit over the past year.  In the final analysis, I feel this is a solid, well equipped, nicely featured product and I would have no problem getting a similar unit should the need ever arise (which it will in a couple years when all the existing features have become obsolete).", "Date": "December 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not bad, i have the model a step up from this one", "Author": "W. freeman", "ReviewID": "R3LWIZCCUNQN4L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this on a wim in Walmart mainly because of the price tag, blu-ray, and the ATI Radeon 4650 this one came with. I have an Acer Desktop with an ATI Radeon 4850 and its just slighty behind it, it actually gets a windows rating of 6.6 for graphics. Oddly enough thats the same as the Nvidia GTX 260m, so i find that hard to believe so who knows if its really accurate or not. Oh well, this laptop is pretty good, great for gaming, but sub-par for everything else. I like AMD ATHLON, i repeat ATHLON processors, they are much better and a bit faster than the turion. Basically the Turion is like the Pentium Dual Core(though not quite as quick) and the Athlon would be the Core 2 Duo. That being said this has the Ultra version of the Turion which is ok, but still a little laggy when it comes to opening apps, windows and running multiple applications at once, especially when transferring data from an external hard drive. The blu-ray play looks well not that impressive, it is clear however the colors do not jump out at you like better blu ray players in say the Sony Vaios. Also they claim the screen is LED backlit, i just don't see it, i've seen a few Acers and a nice MSI computer with backlit screens that put this one to shame. The colors are just dull, and also when it comes to burning or ripping the BD-ROM drive seems to be a bit slower than an average DVD Burner, also reading discs is painfully slow. The plus is the sound, camera, sturdy build, remote, great quality keys and just an overall feel that its a solid machine. When it comes to gaming all games from around 2005 to about 2007 will run on high setting flawlessly, even Gears Of War. Now when you step up to more advanced direct x 10 games such as Far Cry 2,  Crysis(which i hate anyways), Cryostasis, and Bioshock 2, you have to crank down the resolution if you want good details. So its hit and miss, for the same price you could order an Asus with a higher end card, but with many flaws as i have experienced, or just stick to a little gaming on this machine, and use your 360 and PS3 for the rest, i do. So its a good computer plagued mostly by a sub par processor and a slow umimpressive blu-ray player, but hey at least you get one. Other than that theres not to much wrong with the computer, although it runs hot, its not blazing hot like most machines with these specs. I like upper end HP's like this one, lower ends i could live without. Then again i have an Emachines that is a great basic computer that i use more than this one.

I have tried to investigate why the cpu always seems to be bogged down, but after turning off several services related to Windows Media Player, changing the power profile, and reducing instances of constant 50-100% cpu usage it still runs slow. Right out of the box, without any software tweeking it was a dog!Speaking of Windows media, although this is billed as an \"entertainment\" PC do not try and ask it to perform any media functions. I tried to stream music from this machine to a PS3 for playback and the associated services you must turn on caused the cpu to be pegged at 100%.....even when there was no music steaming, thus rendering it useless for any other function!!I work in IT and I know that computers are not supposed to perform like this if they are engineered correctly.

It did not disappoint.After struggling with Vista 64-bit for 4 months, I finally resorted to paying someone else to reform this laptop and replacing Vista with Win-7 32-bit. I understand that 64-bit is the new norm but at the time (November 2009), 64-bit was before its time. Either there was no software, save for 32-bit, or the software was faulty. Lately, I've found my 32-bit Win-7 running at almost 100% Ram because it is using 32-bit instead of 64-bit. Wait a few months, perhaps a year, and everything will be 64-bit.Here's the pros and cons:Pros: * great speakers  * great visual experience  * fast CPUCons: * runs hot with cooling not where it should be (even with cooling pad)  * comes with clunky HP software that must be removed by IT specialist (I am an advanced user and couldn't kill it!)  * keyboard is faulty (I am used to it but it sticks near the U-O-P-Enter keys causing the cursor to jump; I am used to it by now.)  * only 4-low powered USB ports (It won't drive my 500G external drives or the cooling fan (at full power)I bought Advanced System Optimizer to deal with typical problems with Win-7.

I must switch to 64 bit soon because of the limits of running Win-7 on 32 bit. Fortunately, this laptop has 8M of RAM. Think of RAM as the amount of space on a desktop and your hard drive as a huge file cabinet. The more memory on your desktop the more files you can open at one time. 64-bit Win-7 allows you to use RAM more efficiently so 8M goes a long way. 32-bit Win-7 is not as efficient so running more than 3-4 applications starts to slow down your computer.Add one more for the positive column: the Wi-Fi capabilities.
