I felt that it was important, however, to review the product and not the vendor.  I've used the D610 professionally with great success for several years.  I was so pleased with its performance that I bought one for my personal use as well as two more for my in-laws.  I bought all three as refurbs but I knew what I was getting and the price was unbeatable at approximately $250.00 each.  If you're a wannabe geek such as I am, you can easily find all of the service literature necessary to service the D610 yourself.  I've never had to service any of the three that I bought, but I did expand the memory in all of them.  I was pleased with how easy the upgrade was, how well engineered the product is, and how clear the service literature is as well.  I bought a hard drive caddy and an additional 80GB HD to fit in the CD port, so now I have 2 bootable HDs and a ton of storage.  If forced to search for a negative, the only thing I can come up with is the click action of the pointing device.  The feel is a bit stiff and the sound is somewhat irritating.  That said, if the pointing device ever became bothersome enough a USB mouse could be purchased for a couple of bucks.  I was looking for another D610 to buy for my wife when I stumbled upon these reviews so I felt compelled to put in my two cents worth.
