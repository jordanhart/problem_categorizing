I'm no expert on it.  All I did was a few searches, and browsed a few articles.  What I gathered was that this is not what you probably think when you see SSD.  This is a hybrid drive.  You don't actively use the 8gb's of SSD.  That is nand flash used for cache.  I think they called it a hybrid drive, and what it does is attempt to learn your usage, then use the ssd cache \"optimally\".  That is, it will improve the pperformance of your system over time, as opposed to just making everything run faster right from the start.If you're intending to buy a $1300 laptop then go ahead, I'm sure it'll be amazing.  As someone who had no intention of spending that much, but still needed/wanted a 4th gen processor for battery life, a slimmer device so its not the only thing that fits in my bag (it is 15\"+ and 5lbs but that's not an issue for me), a solid build quality, a good keyboard, a touchscreen to avoid the future punishments Microsoft has in store for anyone who doesn't cooperate, and thought they should be able to get an i7 with 8gbs for under 1000....I had a lot of looking to do.  I almost convinced myself there must be some serious design flaw that would make for a subpar user experience on a daily basis.  There isn't one.If anything this machine has exceeded my expectations so far.  Obviously I can't speak to how it holds up over the next year or two, but my impression so far is that that won't be a problem, and if it is....that's my fault, not its.As I said, I looked around.  A lot.  Nothing else even came close to fitting the bill of what I was looking for.  Too many compromises in all the wrong places.  A 9 pound dell with otherwise similar specs?  No thanks.  If I wanted a desktop that's what I'd get.This isn't without compromise.  I hear the screen is sub par.  Beats me.  I don't notice it for anything I do.  I didn't buy it ton replace my TV...or tablet....or PS vita...or phone.Oh.  The rotating screen, the flex.  When I picked it I figured that would at worst be a useless gimmick.  Its actually a very nice, very usable feature.  Sure, it doesn't flip all the way to a tablet mode, but with the touchscreen its definitely useful to be able to flip it to get the keyboard out of the way.  It'll pop up a touchscreen keyboard when needed and has everything you Ned to navigate in that mode.Overall, I couldnt be more pleased.  Its exceeded my expectations and any doubts I had before have proven to be unfounded.  Highly recommend for anyone in this price range.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome for less price !!!", "Author": "Sameer R.", "ReviewID": "R399BB5RM4QZP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I baught this laptop december 1st and its really awesome laptop for really less asking price.

I love the touch screen and the rotational aspect of it though I would have preferred if it would go flat like a large tablet. Along these lines, I screen pen would have been a nice touch but not a major issue. The greatest disappointment is the lack of an internal DVD/CD reader/writer. My greatest concern right now though is the amount of heat the unit generates. I don't like the speakers on the bottom of the unit. What I most like about the unit, is the speed in which the 17 core processor operates at. Overall, the unit has a few good features but I am concerned about future problems.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bang For The Buck", "Author": "Larry L. Eveler", "ReviewID": "RHHM1NKQ5I3K9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If there something to be negative about regarding  this wonderful touch screen laptop is that you have to upgrade to Windows 8.1 and that takes a while. If you don't have cable and work off a cellular hotspot or WiFi, it will take 4G of data to download the upgrade.  Even with the upgrade, there is a learning curve with Windows 8.1 but there are several links to help educate you. These reference links are a must because nowadays computer manufacturers don't give you a printed operators manual. Other than that, my favorite feature is the touch screen. It's like the smart phone meets the laptop.", "Date": "March 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Halil Kafar", "ReviewID": "R3R3UHM2ZPUEB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy, solid, nice and does the job, I will only buy Lenovo laptops after this point, Had very bad experience with Sony.", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast and good quality", "Author": "Brian Booher", "ReviewID": "R1F8DUBE9CUBVX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop was great out of the box.

It's larger than a tablet, 15 inches rather than a scrawny 11 to 13 inches like the Yoga. But in Theater mode you have a larger than average tablet that always has an upright stand attached. Flip it over and it becomes a traditional clam shaped laptop. I use it 90% as a tablet with an upright stand. Touch screen is great. But Windows Apps are cumbersome and don't always work right. Desktop Programs always work best but are hard to operate with fat fingers. I can't imagine using Windows 8 designed for touch screen without a tablet, a touch screen PC that can fold over into a tablet or in Theatre Presentation mode. Guerrilla arm is how you would use Windows 8 on laptop that is exclusively clam shell shaped. So without either a Tablet, Lenovo Yoga and/or Lenovo Flex Windows 8 would be absolute hell. Lenovo Flex has a larger hard drive than the Yoga (due to lack of an SSD) and it's cheaper than Yoga by a third. Yoga is for rich people who want a tablet, the Flex is best laptop replacement that can best accomodate Windows 8.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super Powerful and Super Affordable", "Author": "Mark \"Mark\"", "ReviewID": "RA7U1ZMUWEO3U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this laptop to replace my old Acer, and the difference in power is palpable.  The speed is intense, the display is great, and the touch screen is a handy addition.  It's also made by the company that was rated best PC manufacturer of 2013, and the device lives up to that claim.  It's also very lightweight and sleek in design.The few negatives are so very, very, small, and by no means begin to outweigh the awesomeness of this machine.  I'm not a fan of the mouse touch pad, as the buttons take what I consider to be undue pressure.  I went ahead and bought a cheap USB mouse shortly after purchasing this laptop.  The other complaint -- which is really my own fault -- is the lack of an optical disc (CD/DVD) drive.  I didn't read the details closely enough before purchasing, so I was a bit surprised to find the computer lacking one.  Still, those are sold rather cheaply as external devices, so I may pick one of those up in the future.Overall, a great machine for a great price.
