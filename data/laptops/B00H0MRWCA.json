{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop With Super Enhancements", "Author": "Hawaii \"Hawaii\"", "ReviewID": "R24WS73C55MA1A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "\"Thank you so much for great swift shipping. I ordered a custom built Toshiba from Toshiba in November. It arrived DOA. This seller delivered a better computer, for less money in record time, and it worked right out of the box. Could not ask for more as a customer. I wish you great luck in your amazon business.I was so pleased to see your selection of Toshiba computers and how they were equipped.  I wanted Windows 7 Professional since I have heard 8 is not great.  Sort of like Vista., an Intel i7 processor, hd output, Nvidia graphics, backlit keyboard, backlit screen, and at least 500gb hard drive.  I originally also ordered a Samsung 840 professional ssd in 500 gb.  But since the manufacturer (the one from Toshiba, not this fine seller) laptop was doa, I returned the Samsung evo.I love the sleek aluminum finish, the thiness, the Harmon Kardon speakers, the SPEED and the GRAPHICS!  Much better than the custom one I ordered direct from Toshiba which did not have a Blu Ray player and only came with 8 gb of ram.  My custom laptop was $1189.99.  So this one is less money, with much better enhancements.  It arrived two days after the order was placed, unlike three weeks from China and Toshiba!I wish I could have afforded the top of your selection with two hard drives.  If you designed these, they are perfect for gaming or for someone like me who wants performance.  Hands down the best fit for the money for my pocketbook.  All of your Toshiba computers are great buys and designed with the customer in mind.  Even comes with the option of windows 8 if I choose to dare to go there.  Thanks again.I would like to update my review with the information that I was able to purchase an extended warranty on this Toshiba laptop for service years 2 and 3 and accidental damage for all 3 years from Toshiba Direct for very reasonable pricing.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop!!!!", "Author": "Byron Sanderson", "ReviewID": "R4UKKUNNJF1RR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Toshiba came packed with all the bells and whistles I was looking for, but not overloaded with all the extras I didn't.It is super fast with the i7 processor and the 12gb of ram help keep it thinking straight while multitasking.Really cool, brushed aluminum looking outer case and I LOVE the back-lit keyboard for low light situations. The 15.6\" size is quite refreshing compared to my old 17\" and the computer is very lightweight.It comes ready to go with Windows 7 Pro, which I needed for my business. However, it also comes with the upgrade disks for Windows 8 Pro if I should ever need to upgrade.As with most off the shelf PC's, it comes with a trial version of MS Office on-board, which will allow you to log on to the Microsoft website and purchase the version of your choice.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "GREAT STUFF!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RHGM10S4IIH6I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Laptop functioning great so far.  Some drawbacks, but minor enough to ignore, i.e. blue ray does not seem to output to an external monitor even when dumbing monitor output down to the laptop's max resolution of 1370 x 768 (???) or whatevers but playing blu ray on the laptop is great. I like Toshiba's update application.  Was not able to connect to the Toshiba Registration site, but that is a separate issue from the laptop itself.  Aluminum burnished chasis feels a bit weird feeling esp when I am resting my wrists on the latop using the keyboard.  Have not tried the USB 3.0 yet.  What was sorta interesting was that this was advertised as having a 500gb HDD, but when I did a systems check, it shows about a 737gb HDD (686gb shown as available total).  So I got a free 237gb upgraded HDD.  Would give this 5 but the packing not so good.  The Toshiba box was placed in an Amazon box larger, maybe about 20%, and there was no packing material inside such several of those inflated plastic air bumpers.  When I picked up the delivery from the USPS, Amazon box had some dings almost bordering on the serious and the Toshiba box also had a ding on one siide, crushed inward a bit.  But laptop seems okay and will keep working with it to make sure no issues resulting from those dings.  As it stands, excellent replacement for my old Vista box.  Aside from the questionable packing, would immediately recommend this latop to anyone wanting a 15.6\" laptop with WIN7, I7, etc.", "Date": "February 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellant", "Author": "Al Neubert", "ReviewID": "R17F09KF9FNDLK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Laptop better than advertised.

It's sleek looking with the power that you'll need for most business and video/graphic editing needs.  I'd been haunting Toshiba's website for months, looking for deals -- and they don't come close to what is offered here.Included in your package are recovery disks for Windows 8.1 Pro.  I wanted Windows 7 Pro -- which is hard to find on a new laptop these days -- but will probably upgrade at some point.Turn this machine on and you're ready to be productive.
