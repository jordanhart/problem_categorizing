This laptop works really great in terms of speed and responsiveness. The only thing that I hate is it comes with Windows 8 preloaded. I really think Windows 8 should only be installed on Windows tablet, not laptop or desktop PCs. Sound quality is at best, quality is really good with wihite glossy color. Recovery dics does not come in the package as most new laptops don't. Once you created your login and password, you can set up your own recovery discs manually which normally requires 6 DVDs.Pros:- 500 megs- 6 megs of RAM- 64 bit Windows 8.0- Intel i3 2.40 GHZ- Beats quality sound.Cons:- Battery life.- Not touch screen- Not windows 7- No recovery discs", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CPSRKHQ"}}
