{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great All-Around Windows Laptop", "Author": "Bart Codd", "ReviewID": "R2NDY9RUDP4GKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very happy with this machine.  Fast, light, solid build, good-looking, great screen, comfortable back-lit keyboard.  About identical in size and weight to a 13-inch Macbook, but with a 14\" screen.  Screen resolution is 1600 x 900, equivalent to Macbook and a step up from the 1366 x 768 standard on a lot of Windows laptops.  (Sony touts its \"full HD\" 1920 x 1080 displays, but I found it made screen objects just too small. This is a happy medium.)  It's quiet: the fan hardly ever comes on, and when it does it's not too loud.  Good battery life: 5 to 6 hours easily without even going to the \"max\" power-saving scheme.I have no real complaints, only a couple of wishes.  More USB ports -- it has one 2.0 and one 3.0 (although personally I've never needed more); a Blu-ray drive; a Core i7 option.I bought this after returning a 15.5\" Sony Vaio S-series, which had a flimsy, wobbly screen with the aforementioned \"Full HD\", an annoying off-center touchpad, and a form factor that was just too big and wide.  I'm much happier with the Samsung.One recommendation:  whichever power-management scheme you use, edit it so that the wireless card is set to \"Maximum Performance\" when unplugged -- the default slows wireless to a crawl in order to save a little juice.  (If you see Samsung dinged on forums for slow wireless, that's why, and it's an easy adjustment that completely resolves the issue.)Update 7/9/12: I'm still very happy with it. No changes to my earlier comments. Some people complain about the touchpad, it is very sensitive by default, but I lowered the sensitivity using the control panel and now it rarely misinterprets random thumb or palm touches as taps.", "Date": "March 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop!", "Author": "Garrett Kelley \"neuor\"", "ReviewID": "R2LN9IN8U9VVJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The pictures for this product are for the 15.6\" version and are NOT of the 14\" version. The 14\" version does not have the number pad on the keyboard. The 14\" has one USB 3.0 port and one USB 2.0 port on the left side. There are no USB ports on the right side.Overall I REALLY like this laptop. It is plenty fast, has a higher resolution display than most of its competitors, is very portable, and is well built. I am a big fan of matte laptop displays and Samsung does not disappoint on this device. I find the keyboard on this laptop to be easier to type on than most others I have tried, especially the Asus G51VX I am coming from. Unibody construction would be nice, but given the price point and the hardware this contains I can overlook it. The track pad is very large. If I'm not careful I can hit it with my left wrist while typing. I'm 6'2\" and have large wrists though, it may not be an issue for everyone. This isn't a big issue for me since I typically disable the track pad and use a mouse anyways. If you're in the market for a lighter, very portable, but yet powerful laptop: I highly recommend the Series 7 14\".EDIT: Amazon has updated the photos for this product. They are now correct for the 14\" version.", "Date": "February 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Everything I needed and then some...", "Author": "Bola", "ReviewID": "RE60SOI2UPQUC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having my Sony Vaio SA2 stolen I was forced into purchasing a new laptop. The things I loved about the Vaio were: dedicated graphics card, battery life, weight, hdmi output,backlit keyboard,screen resolution 1600x900, and appearance.However there were some things that I didn't like; build, materials, noisy fan, and slow hard drive speed. So sense I had to buy a new laptop I wanted to make sure to address some of the issues I had with the Vaio, but maintain the things that I did like about it as well. Thus I came across the Samsung Series 7 NP700Z3A-S06US Laptop.This Laptop addressed every single issue I had with the Vaio, its better built(screen is solid not flimsy like it was with the Vaio) has a bigger and faster hard drive(1TB, and 8gb of ssd),more ram(8gb vs 4gb on Vaio) and it maintained all the things I loved about the Vaio(speed, graphics card, backlit keyboard, screen resolution 1600x900, and size) .The only very small, almost not worth mentioning difference, between the Samsung vs the Sony, was that the Sammy cost $150 dollars more, and it weighs about 1lb over the the Sony. Either way these minimalistic differences didn't stop me from making the switch and not looking back at my Vaio SA2I also want to reinforce what the previous reviewer said, the picture that Amazon has is for the z5a and not the z3a. That being said if your looking for a well made, good looking, portable power house, BUY THIS LAPTOP!PROS:Speed - processor(dual core i5 2.5 up to 3.0ghz speed)Hard drive - 1TB and 8gb of SATA(SSD like speed)Screen - 1600x900Dedicated Graphics Card - AMD RADEON HD 6490MRAM - 8GB DDR3Build - Screen Lid is solid, brushed aluminumHDMI - If you like to watch movies, play games, and stream videos on a larger screen this is a must.Back Lit Keyboard - Helps allot in low light situations it became a must for me after experiencing it.Cons:Weight - Over 4lbs tends to be a little heavy(subjective)", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "overall very happy", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R2CN1CNE4RRTKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little bigger than other ultrabooks, but alot more powerful.PROS:- supports 8GB RAM, this was lightest laptop that I could find supporting 8GB of RAM- Very fast, CPU is better than most other ultrabooks- nice resolution.. things are small, but not too small- some newer battery technology, supposedly letting it last longer- the backlit keyboard is very nice, and the keyboard layout is easy to type withCONS:- Only 2 USB, both on left side. The USB3 seems to give me issues, might be my driver.- Battery is NOT removable (as long as the battery-life works as intended, this shouldn't be a problem).- CD-Rom is NOT removable... i really not even need an optical drive- Weight is a little heavy, it's not bad.. but could be a little lighterNOTE: If you do a clean install of windows, like i did, be sure to get the WIFI drivers from the Intel website (not from Samsung). I spend hours trying to figure out way my WIFI would not stay connected in Windows 7 64. Once I installed Intel's drivers (which claim to be an older version) it worked flawlessly.For $1K, I'm pretty happy.

Until I sent it in for repair", "Author": "ArchaeologyJunkie", "ReviewID": "R13NN9REMSCDBY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop new in July as a college graduation present from my parents. I was incredibly happy with the laptop... at first. I was excited to be able to game (play WoW at reasonable FPS for raiding and little latency; exciting for a little machine!!!). I had to laptop for just over two months and a USB port stopped working. After an over-the-phone attempt fix to see if it was a software problem, I had to mail the laptop in. I was guaranteed repair and having it hipped back in 5-7 business days. Over 3 weeks later, I finally received my laptop from the repair center complete with a damaged inner box where the repair center dropped the laptop. (There was a box packed in a box, so it couldn't have been from shipping.) Taking the computer straight out of the box, the track pad did not work properly which was not an issue I had when I sent it in. After calling Samsung they apologized about the broken track pad and the time it took to repair, but insisted they do not quote times for repair.... Okay, fine, you had one misinformed customer service rep. The agent I was dealing with them told me I needed to return the laptop again and I would \"get it back when I got it back.\" Apparently, according to this agent, Samsung policy is that the repair center gets three attempts to take their time and return the laptop to you and it's not until after the third time that they offer refunds or exchanges. With the help of Amazon, I ended up getting a full refund, but I would not have been able to by myself. I will *never* purchase nor recommend another Samsung product nor laptop to anyone, ever; You've been warned about their \"repairs,\" customer support, and faulty laptop repair policy.PS- Thank you Amazon for helping me correct the issue so I could have a college graduation laptop that brings me smiles, plenty of gaming, and isn't a Samsung.", "Date": "October 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "very nice machine", "Author": "Total Truth", "ReviewID": "R1LWM292F7VG0W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had my Samsung for two months now so I'm here to tell you about it!What I like:Screen is bright enough I usually just leave it at minimum brightness and it is sufficeThe backlit keyboard and the spacing on the keyboard as wellQuick start-upWebcam is decent-not amazing but better than my prior computerSpeakers are great-you get a lot of sound at a relatively low settingNot too heavyThe screen isn't flimsy, after I got it I had to open my old computer for something and it felt so flimsy compared to the SamsungThe machine loads fast (although for the first week after I got it I would've said differently but after some updates that was fixed)What I don't like as much:The vent-it's in the hinges where screen meets machine so it can get hot but more so on the top so as long as you have some heat tolerance and don't go sticking your hand above the vent you'll be fineIt came with Skype installed but it was the 32-bit version so I had to get rid of Skype and download it in the 64-bit version-took about 20 minutes to fix but 2 days to figure outThings to know:CD/DVD player is a slot you slide the disc into (I have no negative opinion on that)1 USB 2.0 and 1 USB 3.0 (I would have liked there to be one more, but I can settle for two)Microphone and headphone are combined into one hole for bothMouse pad has clickers built into the pad-beware, the clickers only work if you click on the fourth of the mouse pad closest to youIf you think you can't adjust something try googling it, I've learned a lot through doing so-For example the machine comes and it will change screen brightness to compensate the amount of light coming through the light sensor, but you can disable thatSome of the bloat ware like Youcam (similar to photobooth on Mac) can be very useful, others like Mediasuite I have no use for and it may pop-up when working with song files rather than iTunes (which you'll have to download if you want)Be sure to do updates!  Otherwise you'll feel like you got robbed, but it moves swiftly as soon as the updates are onOverall I have enjoyed this computer so unless I update (if I do I'll post the date I do so) I'd have to say it might be a bit overpriced (I got mine on sale though) but overall I am happy with mine.

This one fits the bill, although a blu-ray drive would have been a nice addition. I've been using it for about a month and am quite satisfied with its performance. I'm a photographer and this machine is my travel companion.  It has enough horsepower to handle Photoshop as well as video editting software (I'm not a gamer, so can't comment on how well it performs in that space).  The screen display is bright and the resolution is quite ok for my purposes. The build quality is very good.  WiFi connects everytime and stays connected.The only complaint I have, which is why 4 stars instead of 5, is with the trackpad.

You can activate silent mode and force the fan off if it really bothers you.Excellent build quality.It comes with some extra programs but they are useful and for system management so I wouldn't say it has a lot of bloatware.Start-up time is VERY quick. \"ExpressCache\" and the hybrid 8GB of RAM seem to be responsible for a big part of that.The Tiger Direct product photo (side view) mislabels the mini-VGA port as \"mini-HDMI port\". SAMSUNG provides an adapter for the mini-VGA.I think some reviews elsewhere mention problems with the track pad but I have found none.Backlit keyboard is great.

To be honest when I looked at a couple in the store I wasnt impressed at first, but after reading and comparing, I kept coming back to Samsung and Asus! I Finally decided on Samsung reason why is because you get more overall performance and looks! I mean there's just no doubt these series 7's are just sexy! And for me I really wanted a built in optical drive and something portable. This is a great middle ground between your big gamer laptops and the ultrabooks.Performance is really great for the school use and moderate applications that I use it for! This should be a great laptop for most users. Very quick start ups with the on board SSD and nice screen IMO... I love matte screens! Solid constriuction, feels very well built! Battery life has also been very good getting the 5-6 hours I expected.Now for the bad... Track pad is crap... Get a Bluetooth mouse. I find it way more convenient to use a Bluetooth mouse anyhow and would probably use one of the track pad was great, but man they really should improve this feature. It's not unusable, it just can be frustrating at times, but THIS should not be a deal breaker!  Also for this laptop only weighing 4lbs it feels pretty heavy, but still very protable don't let this scare you either.Overall I am very pleased with this laptop from Samsung. So pleased that's why I went ahead a picked up the NP700z5c with the third gen intel chip.

It has loads of hard drive space, very quick and responsive cpu, and a low to mid range graphics card that gives the laptop a small gaming edge over the competition.  Dont get me wrong its not a gaming rig, but if you occasionaly like playing a computer game or two that is not super demanding you will be good.  The laptop is very solidly build, and it is a little heavier than it looks, but not enough to take it out of the highly portable category.  The extra weight reinforces the laptop's built quality, so i have no complaints in this section.I especialy like the matte glare resistant screen and backlit keyboard, i had this laptop for two days and it completely spoiled me.  The screen helped alot against eye strain, and the backlit keyboard worked wonders for typing in low light conditions.In short, i loved this laptop but it had two downsides that convinced me to return it.  The track pad!!!  Yes, it is possible to get used to it and there are drivers out there that greatly reduce the problem but the way i type and work i absolutely need a centered trackpad with left and right buttons.  because of the design, it is easy to double click, highlight, click and right click at/on inapropriate times.  That really bothered me and even though i got better at it, and probably would be fully used to it in a week or two, i still prefer the comfort and security of a more traditional track pad.  Another thing that i did not like about the laptop was its heating system.  it got hot enough for me to be concerned about its cooling system and the laptop's longevity because of it.  Also, it got hot enough so that it would be uncomfortable to use as what it is designed to be used as;  a computer that you can put on your lap.all in all though its a well rounded great bang for buck machine.  if it had a traditional track pad i would have kept it despite the heat since it only got like that because i ran it on high settings.  i am hating myself for returning it now....  but i will keep looking around or wait for a similar samsung with all the specs this one has and a track pad more appropriate for me.at the time of my purchase i bought it used in like new condition and got just that for 730.00 dollars", "Date": "July 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just OK, not Linux friendly", "Author": "Paul", "ReviewID": "R3M2TRDH9MDEMM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "It's an OK laptop, though Samsung said it's aluminum case it is not - it's a plastic frame with thin metal layers on top, the edges where metal meets plastic are not very smooth, could be better designed for $1000 machine.It's a high res screen but with fairly poor vertical angles, many smaller fonts look washed out and barely readable. Vertical scrolling in touch-pad only works in some applications, and it's nowhere near smoothness of a Mac.Hard drive is huge but very slow, some Samsung apps take literally minutes to load while HDD indicator just never stops, for a PC with such high specs it's just embarrassing, my 5 year old Windows XP Fujitsu laptop feels faster.Another problem is Linux compatibility, touch pad misses every second touch under Linux (tried OpenSUSE and Ubunutu) even with sensitivity set to max.

The problem with the computer is that Samsung got way too cute for its own good. By that I mean, they added too many hardware and software system 'enhancements' mostly to save a little battery life that I would have happily given up to have things be simplified and work correctly. The auto dimming screen is one feature that you will have issues with. The only solution is to turn it off unless you enjoy screen flicker during the night time. They have added a layer of 'easy settings' controls that make things anything but. You set them and each restart you have to set many of them again. Fan noise level when plugged in is unacceptable and the 'Silent Mode' control that quites it down needs to be turned back on each time you reboot and you can bet Silent Mode also limits the processor's power when engaged. Wonderful, you pay beaucoup bucks for a faster processor and can't enjoy it without the annoying fan sounds that come along with it.All of this doesn't even begin to address their tech 'support.' You just KNOW you could have problems when you call the same number that people with their refrigerators do - and have five option buttons to push to get to computers. Their Level 1 tech people are at least on shore during regular business hours but their main solution to every problem is either a system restore and/or send it in for servicing - which takes three weeks and oh, you might get a refurb replacement if they can't fix yours. Nice, buy a new computer that has issues, send it in, wait three weeks and get a refurb because the technician didn't know how to fix yours over the phone. I'd be willing to bet more than half the ones sent in to them could be fixed over the phone if their tech people had a clue.The simple disconnect and bottom line here is this: Product developers who tried to make their computers better by adding things that cause problems and end up making them worse coupled with a tech support system that is laughable.
