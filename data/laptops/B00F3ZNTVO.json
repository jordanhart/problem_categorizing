I am very happy with my purchase.I could do away with win8 but I can live with it. Only downside I have with it is the preinstalled mcafee antivirus program. Can't stand it.12/27/13Okay so after having it for more than 2 weeks I've come to the conclusion that this laptop is just grand.Start up without the ssd not being in it well not as quick but darn if I can tell the difference sometimes. As I said before not to keen on win8 but I'm still working out all of its functions , So only time will tell if I truly get it. Still this mighty little machine runs the programs I throw at it and laughs.Downside really seem minimal but I'd say the non existing back lighting on the key board would help if it had it. And I'm not to sure but the screen seems to look kind of fuzzy from time to time , But that may just my vision.Overall so far it is a really decent machine for the price, But could be even better if you find it on sale.Thank You for taking the time to read my  review.

The price was great, as Costco had $150 off on this.  It was rather easy to setup and I haven't had the issues that I've read on other reviews.  My old laptop, which is 7.5 yrs old is a Sony Vaio and in it's day, it was great, though, it had heating issues.The Dell seems to not have the heating issues and as far as Windows 8, it is a lot different than the XP on my Vaio and than the Windows 7 on our other Dell laptop and a desktop we have.  We bought the touchscreen version and that just gives me another option and works well for some of the things I do.This system came with Windows 8 and after I did the 50 updates to this, I upgraded for free to Windows 8.1.  I really don't know what the difference was.  There are major differences from Windows XP and 8.  How the Start menu is completely different and I wished that I could arrange the START menu to all fit on one screen, but that's okay that it's horizontal.  It's more versatile and switching from a drop down type menu to icons is a bit different but not bad.We have an iPhone, so I got used to the touchscreen thing there and swiping.  To close down apps in Windows 8.1, you have to go from the top of the screen and swipe down to the bottom to close it.  For those other apps that have an X in the corner, you can close them down that way.How users are setup are a bit different, but it's fine.  Different isn't bad.  Though, if you don't have a hotmail account, I'm not sure how you would setup your stuff originally.  I do have to use my hotmail account to sign into my computer, which that is a pain if you don't have an account with hotmail.I didn't seem to have any issues with loading any of the programs that I regularly use.  And I had no problems installing Office 2007 Pro to it, which is what I use.  I was glad I did not have to upgrade my Office Suites.One of the things I would like to see is the ability to be able to condense the Apps page of Windows.  It's really cluttered and I don't like seeing all that clutter.  Maybe I just don't know how.It's really a nice little laptop, and I bought it primarily because my subcontracting job is requiring I upgrade to either Windows 7 or 8 Pro.  Next week I should get the Windows 8.1 Pro and I'll write a review of what happens there.  I hope I don't have to uninstall or reinstall all the programs I loaded today.Hope I continue to feel great about this little laptop, but so far, I love it.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value laptop !", "Author": "Pietro Casano", "ReviewID": "R1J6KIAT5P9GUZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for less than a week but so far it is impressive.Processor is fast and reliable.

It opens programs quickly.  It runs beautifully, even when I have multiple programs open.  This is a work computer so I'm not expecting to run games, or stream videos on it, so it's doing everything I need it to do, and well.  It handled the upgrade to 8.1 Pro flawlessly (so I could have BitLocker among other things) and the keyboard is very responsive.  I wasn't sure about the full numeric keypad at first, thinking it would feel weird \"typing to the left\", but I adjusted to it quickly enough.My only gripes are1) I miss the lit keyboard I had on my previous Dell Inspiron2) The built quality on this one doesn't feel as solid as my previous one.  It feels more \"delicate\" in several ways.  There are also times that, if I place too much weight in certain areas with my hands or fingers, it impacts how the keyboard or track pad respond.3) The one thing I don't like about the numeric keypad is how it impacted the placement of the delete, page up/down, and End keys.

I've had it for a few months and already considering investing in a new machine so I can dump my Dell.- Consistently get the blue screen of death, support has been unable to identify and resolve the issue- Initial settings were very annoying, for example the PC would automatically reboot to install minor updates.  Disrupting me at work and sometimes taking me offline for 30 minutes or more during critical work moments- Dell software is constantly trying to sell me redundant virus protection - my computer isn't your billboard, quit disrupting my business presentations with pop-up notifications trying to sell me things I don't need- Difficulty connecting to networks I know are available and in good working order- Forced to buy Windows 8, which is not appropriate for business usersMy friends that know computers strongly cautioned me against a Dell.  The price was great so I took a gamble.  I figured I only use Office and a browser...basic enough needs that any computer should be able to handle.  I was wrong, recommend you go with a different brand.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Hopeless", "Author": "aneesh", "ReviewID": "R2OO6ZHAXO2NKY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The computer is hopeless.
