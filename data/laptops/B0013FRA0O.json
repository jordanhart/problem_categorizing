{"Reviews": [{"Title": "MacBook, Perfect Size & Power", "Author": "Enzo", "ReviewID": "RNZJLAXKACKYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went back and forth between the MacBook and MacBook Pro. Which one? Will it be powerful enough? Big enough...?Maybe a Sony Vaio would be better?I'm a Windows software developer but I'm going back to school for my MBA and I wanted a smaller, simple notebook for papers and internet communication for classwork. It needs to be durable and I need it to work without a lot of fussing around with system bits.After much research I chose the MacBook over the pro because of the smaller size and the fact that the aluminum on the pro although cool, can dent easily. The matte black finish on the MacBook is elegant, tough, and the build quality it top notch. Does the the black eventually get smears on it from your hands and fingers? Yes it does but just wipe them off every so often. It's not a big deal.IMO, aside from a few points in processor speed the major technical thing the Pro gets your over the MacBook is a dedicated video card. The card in the MacBook uses part of your system memory and that's not a big deal if you aren't doing complex things like 3D Rendering or gaming. Even most photo editing tasks on the little MacBook will work well *if* you have enough RAM. I recommend 2GB or more.My MacBook arrived and I couldn't be happier. I personally think the black is nicer looking than the aluminum model. And this thing is fast! It makes my dual Intel Windows tower at work seem pokey. The glossy screen probably has more glare than a matte screen but the trade off in weight and size is well worth it.Also the built in wireless Airport is great and reception is wonderful. Just turn it on and  available networks show up in your menu. It's really so much nicer than Windows. The bonus is that I can dual boot with BootCamp and run all my Windows stuff when I need to. I installed Neo Office (open source office suite) and now I can open and create all the documents for my coursework.Don't fool yourself into thinking the less expensive MacBook is less worthy for general computing tasks than the more sophisticated pro. It's very elegant looking and very powerful. If you don't need the power and size of the pro, I think you'll be happy and the money you save can be put toward other things. Maybe a new digital camera?", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "When I Fell, I Fell Hard", "Author": "Ray \"Estudiante de la Prophecia\"", "ReviewID": "R15KQS76IPEP50", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have always been a heavy Windows user dating all the way back to the release of version 3.1 (approx 16 years ago).  I was never interested in the Mac do to what I perceived as the proprietary nature of their systems and what I thought was an expensive price tag. Here is what I discovered when I purchased this model of Mac:1.  It just works.  The boot up time is less than half of what it takes my Windows laptop, and the shut down time (4 seconds) is only a fraction of the  30-40 seconds of my Toshiba.2.  It runs Windows Vista faster than my Toshiba.  I still need to run a couple of Windows applications, so I went through the VERY easy bootcamp installation of Vista.  It runs flawlessly and after having purchased Fusion for $79, I am now able to run Windows apps alongside Mac apps.  Simply incredible.3.  Battery life is great.  I can get 4 hours out of mine running in low power mode.4.  Why no card reader????  Almost all PCs now come with card readers to use with your digital camera.  Why does Mac not include this???  :(5.  It does NOT require the regular restarts that my Windows systems have always required.  Simply close the lid and put it to sleep at night, and the next morning lift the lid and you are back in business.  I can do this with my Toshiba but start getting errors in Windows after a couple of days and need to reset.  Also, my Macbook runs very cool (with little heat) in the sleep mode, thereby allowing  me to put it in my brief case in sleep mode without it heating up.  I could never do that with any of my PC laptops.  They would always heat up.6.  No virus software needed.  Happy, Happy, Happy.  Surfing the internet is faster because of this.  Also, opening a document in MS Word is faster because the Virus software is not screening it.I purchased MS Office and loaded it.  It runs great and is almost identical to its Windows counterpart in functionality.  But, Word and Excel seem to boot up a bit slower than the Windows versions.  This is one thing that I do not like.7.  I like the way the electric cord connects with a magnet instead of plugging in.  This seems handier and better in design, but I wonder if the magnet will still be as strong two years from now?All in all, I am extremely pleased with this Mac.  When you compare the price with the included features, it is only slightly more expensive than a comparable PC.  To me it is worth the extra $200.Actually what is going to make this very expensive, is now that my wife and daughter have seen my Mac they are both wanting to replace their PCs as well.  This is one expense I did NOT budget for.Thanks for reading.  Hope this helps", "Date": "April 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fast & Cool with Outstanding Battery Life", "Author": "J.

My current HP is five years old and it was time to consider a replacement. The availability of a $1000 (with rebate) Penryn based entry level MacBook from Amazon proved irresistible to me and am glad I gave Apple a try. I understand it is not a good choice for gaming due to its lack of a dedicated graphics card.I have been using it for two weeks now and have the following observations:* Very snappy performance including boot up and shut down time* Smaller screen than I am accustomed to but not a problem due to the excellent fonts* Small size and light weight is a plus.* Excellent wireless performance.* Amazing battery life (never less than 4 hours at 90% screen brightness).* Very little heat generation.* Fan and hard drive noise is very low.* Setting up a dual boot to Windows XP is well documented and easy to do.* Running Windows creates much more heat and consequent lower battery life.* 4 MEG of RAM can be purchased for under $100 but it runs very nicely with 1 MEG* I miss the two button trackpad.* It has a relatively sharp edge where one's palm usually rests when using trackpad* Free software is available to allow reading Windows .wmv sound files.* Built in automatic backup capability (Time Machine) is a plus.* Nothing is perfect but this is pretty close given the price and current technology.For those considering a switch and willing to learn a new operating system, I highly recommend it!", "Date": "March 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Dead Pixel Marring Otherwise Great Computer/Amazon Comes Through!", "Author": "Blackout Ellie", "ReviewID": "R3E6BP2L5PN1AA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "***** - 5 Stars  (UPDATED BELOW)'Nuff said about how great this computer and Leopard are.HOWEVER, out of the box I have one DEAD PIXEL just off center which shows as a black dot the size of a small period.  According to Amazon and Apple, one dead pixel is not enough to warrant replacement of a brand new computer.  I know it's one tiny pixel out of a million but once you notice it you always seem to see it.  It just seems to me that for $1300 you should be able to receive a computer without screen imperfections.  I wouldn't care about discoloration or scratches on the case but the screen should be perfect.  I don't buy Amazon's & Apple's excuse that this is acceptable: no Mac I've ever owned had dead pixels; none of my friends' Macs have dead pixels; none I've seen in Apple stores have dead pixels etc.  Had I purchased in an Apple store I could have walked in within 30 days and they would have swapped it out.  How can everyone I know and even my giant LCD TV not have any dead pixels but my brand new macbook has a permanent dot?  On-line buyers beware.(END OF ORIGINAL REVIEW)UPDATE:  AMAZON HAS COME THROUGH WITH FLYING COLORS AND SENT ME A BRAND NEW MACBOOK WITH NO DEAD PIXELS AT NO CHARGE.  After a visit to the Apple Store (to confirm that if purchased there, they would replace it) I gave Amazon one more chance.  Using the call-back feature, customer service instantly called me and without any hassle, told me that they would replace my defective Macbook.  Sure enough, 1 day later my new Macbook arrived via FedEx and after staring intently at each and every pixel, I am completely satisfied.  This is the kind of customer service I would expect, and makes me very happy to use and recommend Amazon in the future.A few things I've learned in this process.  If you're worried about pixel issues, as soon as you get your new computer, download a Pixel Checker program or change your background to Red, Green, Blue, White, Black (separately) and check for any stuck or dead pixels.  If there is a problem and you can live with it - enjoy your new computer, otherwise contact your dealer ASAP.  Also, I had much better results dealing with the telephone support people as opposed to trying to resolve this by email.  As long as Amazon takes care of its customers like this, I will be a lifelong user.I wish I could change the star ratings to 5-star but you're not allowed to edit that.  This is really a great computer.  Super fast and perfect for my needs.  Weighs 5 lbs which is fine with me - not ultralight like the Airbook, but it seems lightweight enough to me.

For the last ten years, my experience has been with MS based servers and workstations.  The last time I used an Apple personal computer was in 1980 when I owned an Apple II+.On a whim I purchased a MacBook running OS X 10.5.2 for my wife who has virtually no computer experience and avoids all things computer. She was not happy with my home MS Windows systems and she was not happy with the available portable computers running windows.She has taken to the MacBook like a duck takes to water. She likes the package design, the display, and the desktop layout. She does not have the experience to appreciate the thoughtful interfaces and bundled applications that come with OS X.  She just knows the entire package is enjoyable and not intimidating.Me - I like the UNIX foundation to OS-X.  Knowing the internals of both operating systems, UNIX is the clear winner when it comes to reliability, durability, predictability, consistency, and security.  Additionally, UNIX (with its open source variants) does not suffer from conflict of interest between operating systems and applications.  One always wonders if some MS Windows quirk exists to solve a development problem in some MS application.  I quickly put the terminal icon on the MacBook desktop so I could indulge myself with the UNIX shell command line any time I want ;-).I installed a third party wireless router and configured internet services on the MacBook in a few minutes.  I also added a third party optical bluetooth mouse in about thirty seconds. It took longer to install the mouse batteries than configure the MacBook bluetooth capability.Apple has a very solid package with the current MacBook. There is little that one needs to add to the MacBook.  It comes with just about every hardware interface available today.  It has ample processor, RAM, and hard disk storage for average users.  It comes with dual layer DVD RW. The bundled suite of applications is adequate for the full spectrum of casual computing (e.g., web browsing, email, chat, word processing, photo/video/audio processing).  Apple stuff is a bit pricy but you receive the value you pay for.If you want a good comprehensive companion book for your MacBook, I recommend David Pogue's \"Mac OS X Leopard: The Missing Manual\".  This book is large and contains much technical detail but is very well written.  It is not for the casual computing novice that finds reading and comprehension tedious.I have used Apple support one time and found the wait to be acceptable and support engineer to be competent, efficient and attentive.  I have used MS support many times over the years and found them to be equally capable.I have not found anything I dislike about the MacBook after thirty days of usage.  My wife, however, would like the Apple logo on the lid to glow red instead of white when the MacBook is powered up.", "Date": "March 31, 2008"}, {"Title": "Hallelujah, I just love it so", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R1M9M358SRHBF1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's what I do with my laptop: I take it into Walt Disney World and write articles and reviews of attractions, restaurants and the like for a travel guide. I do much the same thing down here on Sanibel Island, where for another book I take my computer with me in my pickup, or on my bicycle, to dig up such details as beach parking lot spaces and hiking trail finds.As you can guess, I need good battery performance. And it's for that reason alone that I waited for this new-for-spring MacBook model, and the reason I'm so happy with it. For the most part I only use Pages, so I'm not much of a power pig, but this is the first laptop I've ever had that makes it all day in the field on one charge. Don't get me wrong, I'm not typing that whole time by any means, but I often leave my MacBook on as I walk around Disney or drive from one beach to another, often open it up to type in a paragraph or two, and usually get in a couple of solid hour-long writing blocks each day.From what I've read, the better battery performance comes from the brand-new Penryn processor these new MacBooks incorporate. I can't comment on that, as except for being able to install memory I'm not too knowledgeable about stuff under the hood. But I did test out the old 2.0 GHz model against this one at an Apple store, and I can tell a slight difference in speed. Visually this MacBook is identical to its immediate predecessor, model MB061LL/B.I chose this entry-level 2.1 GHz model (with simply the 1 GB of RAM) because, like I said, I really only use Pages, with an occasional Numbers spreadsheet or video-free Keynote presentation here and there. My 2004 iBook has been great except for its battery life; now there's nothing not to love. (My Apple store rep agreed with my choice. He thought the other new MacBooks, all of which come with SuperDrives, are worth the extra cash only for those who burn DVDs.)For what it's worth I've been a Mac addict since 1984. Over the years I've used 18 Macintosh models.", "Date": "February 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with Apple", "Author": "ewest", "ReviewID": "R3G1YBHKTC3OOM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my second mac, the first died due to my own fault - apparently a computer can't handle having a bottle of beer dumped on them ;).  For the next purchase, I got the same as the first.  I've been pleased both times. I am not a tech so this review is not going to get into tech specifics.The pros:Loading time is super fast - about 10 seconds from turning it on and I'm ready to go.  Same with shutting it down.I like that all the ports are on the side and not the back so you're not flipping your laptop around trying to get the right port.Easy to use - buy it, open it up, and it's ready to go!Weight - I think mine is just under 6lbs and I carry it to class with no problems.  It's also not bulky like a lot of other laptops.  It's slim, lightweight, and professional looking.Battery life is about 5-6 hours right now.The cons:I don't like the magnetic power cord.  I move my laptop around a lot and watch videos as I go to sleep.  As I move around inevitably the cord comes out without me knowing it and I don't find out until all the battery power is gone.Keyboard - took some time getting used to it.  Also, while typing for lengths of time (and who doesn't as a student?) I come away with marks on my arms from the corners of the computer.  I do like that it would be very very hard to get anything underneath a key.Another USB would have been nice, but it's not a deal breaker for me.Overall, I would buy this computer again.

I considered the MacBook Pro but since I don't do any heavy video editing, 3D or gaming there is little practical advantage to the Pro model. This is a fast little machine that hits a sweet spot of price, portability and performance. Build quality is nice, too. I think the black model looks a little bit better looking but I'm not paying a $140 premium for the color.(after hard drive upgrade price factored in)I also looked at Sony and Toshiba. (Don't tell my Mac friends) because I thought I might be able to save a few hundred bucks. I could, but not for a comparable notebook. It's true that you get what you pay for. Figuring in comparable specs, weight, AV/spyware software, and sound card quality there is really no Windows based laptop for less.At 5 pounds this is a nice and light computer. iBooks, and now I suppose, MacBooks have a good reputation for being tough enough to stand up to school kids so I don't have a problem with the plastic case. I was waiting until Apple announced an update and am glad I did. The faster processor is nice and finally Apple added a reasonable amount of RAM (2GB). The 160 GB hard drive is adequate for my needs and noticeably quicker than the 4200 RPM drive in my old laptop.Wi-Fi reception is pretty good, as is battery life. Both are a above average but not tops for laptops. The magnetic power connector is a great touch. I've tripped over power cords before. This should simply detach without tripping me or sending the MacBook crashing to the floor.The keyboard takes some getting used to. At first I didn't think I'd like the button like keys, but within a couple of days I found that I didn't notice. They do seem less likely to get crumbs under them than normal keys. I had a similar reaction to the glass screen. At first I was bothered by its reflectiveness, and quickly didn't see it anymore. It's there if I pay look for it but, usually just don't see it. And I like the punchier colors it displays compared to matte screens, as well as its ease of cleaning. There's no need for expensive specialty screen cleaners that the soft matte screens require.I do have a couple of small quibbles that didn't go away. I wish the trackpad had two buttons instead of one. It took Apple 15 years to finally decide to make a right clickable mouse and they should get on the ball and add a second button to their laptops. There is some two finger tap thing you can do with the trackpad but that isn't obvious or natural for me.My old iBook came with a RGB connector. The new MacBook doesn't, or any other video out connector. That's an add on that I had to spring for.I'm really liking the Leopard OS. I run OS X (Tiger), Windows XP and Gentoo Linux on other computers so am used to switching between operating systems.

I thought 10 years of windows use would make the first month or so a hassle, but it was a surprisingly easy transition. Leopard is fast, easy to use, and has great features. The browser Firefox and Microsoft Word are the same, and bootcamp/parallels allow you to run Windows within Mac seamlessly if you need a windows program for some reason.Just one tip for people trying to decide between this or the considerably more expensive Macbook Pro- aside from the video card, the main difference is the screen size and the speakers. For this upgrade, you pay about double the price. I suspect they deliberately kept the Macbook screens stuck at 13\" to push people to go up a tier.By buying the Macbook, you can afford to get 2 extra gigabytes of ram to compensate for the videocard, a full-size, 22\" monitor, a decent 2-button mouse, and a mac external keyboard.At your desktop, hook up the mouse and the keyboard to the macbook and make the larger monitor your primary one, and you have an excellent desktop computer. If you have parallels, you can run windows on the macbook monitor, and OSX on the larger monitor, and switch between then effortlessly. When you leave work, just unplug the macbook from the keyboard and monitor, and boom, your powerful desktop just turned into a laptop. It's the best of both worlds.These extras more than compensate for the Macbook Pro's extras, And it'll still be cheaper for you to do it this way!", "Date": "April 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "What was I waiting for?", "Author": "A.

And the glossy screen? Don't believe what others tell you; the colors are vibrant and beautiful. I am not at all bothered by the glossy screen. I got more than five hours of time out of the battery, and this is more than even Apple's estimate. The form factor on this laptop is very nice. It is a head turner for sure although the design is not exactly new or innovative.So if you're debating whether to buy the MacBook, I would give this computer a glowing reccomendation.

The last Mac I owned was in 1989, it was an Apple II+ (I kid you not).  Since then, it's been PC after PC for me, until now.  In March 2008, I needed a new laptop, and I purchased the Black MacBook.  So far, I am a seriously happy camper.  A few tweaks to make sure I could use my favorite Windows programs (ie also installing Windows XP via VMware Fusion) and I'm very content.PROS:* Mac OS X is intuitive, user friendly, and easy to understand.  I am a big fan, and I've only had this laptop for 3 months.  The more I use it, the more I like it.* The screen is stunningly beautiful.  It is the clearest, brightest, easiest screen to read I've ever had.  Set it next to any PC laptop, and there is no comparison.* The \"MagSafe\" magnetic power connector is perfect.  I've never knocked the MacBook off of a table, even though I've pulled the cord out many times.*  I didn't have to leave behind my killer Windows XP programs!  I installed VMware Fusion, and now boot Windows XP right from within Mac OS X.  Very VERY nice and handy.  My only suggestion is to bump the RAM to 4GB before installing VMware Fusion.  Works stunningly well.*  Battery life (and power management) are stunningly good.  I get a legit 3-4 hours of battery life out of this laptop, compared to 1-2 hours out of all of my old PC laptops.* User friendly software built in such as iMovie.  My wife needed a DVD created for work.  An hour later, I had a DVD with menu system, her photos, music, etc.  Everybody loved it.*  User friendly System Preferences and settings in the Apple menu.  Much better than Start --> Settings --> Control Panel in Windows.  Just a better design and more user friendly access to settings.*  GEEKY:  The fan does not vent on the bottom!  So your legs aren't blocking it and feeling warm fan air.  Instead the fan vents up the front of the screen.  Very VERY smart, and I rarely hear it running.*  GEEKY:  Programs install as one .app file.  Sure there are settings hiding in various places, but Mac programs usually involve one BIG .app file.*  GEEKY:  Better flash drive integration.  This is similar to Linux (and obviously UNIX), drives are mounted and dismounted.  No two or three clicks to \"safely remove hardware\" like in Windows.  You just \"eject\" a flash drive (or CD or other drive) and remove it... as it should be.*  GEEKY:  Encrypted disk images.  You can use built in software to create password protected \"Disk Images\".  These can easily be mounted and unmounted, protecting sensitive files.*  GEEKY:  Terminal, Automator, the Dock, and Finder.  Well made robust tools that allow my \"inner geek\" to customize and do whatever they want.CONS:* No card reader built in?  This is a VERY stupid idea on Apple's part.  Almost every PC laptop now comes with a built in card reader.  MacBooks should also.* Only two USB slots.  Would be nice to have 3 or 4.  Not the end of the world, but could be improved.* Cost.  Mac people always tell me about TCO \"Total Cost Of Ownership\" and the like when justifying the higher cost.  Fact is, the MacBook DOES cost more.  Don't let anybody tell you it doesn't.  But the more I use it, the more I think the extra cost is worth it and the less the cost bothers me.  \"You get what you pay for\" is what obviously comes to mind.  For lack of a better term, it's an elegant machine.* That's about it.  Seriously, there aren't really any other major problems with this laptop.ON THE FENCE:* The keyboard is (at first) very different coming from a PC background.  I have since grown to love it, but it is an acquired taste.  Now that I'm used to it, I am impressed with how easy text \"flows\" and how much less effort I need to press keys.  However, white letters on black keys is tough in lower light conditions sometimes.Overall, the MacBook is what a laptop computer really should be.  Little details individually don't mean much, but when many subtle touches are added together with a powerful stable user-oriented clean UNIX based operating system like OS X, the result is the best laptop I've ever had.I will be sticking with Macs for a long time to come I think.", "Date": "June 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "From A Clunker (MS) To A Maserati (Mac)", "Author": "J. Aubrey", "ReviewID": "RD5FAZNXCGHZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a Windows user for 15 years.  Although interested in a Mac, compatibility with the Windows network at my office made me hesitate.  I'm now retired and since my ThinkPad was getting on (and acting up), I went with the MacBook.I was surprised at the marked superiority of the Mac right out of the box.  By \"superior\" I mean in all material respects--both hardware and software.  I realize some IT types, gamers and others may see some advantages to Windows, but I see none for a user like me (primarily internet, email, iTunes, word processing and photos).  It was a revelation to find a computer so stable and user friendly.  Other adjectives that come to mind:  Solid, Fast, Fun, Pretty, Snappy, Sleek.  From frustration to the sublime.I could go on describing the improved design, but let me give just one, seemingly trivial but representative, example.  I don't like trackpads, so I use a mouse.  In Windows several steps were needed to disable the trackpad and enable the mouse.  On a couple of occasions I forgot the mouse and had to enable the trackpad using keystrokes.  Frustrating and time consuming.  I ordered a wireless mighty mouse with the MacBook and enabled it in 30 seconds.  While searching Help to disable the trackpad, I noticed it was already disabled.  Then I realized it was automatically disabled when the mouse was added.  Then I learned  it was automatically enabled when the mouse was turned off or moved away from the computer.  Such a simple solution, but apparently lost on the Windows engineers.Finally--the operating system and compatibility.  The Mac OS is different from Windows and takes some getting used to.  But not as much as I expected due to the intuitive nature of the Mac, the actually helpful Help menu and the hundreds of very well done tutorials on the Apple web site.  As to compatibility, the Office for Mac suite does the trick, but know there is a different interface for Word, Excel and Power Point, so there is a learning curve for editing.  But I had no problem opening and editing documents,spreadsheets and presentations in Office Mac and sending them back to Windows, and vice versa.In short, my apprehensions about making the switch proved groundless, while being treated to a distinct upgrade in product.

After months of heavy use the hinges are still snug and the screen is just as bright. 2GB will take care of most people's needs.Also, and this is very important, since this is an Intel based machine you can install windows (or run Parallels, Fusion or Crossover) if you have one or two legacy Apps that you absolutely can't do without. A PC can't run OS X or any of its great applications, but a Mac can run Windows right along side Mac OS program with Parallels, VMWare Fusion or Crossover.So, if you're trying to decide between a Mac for OS X and the easy of use I talk about below and a PC for old Windows programs, you can choose both by buying this or any Intel based Mac (which is all shipping models).The Hardware is simply top notch. In its stock configuration you can do anything 99% of computer users do. And with a third party app, you can do the last 1%. OS X is Unix. Then you have the Mac OS (OS X) and you have he option of running Windows. So, really Macs these days are THE machine IT professionals are turning to in droves.The Software (is what makes Macs shine):OS X is extremely stable. It is a Unix OS, so advanced users can easily do anything from a command line they can do on any Unix system from a command line using the terminal application. If you don't understand the previous sentence you don't have to because the user interface as easy or easier than Windows and you never have to learn complex commands to unleash the power of the system.The only time I reboot is when I install software that requires a reboot. (Currently My Uptime is over 21 days -- since I installed an OS Update, and I have no doubt the system could remain on for months without needing a reboot). That's almost unheard of in Windows land, where often the machine chokes on some process and the only option is a reboot.You can't mess up the system by clicking the wrong button, or putting the wrong file in the trash -- OS X doesn't allow that and requires an administrator password to change any important settings.Adding Users is as simple as clicking a new account button, typing in their name and a password. Then you can switch users with a click and be secure in the knowledge that your kids or grandma can't mess up the system or your settings (because they'll have their own set), or applications.The system is very secure out of the box, and configuring to server web pages is a simple click and drag documents into a folder and flip the Sharing panel switch on. There's a built in Firewall that's extreme easy to configure. Wireless performance is top notch. There is zero downside to buying this machine.Installing Applications is often a simple process of clicking and dragging the application into any folder or subfolder you want. Uninstalling is a simple matter of dragging thhe program, or program folder into the trash. No messy registry, no dicey uninstall apps that might delete a shared DLL, nothing like that at all.Adding Other hardware to the machine is also a simple process of double clicking an installer (if it's even needed) and plugging in he hardware. You never experience hardware conflicts like you do in Windows. You just plug it in and it works.If you've never used a computer or want to migrate from Windows or another Operating System, a Macintosh is an excellent choice. I've never had a person I recommended a Mac to come back and say, \"This was a mistake, \" or \"I hate it\" or \"I can't figure out how to use it.\" They usually thank me and gleefully tell me they never realized using (and even administrating) a computer could be so easy.Mac VS. PC (Real world stories):I HAVE had many, many people come back to me after purchasing a Windows only Machine against my advice months or years later regretting it. They didn't realize a Windows based computer would be so much work, or that it wouldn't be reliable.Windows XP is a bear to manage and Vista is the same bear, but just in a shiny coat with a bow. And all you can get on new computers these days is Vista. And I have yet to run into anyone, technician or layman, who even likes Vista. Sure you can downgrade to XP, but you have ot make sure there's XP drivers available for your system before you downgrade it, because if not, you'll end up with Audio or Wireless not working, and have to put Vista back on. A friend went through this exact experience.There are some quality PC makers out there, but most are junk. If you're wondering why the MacBook costs hundreds of dollars more than a PC, remember, you get what you pay for. The margins Apple makes for a Mac are comparable to what PC manufacturers make nowadays. So, realize that most PC manufacturers are using cheaper (read \"low quality\") parts, and they're going to fail a lot sooner than a typical Mac would.Viruses and Security:Windows is way behind the Mac when it comes to security and virus prevention. Microsoft's solution was to pop up a dialog box for anything and everything a virus might do to try to gain control of a Windows PC. The effect: annoying the hell out of users. The OS X way: run in a mode where only things such as installing applications will bother the user. That and only check the first time if someone wants to run a new application. Once that's done the OS gets out of your way and let's you get your work done. Also, if this sounds too open, you can tighten down security simply by checking boxes in most cases. If you want to secure your machine's network connections even more try Lil Snitch.Caveats:Almost all computers will have problems. The Mac is no exception. You might get a lemon, but apple's return policy is great. With Applecare you're covered for the practical usable life of the computer (3 years).  A hard rive might die on you: that's where backing up comes in. Backup your data. The more important, the more often you should backup. Other than that most Mac problems are simple and might just require a setting change or (at worst) a reinstall of the application. With Windows you might have to reinstall the OS and each and every application. For software and hardware problems Apple's tech support is top notch. If something needs ot be replaced -- like a bad LCD (which is rarer and rarer these days), you'll often have the machine back in a few days if you choose to ship it in for repair. Just get Applecare with your system and you'll be set.The Bottom Line:Macs are far superior to PCs. Take it from a guy who makes money off of repairing computers. If this is to be your first computer, you probably couldn't make a better choice. If you're a Windows user considering a sea change, you couldn't pick a better time to do it -- especially considering that with a third party App you can still run Windows apps if you want to. And believe me you won't want to after experiencing the level of usability of the standard OS X application. And if you're one of those RARE Mac users considering saving money, and thinks computers are all the same: save your sanity and not just a couple of bucks, and turn away from Sony, Dell or HP.", "Date": "September 25, 2008"}, {"Title": "It just works...", "Author": "S.

Granted my schools computers I used we're Apple II's in the 80's and even the Mac 128k's in the 90's. But I've always been a Windows user building my own PC's and maxing out graphics cards and what have you. Been in the IT/IS industry since 2001.The thing is I'd come home from fixing computer problems to a computer/s with random problems. Maybe Windows didn't recognize the drivers to my graphics card for some reason and I had to reinstall it. Or a laptop that I downgraded from Vista to XP (Really though, downgrade?) suddenly starts overheating (only after sleep mode starts) because the manufacturer made software (not hardware) control the fan and the software only runs on Vista. Finally I had enough, I just wanted something that works.So almost shamefully/embarrassingly I bought an iMac. How dare I? I could build a computer for the same price with X times more performance! But after I started using it I realized I could stop worrying about that stuff and just start using the computer. Like Obi'wan says to Luke \"Just let go\" Mac's are a whole new world. The idea of make it easy to use spreads over to people who make the software for it, not just Apple software but third party's. Yes you can do everything on a Mac now. And sure you may have to install Windows to play your favorite games. But I've spent so much of my time seeing and fixing all the wonderfully awful problems that Windows spews out that it's nice to have a liberating experience on a computer that just works. Plugging in things like cameras or printers for the first time nothing happens. No window pop's up asking you to configure anything they're ready to go.I don't find myself having to go into a registry and change some variables because a toolbar disapeared. Or finding out that Creative doesn't fully support Vista for the sound card I bought dispite the box saying it does.I'm familiar with Linux and the OS is based on BSD/Unix. So your getting the shell, and you can run apache and php on it. With sooooo much less configuration then you would be looking to do with a windows box. And the thing about the spec's is your getting an OS tied into the hardware so much that performance is great. Windows has to account for a lot of different hardware configurations so sacrifices are made.And no your not buying a lifestyle your buying something that just works so you can get to work. You don't have to use these at starbucks drinking a latte and talking about your Jetta or how you voted for Obama. And you aren't going to become a pretentious snob.I haven't even mention the hardware of this particular Macbook. But things like a magnetically closing lid means there are no moving parts to break. Same with the power supply which is connected magnetically. It doesn't scorch my manhood from overheating. And it's very quite. I haven't heard the fan or harddrive kick on into overdrive at all like most laptops.Funny thing is I understand I probably sound like a snob talking about Mac's but in a lot of important ways they are better then PC's. When are PC's going to stop becoming things that get in the way of life?

So, let me just speak to my best personal observations and leave all the tech speak to others.I've been a life long Apple / Mac user. The first computer I ever touched was an Apple / Mac, but I can't tell you the model number. All I remember is that large, rainbow colored Apple logo! LOL Anyway, I always preferred Macs to PC's--even though I was often required to use PC's at work. At home, the computer was alway Mac!Just recently, I was shopping for a new laptop; I wanted a small, flexible, but powerful system that was easy to take and easy to use. I was actually tempted--the shame of it--by a good deal on a fine looking Sony Vaio. I compared it to the MacBook and MacBook Pro. I mulled over the decision for a week, and I had the opportunity to look at a new laptop with Vista, the flowered-faced monster operating system that everyone at work seems to be complaining about as everyone receives their upgrades in turn. To make a long story short, good \"Mac\" sense finally kicked in, and I eliminated the Viao from my potential purchase list. [I might have to work with Vista at the office, but I don't have to live with it, even if it comes in a pretty package! LOL] I then had to decide between the MacBook and MacBook Pro. AND at the end of the day, the deal breaker came down to choice: MacBook gave a choice between Black and White. [The MacBook Pro looks rather silver.] Well, I've had beige Macs and white Macs and Graphite colored Macs. I never had a Black one. So, the black one with its generous keyboard and large trackpad appealed to me.With hand on my heart, I can say that this is the best Mac I've ever had the opportunity to operate; it is the best Mac that I have ever personally owned. The software that I chose to get for this new computer was IWork 08 because I read good things about it--if you don't want or need all of Microsoft Office's bulk and sulk. I also purchased Internet Security Barrier Back-up Edition and StoryMill.

I read every review I could get my hands on. I trawled forums, review centres and video sites.And, probably like many of you reading this review, I had some major doubts: would it smudge too much? Are the edges really that sharp? Would the 13.3\" screen be too small? Would the transition from PC to Mac be a steep learning curve?I am delighted to report that all my doubts were blown away within the first 24 hours.Yep, it smudges. When you first pull it out of the box you'll have an immediate kinship with all those who complained about it. But really, I couldn't care less about it. I don't actually have to look at the smudges as I work on the Macbook, and they are easily wiped away with a cloth if you are fashion-conscious. It is worth noting that it is a fair price to pay for a very robust, leathery, sexy-looking shell.I cannot complain regarding the so-called \"sharp edges\". I'm a man with fairly long reach, I spend hours upon hours writing on my Macbook, and I have not had a single problem with my wrists.My greatest worry was over the screen size. I have always used 15.4\" screens with my laptops, and I was quite terrified that I'd find the 13.3\" screen too small. I was wrong. Profoundly wrong. I actually enjoy this size much better than my old 15.4\" laptops, which now feel big and heavy and cumbersome in comparison.What you will notice immediately is that the keyboard and trackpad are very big and inviting, and the screen is so crisp and clear that you feel right at home. And although the Macbook IS heavier than you would think, I ultimately find that its smaller size is much, much better all-round.And the PC to Mac conversion could not have been easier.I booted it up and it was ready to go. I spent hours playing with all the new toys at my disposal, and I have to say I never knew that computing could be this much fun. I know that there is a lot of hoo-ha over a Macbook's price in comparison to cheaper PCs, but what you quickly realise is that you are really paying the extra for the software...and for a few hundred dollars extra, you are getting a bargain.Examples. Photo Booth is an enormous amount of fun. The in-built webcam (with a very decent resolution) focuses on your face and gives you a 3-2-1 countdown before snapping with a flash. Before you take the photo you can easily select different styles you want the photo taken in, such as sepia, black and white, or even a kind of Warhol-ic mesh of colours. Just great fun, especially for families and couples, or individuals looking to track their daily weight loss as a visual record!You can also use the webcam to make short films of yourself (what you choose to do with that is entirely up to you!) and, of course, for having vis-a-vis chats on a whole multitude of instant messaging clients (including the excellent in-built iChat feature, which is easy to set up with any AOL or Google Talk account).It has a wonderful dictionary that looks up words in a fraction of a millisecond, It has a little tool that enables you to take snapshots of portions of your desktop (or the entire desktop). And then the iLife suite is just superb. Never has it been easier to publish a really professional looking website, or to quickly edit a movie, or put together a lovely photo album. I'm not a music junkie, but Garage Band is universally accepted as being brilliant for budding musicians.Then there is the Finder tool at the top right of the screen. Just type in a few letters and BINGO, you can instantly find anything you want to, whether it's an application or a document. Magic!Trust me, I am just skimming the surface when it comes to Mac's software suite. Heck, even I am still discovering new tools every day. It truly is a wonderful machine, giving you a really premium experience without any requirement of technical expertise. Compare that to your average PC laptop which comes bundled with a bunch of third-rate software that you never, ever use. The Macbook, in sharp contrast, practically seduces you into trying out all of its cool features.Oh, and this thing is FAST. Blazing fast. I can run a gazillion programs and it handles it with ease. To date I have suffered no heat on the Macbook, and noise is a thing of the past (this thing is like a ninja in slippers).And with the ability to run Windows software if I absolutely have to thanks to the Boot Camp feature, I cannot think of a single reason to dislike this puppy.I think that's what they call a \"rave\". Congratulations, Apple!

My previous laptop, a Dell, caused me problems the first month I purchased it. It was terribly slow, had a battery life no longer than an hour and a half at most, and often would freeze up while I was using it. After having it only one year, the battery was shot and the computer wouldn't even run unless it was plugged in at all times. Eventually it blacked out and never turned on again.After all this, the MacBook makes my life so much easier since it runs extremely fast and isn't able to get the viruses that plagued my PC. The programs it comes with are easy to use and have more features than Windows programs. For example, iPhoto will automatically take your imported digital pictures and separate them into different events based on the time they were taken. This saves a lot of time when uploading photos because you don't have to manually select pictures to separate into an album. iChat is a smoother, more professional version of AOL Instant Messenger. Also, the built-in webcam takes surprisingly detailed photos that can be easily edited with the Photo Booth.The MacBook is a sturdy, dependable computer and is well worth the extra couple hundred bucks since it will save you a lot of the hassle PCs come with.  If you need to check something quickly, you can have the computer turned on and the internet running just a few seconds after pushing the power button. It is able to handle multiple programs running at once without slowing down or freezing.Many people are afraid to purchase a MacBook because they are unfamiliar with it and believe the programs are difficult to run. This isn't true at all, since I've found that the advanced design of Macs is much more simple to navigate then Windows. My dad has the same computer I do and feels the same way.

I thought the transition from windows would be difficult, but it wasn't at all. The entire system is extremely easy to use. It just takes getting used to. Everything from the address book, calendar, to mail feature is easier to use than the PC versions. I can sync my calendar and to do lists to my iPod quickly and easily. That is a great feature for being as active as I am. The only thing that took serious getting used to was the Microsoft Office applications. The layout is very different. And figuring it all out took some time. The note taking ability of Word is very different though. I like it better. It can actually look like you're writing on notebook paper and flag certain areas of the notes that are important. If that is too much for you to get used to, Macs can also run windows, so it wouldn't be a problem. Another feature that fits my lifestyle perfectly is the options with photos. With my old PC I felt like I was always uploading new software with every digital camera to make it possible to upload pictures and then other software for editing pictures. It got confusing. With the Macbook, as soon as I plugged my digital camera in it starting working. I could upload pictures, edit them, and they were never saved to an area of my computer that was hard to locate later.

I've been using it as a substitute for my old desktop PC as well as a  portable and its great in every role.  With a usb hub it can do everything I want from a desktop and fast.  As a portable it's light and compact and very easy to carry around.  I certainly think it's the best Mac for most people as an all round computer, other Mac models do some things better but this does everything well and certainly the basic computing functions, editing documents and browsing, playing music, work beautifully.  I've played DVDs on long bus journeys and it's great for that.  Since Macs are a better experience than PCs I think this is the best computer around.  I strongly recommend using Mac with the native Safari browser, a beautiful and fast browser, perfectly integrated into its environment.  I also strongly recommend iWork, which has to be paid for after free 30 day trial.

It's far far better than MS Office, and no one with a Mac really needs the Office for Mac package which is more expensive than iWork.  Possibly for some very specialised business purposes Offices still has advantages over iWork, but as an all round word processing/presentation/spread sheet package it's a beautiful experience which does everything I need quickly (and I'm  heavy user of word processing and related utilities) and and like most things Mac its both simple, no clutter, and stylish.  It fits perfectly into the Mac OS environment, making it even more of a pleasure.

Well, a MacBook pro I guess would be better, but anyways...Pros:-Amazing battery life, I usually got like 4 hours somehow-Really powerful, every app was very snappy, even if I had a ton of apps open-It's an apple (woot)-The screen looks REALLY good.  I had the glossy one, and it was like HD happiness every time I watched a movie-Keyboard feels really good-Mouse has great feedback, but not annoyingly sensitive (like when you're typing and bump it, it doesn't send the mouse flying opening Photoshop when you're trying to work on a something else and not in the mood to force quit photoshop before i got the activation screen of adobe death (I had a 30 day trial and forgot to delete it)-webcam / skype happiness-Mac OS X is really really really easy to understand.  I was a Windows junkie before I used a mac and i learned how to use a mac in seriously a day or 2, it's really intuitive.Cons-the underside can get kind of hot if you're doing processor-intensive activities, but that's true with basically all laptops unless you have a cooling mat/fan under itThe screen isn't great for outdoors, but neither is any other glossy screen.It might be a good idea to get a spare power adapter, because although the magsafe power adapters are really genius, what tends to happen  is the wire inside the sleeve gets untwisted, so you you get like twisting bumps on the wire... if that makes sense.

It's also important for me to know that I can take my laptop to class and not be worried about the loss of too much battery. The Macbook's battery life is very impressive compared to my other laptops I have owned. I can get at least 3 hours of battery life off of the charger. IT'S AMAZING!!!  I am also into graphic designing, and with the Macbook's fast processor and AMAZING Adobe Photoshop CS3 software, I can makeup something that some can only dream of. The Macbook's pristine 13.3-inch glossy screen display makes all of my graphics, along with movies and other visual items, to pop out of the screen.If you are in the field of searching for a new laptop, I strongly encourage you to check out the Macbook, it will be a worthwhile purchase!", "Date": "November 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Tremendous package of features!!", "Author": "J.

Now after using windows for 20 years, I figured there would be a learning curve.  I was very surprised how easy this computer is to use.  Somethings I had to learn, but for the most part I took it out of the box and I was up and running.After 5 months of use, I never had a problem with my system.  I have over 5,000 photos, about 1,000 videos, 5,000 songs, and a bunch of other software for work/school/church ministry (30,000 or more documents).  With the mac apps I have switched to, I find that they are more stable and more intuitive than MS Windows based apps.I recommend this computer very highly.  In fact, because of the quality and stability - I bought my wife a mac mini (she did not want a laptop).Buy this computer and you will be very pleased.  You can do anything that MS can do, and better with the right native mac OS X apps.  and if it is not on a mac, well.... you can still run Windows on this computer in bootcamp or a virtual machine like VMFUSION or PARALLELS...Everyone I know that has tried a mac, or has seen mine, now wants one.As for those posts about a mac crashing - ok maybe 1 or 2 in a manufactoring run may have a defect (but that is the nature in electronics in general); but everyone I know who has switched to a mac never has had a problem.  I do suggest the Applecare warrenty, just in case.  But unlike other laptops - this is the first one that something did not break, nor have I had to reformat  the hard drive after a few months....  5 months of everyday use for 4-5 hrs or more and still running like the day I took delivery on it.With mac os x, I  found I did not need all the software I had - as a lot is built into the operating system and iLife that comes with the computer.Time machine backups is great.  It makes an exact copy of the hard drive, then copies of every files.  I could just unplug the external hard drive and plug it into another computer (PC or MAC) and browse right to the file - unlike other backup software that requires special disks and mounting the drive.also, I bought a Wacom Bamboo tablet and plugged it in.  recognized it with no problems.  Turned on the inkwell and handwriting recognition in the preferences for OS X, and now I have a tablet-like PC.  while I cannot write directly on the screen, this is the next best thing.Switching from windows to this was a breeze.Update 4/2/2011 - After 3 years of heavy use, this laptop never failed on me once.  Never had to re-install anything, unlike window where I would have to re-install at least twice by now.  Due to all my native OSX apps, I deleted Parallels.  I no longer need Windows for anything, unless I am working on an MS SQL Server project.  I must say, out of all the laptops and desktops I have eve owned since the 1980's - this has been the most reliable.  I have since grown to needing 1.5 tb of space due to all my music, photos, video, documents, etc.  I imagine I can get another 2+ years out of this, as it still runs as if it was just pulled out of the box.  I rarely torn this machine off.  The only time it is rebooted is when a software update requires it or I need to take it somewhere (less so now that I own an iPad).  Otherwise, this machine stays turned on 24X7.  I also heavily render videos on it.  Considering upgrading it to 4gb ram, due to newer video software being resource intensive.  Not a problem for the CPU, more so that my complex videos are running down the ram.Again, this is the best computer I ever bought.  I have used it for work also, when my Work Windows Dell was down.  That Dell went through 2 hard drives motherboard and power supply.  They gave me a new one with raid, and it crashed both raid drives in a year.  I was really surprised how this laptop out performed a quad core 4gb Dell GPX 750.  Was so happy, I bought my wife a mini in 2008 and that never crashed either.Happy owner of 2 macs, and iPad, and 2 iphones.

Another thing that people don't realize is macs retain their value VERY well.  I sold my powerbook g4 1ghz titanium for $550 in oct 2007 which originally cost $3k in 11/02(i bought it used for $500 in 12/05).

If you want a great dependable and quick mac this is the one to get, especially now that you can find it at discounted prices since the new macbooks came out.

Should be more than enough for most people.Only negative I can think of is fingerprints, but hey, what are you going to do!", "Date": "February 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Am I A PC Or A Mac?", "Author": "Caleb Williams", "ReviewID": "R20P2JIR9NHQZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well up to the point at which I bought my first Mac, I was definitely a PC but now I know what I've been missing. Apple have been on the rise over the past few years thanks to their wonderful invention of the iPod. There's no doubting that the mass media attention surrounding Apple thanks to the iPod has lead to an increase in sales of the Mac. Honestly, that's the reason I decided to get a Mac when my last Windows laptop broke and I've not looked back.Aesthetically, the Macs are just gorgeous to look at both on the outside and in the operating system software. That is Apples biggest selling point, make it simple and make it pretty. Pretty it is, but at first simple it is not. Having been a user of Windows software since I've been able to use a computer, getting used to the Max operating system created a learning curve which I couldn't be bothered with at the time. It really is so easy that I felt like a pro using it within about half an hour.Thanks to the 2GB Ram of my laptop the transission between programs is almost flawless and because I generally don't do that much on my computers anyway, just word processing and the likes, I have noticed almost no lag in the running of the programs. The laptop itself is light, sturdy and just very durable as it has been knocked about a bit.Battery life is around 4 hours on low power mode which is very, very impressive as I generally need to use this to do work outside the home without the absence of an electrical output. Because the AC adaptor of my model connects magnetically, I have to say that it's a very very cool feature but worry about how long it will last before the magnet decides not to attach itself to my laptop.It does come in a few different colours, (Black, Silver, White) and silver would get the recommendation from me as it just seems fitting and better looking overall. The processor works perfectly and as mentioned before there is pretty much no lag in switching between programs. Virus possibilities are almost non-existent as it's very rare that virus's are made to attack Mac software so there's no need for virus detection software.There is little to no need to update your Mac software as it's top of the range when you buy it and genuinely ahead of the market. The load and shut down times are almost half of any Windows PC making that even more appealing as if you need to get to your work quickly, you can. It doesn't generate any large amount of heat from the processor so you can place the laptop in sleep mode and leave it overnight without the worry of overheating.If you want to look cool in Starbucks then you should buy one of these, and if you want to do your work with little difficulty, then you should buy it.

I'm now afraid it will break when traveling.Perhaps you're thinking, \"No big deal I'll pick up a 3rd party adapter\" -- wrong.  Apple for some idiotic reason has placed a patent on its poorly designed power adapter and made it super expensive -- as in $70 expensive!  So in a nut shell they are forcing you to spend $70 for a faulty piece of equipment every few months while increasing the fustration/worry factor -- very very poor move.Instead, I found a 3rd party supplier in China through eBay and ordered one from them with a 3 year warranty.Its only the power adapter worries that had me rate this 4-stars.

Quite frankly I didn't think we would be writing any adverse review for any Apple product. But here I am doing just that and simply stated I would recommend that any of you considering this MacBook and who also rely heavily on wireless connectivity for your laptop to delay your purchase indefinitely until Apple has resolved an inherent wireless connectivity problem with OS 10.5.5.I use this MacBook as my kitchen work station and rely completely on our wireless LAN (Apple Airport) as I have no ethernet port in the kitchen area of our house.  I am now experiencing numerous drop outs of both my internet connection and my LAN and this started after upgrading to Apple's OS 10.5.5 which appears to be the version that now comes installed on this laptop.In reviewing numerous posts on Apple's \"support\" web-site it is clear that a significant population of other users of this same MacBook have the identical wireless connectivity problem with OS 10.5.5 and have been asking, pleading for help from Apple, e.g., that Apple fix their faulty software as in put it back through a full SQT. What we seem to have received is a Beta version they foisted on their customer base for debugging. I have yet to find anything on Apple's web-site offered by Apple that remotely addresses this problem.Although otherwise this MacBook is an excellent performer, in this day and age there is an absolute need for reliable laptop wireless connectivity. Therefore we are very disappointed in this product's wireless performance as well as Apple's apparent lack of concern for their loyal customer base. After all, what good is a laptop with random wireless connectivity?  One day of this failure mode is one day too many and It is doubtful we will purchase another Apple computer until our confidence in their quality and customer responsiveness is restored. At the very least Apple should issue a statement admitting to the problem, indicating they are attempting to resolve the problem and specify a planned date for its resolution.In the meantime buyer BEWARE of the Apple MacBook MB404LL/A 13.3-inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) Black which is an expensive laptop that offers worthless wireless performance!!", "Date": "December 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "From PC to Mac - It took 20 years.", "Author": "M.

Getting curious?On a borrowed Aspire One net book (wow, what a piece of garbage) I started searching for my software apps on Mac.  Everything I needed was there, including my trading platform; Think or Swim, even my Pulse LiveScribe was now supported with a native Mac app.So which one to buy? Prices seem a little steep here.  Thinking thoughts like: \"Proprietary hardware and software = gauging customers\" and \"Why buy this when a Dell for a grand is as powerful and I don't have to relearn how to think\" but in the end I made a decision.I chose the MacBook 13\" with the 2.4 ghz processor. I bought it from Apple's refurb link on the web site. I was was sent there by the dude in the Apple store. He told me it's identical to new and comes with the same warantee. He was right; feels new, acts new, can't tell the difference.Then I surfed Other World Computing's web site and spent about a hundred more and bought 4 gig of ram and a 7200 hd.  So now my machine is ready for what normally would be considered heavy usage.  While I waited for my upgrades to arrive, I started using the computer. It's fast, no doubt, but it's smoother than I expected. Everything flows seamlessly, a lot of care has been taken to make things easier than expected.While I have a 4 gig Windows desktop (actually 32 bit Windows only lets you access 3.25 gig) I know how that gets bogged down when I have all my apps and windows open so I thought 4 gig would be essential.  I read that all Macs can natively access 6 gig of ram, an excellent fact to tuck away for those days of photoshop and lightroom while on airplanes. I went for a bigger hard drive (320 gig) but at a higher speed; 7200 rpm.  After all, it's an extra hundred. If you priced that on the Apple site you would need to sell relatives to get those upgrades.  So for $1299 and an extra hundred, I have a macbook that rivals my desktop.But wait a minute, I don't have all those upgrades installed right away, I still use the machine in it's humbled state; paltry 2 gig ram and pokey 5400 rpm drive.  I can read email, thinking I will bide my time until the UPS driver crosses the Mississippi and make it out my way, and like Woah!  This sucker is fast.  And it's running everything at once. Apps just pop open.I start to check out GarageBand and promptly make an appointment at the Apple store for one of their free classes, I take my 14 year old daughter. It's love at 1st site. She's a singer, formally trained and up and coming. (I know, I am Dad.)  And I am watching this training class - totally blown away - watching her eyes sparkle and I realize this would accelerate her move to a professional recording environment, allow her to make demo's, learn how to mix and sequence music, while using their lessons to improve piano and guitar. And this software is free with the computer.  I realized that I had to get her one.  Yeah, it's another grand, but this is not a toy or a gizmo (uh, well... maybe it is fun and cool) but more of a tool for advancing her abilities and skills.Now, I start to dig around some more into the \"free stuff\" that comes with a Mac. There's a photo editing program (iPhoto), a movie maker (iMovie), a continuous backup system (Time Machine), mail client, contact tracker and other \"features\" to make life easier.It's now 4 hours on one charge, the battery life is at least double that of my sony.  * I am hooked * Now, I have this laptop that flies through space and I have this 3 monitor setup on my desk with a PC (lead anchor) as it's engine.  Its all too depressing.  Why is Apple about to take most of my money, why, why?  I'll tell you why, because this is what using a computer is about.So now that I am done raving about this new experience, I should sober you up a little and let you know some of the cold hard facts that might help you decide which mac is good for you.First; the 13\" MacBook with 2.4 ghz processor is nice but the 2.0 processor is probably fine for most things for most people.  If you are graphics intensive, the Pro is a better fit. It's $500 more so you gotta need it to spend that money.Missing: Why doesn't a mac book have a built-in card reader? Photographers will miss this. What about a real video-out jack? Apple seems bent of getting an extra $30 to connect an external monitor.Deficient: The screen can't go black.  While it's not that important and may not be noticed by most, photographers and videographers will notice.  Seems like a real problem that can only be solved by getting the pro version.Uncomfortable: The sharp edges on the Aluminum frame are tough on my hands while leaning my palms on it to use the touch pad.Awkward: Showing up at meetings where everyone else is still using pc's.Onward: Enjoying computing like I did 20 years ago. What do you think, should I ditch my Treo/Verizon and go to an iPhone on AT&T;, where the service is said to be lacking?", "Date": "April 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Get a Macbook Pro or new Macbook instead", "Author": "Lovethefuture", "ReviewID": "R3E42KFB3IM72T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Owned this model (Black Macbook) for 2 weeks.

I use it on the go, and as my desktop unit at home once I connect to a 24\" monitor and surround sound system.  I've had mine for about a year now, and it's been great. Solid performance, easy to upgrade, and of course, awesome with OS X.My only complaint is that they could have done better with the video chipset. I don't expect to run major 3D games, but I would like something that doesn't share system RAM. The Intel GMA is great for HD video (outputs quite nicely at 1080p) and everything you'd need in the GUI. What it lacks is in pushing major graphics, like advanced photoshop or video editing, and yes, in later-release games.With games, I just use my PS3, but for other things-- particularly virtualizing Windows- the shared RAM is a problem, and does slow things down when I'm doing too much at once.If gaming and major video work isn't your need, then the MacBook is the best laptop on the market.

My mistake. I admit that I did expect to find the change from Windows to Leopard (Mac OS X 10.5.4) a challenge. What I did NOT expect was that the support personnel at Apple would be so poorly trained that their help was almost useless. The standard solution after 2-3 hours on the phone was to reinstall the operating system. Big mistake. I downloaded Adobe, and it would not work properly on this laptop. I could no longer open simple pdf files. So, I called Apple support. Two hours later I was told to archive and reinstall the operating system. After doing that I still couldn't view pdf files, but finally used spotlight to find that there was still a small adobe file that needed to be deleted. That whole problem should have been a 5 minute phone call.  Unfortunately now  the printer would not work. Two more hours on the phone, and the \"support tech\" told me to remove the printer and then add it back. Bingo, the printer now worked. But again, more wasted hours. The next day I tried to access the Itunes store. Nope, couldn't do that either anymore. Three more hours on the phone, and I was told that it isn't possible to access the Itunes store from a managed account. Interesting that I have been doing just that for the past three months. Bottom line, don't expect decent support from Apple. If you buy a Macbook, you are really on your own. If you are familiar with Apple computers or have superior technical skills, you should do OK. But if you are coming over from Windows, you will only find frustration and misery. I will attempt to force Apple to take this thing back, and give me a refund. If that fails, I will try to find someone who still thinks that Apple is the greatest thing since sliced bread, and sell this MacBook to them!!!", "Date": "July 26, 2008"}, {"Title": "very cool", "Author": "Metha Apiwattanakul", "ReviewID": "R1BR1K337R0YRM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is very cool.

I purchased this due to my son wanting to use this for school and college next year.  We got it and he played around with it for a few weeks and then he was using his windows laptop and PC???So I get it and use it for about 2 weeks.  What a joke!  Overpriced hardware and software that works with nothing else.  For my work I have certain pieces of software that require windows.  OK so run Windows under the Mac OS and/or dual boot.  I did both and ended up working in windows for most of the time!So tell me why I overpaid for average hardware (I do not like the macbook keyboard layout at all) and then ended up running Windows XP on it most of the time?  Either needed software that was Windows only (blame my vendors that I work with) or needing Internet Explorer for my company and vendor's web sites to work properly.Unless you just want to surf the internet and write a few documents then skip the hype.  Also try enjoy trading files between the two OS's (must share via a FAT32 partition) or use some other tool.  I do not have one vender that uses Macs and maybe 1 client.  So if you like to think you are really smart and be on a differnet platform than most other people then get this.  Or save your money and run Linux on standard HW.Windows is not perfect, but neither is Apple and I will never make this mistake again.

I specify and recommend IT products to our many locations. I will no longer recommend Apple products based on my own personal experience. This laptop has given me nothing but issues over the 1+ year I owned it. I won't go over the minute details, but basically it was in for repairs at least 5-6 times to replace the battery, hard drive, random reboot, discoloration on the plastic, SuperDrive, etc.The last issue I had was just this week. The screen began to flicker constantly and I was about to take it to my local Apple store when my wife accidently spilled water on the keyboard. As I said before, the logic board (motherboard) was already defective before the spillage. Because of the water damage, even though I have AppleCare, the repair is not covered--Apple wants close to $1000 for parts/labor to repair a system that at this point, it's not even worth that anymore. I can't believe the Mac \"genius\" even suggested repairing it when a new unit costs that much.I have always been a big Apple fan for many years and have owned many of their products. I have bought and recommended Power Macs G4/G5, MacBooks/Pro, iMacs, CinemaDisplays, MacPros, you name it! Many of our locations complain about the premium price that our company pays for an Apple product as opposed to a Dell system.

No.On that Saturday evening, we received a confirmation of the order with a projected date of 1 Dec 08. I called immediately (this was still Saturday evening) and talked to telephone operator Lisa, but got the sad news that \"The order has already been processed.\" If I had known Amazon meant nine days when they said three, I would have ordered express overnight delivery. What's $20 more when you've just spent $1000?Since placing the order, I have talked to three Amazon telephone operators who, while pleasant, were completely unable to help. Then, after dangling on hold for 20 minutes, I talked with manager Kevin. He told me that \"three-day shipping\" means \"three to five days\". He explained, as had the three operators, that the only way to receive a computer before next Monday would be to give Amazon another $1000 plus the charge for overnight shipping and refuse the \"first\" order when it arrives.I know everybody has a sob story, but this MacBook was to replace a damaged computer for a blind woman.
