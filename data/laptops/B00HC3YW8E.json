I kept looking around on the market for a reasonable price laptop, nothing over $1,000 for my budget. Came across the HP Envy 17 and had my eyes on it for a few months. Windows 8 isn't much of a bother; very easy to adjust to.Extremely fast and so far no problems. Just bought Norton 360 2014 for it. I'd give it a 5-star rating.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Laptop!

It crashes constantly, and HP support is so frustrating it is unbelievable.  Make sure you check all the \"Automatic Repair Loop\" issues online before you purchase ANY Windows 8 HP laptop.

Note, the first thing I did was install Windows 7. The only problem with that install was wireless driver. There are two drivers on the website; but both are wrong. I think HP hasn't updated the drivers for 802.11AC laptops. Anyway, I used chat support, and the tech pointed me where to download the right driver which solved the problem right away. Also, if you install Windows 7, you need to change a setting in BIOS - the default is intended for Win8 only.Overall, I love it. The screen is large; it is light and the battery lasts very long. You may also enjoy dedicated numeric keyboard. Webcam is following the face, and it never gets jerky. I expected a lot from i7 CPU and 12GB of RAM, and I wasn't disappointed. Audio is very good - although I am not a big audiophile. USB ports are \"autosensing\" USB 2 and USB 3; it may be a problem if you are doing something esoteric, like booting from USB drive.If it is important to you, it doesn't have VGA post - not a big deal; but I learned it the hard way when I couldn't connect to a projector. And I was not able to make fingerprint driver work.All this for about $900 - sorry, my Mac friends - you are throwing money away!", "Date": "May 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazing Laptop", "Author": "Refuse to Lose", "ReviewID": "R2WOIOF9XCTTYT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just recently got the laptop and am pretty impressed with how fast and smooth it works.

Both took a beating and were running almost 24/7.  I completed 3 University degrees while working full time, and I wouldn't have made it through school without them.  The first 2 withstood being dropped a couple of times. Both were used 8-16 hours a day, and left on at night in sleep mode.  This one is much lighter, thinner, faster and much larger HD capacity than the 2 previous.  I am not a fan of Windows 8 or 8.1, but am liking it more as I use it.  I needed to replace my 2nd HP due to it being knocked off a table at work a few weeks ago.  It still works, but has major problems from the accident and is beyond repair. I expect this one to be as good or better than my previous 2 laptops from HP.  I got this one for far less money than either of my previous HP's. I use the new one as my primary computer, for both work at the University where I teach, and my private business off campus.  I'm completely sold on HP, has always been a good value for the money, and good quality for the money.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Keyboard stopped working in 3 weeks", "Author": "Rene Cardona", "ReviewID": "R2L3R5ZVZFN4CA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've had this type of Laptop in the past and I had wireless problems so I switched to Dell.

It's fast. It shuts down quickly and starts up rather quickly too.02. The laptop isn't make out of flimsy plastic. It makes it a bit more heavy, but I don't mind that since it means the laptop will withstand things.03. The display is superb.04. Thanks to the Cool Sense, the laptop runs cool, which is going to be nice once summer begins.05. The keyboard is quiet, which is nice when you have a roommate that claims they can hear you typing.06. The Beats Audio is awesome!CONS:01. The finger print function doesn't work that well.02. I had to buy a new router since the one I had was too old to communicate with the laptop.

Muskovitz \"joshm317\"", "ReviewID": "RBQHZX2VLAB6Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this when my four year old HP Pavilion DV7 started flaking out. This is the logical successor to that model.First, the good:- Compared to my previous AMD-based machine, this Intel CPU runs VERY quiet.- Windows 8.1 is fairly easy to get used to.- 12 GB of RAM should be enough for nearly anyone these days.- I use mine with a second display (via HDMI) and this works like a champ.- The touchpad is a bit sensitive, and I have to be careful not to accidently bump it, lest my cursor jump unexpectedly.- Beats audio is quite good, but not a huge amount of bass. This isn't a bad thing.Next, the neutral:- Not a huge amount of bloatware preinstalled. Free year of 3rd party anti-virus, but I uninstalled this in favor of Windows Defender, which is free and part of the OS.- The fingerprint reader works well, but it can be a little obnoxious when it offers to record your passwords for every website you visit.Finally, the bad:- 5400rpm for a modern hard drive is painfully slow. Horrifyingly slow. Agonizingly slow. Trust me, it's slow.But this isn't actually a real problem if you are willing to spend a little additional cash (and I highly recommend you do). Pick up a 250 or 500GB SSD (I went with the 500GB Samsung 840EVO) and a second drive bay caddy (which annoyingly doesn't come with the laptop). I got mine from newmodeus ([...]). It only takes removing the battery and one screw to access the drive bays.You install the SSD in the second bay, run the software that comes with it, clone your 1TB drive onto the SSD, swap the drives, and reformat your 1TB spinny drive. You will find your boot time drops to less than 20 seconds from power button to desktop, including logging in via the fingerprint reader. Everything will run TONS faster off the SSD, and you sill have a terabyte spinny disk for everything that can be run slowly -- think music, videos, photos, and such. I plan on using mine to hold backups of the SSD.All in all, a great performer for the price, except for the 5400rpm drive. With an SSD, it is an easy 5 stars.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "living God and his people", "Author": "Elenio", "ReviewID": "RRD4PPVZJJAAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "its awesome because its really fast.the only thing I dislike is the resolution of the screen I think I could be of highest quality and range", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your money", "Author": "MLPJ", "ReviewID": "R296YFOA5SQ57E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "From the very minute we received these it has had nothing but problems. locks up constantly. has no volume what's so ever. try to play a movie and you can forget about it. our $300.00 compact out performs this thing what a joke for a $ 1,000.00 no thank you", "Date": "April 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Avoid Windows 8.1", "Author": "Gary C Alexander", "ReviewID": "R3U1W3ZSUOK1CH", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I regret having bought this laptop, mainly due to the Win 8.1 OS, which is for tablets & smart phones.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "beats audio is crap", "Author": "pat", "ReviewID": "R2N2E92GN6FK6U", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "the speakers are wimpy.
