{"Reviews": [{"Title": "MY computer!", "Author": "apples2apples", "ReviewID": "R1KXRQW9VG3A1F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The HP G60-235DX is the laptop computer I'm on right now! I love this computer - it has 3 Gigs as opposed to the laptop I actually bought for myself - which has 4 gigs. But, it starts up in a flash - unlike the 4 Gig Lenovo. We have several laptops in our home because my husband has one for his work, I have one for mine, we have one we do most of our financial stuff and other important work on. Then our daughter in college has a laptop, and a couple for our other kids. We don't want our youngest running with one - which he does - so we also have to have a more inexpensive desktop.One of the things I love most about this computer is the feel - if you're familiar with computers, and know the feel of a Compaq as opposed to an HP, this one feels like a Compaq. I know Compaq is made by HP, but they truly do have a different feel.The keyboard is a little wider, so sometimes my fingers go to the wrong keys, but the keys are pretty effortless - not \"clicky\" like some keyboards. The shell is shiny black, but fingerprints aren't too bad, and the inside is a smooth fingerprint-less stainless color inside. Very sharp looking, a little bigger than our Lenovo, but a great sitting around the house computer. The feel is a little heavier than the Lenovo, but probably pretty standard for a computer this size.One thing we didn't like was that the spare battery quit working for some unknown reason about 3 months after we got it, and it was the battery this computer calls for. We didn't know the battery wasn't working except the computer just stopped working after a couple of months. I was so upset - we don't spend this kind of money only to have a computer stop working that quickly. My husband took it, and just happened to plug a Dell battery into it, and low and behold the computer worked! I was thrilled - I hadn't been able to use the computer in about a week! I'm so glad it was the spare battery and not the computer!Overall this is my favorite laptop....well...our daughter's is burgundy, and that would be so sweet, but despite the color, I do love this computer and would recommend it to anyone who was looking into purchasing a new laptop. The price was somewhere around $600 - our 4 Gig Lenovo was approx $650, so I guess the price is pretty standards.", "Date": "October 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "I love it (Please read for details pros and cons included)", "Author": "Makailah", "ReviewID": "R21DSO8F43AAFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I noticed there was no reviews that were recent, which had me hesitant to buy and it took forever for me to get the guts. It's pretty hard to find a decent review of it on youtube as well. So here it is : >So I bought this a few weeks ago, and was a little reluctant because i heard you wanna buy newer laptops and this one is not as old as most of the ones that were in my budget, but definitely not new and pristine like the ones that cost 500 and so. But it works actually really well for the age, i was afraid it'd be slow as hell but actually it's as fast as any newer one.Gaming:  now, i have yet to actually experience any lags in any of my games, but keep in mind I am not a gamer. So don't know about all that, but my friends are and they play some high up games that i sometimes download to see if it'll be good. so far, no issues. But it is probably not a good idea to buy this soley for gaming (ignoring everything else, the laptop con is it's heating issues, which occur most when your putting too much pressure on it) so yes it can play games fine, but if that's what your hoping to play 24/7 then you'll be disappointed because it WILL get too hot on you.Speed: First things first is it runs pretty fast with everything considering. Also, I can run a lot on it without lagging even once. Currently am running 5 tabs on firefox, one being a youtube video of nostalgia critic. Also running sai program and skype. I have yet to have any lag issues, which is awesome XD So for speed it's a plusGRAPHICS/ ART: What i was REALLY looking for while buying my laptop was a laptop i could do my art on. It works well for that as well, surprisingly i like it more then using my pc maybe because the screen is pretty bright and wide enough i can draw ok with my tablet. That being said, I still prefer using a mouse while i'm using my program, if only because i switch through the settings often, Nothing to do with the laptop, just a personal preference.TouchPad and Keyboard: Oh my god I love this touchpad, I'm not even going to go into too much detail, it's just freakin amazing. But this being said, all I really have to compare it to is my sister's laptop (netbook), and my aunts apple laptop (which is pretty thin and smallish too). So maybe it's different for regular sized laptops? Anyway, I love it because it's really smooth, my finger just glides on the surface XD I love that, and the fact that it reacts pretty well. That and it feels like the keys are placed just perfect, i can reach them with ease as i scroll and they aren't hard to push. Not too small not too big. Without a mouse I have no problem using the touchpad as a substitute, which..when i was thinking of getting a laptop, made me worry. Now the keyboard itself is pretty awesome, I like having the numer pad there (i see a lot of laptops don't). And so far typing on it is pretty easy and  nice, there is even on the side where the speakers are a light when the caps are on, which is reallly helpful because i've been having problems accidently pushing caps when i shouldn't (on my computer). It also does this with the num lock over the keyboard. My only complaint would be that they don't  light up. So if your in the dark you'll have to go by the light of the screen to see, though usually that's enough. But i'm pretty handy with a keyboard so light or no light i can type fine.Size and weight: Honestly, I don't move my laptop around very much, but i don't really have much to complain about. But being my first laptop I feel like i could break it by just picking it up. But that's just my stupid clumsy self, it has nothing to do with the laptop. For the wqeight and build it's pretty ok, nothing really loose about it which is nice : > The screen size i have is big and nice for a laptop, which is awesome too because well..i like to read my manga and watch some movies.Web cam and microphone: Ok..so...so far the web cam is ok. The one time my sis tried to use it on skype though it was acting sorta funky. But so was the other person's on the line, so that may just be an issue in skype or something. But during that the microphone seemed to work ok, they could hear each other. That being said the computer has a built in program for the webcam that works pretty awesome, a little slow with the camera so that if you were to move left you could actually count to two before it followed your movements. My cousin has a laptop that does the same thing, so i don't know if thats a real problem or not. But since I don't use the webcam much anyway..*revised: after testing the microphone it is defective, it's ok for a bit but then goes way ogg like i see many hp g60 series microphones are. But again since i don't use the microphone or webcam much it's not too bad a problem for me.But besides all that there is a con, and I mentioned it somewhat with gaming. It's something that bugs me a bit. It gets hot. Sometimes really hot, that it is uncomfortable to type on because as you touch it somewhat irritates your fingers. THANKFULLY it only happens occasionally and can cool down. Hopefully it's just somewhat dusty inside and once i clean it out i won't have this problem. Heating seems to be a common problem with a lot of laptops no matter what brand, so i'm not too perturbed.That aside, everything else is great :)i hope to save up soon to increase my ram.", "Date": "August 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Reliable Machine", "Author": "Amazon \"RXNS\"", "ReviewID": "RRAWO8XWPXXA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is reliable and intuitive.
