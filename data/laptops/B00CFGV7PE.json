{"Reviews": [{"Title": "My Sony Vaio 15.5", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R1CDGC90XI3WDZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from Fry's Electronics about 3 weeks ago and have loved everything about it. I am a pretty savvy person when it comes to electronics and computers so I definitely did my research before purchasing this. Coming from a desktop and having previously owned laptops, I needed something that could hold all my information and also operation at fast speeds too.So far, it have been a wonderful laptop even with Windows 8 and the \"glare\" on the touchscreen. Most laptops that are touchscreen seem to have a glare or maybe just Windows computers I have looked at. One issue I still need to deal with is the battery life as it seems to not last very long at all when you are using it for taking notes in class or just basic computing needs.Overall though, I do think this $1k was spent wisely with buying this computer and I am glad I did. Let's say it took me about an hour of being in the store deciding before I actually bought this so yeah, I was a bit nervous but I couldn't be happier.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love the laptop.  Windows 8 I'm not crazy about.", "Author": "Dharmadog \"Dharmadog\"", "ReviewID": "R1JSSM72GQW6BB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop, including the touchscreen, are great.  The touch pad/mouse is responsive and easy to use.  The laptop is fast.  The startup is as quick as they say it is in the advertising.  I really love the laptop.  Windows 8, though, is another story.  You can't just jump from Windows 7 to Windows 8 and make a smooth transition.  It is a whole different world.  My biggest complaint is that I have yet to figure out how to have multiple windows open on my screen at the same time.  The practical effect of this is most annoying when I am, for example, on my bank's website and I want to pull up the calculator to do some math.  In Windows 8, I haven't figured out how to do that (and I have tried).  So far, in fact, I haven't seen any advantages whatsoever to making the jump to Windows 8 and, if I had it to do over again, I would get a laptop with Windows 7.......although I really do like this laptop a whole lot.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best laptop i had", "Author": "Elsevilla", "ReviewID": "R2UO02HHBJOKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was surprised to see it can handle Photoshop and Painter X3 with no lag at all, windows starts abit slow but once its open the magic starts. The cool sony software included its awesome for editing videos, specially if you are a digital artist and want to edit recorded painted sessions.I had read people complains and most of them are a bit idiotic. It seems people dont read specifications anymore. Its their fault they didnt read right in the first place. People complaining that screen its reflective its because it has  a glossy screen, it needs to have a nice plastic glass to protect the led from your fingers.People complainign that didnt had enough usb ports, it has enough for me to plug the wacom and extra attachments, people complaining about this are dumd, read specs in the first place.Colors are good on this laptop i was surprised, it doesnt have a good angle like modern ips monitos with more of 170 degress, but it gives you at least 100, especially horizontally, but vertically color shifts a bit, but once you know where to look, you wont have any trouble, i was surprised to see that colors were similar to my profesional cintiq and othe rprofessional dell monitor.Its not the best monitor but colors are not horrible.If you have experience with glossy monitors, you can work prefectly in a room with no lights at the back.In my model came with lights on keyboard, i recomend to make sure your claptop have this, because you will need to be in dark rooms and you need to see your text if you want to see optimal colors onlaptop, on normal daylight it works, all depends on illumination of your room.BEST OF ALL it wont heat up, after a day of use i was surprised it didnt heat up on my desk, also the eliminator box its not that big and doesnt heat up either, my desktop makes more noise than this one, i mean i had volume in 10% and i can even low it more like 5% and still hear videos of youtube because the fan makes no sound at all.My version came with 6 gig of ram and photoshop and painter x3 works like a charm.Im not sure about other people that had problems, but maybe its because of new drivers or not, but my touch screen works like a charm, after downloading the app of netflix its a pleasure to move scrolls.The touch screen saves you TONS  of time, because its easy to move the cursor, saves you tons of time.The design is slim, and looks gorgeous, i got the white version.Battery its really small, you will get battery life like 3 and almost 4 hours of use, but for the size i got no problem. Also it has an nvidia one gig video card for 3d and uses intel for other stuff.I plug it onmy tv and i was surprised how easy the lapto connected to the screen.The sound its gorgeous on this laptop, sounds really really good, and loud.Im in love with the NFC options, i got an experia phone, and when i combine this two its like magic, goodbye cables.No need to install music on laptop you can conect it by blutooth after activating them and share music so easy, so more space for projects and personal works.This is not a rare product, so you can go localy and see it in a store, ask all questions you like, see the screen, look at the usb conections, and dont become one of these people that didnt took 5 minutes to read specifications, this is a solid laptop.I will buy it again.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sony VAIO Fit Series SVF15218CXW 15.5-Inch Core i7 Touch Laptop", "Author": "carrot0607", "ReviewID": "RP4JOJGSC2NB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was the one which I really want to choose.

I would not buy it again.  At first I thought it was Windows 8 that was the source of the problem, and maybe some of the issues are related to that, but some of them are the hardware.Wireless connection is AWFUL - in the same room as another laptop (Lenovo) this computer's connection is about 30% slower and drops constantly! The other computer and the wireless Roku have NO issues, so it's not the router/connection it's THIS computer.Touch pad/mouse - just awful, barely useable as a mouse - the distinction between 'right' and 'left' click is way over on the side. For someone who is a power user of right click menus and opening things in new windows - not so good. This is not a Win 8 issue as I've been on other laptops running Win 8 without this problem.Freezes and Crashes quite often and/or does not 'wake up' - same programs and content as on my old laptop and yet I have far more freezes and crashes that require hard re-boot on this computer. Sometimes the mouse still works, but everything else is frozen. Ctl+Alt+Delete does nothing. This *may* be Win 8, but I have Win 8 running on a Dell at work and never have this issue. It is not unusual to come back to the computer after several hours and have it not wake up - just stuck on a black screen, hard reboot required.Slow to boot up given its a 'solid state' - I was looking forward to faster boot times with solid state, there is barely any difference and when you factor in how much more you are rebooting due to freezing and losing the wireless connection overall time saved on booting computer - negative.Touch/Screen - it's ok, I'm not an app user or big internet surfer, more a word, excel, one note, visio etc user so its not a 'feature' for me. What I don't like is the shiny of the screen - its distracting to see my reflection all the time. The other user who mentioned its like a mirror is only exaggerating slightly.USB ports - too few of them.Software/device compatibility - this is Win 8's issue, but I'll mention it since that is what you get if you buy this computer.  My 3 year old HP printer and 4 year old nikon camera could not be made to work with this computer. I tried for hours. I want to buy a new color printer, but it seems like many are having issues getting them to work with Win 8 so for now I transfer stuff to the old Win 7 computer to print. PITA.Power connector/cable - its not super tight the cord falls out frequently.*Pros -- Why its getting 3 stars instead of less*- Super light weight- Nice to look at/pretty- Keyboard has nice touch/easy to use (other than the horrible touchpad/mouse)- When its not crashing and freezing it's pretty fast at opening closingWin 8 or Win Hate as I call it - I would give this ZERO STARS- I really really wish I had done more looking around to find a Win 7 laptop with the specs I wanted. When Vista came out, Dell kept building XP computers that folks could by for an extra fee. Hopefully they will start building new Win 7's soon and as much as I am not a fan of Dell, Windows 8 is such a wacko POS I will be moving over. I need a computer to WORK. I don't need a apps to every BS company MS decided to broker a deal with! If I want netflix I will go there, I don't need it pre-installed. I need access to my files, to be able to use REAL programs without having to wade through a bunch of shit that belongs on a phone or tablet.

This has been one of the worst choices I've ever made.I brought the computer in twice since buying it to have it serviced. First, the computer refused to acknowledge my external hard drive. Then it failed to recognize ANY internet connections, even though all other devices in the house continued to work, and finally the touch screen stopped responding. This morning, the internet again was not connecting, so I restarted the computer, only to have a black screen. When I called SONY to troubleshoot, they told me that it needed to be reset to factory settings. All my music, pictures, information, documents are gone, and I need to struggle through three more years with this worthless thing. My Mac lasted 6 years without incident, and this PC can't even make it 20 days???In addition, the computer has several annoying quirks even when it is operating at its best. If you leave your fingers on the touchpad, it will zoom in and out at speeds that do not allow you to choose what size you'd actually like.  It will open up internet explorer if you leave your fingers on the touchpad as well.  It will drop the internet connections repeatedly (look it up! It's a major reported bug cited on several leading tech sites), and the constant updating interferes with apps.TL;DR: NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!!

Keyboard has a true num-key pad. Sleek design. Small portable charger. Speakers are impressive for a laptop.Cons: ultra high glare touchscreen is more mirror than monitor. The glass on the screen makes the monitor heavier than the keyboard, which causes the laptop to tip easily. Noisy fan. Poor GPU performance.

It took more over three hours on the line with impatient technicians just to get it marginally functioning.-Slow to boot up-SLOW to shut down--the first fit shutdowns, tech support (more on this soon) got tired of waiting after 20 minutes and just had me crash the computer. Since then, I've successfully shut it down once and have had to crash it another four times.-This might be the OS and not the VAIO, but when a program or window is selected, it usually takes several attempts before it works (as in, if you leave it, nothing will happen. You have to prod it like an errant teenager)-VAIO has issues installing its own updates--it will begin install, and at about 95%, fail. A technician got it to finally finish, but when I rebooted, it said the update was installed incorrectly and needed to be done once again-Touchscreen is not very responsive-Less than a week with this laptop and it is making clicking soundsAnd all throughout, tech support has been very curt and only marginally helpful. Hoping these are just growing pains...or the laptop just crashes in the next day or two so Sony can replace before warranty is up, because all these are issues right out of the box.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is the worst computer ever!", "Author": "Doug Albert", "ReviewID": "RB5IO3MMK5TAG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This computer hasn't worked from the first day.
