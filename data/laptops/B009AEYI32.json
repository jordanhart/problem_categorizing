{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An Almost Perfect Laptop", "Author": "Will C.", "ReviewID": "R1E4VU1IP7YNPY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're someone who prefers Windows over OS X, then you've probably identified the Asus UX51VZ as a potential windows-competitor to the Apple Macbook Pro Retina. My wife has the MBPr, so I have had some experience with it. While Asus gets most things right, I think it falls a little bit short in the hardware department. But don't get me wrong, this is a great laptop.Things this laptop gets right:The combination of full-powered CPU and dedicated graphics card give it enough power to game (although I don't game myself)They laptop looks very good, and is both thin and light3x USB 3.0 Ports is great for data transfer speeds; I don't need thunderbolt at this point8GB RAM needs to be more common in thin laptops (can be upgraded to 12GB)They keyboard is great to type on and the trackpad is the best I've used on any Windows laptop (doesn't match Apple trackpads, but comes close)This display is terrific. There aren't many options out there for people who want a thin laptop with a nice IPS display. It's also matte, which is a huge plus over the MacBook Pro Retina (and it's actually the #1 benefit over the MBPr I think - aside from running windows natively). Color gamut may not satisfy the most professional photographer, but you can hook it up to an external monitor for that (although, see con below).Things where this laptop fails:The fan never turns off! The idle fan noise is very annoying and it's something that Asus needs to fix ASAP. In my book, if Asus just fixes this issue, then this laptop goes from a 4 to 5 star laptop. I hope they have every engineer at their disposal working on this issue.I am not sure why this laptop has a mini-VGA instead of a mini-DisplayPort connector. The future is in high-resolution monitors. The HDMI is limited to 1080p. Right now there is nothing on this laptop to support my 30\" Dell Ultrasharp at its highest resolution which is very disappointing. I hope Asus gets this right in the futureThere is no kensington lock on this laptop. When I'm working in a coffee shop I like to be able to lock up my laptop and not worry about it when I go to the restroom. I realize this is a small request, but it's surprising that it wasn't included.It's clear that this laptop is a great one if you're shopping the thin + light premium laptop category. If Asus could just fix those couple of missteps (namely the fan noise issue and add a mini-DisplayPort) then this laptop would be absolutely perfect.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Run with the big dogs while looking like a champ.", "Author": "R. L. Morrow \"Rob Himself\"", "ReviewID": "R5T3LHG8O6194", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started researching replacements for my 15\" unibody MacBook Pro in October '12. I wanted a similar form factor that preserved some of the things I'd grown attached to from Apple: great screen, responsive touchpad, and chiclet keys with great tactile response. I also wanted to massively upgrade. My MBP was top dog of its line when it was new, and the MBPr looks good, but only comes with a limited amount of video RAM. At minimum, I wanted: quad-core i7, 8GB RAM, SSD primary drive, nVidia dedicated graphics w/ 2GB video RAM. 1080p screen resolution was a must. Fit, finish, and materials had to be premium. I've never been too concerned with battery life, so in that regard I just wanted to maintain what I'd become accustomed to with the MBP. I'm notoriously difficult to shop for, and I'm exceptionally picky. After a month of searching high and low I began worrying that what I wanted simply didn't exist, and began worrying that I'd need to start making concessions. My wife has a Republic of Gamers ASUS laptop that looks like Batman's Tumbler vehicle. I can't stand the looks of it, but the performance was hard to ignore. Just before my purchase, I happened upon the u500 series from ASUS. On paper, I was sold. After a couple of weeks of research, some hands-on experience with the other ASUS Zenbooks, and lots of consideration, I made the purchase.I. First ImpressionsI'm a big fan of presentation, and ASUS didn't disappoint. The unboxing experience is satisfying, and as a gadget lover this is one of the best parts of getting a new \"toy.\" Attractive packaging and creative boxing.Bootup times are crisp and smart: 5-7 seconds when plugged in, with a couple of seconds extra on battery power. Installing software, browsing, and word processing happen nearly instantaneously; extremely fast. I play a few games: Counter-Strike GO, Minecraft, and World of Warcraft. All of them look excellent at maximum settings, and the nVidia card offers great performance in such a small package. One MINOR gripe: with maxed settings, there's just a LITTLE screen-tearing. It's almost unnoticeable, and I suspect it's more an issue with the screen than the rest of the machine. I'm also a web and software developer, and the screen offers a very pleasurable reading and writing experience. Text is very crisp; very sharp. All in all, I have zero regrets about my purchase. It does exactly what I want, and does so in a super sleek and sexy package. It's a powerhouse, and turns heads as soon as you open it.II. Windows 8I dislike Windows 8. There's no Start button, so without installing an add-on (more on this in a minute), it's necessary to go back and forth with the tiled interface. If the ASUS had a touchscreen, this might be a different take. If you're buying a version of this model in the UK or Australia, I hear this laptop not only has a touchscreen, but also comes with an external USB drive. Neither of these is the case for US models, so Windows 8 is pretty pointless. Feel free to point out all of the nifty new features under the hood that makes Windows 8 better than its predecessor, but if the first layer of user experience is more a hindrance than a help, it doesn't really matter what's going on behind the scenes. I installed the small add-on Start8 almost immediately after figuring out that I hated the default Windows 8 interface. It's a $4.99 purchase from the Stardock company, and it's phenomenal. Is Windows 8 usable without the Start button and a touchscreen? Sure, but it's painfully obvious that Microsoft did not intend it. Before installing a spare copy of Windows 7, if you have one, do yourself a favor and give Start8 a try. There's a 30-day demo, but you'll only need an hour to love it.III. BloatwareThere's not a lot, but it's present. The usual crappy Norton trial is included, as is Office Starter edition. Windows 8 comes with an option to reinstall a completely barebones installation; don't bother. The bloatware will still be there after startup. Apparently, \"barebones\" installation still includes whatever subsidized garbage the manufacturer wishes to include. Thankfully, it only takes about five minutes to uninstall the garbage.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "beautiful laptop", "Author": "A. Torres", "ReviewID": "RQED5200IN7W0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think the first review of this laptop is written very well, and I agree on many points. Since they have corrected the fan noise with BIOS 203, and since the Kensington lock is not an issue for me, nor is needing touchscreen, it is as perfect a laptop as one can get.The sound is amazing, one of the best in speaker quality I have heard.The display is top notch. The GPU is what I was looking for, a game worthy card. Having that on an i7 with 8GB of RAM, and an SSD, with three USB 3 ports, this doesn't lack for anything on my list. I understand the price is high, but anything in the 1000-1500 range comes with serious compromise--only 4GB of RAM, a spinning HDD, an Intel HD 4000 onboard card. I wouldn't have any of that at this stage, and could not find anything with those specs in a light (sub 3 lbs), thin \"ultrabook\". When you need those specs in a light, slick-looking package, suddenly the $2000 range is what you end up looking at.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Very Best", "Author": "Christopher Bart \"Coloradobanjo\"", "ReviewID": "R3EQYGT3BOWVKV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned many Dell Computers, and during my years as a Network Engineer, I configured and installed hundreds more. They had been my choice for many years after Sony stopped supporting the VIAO line with good driver updates, etc. My last Dell worked well enough, but it had a lot of plastic parts, it shipped with a scraping cooling fan, and the bezel cracked quite quickly. This put me in mind that I would shop elsewhere for my next computer.Asus had been my favorite motherboard for desktop builds, and I never had trouble with one. When I learned that they were making laptops, I was interested. I read other reviews where people talked about cooling fan noise, but this seemed silly to me. This particular Zenbook is a very compact, very powerful unit, and it made sense to me that it might run the fan most of the time, which it does. I live high in the Colorado Rockies in a secluded location, and the fan noise has never been an issue at all.The decals that others complained about came off in five minutes with a little nail polish remover (acetone,) Kleenex, and my fingernail. The touch-pad is indeed large and sensitive, and I do sometimes find that I have brushed it unintentionally. However, Function-F9 toggles the pad off and on for extended typing. I don't know what anyone else was expecting from a big well-made touch-pad. The recovery time from sleep mode is blazingly fast; just a few seconds, and it will stand by in that fast mode for a week or more.I hate Windows 8 as much as anyone else, but a company called Stardock software makes a little program that gives you back your start button and all that it offers. This cost five bucks (really!)This computer is not only the finest I have ever owned, it is one of the prettiest pieces of equipment I have ever owned. The shipping carton is even beautiful. I thought the sub-woofer would be a silly item, but it works surprisingly well. With companies like Dell seeming to fall on their sword, I am happy to have my money going to a company so clearly anxious to earn it.This computer does not have a touch-screen.After two months of ownership, this gets my highest ever rating.", "Date": "July 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop! Best 15'' Ultrabook on the market", "Author": "darius carter", "ReviewID": "R1BAKX4VTSZ3CF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:This is by far the best laptop that I've owned. I consider myself a gadget hound so when I find something that I can say that I'm good with for a few years that says a lot. The boot times are awesome (5-7 cold boot). Speedy i7 performance and great GPU. I play skyrim and a few other intense 3D games on high setting and it runs like butter. The screen is gorgeous, love the matte finish. Keyboard is great for typing nice and comfortable. Track pad is great and the gestures make using windows 8 a little more satisfying. The build quality is unmatched besides apple. This is the macbook pro evil cousin. Heat dissipation is good, bottom get hot during intense gaming sessions but not too hot that I feel like I might feel like I might loose my ability to procreate.Audio is good and even better with the sub woofer.Cons:The battery led indicator is on the side by the AC input port and it extremely dim. I would have like to see something on the front to see if the battery is charged or not rather looking around on the side.The 10 key is a little cramped, even though I don't use it often but just a little nitpickOverall I highly suggest this laptop for someone who want a great looking ultra-book but don't want to sacrifice performance", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "I love this laptop", "Author": "N. Martens", "ReviewID": "R2Y0VL5N20KH0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having used this laptop nearly daily for the past seven months or so (since late November 2012), I, without hesitation, can recommend it as an option for anyone interested in a machine that balances portability and performance. Since several reviews already exist, I will try not to be redundant, but rather, to offer some insight into the less-covered aspects of the device. Let me also offer this disclaimer: if I seem at times to be overly enthusiastic, I apologize, but I really do love this computer.I use the device mainly for editing word documents, taking notes in class, browsing the internet, checking email, etc., but I also do some video editing and moderate gaming. Under lighter usage, the computer runs cool and efficiently, offering upwards of 7 hours of battery life. The computer runs games and other graphics intensive programs well, but it does get rather hot under heavier usage. Even though the touchpad and keyboard remain relatively cool, I definitely recommend using a laptop-cooling pad for gaming or video editing.Having done as much typing as I have over the past few months (I am a college student!), I can say that the keyboard is very sturdy and comfortable to use--adequate spacing and key travel, no loose or squeaking keys. I also really appreciate that ASUS included a number pad, which is especially useful for editing spreadsheets and doing general computations. I do agree somewhat with one of the previous reviewers on the sharpness of the edge of the computer around the palm rest. Depending on your posture relative to the machine (i.e., the height at which the computer keyboard sits relative to your elbows), the front edges of the computer can cause some discomfort in the forearm/wrist during typing. However, I do not find this to be much of a problem because I usually place the computer on my lap or on an angled dock on my desk, such that my forearms do not rest on the laptop.The 1920 x 1080 IPS display has excellent contrast, and text appears sharp and is especially pleasing to read on the matte screen, even under harsh lighting (reminiscent of reading from my Kindle, in a way, albeit the display technology is different). Indeed, I do not think that I will ever purchase another computer without a matte display! Yes, there is some light bleed around the edges of the screen, but it is only noticeable when I am viewing a completely black image (in essence, only when the computer is booting up).The touchpad is large and smooth. As to its usability, I have to say that the touchpad has become increasingly responsive and precise with successive iterations of the drivers that ASUS has released since I bought the computer (as one would hope/expect, right?). Although the touchpad was somewhat finicky at first, it now works very well, which is important because it is fundamental to gesture operation in Windows 8, especially in the absence of a touchscreen.Speaking of Windows 8 and touchscreens, one might ask whether I miss having a touchscreen in what is a seemingly touch-oriented operating system. My opinion is that, on such a large device, reaching across the keyboard to interact with the screen would be a bit unwieldy (or perhaps I am just lazy!). For example, my mother has a 13.3-inch touch-enabled Windows 8 laptop. While manipulating content via the touchscreen on her smaller device is natural and convenient, the screen is also considerably closer to the user, i.e., you do not have to reach as far to touch it.My one and only major peeve with the computer is that SD cards do not sit flush with the edge of the computer when inserted. Since I expected to use a 128 GB card as a more-or-less permanent expansion to storage, the card jutting out of the computer disappointed me.The audio quality on this machine is simply first-rate for a laptop. I have never been able to use any of my high-end earphones with a computer (Macs included) without an attenuator or portable amplifier, as the audio output and distortion/noise have always been uncomfortably high. However, with the UX51VZ, I can finally use my earphones directly with my laptop, which is a double boon because the audio processing via the included Waves MaxxAudio software is fantastic, especially when coupled with lossless audio files. The sound through the laptop's built-in speakers is no less stunning (again, for a laptop). With MaxxAudio and the placement of the speakers on the device, the spatial resolution of the music is phenomenal: songs are immersive and vibrant. The laptop also comes with a mini external subwoofer that lends a fuller, richer sound to the audio. To be fair, I still prefer to use my earphones, headphones, or other external speakers for listening, but I never imagined that such audio quality was possible from a laptop's speakers!By far, the UX51VZ is the best computer that I have ever used. Fast, sleek, and portable, it is a superbly crafted device as well as a pleasure to use.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great light laptop", "Author": "Wendy S. Weingart", "ReviewID": "R1WIEMHH9WBRHR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop in spite of some misgivings based on the negative comments of other writers.  The guy who bashed Windows 8 was ridiculous (because his problems were with Windows 8, not this machine), but I was concerned about the edges mentioned by the other writer.  After using the machine for two weeks, I have to say that I have no idea what he is talking about. I find it very comfortable to use. My only complaint about the machine is that the trackpad, which like all Windows trackpads is somewhat jerky and unreliable--though it's actually better than the one on my Sony Vaio (which it replaced).  I actually love the ability to tap the trackpad rather than being required to press/click it to perform an operation.  I should also add that the first thing I did was upgrade to Windows 8 Pro, which I think is more stable and I have had no trouble running it in classic (Windows 7) mode (I will never get used to the tiles in Windows 8, but even if I could, this is not a touchscreen, so it is not made for Windows 8).Aside from those items, this machine is fast, it boots up in less than 10 seconds and recovers from a snooze in two.  It plays HD video just fine.  Most important for me:  the video card can run two monitors at 2560 x 1440 resolution, and the display itself is just beautiful.  At 4 pounds, it's not too heavy to carry in a brief case, and I've been getting a little over four hours of intensive work on a charge--good enough for everywhere I need to go, though it would have been nice if they'd used a user-replaceable battery.

The performance is almost at a gaming PC level.  For a laptop so light and sleek the power they stuff into this thing is really amazing.  The discreet graphics can run just about any game out today at normal settings with little hicup.  Granted it still is a laptop and does have some performance limitations a gaming desktop wouldn't have but little I can notice (it will lag a little when really pushed hard during a long gaming session).  The style, and feel of this laptop is great.  The keyboard is backlit and keys are very responsive.  Although I do suffer from some cursor jumping once in a blue moon.The reason why I can not give this laptop 5 stars is due to the power connection on the laptop.  This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen in a laptop ever.  Whoever designed this should be fired immediately and never participate in engineering again.  The power cord is designed so poorly that is pushes itself out of the connection on its own constantly.  It is also so easy to knock it out yourself being that it has nothing to hold onto (no magnet, or even a latch or friction or anything to keep it from falling out).  This is super annoying because i constantly get notified the power cable has slipped out and I am constantly stopping what I'm doing to put it back in.

Ordered it off of a customization site with 12 GB RAM, and there's no denying it: this laptop is a superpowered beast that puts a lot of desktops to shame. After 10 months of heavy use as my primary development laptop, it still gets roughly 4.5 hours of battery life on a full charge, and has enough processing power to handle pretty much anything I manage to throw at it. Its very solidly built - I've definitely bumped it against more than a few poles in subway stations, and its no worse for the wear. Huge screen, good battery life, awesome processing power, excellent keyboard, and its thin and light to boot.The only issues I've had with it:1) The track pad is a bit left of center, which takes some getting used to. Its a perfectly valid design choice given the keyboard layout, but it did throw me off when I first got it.2) The massive screen can be a bit of a weakness sometimes. I'm a big guy and the laptop is too big for me to angle the screen as I would like when I'm on an NJ Transit train or on a plane, I have to sit at a 45 degree angle to open it up.3) I've had some minor issues with the Windows 8 wifi dialog - in Windows 8, there is only one dialog which allows you to connect to wifi, and there have been a couple days where the dialog would simply refuse to open no matter how much I tried to coax it to.

Wound up returning it. Terrible palm rest and toupad, sluggish performance.", "Author": "TJW \"Tim Weichman\"", "ReviewID": "R1UPVBTQQKHMCI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Background: I'm a mechanical engineer by trade. Actually worked for 4 years at one of the big U.S. computer manufacturers.In December my Dell Inspiron blew up, so I went on a frantic search to find a replacement. When it comes to shopping -- especially for things like computers and cars -- I go pretty overboard on the research. For me, everything matters - performance, reliability, fit, finish, display quality, bloatware, etc., etc., not to mention the feel of the keyboard, pointing device, and palm rest. The company that I work for basically gave me a blank check to get any system I wanted.Keep in mind my usage scenario is mainly Website development (coding and design). So that means I always have a ton of programs open at once - graphics software, Web development programs, tons of browser windows, Excel, Word, OneNote, Outlook, video editors, project management software, etc., etc. Anywhere from 30-80 windows open at a time.After a ton of online and in-store research, I settled on this exquisite little beauty. It really is a work of art -- by far the most beautiful PC laptop I'd come across.Now, I wasn't able to try this one out in the store. No one in my area had one. So I gambled and ordered one from B&H; Photo just based on online reviews and testimonials. (their return policy is exceptional, btw)The first thing you'll want to know is that performance is mediocre. I got it maxed out on HDD space and RAM, and even so, it was noticeably sluggish. The low-wattage processor just doesn't perform well enough if your usage scenario is CPU-intensive. But there's more to it than that -- even having just a couple office programs open the machine was still slow to respond. Don't expect that crisp, lightning-fast program response times that you might imagine from a brand new machine. The mobile processor just can't do it.The second thing that drove me crazy was the sharp edge on the palm rest - the very front edge that your palms/wrists hang over. It knifes into your palm/wrist, and creates unbearable pressure-point indentations. It actually gets to the point where it feels like you're being burned (even though the edge is very cool). On this one ergonomics point alone, I would have had to return the machine. I don't know how anyone could stand to work on the machine for more than maybe half an hour.One other thing related to that last point. Be wary of the photos used to highlight the thinness of this machine. Some of them are shot in such a way so as to hide its 2nd-level of thickness. The reason I gambled on this one in the first place was because the key photos I was using to judge the palm rest comfort didn't show just how far off the desk the palm rest really sat (the extra thickness makes the pressure point problem I mentioned all the worse).But what totally crippled this machine was the touchpad. It's horrible. Inadvertent mouse movement, clicks, and drag-and-drops happen all the time. It's astounding that a manufacturer would ship a system with this kind of defective design. The thing is, the majority of the PC laptops that use the Mac-style touchpahd design have similar problems. The only all-in-one, Mac-style touchpad that worked in any of the PC's I tested was the 14\" HP Envy. (I needed a 15\", otherwise I would have gotten that one).There was one other thing that really didn't sit well with me, and that's the built-in battery. When it eventually wears down, which you can rest assured it will, the only way to replace it is to send it back to the manufacturer. I called ASUS and their turn around time is 2 weeks or longer. So make sure you have a plan for that.I ended up returning this system and going with an HP DV6-7000t. So far, after 1-1/2 months, a pretty good system - though it never would've been my first choice. It retains the two-button style touchpad instead of using the Mac integrated style, which is awesome. Even with that I still have to disable the tap-to-click feature for the touchpad to avoid errant mouse-clicks. Trying to get pre-sales information from HP is ridiculous. Their sales people aren't trained to answer technical/performance questions. It's almost laughable. I ordered from a company who sells through Amazon (Eluktronics) - they specialize in HP's and Lenovo's. Expert-level consulting and excellent service.Feel free to comment if you have questions about either machine (the ASUS or the HP).", "Date": "February 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "childish Windows 8 and poorly assembled, not for pro users.", "Author": "Cedric", "ReviewID": "R32UCUARGFJKWW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "If your looking for a professional laptop, move along. Despite its great specs and its price this laptop runs the worst OS I ever saw: Windows 8.

The whole thing redundant with the original desktop, which is exists.This thing will block you and require more clicks and navigation to get the work done. It's a wall and you'll want to bang your head against it.
