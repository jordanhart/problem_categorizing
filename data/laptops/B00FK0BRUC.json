{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ghosting / image retention display problems and low build quality!", "Author": "J. Proctor", "ReviewID": "R1V5JBNRRPX8BQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "First, a warning to those who have bought or are considering buying a Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga: there is a known problem with the LG 12.5 FHD displays that Lenovo uses for these which causes the screens to start retaining images (similar to burn-in like CRTs used to suffer) anywhere from a few days to a couple of months after first use. If you haven't bought one yet, DO NOT until Lenovo has admitted the problem and addressed it. It appears to be common to ALL of the displays, with some suffering more than others. If you have already bought one, return it if you are within your return window. If not, contact Lenovo with the issue, post on their forums [...]  and don't relent until the issue has been addressed and resolved. These same displays were used by Dell in the XPS 12 model, and the same exact problem occurred. Dell initially denied it (as is Lenovo, saying it's within operating parameters), but they eventually capitulated and are now replacing all of the screens in the near future with a supposed LG revision. Some peoples monitors are being replaced now (by both Dell and Lenovo), but the new monitors are still showing problems with image retention.This is a huge problem that fundamentally flaws the display. To read more about it, check out the Lenovo forum thread about it here  [...] or on the Notepad Review forum post here [...] . All specs of the Thinkpad Yoga appear to be effected. Either of those threads will also inform you how to check for ghosting on your display if you haven't already noticed it.My unit is almost brand new (got it less than a week ago), and already the Start button is being retained almost immediately after starting the computer. It hasn't gotten worse yet to affecting the center of the screen, but it's only a matter of time.Another major issue I have with the ThinkPad Yoga is the build quality of my unit. The ThinkPad line is renown for their durability, build quality, solid construction, and tight functionality. However, my ThinkPad Yoga exhibits a lack of these qualities. The bottom of the screen, down by the Windows button all the way out to the hinges, is super creaky and flexes a lot. This is disconcerting and very distracting when trying to use the Windows button. The screen literally parts from the screen housing, which in turn parts from the hinge anytime I put a little pressure on it. Not ideal, considering it's a touch screen meant to be touched.Additionally, the chassis itself CREAKS, which is really surprising to me. All of the reviews of this unit say that the chassis is solid with no creaking or flex. I'm wondering if the reviewers used the unit for more than 2 or 3 days, or if I'm just the unlucky one. My unit has substantial creak and flex in the bottom right corner (all around the ThinkPad logo). This is a really problematic area, as it is where my wrist rests while I'm typing. Everytime I go to use the keyboard, CREEEAAKKKCREAKCREAK. Putting pressure down (or letting off) results in noise and flex. Picking up the laptop by the front left corner does the same. This is absurd, considering that this is a $1000 ThinkPad. Even the Yoga 2 Pro (consumer line, not as well known for its solid construction) is more solidly built and has zero creak in the chassis. That's very disappointing, and I suspect it points to another fundamental flaw with the chassis design (probably related to how they incorporate the locking/rising keyboard).These two problems (image retention and build quality) are my biggest qualms with this unit, and they are absolute deal breakers. I will be returning the unit soon. I wouldn't be upset about this, however, if there weren't redeeming qualities of the ThinkPad Yoga that I actually really, really like.So, on to a few positives.The ThinkPad Yoga lives up to the hype about the keyboard. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind, this is the best laptop keyboard I've ever typed on (not just ultrabook, but laptop!). It's got great travel, a wonderful resistance and tactile response, and is an absolute pleasure to use. This is really important to me, as I'll be typing research papers with this device pretty frequently.Additionally, despite grumbling from the long time ThinkPad users who are resistant to change, I really love the touchpad. Everyone absolutely drools and purrs about the Apple touchpads, but having used both, I have to be honest and say that I really prefer the ThinkPad Yoga touchpad. It is the best touchpad I've had the pleasure of using on a laptop. The click is substantial and responsive; firm but precise. The touchpad itself is precise and accurate. The clicking mechanism is easy and equally performed from anywhere on the pad (versus Apple touchpads, where the clicking gets harder the closer you get to the keyboard/backside of the touchpad). This makes it forgiving and never unpleasant. Just solid, tactile clicks every single time.Additionally, I think the combo of 12.5\" display and FHD (1080p) makes a TON of sense. It's much more sane and universally usable than the Yoga 2 Pro's 3200x1800 at 13.3\", and yet it is super crisp and clean looking. If only another manufacturer would put out 12.5 FHD screens (Samsung, I'm looking at you!) and Lenovo would use them . . .The battery life is OK, at around 6 hours or so for me (including heavy web browsing, watching some videos on Hulu and Netflix, and even playing Minecraft, which this does really well!). I'd love better battery life like the Macbooks get, but it's more than adequate for my uses. The sound is good enough for watching shows or playing games casually, although I'd want headphones for music, movies, or serious gaming (who is doing that on an ultrabook?!?). The weight is a little bit more than I'd like ideally, but I'm willing to have it if the tradeoff is solid construction and durability (which it appears it is NOT).All things considered, the Lenovo ThinkPad has a lot of great qualities that make it an excellent ultrabook in theory. If it were problem free, it would easily be my laptop of choice. However, it is fundamentally flawed by a massive display problem that appears to be affecting the entire production. This makes it an absolutely nonviable laptop (unless you're OK plunking down $1000+ on a broken display). Additionally, the build quality on my unit is absolutely lacking, and I can confirm that many other units share at least the screen creaking and flex problem. This is another widespread strike that really detracts from the ThinkPad name. If this were a $700 non-ThinkPad computer, I would still be upset about this build quality, but I wouldn't be as surprised. For it to be a $1000+ ThinkPad is unacceptable.In my wildest dreams, Lenovo would read all of these problems and issue a new ThinkPad Yoga using an entirely different display and with much higher build quality tomorrow! But of course, if these issues are addressed at all, it is likely to be on the scale of months, maybe years, not days. I've only got weeks to return my unit, so my future with a ThinkPad Yoga is no good. I will absolutely hate to give up the amazing keyboard and touchpad, as well as the great 12.5\" FHD display setup, but this computer is unsuitable and unacceptable. Shame, Lenovo. You teased me and then majorly disappointed.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good machine overall, but NO DIGITIZER", "Author": "Sean \"Sean\"", "ReviewID": "R1N2SPLF1E0WUQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here is my review after a few days.The best things about this convertible laptop are the keyboard and display (looks awesome).  The unit feels light and solidly built.  It also has a good selection of ports, the sound is pretty good, and I like the ability to use it as a traditional laptop, prop it up like a tent, or fold it into a tablet.  When used as a tablet, it's heavier than a tablet-only device but that is to be expected (I still wouldn't say it's heavy).The touchpad feels a little flimsy to me sometimes, like when I tap it I sometimes hear a little rattle.  It's the \"Apple\" kind of \"clickable\" touchpad.  I'd rather have the solid one that doesn't actually depress.Also, a big thing for me is that this ThinkPad Yoga DOES NOT have a digitizer.  I cannot ding the laptop for this, but beware.  Everything I have read about the differences between ThinkPad Yoga and the IdeaPad version (Yoga Pro 2) stress that the main difference is the digitizer.  I specifically ordered the ThinkPad version for just that reason, but this machine does not have one.Finally, and this has nothing to do with the hardware but I mention it because this is such an integrated experience, if you are coming from Windows 7 be aware that Windows 8 takes some getting used to!UPDATE:- The touchpad isn't as bad as I first thought.  Also, I give Lenovo credit for using Synaptics (and not Alps or Elan).  Sometimes I sense some precision issues but it's not too bad.- Regarding the digitizer, I did look in Device Manager (no hardware listed) and also PC Info (not mentioned there either).  The odd thing is that it _looks_ like there is a stylus in the spot where you'd expect it, but it's just a cutout in the plastic.  It looks to me like they wanted it to look like there is one there.- A bad thing is that the machine turned off on me today.  Very sudden.  I'm thinking it was a Windows thing or driver conflict of some sort.  It did turn right back on.  I also experienced a shutdown with a message about an IRQ conflict with the Synaptics driver.  Windows managed an orderly shutdown and restart on that one.  I expect that will become a known issue and get fixed with an update.- The machine rarely even gets warm.- The keyboard really is great.  Best chicklet KB I've ever used.- In laptop mode or depending on how you hold the tablet, the sound buttons might opposite of what is intuitive to most people.  Not a big deal.  The sound through the speakers is not really loud but I think the sound quality is good.- The recessing keyboard works very well in tablet mode.  It feels solid, like there is no danger of damaging anything on the other side.  The only thing still \"moveable\" around there is the touchpad, which is still depressable.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very solid laptop with caveats", "Author": "sotagear", "ReviewID": "R2RTHCP0UKIGB2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first experience with the Thinkpad line of Lenovo products and it is nicely made, but with a few somewhat troubling caveats. It's a bit more of a solid build than the Ideapad Yoga 2 Pro and has a much more sane screen resolution at 1920x1080 for this 12'5\" screen. Much easier to deal with software that runs on the desktop with this resolution over the Yoga 2 Pro.Pros:Perfect resolution for the screen size.Nice sized touchpad.Great backlit keyboard, except for the Function key placement.Strong wifi range, which I have unfortunately found to be a rarity in most of the popular Ultrabooks lately.Charges fast. About a little over an hour to go from 6% to 100%.Cons:Battery life is not very good. In the first week of usage I have been getting closer to 4-5 hours than the 8 claimed. It goes down quite quickly with just a little bit of browsing.UPDATE (12/27): I ended up getting around 6 hours of battery life after about 10 days of usage, so not quite as bad as originally thought, but certainly not anything to write home about.The wifi on this model with the i5 and 4 gig of ram is single channel. The dual channel wifi adapter is available on the i7 model, according to what one reviewer mentioned.A bit heavy for an Ultrabook. This should be about a half pound lighter to be in line with 13\" ultrabooks of the day.Function key is all the way to the left of the keyboard where you normally expect to have the Control key. Has me hitting Function+C, instead of Control+C, etc more often than I would like.UPDATE (12/27): You can swap the Function key for the Control key in the bios. It's a work around but still a compromise in my estimation because it gets a bit confusing and a handful when doing some function/F-key combinations.A little bit of oversaturation on the screen: Though I like that this is the perfect resolution for this screen size, at times I notice faces can display a bit too much saturation, especially as compared to other laptop screens I've used recently. It also has a warmer look to the whites, which makes it easier on the eyes for text, but probably adds to the overly warm/saturation effect. Not a deal breaker, but noticeable to those that care about such stuff.UPDATE(12/27): As one person that commented on this below had mentioned, you can download the Intel graphics software and tweak the gamma and contrast to probably help this out a bit (Unfortunately I never tied it myself before returning the laptop).Conclusion:Overall, one of the nicer laptops I've tried in the last 6 months, and I think I've tried almost every highly rated Ultrabook to date. However, my biggest concern is the battery life being very pedestrian, along with the added weight. Both of these things have me wondering if I will bother to keep this or not. Ultrabooks or lightweight laptops are made for the traveler and these 2 cons are not conducive to a great traveling companion.UPDATE (12/27): Because of the added half pound of weight, along with a few other niggles that bothered me, I decided to return the laptop, but I still consider it to be a good deal and a strong overall Ultrabook.If the Yoga 2 Pro had not had the over the top resolution and the yellow problem it continues to have after their supposed \"fix\", I would have gone with that since it has better battery life and is lighter to carry. But there just hasn't been a product yet that Lenovo has knocked out of the park for the most important things I'm looking for - wifi strength, weight, battery life, screen clarity, and sane HD screen resolution.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought on costco reviewing here", "Author": "Kelley", "ReviewID": "R1QQ86XE471AT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this same model 128gb 4gb ram at Costco over the holidays, they had it only for a couple weeks so I can't review it there so I figured I'd put my review here where I often look for reviews of stuff. This model was $900 at costco so I'm reviewing it with that price in mind.I really like the thinkpad yoga I have, it has not given me any problems with wifi connecting or any other type of software/hardware glitches.I really like the keyboard, I find it much more pleasing to type on than my old hp or my girlfriends newer hp, I also like it better than the dell xps keyboard that I tried out, I was considering getting the new dell xps 12, but the older one I tried had problems inverting the screen to work in kiosk mode, this yoga doesn't have that problem.It also doesn't have a stylus pen.I don't really use the trackball so I'm not sure if that works well or not.I don't particularly have any feelings about the trackpad, it does depress a bit when you push on it, I don't suppose I've ever used a laptop that had a trackpad that I felt was amazingly superb, I don't feel that way about this one either.My main issue with this yoga honestly is the size, I wish it was a little bigger. I don't intend to use it a bunch on airplanes or business trips, so I think the 12.5 screen is a little on the small side. One might think that it's a bit large and heavy to use as a tablet, and that's true, but really you don't end up using this thing as a tablet in your lap, what you actually do is prop it up in sort of a cross between stand and tablet mode so you don't actually hold the weight of it. basically for my purposes it could be as big as 15 inches. I considered the flex but really the flex just doesn't bend back quite far enough, also a mediocre screen on the flex.I was still pondering maybe returning this and getting the yoga 13 but I have decided that this is better overall, gorilla glass screen, spill resistant keyboard, locking keyboard and a brighter higher definition screen. I think these days it's still worth it to get the best screen you can, as even the brightest screens can't really be used well in direct sun. To me the yoga 2 pro isn't worth the extra money mostly for the same reasons stated above. Really what I hope for in the future is that they will make yoga models in all the sizes, or at least a 14 inch model.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good, but with some issues.", "Author": "CHris", "ReviewID": "R37C2RVDWQ1JKP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is enjoyable to own a convertible laptop like this.

And I was excited for it. I really do not like the new chiclet-style keyboard.I love Thinkpads. I've had them for years. Specifically the X series. I like thin & light laptops, personally. I have owned the X40, X41, X100, X120e, X300, X200, X220, and now Thinkpad Yoga. I'm sure I've owned others throughout the years. I loved them all.I felt that Lenovo has been slipping and was tired of their old crappy displays, so bought a new 2013 Apple MacBook Pro w Retina display. The display is great, but I missed my Lenovo keyboard and backspace button. (Sorry, I think the lack of a backspace button on Mac's is literally retarded, period).This laptop I am probably going to return. I am just not adjusting to the new chiclet-style keyboard. I just don't think I can type well on their. To me, this machine is very similar to all the other laptops out there. The keyboard & trackpoint was what set Thinkpads apart for me. They changed it.Plus, I think the Trackpoint sucks too. It is smaller, and they have made the 3 trackpoint buttons merged with the Touchpad - so it is all one big button. It makes it unwieldy to press, and I think ruins it. So I have been trying to adjust to using the Touchpad, which seems decent but not great.The display is good. Frankly, I am a little confused about what the optimal resolution for a laptop is - I also bought the Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro. It has an absolutely beautiful display - however, the fonts and everything were just too small for me at the end of the day (yes, even after increasing them in Windows Control Panel). Moreover, I din't like the new chiclet-style keyboard, so thought I'd go back to the ThinkPad.The touchscreen is neat, and the foldable 'yoga' feature is cool.. but in my opinion, more of a gadget then actually practical or usable. I'd rather have the great keyboard/trackpoint.It is notable to mention that the version I bought is without stylus - I *may* give the stylus-version one a try.I am going to give this another week to see if I adjust to the new keyboard & trackpoint.. but I am about 90% sure I am going to return this.. and probably go with an older Thinkpad.Disappointed. ;(", "Date": "November 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor packaging and misleading product video on product page.", "Author": "Deepak", "ReviewID": "R3KPS73ZQLNN2T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Paid shipping fee to be delivered on Sat as I was in hurry to buy a good laptop.
