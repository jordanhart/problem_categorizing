{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A nice value, but not designed with me in mind.", "Author": "Bob Langill", "ReviewID": "R2HLFI09MGOQP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Plus: Touchscreen interface  Screen is bright and easy to read  USB 3.0 ports all the way around  Battery life is OK  Light weightMinus: Cursor key layout  Some gestures get misinterpreted.  No extended desktop  Limited resolution on monitor displayIn discussing this machine, my primary comparison is to my Asus EEE netbook, which I still have and use sometimes.I use my new notebook mostly for the same things I used my netbook: access to my stuff and the internet while I'm commuting each day. I have a fairly long commute, so weight, size and battery life are important to me. So far, this machine meets those criteria pretty well.I didn't buy this computer because I was looking for a touchscreen, but it's nice to have. Most of the time, I use the touch pad and cursor keys for navigation. That brings me to the first negative comparison to the netbook. My Eee netbook has the inverted-t layout for the navigation keys. The HP uses a squashed diamond layout with half-height up/down keys. Since they also the pg up/pg dn keys that can be annoying when I'm trying to use them to page through displays or documents.Another key difference is in the F-keys. On the HP, their default mode is as media control keys. To use them as F-keys in applications requires holding the Fn key. I was able to locate information in the manual that told me how to switch them in setup mode and make a one-time change. But it's one indication that HP had someone else in mind when they designed this machine.On plus side, I appreciate having three USB 3.0 ports to connect to.  There are laptops that have only one USB 3.0 and the other connections are USB 2.0. Those manufacturers strike me as willing to cut value for customers even when it's much greater than the costs they save. Because all the ports are USB 3.0, HP didn't put the blue tab on them which runs against current practice.At 11.6 inches, the HP's display is larger than the netbook's 10.3 inches, but it's still small enough to use on the train or bus seat. While the physical display is larger, I've found two ways that it's smaller: connecting to an external monitor and in the desktop mode.When my ASUS Eee connects to my monitor, the display runs at full 1920 x 1080 resolution. With this laptop, the display runs with black sidebars because trying to use higher resolutions gives me a fuzzy display. Downloading the the monitor's video driver didn't improve things.The ASUS display also supports a virtual desktop. I can run multiple applications with reduced overlap by scrolling the virtual desktop that is larger than the display. The lack of a virtual desktop on this HP laptop might not be because of the the machine itself: The ASUS runs XP while this HP is running Windows 8.1.  Regardless of the reason, the missing virtual desktop creates a less convenient setup.Since I've touched upon Windows 8, I'll start by admitting one thing I do appreciate: the short boot up time. It's not the instant on you'll get from tablets, but it's not bad. A few days ago, when I used the XP netbook instead of this laptop, I found myself saying \"Any time now. . .\" after turning it on. On the other hand, under Windows 8, applications can take longer to boot up that the system does. At least, it seems that way.Another plus is the size of the hard drive: 500Gb.  Since it was designed to be a media machine, it needed to have enough room for music, videos, and images. I've backed up all my mp3's and jpg's on this machine and still have lots of room I'm not sure what to do with. Not a bad problem to have.Overall, I'm pleased with the performance and value I'm getting for the price I paid.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "nothing \"beats\" this notebook", "Author": "tiffanyking75", "ReviewID": "ROFIPO8VDI2WW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this during tax season...

I needed something that will fit into my briefcase and leave room for other papers, books, etc. This maching fills this requirement. It will be used primarily for note taking using various basic office products (Word and Excel). It was my solution to a tablet that runs office as well because of the tablets' expensive price. However all that being said this 1.0GHz machine is extremely slow and if anyone wants to buy it for it's size and expect it to operate like a more robust laptop or desktop it will not.

Windows 8.1 has some good functions, but it is not as user friendly as prior versions.  Setup is considerably different in the new Windows but once you get the hang of it you can maneuver quickly and efficiently to where you want to go.  The processor could be faster, but with good wifi it works well.

While at first it seemed easy to use etc, within a month it began to have problems with wavy lines on the screen. At first if you reboot the computer it would then work fine. 3 months in it pretty much died. There are wavy lines and poor color. Apparently this problem is not covered by the warranty so we are simply out our $400.

Surfing through Zillow for real estate is impossibly slow. This is just one example when one wants to be clicking through pictures and new links successively and quickly. We initially bought a Toshiba (Windows 8) when my Dell (Windows 7) went on the fritz and I was desperate for a replacement. Then, my husband got my Dell working again, so I didn't use my HP very often except when I was away from home. I always attributed the HP's slowness to bad Wi-Fi connections. Then, after several (about 9) months, I was forced to use it at home, regularly, when my old laptop acted up yet again. This is when I was able to ascertain that it had not been the Wi-Fi connections or user issues. It is definitely the HP laptop that is lacking.My husband, thankfully, has been able to restore my five-year-old Dell computer twice, so I have something normal to work with. He hasn't been able to do anything to \"fix\" the less-than-one-year-old-hardly-been-used HP Pavilion.I am currently trying to work with HP about the slowness of this computer. HP reps have been very kind through emails and sent me the steps to try and run some computer checks which didn't reveal any issues. Next, I am waiting on a manager to contact me.I also find the glare/shine/reflection of the screen is unacceptable, but that issue pales in comparison to the slowness. By unacceptable I mean that I don't understand how a computer company can market/put a screen on their product that practically acts like a mirror.It's interesting how relative annoyances can be.I truly thank my husband for his tech savvy skills that have kept my Dell alive!
