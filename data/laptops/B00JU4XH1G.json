It is really fast with Solid State Drive added(in my case 256 Gig). It works OK with it's standard 750 Gig Hard drive, bur definitely slow.The processor I3, is fine and works great. I have had I7,I5 and Pentium's in the past, and this processor is just as good for general everyday computing.The graphics (Intel 4600) are great again for normal use, but not so much for hard core games.The audo is unbelivable, especially when hooked to an Onkyo amp as mine is. This laptop does not have \"Beats audio\", but has \"DTS\" and it has the same adjustments as Beats and sounds just as good IMO.So to finalize, this is a great laptop, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop, without robbing the bank.I bought mine from another store (BB), at a better price, but the price here is fair.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00JU4XH1G"}}
