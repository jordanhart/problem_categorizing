I was going to buy another toshiba until I came across this during my research and decided this laptop was the best bang for my buck.  What do I like about it? Everything!! I love the large memory and the 320g hard drive is double of my toshiba.  I don't regret jumping from toshiba brand to sony.  The built in webcam and microphone are great.  They work perfectly with aim, yahoo, and skype.  I was easily able connect to my wireless router without reinstalling the software.  The only downside is the battery.  I will be ordering a large capacity battery soon.  I can't wait hook up my sony hd camcorder and start editing my home videos.  I would definitely recommend this laptop to friends.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop exceeds for the wireless adaptor", "Author": "Paul Wee \"Paul W\"", "ReviewID": "RV83R2PNHRUKI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All in all, its good value for moneyJust remember to upgrade the wireless adaptor drivers from Intel as the default one keeps dropping connection.", "Date": "September 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop I've owned, best that I've seen anyone own.", "Author": "Julian G. Romero", "ReviewID": "R3QOOD0U1O1042", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Short and sweet, this laptop kicks @$$!!!  For the price, you go so much included in this bad boy:  Blu-ray player/burner, [...] video with 1GB dedicated RAM, 16+ in screen, 4GB RAM upgradable to 8GB, decent sized hard drive, I mean the list goes on.  Just look at the description and you see what you get.  I think for 1000 dollars this computer is well worth it.  One bonus, don't know for how long, but if you buy now you should get a free upgrade for Windows 7 when it is released.  If you haven't already heard, it is getting great reviews.  So if you don't like Vista, you can hold out for 7 when it gets released in the fall.  If you are looking for a laptop, look no further than this Sony Vaio.  You will love it.", "Date": "August 19, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0027P9BY2"}}
