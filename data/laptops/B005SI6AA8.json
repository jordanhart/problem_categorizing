It's not too bad a laptop if you get rid of HP's crapware, minus two or so relatively useful utilities. Keep in mind this laptop is not meant to do any heavy lifting, so no gaming, vid editing, etc. What it can do is movies, light gaming like java or the like, music, web, email, composition, etc. For the price, not bad. The touchpad throws me off. I'm used to having an obvious border; this one just uses a light tactile feel. It's also wide, something I'm not used to. It also uses the dual finger thing which I'm not a fan of but I'm pretty sure I can disable this. The hard drive speed is relatively slow in the world of performance. Again though, not a huge issue for what this is supposed to do. One thing that does bother me; the UAC performance. The whole screen goes black for about half a second, which throws you off. You'd think that with a core I3 processor and windows 7 64 bit this would be damn near instant. However, I believe this is an issue with intel video lagging.I'll possibly edit this in the future when I have more info.", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005SI6AA8"}}
