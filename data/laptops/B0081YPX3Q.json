{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent laptop", "Author": "Manisha", "ReviewID": "R2WT0Y8WAQEC57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Dell XPS 15 for about two weeks now and I believe it is an excellent computer. For the past 2 years, I had been using a Dell Inspiron and and I have played with the Dell XPS L502X (The Previous Generation Model) so I decided to give this one a look as my computer for college. There are many great aspects about this laptop, and while there are definitely some things that could be fixed, it's still a great machine for multimedia lovers, students, and even gamers.Hardware-First of all, the hardware is absolutely fantastic. I'm not going to lie, it's a pretty unabashed copy of the Macbook Pro. On the outside, the only main difference is the color of the aluminum. However, the inside has a extremely nice black coating that gives the palm rests a very comfortable feel as well as a unique look. While the design is very sleek, the laptop is still quite heavy at almost 6 pounds. This isn't as bad as it sounds, but for people who will be taking this everywhere, it might be worth testing the weight and seeing if it's for you. Thankfully, the weight does make the laptop feel very sturdy and while I wouldn't be slamming this into the ground anytime soon, it should still survive the occasional drop.The keyboard and trackpad are great as well. The keyboard could do with a little more depth, but it is still comfortable to type on and I had few complaints as I was typing this review. The trackpad is simply amazing. It is made by Synaptics and it is flawless. I've even stopped using a mouse due to its performance. It feels amazing and multi touch gestures work perfectly. It puts pretty much every other Window machine to shame. My only nitpick would be that it has trouble differentiating right and left clicks every now and then but outside of Apple, no other manufacturer has such a good touchpad.Many people have complained about the WiFi and honestly, I've had no major problems. Reception is slightly weaker as compared to other laptops, so I'm guessing the aluminum is interfering somehow. However, I'm still getting around the same network speeds as compared to other laptops, although my speeds have been slightly lower so hopefully Dell can fix this with a driver update.Display and Speakers-The display is a 350-nit TN panel covered with Corning Gorilla Glass. While IPS panels, such as those found in the new Asus Zenbooks, have a more varied color gamut and better viewing angles, the display on the Dell is still awesome. Everything is crisp and clear, and most text is readable without having to zoom in. Contrast is great with the low black levels and viewing angles are still great. The L502X had a better color gamut but this is still a great display, especially for those coming from the traditional, low quality 1366x768 TN panels.The speakers are great as well, even if they don't impress as much as the display. They're loud and clear but they're a bit lacking in bass, especially coming from the L502X with the integrated subwoofer. That being said, they still outclass most every other laptop in sheer volume and clarity. Dell has some included software that you can mess with to provide you the sound that you would like.Performance-I've never been a fan of benchmarks, and I generally rely on real world testing to see how the computer does. So far, I've been nothing short of impressed. The 3rd Gen Intel i7 and 8GB of RAM handle everything smoothly and lag is virtually nowhere to be found. I've opened multiple windows of Chrome playing 1080p video and I still have no trouble doing other activities. The computer does use a traditional hard drive instead of a SSD, and while performance could benefit from the addition of a SSD, I honestly haven't seen the need to. The hard drive is plenty fast, but it does generate a noticeable amount of heat under the left palm rest, so keep that in mind. The Dell also uses a 32GB SSD to quickly start up and shut down the computer, as well as quickly open frequently used applications and so far start up and shut down times have been great, although they fall short of SSD only computers, especially ultrabooks.As far as games go, the 2GB NVIDIA Geforce 640M video card should be able to play most everything at respectable frame rates, although you will probably have to turn down some effects if you want to play games at the full 1080p resolution. However, games such as Assassin's Creed Revelations and Skyrim look great and the computer has no problem with playing them with most effects turned up. There have been many complaints of throttling, especially have 1-2 minutes of intense gameplay, but I've noticed no problems. If you purchase the laptop, I would suggest upgrading to the new BIOS as to make sure you don't come across any throttling issues.As far as bloatware goes, Dell has been surprisingly lenient. There's very little true bloatware, other than the annoying McAfee trial, some included Dell software, and Microsoft Office Starter 2010 (which isn't even really bloatware) so kudos to Dell.Noise and Heat-Unfortunately, the laptop has a tiny bit more noise than I would like. This probably has to do with the fact that it uses a hard drive, instead of an SSD. That being said, if you're browsing the web or doing regular office work, you'll never hear it, especially if you're playing music. But if you start playing games and doing some other intense multimedia work, the fans will spin up and definitely make themselves heard. Thankfully, the fans are located in the hinge so you're not exposed to the air and the computer doesn't tend to heat up to the point of discomfort.Like I mentioned before, I suspect the hard drive generates a certain amount of heat which is noticeable, but never truly annoying. I had no problem using the machine on my lap for hours.Battery-Unfortunately, the battery is sealed within the machine so there's no replacing it without a lot of effort. However, I find the battery to be plenty sufficient for most activities. Obviously, the display will use the most power so toning it down, and deactivating things such as the keyboard backlight will extend the battery life a great deal. If you're just doing plain web browsing mixed in with office work, expect around 4-6 hours of battery and if you're playing video, expect around 4-5 hours. This is acceptable, although some Ultrabooks and Macbooks do feature slightly better battery life.Wrap-Up-Like I said, I believe this is a fantastic machine. While it would have been nice if Dell had some more original design features, it's still rock solid and actually feels better than the Macbook Pro. General performance is great, and the screen and speakers make this an excellent laptop for anybody interested in viewing a lot of movies or listening to music. The occasional gamer will enjoy the dedicated graphics and everybody will appreciate the respectable battery life. If only it was around $100 cheaper, it would be absolutely perfect and I believe it would then deserve 5 stars for being such a great all around laptop. For now, I'm giving 4.5 stars and rounding down until Dell can work out some of the kinks with the WiFi and throttling other users are reporting. If you're a college student who needs a machine with better battery life and less weight, I would suggest the new Macbook Air or the new Asus Zenbooks but this machine will handle everything you need and more.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware! Great Computer except for WiFi", "Author": "jekakabr", "ReviewID": "R3ASWIA6KM2ZHA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer after buying and returning a MacBook Pro - just couldn't wrap my mind around OS X after 20 years of windows.  Old habits die hard!  This is a fantastic computer - excellent display, trackpad technology getting closer to Apple, excellent construction, and overall excellent performance.  The only problem, and it is major in my opinion, is that the WiFi speed drops to near zero when more than 10 to 20 feet from a router.  The WiFi problem has been extremely well documented on the discussion threads at Notebook Review online.  There is even a Dell representative answering questions and disseminating the latest updates.  As of today, 1 August, Dell does not know if the problem is software (drivers) or hardware related.  Driver updates and swapping the WiFi card to another brand have not yielded success, so signs are pointing to a hardware problem, but nothing has been confirmed by Dell.Bottom line - if WiFi capability at a distance of more than 10 feet from the router is required, purchase with extreme caution until Dell can ensure the issue is fixed.  If Dell cannot offer a fix soon, I will return mine while I still can.", "Date": "August 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Easily the worst Dell model I've had in 12+ years as a Dell customer", "Author": "matt", "ReviewID": "R1DHZ0JO9DIXHA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Where to start?  From day 1, the machine had some glitch where 7 out of 8 GB's of memory were being consumed for no reason.  I spent at least 30 hours with Dell Pro Support trying to get it fixed, when eventually the tech told me, \"this is just a waste of time, we need to get you a new machine.\"  (Pro Support is generally pretty good, btw, I have no complaints with them.)  That machine's display also had lines across the bottom disrupting the picture, and the fan was replaced because it was overheating.  And it had the annoying trackpad issues that a lot of other purchasers seemed to encounter (Google it).  There was another reason they sent a guy out to replace a part, but I don't remember what it was.  I figured it was just a cursed machine and was happy they agreed to replace it.Then replacement machine had the same trackpad issues and now has a failing wireless antenna.  At least that's what the tech told me is happening, and that there's nothing he can do.  Their engineers are \"working to solve it\" but it's supposedly a known issue and beyond the scope of what Pro Support can rectify.  So in the meantime my case has been kicked up to the NSA of Dell's Customer Support team and in a few days I am supposed to find out whether they will send me a free external wireless card, replace the machine, tell me to go to hell, or who knows what.  The tech can't even contact this top secret division- a special requisition must be made by his manager and then the Star Chamber (the REC is the name, I think) will determine my fate when they can get to it.  I just have to wait for a phone call.Again, I don't have a problem with Dell's tech support team, and over the years I've bought more than 25 different Dell desktop, laptop and server models.  So I like the company.  But my personal experience, validated by various issues you can find by looking around the web, is that this model is a piece of crap.

I bought 16GB of RAM and replaced my HDD with another SSD.  Works amazingly fast and is sleek and thin with great battery life.  Way better specs than the MacBook Pro --- and HALF the price.  The Gorilla Glass and 400-nit 1080p screen gives the Retina Display a run for it's money --- extremely bright and super sharp.  Dell has had some mistakes --- but this is NOT one of them.  Excellent laptop, excellent price.", "Date": "August 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Died less than a year after buying it.", "Author": "Dness", "ReviewID": "R4VWR74YFRK2B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was originally very pleased.  I noticed the wifi was slower than other devices I have but not terrible.  However I couldn't save anything to one of the drives (it comes with s SSD and a traditional drive, the traditional drive wouldn't allow anything to be saved to it), Dell had me reinstall the OS. Since then while booting up I started getting a message that said one of the disk needed to be checked for consistency, it'd count down to 7 then skip the check.  Dell told me this was nothing to worry about.  Then one day (10 months after purchase) when I tried to shut it down I got the blue screen of death, and the fan became extremely loud.  Now it won't start up.  It doesn't matter if I try to start it in safe mode or regularly, it just goes back to the start up screen and asks if I want to launch startup repair or start windows normally.Update: After spending 1.5 hours on the phone with Dell one day, then over 2 hours today I have decided to never buy Dell again.  Neither one of the tech support people had any clue what was wrong and did not offer any more support than the onscreen instructions.  Well I can read for myself. When the reinstall popped up an unspecified error message they had no clue what to do. I'm now waiting on more restore disc although he couldn't explain how these were any different than the thumb drive, just that I should try them.  I asked about sending the lap top back to get a new one, or just a refund and they said no the lap top is fine.  Really? Because not being able to start up the lap top or reinstall windows is a pretty big problem in my book.", "Date": "May 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Much better service than buying it directly from Dell", "Author": "Jean-Marc", "ReviewID": "RLI3S8T5WF37V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The machine is a monster. Its very fast and you can easily work with serveral opened files and using different software at the same time with no problem. The only thing I don't really like is the mouse it's sensitive and hard to get use to. Any small movement and you are in a different document or software. It's very annoying. Other than that the computer is great with a very nice sound system for such small speakers. I definitely recommend it over any other computer I've used.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "You Get What You Pay For", "Author": "Chris V", "ReviewID": "R1R02SNVIYZFLE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "well first of all this PC is the best thing ive used my whole life. the i7 processor 7,200 rpm 750 gb hard drive and solid state memory make it lightning fast! But all good things will always have a few flaws, My only concern is the touch pad... its a little TOO sensitive but works well. the screen looks crisp as hell... the backlight keys are a nice touch and come in handy in low lighting. I received my package in the time and with no fuss.

This is the second Dell laptop I've purchased through Amazon in the last 4 months, both worked for about an hour and then completely fried; the first had a faulty video card, this one didn't have the OS installed correctly. While trying to fix it with Dell's oh so wonderful help (sarcasm) the computer has gone from getting jammed at the Dell logo (which is apparently a HUGE problem according to the tech) to now being stuck in an infinite reset loop. The tech said I must have done something incorrectly which is just rude. Piece of garbage is being returned.TL DR;Dell doesn't know how to make computers and their tech team isn't interested in addressing issues that EVERYONE seems to be having.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell's new awesome work!", "Author": "eden li", "ReviewID": "R3W3H00LVYMLWB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Every thing of this laptop are AWESOME!!!!

This is going to be a short one but hopefully useful to somebody: - Laptop's wireless works fine.  (ref other review) - It is SOLID. Awesome build quality - Screen -- was my #1 consideration.  it is unbelieveably sharp! with wide view angles and extreme color definition.  I LOVE IT - Discrete graphics performance -- Really good -- surprisingly good actually for a laptop.  I can play SWTOR on almost the highest settings.  Looks really good. Plays smooth.  Doesn't overheatOnly other thing I'll say is definitely do get it with windows 8.  Yes no touch screen.  But what's cool is the latest models touchpad is designed for win8 so you can flick in from the sides to pull up charms menus etc --right on the touch pad -- which is also pretty awesome itself.Can you tell I like my laptop?
