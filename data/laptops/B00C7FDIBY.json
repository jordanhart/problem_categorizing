It tries to be both but it is much more laptop than tablet. it is really really fast--pages load quickly; it starts and shuts down fast and programs pop right up. the keyboard is cramped but with the touchscreen and onscreen keyboard it's not much of an issue for me--plus I have small hands. it's not perfect--the angle with the keyboard out isn't the best so you might need to prop it a bit in the back. I bought this instead of the Surface Pro 2 because frankly, the stats on this are so much better plus there are more ports and connectivity options, not to mention the keyboard is built right in (which can be a plus or minus depending on your needs). Those extra ports and keyboard come at a price--this laptop is heavier than you might think. If you are looking for a tablet, get yourself an Ipad or Galaxy Tab, etc.. If you need a laptop with tablet capabilities plus full Windows and all that a real operating system has to offer, then you'll want this or something like it. Did I mention that this has a stylus? you can draw or write--take notes--what have you. That's another reason I bought this. How easy is it to just take notes with your own writing (and even convert into text) rather than try to type on such a tiny keyboard? Time will tell how much more I discover about this Duo 11. I will update this review with more as I get to know this beast.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,599.00", "Features": "Screen Size: 11.6\"\nScreen Resolution: 1920 x 1080\nProcessor Type: Intel\nProcessor Model: i7-3537U\nProcessor Speed: 2GHz", "Name": "Sony 11.6\" Laptop 8GB 256GB | SVD11225CYB", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41f6Co6qKBL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C7FDIBY"}}
