{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best laptop I've ever owned", "Author": "Arun Anantharaman", "ReviewID": "R16IXTKS8WYFXZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All the computers I own are HPs. My older ones have always had fairly poor design materials and have notoriously overheated. When I purchased this laptop I was nervous about these common HP problems as well as the harsh review given over the quality of the screen. When I opened this laptop, however, I was blown away by the quality of packaging as well as the breathtaking aesthetics of the laptop itself. Tentatively I turned on the computer (as I prepared for the worst), but, to my surprise, I was greeted with a screen that easily displayed vibrant colors and looked just about as good as any 14\" laptop would. Apple is a bit ahead on the screens and batteries they use, but this laptop has a perfectly fine display and a fantastic battery life. I copied vast amounts of music and videos from an external drive while installing various programs (such as visual studio which took about an hour to install) and this laptop completed all those operations while living up to a battery life of about 4 hours (I imagine the battery life is much better when the computer is simply word processing or internet browsing). Another surprise was the quality of the graphics processing in this computer. So far I have run MW2 and Fallout: New Vegas on high and ultra (respectively), and the graphics card has handled everything with ease. I do plan on giving it harder tasks to accomplish (ahem Crysis 2), but for all graphics computing within the norm of PC games I'd say this computer can definitely handle it. While running these games I also checked the amount and temperature of the air that was moving out of the vents and once again I was surprised at how cool it was. Another plus is the notable lack of vents on the bottom of the laptop which invariably suck up dust and cause the computer to run exponentially hotter (there are two vents only: one on the right side and one in the middle of the back). The only complaint I have is the power cable which is pretty deep and kinda hard to put in and take out.In conclusion, the i5 processor, generous RAM and VRAM, mid class 2 graphics card, secondary storage, superior sound card, slot-loading optical drive, back-lit keyboard, and overall appearance should leave any consumer satisfied and proud to own a laptop of this caliber. The xbox is also a nice plus (which you can get off amazon and hp just check the details).", "Date": "July 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "the ultimate laptop", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R1ERPASYM7KC2Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello, this is my first review!!First of all I will talk about the HP envy's design. its design is just really cool, it loos like a very sophisticated, elegant, and very modern laptop. Also the lid of the laptop is made out this opaque black aluminum which hides a alot scratches, but is also a fingerprint magnet, but if you clean it once in a while you won't have a problem.Next, the most important thing for me performance.The laptop with the i5 processor, has a very good performance,it is quick, it loads windows in a few seconds. I use it for gaming a lot, and I have had no problem playing games like Mafia 2, Mass Effect 2, Half Life 2 and other games, ALL in High quality graphics, and a 1366x768 resolution. The only bug I have with the performance is in the noise, the laptop is a little bit loud, not extremely. For example is you are at work with your laptop and there is a little noise in the office you won't hear it, but if you are at home alone, you will probably hear it. TIP: shut off the cool sense because it will lower the noise and save battery( the laptop won't get hot anyways). Something I love about it is how cool (sense of heat) it is, while gaming it doesn't even get slightly warm.Next screen:The screen is real glossy, but also very nice resolution, the colors are bright as hell. Also the nice is  really nice for gaming, but not too big, to carry around.Track pad and keyboard;The track pad many people say that it is horrible, but it really isn't its just something you got to get used too. I have had this PC for almost 3 weeks and I haven't felt any difficulty on the track pad, only maybe in the first 2 or 3 uses, but then nothing. The keyboard does have a slight flex but nothing serious that you would feel.Battery: There as myths about this PC's battery. Let me tell you, they are false, I believe Apple invented them to make people don't buy this PC. For example, yesterday I played 3 and half hours on battery with my pc hooked up to my TV  with high graphics, high performance and wireless turned on, and when I stopped playing I still had 15% battery= 35min (The laptop said) but once I started instead using Facebook the PC told me that (after 15min) I had 10%= to 30min. So the battery can easily last up to 5:30 or 6 hours.\\Finally I will talk somethings in general.Overall this laptop is really great, it has excellent performance, excellent SOUND( the beats sound is GREAT), also excellent graphics and excellent price compared to similar laptops in the market, such as the Macbookpro which is 1200 dollars the 13.3 inch, which doesn't even have a graphics card (LOL). don't think it twice and buy this laptop, Also if you might want it with an i7 processor you can get it too. The only disadvantage again is the sound, which is not much and maybe the fingerprint magnet lid. If you have any questions please don't be afraid to ask here and I will get to you.", "Date": "July 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome laptop", "Author": "yamugushi", "ReviewID": "R346JD9XESYO24", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off I would like everyone to know that I bought this as a Macbook clone, because while I admire the aesthetics of macs I'm not a huge fan of the OS. In that it succeeds, from the bezel trim, to the smooth finish it is a close match to the real thing. With Windows 7 which I much prefer. After using the laptop for about a week I have no complaints, except for the screen, it does have a bit of glare and I wish the envys' still came with the superior radiance display instead of the cheaper Brightview. Although I wouldn't be as dramatic about it as the other guy, the black aren't grey like the other guy said. It does have a lot of glare at 60% brightness which I use by default to save battery (at 100% its barely noticeable). But is it bearable at the least.A bit on the specs, this laptop is pretty fast, I love its large 7200 rpm HD (which copied all my music and videos in like 20 mins, which was much faster than it was when I wrote to a 5400) the i5 seems fast, with no hiccups so far. A few of my friends have suggested I go with an i7, which you as a customer might consider. However to me battery life is king with a laptop, and the fact is an i7 just takes up more juice period. However if you want more of a complete desktop replacement, and want to be plugged in all the time def go with the i7.In closing I love this laptop, except for the grounded charger cable I almost forgot that LOL, it's prolly just a problem for me because my house only has a couple 3 prong outlets. (Grounded = 3 prong, 2 prong is what I thought was the norm but I guess not for HP)Also the complaints from past models seem to be fixed, i.e. the trackpad, it works just as good as a mac if not better for me, it might be because I'm used to touch phones and such idk.Edit: I would just like to add a few things, First the battery life is awesome, I use it maybe an hour or two a day and charge it only a few times a week. Another added bonus which wasn't even advertised was the inclusion of adobe elements,(consumer level) such as photoshop elements and premiere elements. These retail for $150, and are awesome, especially since they beat out mac software such as imovie.", "Date": "July 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!", "Author": "Eric.Santibanez", "ReviewID": "RJNF73JCAOVH5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is great. At first I thought I would be paying for the beats logo, but that was not the case at all. Besides from being very stylish and cool looking this computer has very good hardware. The beats audio makes the laptop have good sound (Although I will admit I expected a little more from the speakers in the laptop, but with an okay pair of headphones it sounds pretty boss). The keys are really nice and easy to use. The touch pad is also nice easy to use and it has a feature were you can lock the touch pad. The laptop itself run very well it doesn't come with any BS already installed programs. It comes with photoshop elements which is a cool bonus. and the webcam is great one of the nicest I've seen on a laptop. Overall this laptop is great for the price.

First off, I wouldn't get this without the SSD drive - it's probably the most noticeable performance enhancement you're able to add to the computer.Everything was as advertised - the computer is cool and has a distinct look, I love the feel (slightly rubberized) and the build quality is undeniably the best I've seen on any computer I've every used, overall performance was snappy.However, it's billed as a competitor to the MacBook Pro but this just can't compete with the MBP's size. The Envy is built like a tank. I use a MacBook Pro at work and was expecting something similar. Every time I fly I drop the Mac into the seat pocket but there's no way you could do that with the Envy. Just lugging it around my house is a pain. I certainly don't want to travel with it.So I'm returning it, but should say it's not a bad computer, just better suited for days gone by when people were more willing to tollerate a big beast of a machine. In the age of MacBook Airs and Samsung Series 9s this seems outdated and I'd be kicking myself if I had this Envy for 2 or 3 years.I really wanted to like it, but couldn't get past the size. However, if that isn't a consideration and you want to drop a little change on a machine, this would be a great option.", "Date": "August 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Huge Improvement for an HP", "Author": "Daniel", "ReviewID": "R173IV8PL0NV8Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have owned more than 4 hp laptops/computers in the last.. 2-3 months. They keep breaking and this was the last chance that I was going to give HP. Upon receiving the product in the mail, I was astonished by its beautiful packaging. I looked for every little problem about this laptop like I had on my other HP's. After having it for a month now, I am simply amazed. This laptop is rock solid and problem free! What I really like about this laptop is the keyboard, sound quality, build quality, webcam, performance, and it's touch pad. There are a few problems though, the screen resolution is a bit low for the cost (1366x768),and the battery lasts me an average 2 hours 40 minutes on HP recommended. Also the laptop speakers are not great, they are just your regular laptop speakers, but that all changes when you plug speakers or headphones into the headphone jack. The sound quality and the bass feels very very good! Overall this laptop is amazing and I definitely recommend it!

I did read prior to purchasing numerous reviews stating that the display of non-Radiance Envy's were lacking in quality. I did not realize how lacking in quality these screens would be.Upon opening the Beats Envy 14, I found the quality of packaging to be superb. Quite possibly the nicest product packaging I have ever seen. The laptop itself is beautiful as well. The matte black surfaces felt solid and the overall build quality was strong. I did find that the keyboard had a bit more flex in it than I would have preferred. Sponginess can be found at almost all points along the keyboard. The outer lid of the laptop also showed fingerprint marks immediately.The Envy 14 is one great looking book from the outside. Unfortunately, books can't just be judged by their covers! Upon starting up the laptop, I was immediately disappointed with the brightness of the screen. The room was fairly dark when it first came on, so the screen really shouldn't have been struggling. Secondly, the default screen background is a Beats logo on a black background. At almost all viewing angles, though, this background looks grey. Not even a dark grey. Just grey. Next I went to watching some DVD videos. Colors were completely washed out, every part of the rainbow having a greyish hue to it. And the low resolution of the display made me feel like I was watching a VHS tape in 1987.So the Envy 14 has found itself returned to sender. My wife has a Macbook 13, and maybe I have been spoiled by that screen. All that I know is that I can't recommend the Envy for one reason, and one reason only. An awful screen.Thanks for reading, and good luck in finding your next laptop.", "Date": "June 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "HP Beats Edition", "Author": "Jan C", "ReviewID": "R1BHYNOQC5DW7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My son loves this computer.
