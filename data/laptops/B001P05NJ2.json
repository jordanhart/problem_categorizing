{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WOW Best laptop your money can buy.", "Author": "Jaewoo Kim \"OB-Wan\"", "ReviewID": "R3PK9WSX3ITRS3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own the latest 2.8Ghz MacBook Pro with 512MB of VRAM, 4gb 1024mhz RAM, new polymer battery,  and optional 7200 RPM 500GB drive.  I am using both Mac OS and Vista Premium using Bootcamp. I have used my MacBook Pro for a month.Compared to my previous laptop (Dell XPS 1530: 2.0 Ghz, 2GB RAM, 256MB 8600GT VRAM), which was a very good laptop, the MacBook Pro is  stunningly awesome.  The MacBook Pro is far smaller and portable yet performs at MUCH higher level than my Dell ever did.LOOKSIf the MacBook Pro was a woman, it would be Miss Universe. It is thin, light, and as portable as 15.4 inch laptop can be.  Its aluminum casing is not only pleasing to the eye, but also pleasing to the touch as well. There is no cheap plastic anywhere to be found.PERFORMANCEVista Performance Index rates my MacBook Pro at 5.5 (5 is considered very good). The only reason why it is not higher is because the Nvidia 512MB 9600 is not awesome (but still very good) in 3D graphics performance. It is worth noting the 9600 laptop graphics card still performs better in 3D graphics than majority of desktop graphics cards of today.From a usability perspective, this laptop is blazing fast. There is no noticeable lag between CPU and Memory as I have seen with my Dell XPS 1530 laptop (Dell is undermining the performance of its laptops by using cheaper and subpar memory chips). The BUS on this system is also top notch as well.When I play BioShock on Vista, the graphics looks very crisp and the overall responsiveness is very good.Bottom line: you will not be disappointed with the performance of this laptop unless you are comparing it to that of a high end desktop. Certainly, you will be hard pressed to find any medium size 15.4 inch laptop that can even duplicate MacBook Pro's overall performance.TOUCHPAD and SOUNDThe new touchpad is the mouse reinvented. The new touchpad is so good, this is the ONLY laptop which I do not carry a separate portable mouse.  The new touchpad is large, responsive, and just has that WOW factor to it. THE NEW TOUCHPAD, BY ITSELF, IS A GOOD REASON TO GET A MACBOOK.On Vista, the touchpad works almost as well as it does on Mac OS. The only feature missing in Vista is the ability to twist pictures and other objects (not all apps in Mac OS support this feature either).The sound quality is good, but not terrific. On Vista, the MacBook produces maybe 60% of maximum volume it can produce on Mac OS. I have tried reinstalling drivers on Vista but to no avail. I wish MS or Apple will fix this problem (I am sure this is a driver, and not a hardware, issue).PORTABILITY, BATTERY, and HEATBecause of its small form factor and solid all aluminum body, the MacBook Pro is eminently portable. I have had many of laptops (about 8) both for work and for personal use, and this laptop is BY FAR the most portable of all.The battery lasts around 7 hours when I run the Mac OS (9600 graphics card turned off). The battery lasts 4 hours when I run the Vista Home Premium edition (9600 graphics card turn on because it can't be turned off in Vista). My main concern, however, with running Vista on this laptop is not with the battery life but with excess heat output.This laptop is flat and the hottest portion of this laptop is concentrated in the rear bottom. When placed on a flat surface, much of the heat is trapped underneath. The MacBook Pro can overheat to a point where it is uncomfortable to touch the upper surface near the keyboard.  The heat isn't much of a problem with Mac OS, but with Vista, the user must be careful. I strongly advice using MacBook on a open bottom surface, such as laptop stand with an open bottom surface area for ventilation, when using Vista.  You laptop will last longer.Mac OS vs VISTAI was pleasantly surprised that Mac OS can now run Flash and Adobe Acrobat Reader. The compatibility between Mac and PC is closer than ever. MS Entourage (part of Mac Office 2008) is compatible with MS Exchange email, calendar, and contacts. Overall, I am impressed with the Mac OS Leopard. But its achilles heel is still software availability. Although Apple has greatly expanded its library of available Mac compatible software, most softwares, particularly video games,  still do not run on Mac. For Vista, and its successor Windows 7, to better compete against the Mac OS in the laptop market space, it needs to greatly enhance its battery life and substantially lower its heat output.FLAWSI have only two gripes1)Vista cannot utilize the full range of sound the MacBook hardware is capable. Notably, the maximum volume is too low. This can be easily fixed by Apple by updating the sound driver in BootCamp (HINT).2)The Caps Lock button is extremely easy to press. So easy, I wish I could find a way to disable the key.", "Date": "July 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "A great, but expensive machine.", "Author": "Jon R", "ReviewID": "R3LDSGWN561WBV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When looking over reviews for Macs, you tend to run into the Apple fanatics. These people will praise anything that Apple makes, regardless of whether its worth the price or not. Having owned and used both PCs and Macs, I have no allegiance to either. I'm going to try to make this as unbiased as possible.Whether you should go with a Mac or PC largely depends on what you'll use it for. These days Mac ARE PCs under the hood, they just use Apple's BIOS (EFI) and of course OS X. OS X is hands down a superior OS to Windows, however there are many applications that won't work under it. Sure you can boot Windows on Mac now, but why would you pay the premium to use Apple's proprietary hardware if your going to use Windows anyway? If your going to get a Mac make sure most of your applications will run on it. Otherwise the Macbook becomes an overpriced PC.That said this is a review of the Mackbook Pro, so here are the pros and cons of it. Its a bit long, but I tried to point out everything.PROS- Beautiful, bright screen- Backlit keyboard- Glass cover LCD, so you can wash it without worring about damaging the LCD.- Fast DDR3 memory- An integrated graohics card to conserve power (GeForce 9400) and a decent graphics card (Nvidia 9600 GT) to use for gaming and graphic intense programs.- Slot-load DVD drive, you don't have to worry about the tray.- Firewire, a feature missing from the regular Macbook- Nice large and responsive touchpad.- OS X performs much better than Windows. Almost no crashes/freezes, very hard to get a virus, and faster.- No preloaded bloatware, in fact most of the apps included are quite useful and easily removed if you want the space back.- Decent speakers for a laptop.- I have no benchmarks, but it seems like Vista runs faster on my Macbook even though the hardware is inferior to my other laptop.- The thinnest and lightest 15 inch notebook I've ever encountered. I have no problem lugging it back and forth.CONS- It get HOT under intense use (especially above the number pad).- The DVD drive is slow to burn and read.- Screen resolution should be higher for this price.- Multi-Touch touchpad takes some getting used to.- THE PRICE.- Despite the fact that Nvidia claims its possible to use the 9400 and 9600 in \"hybred SLI\" (using the 9400 to give the 9600 a power boost) Apple has not included the functionality. There are report that it may come with the next release of OS X.- The HDD is realitivly slow at only 5400 RPM. They should have gone with a 7200RPM. On the bright side its possible to upgrade the drive yourself.- The only video output port is a \"Mini Display Port\". There are currently only two screens on the market that natively support this. Therefor you need to purchase a converter to use HDMI, DVI, or VGA.- The glass screen is VERY reflective.- For the most part its not upgradeable. You can add memory or a new HDD and that's it. However, most laptops are either not upgradable or the \"upgrades\" are so expensive that its better to buy a new one instead.- A minor qualm for me, and something common to nearly all Macs is the lack of an HDD access light. This can sometimes be useful. Also common to al Macs is the keyboard and shortcuts. These are different from Windows and take getting use to. For the most part neither is better than the other, its just a matter of learning a new setup.Overall I love my Macbook. Despite its higher price you get a quality machine for your money. Its much more solid than my other laptop, and s far seems more stable. I would say that if you don't game (or use one of the few games that support OS X) go for this. If you've never thought about a Mac before, its really not that hard to get to know it. Its designed for the computer illiterate (According to Apple, I wouldn't go quite that far), so you shouldn't have trouble finding your way around. Despite the good, I still would recommend you stick with the PC if you intend on gaming. Macs are getting there, but they just don't stand up to a gaming PC.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "To heck with the skeptics, this new Pro is wonderful!", "Author": "Macondray J. Steiger", "ReviewID": "R2Q04Y88E6D1ME", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I read all of Amazon and CNet's reviews before buying, both the positive and the negative.  This new Macbook Pro is absolutely wonderful, incorporating many advantages over my first generation Macbook Pro, with no disadvantages that I have been able to find.The new glossy LED backlit screen is excellent, clear and much brighter than it's CCF predecessor.  It also uses less power, which accounts for the Macbook Pro's noticeably longer battery life, in spite of the fact that the Pro's new battery has been slightly downsized.  Great new keyboard, and EXCELLENT trackpad.  Performance is also faster.  Easily accessible HDD.  And, the most obvious benefit is its beautiful new design, which incorporates all of the excellent features of the first generation Macbook Pro, and then improves upon it.  Great job Apple!Perhaps some of the negative comments regarding the new glossy screen and trackpad were made before their new owners had a chance to fully appreciate these new features?Very happy that I took the plunge to a new Macbook Pro, and I highly recommend it to others!", "Date": "December 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Apple's New MacBook Pro: Reviewed", "Author": "alxclrsn", "ReviewID": "R2QSWN25L359SM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Introduction:After keeping millions in what seemed to be perpetual suspense, Apple finally broke the ice, and, in October, released completely redesigned MacBooks and MacBook Pros. I like many Apple users, ordered my MacBook Pro within a week of its release, (October 20th) and, with great anticipation, opened the box on the 30th. Unfortunately for me, upon inspecting the MacBook Pro that I had ordered, I discovered a fair sized chip in the aluminum casing behind the screen, on the bottom right corner. I immediately called Apple to see what they were going to do to rectify the situation. After waiting on hold for about ten minutes, my call was answered by a very nice man, who apologized profusely for any inconvenience. Unfortunately, there was not much he could do, so I was transfered to a product specialist. By this point, you are undoubtedly bored by this story, so let it suffice to say, that after another two weeks I was finally presented with a working MacBook Pro, as well as two red iPod Shuffles as an apology.Apology accepted, Apple. Now, onto my `test' configuration. This exceptional `Book came with a 2.8 gigahertz processor, 4 gigabytes of RAM, two graphics cards: an NVIDIA 9600M with 256 megabytes of shared video RAM, and an NVIDIA 9600GT, with 512 megabytes of dedicated DDR3 video RAM. To top this baby off, it also has a 128 gigabyte solid state drive, to access data at light-speed, with added security. In addition, like every other new MacBook Pro, this one also came with a 15.4 inch widescreen display, backlit keyboard similar to that on the MacBook Air, an iSight camera and microphone, an all aluminum unibody enclosure, and a buttonless, multi-touch trackpad. So, without further ado, lets begin.Screen:I love this screen. First off, it is lit by LED's, which means it is brighter and more efficient than its earlier iterations. It also has `instant on' capabilities, meaning that lights up as soon as you open the lid. Now, nearly everybody's number one gripe with this machine is the glass that is covering the display. While it increases the richness and vibrancy of the colors, and increases the screen's durability, it is also reflective. The reflection can, in direct sunlight, cause an admittedly distractive reflection. This does not especially bother me, though, because you can simply rotate the laptop a few degrees to the left or right to completely counteract this problem. This makes glass an ideal material for a laptop screen, in my opinion, because if the glare gets bad, you can always just rotate the machine. Now the new LED Cinema Display is another story...Unibody:At the release of this product, Apple was keen to stress the design of this product, including its new `unibody' enclosure. So, what's this all about? Well, in a normal laptop, many interior parts must be added to keep the the computer from twisting or torquing. What Apple has done is replace those parts with a single machined piece of aluminum, thus cutting down on weight and increasing durability. Basically, the metal top case that has holes for the keyboard, trackpad, speakers, and power button is the `unibody.' Honestly, the laptop does feel sturdier, but the weight remains the same, at least for the Pro. I really don't think anybody but an engineer is going to seriously consider this a serious feature, though.Keyboard:As I stated in an earlier review of the MacBook Air, this is, hands down, Apple's best keyboard. I like everything about it. I can, though, notice a slight difference in the feeling of this keyboard when compared with the MacBook Air. The keys feel a bit springier... and I like it. The backlighting is very nice, too, and I noticed that it gets brighter than the Air. One should know that the baseline MacBook does not have backlighting, while the higher end MacBook has `dumb' backlighting which lights the keyboard for five seconds after every key strike, rather than relying on an ambient light sensor. Otherwise, the keyboard is the same.TrackpadThe MacBook Pro is sporting an all new trackpad, which is made entirely of glass. Honestly, you can't tell that its glass. It feels exactly the same. Well, except for the lack of buttons, that is. Yeah, it appears that Steve hates buttons so much that he is attempting to remove them from Apple products... one button at a time. I'm pretty sure that `Jony' Ive is in on that too. It's the great Apple conspiracy! In all seriousness, though, the lack of buttons is a little annoying at first, but you soon get used to it. As a replacement, our fruity friends made the entire trackpad click, which is actually a pretty good alternative. As I said earlier, it takes a while, but you get used to it. Also, they made the bottom corners extra clicky to make it feel more like the old trackpad, while making it progressively harder to click the farther up the trackpad you get.Battery:Apple has made it easier than ever to access the battery on its new laptops. No longer do you risk marring your pristine machine's finish with a coin. Now, all that you need to do is push two latches and remove a small cover to obtain access to both the hard drive and battery. Also, the batteries are smaller, which is nice if you are carrying a spare. What is interesting to me, though, is that apple styled it after the original iPhone, with the aluminum and black plastic two tone thing. As far as battery life is concerned, its great, as long as you use the 9600M. Once you switch it to the GT, it starts sucking power like there's no tomorrow. Overall, with normal use, (like web surfing, video chatting, and listing to music) I get about 3.5 to 4 hours of battery life. When I really start using this beast, and yes, it is a beast, (Adobe CS4, Logic Studio, Final Cut) I get a somewhat pathetic 1.5 to 2 hours. Oh, well. Can't have it all, can we?SSD:While the SSD is an added option, I thought it would be a good idea to include it in a the review, because it is a serious option that many consider. First off, for those of you who don't know, an SSD, or solid state drive, is a replacement to the hard drive in your computer. It is basically a giant usb stick which has no moving parts, which means increased durability. To prove it, some Samsung engineers even dropped it from a building and it still worked. A SSD also increases the speed at which your computer accesses, reads, and writes data. Because there are no spinning platters, data is accessed much more quickly. And, as an added bonus, it is impervious to magnets. (To the best of my knowledge. I know what you're thinking, and PLEASE do not try it.)Design:This baby is a cold, hard, stunner. The black keys and trim around the display, coupled with the aluminum body and silver trackpad, are purely sexy. Top that off with a glowing white Apple logo, and ding! ding! ding! We have a winner. For me, its the little things that impress. The perfectly machined speaker holes and the hidden IR receiver and iSight camera really show how the brilliant folks at Apple stressed after every single detail, no matter how small or insignificant. In redesigning their notebook line, Apple showed that they make powerful machines. Not white, plastic toys. The only complaint that I have is that there is not enough difference between the designs of the MacBook, and MacBook Pro. I mean, speaking from a purely design point of view, why shell out a thousand dollars extra for something that looks just like the cheaper version?Performance:Lets start with the facts. On our Xbench tests, our MacBook Pro, as configured, scored a coveted 175. Lets compare this to the previous generation MacBook Pro, with 2 gigabytes of RAM, and a 2.4 gigahertz Core 2 Duo processor. That scored a 50.  Yeah, that's right. In the words of Steve Jobs, \"Its a screamer!\" Also, after throwing pretty much everything Main Stage and CS4 could throw at it, this puppy still didn't break a sweat. As a final test, we put Windows Vista Ultimate 64-Bit on it using boot camp. After taking all Windows Vista, the worlds most demanding operating system, had to throw at it, it scored a 5.7 out of 6 on the Vista Experience meter! This thing's unstoppable.Conclusion:After using this exceptional machine for a month, I am proud to report that it is worth every penny. It is truly worth an upgrade to anybody who can afford it. In addition, Apple's initiatives to make this notebook `green' make it even more appealing. This is destined to be a very, very, successful product.Alex Carlson-- The MacTips Podcast", "Date": "April 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great notebook", "Author": "P.

I recently bought a 24\" iMac (the $1799 model with the 120GTX discrete video RAM) and am loving it.I had a choice:  Spend $2500 for a Windows license of my Adobe products... or replace my Windows laptop with a Macbook.So I bought this Macbook.  Vista turned me off of Microsoft for good.  System requirements are asinine, which also means higher power requirements to do the same things I can do on the Mac.  I've worked with PCs ever since  Windows 1.0 -- and loathed the registry in Win95.  But I digress...  no more Windows.  I throw an Apple and broke the Windows.  :)I only mention price as a downer because the laptop has only 2GB of RAM and whose display contains a TN panel.  I was hoping for a M-PVA or better.  Still, looking directly at it, color shift is minimal.  Still, my iMac's H-IPS panel monitor blows it away in terms of gamut and shadow detail.  Not that 2GB is _bad_ or anything, but the screen was a disappointment for a $2000 notebook.As usual, OS X rocks.RAM is inexpensive, so to up this to 4GB is no ordeal.And I'll be honest:  This thing is light and has a very solid feel.  A comparable Windows laptop (think $1300) is twice as thick and needs far more than 2GB of RAM to make use of it.  I'd rather have efficiency and quality for a higher price than another piece o' junk to be upgraded all the time.I'll keep major photo editing on the iMac because of its superlative display (no $500 PC monitor even comes close; more TN garbage but larger so the flaws become even more apparent), but this is capable of most design work that doesn't require pinpoint color manipulation.

Bartley", "ReviewID": "R1WQNFF3LBTBA0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of these the day they were released.  However, every time I would get up from using my laptop for a drink or potty break, my wife would steal it!  She was hooked.  I told her that we had to get a laptop for her so that I could use mine.  We went to Best Buy and test-drove a few cheaper PC/Vista laptops.  None of them even remotely stacked up to the quality of the aluminum unibody MacBook Pro.  She -had- to have a 15.4\" widescreen LCD that could be viewed from sharper angles than sitting directly in front of the screen.  She -had- to have a backlit keyboard.  She -had- to have a glass, button-less touchpad.  That narrowed it down.  She -had- to have a 15\" unibody MacBook Pro.All-in-all, we love just about everything about our laptops.  My only complaint is the sharp edges.  The 90-degree edge where your wrists wrest is uncomfortable for any lengthy coding or writing sessions.  And the notch cut out in the middle below the touchpad has VERY sharp corners.  I have actually nicked myself a couple of times on it.I would actually give this laptop a 4.5 out of 5 because of the edges.  However, Amazon doesn't support half-stars, so I rounded up.Oh, and this laptop made me a \"switcher\".  I bought a Mac Mini as an HTPC a few years ago, but never used it much.  Now, with this laptop, I never touch either of my high-powered Vista gaming rigs.  Sure, gaming on a Mac leaves a lot to be desired, and I haven't had any luck with the virtualization software for gaming (VMware, Parallels), but that's not my primary usage.  I'm a web developer and use an array of applications.  If you're a hardcore PC person, give a Mac a spin.  You'll find you can do anything on a Mac that you can do on PC.

I cannot express how much I love this new aluminum (unibody) Macbook pro. The first thing I noticed when I got it was how gorgeous the LED screen was. I mean this is probably the best LCD I've ever seen. The colors are so vibrant and black levels are excellent. Yes, there are times when the glossy screen makes it difficult to see, but unless your always in a very bright room, the benefits of the glossy screen make it a much better screen. Its a pleasure watching 720p movies on this laptop. The 2.4 Ghz Core 2 duo is fast and should provide more than adequate processing power for most people. Its only 5.5 pounds and me being a college student,its very easy to carry around. I mainly chose the Macbook pro over the Macbook due to the screen size and a much better LCD screen. Don't be fooled, just because both screens are LED backlit, the panel is completely different. Overall, If you can afford one, pull the trigger and you will love it and have no regrets buying one.

Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop.That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as \"right-click,\" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) \"about a minute\" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.

Wouldn't want any other laptop, at least for a few more years.  I actually use the 2 GPU option more than I thought I would, I can pull 4 or 5 hours of battery life when I have it set to use the Geforce 9400 (Better Battery Life option), and get much better video performance when I switch it over to use the Geforce 9600 (better graphics performance option).  Can't go wrong with this thing, but remeber by default its set to use the lower end video.  I also love how this laptop is so small and thin, much smaller next to most 15\" laptops I've set it next too, including an older Dell I have.  The glass touchpad is also totally awesome (and I normally hate touch pads), I wish they'd make an external USB one that I could use on other computers, beats any other type of mouse I have ever used in the last 20 years, its basically the same tech as used with an iphone and ipod touch.I did find a bug, others have complained about on some boards, sometimes after using Sleep mode a lot, the fans will not get faster as the laptop gets hotter, which can lead to overheating and damage.  When using the high end video, which is when it mainly gets too hot, I always reset the SMC first, so the fans will work right.  You do this by turning the machine off, holding down the Shift, Control, and Option keys on the LEFT side of the keyboard, then pushing the power button, you can then let that all up, and then turn on the machine and the fans work fine until sleep is used again.  I expect sometime or another Apple will have a firmware update to make the SMC controlling the fans more reliable.  You can also download a free program called SMCfancontrol, where you can manually control your fans to make them spin faster for heat purposes if needed... but I've never even needed to worry about it when its using the low end 9400M video.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Made me into an Apple Convert from Windows", "Author": "Eagle Vision", "ReviewID": "R3L7OKJPVR55VJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this notebook to replace my pre-existing Windows XP based laptop.  Whenever I watched a movie and saw a celebrity working on a computer, it was always on a Mac.  When you buy a notebook like this, you are buying a Hollywood Superstar.  I debated between the Macbook and Macbook Pro but the Pro only weighs 0.1 lb more.  The Macbook Air does not have an optical drive so I could not see using that in the practical sense for travel (even though I infrequently use an optical drive beyond installation).WHAT IS IN THE BOXNotebookInstructionsAC AdapterSETUPWhen you turn on the notebook, there is an initialization process to register your notebook and allow you to password protect the computer.  Right out of the box, the Macbook Pro works well.  It is accompanied by iLife and iTunes.  I initially updated iTunes and updated the operating system after placing my information to work wirelessly.OperationFrom initial start up, I can access my desktop in about 40 seconds.  Shutdown is less than 10 seconds.  Sleep function turns on in less than 5 seconds and it goes to sleep in that period, too.  Forced quit shuts a window of a program that is not responding.The notebook is so easy to operate.  As a Windows operator since the Windows 1.0 inception, it was not a steep learning curve.  In lieu of the Control button, you push the Command button.The touchpad is generous and the various mouse gestures are a welcome addition.  The keyboard is full-sized and buttons are extremely comfortable.  The keyboard is very quiet but the space bar is ever so islightly noiser than the rest.The hard drive is quiet.  There is no screen flex or wrist pad flex, either.  The function keys control contrast, volume and screen brightness.  Being used to a Dell Latitude D620, I am used to about a 50% brightness.  Configured with a 320 GB hard drive that is a lot of space to store my 120 GB of music and over 100 GB of photos/videos.  The hard drive appears to run fast at 5400 RPM (for what I do a 7200 RPM HD was not worth it).I do not game but I wanted the option given the video capabilities.  However, to conserve energy I use the integrated memmory card.  If I decide one day to play video games, this notebook will afford me that ability.Installation of programs have never been easier for me on a Mac than my previous 5 generations of Windows based notebooks (ranging from Dell, Gateway, HP, Compaq).  I was able to install my printer software and drivers in 1/3 of the time of XP and 1/5 of the time from Vista.  Password protecting the notebook, ensured that only I would be able to install ANYTHING onto my notebook.  It is so frustrating when someone uses your computer only to find junky software installed into your notebook which add spyware and run your computer less efficiently.ConstructionThe solid construction by the aluminum body is elegant and durable.  The glass screen is highly reflective but at the angle by which I operate the notebook, I find no problems.  It is so easy to wipe off.  I have read that viewing angles were limited but I don't find that to be the case for me (with regular positioning and use).For the size of a widescreen 15.4\" notebook, this design is thin and lightweight (5.5 lbs) which matches the weight of many notebooks at the 14.1\" size of Windows based notebooks.I use this notebook on a table or my lap.  It does not get hot like prior generations of Macbook Pros which got very uncomfortably hot.The plug attaches by a magnetic type interface which is easy to use and more durable than other notebook interfaces that tend to dislodge from regular use (My old Gateway and an older model Compaq).There are 2 USB ports, a Firewire 800 port, earphone and microphone jacks, and a monitor port.  A slot for the optical drive is convenient and is software/hardware driven.  It is relatively quiet for its operation.  I do not even hear the cooling fan when it runs.Integrated webcam with very good field of view and resolution for its size.  Using the camera it is easy to do videoconferencing or video chatting (iChat).  The video chat also works with Google's Chat interface.BatteriesThe battery is unlike the batteries of its predecessors.  I ordered the older battery and obviously, it would not fit.Battery life is decent with WIFI and Bluetooth inactivated and brightness set to lower levels, allowing me about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I love how you can display batter life as a percentage or absolute time.Wifi and Bluetooth activation are easy to operate (at the upper right hand corner of the screen).  I can log in quickly from anywhere.  I just click on the Wireless icon at the top right hand corner to see what networks are available and I am online.  It was not so simple with Windows.ProgramsArmed with the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) and iLife '08 (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand), you can do a lot with the notebook right out of the box.  I did purchase extra software for more versatility:Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Special Media EditionFinal Cut Express 4Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)I had Windows XP before and syncing the IPOD with that system was well, buggy.  With the Macbook Pro, as soon as I turned on the notebook, the updates ran seamlessly and did not affect the performance of the machine.  I also decided to sync my notebook with the Macbook Pro which was very easy and I had not one error.  I also found it faster to sync with my IPOD when compared to my Windows based predecessor.  Overall, it was a more positive experience for me.The Dashboard has useful applets with more to download from the Apple web site.  Things like movie theater times, snowfall repots, conversions, weather, a dictionary, thesaurus, and calendar (just to name a few) that don't require the browser but may need internet access.  The Widgets are very useful.My favorite is the 'movie theater times' since I just activate Dashboard, I can check the theater and movie and I am done in less than a minute (it is like a virtual newspaper).Spaces is a great feature for me.  It allows me to switch to different windows to see what program is running without clutter.  It is like having a four foot screen with all of the windows.PROSLightweight for the size of the screenThin profileNext generation trackpad (works similar to an iPhone/IPOD TouchEase of operation and installation of programsGood base of programs installedVirtually no BLOATWARESimplicity of designCan run windowsDual video card configurationSpacesCONSCostAverage battery lifeNo matte screen optionI also added the Applecare Protection Plan (3 year duration) which I was advised will be worth the price for technical support and repairs (if necessary).  I highly recommend getting the Protection Plan:AppleCare Protection Plan MA515LL/A for MacBook Pro (w/ or w/o display)One peripheral that I thought was very useful was the Apple Remote which I found new on the Amazon Marketplace for $5:Apple Remote Control for iPod (White)ConclusionOverall, this is a solid notebook with the capabilities to run Windows (but why?).  The design is simple and easy to use.It has made an Apple convert out of me, out of all of these years (23 years - am I that old?) of PC computing from the IBM AT/XT days (monochrome screens, 5 inch floppy drives, 2400 baud modems, noisy dot matrix printers and clicky keyboards).I highly recommend this product.

Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean \"for professionals\"  this is definitely not the case anymore.  No button on the trackpad \"neato\" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.

I needed to get an Apple computer so I could develop Apple Apps for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. So, I did lots of research to find the best bang for the buck thinking the only thing I need this device for is to just to make these apps at work. I can't lie though, I knew that Xcode wouldn't be the only thing this laptop was capable of doing. So, when it arrived, I booted it up and immediately tried to familiarize myself with how it operated. I have had almost NO Apple experience in the last 10 years. From my research I learned that there were certain things that were a requirement for my Apple purchase. I MUST have a 64-bit processor to stay up with the times and with Apple phasing things out. I MUST have either Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion. This laptop came with Snow Leopard. From the reviews I read, Snow Leopard is probably the preferred OS for this machine so I think I am going to keep it on here since it's working great.So now that you know my background and primary usage a little bit I will explain to you my thoughts as a technology enthusiast.Cosmetically, I think this laptop is really beautiful. It feels well built, I really like the glowing keys, and the glossy screen has a beautiful display. I am a matte screen lover but hey what can ya do. I have a lot of matte screen laptops, can't hurt to have a glossy one too. The glossy screen certainly isn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker for using or wanting this laptop.The first hour using the laptop I was glued to Safari searching how to do this and how to do that. I was impressed with how responsive this laptop was with every command I threw at it. I think my first session on this laptop lasted around 4 hours, and in that short 4 hours I learned how to download software, mount and install software, eject the .dmg image file, clean up my storage, understand where files are installed and how they are accessed, manage my Applications, run virtual operating systems with Vmware Fusion, how to emulate windows applications with Wine, and multitask using the many different finger swipe methods available. I like very much that Snow Leopard is an Apple/Unix combo.. what I mean is I love having access to Terminal! I was scared of how quickly I was becoming addicted to the laptop. Two things I'm still not used to about Apple/Snow Leopard but realize I just have to deal with are: No print screen button & moving files is a little weird (unless you memorize the keyboard shortcut). Again, not deal breakers, but as a web designer nothing to me is more useful than the Print Screen button.All in all, this laptop runs extremely smooth, is very fun to use, looks cool when I use it, and is a powerhouse of so many options. Surf the web, create Apple apps, do video editing, do photo editing, create art, chat with friends, do it all! Do it all at the same time! This laptop won't care it'll just keep multitasking. The only time I could feel it slow down a little is when I had 3 virtual operating systems running at the same time (Windows 7, Mountain Lion, and Windows XP) but even then it kept going, it just wasn't reallllly happy that I wanted to do all that at one time hahaDo I recommend this laptop? Yes. It's definitely a pleasurable laptop to use. You will definitely get many great hours of enjoyment out of it. Personally, I still feel more comfortable doing my actual web work and code on a Windows machine, but it's a wonderful thing to have both options at my finger tips. The macbook pro is a GREAT communication device (social media, chat, etc) and internet surfer, now THAT is for sure.

Then again, I don't have a window behind me. The positive thing about the screen is the richness of colors... Apple has talked about \"lickability\" for years, and that's what I see with this screen.The case is rock solid. No quality problems that I have seen. I did open it to upgrade the RAM, and it was a pain finding a small-enough screwdriver for the 8 screws that I had to remove. That is my only complaint.

At home I have a Logitech wireless external keyboard and mouse, a Western Digital Firewire 800 external drive, and a 22\" HP Flat Widescreen Monitor, so it is almost like having a desktop only cooler. I am a dual OS user (Windows/Mac) and I also have both OS on my Mac. Mac OS is by far the superior operating system. But, this computer runs Windows XP and Windows 7 (beta) fast. That's the good thing about a Mac, you can natively run Windows without emulation software, so there is nothing sucking up the processor power! Of course you can use VM Ware or Parallels if you want to run WIndows while running Mac OS which is also cool, but just not as fast. So, for all the people who cry about how expensive the Mac is, IT IS TWO COMPUTERS IN ONE, a Windows machine, a Mac, and  if you want to run Linux that too. Everything runs flawlessly in windows as long as it is either USB or firewire. I also upgraded my wireless router to an \"N\" device, and let me tell you, the router is in my basement and I am two flights up. I get a faster connection than with my ethernet cable plugged in (running 100 Mbps). My next upgrade will be an Time Capsule, though part of my external drive is partitioned for Time Machine, which works quietly on its own in the background.When I go out with my MacBook Pro I never had any problem connecting to Public WiFi networks. The computer simply finds what's available and asks you if you want to connect, it's easier than Windows wireless connections. I also must admit, that when going places, this is the machine you want to be seen with, it is just attractive. So far I haven't seen anyone else with this machine at the places I bring it, I see mostly older MacBook Pros, but the \"Black\" keys give away that you have the newer model, not to mention the slim aluminum case. The keys are lit from behind for dark locations, shut off in bright locations to save battery, and dim accordingly as the light changes. There is also manual control, but the automatic works fine. Same with the screen brightness. It adjusts automatically according to the lighting of the environment you are currently in. There is also manual adjustment, but I never touch it. It also dims during periods of inactivity to save battery power. The screen itself is just awesome, the best laptop screen out there. I am a fan of glossy screens, to me it just makes the picture more vibrant, so those who like the matte screen might be disappointed, since this model does not that.The NVidia Graphics in this machine is top notch too, I use this laptop for video, and with the high graphics turned on, this laptop does a great job. A quick note though, if you are on battery power you will definitely want to just use the integrated graphics mode, since this will almost double the runtime. You will also want to turn off the bluetooth radio, since this also eats up a lot of juice. It's best to bring the power adapter if you plan on doing video or picture editing or heavy bluetoothing.When I go out, I use the trackpad, and leave the mouse at home. You get use to the pad quickly, including the gestures and lack of any buttons, it is quite intuitive.

In any case, it runs beautifully.I've really come to appreciate the extra screen real estate, and the display quality of the MBP.  We own a mid-2008 20\" iMac 2.66Ghz and the screen is every bit as good of quality; I really feel like the Macbook Pro is like a \"portable iMac\" in terms of speed and display quality.  It's that good!Lastly, I had a chance to pick up Apple's DisplayPort -> VGA adapter since I will need to hook this notebook up to a LCD projector more than a few times next semester.  The dongle is not cheap but does what it says it will without any fuss.  To test it, I hooked it up to my 42\" 1080i HDTV and it looked beautiful, no interference or pixelation.Two weeks later, this little guy is still working every bit as good as the day I bought it.  :-)--For the past few weeks, I've been shopping for a new notebook computer.  I've owned/used Mac in the past, but am comfortable in both worlds; I prefer Mac, but can get along fine in Windows too.I inevitably ended up with the 15\" Macbook Pro 2.66Ghz because of the sheer size, weight, and performance.  After I spent some time actually touching/using all the competing brands, I came to the following conclusion--you truly do get what you pay for.Some would argue that Macs are too expensive and not worth the hefty cost over their Windows/PC counterparts. Moreover, they would also say that you're paying extra for the fancy-shmancy design and chimp-simple ease of use, not to mention feeding into the smugness of the Mac community.However, my wife and I have owned Macs for the last few years, and I've had a really good experience owning Apple computers.One thing I noticed immediately is the build quality; it's amazing, and very well made.  When you pick up the computer, it feels very rigid and sturdy; it really does feel like a solid piece of equipment compared to other notebooks.The fans are very quiet and the unit seems to regulate heat/temperature very well.  When I turn it on, the Macbook 'bonggggg' sound is the only thing I hear, and cannot hear the hard drive at all.  It's probably the quietest computer I've ever owned.I've not owned this unit long enough (less than 36hrs) to give a more detailed example, but I'm very delighted with the performance in iMovie and iPhoto '09.  It's VERY fast.All in all, whether you choose the 2.4Ghz or 2.6Ghz, it's a great investment in a notebook computer.

I think all those that complain about VISTA should use a mac w. OS X and see how quick they run back to windows just to have the capatability and limitless computing options again and not be limited to only what comes from Apple.

The NEW Macbook Pro 15.4 inch does look nice, is high quality made, etc.Pros:1.Mousepad is very cool.2.Design is very nice. It is pretty light.3.Sound is pretty good.4.Magnetic battery plug is awesome.5.Battery life is amazing and can be charged 1000 times.6.Slot-loading DVD drive is great.7.Keypad is pretty nice and backlit.8.Fantastic quality iCamera.Cons: The reasons I am returning this product.1.When you type in wordpad, and try to print it, it is so small not even a magnifying glass could fix.  I tried messing around with the word wrap and stuff, but with the price of this notebook, this is not right.2.Price3.Latch on back is almost too easy to open and get to the hard drive, etc.4.Only 2 USB Ports, what are they thinking?5.No HDMI Port6.Hardly any products are made for MAC still, they are all windows only.7.Text in Safari is very hard to read just like Textedit.I've read all the reviews on the laptop and I feel that most people are just Mac Fanboys and don't give honest reviews.  I am not one sided when it comes to computers because we have apple and microsoft products and I love them both for their own reasons.  I am just disappointed with this Macbook Pro because, while the performance is pretty good, the Cons far outweigh the Pros for this notebook.  I am getting a Dell XPS 16 which has like 4 usb ports, hdmi port, backlit keyboard, leather on the casing, finger scanner, protective case, HD SCreen.  It just makes much more sense to get more quality of a product and have more things work with it.  I paid about 1300.00 for the Dell XPS 16 and I paid 1800.00 for the Macbook Pro.  While Apple makes great products, Dell's laptops feel just as nice for a much lower price.  Maybe in the future Mac will fix a few issues and more things will work with it.  Until that time, I am sticking with Windows.  PS (This is an unbiased review, so read it with confidence that you are getting honest feedback).
