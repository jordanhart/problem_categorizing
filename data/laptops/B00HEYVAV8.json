I purchased it when I was sure that Microsoft would not back off from their arbitrary end date for XP.  Not wanting (or needing) a touch screen machine and needing some additional processing power, this Lenovo fits the bill.  I paid $40 less for it than the current price and I guess that has to do with supply and demand. It was a short learning curve to move from XP to Windows 7 and I transferred data using a Clickfree backup device.

I was delighted that Amazon had a nice selection.  The stores only seem to have Windows 8.  I suppose I could have had one custom made.  I loved the feel of the Keyboard, and I loved the way that heat was exhausted out of the sides of the base instead of the bottom  It never got hot....but...This computer came loaded with countless spyware programs that I said no to installing.  I still got others that made using the computer difficult.  They seemed to take over the screen and my work.  They would not fully uninstall, even when using a very good uninstaller.  It took over 2 weeks to find and remove all the traces of those programs.  Even so, those programs did not dissuade me from using the computer and keeping it, as that would be temporary... but..The cursor, when using the track pad kept getting stuck.  I went into the configuration/settings to find out how to remedy this several times to no avail.  It continued to show a wheel instead of the arrow.  I could only proceed by moving my finger around the trackpad to free it.  I felt like I was shaking it loose.  This really slowed down my work which, at this point only consisted of setting up the computer.  The HELP feature did not address this.  Lenovo support had no solutions either.  I was beginning to think this was to be expected.... BUTthen the computer kept resetting itself while I was working.  I had the power options set to NEVER turn off, NEVER sleep, NEVER hibernate, yet the screen repeatedly returned to the lock screen.  I finally decided that It should not work this way.  I hate sending things back, but that was what I did.  The return process was very easy.  UPS even came the next day to pick it up.  The only thing I recommend is to save all your packaging.  Although I don't fault the brand at all, and am sure that other units don't act like this, I jumped over to another higher rated brand.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "great laptop", "Author": "L.
