We tried window 8 for her but since no one in my family has much experience with 8 - we found it easier to try to teach her on one we are all familiar with.  Great computer for the money.  Needed to be defraged to speed it up a bit but works like a charm.", "Date": "August 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "WOW !!!
