{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good unit, as described, great communication from the seller", "Author": "Howard", "ReviewID": "R2WJ8DCH6F2CRC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was my first foray into buying a refurbished ANYTHING, and was done with some apprehension.  The product, sold by an Amazon affiliated seller and not Amazon directly, was extremely responsive to a special request for shipping, and the unit (one week after delivery, admittedly, so the long term prognosis isn't finalized) seems to work perfectly, exactly as described in the selling points on Amazon.  Dollar-for-dollar, this is a great unit.  The screen is a bit on the small side, and I don't think I'd pay the full price for a new unit, and probably would have opted for a larger-screen more economic model.  As a refurbished unit though, for the price this was a great deal.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$647.99", "Features": "Intel  1.5 GHz\n4 GB DDR3\n500 GB 5400 RPM Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 8", "Name": "Acer Aspire V5-571P-6490 16-Inch Laptop (1.5GHz  Intel Core i3-2375M processor, 4GB DDR3 memory, 500GB hard drive, Windows 8 64-bit) Matte Silver", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41YdkrZgpeL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00CYVZCG0"}}
