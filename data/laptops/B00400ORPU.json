It is lightning fast,and I don't have to wait and wait for things to appear.  Very light (I wish I could open it with one hand, though) and easy to move.

This was my third Dv7 from HP (customized 2 & were order from HP, 1 ordered from amazon) and they all had the same issues: Windows 7 runs ok but, it causes a sound problem for the laptop. The ACPI.sys file (in Windows 7) causes real-time audio skips, jumps, and cracks. That means when you listen to a song (i.e. on iTunes), stream music, watch a blu-ray movie, or a video on youtube, you will experince sound glitchs throughout the playtime. Second, programs run slower when ac adapter is plugged in. Next, the batterlife is ok but, it's not close to 5 hours. And thats running on \"power saver\" option. Then, the laptop get very hot, even with being lifted little with the 9-cell battery. Finally, HP customer care tech support is CRAP. Their techs have no idea what they are doing. They are extremely poorly trained, you get the absolute run around with trouble-shooting any issue and they are located in India so it is diffcult to understand them. You can tell they are reading off a script, when trouble-shooting your issue and calls get dropped alot.I looked up some forums on the internet, and alot of ppl are having very simlar or the same problems, especially with HP's customer service.Now I dont know if you going to have the same issue(s) with yours, I'm just saying 3 of mines did..", "Date": "December 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "not worth the price", "Author": "Yelekeri \"mahesh yelekeri\"", "ReviewID": "R1VMOFY5YP2FYB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I saw the specs of the laptop I was so excited, couldn't wait to get hold of it. But after using it for a few weeks, really very disappointed.Pros: - Internet browsing is a breeze, page loading is really super fast - In spite of someone mentioned that the keyboard is not so good, I do like the keyboard layout, its strong and you have the confidence that it would not break so easily.Cons: - I cannot, let me be very clear, I cannot use the mouse pad at all, its completely erraraneous and very hard. So I am using a wireless mouse. Most of the time I find the mouse first and then look where I kept the laptop. - display sucks, just forget about clarity - finger print reader is a nuasance. 4 out of 5 times it doesn't work. So to login to the machine, I do have to scan my finger, wait for it to process (probably 4-5 seconds), scan my finger again ..... and at one time it works. What the hell, just type the password. - audio did stuttered a few times, I thought its the music file itself. But the same song works fine in the same laptop. - No firewire or usb3.0 ports!", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not as a fast I thought, but it is ok...", "Author": "LUIS RAUL", "ReviewID": "R1ZO4IEGTFF4SO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The size, is great.The details about the \"argento style\" is very good.The size of the disc is for my needs.The the hertz of the cpu is ok.The battery life, it is almost 5 hours...not 5.25, but it is ok.The fact to have blu-ray is a good advantage for movies.The kind of video card... is not the best.... it is a medium kind, do not support physx, but with the appropiate driver could support stereographic for 3d (haven't found yet but the specs says it support), this card was one of the first one in the world to support Directx 11 for laptops.Not as a fast as I thought for 6gb on memory, but still it is fast.Overall great laptop for the price.No problems yet!!!!!!!", "Date": "November 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Waste of Money....", "Author": "Akeem", "ReviewID": "R39CCXYXQSYXFZ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop as a replacement to a Toshiba that I had purchased that was recalled and I regret having purchased this laptop.

I had a pavilion dv6, got some troubles but decided to try again the hp pavilions. This year I buyied this notebook. intel i7, 6GB, 1TB, etc.. what could I hope? A great notebook, but I don`t know what HP had done, they was able to put all this characteristics of cpu, mem, etc and build a very bad product. Well, to start, 2 months after buy it, the wired network failed. More 1 month and the processor keeps at very high temperature. A simple youtube video or mp3 and the cpu goes to 80C. If I keeps watching the video, it reaches ~105C and auto-shutdown. Obviously that the cooler try to do its job, not without a big noise, but it is not enough. At the end of the day, I buyied a machine that must be replaced soon. Never more with HP. For now on, I will try Dell or Apple. If you are thinking about buy this notebook, please check for more reviews. Don`t let him impress you with i7,x-GB, y-TB. Read carefully the reviews and buy a descent machine.", "Date": "August 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "I really wanted to love this thing!!!", "Author": "D.

This thing is lightening fast which is awesome and no matter what I throw at it will keep clocking.So, I have had it now for about 2 months and here are my pros/cons:PROS: fast, reliable, good battery life, good screen resolution, nice audio for video conferencingCONS: There is no light to tell you if the num lock is on or off, the keys are not the friendliest for ladies hands even with short nails, THE MOUSE PAD IS AWFUL!!!So, to elaborate, there is no scrolling function for navigating webpages (though once in awhile it will do it so I guess there might be a way I just don't know how to do it), the buttons are hard to push and I find that after filing some 1000 emails around in Outlook that I receive each week, my fingers ache and I long for my old HP mouse (similar to the one pictured where they show the fingerprint reader)Overall, I feel like it was a fair purchase but it was not worth what I paid for it at all, I am overall disappointed but I am now stuck with it :(UPDATE: Almost one year later...I still hate this laptop and I am considering buying a MAC this thing locks up all the time, the fan won't stop running despite every BIOS update that HP has put out, all the letters have worn off the keys, it crashes all the time and the mousepad is still nightmare...overall still very disappointed in a $1200 machine.

Very nice design, very thin (considering that is HP).The only thing on hardware that is pretty annoying, is the fact that for this price i spect FULL HD (please HP 17.3 inches) and the lack of Bluetooth.ok, now comes the rude stuff:  I see silver on the product images, but i don't know why they ship me a soft purple (thanks a lot now i can find the soft side of my manliness).

The display screen on these machines has the worst off axis view-ability I've seen since the first LCD screens hit the market.The concept of integrating the mouse buttons under the touch pad was singly the most poop brained idea anyone's had in computer design in... forever! The entire surface is active all the time so it constantly gets confused over which finger is doing what. And there's no option to disable tapping on the control surface, which I INSIST on being able to disable. The single finger approach is no better as touching the button are (which is part of the pad surface)causes the pointer to move and on small buttons or those fine box borders, this is absolutely maddening!I thought those issues were bad enough until the machine literally just rebooted in the middle of writing this!
