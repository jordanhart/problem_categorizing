This one has the newer generation I5 processor and is very quick.  The touchscreen is immediate and accurate.  I have a business laptop with Windows 8 touchscreen which crawls in comparison to this.  So far very pleased, have had it about a month now.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap plastic case that breaks shortly after purchase.  Toshiba won't warranty & charges new computer price to repair.", "Author": "Mom from Minnesota", "ReviewID": "RL4Y3N27V6SY5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Don't waste your money.  Computer itself works well but has 2 major flaws.  1st one is the driver for the wireless card goes out on a regular basis & you have to keep reinstalling it in order to get wifi.  If you call customer support (even in the first week after purchase) they will tell you it is a software issue & not even walk you through how to fix it.  Google provides good instructions, so you can get past that.Worst problem is the case is made from cheap plastic.  4 months after purchase we noticed the sides of the screen were separating slightly.  After a couple of weeks, the hinge just snapped & there is now a 1 inch gap between the screen & the back of the laptop exposing the delicate computer components.  Our laptop is less than 6 months old & is sitting at the Toshiba warranty center right now.  They want $502.58 to fix what should be warrantied.  The laptop has never been dropped or mistreated in any way & Toshiba refuses to back up their product.  We even took pictures before mailing it in to prove that there were no dents, scratches or anything to indicate mistreatment.If you google toshiba laptop problems, although this model doesn't come up yet (it will eventually), you will see that the hinge problem has been an issue with them for years.  Save your money & stick with the established brands.  Most important, make sure your new laptop does not have a plastic case.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Everything I was looking for in a computer.", "Author": "Marguerite Lind", "ReviewID": "R307PEKQ8QMNO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast and everything I was looking for in a computer. I can watch my dvds without having to attach a separate remote player. Graphics are clear and sharp thanks to the 1080p screen. The touch screen is something new for me to get used to but I do like it and am getting more familiar with it every day.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect... everything I need in a laptop.", "Author": "Dealinthebag", "ReviewID": "R14R9XY5TPMHL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Backlit keyboard, firm keys that don't feel like they're going to break when I type, smooth pointerpad, clear screen, and the touch screen has worked very well, too.What I use my laptop for: documentation on patient charting (which requires a heck of a lot of clicking with the wireless mouse I added), web surfing, watching Amazon Instant Videos, and emailing.  The documentation for my patients is why this laptop helps so much- the touchscreen comes in handy when I have to enlarge a screen to read the small print or when its much easier to scoll and pick answers with touch screen vs. using the mouse.  The two options allow for great efficiency, in that case.  The touch screen has also helped with enlarging pics on Amazon when the zoom button just doesn't seem like enough to see a product/item more clearly.(I will not be reviewing Windows, that's an entirely different kind of review)The laptop itself is fast for my use, light enough to carry around in my backpack when I'm riding my motorcycle, and the backlighting makes it so much easier to type when I'm in front of the TV at night.Quality sound from the harman/kardon speakers for music, listening to radio talk heads, and video watching.  I have no complaints.  It even looks slick.  I'm very happy with this product.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00E5R6RE2"}}
