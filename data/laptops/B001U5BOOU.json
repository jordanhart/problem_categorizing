The near pristine computer was sent in just a couple of days in a one rate box.  All of the accessories were included.  This was just a fantastic item with a truly fair price.  I have a lot of admiration for a Seller who can pull off the deal, and hit all the bases.  Thank you to a 5 STAR Seller!  This computer is slim but very sturdy, fast, and easy to see.  The tracking works great and the XP Pro is exactly what I was looking for.  The D400 is wifi.  I'm so glad I found this Dell!", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B001U5BOOU"}}
