I purchased this pavilion because it was(at the time) under 400 dollars.  Windows 8 takes some getting used to, but I haven't experienced many frustrations once I downloaded chrome.  Firefox and Internet Explorer did have some strange issues and once in a while took some time to open(which I think is a windows 8 issue) so I downloaded chrome, adobe flash, open office and have been using my new computer mostly hassle free.I would recommend this computer to anyone who is going on the internet, word processing, streaming videos, and saving pictures and movies.  I don't know if it's good for gaming or putting together videos.  I wouldn't pay the 450 or whatever price it is now for this computer due to some of the hardware limitations.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "I call it my Cadillac Laptop.", "Author": "leslie benjamin", "ReviewID": "R1XRRIWEHGZDQE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is awesomely fast and terribly pretty to look at.

I'll sink my money into a Dell or an Apple, instead.I was told HPs were better than Dells, but that's not the case with this laptop. Aside from all the problems with Windows 8, the touch pad on this always switched between hyper-responsive and non-responsive. Sometimes the system would boot quickly, sometimes super slow. I would get \"high system use\" warnings right out of the box, before anything was even processing. The Norton software that came with it worked sporadically, but wouldn't even finish a full scan most of the time.It's a lightweight and attractive design, but it stops there.

Selected this model because of the slightly bigger hard drive 640, USB 3 ports and still has a dvd read/write drive. I also wanted to go with Windows 8 since I had not upgraded since XP. Setup was very easy and Wi Fi connection worked with no problems. Windows Office is installed but not activated. Bought the activation code and Office installed with no problems.Windows 8 has pluses and minuses. It loads quickly and you can customize the Startup screen to your liking for quick access. The touch pad takes some getting used to and I do not like the first screen that comes up in Windows 8 that does nothing for you! I bought an HP printer 6510 e model (wireless) also through Amazon for a great price and it installed fine.I did have some crashes prior to the last Windows (never ending) updates that caused me some problems. I had the wireless printer working fine until I think I did an HP support assistant update when I lost direct printing. I did a painfully slow system restore to the day before and the computer is happy again. Really unsure what caused the problem in the first place.Also I do not care for the Windows Pictures App on the start page for importing pictures or for that matter looking at them. But there are plenty of other picture programs out there. Battery Life is good, audio is good and the performance is good. I like it!

The computer had problems initially loading Windows 8 and it took a couple tries.  Trying to get Microsoft Office full version loaded was a huge problem with many shutdowns, freezups and error messages.  I couldn't install the HP Help and spent hours trying to get help.  The online chat for Hp did not solve the problem and referred me to microsoft help because my laptop wouldn't install office even though it will also not install Hp automated helper (not sure if that is the correct name) or Hp updates.  I still have not worked out the installation problem.  My mouse arrow freezes often doing very simple tasks and it has shut down out of the blue...it even froze and shut down during an angry birds game. It will not recognize a usb plugin mouse.  And these are just the problems I have encountered in my first 4 uses.  I am so beyond frustrated.  I just want to use this laptop for basic use, nothing fancy.  I can only think that the particular laptop I received is defective because this cannot be normal!  I love the solidness of this laptop and the keyboard (although mine has a couple warped keys that I don't think is normal?!)  I do really like the mousepad texture and sensitivity.

I had two HP desk tops in my life and loved them both.  I really have no complaints about the computer.  The keyboard is a little flimsy but I love the 10 key addition for easy number entry.  The problem with this computer is the Windows 8 operating system.  It's really made for a touch screen net book, not a lap top.  The mouse pad is horrid and is constantly zooming in and out and adding \"chiclets\" to my screen or taking them away.  I can't attach photos to my e-mail, can't find anything I saved and that start up screen is a complete waste of time.  I'd recommend the computer ONLY if you could get a different operating system.  If I could get rid of it, I would.Since my initial review I have two additional complaints.  Six weeks after purchase, my sound card was gone.  Spent 45 minutes on the phone with HP trying to get it back.  Additionally, I was never able to play a CD, let alone burn one so it ended up with an IT guy just last week trying to address that issue.

I think the interface is made more for a touch screen and found myself going back to the classic desktop, but I can see the allure for the younger crowd, who have smart phones, liking it.  I have a 17\" g70 and love it, so this one has a bit smaller screen but still has the number keypad, which I like very much.  I didn't get a chance to see if the battery lasted a long time or not.

I was looking for an inexpensive replacement for my Dell Inspiron)1525 that I liked very much except for the fact that it kept breaking every three months (that's another story). I found the HP Pavillion g6 meets my needs very well. In a nutshell I like:- The cost (<$500)- The sound (Sound is better than on the dell)- Minimum of pre-loaded crap- I spend most of my time plugged in but battery life seems pretty decent.-  It has a separate numeric keypadOn the downside:- The display sucks compared to the Dell. Peripheral viewing drops off quickly. Overall barely acceptable.- Keyboard. Readability of the keyboard is poor, especially in low light. Keyboard feel is \"chicletty\" and cheapish.- Although it's perfectly adequate overall performance is not as good as the Dell. I'm not sure why, processor and memory are comparable. Probably Windows 8.Speaking of Windows 8, I was hesitant to buy a PC with Windows 8 preloaded. Windows Vista and I had reached a happy compromise and I wasn't looking forward to learning what all those tiles did. My fears were unfounded, I've drunk the Windows 8 kool aid. Although I spend 90% of my time using the desktop view I get the tile thing and see why they would be useful on a touchscreen tablet. I'm even considering replacing my old Android phone with a Windows phone at my next upgrade, just for the consistent user interface.In summary I'm very satisfied with my purchase.

They are TERRIFIC.  My machine arrived with a defective dvd drive.  I registered the machine before I realized this, which I now realize was a good thing.  HP's service is exemplary.  They promptly shipped me the replacement drive.  It is now installed, and  the machine is running very well.  I could have returned the machine for them to replace it, but I knew I could get this done, and it saved time. I am so pleased with my purchase and the service I received that I recommended HP to a family member who purchased one of their other machines.For the price this machine is exceptional.  I am not into games or graphics, so I can't comment on how it would perform in that category.  The USB3 ports are fast.  The machine has a comfortable keyboard and a good screen.Windows 8 hides things.  I have been told that their next update or upgrade (not sure which) will put the start menu back.  You have to poke around to find things.  Try right clicking in different places.  Menus change with small changes in the cursor location.  I uninstalled a lot of the stuff that was unnecessary and which was offers to buy stuff.  Windows 8 is not a bad program EXCEPT that it's hard to FIND things at first.  If you are determined, you can learn this program reasonably quickly, but I have been doing computers since Dos 3.11 before Windows was ever invented, so I do have a bit of an edge.  The aps page isn't bad, but I move to the regular desktop which is where I normally work from.  However, if you want to go back and forth from that to the aps page, it's easy to do and very helpful in many situations.Also in Windows 8, the right hand pop out menu changes depending on where you are, and from the aps page, if you move your cursor to the right to open the right pop out, then click on \"tiles,\" you can tell it to open a bigger list of aps, and you can find a lot of the programs that do machine maintenance, etc.  However, if you are a beginner, be a little careful with those.  Also, you can find stuff in the programs directory from the file manager.HP HAS DONE SOMETHING WONDERFUL.  If you are a keyboard user and do a lot of typing, it is VERY handy that the touchpad can be turned  off with two light taps on a little indentation in the upper left corner of the touchpad.  Can be turned back on the same way, so you don't have to worry about what you are typing suddenly changing size or taking off into the wild blue yonder.  VERY handy.  Kudos to HP.The Windows 8 email program is horrible.  It seems to work well until you go to forward something, and then it gets messy.  As best I can figure out, you have to select what you want to forward, and that is like pouring molasses in January.  Then it doesn't always work.  When I tried to move something into a special folder, which should work, the machine froze.  If the email is open, and it seems to be open ALL the time, then I got an error message when I restarted the machine that windows couldn't access something.  That wasn't helpful, since the message disappeared so quickly I couldn't read it.  Without that email program set up, I don't get an error message.  Without the email program, the machine is working great.My suggestion is to delete all your email accounts, if you have set any up.  Use your email provider's web site, or, if you want to do your email on your machine, get a different program.  There are two reasons for this:  1. security  and 2. the program is lousy.About security, the very first thing I do when I turn on my machine is update my Norton's Internet Security.  If you have set up an account using the Windows 8 email program, you machine is online before you can get a security update, and you are not as fully protected as you should be if email comes in, as it almost surely will.I have already said the program drove me nuts, because it didn't work well.  I am perfectly happy working on the web site for my email, and that also avoids downloading a lot of spam and risking hostile files or viruses getting to your machine.  If you do use a machine based email system, I highly recommend Norton's security programs.  They have stopped bad emails from getting to my older machine, where I was using machine based email.  Obviously you have to do your own thinking about phishing emails, but Norton will stop hostile files and viruses fast.I hope this review helps people deciding whether or not to buy this machine.  It is an excellent machine for normal activities.  For running high end graphics, you need something bigger -- and more expensive -- but this machine is faster and does more than older desktops, and I like it a lot.If you have a problem, contact HP support.  They have a regular specified routine they go through, and if you will bear with them,they will help you as fast as they can.  Have a little patience, and they WILL solve your difficulties.  They certainly have done a wonderful job for me.  And it's not their fault you are frantic because you machine is pitching a hissy fit.Hope this review is helpful.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "great laptop", "Author": "youthminadam", "ReviewID": "R251MMY7NG7Z5N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used to have dell thy broke twice for no reason and got this one and it's been work great and is excellent for school work.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "gift to self", "Author": "La Sana Groome", "ReviewID": "R2F3GTQRS0URUC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this was a great deal price and it works exceptionally well. i wish it automatically came with microsoft office though", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "New", "Author": "Esther Berry", "ReviewID": "R12HN68RS808AC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Not performing as I expected it too, having problems with it being to slow and unable to hold connection, not sure if its the computer it self or the windows program that is making it function poorly.", "Date": "August 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Runs like a champ...with the right software", "Author": "Keith Livio", "ReviewID": "R11GDMMFXY3B44", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a laptop with exact the specification that this laptop had...15 inch, larger keyboard, decent graphics (beyond the embedded) and the right cost, given we will be seeing next generation hardware come out at any moment.

Though others may blame Windows 8 for this issue, its actually the complete nonsense that HP loads on top of Windows 8 that drags things down. My recommendation is to take your new laptop to the nearest IT geek, and ask them to reinstall the operating system before use. You can also try decrapifier, a program that will help scrub your system. Follow these steps, and your new HP laptop will zip along just fine.One note...if you are a Farmville fan, this laptop is not for you.

I have never been able to successfully connect wirelessly with my printer.  Now after about 2 years, entire folders disappear.  What do I mean by that?  Well you can go to Windows Explorer (file manager) and you can go to your My documents folders and you can see your \"Kids\" folder (as an example) but if you write a word document and then go to save it, the \"kids\" folder within your My documents folder cannot be seen.  So what I have to do is save it to my desktop and then move it manually to the kids folder.

That's when I called HP customer service and was told they wouldn't help unless I got the warranty.  Useless!
