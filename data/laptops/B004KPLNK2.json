I remain happy with the price (I got it on a Lightning Deal for $498).  However, the keyboard is still hard to get used to because the backslash key is too close to the left shift and the forward slash key is too close to the Enter key.  Also, the keyboard is quite a bit undersensitive so I have to type more forcefully or else some keystrokes don't register.One problem with this laptop is the battery, which plugs in at a perpendicular angle and elevates the back end of the laptop.  Although this provides a nice tilt toward me and allows for air to flow under and cool the machine, it makes for awkward storage in my briefcase and I have already accidentally dislodged the battery twice when pulling the machine out of my briefcase.  I am concerned that this will lead to undue wear and tear on the battery port in the future.EDIT:  I have had this laptop for 6 months now and remain happy with its performance.  After multiple efforts to address the \"undersensitive keyboard\" problem without resolution, I finally determined that it was due to interference from the touchpad.  Since I was using a bluetooth mouse anyway, I simply disabled the touchpad and the keyboard issue went away.  So, I am upgrading my rating from 3 to 4 stars.  I still do not like the angle of the battery, as it tilts the computer in a way that causes my palms to hit the touchpad, and it also makes the computer a tight fit in my slim computer bag.  However, I have only accidentally pulled the battery off the machine 4-5 times, which is less than I thought I would when I first got the laptop (but still more than I would like).  I remain satisfied with the processor and screen for the price.", "Date": "November 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "gigabyte laptop I like it", "Author": "Omar", "ReviewID": "R2AYHPC1A5RTN0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "good size nice design and the same famous  brands 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 .", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "NO WIFI", "Author": "Gigabyte E1425M-CF1", "ReviewID": "R13EZLQ7G7AAY5", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "all i can say is that im so disappointed at the fact that this computer does not bring wifi. i mean come on man its a laptop. now i have to buy an extra part to use the laptop.", "Date": "October 29, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$699.00", "Features": "14.1-inch 1366x768 LED backlit display/Intel\u00ae HD Graphics with dynamic frequency\nIntel Core i3-380 dual core processor with Intel Hyper-Threading Technology\nWindows 7 Home Premium 32 bit/4GB DDR III RAM/500GB HDD/DVD Supermulti\nUSB 2.0, WiFi support 802.11 bgn/Bluetooth 2.1+EDR/VGA and HDMI output\nSRS Premium Sound solution/1.3MP webcam/8-cell battery pack", "Name": "Gigabyte E1425M-CF1 14.1-inch Essential Notebook (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41r4Aqq9dUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004KPLNK2"}}
