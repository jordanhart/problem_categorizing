This newer model has a slightly faster CPU. These Pentium dual-core processors are one step below the Core i3's. These don't win speed races but they're adequate like a decent 4-cylinder engine in a car.The big 17inch screen is great for movies and the keyboard & trackpad work well.Mine has better sound than most laptops: on DVD's the sound is loud and full range, not tinny like most laptop speakers.", "Date": "November 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 17\" Win7 Laptop", "Author": "Woo H. Paik", "ReviewID": "R1EMHDWW54110J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this laptop.  I bought it for my wife to replace a Win8 laptop that we bought recently.  Win8 is a total mess to say the least.  This one is so good that I bought another one as a backup for myself.  The Intel CPU has 2315 Passmark and it is plenty fast.  The laptop that I am currently using has Intel CPU with 1413 Passmark and is already fast enough.  The Win8 laptop has Intel Core i5 CPU with 3120 Passmark but it is not any faster and just consumes more power, so I think CPU with more than 1000 Passmark is more than fast enough for most applications.The LED backlight LCD is great, the wifi is real fast, and the battery lasts more than 4 hours.  It has HDMI, DVD-supermulti, and great style.  It is the best laptop that I ever had and I highly recommend this.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome Laptop", "Author": "Len", "ReviewID": "R3EOUBU6WFHO1N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this computer !!  After struggling with a new windows 8 computer for a few months I decided to see if I could find a leftover windows 7 model.  this laptop fit the bill and had enough power to fit my needs.  screen resolution is very good and it is quite fast for what I do.  if you have had enough of windows 8 and can find one of these buy it !!!!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best deal for the money! Perfect computer and easy to use!", "Author": "Mark W.", "ReviewID": "RSVG7JJWJ8P5Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had my New Acer 17 inch lap top for two weeks now and use it hard for many hours a day. This is one of the best lap tops I have ever owned and I have had more than 10 in my life. Most have cost over $500 more than this one. This computer is fast and easy to use. The speakers are very good and anyone can hear. One excellent computer. I would highly recommend to anyone look for a new laptop at any price.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just about perfect except for...", "Author": "L. King", "ReviewID": "R1CTLMID7333L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like everything about this laptop except it has one red pixel dropout almost in the center of the monitor--which means I see it a lot--and I have to prop the back up on splints to make it more ergonomic; otherwise, the edge of the computer catches my wrists just so and makes them ache after I've been typing a while. There is also an annoying built-in popup that happens every time I want to view a photo: an advertisement/nag from Microsoft, asking if I want to install Live. Despite having turned it off in programs, it STILL pops up every single time, necessitating a denial and confirmation from me before the viewer will show me the photo. This happened even after I chose to use a different picture viewer! Bad, very bad. Acer needs to vet the programs on their computers before accepting them.If it hadn't been for these few things, I'd have rated the laptop a solid 5 stars.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Happy Has All I Need", "Author": "Great Faulkner's Ghost", "ReviewID": "R3N336CKNLXLK3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you like a big  screen laptop you will love this one. The screen is bright and clear, and computer looks a lot more expensive than it is. It''s about as wide as a laptop can be and still have \"lap\" in the name, but it's quite light, especially for a 17 inch model. It fits easily in my Travelpro carry-on luggage too. The built in speakers sound pretty good too, although I would buy an external set if you plan to do a lot of AV activities. The processor is fast enough for me, as I use it mostly for word processing and surfing the web. I had a Toshiba Core I5 that died, and this as fast or faster to me (it has a faster HD, I believe than my Toshiba). I could do without some of the useless Acer bloatware, but I guess that's par for the course these days. Definitely feel I got a great deal from Amazon.", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this computer", "Author": "Leslie Lawson", "ReviewID": "RT9J2H8WIP31P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is everything I wanted it to be..
