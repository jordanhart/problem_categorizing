{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Only downside is it's weight.", "Author": "Leaianna", "ReviewID": "R3TFIXZQQKSHGJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this laptop a few days ago and I love it. It came exactly as shown/described, with extras (Fingerprint reader anyone?). It also came a day earlier than said earliest arrival date could be, but I'm not sure if that's because I'm in California, or if that's just the way it ended up being.The swivel hinge seems very sturdy, although while in Laptop mode the screen may shake a bit, depending on the surface you put it on (Its more shaky when you have it in your lap versus having it on a desktop). The swivel turns only one way (counter clockwise from Laptop to Tablet, the opposite way Tablet to Laptop), and at the base of the hinge (whether in Tablet or Laptop mode) there is a small window showing which direction to turn it. Once you turn the computer into Tablet mode, you may hear a click, which are the magnetic (for lack of a better word,) connectors that secure the screen from moving around (there is a button on the lid of the laptop to disconnect them.I am a 10th grader, so I use my laptop to take notes and do homework on. Therefore, I tend to prefer Tablet mode. This is the main reason I picked a tablet. The only problem I can find with this laptop, is it's weight. It weighs about 6.5lbs, making it a \"luggable\" computers, but not necessarily \"portable\". If the user (like myself) doesn't mind the weight, it is over all a great computer.There are many features on a tablet that you cannot access on any other computer. Some include; Windows Journal, Ink Art, Ink Desktop, Ink Flashcards, and much much more. This computer does not come with Microsoft Office, so I downloaded Open Office (free). If you as a buyer wish to purchase Microsoft Office, go right ahead, but Open Office is free and can do the same.Overall, I believe this is a great product! I would reccommend it to any and all of my friends looking into a new computer. I have also gotten many positive and no negative comments on the computer form peers at school.UPDATE (3/14/12)We now have two of these computers in our house. My sister, who is in 9th grade got one recently and she is loving it. This computer is great with games, although video card may need to be upgraded sometime to support high quality, newer games. I can play World of Warcraft, and my sister plays Nancy Drew. We can also occasionally play the Sims 3, but with that, occasionally it overloads the video card, so I just have to be sure to save often. Still a great buy, although with my sister's it didn't come with the fingerprint reader or screen cleaner (But, it did come with everything that was shown.) Both of the laptops we bought came with the laptop case, but I suppose the company ran out and is offering something else. We plan to get one (possibly two) more of these laptops, one for my other sister, and possibly one for my mom. Still, a great buy!!", "Date": "February 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "I do love my little machine", "Author": "Kathleen Bernard", "ReviewID": "R36DC981PNKFGG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my little machine.
