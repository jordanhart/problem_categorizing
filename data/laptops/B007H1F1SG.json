Yes, you will find an extra memory slot allowing you to add one additional memory module.  This laptop supports a total of 8GB.  BTW, this computer performs very well with the 4GB memory running Windows 7.  Runs even faster when running Linux.  Our family now has one G570 and two G575's and we are very happy with them.  And yes, if you call Lenovo customer support, you do indeed speak with a live person willing to answer any questions you may have.  I have used IBM/Lenovo products since 2003 and I am very happy.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "good for my computer needs", "Author": "Old John", "ReviewID": "R2R38TTXEGOK0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "lets get to brass tacks here, If your computer needs are for email and personal accounts like bank. utilities. favorite web pages this computer is perfect, I have mine about a year and serves me perfect, If you store much more data on it I will suggest higher memory, For a user like me just storing favorites and keeping nothing else in memory go for this computer,.. remove any bloatware like pictures that come with computers and music comes with computers you will have a good one.

This one does the job and does it well. I really like the features that it offers as far as how easy it is to set up and start using. It is a durable computer and I can take it anywhere. Runs pretty well with multiple applications open. In addition, the sound is good and the video quality is satisfying as well and the camera is actually pretty nice. Previously, I owned a more expensive Lenovo and the only difference between the two are some luxury features like a series of buttons that are easy to find on the computer, like a \"quick-tap\" mute button etc. Perfectly happy with my second Lenovo and will buy another in the future. This laptop is the best for the price of what is out there in the same range.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good laptop", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Daz\"", "ReviewID": "ROE4BVRO90JV1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 11 year old for his birthday.

The customer service is horrible.  They are rude and we have had someone out 3 times and now they want to send it in.  People depend on computers and there is no reason for the rudeness of their customer service.  I have worked on computers.  The technician installs a faulty fan and won't come back and fix it.  NOW we have to send it in.  This is all same problem, 4 times and they will not fix it.
