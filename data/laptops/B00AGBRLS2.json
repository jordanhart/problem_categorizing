I had an older acer and was quite happy with it and for the price of this one could not pass it up. Was worried at first about the windows 8 but playing around with it and discovering how it all works is really fun and easy.  Different for sure but in a good way. Loving the back lit keyboard! Having trouble getting my old office program on it though, still trying to figure that out, it only gives the option to load the Office 2010 and I have an older version that it is not recognizing. There is supposed to be a way to get it on but have not figured that out yet. I love the light weight, sleek design with the larger screen than my others were. Not happy about the battery life. It claims to get 4-5 hrs on the battery but I have not been able to get more than 2. This is disappointing because one of the selling points for me was the longer battery life which it does not have! Other than that overall I am very pleased with this computer, the price is great for what you get. I added more memory to bring it to 8GB and response is really good, fast and touch is instant. Got the last one available before they discontinued it and got a great sale price, $200 cheaper than the upgraded version, so very happy about that. So other than the 2 hr battery life, I am very happy with this laptop and would recommended it.", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "More than enough computer to meet the average users needs!", "Author": "Decorating Fanatic", "ReviewID": "R1POCKXHW6I57X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I\u2019ve owned this laptop since Black Friday 2012. I got it for a really great price from Best Buy. This is a lot of laptop for the money.  I primarily use my laptop for websurfing, photo editing, cd burning, email and Microsoft Word and Excel.  I\u2019ve watched an occasional movie and downloaded a few songs.  I toyed with more expensive models that had a faster \u201cI core\u201d, larger memory but I can say those items were never missed.  It is definitely more than enough laptop for a user like me.  The Acer is very attractive. The battery life hasn\u2019t been an issue for me because I rarely use it when it isn\u2019t plugged in.  The random screen changing thing has been a pain in the neck, although I never really looked into adjusting its sensitivity.  This was my first touchscreen with backlighting and experience with Windows 8 and I find them all indispensable now.  Unfortunately I am in the market for another laptop because my DD stepped on the screen and cracked it.  My only negative experiences with Acer came as a result of this.  I tried several repair shops and aftermarket parts were difficult to find for this model.  They all suggested I contact Acer.  Even though the laptop was under warranty I had a difficult time reaching Tech support.  I knew that things like this were not covered under warranty but I was hoping to purchase a replacement screen so that I could continue to use it. The cost to repair it was nearly the cost of another laptop.  So, I\u2019m on the hunt again.  I don\u2019t think I will buy another Acer. Despite the positive experience with the computer itself, the customer service experience left me feeling like they didn\u2019t really value my business.  So, I\u2019m going to try an HP Pavilion this time.  If customer service is a big issue for you, make another purchase. If not, you will probably be very satisfied with", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a decent tool for the price. (RTM)", "Author": "The Haworth's", "ReviewID": "R2TDJO5QCO5RN0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a good first touchscreen computer with decent battery life.  It's relatively light and easy to tote around.  I wanted to consolidate some tablet capabilities and the convenience of a serious keyboard for travel.  I have found keyboards for tablets too limited and frustrating for serious typing, as in several hours.  This has just enough horsepower to be a good business tool with some entertainment thrown in, and if you shop carefully it is a bargain.  By the way, the reason that so many people are complaining about \"random screens flying open\" is that they are flicking them open accidentally by running a finger across the edges of the touch area.  Reading the manual will alleviate these issues.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "The bad/the good", "Author": "Laurie A. Sheridan \"Lorielle\"", "ReviewID": "R1JTHVAUJUMAMD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The bad is that 1: you will be on one page, and another page, from another app, just flies open on top of it, or knocks you out of what you were doing entirely.  This happens constantly, and I've read the same thing from other reviewers. But does this have something to do with Windows 8, or is it the computer, I don't know.  I read you can do \"command\" plus \"tab\" to get the page back. I am, however, beginning to think, from reading other reviews, that this flipping around of pages is due to your wrists hitting the touchpad.  2: Another big problem for me, which is extremely annoying, but that I'm beginning to think might also be caused by wrists hitting the touchpad, is that the cursor constantly flies to the left, about the length of 8 characters, while I'm typing. And not only does it fly to the left, but when I'm typing into a field, it will fly to another field entirely.  3: The backspace key, which you need to delete with, barely works.  In fact, the Comcast guy, who came to my house, said he'd return the computer for that reason alone.  4:  The computer does not hold the wifi internet connection.  It was constantly bumping me out of the internet to the point where this computer was useless to me.  Comcast told me I needed to buy a new wireless router, which I did.  But I now realize, from reading reviews on other sites, that this is a common problem with this computer; so, the wireless router had nothing whatsoever to do with it.  Strangely, however, I solved this problem, by going into \"settings\" and clicking on my next door neighbor's name. Now I'm always connected to the internet through his connection! Like I said, I know nothing about computers, so don't ask me to explain that (nor could Comcast). 5: The audio, though quite loud compared to my  ASUS, has a kind of lousy tinny sound.  So, though I could not hear my ASUS without using headphones, the ASUS had beautiful sound quality, just the opposite of this, go figure.  Now the good.  1:  Quite fast 2:  backlit keyboard really nice 3: Easy to type on, and I THINK I just solved the problem of the flying cursor, by keeping my wrists elevated.  4: sleek, attractive, light weight design. To end, due to the fast speed of the thing, I would say, yes, I'd recommend this.  I actually do like it.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Touch Laptop at a Non Ripping Price.", "Author": "varma1986", "ReviewID": "R3TUEOTIXHV84D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this particular laptop as a refurbished item from the Acer store on Ebay at a price of <417 US$!!.This can be a good 2nd utility laptop in your home.The cons are:-A 1366*768 low resolution screen wherein words and pictures appear to bleed at the edges.-A good for nothing back-lit keyboard with numeric keyboard where the keys are very small with no indicator for  Caps lock!!.-Cheap plastic make.The Pros are:-A 15.6 inch Intel Touch Screen Windows 8 Laptop.-Cheap price.-Ram is upgradeable to 8GB.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bien...", "Author": "O", "ReviewID": "R32NB9O4D966F3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "La computadora es excelente, la pantalla tactil es lo mejor de todo del resto una laptop que vale la pena comprar...!!", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "DON'T DO IT!", "Author": "Sophia L.

I bought this less than a year ago. 30 days later, hard drive fried, replaced under warranty. 6 months later, SD card port quit working, started eating them, no click to stop or engage. 1 month later (less than 1 yr. old) touchscreen cracked and now I can't even use it. When I called Acer, they said they \"would\" fix the sd card port, but it's physically damaged and that nullifies the warranty. How did it get damaged?
