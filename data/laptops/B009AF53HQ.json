Flimsy, cheap, unreliable, and built with the cheapest components available. Save your money and spend a bit more on something else not built by Toshiba. Best case scenario, you might get 6-12 months out of your laptop before things start to fail. Worse case scenario (as I've just experienced), your laptop will last a matter of weeks before the lights go out. And unfortunately for the buyer, Toshiba often refuses to meet their own warranty obligations. Considering how cheap the laptops are, they don't want to help you, or fix the laptop. They would lose money otherwise. So if you send it in for repairs, like they'll inevitably recommend, you'll find yourself being asked to pay elaborate sums of money because the 'scope of work' is not within the boundaries of the original warranty agreement. This of course is not true. Toshiba is simply trying to force the added costs of warranty repairs down the throats of uninformed customers. Their laptops are cheap, but they won't actually save you any money in the long run.Save your money. Don't buy Toshiba. Consider any laptops made by Toshiba as being purely disposable, or built for third word countries with no consumer protection laws.", "Date": "May 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst laptop I have ever owned.", "Author": "jen", "ReviewID": "R1RTAZG24225CW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "SPEED / PROCESSING It's slow. I can't describe how slow it is. The fan is poorly placed. It runs hotter than most laptops I've used.NOT SO SPECIAL FEATURES The mousepad is a textured grid which is great for collecting salt, sand dust, etc. This is not only a feature that I never wanted but it's a feature that no one wants. The only way I could imagine a poorer design of a mousepad would involve rusty, gangrene inducing razor blade grid.SOUND QUALITY.. WAIT SCRATCH THAT. The speakers are beyond disappointing. My very below average Motorola phone with one speaker has better sound... much better sound.DECISION TIME I like to believe that events that happen in life happen for a reason. I don't like to live with regret. I don't want to go in a time machine and change high school or make a different major life decision. Though, if I could have that time machine and use it just once I might just go back in time to the moment 5 minutes before I clicked purchase on this laptop and walk outside with the stack of cash I used to purchase this computer and start a fire in the fire pit b/c hey, who doesn't love a nice relaxing $400 fire.", "Date": "May 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$429.99", "Features": "Intel Pentium Processor B980\n4GB DDR3 1333MHz memory\n5400rmp Serial ATA 500GB HDD, +/-R double layer DVD-SuperMulti drive\nHD TruBrite LED Backlit display, 1366x768 (HD), 16:9 aspect ratio, Supports 720p content\nWebcam, Wi-Fi Wireless networking (802.11b/g/n)", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite C855-S5349 15.6\" Notebook (2.40 GHz Pentium B980 Processor, 4 GB RAM, 500 GB Hard Drive, Windows 8)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QwOZpEbRL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B009AF53HQ"}}
