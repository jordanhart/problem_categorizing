I use it as a bathroom laptop to read news while I'm in there because trying to do anything else is a pain in the ass. The keyboard is a nightmare and you practically have to punch the keys to get them to register and the space bar oh god dont get me started on how annoying it is to have to constantly smash the damn thing to get it to work at all.This thing sucks all because but the keyboard is worthless and youre better off plugging a mouse into it and using windows onscreen keyboard and clicking 1 letter at a time to type anything.", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Owned for 9 months", "Author": "zach", "ReviewID": "R1KLM879ZX2R6R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Only problem is the space bar. I've wrote pages and pages on this thing but deal with the missed space every other paragraph. No problems with the screen other than me dropping it and cracking it. Nice thing with a cheap laptop is the replacements are cheap.It was only $70 to replace the screen which i did myself. Plenty of memory left with a few hundred songs along with hundreds of pictures. With online storage offered by every website just about makes hard drives obsolete unless you travel or don't have internet where you use the laptop. Think about it imgur, facebook, google docs, all of theses websites we already upload most of our things too. I've got a Macbook, guess what when the warranty went out, my computer started not charging the battery. So i bought a new battery, that didnt fix it, got it tested by Macbook approved shop, said i needed a new motherboard, $1100. Guess what its in the other room hooked up to the charger/plug, cant use on the couch unless plugged in, which is a joke, one tap and documents or test gone.... Bought this little Asus x401a just for the livingroom. If this motoherboard messes up, it will only cost $ 100-130. Love this laptop.I recommend it to all ages.

The Asus X401A was purchased in BestBuy as a brand new laptop. And it broke down after a bloody 3-month period! Now I have to completely throw it away since I cannot even enter the safe mode (not to mention that all of my files are lost)!!!Update:I decided to try my luck and pulled the HDD out for a backup and sent the laptop back to ASUS. It's still within the 12-month under the warranty so I decided to give it a try. And they fixed it - actually I think they replaced my motherboard and wiped my entire HDD out. Now I am having almost a brand new laptop and although re-installing all of the softwares took me a day or so it's worth the hassles.Bottom line: if you have to carry your laptop around all the time, I do NOT recommend this model for you: this little thing is really fragile (it's very thin indeed) and you may just accidentally shake it here and there and before long you will see problems showing up. However, if you just place it on your desk and put a lock on it so you won't be able to move it around, this is a perfect choice for its price. I originally gave a rating of 1 star, but now I raised it to 3 stars, since ASUS did not charge me for fixing it (other than letting me to pay the shipping cost from my place to the repair center in California)", "Date": "February 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "People are crazy", "Author": "Clopez94", "ReviewID": "R7POU415FIUWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The guys below or above are crazy, because I have this computer and work awesome. Of course your son's space bar is not gonna work, this is not a gaming computer that is why his space bar is messed up of pressing it too much to jump or to shoot. But overall this computers bring all the features you need to do work, or videos. It offers HDMI many computers do not offer that. Also it offers a cam and that is very helpful for when I have business meetings. In my opinion the only down side of the computer is that it does not have a CD/DVD Drive. I recommend this computer to people that need a computer to do School work or business work. I do not recommend this computer to parents that wants to buy computer for kids because they might use it to play video games and this computer is not gonna work for that.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "Henry", "ReviewID": "R2R1LTLHVMBBYO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I usually don't write reviews but I feel I have to on this one. I would give this thing 0 Stars if I could. I bought this trash two months ago from Best Buy with the intention of using it to type papers and browse the web.Pros  - Good Screen Size and Quality  - Thin for a cheap computerCons  - Gets dirty easily  - Space bar will only work half the time  - Track pad can be very unresponsive  - Wireless Connectivity is awfulAfter two months of using this thing, I got the blue screen of death and I sent it into the shop to get it fixed under warranty. I am going to practically give this to someone on eBay just to get it off my hands and I'm buying a Mac because I know I can trust those.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009RUNY8Y"}}
