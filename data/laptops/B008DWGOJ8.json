{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent laptop with 1 caveat . .", "Author": "Nuroppo", "ReviewID": "R3584SXSL1JL9H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned this laptop for roughly a year having given it quite a bit of use on a few occasions.  It handles everything I need it to do from Office, to internet surfing, to video chatting, to gaming.  The display is quite nice being full HD and is very well lit.  The keyboard is a keyboard.  it is backlit; however, I have not used that function yet.  My only 'beef' is with the touchpad on this thing.  Normally I use an external mouse so I don't have any issues; however, recently I have misplaced my mouse and have been forced to use the touchpad to control the pointer.  It is horrible.  Any light touch will register.  I have accidentally highlighted files/folders and moved them to locations I don't know.  It is also a pain when trying to process photos.  When I try to press with a little more force to make sure I don't accidentally highlight and move things I end up clicking/selecting something with the mouse or moving it off of the area I was trying to type in.  An external mouse will eliminate all of these problems, and turning off the touchpad is as simple as 2 keys on the keyboard.  Everything else about this laptop is phenominal though.  The HD is split (on partition for the OS and one for regular storage).  The BD reader is nice to have too for movies.  The tiny external speaker that comes with it is kind of useless.  Hardware wise the specs will be able to handle whatever your needs are.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Defective mouse pad and mouse pad disabler", "Author": "craigmyr", "ReviewID": "R3MLPPRIYUYW4L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This laptop arrived with a quirky mousepad.  It seemed to click on its own making it almost impossible to type without the cursor jumping around.  I used the fn9 for a few days and then it stopped working.  My nice new computer is now on its way to California for repairs.  Possibly the most disturbing thing is that, after spending so much money on a laptop, when I called ASUS tech services, they suggested that I let them tell me how to permenantly disable the mousepad.  I would think they had enough pride in their products to want to make a new computer work correctly rather than cut off the broken stuff.  So far, I'm not real impressed with ASUS.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008DWGOJ8"}}
