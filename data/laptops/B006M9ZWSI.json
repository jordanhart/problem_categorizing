I picked one up since my X61 was getting temperamental.I figured for $249, how bad could it be?  Well...with Windows 7 (and I'm a Mac guy as a rule) the computer is just fine for general use.  Quick enough loading web pages, and, unlike the usual assortment of crapware that most computers come pre-loaded with?  Office Starter (Word and Exel) for free!I'm just a happy little guy-I would have easily spent more on a used computer, not had the most current OS, not had the upgradability (I bet when I move this to 8GB of ram it will fly!) and really, for my purposes I think this was a great buy! Highly recommend..", "Date": "April 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great basic Laptop!", "Author": "TomDaBomb", "ReviewID": "R15V1O1X0X2OAB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm like the other two reviewers, I got this at Frys for $249. For the money, I'm surprised at how fast it is. It's super light and the screen is crisp & clear. I didn't want to spend alot of money on a laptop, because as fast as technology goes this will be outdated within a couple months. But it's perfect for me for light use and I would highly recommend it!", "Date": "April 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice basic system", "Author": "C. Smth", "ReviewID": "RRPGJKR87XC64", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Was waiting for a price drop on this unit on Amazon but finally saw it at Fry's for $249. I just need a basic simple Laptop for surfing web, MS Word and email and this works great for what I need to do. I dont expect amazing performance at this price, but it works better than I expected. Nice sized screen, easy touch keyboard, super quite fan ( I never hear it kick on and off like my old one), runs amazingly cool even when sitting on a bed or couch, fast when im online. I even ran some CAD/CAM programs that ran almost as well as my work system, the graphics card seems to handle 3D CAD/CAM fine as well as Photoshop, although the monitor might not be up to displaying super fine photo-editing qualities... it's a nice screen, just not near as good as higher end units. Build quality is good, but nothing fancy. Not a designer Laptop, just a good all around basic unit that exactly fits my needs. Im very happy with this computer.Update: I installed an extra 4 MB of memory, for a total of 6 MB, noticed no real performance increase at all. Glad it was only $20, but install went smooth, no issues installing additional Crucible brand memory", "Date": "April 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "My Wife Loves Her New Laptop!", "Author": "John Capel", "ReviewID": "R3DIYJN62FREGL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop arrived well-packaged within a couple of days of ordering.  My wife was tired of her old laptop and asked me to get her a replacement.  I decided on the Lenovo brand based on my prior experiences with IBM/Lenovo.  I purchased a Lenovo G570 last year and was very pleased with it.  The Lenovo G575 uses an AMD Dual-Core processor and runs much faster than her old laptop.  This item does come standard with a 1-year hardware warranty.  I would highly recommend this item to friends and family.", "Date": "June 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "My first laptop! Rated best brand", "Author": "Julie S", "ReviewID": "R3E0B2RWD607TP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this computer for general use. I talked to one of my friends who works on technology and he suggested the Lenevo brand because as of right now Lenevo is rated in the top 3 laptop brands. I love it! it's light, the speakers are loud, and it is good quality. the backspace and number pad are a little smaller than normal but then again most laptops don't have a number pad. And sometimes the mouse turns into automatic mode..that might be able to be adjusted just haven't taken the time to see if it can or not...It is my first laptop...but have used many other people's and for the price it is great. i did pay $419 on amazon so was a little upset when i saw it was cheaper but oh well. hope this helped", "Date": "May 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Neat product for the price", "Author": "Kalani Ruwanpathirana", "ReviewID": "R36F0WPOAD3S00", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop for the price.

It came with windows 7 installed and out of the box it was easy and quick to set up. It found our home network during setup and connected (once I gave it the key #) easily. No problems from this basic machine yet. Fast, quick startup and decent enough screen. There are quite a few $400 computers out there...this one is worth it.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my Lenovo", "Author": "Marilyn N \"Marilyn N.\"", "ReviewID": "R19C689538726G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm really a novice at purchasing items like this but I knew I'd want to keep in touch electronically on vacation. I found this item on Amazon and I had heard that some of our local library techs used this brand so I took a chance. It was easy to use and I was easily able to pick up WiFi at the hotel. The software already downloaded was user friendly so that even a newbie could figure it out. It wasn't that expensive and I have been very pleased with this product.", "Date": "June 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "does it all", "Author": "Lyn Stevens \"Amazon fan\"", "ReviewID": "R3URS9E621L3U5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Lenovo does what I need it to do.

Mayer \"Just a customer\"", "ReviewID": "R10B3R64OMQIGN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The G575 works great except they don't put any locktite on the two hidden screws that hold the hinges on.  As a result the screws fall out after about 8 months use and where the hinges screw into the base snaps.  Every time you open the lid the case opens up along the seam in the back.  You have to go the the fine print in the back of the warranty to find out that hinges and the key board are not covered after 90 days. The rest of the warranty in bold print says basically everything mechanical is covered.  Besides, fan, hinges, keys, battery holder, and plugs what else is mechanical no a laptop.  Bottom line this is a problem they could have prevented by using locktite on the screws like every other manufacture.  No you can't get it fixed for less than the cost of the machine because the damage causes other problems.  No more Lenovo for me.  Customer service is a  joke.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006M9ZWSI"}}
