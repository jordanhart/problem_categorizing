Zhou", "ReviewID": "R1D31GG2NZHXKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A little about myself:I am a college senior and a very techie geek. I've went through ALOT of laptops and other electronics. I've used this guy for about a week now. It's been a very positive experience.PROS:1. Battery life. I took this guy to my 8 hour workplace, and after the entire day of light use, it STILL had around 40% left. The previous MacBooks usually would be around 5%.2. Screen. Absolutely stunning. Less glare, more pixels. The stuff on the screen looks painted on. You may have experience the Retina display on an iPhone, but it's a different experience on a bigger screen.3. Speed. i5 + SSD is no joke. It'll zip through everyday tasks like a champ.4. Build quality. One of the best built laptops ever made, and I expect no less from Apple. I prefer this retina's build quality over the older macbook pros and airs because it doesn't make ANY sound. The other older models seems to have a slight creak, this one doesn't. They also made it slimmer and lighter than the 2012 retina. Also love the thinner bezels.5. GPU. The integrated Iris 5100 graphics card is surprisingly powerful. It has a whole 1GB of VRAM. Still can't run the latest games with respectable FPS and texture settings, but it can handle more than an integrated graphics card should.6. Trackpad. This is the #1 reason I prefer any Macbook made after 2009 over Windows laptops. The trackpad is just absolutely amazing. Even after all these years, I have not had one Windows laptop that can match the Mac's trackpad.CONS:1. Speakers. I wish Apple would improve the speakers on the 13\" MacBooks, but then it might get even more expensive. Speakers just don't sound nice at all, but then again it is a very thin 13\" laptop.2. I feel like they should've added more USB ports instead of having 2 Thunderbolt ports.CONCLUSION:With the price drop, it's much more competitive. The price was the reason I didn't get the 2012 models, simply way overpriced. The new prices made me bite.  If you are looking for a secondary computer to your main desktop, BUY THIS ONE. I prefer this macbook retina over the Air any day. With only a couple hundred more, you get a better screen, faster processor, better GPU, and better build quality (Thinner bezels). The Air does have more battery life but who really needs 13 hours of battery life?I decided to sell mine because this is my ONLY computer. In the end, I overestimated how much I could store in the 128gb SSD. In this day and age, 128gb SSD is just too small if you're planning on using it as your main machine. So like I said, buy this if it's your SECONDARY machine. If it's your primary machine I would say go with a bigger hard drive.All in all, I loved my time with it, but had to let it go because of the limited storage. I ended up getting an older model Macbook Pro with the traditional HDD, and immediately I disliked the screen that I once loved. Once you go Retina you do not go back! The best laptop I've ever had the pleasure of using.EDIT:Another con I found for Macs in general: External mouse in Mac OS feels weird. I'm used to gaming on Windows, and gaming on Mac just feels terrible, mostly because Macs uses a higher mouse acceleration setting...Probably the same reason why the trackpad feels so nice. Installing Windows in bootcamp is a must for gamers.", "Date": "November 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fell in love all over again", "Author": "MARCIA", "ReviewID": "R1ODSTHC09B3W9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a replacement for my 5 and a half year old White Macbook. Originally, I bought the iPad Air w/retina display without researching it much, trusting in my past experiences with Apple products. That was a mistake on my part. While the iPad Air is a fine tablet for some people, it is NOT a laptop replacement. Sent it back. Thank you Amazon!Went to the Apple Store and did proper research this time. Looked at the 11\" Macbook Air: Very thin and light. Didn't feel very substantial and my gargantuan hands felt a bit cramped while typing. Onto the 13' Macbook Air: Slightly thicker. Felt more solid than the 11\". Hands no longer cramped. Price was $1099. I noticed the 13\" Macbook Pro w/retina display was $1299. For 200 more you get a significantly faster, more substantial computer than the  Macbook Air, and retina display. I took the plunge!As is usual with Apple products, the MBP 13  w/retina display worked right out of the box.  The design of the unibody aluminum shell is absolutely gorgeous. Press the ON button and a startup program guides you effortlessly through setting up your Mac. The retina display is stunning and bright. HD video is gorgeous. Speed is impressive as is battery life, especially if you set the display to three quarters brightness and tweak A few of the energy saver settings. Surfing the web, watching YouTube videos, and checking e-mail with the display set at three quarters brightness, I can get up to 10 hours on a charge.The keyboard and trackpad are an absolute delight to use. Typing is effortless and the trackpad has a really smooth feel and it's very easy to use. Well the MacBook Pro 13 isn't this thin or as light as a MacBook air, it is still quite thin and at 3.5 pounds it's significantly lighter than my old MacBook . It's also very fast and handles multitasking with ease. If a tablet is not quite enough for your computing needs, but you don't need a powerhouse laptop either, this lowest end model of the 13 inch MacBook Pro with retina display should suit you perfectly. Apple service is superb and although their laptops are significantly more expensive than the competition, they are worth it. Since they end up lasting a lot longer than other brands, Apple products are a superior value in the long run. I highly recommend this model.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Oh man, oh man is this ever an awesome piece of equipment.", "Author": "Mr. Bigg", "ReviewID": "R17YUY5NRM6DKE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A quick note about myself...I am an engineer, and I have a lot of appreciation for product design, including haptic, ease of use, and aesthetics. I was on the line for a long time, always yearning for a macbook from apple. Always sitting in coffee shops, dreaming of typing on my own. Well, I got this on Black Friday for $1099, so it was a no brainer.This is a very fast laptop, of course with the SSD. They also have finally added USB 3.0, and a full sized HMDI connector. These two features make this even more worthwhile. Typing and using the trackpad is in my experience second to none. I love the long battery life, which I don't think can be compared to by a windows machine with these specs. What I LOVE the most however, is the retina screen. It is even way better than I expected. Just try it.I use this laptop for surfing, and editing photos, and it works great for that. A 128 gb SSD is really too small, but I plan to replace the original with a 512 in a year or so, when the prices come down. Then I will have no complaint at all.All in all, a beautiful machine, and I am glad I waited for this one. It blows the normal macbook pros and airs out of the water for my needs.

Thick enough, light enough.System: Although with this budget, you can buy a PC with higher system, but Macbook pro will bring back smoothy and fluently in running programs. No lagging, no \"Not response\" as you saw in PC. Beside that, PCIe-based flash storage take out all the noise. The speed of copy or starting were enhanced very much.

This laptop is by far the best piece of hardware I have ever purchased.  I could not be happier (granted it has only been a few days).Pros:- Build quality is unrivaled.- OSX:  I am a CIO and have used many different brands of hardware and operating systems throughout my career and I was always hesitant to move to Mac since I've mostly lived in a Windows world.  My fears have been erased.  OSX gives you plenty of options for customization and gives you powerful command line and automation tools if the geek in you needs the outlet- Specs:  Price was not a problem when put up against other \"ultra books\" with similar specs.  Also, at this point in time the Iris graphics and PCIe hard drive are ahead of the game even when compared against more expensive models such as the Samsung Ativ ultra book.- Battery life:  With the screen brightness down just a touch and just basic life, I'm seeing almost 12 hours of battery life.  Enough said.- Integration with other iDevices:  Airplay and Airdrop are nice touches when you own an Apple TV and iPhone.Cons:- Lack of touch screen:  A touchscreen isn't necessary for OSX, nor would it even be optimal.  However, in the touch screen world we live in, this could be seen as a negative.  Definitely not a deal breaker by any means because the touchpad is amazing!- Lack of ethernet port:  There are times when wireless doesn't cut it.  I realize there is a thunderbolt to ethernet adapter, just haven't taken the plunge yet.Bottom line:  Buy it.  Now.  You will not regret it.  There is not laptop on the market that even comes close to the quality and specs of this machines.  It just feels natural.  Also, once you get used to OSX, you quickly realize that there is no reason to fear the switch.  You get a special bonus if you already have an Apple TV and iPhone.

Alexander", "ReviewID": "R2NS23OBHEOT2E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This review has been a long time coming. I've had a succession of premium Windows laptops dating back to Windows 95. The most recent was an HP Spectre 13t Ultrabook with Windows 8.1. I had it for a week alongside this MacBook. I no longer have it. I do not expect to purchase another Windows machine in the indefinite future.EDIT: I've added some notes on multi-monitor usage below.I bought this system to edit in Photoshop on the road. My version is 2.4 | 16 GB | 256 GB. Screen quality, size, weight, and build were high priorities. After four months with this system, I believe it is the best mobile laptop available, second only to the Air for folks who don't need the Retina screen or 16GB of RAM.MAC VS. WINDOWS:It's hard to evaluate the Mac in isolation, so I'll make a few comparisons to the HP and Windows 8 in general. The Spectre is not the best Windows system available, but a good one similar in focus and class to the rMBP.* Build. Very stiff, very sleek, and as thin as anything with this solidity. Aesthetically perfect to me. Light (3.5 lbs) unless you're comparing it to recent 2-2.5lb machines. It could be thinner. The narrow bezel could be even more minimalist. That's about it for improvements. The keyboard has good travel and pleasing backlighting. I don't miss keystrokes.It's not a tank though. I distinguish between build quality (impeccable) and durability (lackluster). The aluminum case scratches and dents easily, especially the sharp edges. I have mine vinyl-wrapped. If you drop it, you may have to replace the entire case. I've seen one person physically bend a MacBook by wedging it offset into their luggage. No system in this size class would do any better, but I do miss the overbuilt chassis and easy parts replacement of my older Latitude. I'm more keenly aware of dangers to this MacBook.* Screen. Better than anything not in an HP or Dell Precision-class laptop. 1600p, 16:10 aspect, full sRGB gamut, IPS, fairly high brightness, very low dE after after calibration, and low glare. The Spectre had a 16:9, 1440p screen with more glare, less brightness, a slight tint, and somewhat lower gamut. For serious color work, this MacBook is the class of the field.But that's just the spec. The real advantage is how OS X deals with scaling. Windows HiDPI support is inconsistent outside of the 'Modern' interface. It has somewhat better font rendering relative to the Mac at non-optimal scaling settings, but problems all over the place with UI elements. Some large, some small, most blurry. On the Mac, unoptimized apps just have blocky text. The UI doesn't get smaller. It's so easy for programmers to optimize for Retina that all of my apps have updates available.Font scaling at non-optimal settings is ever-so-slightly less clear, but I barely notice. The people lamenting that the stock interface approximates a 1280x800 machine do not, to me, have a valid complaint.This scaling advantage is huge. It's one of the biggest reasons I moved over. I wanted a high-res screen, and Windows 8.1 (and the rest of the Windows app community) just isn't ready. Many Adobe apps are difficult to use at 1440p on a 13\" screen and have yet to be updated.* OS. Another huge element for three reasons: gestures, multiple desktops, and search and organization.Gestures (particularly with third-party additions like BetterTouchTool) are miles ahead of Windows. They just work and the variety is tremendous. I rapidly got used to sliding between desktops and shuffling windows around. I almost never click the touchpad unless I'm dragging a slider in Photoshop. Instead, I tap and swipe at warp speed. There is no Windows machine from anyone in this ballpark. Windows doesn't do multiple desktops (in the 'classic' interface) natively.That advantage doesn't matter at home when I've got three large screens and an external mouse and keyboard. But on the road without any of the attachments, and without an external mouse, I'm probably twice as productive on the Mac. Maybe more. I spend far less time with window management. Little things also enable this, like an Alt-Tab function that automatically cycles between two in-use windows, and two-finger scroll that doesn't require a window to be selected.The other big change is that I spend less time organizing files. On Windows, I spend a lot of time creating folders within subfolders, keeping the hierarchy in my head. Inevitably I fall behind and clutter the Desktop. I spend this time because Windows Search has been terrible since XP. It's never indexed properly for me, so I miss files; it's not universal, in the sense that what you find in a Start Menu search is not what comes up in a Windows Explorer search; and it has a palpable delay before the results appear.Spotlight has none of these problems. It's so instant that pulling it up with CMD-Space, navigating to a result, and opening it are all part of the same stream of keystrokes. It indexes the entire drive on every log-in. You miss nothing. It's so fast and comprehensive to find documents and change apps that I've turned off the dock entirely. I could duplicate some of this functionality with Everything Search on Windows, but it doesn't integrate as well as Spotlight. This is a definite Mac win.Also of note: instant resume and multi-user support. No waiting for standby or resume. No sensitivity to when you close the lid. And when you want to change accounts, the switch is immediate after entering a password. No logging out, no loading screens.* Apps. There's a whole lot of cruft on the Windows side. Not long ago, I was looking for one that would record a video feed from a USB device. Four apps and two wasted hours later, I hadn't gotten anywhere. That functionality is built into OS X. In general, there's less available for OS X, but what is available tends to look and perform better than what's on the Windows side. Gamers may take exception.* Battery. If I'm just looking at webpages in Safari (Chrome uses more energy) and they're not all flash video, I see 10-13 hours of battery life consistently with middle screen brightness. If I'm cranking away in Photoshop on max bright and Bridge is generating thumbnails in the background, that drops to 4-5 hours.* Quirks. I don't like the startup sound (you can't permanently disable it, though it'll track the system volume level). I don't like that new windows tend to spawn on top of existing ones rather than in a new desktop. Many animations (e.g., desktop switching, fullscreen) are impossible to disable without third-party software. For my power-user workflow, I rely on at least three apps to improve the experience: BetterTouchTool (gestures), BetterSnapTool (window management), and TotalSpaces (disabling animations better multi-monitor consistency). Some Apple apps prioritize form over function (e.g., Time Machine). A few of the inbuilt office-style apps (e.g., Mail) seem like relics from the mid-2000s.That's about it.On the hardware side, every Windows machine seems to have some random thing wrong with it. The HP had high-pitched and frequent fan noise, excessive CPU throttling, and wouldn't let me turn off all the keyboard lights. Other systems have weak keyboards. Still others have no battery life. All of them have, at best, workmanlike touchpads (thanks to Windows and half-baked drivers).The point of this isn't to rant about Windows, I still use it on every other system I have. But in a mobile machine, it's harder, sometimes impossible, to work around the areas where it falls short.So what do I miss about Windows?The Windows 8 task and resource managers are more intuitive and convey more information at a glance. In general, I think the Windows system tools are superior.The Windows 8.1 'modern' interface (the side you'd see on a Windows phone or a tablet) is superb in a touch environment, and I'd love to have a MacBook/iPad amalgam with similar functionality once the hardware is thin and light enough to make that feasible. (As it is, I don't miss touch at all on this MacBook; touchpad gestures are faster and more capable.)Office on Windows is a better program. I don't care for the Mac equivalent. The Windows version is sluggish, but acceptable for most uses in Parallels.Windows runs faster on similar hardware. Animated transitions and scrolling on the rMBP can lag and stutter sometimes with content-heavy pages and programs.Windows doesn't have a title bar on top. I like my apps to maximize to the top of the screen. Minor point.That's it. Windows still feels like an old shoe to me, so there's comfort in the familiarity, but really: I don't miss it.MULTI-DISPLAY SETUPS:I recently begun to pair my Mac with two 27\" 2560x1440 displays. Both are Asus IPS, which cost about half as much as Apple's equivalent. They use DisplayPort; coupled with a cheap adapter, they plug directly into the two Thunderbolt ports.My initial plan was to use a docking station and a single Thunderbolt port for both, but this is not possible except with an Apple display and a second Apple display daisy-chained to it. Third-party displays each require their own port; no Thunderbolt docking station supports more than one third-party screen at one time.Connected directly, the internal Iris chip drives both screens *and* the MacBook's own display. Each can have multiple desktops. The animations get a little choppier, but this is still impressive. It's over 11MP of screen. Scaling is perfect and each screen has its own background and color profile. Settings and app locations are, for the most part, maintained between sessions.The only caveat is that I see inconsistent performance with my Windows 8.1 VM in Parallels. I wanted to run Visio 2013, but ultimately had to revert back to a Windows XP VM with Visio 2010. That one blazes; the 2013 version was occasionally unusable if I was running a lot of other programs. Quad-core MacBooks with a dedicated nVidia graphics chip will fare better.MAC VS. MAC:* rMBP 13 vs. Air:Easy choice. The rMBP has a better screen and supports 16GB of RAM. If you don't need either, buy the Air.For those advantages, you end up with a thicker chassis that's a half-pound heavier (3 lbs vs 3.5 lbs). You can edit photos and video with the Air, but the gamut isn't wide enough for professional work, and comparatively poor viewing angles make it harder to show your work to others. Speed is otherwise similar, even favoring the Air because it has fewer pixels to push. Still, at any scaling setting, text and graphics look considerably better on the Retina screen.If you need 16 GB, you know it already. Mavericks does impressive RAM compression, so 8 GB here is more like 11-12 GB on the Windows side. Be aware that while the internal SSD is fast (700 MB/s), it's still miles slower than the RAM, and the system will tank if it has to page the swap file.* rMBP 13 vs. MBP 13:Choose the MBP 13 if you want to add cheap 3rd-party RAM and SSD storage. You lose the Retina screen, the thin chassis, and the stellar Haswell idle battery life. If you don't need expandable storage or the Retina screen (or if you're planning to configure the MBP solely from the Apple page), there's almost no reason to prefer it to the Air. And if you're not budget-constrained, there's no reason at all to choose it over the rMBP.* rMBP 13 vs. rMBP 15:If you're editing video or doing a lot of time-sensitive processing, choose the 15. It has a quad-core chip that's 50-100% faster than the 13. Same 16 GB RAM cap, and it's a significantly larger and heavier chassis.The 15 is also smoother in OS X by some margin. It doesn't really gain in multitasking; you can slot windows side-by-side easily with the 13 and multiple desktops make up for the ones you can't.The 15 is really about speed in processor-limited workflows. With 22MP raw files, ACR adjustments on my 13 are adequately fast. Conversions are a little sluggish, as are some Photoshop functions like Content-aware Fill. I don't object, but it's not lickity-split quick like my home quad-core Windows machine and, to a lesser extent, the rMBP 15.* Fast CPU vs. Slow CPU:Slow. The major divide is dual-core vs. quad-core (i.e., rMBP 13 vs. 15). The fastest dual-core is maybe 20% quicker than the slowest. Likewise for the quad chips, but the gulf between dual and quad will be more like 75% for some workloads. Better a slow quad than a fast dual, particularly as Intel's Turbo function makes the quads nearly as good for 1-2 core workloads.* More SSD vs. Less SSD:More. 256 GB, 512 GB if possible.Macs don't (appear to) use a shared DLL folder like Windows machines, so every program packages all of its files with it. This makes uninstalls dead-simple and eradicates file-version conflicts, but also increases the size of every program. A 10 MB Windows program may well be 40 MB on the Mac. I rely a lot on cloud storage, so I haven't felt limited by my 256 GB drive.SD cards and flash drives can provide more space for content that doesn't need to be immediately accessible. But be aware: only SanDisk Extreme USB 3.0 flash drives (and no SD cards) use a proper SSD-style storage controller. Other USB drives may be speedy for sequential transfers, but will tank on small files and random writes.I would not choose the 128 GB drive unless you're only using the system as an internet and writing terminal. Any large files will rapidly exhaust your free space. Same comment about 4GB of RAM with more sophisticated programs. You can't expand the RAM or (easily) expand the SSD on these Retina-class Macs.IN SUM:I'd rather not have spent as much as I did on this system. It was $500 more than the HP for similar specifications and another 8GB of RAM. But having used it for two months, I don't regret the extra money at all. It is a fully-baked product that doesn't exist on the Windows side.

That program supposedly deletes it, but it appears again every 3 weeks or so. Given I don't go to any website every three weeks, my only option would be to learn computer code to make my own internet firewall (there were seriously forums that told average PC users how to do that) or call a tech support guy to do it for me for $150, or get a better security system for $100 every year. I decided to delete the program every 3 weeks using the uninstall you get from the website while I thought about upgrading to a mac (The malware is so aggressive it disables your computers ability to uninstall it without help from the website's owners--oh and when it was on my computer it literally blocks the two websites I use most-google and gmail!) Here is my Facebook post about it from January-My last malware problem kind of took forever to resolve, and I want to share this link in case anyone accidentally downloads anything from AVG. It pretends to be a secure computer virus protection company but it improperly installs programs so you cannot remove them. Despite having a few pages recommending faulty ways to remove the software on its site, it is basically impossible to remove unless you get a paid technician or paid virus removal, but somehow it also decided to release its removal tool on this page that removes all AVG software from your computer because the individual program won't come off! (And it also blocks access to google and gmail!). Stay away from AVG if it ever comes up on a webpage!So that was one of the biggest things that made me less PC friendly. I also had another issue with super-nice PCs, they seem to have really bad hardware. I had to go through a standardized testing website for a teaching test, and that website on google chrome literally would not run properly. I sat in exasperation for 1 hour trying both explorer and chrome while my webpage blinked, froze, and jumped all over the place, something that never happened before on any website I needed to go to. For whatever reason, after pulling up safari on my iPhone I got through the payment and registration without a single glitch!Finally, the computer I got new from sony also showed messed up YouTube videos frequently straight out of the box. When watching video I could put up with low sound from the built in speakers, but I could not stand how the computers aren't reliable with regards to playing about 20% of popular music videos. One would need to let a basic youtube video sit for 20 minutes on no volume with the clouds of dark colored static before it could work out a video after a few plays! So it seems all PCs, even VAIO laptops that are brand new, don't process visual data in a reliable way like a Mac can.Although I used to really like Sony laptops, I think the malware cost and time issue coupled with a better internet system and much fewer PC related program closes is enough reason to get a Mac. But a few other things I love about Macs are:-The screen is life changing! I can't believe screen technology is so advanced on a Mac compared to even a mid-range priced sony which is known for graphics. I love the beautiful, crisp, clean colors, and every time I look at my mac it's like looking at a new piece of technology just for the screen. A professional graphic designer I know has told me that there is no known printer that can print a photograph that will show the range of colors and quality of a picture you can see on a retina mac book pro--it's simply the best graphics out there. For someone like me who loves colors and visual organization, the Mac book is worth the extra money for that.-I think the design of the laptop is stunning. It is so extremely sleek and thin for such a machine. I really think the 13.3 inch screen doesn't look small at all compared to a 15 inch sony because it just looks so nice!-The programs are way better. More privacy, more security, and higher functioning software, plus an added bonus of being able to sync my phone, iPhone, and other technology together. The only thing I think could be better is it could come with more fonts on Pages.My main concern with getting a 13.3 inch Mac would be that it would look like a tiny computer and would just be too awkward to use as someone who used PCs for a while. I think the computer really looks great, at the moment the price can't be beat given the computer's durability, and I am gearing up to get through a mini manual to start learning my first mac tricks. I also feel that as a young graduate student I actually feel left out if I am not educating myself about the basically best forms of technology and want to become as mac advanced as possible as soon as possible. I do have a small complaint despite my appreciation for my Mac. As a new user, I have come across many web forums that include small paragraphs of not just frustrated users but people mad enough to say ridiculous things like they want to throw their mac out a window over small issues that are impossible to figure out. At this point in time almost all of those issues can be fixed easily with a good 15 minute google session. However, in barely earlier years people who seemed really smart and technologically qualified really were quite annoyed with some of the complications of a mac system. Some of those complications are still a little annoying, and I feel apple needs to release an official guide to its products and not leave users to figure out things by googling and using guides that often aren't complete. I recently was trying to figure out a way to maximize internet windows. Unfortunately my guide didn't include the quick command listed in its appendixes, a way to find it in the glossary, and even my laminated two page guide I got from amazon didn't include it either. During a frustrating, tiring day you kind of wish you didn't have to read through 20 ways to maximize a window using complicated coding forums that include people's freakout stories about these issues and other people's reactions to those issues and frustrations before getting to the simple keyboard command after 10 minutes of looking through google (sad but true).  I think given the overall benefits of a mac system this isn't a big deal at all, but then again I think apple's unwillingness to publish a substantial guide to its products basically is the reason why windows is still even a competitor for apple and people still are attached to PCs. If people felt confident their computer wouldn't have simple commands that would be time-consuming to figure out and very inconvenient to understand, then I think apple would be able to sell many more Macs. Although I got through most of my questions, I am now trying to understand why my superdrive isn't installing a CD, which may require a couple more downloads before superdrive works. The superdrive pamphlet that comes with Superdrive doesn't even say if there is or is not an installation process....yay. As someone who considers myself to be extremely hardworking and understands how active, lazy, and emotionally sensitive the average person really is, I completely understand why people wouldn't want to get a Mac despite that it is so much better than a PC, haha.

I bought a Compaq Presario CQ62 laptop for $600 or so in 2010 that I've used regularly up to now. Not a horrible laptop, but as my budget was limited, I couldn't invest in anti-virus software, which likely led to a slower performance in recent years. The battery barely lasted longer than two hours, and after using it nonstop for one hour, it became VERY slow and near-unresponsive, highly frustrating if I was in the middle of writing a paper.This, on the other hand, is amazing. Long battery life and fast, swift responses to inputs on the keyboard and such are a wonderful plus. Everything works seamlessly, and it's a notch lighter than my previous laptop. I can just about get through a whole day on one charge. The resolution is also amazing, as I'd expect with this being the Retina display. It also fires up really quickly after being put to sleep, and puts you right back in the middle of what you were doing in literally a second. So much faster than what I've become accustomed to.Having grown up on Windows products, I knew OS X would be a new experience and a whole new learning curve, but it wasn't too hard for me to get accustomed to everything. Having used an iOS device since Christmas in 2008, I've been familiar with the interface, so the gestures on the touch pad were, I discovered, virtually the same, save for at least two-finger scrolling amongst maybe a few others. You get the benefit of either pressing the pad to 'click' on something or simply tapping on it to click on something, depending on your preference.I was excited when I bought this to learn that it came with a built-in word processing app, Pages. Having used it, I'm not so sure if it's as beneficial as Word is. Oh sure, it makes your documents look great, no denying that, but for example, the process of figuring out synonyms for a word isn't exactly easily accessible, leaving you to poke around the Internet instead for other word alternatives. Fortunately if you have an available download of Microsoft Office (my MS Office Student package comes with two available installations), it'll work just as fine. It's a slight change abandoning right-click options and instead having to go to the Edit tab at the top of the screen for the Cut/Copy/Paste and other options, but I wouldn't consider it a deal-breaker. Sure, a tad more work, but still manageable. A spell-checking system is built-in as well when you're typing, at least on Safari, which I think is pretty convenient.It's unfortunate that it doesn't come with a CD/DVD drive (unless you want to shell out $80 for the optical drive attachment). Really though, it depends on what you need it for. I still have my old laptop that came with a built-in optical drive, so if something comes up that I need it for, I'll just use that. If it saves me $80, I'm not complaining.What it really boils down to is what you plan on doing with it. If you plan on mainly using it for school or some miscellaneous projects, this model will likely serve your purposes. More ambitious tasks will probably equal out to a need for more memory and flash storage, thus, the more expensive models. If your heart is set on a CD/DVD drive and such, by all means go for the cheaper non-Retina model or pay the $80 for the attachment. Aside from that, and despite very few, very minor hiccups in speed and tasks, this has dealt with everything I've thrown at it.

However my last three Windows laptops (Sony, HP, and Lenovo) all have had hardware issues, so I decided to give a Mac a try. I also had no intentions of getting a Windows 8 laptop.First off, the new Mac Book Pros are very thin. They did away with ethernet ports, the CD player, and a HDD to achieve this. My friend bought a Pro last year, and when I showed him this, he thought it was an Air. Its that thin.The HDD was replaced with SSD. While I don't like the capacity (128GB), I don't ever want a HDD again. This laptop literally boots to the desktop in SECONDS.The Retina display is awesome. Unfortunately, many pictures on the internet are pixelated because of this and its distracting with how clear the text of websites are (Attn: Amazon). Range of view also seems to be better than my previous laptops. I wasn't looking forward to the smaller screen size (and the adjustment was irritating), but my other laptops feel like dinosaurs compared to this and after use, I think 13.3in is a very reasonable and nice screen size.The trackpad speaks for itself, nothing beats it.I've seen some complaints of sound quality, but the speakers are better than the Dolby speakers on my Lenovo.As others have said, the battery is long lasting. Even though my Lenovo had a pretty decent battery life, I always had it plugged in. With the Macbook, something about it seems more portable as I rarely ever have it plugged it and the battery lasts for 7+ hours (and charges rather quickly too). Every time I've closed the screen (sometimes for hours), the battery percent has never changed.The switch from Windows 7 to OS X was challenging for a day or so, but once adjusted, its smooth and user friendly and I might actually prefer it.All in all, this is a good laptop that I would recommend to anyone.", "Date": "December 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is how laptops should be build!", "Author": "Highrise", "ReviewID": "R3956NM84QOYMK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Mac.
