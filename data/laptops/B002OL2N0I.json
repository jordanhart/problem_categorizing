{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Acer 1410 equivalent, but better for US market.", "Author": "Jennethfranco", "ReviewID": "R1JE7XLO5P5ZB6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are things that surprised me upon receiving this notebook:1. This can play HD videos in Youtube and Hulu without a hiccup (if you have good bandwidth of course).2. Upgrading HDD, RAM and even network card is a breeze as the access panels are well laid out in the bottom, and all said components are within reach upon opening. No need to open the top and take the keyboard out like with some other notebooks.3. LCD quality is surprisingly good and easy on the eyes.4. Overall build quality is above average for the price point.This notebook looks and feels much better than the images provided here would make you think. By now everybody should know that this is extremely similar Acer's 1410, down to the quirks such as missing bluetooth despite presence of bluetooth button, etc. which is not surprising now that Acer owns Gateway.However, there are subtle differences and I bought this over the Acer 1410 because of the following:1. The keyboard layout is US version, whereas that of the 1410 is European. (At least if you check the 1410's images they are)2. The touchpad is recessed, so less fumbling into that area. Most users complain about the 1410's touchpad being flush.3. This is subjective, but I kind of liked the faux graphite look on the palmrest compared to the 1410's.But you really couldn't go wrong with either product. These are just what tipped me to get this one over the other.", "Date": "October 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "not too carefull", "Author": "Elias A.", "ReviewID": "R3FZ0DPKNNL6K4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i was very anxious to use my new notebook...

I purchased it based on some quick, but diligent research and felt satisfied with the cost vs value reviews previously posted on this site.However, after successfully receiving this product and having some satisfactory use of it for a few days without any major problems, apart from the usual Windows Vista difficulties, I discovered that the laptop would not WAKE UP anymore from its sleep or hibernate mode. Permanent \"COMA\"!Unfortuntaley, as I am no longer in the US, I am now left with the frustration and incredible inconvenience of not be able to use it or even exchange this product covered under warranty, without having to incurr extraordinary shipping expenses (that cost as much as the laptop) by returning it back to the retailer or manufacturer in the US, due to the lack of international support they provide.Its a damn shame, as I thought that with the Gateway/Acer union, I would be guaranteed international support. A far distant truth.A complete waste of time, energy and money!", "Date": "July 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "I Like This Laptop, but the speaker is not loud enough .....", "Author": "MM", "ReviewID": "RW3T5HHV31SGI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is light and excellent.But two things I don't like :1.

It had 32-bit Windows Vista Home Premium operating system installed. Since I already purchased a 64-bit Windows 7 Professional upgrade disc, I installed it on the Gateway after making back-up discs for the 32-bit Vista drivers. The 64-bit upgrade went smoothly. An external DVD drive is needed to install the Windows 7 Professional upgrade disc. Also, to get the hardware virtualization switched on for the Windows XP mode, a different BIOS has be used. The Acer website has a compatible BIOS for their Aspire 1410 laptop (I learned that from another customer review on this website). The Acer BIOS already has virtualization switched on. The touchpad works best with the original driver and the webcam works the original driver as well. A really good little package for the money. I'll have to get at least one 2GB memory chip, for a total of at least 3GB of RAM. That will allow more memory for the XP mode to run faster. The 64-bit Windows 7 Professional boots-up fast and runs great. The Intel Core 2 Solo processor SU3500 is reasonably fast, and screen display is sharp. The HDMI works great with big screen TV's.", "Date": "July 22, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very Nice Upgrade from a netbook", "Author": "Samuel Chon", "ReviewID": "RE35K0R4QI2UF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I decided to go with this item because at the time of purchase $349 for a larger netbook with a better processor, 720p, HDMI out and up to 4GB ram supported is a deal.1.  Out of the box, its running vista home 32 bit.  there was a free upgrade to windows7, but it has since expired.2. not too much bloatware3. Kind of an issue:  recovery discs, they can only be made with an external DVD.  My old samsung netbooks came with a recovery solution that made image that were saved on the D drive. you didnt need an external burner4. Ok, another minor gripe. my other netbooks all came with 2 partitions: C drive, for the OS and my documents and a D drive, for the other stuff, and if you did a wipe, or revert back to factory settings, your stuff on the D Drive was saved.  Not the case with this setup5. Jolicloud:  it fully supported from what I can see.  But i did have to download and install Acer BIOS 4410 A_A .  this machine must also be re labeled and sold as an acer 1410.  When running this flavor of linux, its pretty good as well6. Speakers stink on this.  not very loud at all.  I use headphones almost all the time now.7. the LED backlit display.  its not as crisp with some video. you can see more pixelation.Vista home is not bad, but since i hear it supports window 7 64 bit, i am going to upgrade, and get the 4 GB of ram.but out of the box, it runs nice.overall for 349 bucks, shipped, tax free?  you cant beat this, when other larger netbooks all go for over 400 bucks, closer to 500.if anyone has a solution for the recovery disc work around to make iso files.. let me know.maybe a virtual burner drive?", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "I love this laptop", "Author": "Jose Campos \"tOnY cAmPoS\"", "ReviewID": "R2XI0KGD14KSWP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am more than happy with the Gateway EC18. Before I got this, I spent a lot of time searching for a netbook to use in my classes, and for browsing the web. With the Gateway EC18 and the Core Solo processor I can do that and a lot more in less time. The 11.6\" screen is short enough for portability and big enough so that you don't have to strive to view web pages or videos.Battery life is more than I could expect, with WIFI enabled surfing the web, viewing youtube videos and chatting in live messenger I get more than 2 and a half hours. With dimmed screen light, WIFI off, listening to music and using spreadsheets I get almost 6 hours.I upgraded for free to windows 7 and everything works perfectly. I only had a problem with boot time on initial installation of windows 7 BUT an update of the bios solved the issue. If you have that problem the bios update is not on the gateway download site. I found it on Acer site, on the downloads of the Acer Aspire 1410, which is the same computer just with different casing and branding.I definitely recommend this laptop, it's fast, it's small, it's lightweight.

I always felt that the netbook was too small, slow and basic for me. This turned out to be just the right size in terms of the screen, the hard drive and the speed of the processor. It is a bit slower (11.2 in., not 10.3) than a regular-sized notebook, but it does everything else just fine. The bettery life is great, over 6 hours and the size is great for traveling. I am not sure if this is classified as a notebook or a netbook, I have seen it in both places. I updated from Vista to Windows 7 without any problems, the copmuter works jsut fine. You may want to use the regular version of Win & and not the basic one.

I went with this one over a netbook to get a little more power.  I've been very happy with what it provides.  Main purpose for purchase was to have something portable, and with an HDMI output.AdvantagesIt is only 3 lbs (1/3rd the weight of my 17\" laptop), so it is easy to take around the house, or for travel.The wireless N is great, so I am able to network my computers, and stream video between them.The HDMI slot is very convenient for hooking it up to the TV for video playback.Between the wireless N and the HDMI, I can stream HD video and play it on the TV.Price: I got it for around $350, which I think is a great value for what it provides.  It was the cheapest I could find a laptop with all the features above.DisadvantagesNo optical slot makes it a little more difficult to add software, but it does decrease the weight.  I was able to network my computers and use the drive from the other computer (this also worked for loading Windows 7).It takes a long time to come out of sleep mode, but that could be due to Windows more than the computer itself.Something with wrong with Windows 7 a couple weeks after I loaded it, so I had to re-load it.
