The best idea is to buy a $20 USB Wifi receiver to go with it if you do intend on buying this laptop.Otherwise, it's well worth the money you pay for it.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Product for the Price", "Author": "Darlene Nicholson", "ReviewID": "R2JMP4EL5RRD7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've used this laptop every day since receiving it and haven't had any issues.

I bought this laptop in December after my Dell Studio 1555 died for the the third time in about four years. At first, there were many things to like about this laptop: It has a smooth and sleek texture, incredible storage (750 gb), its speedy, and its affordable. However, it did not take long for me to find some negatives. My minor complaints are that I found the keyboard to be too large because of unnecessary number pad to the right, the touch pad was clanky, and I was disappointed that my laptop did not come with the backlit keyboard. My MAJOR complaint about this laptop was one I encountered on the first night of its arrival; wifi connectivity issues. In certain parts of my house I was not able to connect to the internet or maintain a connection. The Lenovo wifi struggle is REAL. This apparently is an issue that Lenovo buyers are familiar with all too often. I called Lenovo and they failed to help and told me to contact my internet provider. My internet provider shipped a new router to the house, but by the time it came I had already sent the laptop back. I doubt the router would have solved the issue. I ended up doing the unimaginable and bought the new macbook pro with retina display. I never thought I would buy an Apple computer, but that's a whole 'nother review. Long story short, I probably stay away from Lenovos.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Lappy", "Author": "M.

Specifically you can't boot it from a livecd, and I've had difficulty getting a liveusb to work either.

So much.  I would marry it.  It is fast and runs all of my imaging and audio programs flawlessly and I love the extra features like the back lit keyboard and the touch screen.  Super fun.  Mine has the i5-3230M, not sure if that makes much of a difference.  And I have a 1 TB hard drive.  But I think it is still this same model.  It is a powerhouse for the money.  I love it so much I even managed to learn wacky Windows 8!  I have had it for a month now and not one problem.  Streams like the wind.  No problems with the wifi or the touch pad or any of the stuff folks here have mentioned.

I have the upgraded one with the i7-3520M processor, 8 gigs of RAM and 1TB HDD.I hated Win8 however so I downloaded a freeware program called Start Menu 8 which configures the desktop to look like Windows 7. I agree with the other reviewers that it has great build quality and runs blisteringly fast. Backlit keyboard is awesome. Runs very cool. I've had no problems with the wireless card. Very little bloatware. The only drawback is that the keyboard is somewhat hard to type on, compared to other laptops I've owned. Trackpad has a lot of features similar to a smartphone with two-finger scroll, three-finger swipe, etc, so make sure you investigate that thoroughly to learn all the cool features it has.

This is the best Laptop I ever had. Its slim, quiet and performance is great. I bought mine from best buy. And I would say this as advice: Don't buy a computer online unless you you're building it yourself. I bought an Acer. They may make some good computers, that one cost me the lost of some precious video and pictures. So I am giving the life time ban to Acer. This Lenovo is pretty good.

I will try to click on something and end up clicking around it just due to how sensitive the touchpad is. (fixed! :) )I even set it to lowest sensitivity and to disable the touchpad while I am typing. Regardless, if my palm touches the touchpad while typing, it exits the window and inevitably screws something up. (fixed! :) )Speakers being located at the bottom is weird and makes it hard to watch something with lappy in your lap. (this is still pretty weird)Other than that, it is great. However, the sensitivity gets annoying SO QUICKLY. I ACCIDENTALLY clicked out of this input box 3 times, it gets INFURIATING.
