Not in a hurry though. I take my laptop on my bike with me and it has about 4,000 miles on it so far with no problems.

It's a no frills package. No brochures, no discs, no molded packing. Just a laptop, battery & power brick in bubble wrap. All components, inputs and outputs perform as advertised. I've seen prettier refurbs and I've seen worse. I would buy from this vendor again.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "Marcus House", "ReviewID": "R2KKCVNCCI4DYC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The price is great but you get Garbage. Within 1 week of buying I see that the keys on the keyboard stops working. You will hit a J and it thinks you are trying to do F2 or screen swap. The only way to get out of this is to log off and log back in. The hot keys at the top of the keyboard are swapped. So F5 does not do refresh. I have never been able to successfully connect wirelessly with my printer. Now after about 2 years, entire folders disappear. What do I mean by that? Well you can go to Windows Explorer (file manager) and you can go to your My documents folders and you can see your \"Kids\" folder (as an example) but if you write a word document and then go to save it, the \"kids\" folder within your My documents folder cannot be seen. So what I have to do is save it to my desktop and then move it manually to the kids folder. This also means that for the most part if I want to send an email with an attachment I need to save to the file to my desktop to ensure I will be able to find the file to attach to the email for sending. I bought this laptop brand new and before this I had a Compaq Presario CQ60 that went bad a few short years after buying brand new. I am really starting to think I should avoid all HP laptops all together.", "Date": "June 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "This Is Typical HP Trash!!!!", "Author": "TOMMYG", "ReviewID": "RXBNAPK2LSDO0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Buggy As Hell!

It  is a nice laptop with good features. The only thing I don't like about it is that the speakers suck. You can change them in the SRS sound settings, however they still aren't great. No big deal, I just use speakers. However, I would just buy the new model. They put the speakers above the keyboard (were I believe they should have been in the first place) in the new model whereas they are at the ends of the computer in this model. If you want to update to windows 8 you can, but I actually prefer Windows 7 because windows 8 isn't compatible with a lot of programs because it is relatively new.You should also be aware that this is an HP computer, so the battery life won't be stellar.I hope this helps", "Date": "April 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0096CL9RQ"}}
