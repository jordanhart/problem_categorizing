{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great tablet, but is actually the \"Light\" version", "Author": "Orthodoc", "ReviewID": "R26P2V73G6CWWZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought the S6000 tablet from Lenovo.com directly, rather than this version offered, as they offer a 32GB hard-drive memory.  This version states only 16GB.  In any case, I am extremely satisfied with this tablet, and find it to be a great alternative to the iPad.  It is just as thin, but with a larger screen and better price.  I personally find the Android platform much easier to navigate, switch between windows, change the settings, and frankly, a whole lot easier to download apps!  No username, no password, no hassle.  Only when you first turn it on to use, is it slower than the iPad.  But, if it has only been dormant, then it activates just as fast.Lenovo.com notes 2 versions:  S6000 and S6000L.  The 'L' version does not have a rear-facing camera or micro-HDMI port.  It has only 16GB hard-drive memory.  Their S6000 version has 32GB hard-drive, has front and rear-facing cameras & the HDMI port.  I do not understand why this version offered states that it has only 16GB hard-drive.  In addition, the specs listed do not note the front-facing camera, although the written description does mention it.  However, both versions can take a MicroSD card, to add memory, and have a micro-USB port for charging or attaching accessories.  (Et tu, Apple?).Also, I bought the matching Lenovo Bluetooth keyboard / magnetic cover (on Amazon for about 1/2 of list price), made specifically for this tablet by Lenovo.  It supports the tablet for surfing, reading, emails, and so forth.  It neatly attaches magnetically, which automatically puts the tablet into dormant (sleep) mode immediately, saving the battery, as well as protecting the screen.  No need for any additional cover.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "My First Tablet, But Not My First Rodeo", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"jebert6\"", "ReviewID": "R2FWXVA8SFRG7F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although I had not owned a tablet prior to purchasing my S6000 a few weeks ago, I had listened closely to friends, family, and colleagues about their experiences with a variety of different makes and models of tablets.  I then did extensive research on the tablets available that met my criteria (screen size, weight, processor speed, onboard storage, and screen clarity) and fell into my price range ($200-$350).  I did various comparisons on Best Buy's site, Amazon, Office Depot, etc; all of which pointed me to the S6000.  So, I bought it and haven't regretted it one moment since.  It works flawlessly, doesn't get stymeid by multiple apps running, and feels great in my hands.  If you choose to buy the S6000, then you truly must consider getting the very inexpensive, but invaluable Lenovo keyboard (Bluetooth).  On Amazon its only around $30-$40 (new) and works beautifully.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great buy!", "Author": "K.

Love the bigger screen and the lightweight feel, yet sturdy construction.  Also, faster than my previous tablets, and just such a great buy for a 10 inch screen.  I love the HDMI port, my 8.9 inch had one as well and I've found very few tablets that actually have it.  I caught mine on sale at $199.99 on Amazon, but at $219 still think it's a steal considering the size and quality.  The only complaint I can possibly come up with is that they came out with an even lower priced 10 inch screen when my 8.9 inch was perfectly fine.  Thrilled with that extra 1.1 inch - really a great great buy!  Thanks Lenovo!!", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very happy with this.", "Author": "A.

It is easy to use and he likes the big screen. True, there are 10-inch tablets out there with screens that have much higher resolutions than this one (and you'll pay more for them, too). But the screen is more than adequate. It connects just fine to WiFi and is fast enough for what we need it to do. It is *very* thin -- I'm not sure I've seen a tablet as thin as this one is.One thing to note: the dimensions are odd. This does not affect use at all, but it's something to keep in mind if you want to buy a case. You'll do best looking for a case that is made for this model Lenovo Ideatab. It's taller and narrower than the iPad or the Kindle Fire, so you'll have a hard time getting a generic-sized case (one-case fits many models) to fit it. The thinness of the tablet makes that even more true.

The display is crisp and responsive, and the battery lasts long enough for me to do my homework and then let the kids play on it for a couple of hours.The reason it is 4 stars instead of 5 is that even though the Android version is Jellybean 4.2.2 and should have the ability to make multiple user accounts, Lenovo apparently doesn't have this option for this tablet. I'm hoping they will remedy this soon, since I'd like my kids to be able to play games without being all up in my stuff, but in product forums I see they've been asking for a remedy for about six months, so I'm not holding my breath.

I have been using this tablet for 4 months and I'm loving it.  Fast and responsive.  Able to turn it on real quick (about less than 20 sec)... at this time, probably that because I don't have that many apps that boot at the startup.  It has huge memory, 16GB; in addition, I can add more storage by inserting microSD card.  I can connect this tablet to any monitor or tv with HDMI slot.  Battery life is good enough... about 6 hours.I think that it is durable.  It can tolerate bumps and thuds.

It is far superior to the 100 dollar cheap tablets you find, and it doesn't cost 500 dollars like some of the premier tablets.  This tablet has been very stable, connects to wife easily,  does not freeze up, and does everything it is asked to do.If you are not interested in dropping 500 on one of the new Samsung Galaxy Tablets, or other high quality and highly promoted brand name tablet, I would definitely recommend this one.

After fully charged it again, I turn it on when I needed, turn it off when I don't need, it last a week for my not frequent use.I put in a 64GB micro SD Kingston HC card, it immediately recognize it and showed up as 63GB SD card storage.  I am still playing with it and decide the best way to partition the large storage I have.  When connect to the PC, please take a look on the top left corner, there is a small USB icon.  This will allows you to use this same USB port to connect to an external USB hdd, or allow computer to connect to this tablet as external flash drive.  I changed that to media drive, so that my Windows 7 PC will show this tablet as an storage.If you have a CallCentric SIP account, you can also install a sip phone client, like LinPhone free app, then this tablet will act like a real phone. You can call and receive call from this tablet, as long as you have wifi connection.  There is a google voice app, but that will not allow you to make or receive phone call from this.  Rather just provides you another phone number.  I found CallCentric dirty cheap number is very good. I was able to make and receive calls when I was on an oversea trip.I love the Lenovo quality.

It is replacing an iPad.  For $200 instead of $500, it's a pretty solid deal.  Tablet is fast.  Plays games.  Very well.  Very nice IPS display.Some things are annoying though:1. Application list isn't sorted alphabetically.  Only sorts by install time (or I can't figure out how to change it).  A better index makes it easier to find apps that are installed and you want to put on the home screen or uninstall.2. The Lenovo UI on top of Android looks nice, but the folders they provide do not work as cleanly as one would expect.  They're nice, but could be better.3. Resolution could be higher, but it's adequate and expected at this price point.  And, of course I knew that going in.The Android 4.2.2 does not let you use App2SD.  I had to root mine and then I use Link2SD and FolderMount (paid version) to shift applications to the SD card.  This requires partitioning the SD card, I made mine 85% FAT32 and 15% ext4.  Reason being is that FolderMount pushes data only to the first partition, while Link2SD uses the 2nd part.  Since most new games are mostly large data, that strategy seems like it will work for me.The hack requirement is due to Google locking down Android more than it used to...  But, at least there's this workaround.If it all worked out of the box and required no manual manipulation, I'd give it 5.  If you don't plan on using lots of apps, 5 stars as well.If you're uncomfortable rooting your tablet and messing with SD cards, then it probably is 3 stars for you.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but not the best.", "Author": "R.D.", "ReviewID": "R1MTLU6PL9F1PU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was very happy when I bought it.

I see the price has gone up a little but this is still a good deal for the hardware, screen size, resolution, and features you get versus an iPad or full blown Windows tablet. The Andriod OS (4.2.2 Jelly Bean) is pretty intuitive and very responsive on this platform. The app store (Google Play) is easy to use, it's simple to find and install all your favorite apps.I have one nit-picky little complaint. The Bluetooth keyboard I bought bundled seems to time out too quickly. I'm sure there's a setting in the preferences to make the timeout longer. But I haven't found a convenient way to reconnect it after a timeout other than going into the Bluetooth settings and touching the paired keyboard entry again. It connects instantly but it's a little inconvenient to stop what I'm doing to go back into the settings.On a positive note, the performance of this tablet is impressive. Apps, pictures, documents, etc, load almost instantly. I've never had a problem connecting to wifi hotspots or email accounts, both of which I have numerous. The native apps are very good at playing music, viewing pictures, managing files, web surfing, etc. But we all have our favorite apps for those tasks and all of mine run just fine on this platform.All in all, I've been waiting a long time for a machine that does what I want for a price I'm willing to pay. This tablet fit the bill. I suggest getting the suggested bundle of cover, keyboard, and an additional SD card for extra storage. They all work well together. I even bought a microUSB adaptor so that I can attach thumbdrives or other external media, and a microHDMI adaptor so that I can attach the tablet to a TV or monitor.

The app loads and starts but when you select programming you get the spinning circle and it times out. Went on Lenovo's forum and found that others are having the same issue. I would recommed you read the Lenovo Ideapad forum prior to purchase. There are many complaints about the S6000 and other models of the Ideapad line. One major complaint seems to be that Lenovo never updates to the newest versions of Android. You are stuck with whatever is loaded on the unit when you buy. If I'd have read the forum before purchase I would have looked elsewhere.
