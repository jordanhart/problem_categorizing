{"Reviews": [{"Title": "it's great for a cheap laptop", "Author": "howes", "ReviewID": "R2N53OATGZEXFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We bought this for our 13 year old daughter for Christmas. The seller was great to work with. The original one was delivered with a broken screen. It looked like fedex dropped it the corner of the box was smooshed in where the screen was broken and of coarse like all shippers coming to our address they leave it on the doorstep and don't even ring the doorbell so we couldn't really dispute the damage. He replaced it and reimbursed us for the return shipping. Works well but she broke an arrow key after about 2 days. Im sure that was her fault. Other than that it works about the same as any other laptop i've used. It doesnt overheat even when she is playing sims and she has it stuffed full of programs already and it hasn't seemed to slow down any.", "Date": "March 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "LapTop", "Author": "Jgoose", "ReviewID": "R2KWDI6W5FWHAL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Fast shipping!
