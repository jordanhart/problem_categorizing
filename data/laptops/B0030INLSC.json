{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing Computer!!", "Author": "Yasmin Dudley", "ReviewID": "R20XNAIQV5W3AC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Where do I start, I have been researching laptops for the last 6 months, looking at specs etc. I needed to replace my laptop that has become outdated. I bought a Dell 5 years ago that was just too slow to watch videos, download anything or keep up with all of the new software upgrades. I wanted a laptop with speed, good memory, decent video graphics, large enough hard drive so that I wouldn't be changing it soon. Plus I wanted an expandable computer in terms of memory so that I wouldn't be limited at a really good price.It is a 15.6 inch, 2.3G processing speed and 4G memory, with 320 Hard drive it is fast, you can view most of the HD videos clearly they finally load for me on You Tube..lol I need one also for work at home, since I use it for a lot of number entries. This is one of the best if not the best keyboards w/10 key numeric pad. I have large fingers and it is comfortable and easy to use it is set up just like an adding machine for accountants, or bookkeepers. There is just enough texture and grip of the keys for fast and easy typing. Another thing I loved about it was the gray interior it shows less visible fingerprints and dust for those who don't like the glossy black of most Toshiba's out there.It was easy to set up I was so worried about how long it would take. I had already had a wireless network so all I did was boot up created a password and sign on, the connected to my wireless network and I was on the net. Yes to some it might have too much bloatware(unnecessary programs) but for those who are not as computer savvy it includes all the files to get you up and running but you need to update them from time to time. The camera is so easy to use and Skype is already set up.When I bought it was a much better deal it is bright and easy to use for night viewing, especially if you watch movies or download movies online. I have just had it for a month but as long as you have a good registry cleaner program to clean up Windows 7 it should continue to run fast. One downer is I wish Toshiba would come with the Operating System disks included it is irritating to have to copy them on your own.Overall you cannot get most of the specs like a large comfortable full size keyboard, with a 15.6 inch TruBrite screen, webcam 1.3 pixel, 320G Hard drive, ATI graphics, labelfish for your CD/DVD, 2.3G AMD processor with 4G memory for this price you cannot compare. Plus it is lightweight easy to move from room to room. So far very happy with my purchase.", "Date": "March 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "What's Wrong With this Laptop?", "Author": "John Guzlowski", "ReviewID": "RP5OE013OV1SK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "If you read the 4 and 5 star reviews you'll get a sense of what works on this computer.But they may not mention that two things are in fact annoying.1.  The sound quality on the speakers is awful.  If you want to hear music or watch a movie, you'll have to have speakers.2.  The battery life is way short.  Usually about an hour and thirty minutes.  Keep your plug handy.", "Date": "July 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love my Toshiba", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1VN6AI9TVY5NV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had been looking for a new laptop for quite some time when I came across the reviews on Amazon about this model. I had been advised by a computer-whiz son of mine to look for a Toshiba this time around, since in his opinion (he's a computer engineer) they are well-made and predominantly trouble-free. So when I found this computer, and read the reviews on its performance, I was sold. Now that I've used it for a couple of weeks, I have to agree. It's a sweet computer for the price. The keyboard is great, and since I do a lot of typing, I like how it feels. The Web-cam feature works great. And I love Windows 7 so far. The battery lasts about 2-3 hours, which is typical for a laptop. The screen resolution is great.

It is great for the things I do every day. I use it to complete assignments and to surf the internet. I have found that though this laptop has HD sound (yes it's awesome) the system speakers do it no justice, they are low and not great quality. I plugged in my earbuds and was blown away!!! I haven't tried it with external speakers yet but I will soon. My second issue is the two USB ports. To remedy that I brought a usb hub. Overall I am loving my Toshiba Satellite L505-E5025. If you are looking for a great inexpensive system, I highly recommend this one. I have the AMD processor and it's working great for me. Consider buying antivirus software and MS office when buying this product because it only comes with trial version of Norton and MS Office 07.", "Date": "March 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Solid laptop & great value", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R1XE2UTX55WCHV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The L505 was a good choice for me. In the middle of a large dissertation, I had to dump my old beloved 2004 Gateway to keep up with Microsoft's constant system upgrade demands. The Toshiba is a bit heavy for a laptop but it has a solid feel for my mostly desktop use. Mousepad functionality is spotty but I rely mainly on a mouse.  It is fast and (thus far) my McAfee installs happen quickly and quietly in the background without my even noticing. My only complaint is the squat dimensions of screen.  The 15.6\" \"Tru-bright\" screen is nice and bright, but the screen ratio makes it wide and short. If you are a document writer (vice an Excel jockey or primarily an internet surfer) you are giving up a lot of good screen space for documents. The wide dimensions make for other annoyances ... the power plug and USB port (only 2) with a thumb drive inserted on the right side require that you keep your mouse-arm splayed wide-right. Why not put these ports in the back?  Otherwise, for my $540, this is a great machine.  I looked at Dells in the same price range and they seem cheap and plasticky in comparison.  Unfortunately, we are getting to the age of disposable laptops, in which it is easier to buy a new one than to upgrade. Perhaps cheap and plasticky, low and squaty, are the wave of future.", "Date": "May 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "exactly what I want  //  justo lo que queria", "Author": "Rodolfo Alvarez", "ReviewID": "R1DPULLVB133SN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Esta laptop me ha venido a solucionar muchas necesidades de la universidad - que fue para lo que la compre.

I wsn't sure I would like a Wide Screen, but I love it and would never go back to a regular size screen. As far as how it works, it's fast, has a great size keyboard and easier than I thought it would be to set up the way you want it. Love the built-in Web Cam. You can also see everything that is downloaded on your computer from the Start Menu !  I just love it and would buy another one if I ever needed it and would recomend it to everyone.

I did a lot of research prior to purchasing.  For the most part I love it.  However ... I had read warnings about the poor sound quality of the speakers and just wrote it off as coming from someone with unrealistic expectations or someone not used to using a laptop.  WRONG.  These are by far and away the worst speakers on the planet.  I don't see how Toshiba could put these pieces of junk in an otherwise nice laptop.  If I want to listen to ANYTHING I have to drag out the ear buds.  For that reason, and that reason alone, I don't recommend purchase of this model.  My old Toshiba had decent speakers so if you are considering this model .... do yourself a big favor and keep looking.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "great", "Author": "DENNON", "ReviewID": "R2GYULI7SJV3WQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i've had this laptop since april 2010 let me say this is absolutely a great computer there is nothing bad i can say about this .....money well spent", "Date": "January 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Satellite L5052-ES5025", "Author": "Velvet", "ReviewID": "R3JN6JP5IXLF86", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It is a good laptop. This is my first laptop so I really don't have much to compare it to. I have not had any problems except the sound on it is very low and the battery life won't last 2 hours but that wasn't a issue for me, I would just plug it up to the charger. If you are a person that would like to travel with their laptop and use it all over, this one is not for you unless you don't mind using your charger every where you go.

Redick", "ReviewID": "R2CKXALR62AKSW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop to replace my Toshiba Tecra.  My Tecra was slow, crashed frequently, and became almost unusable when paired with my kaspersky Internet Security.  Because of my experiences with that computer I was hesitant to try another Toshiba but was convinved by both the specs and the affordability of this model.  I must say I was completely, pleasantly surprised by how great the Satellite is!  This computer is lightening fast.  I am actually finding myself annoyed by the slowness of my desktop computer now, which is an extremely expensive computer.  It downloads my audio files in record time and uploads my mp4 files to youtube in less than half the time I have been accuostomed to.  I am a transcriptionist and find the keyboard to be very comfortable and efficient for long periods of typing.  The screen is very clear and crisp.  HD appears great on it.  Probably one of my favorite things about it is the Windows 7.  I, like most people, have been extremely dissapointed in Windows Vista and had really high hopes that 7 would be an improvement.  Windows 7 has exceeded my expectations in every way!  I quite often have many windows open at one time and switch back and forth to research the topics I'm writing about and review instructions that have been sent to me via email.  The Windows 7 allows you to view in small or full size every Window you have open without actually navigating away from the Window you're currently working on.  This has been extremely helpful to me.  Everything about Windows 7 has been functional and intuitive and has helped to make me even more productive.  I cannot say enough good things about Windows 7 or the Toshiba Satellite.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fast, affordable, functional laptop.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.
