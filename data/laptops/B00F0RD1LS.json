{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Ultra-fast & smooth!!!", "Author": "Shemoth", "ReviewID": "R2SA0XTN4VVYXJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After having used windows 8 and getting INCREASINGLY annoyed with the UI I badly needed a switch back to a windows 7 based pc.I did a lot of search and finally decided upon the Acer Aspire S3-371-6663.After having used it for less than a month I have to say this ultra-book has exceeded my expectations.NOTE:Amazon has got one info wrong, this product was not launched September2004!Acer launched this product September 2013Build:Ultra-thin design yet durable with its magnesium alloy which supposedly protects it from falls and impact (haven't tested it though\uf04a the thinnest pc I've seen!  Mac book air may be the only exception. Everything in this ultra-book is designed to minimize bulk. Except for the headphone jack all other connectivity are at the back. Champagne color is awesome!Connectivity:Nothing is extra & the number of unnecessary connectivity options have been omitted to make it as sleek as possible!1 * HDMI, 2 * USB 3.0, 1 * Microphone jack, (SD) Card reader, Bluetooth 4.0.SSD:This does not come with SSD, however there is no compromise on speed, it's really fast and I'm able to multitask. It even handles some games. Initially I was planning on buying aspire S3-391-6497(comes with Core i5 & SSD but I'd read somewhere that it produces some fan noise which is why I settled for this model although the configuration of the latter was hard to resist(there is no fan noise in this except a little when installing drivers)SPEED & Battery life:Ultra-fast & smooth performance with Intel Core i3-3217U, 1.8 GHz, 4 GB DDR3 RAM, 500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive. I'm able to have 4-5 windows open at the same time. It even handles gaming well. The startup is lightning fast, in like 4-5 seconds. Wi-Fi signal is great, even with all other devices disconnected this one is stable.Battery life comes for around 31/2-4 hrs, considering it has an inbuilt 3-cell battery it's decent enough.Optical Drive:There is no optical drive which was precisely what I wanted as having one in my opinion is not a great idea as there is every chance of dust accumulation & eventual malfunction. Another disadvantage is that having one always feels like excess baggage! I'm using an external DVD writer.Display:Vivid 13.3\" HD LED display, the perfect size for watching movies & surfing the web, not too small just the right size. I think this is anti-glare display. What I really like is that there is no eye strain even after long hours of viewing. The only downside is that it's not IPS panel & therefore there is slight color deterioration when you view from 178 angles.Windows 7 Vs Windows 8??:Prior to this I had windows 8 (touch screen) pc and the reason for my switch is due to the increasing frustration start screen, search options, so-called `APPS' & virtually everything else in the newer UI, I decided it was time to switch. Windows 8 reminds me of windows vista, when launched. Microsoft decided to complicate things a little & it failed!I'm guessing windows 8 were designed for touch screen note books. It makes sense as far as tabs or phones are concerned, but why would anyone want to touch the screen of a notebook where you have a track pad & fully fledged key board??Now after several years, using windows 7 is like meeting a familiar friend.Cons:Sound quality poor & could have been IPS panel.All in all a great machine worth every penny considering a price tag of 500!Some Recomemded Must-haves for this ultra-book:1)Mcafee Total Protection 2014.2)LG AP70NS50/GP40NB40, external DVD Writer with M-DISC Support.3)Logitech M510 Wireless Mouse.4)JVC HA-S160 FLATS headphones / Philips SHB7000WT/28 bluetooth headphones.5)Case Logic LHS-113-BLACK 13.3\" MacBook Pro and PC Sculpted Sleeve.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this computer - really awesome find", "Author": "CAdreaminzzz", "ReviewID": "R1LUGR0UGZ8IV7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This wound up really fitting my needs.

BrennanDubbs", "ReviewID": "R30O3XU60745NW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update. 1.5 months owner. S3, I don't know about the s5 or s7's which look similar.  Use a mouse and you wont cursing at  the unpredictable key pad of the S3 Acer models  which will highlight files and move them to other directories, paragraphs in Word that suddenly are highlighted and disappear or move. The key pad is a major distraction to getting work done.  Putting a wireless mouse on the machine relieves some of this issue and then turn off keypad... but working without a mouse was the point wasn't it?The pad continues with an imperceptible touch \"do things\". Zoom the page in or out. Block and move a word, paragraph, file or directory. Then amazingly, requires a firm hit to get it to do what you intentionally needed. I'm trying hard to not use a banned word here to describe the key pad.  You get the drift. Be ready to use a mouse, and off click the UNDU feature when typing.  Again, I enjoy the size, lightweight, screen, speed.xxxxxxxxxxxxxVery nice, but you may note that as reported battery life is short, manageable at 3 hrs, but that's rather short.  Investing $100 in a backup external battery that weighs a pound will provide you with enough power for a flight across the States, but not to Europe and certainly not Asia.  If you are near a power outlet frequently, then you're good to go.  nextthe keypad or finger mouse pad is frequently / too sensitive, suddenly the page zooms smaller and you swear you were not touching it, and then it's not sensitive enough and you pound the pad to activate the pad. grr  With key pads having been around for decades, you might think Acer could install a proper key pad.  My Acer Aspire pad is excellent, no issues, excellent little compter.  This pad is a pain several times in the course of typing a one page document and eats up my time to fix what ever it's just decided to do. Next having the USB's at the back is pretty dumb. Power outlet on the back is ... dumb. Rarely used items put on the back, features used all the time, put on the side. The USB especially...  durrrr.  I'm keeping the laptop.Pros.  It's fast, starts and shuts down fast. Transfers document/photos with 3.0usb fast.  Light weight... other than I have to carry around the power cord everywhere (1 pound of dangling wire) because of the not so long battery life.  I'll make do, but I expected Acer to do better. The little 10inch Aspire has been excellent with many trips around the planet, riding in kayaks, on the back of yaks, my backpack... just a great little guy. I've had the laptop 30 days, it's still working fine.", "Date": "April 11, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little laptop for the price!", "Author": "Ermias T.

It is heavier and thicker than I expected. It makes a loud staticky noise whenever it is processing a command. The trackpad is rough and not very responsive; two-finger scrolling is difficult and not very good. It has been a little laggy switching between window tabs, though I'll give it more time to see if that's a constant or just something it's getting used to. The sound quality is pretty poor, though that's what speakers are for.Irritatingly, it also has \"home\" and \"end\" as function commands, rather than as their own buttons. I've seen this on other machines too and in my opinion it is a BIG MISTAKE. Who uses page up/down more often than home/end??It is definitely an attractive machine, and what a relief to have Windows 7 - I was working with a Windows RT machine before this, which is basically all your computer fears come to life. So this is way better. I will try to remember to come back after I've had it for a couple of months, to leave an updated review. I guess for $480+tax, you can't really expect all that much. But I'm still a bit disappointed.", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good machine spoiled by a temperamental touch-pad mouse", "Author": "Tyge", "ReviewID": "R1760E9TXQ00K4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Generally good value for the money, but the touch-pad  mouse is a huge nuisance - it frequently locks and won't work at all, then it abruptly marks an entire paragraph, or suddenly the document starts scrolling down and it's difficult to stop it.  When I try to write with it I spend 1/4 of my time fighting the mouse.  I have not been able to find any way to change the adjustments - that is probably a problem with Windows 7, since microsoft seems to regard clear operating instructions as old fashioned.  I bought this because I had an older super light-weight Acer that I liked, that was finally dying - it worked a lot better than this one.I will probably end up carrying a usb mouse when I travel.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Loving it", "Author": "Audrey", "ReviewID": "R1XEF0G9KMWXEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great battery lifelove the light weight designgreat portability for schoolrelatively fast download speeddecent soundgood graphics", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am shocked about how good this laptop is!", "Author": "AmirAli Bagher Zadeh", "ReviewID": "R2Q54991PIVC10", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For this price there is no way you can get a better laptop! runs smooth, without problem, great keyboard, great everything.
