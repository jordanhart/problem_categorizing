{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very innovative notebook", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "R1874X0ISAUW9K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got to use this laptop for a few days and it's brought me dangerously close to buying one for myself.  If you are looking for a thin-and-light notebook with great battery life and a little gaming life under the hood this is (in my opinion) the best choice on the market today.  What sets this notebook apart is two things:1. At the push of a button you can switch from a low power Intel 4500HD graphics processor to a higher power NVidia G210M with 512MB DDR3 RAM (this defaults on when plugged in and defaults off when unplugged).2. At the push of a button you can enable the \"Turbo 33\" mode which uses a mix of hardware (such as overclocking the cpu) and software to boost performance by up to 33%.  I ran some basic benchmarks and it seemed to work pretty well.CPU - The 1.3GHz Intel SU7300 Core 2 Duo Processor 3MB Cache 800MHz FSB is a great fit.  Some of the thin-and-lights in this class ship with either a Core Solo (i.e. single core) or Celeron CPU.  I tend to avoid both because the single core CPUs tend to choke on all the Internet Security software you need these days and the Celerons come with cut-down cache and now power saving modes.RAM - The included 4GB of DDR3 is just the right amount to really start taking advantage of a 64 bit O.S.  I also like that Asus used DDR3 which uses less power than DDR2.HDD - It comes with a 500GB hard disk drive which is more than most users need today.  The 5400RPM speed is slower than the 7200RPM drive you will find on some models but I prefer the reliability and power savings that come with a 5400RPM drive.DISPLAY - The 13.3 inch widescreen is glossy and reasonably bright.  Outdoor use will suffer from some glare but the backlit screen helps.  I found the vertical viewing angles are a little tight but it wasn't a big deal.GRAPHICS - As mentioned above it switches between a low power Intel 4500HD graphics chip on the motherboard (fine for most non-gaming tasks) and a more power hungry NVidia G210M that will actually let you do a some 3D gaming (though newer games will still run best at reduced settings).  This simple and clever innovation really sets Asus apart.  Oh and either chipset can do 1080P HD video.Battery - It's rare to get a battery this good in a notebook this thin: 8 cell 5600mAh.  I couldn't get the claimed 12 hours of battery life but I got very close (doing a normal mix of MS Office tasks and web browsing I got just shy of 11 hours).  Even doing very compute intensive tasks like gaming or playing back video I went over 6 hours.  Most notebooks can't run Word that long.Touchpad - At first I hated the touchpad but as I got used to it I really liked it.  It two-finger scrolling and three-finger right click which may trip you up at first but after a few days you won't want to go back.It comes with most of the usual stuff: HDMI port (for an external monitor or compatible TV), Ethernet port, wireless b/g/n, 3 USB ports, headphone jack, microphone jack, and a vga (for an external monitor).  It does lack any kind of optical drive, so no playing CDs or DVDs without an external drive.  For this you would need the ASUS UL80Vt-A1 14-Inch Thin and Light Black Laptop.  It's a \"thin-and-light\" which as you would guess means it is thin (1\") and light (3.75lbs).  I also found it to be very quiet.  It comes with a facial recognition feature that allows you to login without a password but this was disabled by our IT department so I wasn't able to try it out.I see a lot of notebooks and I've generally been impressed with the build quality of Asus notebooks.  The build on this model looks great and it's helped by the sleek and simple design: no fancy little bits that fall off in a year.  In my opinion this is the thin-and-light to have if you need great battery life but don't want to give up all the fun.  If you don't do any 3D gaming you don't need the Nvidia chipset and you probably should save a little money on a notebook without it such as the nearly identical ASUS UL30A-A2 Thin and Light 13-3-Inch Silver Laptop.  Otherwise this is a great choice for a student or business traveler who likes to do a little gaming.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "This laptop is the BOMB!!! (In a good way)", "Author": "Thomas Schroth \"Just a bit geeky!\"", "ReviewID": "R23V5SINLEWOWN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am told I over analyze purchases and must say I have been watching laptops for a couple of years. My goals were lightweight and portable but not so small I could not read the screen and LONG battery time. After all it is a portable! I tried a 15.6 but what a moose! A 14\" seemed just right but the chassis was bigger and heavier. I was afraid of a 13.3 but then it dawned on me that is was the same resolution as the 14 and only .7\" smaller, not a full inch. I went from store to store lining a 14's up next to a 13.3's and I really could not tell the difference! Listen my fellow middle agers,I have exceptionally poor eyesight so if it worked for me it will for you! (no offense to my eye Surgeon, Dr. Barry Lee, he did a great job with what I gave him to work with!).I have a powerful desktop so I did not need a desktop replacement class Laptop. I also can't stand a slow poke so a netbook was out and so was a celeron. The T6600 CPUS are the sweet spot for price and value and they are plenty snappy but they are power hungry (compared to the SU's). The SU7300 was just the ticket. Yes, I got the TURBO 33 VT version but I don't think that matters at all. I wanted it for bragging rights only. Same goes for the separate GPU, I want to hedge my bets in case I do some vector art editing. I am NOT a gamer.I wrestled with the lack of a DVD drive but hey you can download ANYTHING, DVD drives are really on the way out, don't sweat it!It's worth the size and weight savings. The keyboard is REALLY GREAT, I am not a touch typist and the keys have nice spacing and definition. (I would have paid BIG money for a back lit keyboard but that just narrows the field TOO MUCH. Touchpad is fine also but I live with my Logitech NANO V450 mouse anyway.The battery life is the real deal and that sold me on this unit. I am coming up on 4 hrs with wifi, bright screen, remote desktop, iTunes, 2 browsers and only down 25% on the battery. Seriously! I charge it and leave without the power cord. I really wanted the silver cover after seeing a black one in person it really showed finger prints. Silver is GREAT!Another thing I like about the VT version is a little bit faster DRAM and Bus, I don't believe anyone could tell a difference but it makes me feel like I have the latest and greatest and am hedging my bets regarding being outdated sooner then later. If you need to save a few dollars, don't worry about it!There are no compromises here and if you don't know ASUS, they have been around FOREVER and have been an OEM supplier since, like FOREVER! Don't get hung up on the big name companies, it means nothing! The ONLY complaint is the lack of documentation. I got NOTHING to help me figure out the VT features like discrete graphics switching or the Turbo boost (That's the over clocking feature. It steps the CPU up 33% This is VERY unnecessary, I can not come close to pushing this thing in standard mode.) I suspect most will never adjust these features anyway but HEY ASUS, are you listening? Send me a manual, pdf is fine! If its on here somewhere then you made it too hard to find! :)", "Date": "January 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Light, Powerful, Cost Effective 13.3\", a \"Must Have\"", "Author": "Avid Reader", "ReviewID": "RBY41M9VMTUIR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been following the 13.3\" laptop market for the past year waiting for someone to offer one with a powerful video card at a fairly low price. ASUS has done it with the UL30Vt! This is the second ASUS we have in our household and it definitely does not disappoint -- the build quality is as good or better than the other name brand laptops we have in our stable and I traded a 14.1\" HP for this. I do not regret it.Pros: - Light -- I can carry it one handed anywhere I go and I'm not worried about dropping it.  It is like carrying a spiral notebook! - Great video card -- The laptop automatically switches between an intel video chipset  (low power demand) and a powerful NVIDIA card when as you plug and unplug the laptop  into the powercord. - Great screen -- the HD screen is awesome and looks better than others provided by other  well known brands. - DDR3 Ram -- blazing fast and low power usage. - Intel Power efficient processor -- while the intel chip is rated below 2.0 Mz, it runs  faster than my 2.6Mz chip on my work laptop that also has DDR3 memory. Don't know how,  but it gets better \"Experience Ratings\". Also, you can overclock the chip using ASUS  software, but I haven't needed to. - Cool -- the machine runs cool. I have never had it become uncomfortably warm. - Battery life -- battery lasts a long time. Have put in a 7200 RPM HDD to replace the one  provided by ASUS... and the battery lasts 10 hours or more. - Looks -- holy smokes, looks cooler than my daughter's school MacBook Pro. I cannot  keep her off my machine. - Keyboard -- I was a bit leery of the 'chicklet' keyboard as I learned to type on a a  \"Selectric\". However, the keyboard supports my heavy typing style and hasn't slowed me down.Cons: - A bit more 'bloatware' than I expected, but most was ASUS software to try to make the  machine more 'user friendly' Had fun figuring out what to turn off...Overall?  - A great buy and I'm glad I waited. There are at least two other named brand laptops that offer a similar laptop  (switching video cards to save power) but they run at least twice this price or more. ASUS created a winner here...  ... and I'm the ultimate skeptic of computer hardware.", "Date": "February 6, 2010"}, {"Title": "HDMI issue", "Author": "LGN", "ReviewID": "RNHLSL8R71PWQ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned this laptop for about 10 days now and used it both at home and on the road. That being said...The Good:Absolutely beautiful screen displayVery lightweightBattery life (not anywhere near 12 hours though, closer to 7)The Bad:Rude, non-existent Tech SupportHDMI / Graphics switching is buggyBloatware is overwhelmingKeyboard dropped keystrokes (knd of lke ths) when typing at moderate speeds.My problems began when Win Media player would suddenly \"pop up\" unexpectedly.  I believe this was due to the touch screen being flush w/ the front wrist pad.  Somehow the combination of my keystrokes and inadvertent touchpad entries launched the program.  Solved this by uninstalling media player but shouldn't have had to do this.A journey on Google offered up the suggestion of uninstalling IE8 to solve the keyboard entry lagging and that did seem to help but the jury is still out on that one...As far as the HDMI connection is concerned: One of the reasons I got this particular laptop was for the HDMI port (wanted to watch Netflix on my bedroom TV) so this was perhaps even more upsetting than the keyboard problem and warranted a call to tech support.  Woe to anyone needing to call ASUS tech support.  For my money you are much better off spending a day searching for the answer on Google or dropping the extra bucks if you know a local tech.  My first call ended w/o tech ever picking up and the second, a day later, was answered after about 15 minutes on hold.  Not great but not terrible for tech support waits I guess.  My real problem was with the lack of support and interest I received.  After the requisite \"is the laptop turned on...  is the tv turned on...\" I was told \"It should work.\"  Well duh! I know it SHOULD work!  The problem is that it DOESN'T!  After 10 minutes of this the tech told me that he had done everything that he could do and it must be my HDMI cable (which I had already informed him worked perfectly w/ my DVD player) or my TV was unsupported.  When I mentioned that it could be any number of other things as well he acidly replied \"like WHAT?!\".  Um, maybe the HDMI port is bad?  Maybe the driver is corrupted, how about a bad anything else you can think of on the motherboard?  His suggestion?  Wait for a few days and try again!  If I still had a problem I could call back.  Nice eh?Well, now for the good part.  I did get the HDMI to work on my tv.  How?  Google, perseverance on my part and a very informative laptop help site.  The guru there mentioned that the graphics accelerator that ASUS uses in this, along w/ other UL style laptops, is buggy and screws w/ the displays during certain power stages.  So a simple button push, a tweak in the graphics properties, and I got it working (for now at least).OverallVery attractive, fast to boot (win 7), good battery life, and an absolutely gorgeous screen display that is marred by subpar hardware-driver-software interaction, poorly located touchpad and support that does not come anywhere near deserving of the name.If you get this and it works well out of the box you will probably like it a lot.  If you have to call for help - save yourself the trouble and go for a long walk.  Who knows, it may work when you return.", "Date": "July 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Umm... wow", "Author": "D. Baker", "ReviewID": "R2EL13WQJJQMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a LOT of research on this baby before I bought it and have NOT been disappointed.  I had no issues with it out of the box what so ever.  A couple of things I did, neither of which are necessary for an average user:1.  I did a clean install of Windows 7 64-bit and re-installed all my drivers without a hitch.2.  Over clocked the processor to 1.9 and had no problems at all.  I should also add that I had been using the machine without over clocking it and thought it was plenty speedy.  After the over clock, well, it just got better.I was planning on upgrading to a SSD but I can barely even hear the stock drive when it's spinning and the thing is blazing fast (I can only imagine what people using a faster internal drive or a SSD drive are getting for response times, but I'm very happy with it as is).  I think I'll wait for SSD prices to drop a bit before making that investment.Trackpad wasn't responsive enough for me with the original settings, but it was simple enough to enter the settings and increase the sensitivity.  Found it to be nice to have the dimpled texture as it helps me know when I've moved my finger off the trackpad while navigating the desktop.Display is great.  I guess some people may be used to something I'm not, but the viewing angles are more than good enough for me.  Streamed HD video via Hulu, etc, is crisp and smooth.No problems with the wireless at home, at a cafe, etc.I don't do a lot of laptop gaming since I have a PS3, so I haven't had a chance to give that a go using the discrete Nvidia card.I'm a touch typist so the non-backlit keyboard doesn't bug me, but it might be nice to have.  Probably install one in a few weeks.  The current keyboard is good enough, probably give it 4 or 4.5 stars.  Not as loud as some would make it out to be.The thing is light and I have no problem carrying it around.  I use the Zeroshock case throw it in my backpack no prob.Did I mention that this thing is fast?  Yesterday I had MediaMonkey open playing music/podcasts, 4 youtube videos open but not playing, 6 other browser tabs open in Chrome, a pdf file open, an open office doc open, and doing some PHP work using Kodomo edit on the IIS webserver I setup on it.  I'll try to remember to update this once I get a virtual box up on it running Ubuntu.I'm in love and her name is ASUS.", "Date": "April 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop, Good Performance, Great Looking, Some Flaws", "Author": "Cristian Toader", "ReviewID": "R2X0ZMBWC364WJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a fantastic laptop. I have used it for two weeks now, loading up programs, playing games and just kicking it about to see what it can do. It can do a lot ! And I was happily surprised to see it perform adequate if not well in most areas. In turn for each consideration: Is it light and thin - Yes, at 3.74 it is both light thin, certainly lighter than a Macbook Pro (4.25lbs), but not lighter than a Vaio Z or Macbook Air, which are both 3 lbs flat. How is the scree? - A lot of complaints surfaced on the screen calling it horrible and lacking colour. The screen is just fine, full of color and certainly bright. Is it as nice as a Envy 13 or Macbook Pro 13, No, but it's not that far off to call it a deal breaker. People have made too much of this and I get the sense that ASUS has improved their LEDs in this version. The hard drive is slow, no question about it but large enough that if you don't absolutely pack it (75%+ usage), it is fast enough. Also keep in mind that a faster drive will also eat more battery, the conservation of which was important for this design. How is the processor? Very impressed with this little overclocking beast - I see the darn thing running at 2.1 sometimes, even though it's just a 1.3 - could be my imagination but it does overclock to 1.7 for sure. It's fast enough and I have Itunes, Photo Apps, Mail, multiple browsers open and everything still works just fine. The 4 gb of RAM I am sure has a lot to do with this. THEEE best part of the laptop is the video card. Holy Moly - for a machine this cheap, the discrete graphic card gives computers 2x as expensive a run for their money (before taking it all). It is good, a little too good for this machine. It runs games as well as my 512mb 8600M GT on my macbook pro - very impressive. The track pad is okay, not my favorite (yes, well inferior to macbook pros) but honestly, decent enough to use all day and once you get used to it, you'll get the hang of the multi touch. In summary, for $750, it's hard to get a better machine and since I have had a Dell and HP laptop die on me, I gave Asus a try. So far, I could not be happier.", "Date": "March 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "The PERFECT Laptop", "Author": "Kyle Taylor", "ReviewID": "R3UXWTP0GUSGVY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I researched for days before deciding on this laptop.Battery life: 10/10+/-3 hours in High Performance Mode (GeForce G210M graphics)6+ hours in Entertainment Mode (intergrated Intel Graphics)8+ hours in Battery Saving Mode (intergrated Intel Graphics)And the laptop is smart enough to stop charging as soon as it gets to 100% charge. This way it wont overcharge and damage the battery.Graphics: 10/10Prior to testing Portal, I toggled to the GeForce 210 graphics card. Portal plays very well at 720p at maximum settings with AA off. Very impressive for a laptop that is 3.94lbs (yes i weighed it). 98% of the time I'm not playing games, so it nice to be able to save battery until you want to play games.Build: 10/10I bought this because I'm a college student. I needed something powerful and light. The discrete graphics card is perfect for games. It's made with alimunum and feels very sturdy.Features: 9/10Think of the 9/10 as a good thing. So first off the hardware: it's got a webcam, microphone, VGA out, and HDMI out. It doesn't have a DVD-ROM, but that was a tradeoff.If you want the DVD-ROM built-in, buy the UL80-A1, but be warned, the UL80-A1 is heavier, more cheaply built and cost about the same. I just bought an external DVD-ROM.The sound card has the ability to record in Stereo Mix, this was a HUGE plus for me. Stereo Mix record allows you to record streaming audio at any point.The BOIS does mild overclocking and OS virtualization (like running XP inside Windows 7). And you can set it to enable USB bootability.The ONLY reason I gave \"Features\" a 9/10 was because the wifi card isn't recognized in Backtrack 3, which is like Linux for network hackers. But... 99.5% of people probably won't be using for Backtrack 3. BTW it still works for BT3, but I just had to buy a separate network card.Bottom line, it's sturdy, light-weight, very long battery life, and option for high gaming performance.It can record Stereo Mix, has good BIOS options, and all the peripheral connections necessary.I installed an 80GB Intel X-25 SSD. It was an extra $200, but it now boots into Windows in 30 seconds (instead of 1 min. 45 sec.) and is very quick and responsive. Now I have a spare 500GB hard drive.So cruise for hot spots, surf the internet anywhere, do your homework anywhere, and play games anywhere.

I went online searching for this problem and noticed that other people were also having such a problem. Some people were saying that it is normal to have such clicking noise.A week ago I contacted ASUS about this problem and they told me that this is not normal and they will replace it with the new one.

I shopped around for other PC's in stores and online and even borrowed a friends Macbook Pro for a few days to get a feel for it, and ultimately i'm very happy with this little laptop.As a college student I was looking primarily for a light and portable laptop that I could carry around with me everywhere all day. I'm not a big gamer, but I wanted a powerful enough system to run some games if I wanted and needed something powerful enough to multitask with Photoshop. Battery life was also a top priority, as I wanted a truly portable laptop to use inside and outside all day without needing to be tethered or worry about running out of battery.I had it for a little over a month now and the ASUS UL30VT-A1 definitely met all of these criteria, and has continued to exceed what I had expected in a new laptop. I think the truly innovative thing about the Vt is it's versatility. The ability to trade power and graphics with battery longevity instantaneously is an unprecedented feature that i am frankly amazed that no one else had tried before. Amazing idea ASUS.Battery: 10/10 \"the best\"Its amazing to be able to use this all day (im usually away from my place for over 14hours) and not have to worry about running out or needing to stay tethered to an outlet. I don't even bring my charger with me anymore. On integrated graphics I get around 10 hours with wifi, multiple browsers, Word, and a few other programs open. I kinda expected it would be 12 hours under normal use, as all new laptops seem to get 2 hours less then they advertise when using it under normal workloads. With both graphic cards going watching videos and doing normal computing stuff I get around 7 hours. Bottom line, I find myself not having to worry about the battery gauge, it'll last me the day doing whatever I need.Performance: 10/10 \"exceeds my needs\"Now a super long battery life wouldn't be much out of the ordinary-if i was using a tiny, underpowered netbook. What really sets this apart is the fact that it has that kind of batter life while being powerful and light. So far ive been able to multitask with as many programs as I want with no slow down. Normally run multiple windows of Firefox, IE, Word, PP, Outlook, and Photoshop at the same time. Granted this probably isnt that taxing of a load as I haven't played any high power games, but its great for me. I haven't even needed to use the \"turbo\" overclock feature.Graphics: 9/10 \"once again, exceeds my needs\"So not only does this have better battery life than most laptops(mackbook pro included), but has a dedicated graphics card as well! I love the ability to be able to switch on the fly depending on my needs. Most of the time the integrated graphics does fine, itll handle online streaming video(even HD) without a hiccup. With the integrated one on too, things only get better. Pictures and video pop and run smoothly. Once again the graphics capabilities of this laptop exceed my ordinary needs, but i like the extra headroom these options give me. Only real thing is that the screen is a little glossy( well, they all are nowadays it seems) so it can be a little troublesome outside with the sun at my back, and the vertical viewing angle. To me thats now big deal(because the screen is on a hinge you dummy, adjust it) and the horizontal viewing angle is great, much better than my old dell, and makes sharing the screen easy.  The screen does flash on and off when then graphics settings are swithed, but this is expected while video settings are being changed.Construction/physical attributes: 9/10 \"solid, but not quite a Macbook Pro unibody\"Overall I really like it. It's met what I wanted, Its small at 13\" and quite light at around 3.7lbs, and is overall smaller than any of my textbooks even with a case on. Construction is solid: i toss it around alot, carry it in my bag, and have a bad habit of opening it one handed with a flick of the screen, but it has all stayed solid and shown no signs of flex or loose parts. I like the matte-plastic bottom, it has a solid feel. The brushed aluminum top also gives it some nice durability and class, over which ive gotten a few comments on. Even the track pad, on which i've heard alot of complaints about and was a little worried about before using it, has worked well and i even kind prefer it to the flat types. The only complaint is the palm rest. It's glossy plastic which while being structurally solid, feels cheaper than the rest of the materials. Also ive had my palm hit the track-pad a few times while typing; would be better if there was a guard or recessed track pad. While not as cool looking as a full aluminum unibody like the Macbook pro, it's solid and had good constructionAlso its very light and extremely cool. Even after running for hours, the bottom and palm rests barely get warmer than body temperature. Beats all other computers I've used in this regard,and was one of the reasons I choose this over the macbook pro which can get quite hot under heavy use.Overall, I love the versatility and features of this laptop. The ability to majorly change my performance, graphics, and battery settings on the fly lets this laptop doing this that other single ones cannot. The battery life cannot be beat. I also really like Window 7. Boots up in seconds and has most of the cool mac-like features and some extra ones too. The Value is great, and it comes with the best standard warranty ive seen on any laptop. 2 years + one year for ACCIDENTAL DAMAGE. So even I break the darn thing, its under warranty. Bottom line was that I was comparing this with a MacBook Pro. To get a comparably equipped Pro it would cost >$500 to match the the ASUS (4GB ram, 500GB hd, warranty). Even then this was a unique laptop with its unrivaled battery life and adaptability. I decided to go with the ASUS and use the extra $500 to save for a SSD in a year or so and to help pay college expenses. On campus all the \"hip\" kid are trying to get macbooks, but now i've got the real unique laptop at a better value and superior specs. The real cool kids get ASUS.", "Date": "February 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Totally recommend this laptop...absolutely amazing.", "Author": "fewaopi", "ReviewID": "R3KBLLEI8Z2A3H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for about a month now, and seeing the price go up since I bought it makes me love this laptop even more.Laptop is quiet, enough to be in a library and not disturb anyone. My 14\" inch HP was a party animal. The fan was ridiculously loud that it was probably the vuvuzela of laptops. The computer's specifications are pretty solid. Good HD space, great RAM, and CPU. Good speed and power. The battery life is hysteric. It's not 12 hours but I've gotten 10.5 hours, averaging around 9.5 hours on a full charges. This is enough to last me through a whole day's work. It has great design, looks great, same goes with the keyboard. I can play MW2 with anti aliasing off so it's a pretty damn good gaming machine given its size, battery, and specs. I've really enjoyed the gaming qualities on this laptop, mainly because all computers i owned before never had a discrete graphics card but nonetheless, it's a great gaming computer for those who are casual gamers but want to play the latest games. The ASUS is also pretty cool. The side vent lets out a lot of heat and is cool to put on the lap. My previous HP was so hot I probably could've boiled water and it has actually heated my room before.I can go on and on about how wonderful this laptop is but i'll focus on some of the problems people might have with this computer. None of these problems are enough to detract the quality of this laptop.1) Fingerprints - i've read some reviews that complain what a fingerprint laptop this is. Some say it's everywhere on the computer and say it's the worst thing ever. This silver version for me only gets fingertips on the black plastic around the screen. The silver lid doesn't get any fingerprints and if it does, you'd have to spend a couple minutes trying to angle the laptop right just to find it (if you can). So it's not a big fingerprint magnet, just a little around the screen when you're lifting up the screen, nowhere else.2) Touchpad - there were a few complaints here as well, since it wasn't as responsive. It didn't bother me when I first tried it, but when I compared it to my old laptop, the ASUS indeed had more resistance to moving the cursor than my old one. It wasn't a real big deal, i mean, if you're gonna complain about moving a finger just a little more, well....(resistance could be due to me leaving the sticker on top of the touchpad, though i don't think it makes any difference overall). Plus I use a mouse when stationary so I dont really give a hoot.3.) Glossy screen - Yes the screen is glossy and mirror like at times. Does it bother me like crazy? Not the slightest. In fact, it sometimes has uses. For me, it can double as a mirror when the screen turns off when not in use. It's also useful for seeing what's behind you which sometimes is useful. So I wasn't even slightly ticked about the screen. I mean, I can still see what I'm doing without straining.4.) Lack of Optical drive - wait you use an optical drive??!!! just kidding. I haven't used an optical drive in years so this is a nonissue.5.) Bloatware - just decrapify it. Every laptop these days almost always comes with bloatware and ASUS is no exception. Just remove it. If it weren't for the bloatware, this laptop might not have had such a cheap price.5.) Build quality - this is my only source of worry. It took me a while to notice but when I type, I feel as though the keyboard starts to depress and when I press hard enough, it does depress. But when typing normally, I hardly notice it and it feels pretty solid to me. The screen is also not completely solid. It flexes. I'm not sure if this is a bad thing because if it flexes, it can handle some stress but when I lift the screen up, sometimes, I hear a creaking noise like stepping on hardwood floor. I don't know how solid a screen is supposed to be. The screen is really thin so a little flexing is probably expected. It hasn't caused any problems, and I can't imagine this computer suffering just because of build quality so overall, it's solid.Final thoughts: this laptop is great for those who want to a thin-light, long battery life, good (not great) gaming laptop at a very competitive price (got it for 699.99) It handles many tasks very well and no laptop I know offers so much for so little $$$$. In fact, I recommend this laptop for anyone even searching for a computer because it meets many of the basic needs and much more at a low price.", "Date": "August 2, 2010"}, {"Title": "Easily the Best Laptop I've Ever Purchased", "Author": "Jason Barlow \"jase439\"", "ReviewID": "R2PVEQFVMG5VJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is easily the best laptop I've ever purchased.  It is everything it advertises itself to be from the insane battery life (between 10.5 and 11 hrs on my first charge), stylishly thin and featherweight design (~3.8 lbs), beautiful dead-pixel-free LCD, to what is the best \"chicklet\" style keyboard I've ever typed on.  This product is extremely configurable and is easily tailored on the fly to your power consumption/usage needs.  It boots into Windows crazy fast (with FastBoot) and provides nice utilities for pruning out the garbage.  It is not pre-fab'd with lots of bloatware and spam as typical with the major PC vendors which made me exceedingly happy (first laptop whose lifetime didn't begin with format c: /s).The mousepad can take some getting use to at first as the surface is simply dimpled and not depressed into the palm rest.  But after a day or two, I was hooked on this new design (it is worth spending a little time with the touchpad driver configuration as the touch pad sensitivities are marginal out of the box).  My harddisk was a 5400 RPM Seagate drive which exhibited an audible \"clicking\" noise when the drive spun up.  This was my only point of irritation.  I called ASUS and they immediately replaced it with the WD Scorpio Blue WhisperDrive and it's quiet as a stealth bomber.  I believe this is what they are shipping standard on this unit now, but ask the reseller to verify the drive (insist on the newer WD).My customer service experience with ASUS support was top-shelf and given by knowledgeable support staff who genuinely seemed to care that I was happy with my purchase.  They treated me with intelligence and did not farm me off to some third-world call center with people reading from a script.  I could not say the same for this laptop's predecessor, HP.  Best of all, the warranty (which includes accidental damage protection) comes standard.  No additional contracts are necessary.I've owned Sony's, Dell's, HP's, and Micron laptops prior to this.

A laptop that has a long long battery and can still play some games.Pros:- long battery life (I get nearly 11 hours on a single charge with just lightly browsing the web and chatting online)- two graphics card options for the long battery or for playing games- I actually like the ability to be able to change the graphics card on my own rather than have Nvidia doing it on their own (Optimus) so I know which card I am using at which time- ASUS's ability to overclock the processor to 1.73 GHzCons:- bloatware, because there is A LOT (took forever to uninstall it).  I actually found a website that went through all of the programs that come on ASUS's laptops and described them and which are worthy of keeping; which made the uninstall easy- the glare on the screen is pretty annoying, but it isn't horrible.  I've seen worse on other laptops, but I have also seen better.  It is definitely not a deal breaker.- Finally, this is more to do with all laptop companies and not just ASUS, but the day of getting the windows CD/DVD is over which displeases me (I know this doesn't have a DVD Drive but that shouldn't stop them giving the disc)Conclusion:This laptop is definitely worth the price (especially since I got it $100 off the original price).

Typing in that half of the keyboard results in an unsatisfying ringing sound. It's not that big of a deal though.This thing is incredibly sexy. When I bring it to class, it turns heads. I love the brushed metal lid!The battery life is insane. Sometimes I don't even charge it every night. A typical day has me bring this baby to classes, use it constantly in every single one of them, then take it home and use it some more. The Power4Gear mode (ASUS's power management software) I fell in love for battery life is Quiet Office. I changed it around to suit my needs of course, but this is the mode I have this laptop in almost all the time. The other is High Performance. This one is perfect for gaming, or when you just need some more power.If you're looking for numbers I would have to tell you I haven't worked on this thing continuously until it's run out. I use it for a few hours then put it in hibernate, then use it more. It just goes and goes.I am a power user. I run Adobe CS4 applications, game occasionally, and generally use a laptop unlike the average person. When I was reading reviews on this thing, I could not for the life of me find one where the reviewer ran Photoshop or other high powered programs on it. Gaming, sure, that was accounted for, but I am a web/graphic designer and needed something I could do work on in any location.I'm pleased to say that this laptop runs Photoshop and other CS4 applications great. The Core 2 ULV is a beast, really. Coupled with 4gb of ram, I've been run about 15 heavy programs simultaneously (that's not the cap, just the number I happened to have open) and this thing never hiccuped.I've also gamed on it. It runs Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 at native resolution with perfectly playable frame rates. I turned off shadows and some other graphics intensive extras.This thing is very light, convenient, and has the perfect form factor. It NEVER gets hot. When I have it on quiet office mode, I can't even hear then fan. The bottom is completely cool. Even on high performance mode, it's hard to hear even though the fan is running at a higher speed. And the underside still doesn't get hot!I know the new UL laptops with Core iX processors are coming out soon but if you've been looking at this one debating whether to get it or not, GET IT!

The dedicated video card with the ability to switch it automatically or by a simple button is great too.  I don't game but I will be running some CAD type stuff and that should help out a bunch.  The hard drive is a little loud especially noticeable when in a quiet room, and only 5400 rpm.It does feel a bit \"plasticy\".  I think it may be because I am used to a desktop keyboard.  The trackpad is integrated right into the case which is new to me but works great.  The button is one button with two sides and a little stiff but I am hoping that will wear in a bit.  The keyboard is fine, the right shift key is a little small and takes some getting used to.The screen is very bright but does remind me a bit of the old dual scan screens as the angle you look at it must be corrected if you move it around.  The speakers are good too.I have yet to find out how to get this thing to boot in 8 seconds.  It can't even resume in 8 seconds! Also I don't know how to get battery life to 12 hours, maybe on the dimmest mode and just sitting there.

The battery life is amazing; I just finished a 7 hour development session on battery and still have 15% left.  The laptop is very lightweight which is really important to me as I need to carry around two laptops.  I have used it to play a couple of games (Modern Warfare 2 and Company of Heroes) and it has played them with moderate framerates (30-40 fps) although I did have to reduce settings.  I have found the trackpad to be OK; not great but OK. I certainly don't have the issues others have mentioned.  The trackpad buttons are pretty hard to click; I mainly use the trackpad  (double tap, etc) itself and avoid the buttons.My biggest con has been the build quality, it is less than it should be.  My original keyboard had a lot of flex on the left side and some keys would make a \"jingle\" noise when pressed.  Everything worked fine but the jingle noise drove me crazy because I kept thinking something was broken.  I called ASUS support and they offered to send me a replacement keyboard.  I received it within a week and installed it myself.  The new keyboard eliminated the flex and the annoying jingle noises.  Kudos to ASUS for the quick and free replacement but if they have good keyboards available they really should have made sure that the notebooks shipped with them in the first place.Another con would be more of a warning to buyers that understanding the Turbo, GPU, and power management settings is not for beginners.  If you are experienced with computers and Windows PC/laptops the settings are easy to use and will make sense.  However beginners might not understand all the technical details with this laptop, like that the laptop can't switch GPUs if there are still some processes running using the other GPU.  A user who doesn't understand this might get only 4-5 hours of battery life even on \"Battery Savings\" mode and wonder what is going on.All and all though this has been a fantastic laptop for me and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something much more powerful than a netbook that is also lightweight and has long battery life.

After seeing the display on it, I couldn't figure out myself why this notebook got such rave reviews, but he sold it to me at a very good price, so I was not too upset. Well, after tinkering a little bit, I figured out the problem--an optional update from Windows replaces the display drivers (the Nvidia driver and the Intel driver) with its own flimsy driver, and there you have it, a horrible display with everything stretched, and NOTHING seems to work right when the original Asus display drivers aren't properly installed. So I re-installed the display drivers from the drivers CD that came with the laptop, and voil\u00e0, an absolutely gorgeous screen, gorgeous everything--even the pointer seems to work better! Now I know why everybody loves this laptop--their display drivers (both the Nvidia and the Intel chip set) are both working as they should. If you find yourself disappointed, try re-installing the display drivers before you give up.BTW, installing the correct display drivers also SIGNIFICANTLY increases battery life! The moral of the story is: not every Windows update is a good one--pay attention to your Windows updates!  They can give your notebook a Dr. Jekyl/Mr. Hyde personality!

The ULV cpu keeps the power consumption low while the Nvidia switchable graphics card and cpu overclocking allows for some hardcore gaming.I have only noticed a significant heat increase when playing graphic intense games, but this is to be expected because the chassis is so compact. The touch pad does take some time to get use to because it isn't smooth like other touch pads. When it's brand new, you'll notice a lot of grip between your fingers and the pad. But once it gets a bit oily from the oil on your fingers, it gets much easier to use.

When in the Windows environment, shortcut keys makes switching batteries modes easy, including the Nvidia dedicated chip switch on/off to the lower power-hungry system video chip.  This is a fast system, I didn't have to do any annoying uninstalls and it is humming along.  It is not bloaded like other new typical PCs and worth the ~700 street price.  I havent mailed in my warranty card yet but Asus is supposed to provide extra warranty after I do that, so I'm protected by 2 years total.  Which is great.Cons:  The touchpad is poor.  It is a multitouch pad, but the surface needs improvement to allow gliding of the fingers better.  The surface is studded with tiny bumps, and it is virtually impossible to use it without some sort of overcoat/skin as such, you should leave the default sticker film on the touchpad.  I bought the Nintendo DSi XL Screen Protective Filter, and applied the film protector used for the DSi's touchpad on the touchpad for this PC, and it is smooth and working like a charm.Also, the weight is not heavy, but it is NOT a ultra-portable.  I've been spoiled by my Lenovo X300/X200 weights.In the end, well done Asus.  Highly recommended.  If you are looking for a ready-to-go, powerful laptop in a retail setting (i.e. you dont want to wait for 2-3 weeks for a custom built one), then this is one of the top choices on Amazon!", "Date": "August 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great light weight machine with a for real long lasting battery!", "Author": "Susan Brown", "ReviewID": "R1V0HWZM71599E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works fast, the battery is great, and lasts a full day.

Yes, the viewing angle isn't ideal on this computer for multiple viewers, but it is pretty bright and I've been able to use it outside just fine. Indoors, I don't have problems with the viewing angle. The trackpad does not have all the gestures of a Mac, but it has the basic scrolling up/down & left/right. The buttons at the bottom are okay, but a left click is just a single tap and a right click is a three finger tap. I mainly use my computer for web browsing and MS Office.Asus is a bit confusing with their model numbers, so be careful when comparing models. This computer comes with bluetooth, 2 yrs warranty, and (most importantly) 512 MB Nivida graphics. Amazon has a cheaper version of this computer out there, but you usually don't get the 2 yr warranty or the graphics chip, which are both well worth it. Asus just release u30Jc-1a which has a better Intel chip (i3) and DVD drive, but it is about 1 pound heavier and will cost you a bit more.Pros: (1) size and weight - it's great. (2) value: a 500GB HD, 2 year warranty, 1.3GHz duo-core & 512MB Nivida graphic card, etc. (3) Internet, youtube, hulu, etc. work very well with this computer. Pcmag did a nice comparison of performance tests on the UL50VF-A1, which is essentially this computer with a CD-ROM [...]. (4) comfortable, full-sized keyboard.(5) HDMI output. (6) It's really nice to be able to switch graphics/performance modes without shutting down the machine.Cons: (1) power cord (yes, it is small, hurray!) but mine is a 3 prong plug grounded plug. Yes, having the ground is nice in some situations, but mostly, its an annoyance. Also, my power cord comes unplugged a lot due to its location. (2) Heat - this is a laptop which has a \"cool palm rest\" but the bottom of the unit gets hot when sitting on my lap. It's not unbearable, but its warmer than my last two computers have been. (3) Win 7 - it would be nice to have the professional edition installed, since you need this version for XP compatible mode. The good news is that the upgrade is pretty simple, but will cost you a few more bucks. (4) No DVD-Drive (but hey, that's why its so light! And really, most of us don't use the drive that often).

The UL30VT-A1 really does an amazing job at both. The graphics card is good enough for casual gamers, and the switchable graphics is nice because the battery life on this thing rocks! Has the best power management options I've seen. HD video is handled very well, although the native resolution isn't enough to do 1080p and I've yet to try it hooked up to a larger screen. Keyboard is great and feels very spacious.On the negatives, there are a few. The biggest is the lack of a matte screen. Glossy is the worst thing that has happened to monitors lately, and the screen would really benefit from a matte option. It would really benefit from separate mouse buttons instead of the bar, and placement on the outer edge (like on the eee 1000h line) would make it much easier to use. The last thing in the cons is that the default settings and apps are terrible. I appreciate the inclusion of the ASUS power management stuff, as well as the ASUS specific utilities that don't run in the background, but they seemed to go a little overboard. Changing power modes changes the wallpaper until you figure out how to turn it off. That was _terrible_. Too many useless junk apps and games, had to spend a half hour cleaning off.Overall this is an excellent machine. Plenty of RAM, windows 7 works very well on it, even in powersaving mode. Plenty of disk space, although I'm not sure how I feel about them picking my partition scheme for me (150GB for system, rest on data). It also looks great, aside from the crap glossy part.

I'll keep it brief.The Pros:- Battery Life is as good as advertised. I get ten hours out of this thing easily listening to music, downloading over a wireless network and word processing. Simply and amazing battery/processor combination.- This computer is not just an energy sipper, though. It has enough graphics horsepower to run starcraft 2 on medium at 30 FPS without overclocking.- Pretty large HDD, even if it is only spinning at 5400 RPM.- Aesthetics: It's brushed aluminum cover, while not really solid feeling (Thin sheet of aluminum), makes it look pretty snazzy. Black chicklet keyboard set in the silver stock looks very reminiscent of a macbook pro. On a side note, it's pretty easy to buy a backlit keyboard and install it into the UL30VT so you can type in the dark.The Cons:- Glossy screen. I hate glossy screens, but this one seems to be particularly atrocious. Not only do reflections distract all the time, but the viewing angle of the actual LCD is pretty bad, too. Takes a lot of adjusting and fine tuning to get a movie to look good. Forget about showing a bunch of friends a video.- Built in webcam is poor as well.

It's light enough to carry to class every day, it's big enough to comfortably watch movies and game, and the battery life is nothing short of amazing! On a full charge, I can use this laptop for a solid 8 hours with nearly full brightness, wireless enabled, and the integrated video. I'm sure I could squeeze another hour out of it with lower brightness and no wireless, but why bother?My only complaint is the touch pad. I like the \"cheese-grater\" style of touch pad, but this one is just a little too touchy. If I'm doing a lot of typing, I have to disable the touch pad to save my sanity. Those with perfect typing posture might not have this problem.This my 2nd Asus laptop (first was my Eee), and this one replaced my HP TX1000. The UL30 is better in almost every possible way. It stays reasonably cool while playing games, doesn't set my pants on fire, and has a very generously-sized keyboard, and cost about half as much as my tablet. This is the first laptop I've had with a chiclet-style keyboard, and I'm a big fan.I shopped for months before buying the UL30Vt, and not once did I find such an awesome feature set at anywhere NEAR this price.Pros:- This and light- Smart Logon is cool, works pretty well.- Quick-boot OS is handy, even if it can't connect to a WPA2-Enterprise network.- Huge 500GB HDD- Switch video cards on the fly! W00t!- Amazing battery life (8+ hours of real-world usage).- Nice aluminum top deck.Cons:- So-so touch pad, hard to get sensitivity dialed in.- Keyboard deck is glossy and gets covered with fingerprints easily. It's hard to avoid this from any laptop maker, though.[NOTE TO MANUFACTURERS: GLOSSY SURFACES SUCK!

Battery life is superb although not close to the advertised 12 hours. I'm getting 6-8 actual but that's with Turbo33 turned on and brightness jacked up to the max.As has been said in many of the reviews, the only real drawback is the screen. The horizontal viewing angle isn't very forgiving, but I knew that going in and considering everything else I'm getting for the price I'm very satisfied.For those of you concerned about the speed, you'll be pleasantly surprised. The speed of the Front-Side Bus and RAM really make up for the low clock speed of the processor. I've found overall it's snappy and doesn't get bogged down when multitasking.If amazon allowed it, I'd give this 4.5 stars with the only drawback being the viewing angle of the screen.", "Date": "July 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very good laptop with good price", "Author": "Zhenguo", "ReviewID": "R2PWX4T6KX4N0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The ASUS UL30vt-A1 is an excellent laptop and good price.

I've had this laptop for about a month and so far have only installed VPN and Winamp. Shutdown and initial load from hibernation isn't too great but not unreasonable. I haven't used Windows 7 too extensively so not sure if this where that lag is coming from. Since I don't have an optical drive included with this model, I catch myself thinking about how it would be great to play some CDs (nevermind that I used my old laptop's optical drive maybe 5x in it's entire 4 year life). It had some software that I didn't care for but not annoying enough that I felt like I had to wipe the laptop OS immediately. I agree with some of the other comments that the partitioned C: drive for programs is a little excessive at over 100 gigs.Despite the little complaints, my experience so far has been positive and I would recommend this laptop.

The WD hard drive that it comes with has an annoying clicking sound. I have never noticed this sound on any other laptops I've used before, which worries me.2. Customer service at Asus... 1 star at most. I was on hold for no less than 45 minutes and was given misleading information and even \"threatened!!!\".If you are interested, the story:I called Asus to have my hard drive replaced because of the strange clicking sounds it made. The customer service rep advised me to use an \"advance replacement\" method to speed up the process. The advance method requires the owner to replace the hard drive themselves, and then send in the defective part. Sounds great right!?4 days later wondering where my replacement hard drive was I called Asus again. I was told this time that the \"return shipping is NOT covered!!\". I explained that the first customer rep mentioned that I would receive a shipping label via email but never received one. They not only refused to cover the return shipping, I was rudely asked \"read the advance replacement form\" again, and was threatened to be charged for the new hard drive if the defective part was not sent back.Sure I understand that they want to charge me for the part if I don't send it back, but the issue is I was never informed (included the form I signed) that shipping is only covered ONE WAY.So 2 year warranty... 1 year accidental damage... \"free two-way standard shipping\"... SOUNDS GREAT right? But, not included unless you send the entire laptop to them.

I was deciding between this and a much more expensive Lenovo model and decided to go for less money and more battery power.I've had the laptop for about a week and keep encountering problems. I'm disappointed - usually when something has reviews this great I tend to like it a lot. But I keep encountering glitches, and fresh out of the box! Here are some of the problems I've encountered:* Express Gate - this is a nice feature, you can boot up fast and use basic utilities. BUT, the screen resolution is set wrong, so the screen is stretched. I've searched user forums and there doesn't appear to be a solution that doesn't involve hacking into linux.* Express Gate skype - the microphone works fine when I access skype using the regular operating system, but it doesn't work in express gate. Again I searched user forums and found that no one seems to have a solid fix for this. How could the manufacturer ship these computers with skype installed in express gate but without the microphone working???? That makes skype useless! Apparently it works with a microphone plugged in (so I have read on the forums) but not with the built-in microphone.* Some documentation about how to utilize the power to get maximum battery life or performance would be nice. I haven't dug around the internet for this yet but will soon. When I first charged the computer and then unplugged it, it said less than 5 hours of battery. Fresh from the box! When it's advertised as 11-12! I had to search online to find out how to change settings to get it up to about 8.I've had a number of other glitches too just with things working... but the express gate stuff is a real disappointment.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "no dvd player", "Author": "Ricky Layong", "ReviewID": "R1VKNUKG157E8I", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hate this product because there is no dvd player with this model.
