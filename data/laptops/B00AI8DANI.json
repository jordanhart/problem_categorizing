Its somewhat big and heavy, but it is a sturdy, well built machine and that's best for me. I'm an architect so I will be doing a lot of CAD and 3D work, and the Nvidia Quadro seems to perform very well, as expected since it's supposed to be optimized for this type of applications. Great price when compared to other mobile workstations from Dell, HP, and others. I will probably install additional RAM and maybe an SSD drive in the future.", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Low end model, low resolution display, beware keyboards are a bit fragile", "Author": "Dave C", "ReviewID": "R14AANK4U5IZ8Q", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This machine arrived properly packed, but as soon as I opened the lid, the backslash / pipe key fell out, it was totally loose. I figured I would deal with returning it later as I wanted to verify Linux would run cleanly, which it does (Ubuntu 13.10 booted from DVD-R).I had a much bigger issue with it: I had wanted one with a 1920x1080 display and a real graphics chip, not the Intel all-in-1 and a 1600x900 display of this model. Like a car, laptops come with a bewidlering variety of options within a single model name like W530. ThinkPads (since the IBM days) have a build code which specifies exactly how the machine is configured. I was apparently careless with the build code, the one I wanted is 24384CU and this is 24384KU. I've been burned by this once before in the late 90's, when IBM made the codes for 2 very different models very similar. Amazon unhelpfully puts this information below the fold and having surfed and looked at specs until I couldn't see straight, I decided on a model, searched and clicked, and Amazon's search must have broken the build code into numeric and alpha parts and offered up the wrong one. I just found the last CU on Amazon and bought it, and the KU with its broken key is going back.Every seller knows the display is a major part of the spec, the 1920x1080 display adds $200+ to the price, and every one seemingly tries to obfuscate the display resolution. I thought I was getting a bargain on new-old stock (the W540 has been out for a while) and instead I was paying full list for new-old stock.If you're gonna mostly use it docked, 1600x900 might float your boat, but I use my machine as-is on-site at clients' premises for work in the software / internet business, and I need the resolution. That does not detract from it being a ThinkPad, the case and engineering are the same as my 3.5+ year old W510 (with beautiful 1920x1080 AMOLED screen) on which I am typing this. Between work, personal use and buying them for the wife for college, I have owned 17 ThinkPads over the last 20 years, the W530 will make it 18, and I think that states my opinion on the product line. Lenovo has in general kept up IBM's legendary quality. When I have managed IT in the past, I have had a ThinkPad-only policy, they are durable and easy to support and maintain.I've seen people complaining about the keyboard quality on the W540, and I concur it's not as good as the older one I have, but having had hands on one, I feel pretty good about having ordered a(nother) W530 because it types so nicely. I use my ThinkPads very hard and I have replaced a number of keyboards, including one on my W510, which is still in excellent condition and going to a friend. ThinkPad parts are affordable and easy to install.A key feature of the W5x0 series rarely found outside huge workstation models is 4 DIMM slots, these come with 8GB and two free slots which is handy.", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Rip off", "Author": "Eric A. Hardt \"Eric Hardt\"", "ReviewID": "R1DQNF82H08X4E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I am sad to write a negative review for one of my favorite brands. If you have a docking station and numerous AC power adapters because they were so nicely interchangeable, then you are up for a surprise. This product needs it's own power supply and docking station. If you rely on the docking station and need a spare power supply, then this product easily becomes $300 more expensive!I do understand the need for a larger power supply due to the quad processor, but I do not understand why this would also require different accessories for this laptop.Please understand that I am not just rating the W530 laptop itself, but rather the laptop compatibility with existing accessories, which I believe is an important criteria.Hopefully Lenovo will address those issues before another brand becomes my favorite.", "Date": "January 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "screen is broken", "Author": "linyuanjia", "ReviewID": "R3LAKP46TKJRKO", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "when i  open it at first time. i found the screen is flashing , i'm sure something in the screen is broken. i feel disappointed.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "i add a 120g m5p ssd", "Author": "David", "ReviewID": "R14UFH35EGGHQZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i added a 120g m5p ssd from dvd bay. i formated the old system and reinstall win7 system.i encountered one time system freeze since today, and then i upgraded intel chip driver(can bus driver missing after the system freeze).so far so good. i use many thinkpad laptops but i still cannot get used to the keyboard.

At 13 months I started having issues - USB 3's and VGA stopped working, crash dumping for no reason, built in mouse freezes constantly, and ever slower startup.I tried system restore using the built in recovery, but it won't launch. Called Lenovo and they won't provide any assistance since warranty has expired; all they offer is to PURCHASE recovery disks. When I asked to speak with a manager I was denied for not having a current warranty.While the computer worked well it was nice, but definitely not worth the money long-term.
