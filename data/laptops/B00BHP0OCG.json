{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great HW, Opinion will Depend on Windows 8", "Author": "James Igoe", "ReviewID": "R3KUH7C17KF642", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love the hardware, and have no major issues.  Here is my take: - The laptop has great flexibility, but I use a sleeve to protect the keyboard when rotated as a tablet.  Otherwise, the laptop and display positions are great, and in fact, these are how I typically use the tablet. - Looks great. - I have read complaints about the trackball, but this has been my favorite one so far. - No issues with responsiveness, but Windows 8 requires certain motions that I get different responses from, but I have only been using Windows 8 for 2 days, so I chalk it up to training on Windows itself. - Honestly, very fast, very responsive.  No hangs in 2 days of intensive use. - Battery seems fine, and certainly more than 5, and possibly up to 8 hours continuous use. - Thought it might have had network issue, but our dual band router was behaving flaky, but I updated the network driver to the latest from Lenovo, and no issues since. - Paid $2000 from Lenovo directly, including seperate DVD burner ($80) and MS Office Pro ($350).  Also, separately bought sleeve from Amazon site ($30), as well as mice (bought 2 to try, for spouse and self, $70) - No backlit keyboard, which is a drawback. - Really enjoying Windows 8, and am preferring the tablet UI, even from the laptop mode.  Got up to speed quickly using some online resources.  Find some app, even MS's are gorgous and useful - Very cool in use, and do not expect to need a cooling base, but will get a laptop base for spouse to use while reclining.", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Computer - Light Weight and Fast - Great Workmanship", "Author": "Paul Nevill", "ReviewID": "RCCREQ8H7SQYV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Windows 8 was tough but the computer is worth learning the new format.  It is one of the top 5 ultra books in my opinion.  I looked at most of them some had more USBs and additional input features, but the workmanship on this computer like the Think Pads shows it will hold up for years.  It is a bit pricey but over time it pays for itself when the computer is built well.  You can add a second hard drive which is very cool (check youtube).
