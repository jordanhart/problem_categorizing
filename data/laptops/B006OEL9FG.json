{"Reviews": [{"Title": "GREAT for what I need", "Author": "Good Stuff", "ReviewID": "R27YPUX2862UFS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I saw some of the reviews on here and thought I would add my 2 cents.  I bought this computer at Office Depot for 350 dollars (sorry amazon ... love your prices usually but not this time) For the price and specs this is an excellent computer.  If you are looking for a computer that does more than surf the web and homework this is NOT the computer for you so dont leave comments saying that this computer is bad because the graphics are not great ... they aren't supposed to be great and those are not productive comments.  If you ARE looking for a comp for school (as I was looking for) this is an excellent choice with great specs and a great price.  As per some of the other comments, I have had no problems connecting to the internet and if you are looking for a bigger laptop with a key pad this is not the computer you should have bought in the first place.  Battery life a great (in my opinion, although I have not pushed it yet to see if it goes past 3+ hours).  I agree that the arrow keys are a little annoying but then again my last two laptops were Toshiba Satellites and I was used those types of keyboards for a while.  I'll get used to it.  Overall exactly what I thought I was getting and works exactly for what I want; surfing and reviewing/writing documents.", "Date": "February 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for what it is - but poor out-of-box experience", "Author": "Peter W. Van Derpas \"Peter van der Pas\"", "ReviewID": "RMNM2U4CNPBAF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop for about $300 after $50 rebate, and for the price it is a very good deal with one exception.  The wifi/bluetooth adaptor does not work if you are anywhere more than a few feet from the wifi router.  Web browsing is slow, drops connection or operates at limited capacity if you move away from the wifi router.  I spent 4 hours e-mailing back and forth to HP support in India without a solution.  The support is efficient and polite, but was unable to resolve the issue.  Finally I discovered a work-around that provides good wifi connectivity, however, I do not consider it a fix because it involves disabling power saving features of this laptop.  To find the solution search for \"Wireless issues on HP2000-US with Atheros AR9485\" and read the posts on HP's support discussion site.What I did to fix the problem (I now get amazing wifi coverage throughout the house):Simply go into device manager, select Network Adapters, select Atheros AR9485..., select Advanced - Power Save Mode turn  to \"off\"Next under Control Panel, select Hardware and Sound, Under Power Options select Change Battery Settings, Select \"change plan settings\" set both battery and plugged in to \"Maximum Performance.\"I would like to see HP actually fix the problem so that I could get better battery life, but for now this will do.  Aside from this wifi issue the laptop provides decent performance.  The screen is very sharp and bright.  It has sufficient disk capacity and memory can be expanded if you want to juice performance in running multiple aps or large graphics.  Overall a great laptop for the price.  I just wish I had the 4 hours I spent figuring this out back.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "HP 2000-410US", "Author": "E.

The Pentium CPU is a much better and faster CPU then the AMD E Series in this price class.  Its speakers o.k. (they certainly are not Beats Audio quality) and the touch pad can be touchy, but those are my only complaints.  I have seen other reviews saying they have had overheating issues, but mine has been fine thus far.

Doyle", "ReviewID": "R2Z5C2717LK7BT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this computer a year ago (late July 2012) with graduation money, and it is the worst purchase I have ever made. Unfortunately I don't have money for a new laptop or I'd get rid of this one immediately.I had forgotten about it until I skimmed the reviews on the 350us, but this computer had serious wifi issues out of the box and if you don't know what you're doing, you could have issues forever. The problem was that the wifi would cut out when I unplugged the laptop. It turns out that whatever dingus programmed these laptops thought it'd be a good idea to put wifi on low priority for energy-usage when the computer is unplugged, so you have to go in to the power settings and change the router's priority. It took me WAY too long to figure that out. It shouldn't even be an issue that arises in the first place, if you ask me.This computer is terrible. It temporarily freezes when I open up the iTunes Store because it's SO MUCH WORK good god. I only have one game on this laptop (MapleStory) and I can't play it very often because when I do it takes up 50% of this terrible computer's CPU and causes thermal shutdowns, something that I had never even knew existed before this computer.Basically, this computer brand new ran worse than my 4-year-old Toshiba laptop, and I think that says something about the quality. Needless to say, I'm never wasting my money on an HP computer ever again. The only good thing about it was I got it for less than $150 bucks.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheaper than the HP Site", "Author": "Linda", "ReviewID": "R2CY4CJ577M3OY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I compared the price on the HP site and it was about fifty dollars cheaper hear, and it would have taken about a week longer to get it. I have had the computer for a couple days.  At first it seemed a little slow but after doing all the updates it is doing fine.  Loads fast.

I was hoping for a great laptop but this isn't it. Firstly let me say it performs well in its regular functions, quick start-ups etc. However when we tried to watch a video or even listen to audio its so low sometimes its high but it has to be an extremely high quality video or audio. So you'll need to invest in external speakers. Then we started to see intermittent drops in the wifi even if we are in the very room the router is in. I am unable to use the laptop in the front rooms of the house because of this. Sometimes it works for a long time before disconnecting. Sometimes you just have to move the laptop to lose connection. This is a laptop for the person who really doesn't care about the audio or the wifi or for a low budget buy for kids.", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006OEL9FG"}}
