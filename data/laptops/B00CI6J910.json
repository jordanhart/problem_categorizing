I have been using it consistently since receiving it and it first of all is in good condition. I have a HP Netbook I purchased new and have been using for two years now and it's a bit beat up. This HP Elitebook appears to have been hardly used. I am very happy with the performance and the condition of my HP Elitebook 8440p. I must inform you that my HP Netbook was pretty slow and it took a moderate amount of time to get work done, Not with the HP Elitebook 8440p, it's Fast. I am saving time and money with my HP Elitebook 8440p . I love it, I would reccommend anyone to buy it.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Please note* - Laptop will have minor scratches / imperfections on the top LCD lid cover, palm rest, or keyboard area.
