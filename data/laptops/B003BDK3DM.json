It packs more than enough power to get your work done.  The video card doesn't allow for much game-play, but it is not a gaming laptop.  For everything you get inside, the price is more than fair.  Shop around to look for a deal, I have seen them go for as little as $399.  I would gladly recommend this computer to anyone in the market for a new laptop.", "Date": "March 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome for the price!", "Author": "D.

This computer packs a great processor, 4GB of ram, a 320GB hard drive, Windows 7 home premium, wireless and a beautiful screen you can't go wrong.It isn't the sleekest computer on the market, but you won't find anything as powerful near the price.You can't go wrong with this laptop.", "Date": "May 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "T4400 Laptop", "Author": "Orellana", "ReviewID": "R3KAAZBBPEI3LR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I expected a camera which was not included in this model, the quality of the screen colors is not very sharp as well as the letters when you write any thing even if its with capital letters, the colors on every image are definitely not as sharp as my first laptop which it was a Toshiba as well !!!!", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheaply built", "Author": "Annie", "ReviewID": "R2TZ9B7JHARMUV", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I admit I have not been the most careful with this laptop, and I need to carry it around a lot, which I do not recommend if you need a highly mobile laptop. It is very easily damaged. Right now there are scuffs all over the laptop because it shows very easily. There is litereally a square of white marks where the screen hits the keyboard when it closes and there is a giant white spot on the touchpad just from clicking with it. The left clicker has been broken since the day I got this computer, the charger has stopped working and I had to get a new one twice in a 2 year period, the dvd cover fell off, the internet has been slowly deteriorating, as I used to get 5 bars in my room and now I get no reception (This is not the internet provider, because my roommates and iPod still have the same reception, and I am experiencing lower reception everywhere). Also, once I was using the laptop and I closed it and there was a large crack, and one of the hinges had fallen off. The battery life is AWFUL. It used to be just annoying, but by now it lasts me maybe 45 minutes on lowest brightness possible. The speakers are really quiet as well.The actual computer runs well-it is fast enough for what I need and I have had no problems running programs (I am not a hardcore gamer by any means, just everyday usage). But like I said, the laptop is built cheaply.", "Date": "October 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "Horrible", "Author": "Frederick", "ReviewID": "R3LM75XOZ5DBSF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this laptop in the January of 2010. A few months after I got it, the touchpad began to wear down, which has resulted in a huge and very unsightly white spot in the middle of it. The left clicker also has a black spot worn into it, as if a Sharpie was used to draw on it. The spots on both have grown over time. Another issue I had with the left clicker was sticking and sometimes not working.I had many problems in regards to performance, and I often found my laptop not being able to run some programs, and while it's not a gaming computer by any means, it couldn't run even low-performance games very well.Lastly, the hinge broke after about a year and every time I opened the laptop, there was a loud clicking noise and the top of the laptop would be crooked and coming loose. Just an hour ago, it completely broke and the screen is now barely hanging on.I've decided that I would rather just buy a new laptop than get this one fixed. This laptop is not worth your time.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not a powerhouse, but certainly not bad", "Author": "Mickey M.", "ReviewID": "R3NE33VI6UB1P6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this computer a bit over a year ago, and for the most part it works great. I use this computer a lot for school and in my free time quite a lot, and it can handle most minor and commonplace things without any problems. The one way I feel that this computer falls short of is the lack of a decent graphics card. It has trouble playing any games, even some that have been out for over 4 years. I don't really mind it all too much, but it tends to be a bit of a hassle in the long run.So yeah, for anything other than games, this computer certainly isnt a bad choice.", "Date": "September 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good purchase", "Author": "NJW \"Ney\"", "ReviewID": "RG6N6NVTD5UCD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work mostly with excel, so I bought this machine since it has the numerical keypad on it.

Arthur", "ReviewID": "R2H4WHWG15PHL2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought one of these for $399 at Best Buy.  Trouble began almost immediately.  There is something wrong with the mouse; with an external cordless mouse the picture drops back to the desktop from time to time.  No one seems able (including Toshiba) to explain the problem.  Now the touch pad won't work when enabled.  Moreover, the rather loud fan pops on and off at 30 second to one minute intervals.  Buyer beware.  I can't return the laptop because Best Buy guarantees such computers for only two weeks.  Less than a month into the Toshiba, and I'm stuck.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "easyily broken", "Author": "jevon", "ReviewID": "R1UYVCSA9W1GQY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i was carring this and i accidently droped it andt the cornor broke off. the first time i got this laptop you could visibly pull the screen edge off. this laptop scratches easy and is made with cheap plastic and not to mension its low graphics card.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Sticky Mouse", "Author": "K.
