To my disappointment, this model has BIG TIME wifi issues. The wifi gets disconnected way too often. It works fine when I'm 1-2 feet away from router, but in the library and other places, there is very less and slow coverage. Whereas, other laptops and macbooks work great at the same place. Additionally, during silent times, the fan kicks off so loud that it feels like the laptop is about to take off. O/w it is a very nice machine. SONY PLEASE FIX THESE GLITCHES! IT IS HIGH TIME AND YOU'RE LOOSING THE BATTLE.", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great lightweight laptop with a few fixable problems.", "Author": "Brien P Miller", "ReviewID": "R253RRNQOJJEK8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "**If you're having problems with Wifi connection and mousepad/keyboard use, please read on.**After being burned by HP and Dell, i decided to switch brands again for Sony or Samsung. Sony had the best selection for what I was looking for, a decently powered laptop that was still lightweight.This model laptop, SVF14A16CXS, was perfect for what I was looking for.After having the laptop for about a month it seems to be performing very well. It starts up incredibly fast compared to my old laptops, I'm assuming because of the internal memory that is sectioned off for quick start ups. Windows 8 took some getting used to, but a touchscreen helps the initial transition from Windows 7. The touchscreen is also incredibly accurate, making me wish I had spring for the Sony laptop that flips down to a tablet, but that's not something I need anyway. I do wish it had more than 2 USB ports, since I can fill 2 ports quickly, but it hasn't yet become a huge problem.I did have a few problems in the first few months while setting up the laptop. Others have complained about these problems, but I have found the solution to make this an excellent laptop. Both of these problems were easily fixed by contacting Sony's warranty help phone number and allowing them to connect to my computer over the internet to fix the problem.Problem 1) After downloading and installing a few windows updates (before the 8.1 update, however) the keyboard would restart. Upon restart, the keyboard and mouse no longer worked outside of safe mode. Reinstalling drivers did not help. It was not as Sony update, as I initially thought. After calling Sony I was told by the technician that Kapersky Antivirus, the antivirus program preinstalled on the laptop for a 30 day trial period, was to blame. Uninstalling Kapersky was one of the first things I did, and in doing so it apparently changed some settings and deleted a few permissions. I don't know how to keep it from doing this. However, a Sony warranty technician was able to fix it in a few short minutes by connecting to my laptop.Problem 2) The Wifi connection drops or disconnects frequently, even when closeby to the router. It will also disconnect when simply changing rooms inside home. This is the complaint I heard most about this laptop, but decided to try it anyway. After calling Sony's warranty help line again someone was able to fix it by increasing the tolerable data threshold on the laptop and changing a few router settings.The fix was quick and I have not had any problems since.I deducted 1 star because of these initial laptop breaking problems, although they were fixed with a few phone calls. Also, the battery on the laptop isn't terrible, but it isn't great either. Applications such as game or working the laptop hard will drain the battery incredibly quickly. This, I assume, is a tradeoff to receive such a lightweight and slim laptop. If you're planning on being away from an outlet, I recommend closing unneeded applications or preventing them from opening on startup automatically.In conclusion, this really is an excellent laptop. Responsive touchscreen, great amount of power for mid level games (WoW and Civilization V), beautiful backlit keyboard and mousepad, HDMI port and 2 USB ports, and quick startup and shut down. While it did have a few problems in the first month, all of these problems were fixed by contacting Sony and cashing in the 1 year limited warranty it comes with.I definitely recommend this laptop.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worse than a Dell!", "Author": "D. Coppola", "ReviewID": "R6XKA8FV7KNTP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I switched from Dell to Sony because I thought I would be getting a better quality computer.  Unfortunately I hadn't come across all of the wifi issues people have with these Sony Fit laptops because I would never have bought it.  I can be five feet away from the wireless router and it will drop the signal.  It's terrible.  Then today, my touchpad went on the fritz, and Sony Support told me the only option was to ship the computer in for service.  Who ships computers in these days?  I'm able to use it, with an external mouse, so I am not going to just part ways because they have no service option that is local (not even the Sony store where I bought it - which mind you, assured me I could bring it there for service if there was a problem).  I can replace the touchpad myself, but Sony refuses to ship one to me - they say it 'goes against their service protocol\".  It's unfortunate that I spent $1050 for a computer that ended up lasting six months, but Sony would rather lose a customer than ship me a 22$ part that I was willing to pay for.", "Date": "April 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "bad", "Author": "Karolina Kozielska", "ReviewID": "R11OCAFX7LLZBD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I regret I bought this laptop. So may things work wrong. Wifi disconnects so often than sometimes I have to connect it few times an hour. Touchpod doesn't work well as well, usualy have to press few times to open what I want. My old HP was much better.What is funny, just after opening Vaio for the first time, I got the notification that I already have 333 errors in the computer which make the computer work slow and if I wanna fix it, I have to buy special program. Are they normal? I spent more than a 1000$ for that piece of crap and they do that to a new laptop? No way. It's slow, so many times it's just suspended and websites don't respond. Few times Windows was completely not working, even restart didn't work. Maybe I just had a bad luck with Vaio, but I WON\"T recommend it to anybody, Invest your money somewhere else.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Seriously?!", "Author": "Sara Ayala", "ReviewID": "RTKT56QQONBEU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "After having struggled with a terrible HP for 3 years I decided to splurge and buy a new computer that I would want to keep till I could no longer use it. At first I went with Apple and their Macbook Pro, I had always wanted one but I couldn't use it on the fact that it had no CD drive (I'm a nursing student) and it wouldn't install Adobe. I decided to look around at my options and I found this Sony that had all the guts of the Macbook and it was pink! I ordered it and now I absolutely can't stand it, except for the keyboard and color. It is so slow to connect to my Wi-Fi while my other products (Note 3, iPad mini) connect just fine. I can't log on to anything without it telling me \"no page to display\" or it just keeps spinning like it's trying to find a connection.I WILL be RETURNING this to Amazon, and looking elsewhere.
