{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome Laptop!", "Author": "Groovin' guy \"music historian\"", "ReviewID": "R25BZLJTW8SXMH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am amazed by this laptop computer.  It is a powerful laptop as it has as much RAM and hard disk space as my desktops do!  It can do many things using the windows 8.1 (64 bit) operating system and it is beautiful to look at as well.My experience with this computer is as follows:I followed the quick start guide and I had no problems connecting to the internet.  I did the Windows update then created an account with a password and I was done.  It took me a bit to get used to Windows 8 and the laptop's touchscreen features but, it was not difficult.  Picking the down arrow from the start page will take you to the list of apps and programs installed.  Picking Vaio desktop from the start page will take you to your \"desktop\".The Build:Quality.  Made with tough aluminum alloy parts and beautifully radiused corners and edges.  The touchpad (mouse area) is firm.  The keyboard keys are light to the touch, use a short stroke, and the lettering is big.  The keys are also backlit in low light settings which is very nice.  Overall the unit is about 1 inch thick when the clamshell is closed up.  The weight with battery is under 6 pounds.  Overall a great design.  The only thing I can think of to improve upon is maybe some more vents for ventillation.  I like the offwhite color finish used on everything except the bottom.The Screen:The touchscreen is bright and vivid.  The resolution is crisp and measures 1920 X 1080 pixels.  The screen uses backlight LED technology to increase brightness while saving power.  NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M is the graphics processor installed and it includes PhysX for gaming.  The touchscreen features are much easier to work with than I thought they would be and the screen is very responsive to the touch.  The screen is surrounded by a black border.The Sound:The speaker system also includes a subwoofer.  Well I tried the sound out and I am not impressed.  It's OK for just one person sitting in front of it.  To be fair I do not have any other laptop to compare it to.  I was curious and wanted to play some music.  When I find a graphic equalizer on this computer I will try and adjust the sound for more bass.  I think it would be better to use earbuds.Software that comes installed:This is a very extensive list, or I would type it for all to see.  Note that Kaspersky internet security and Microsoft office are trial versions.  Adobe Photoshop Elements 12 is certainly a nice addition as I like to edit and improve my photos.Other Features include:Touchscreen Keyboard - Security Considerations........Makes it more difficult for malware by reducing the risk of keystroke logging.  When typing, the touchscreen keyboard key lights up briefly and you hear a \"click\" sound.  Nicely done!Assist Button / Vaio Care - Checks for notices and installs updates for the computer.  Performs regular maintenance of your VAIO computer and tries to solve problems you might encounter when using the computer.Sony Rapid Wake technology - Nice feature.Energy Star certified", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "LOVEEEEEE it!", "Author": "J.Ramdath", "ReviewID": "RSZT6FPIT9QMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It works great.

It took me awhile to get used to Windows 8, but after that, all went well. It is fast and easy to use.  The touchscreen is cool and the lighted keyboard has my wife envious.

I found this one and had it on my wish list for a few months waiting to see if I found something that had all these features but also played Blu-rays but around this price.  I never could find anything so I finally took the plunge and am so happy I did!I'm still trying to get used to Windows 8 but I love it!  It is fast and has a big hard drive.  I especially love the back-lit keyboard.  I got the white one and it is just beautiful.  I am so happy with it but just in case anything does happen, I did buy the warranty with this item.My only complaint would be the Blu-ray issue but maybe I can change the drive if I can find something compatible.  Other than that, no complaints and I am happy with everything else on it.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Expected a high quality product", "Author": "Xeryus", "ReviewID": "R359FWGAK89DUG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop in April and discovered a few issues with the screen. Yellow tint can be found at the bottom corners and the whites tend to look a bit grainy. I'm unsure if this next issue is actually \"normal\" for these touch screen devices, but you could see faint black bars when viewing white backgrounds. You will only notice them however, if you are focused on looking for them.Now moments ago I booted up the laptop and upon typing my login credentials,the \"L\" key cap became loose. I tend to be very gentle when operating such electronics so I was completely puzzled by what had happened. I tried to fit the key cap back on but it couldn't snap into place. I carefully took the key cap with its inner and outer hinges out to see how further I could troubleshoot the problem. With the two hinges in both hands, I tried fitting them together but they kept falling apart.  I eventually took out another key cap to examine how the hinges are supposed to connect.What was revealed to me is that the inner hinge is supposed to have a two pins, each protruding from each side to lock itself into the outer hinge. I could not find any on the inner hinge for the L key. I searched everywhere on the laptop and on my desk and couldn't find any broken pins.A complete mystery to me...", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "jiyuan he", "ReviewID": "RLETU5RWH4VFQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "i didn't find any bad aspects.i like its appearance.i recommend you can buy it if you love sony's brand.it is worth its price", "Date": "May 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice laptop.", "Author": "Thien Q.

Schoonover \"Sue Yingling\"", "ReviewID": "R1P0VEPOICI5ON", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "With Smart Phones, tablets, laptops and desktops all readily available it is sometimes hard to choose the perfect web surfing device,.  This Sony VAIO has almost as large of a screen as a desk top, the easy to use touchscreen capability of a tablet,  the reasonable portability of large laptop plus it is so much easier to surf and e mail with than a smart phone.I really like the LED back lit keyboard which encircles each key and illuminates each character on the board.  The movies I have watched on this device are very sharp and clear with an accompanying superior sound quality.  On my family's home WI-FI the network connection speed is very rapid.  Windows 8.1 was already installed as was Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.  Other than charging up the battery this laptop was ready to go right out of the box.  I highly recommend this as it is a big upgrade from my previous Lenovo laptop.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i7 4500U 1.80 GHz\n8 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n1000 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.5-Inch Screen, NVIDIA GeForce GT 740M", "Name": "Sony VAIO SVF15328CXW 15.5-Inch Touchscreen i7 Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QQWuUh2ZL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HED0182"}}
