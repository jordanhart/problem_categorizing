I have to say that this machine handles SolidWorks better than my desktop ever did.  I find my self using the laptop instead of the desktop.  Some key things that should be done to the laptop after you buy it is up grade the RAM.  This puppy can handle 32GB!!!!! Also, add a solid state drive.  My laptop literally take 3-4 seconds to boot up.  Its quicker to reboot the computer that to resume, crazy right?  One this that you should know, this laptop is a beast.  It's heavy but very solid.  I feel that it will last awhile before i need to replace it.  As for the price, I paid $800 which is a steal.  Comparable computers from best buy or Fry's would have sold for $2000+ and they don't even have the 2GB quadro video card needed for the professional applications I run.  In short, get it.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "sweet, tough little lap top", "Author": "nico55", "ReviewID": "R1DWCLS23CEX49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this laptop has been absolutely great. it has every thing you need, is well built and looks great.i have had mine for a year now and i stand behind this thing, i work it hrad too, i run every thing on this guy, statistical software in R, my poorly written memory hungry python scripts, too games and movies. i couldn't be happier with my choice.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "HELEN TANG", "ReviewID": "RS057QVQ9ONP1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop was just like new.

Novak Jr.", "ReviewID": "R2YDQJNNN9J9GL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this product for a steal at $650 refurbished and I love it.  What people need to remember is this is not a laptop, it's a mobile workstation.  This is thick and feels very solid.  If you want to walk around w/something you're better off w/a tablet in this day and age anyway.  Elitebooks are military grade and are tested to last in various harsh conditions, like sandblasting at it for 16 hours.  This is designed to be a replacement for a desktop computer and with a docking station does a tremendous job at that.  The only bottleneck is the hard drive.  A 500GB 7200RPM isn't bad, but I wanted to replace it w/a SSD to improve battery life and obviously speed.  Another perk to this machine is the bottom panel has a quick release latch to make it easy to switch out parts w/much less effort.  I'd also like to point out the touchpad is also quite smooth and feels like a quality touchscreen.  Trust me all touchpads are not created equal.  In any case, I plan to keep this machine for years to come!", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "What's up with HP quality control?", "Author": "Joanna Benz \"Joanna Benz\"", "ReviewID": "RDKCCHNO49WK3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This looks like a fabulous machine, and I really loved the specs.  So I ordered this laptop twice from another vendor.-- The first time, I returned it for a large cosmetic blemish on the trackpad.-- On the second laptop, the battery could not be installed due to faulty latches on the back.Both laptops were brand new, purchased from a famous discount company, and probably dropshipped.  The outside cartons were in perfect condition -- but the inside boxes that actually held the computers were both damaged (one severely damaged).Because of these quality control issues, I decided not to risk ordering a third time, and just went with Toshiba, instead.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0052NL6JY"}}
