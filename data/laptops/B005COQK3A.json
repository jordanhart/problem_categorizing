Negative was no webcam or cd drive. However Now a days everything is on external drives anyway and webcams I use very rarely. Although I did buy an external dvd drive and webcam. I ABSOLUTELY love this better than any laptop or netbook I have had in the past. The service was EXCELLENT. I wasbeing deployed and the seller worked with me to intercept the package and ship another one next day. I had to pay the shipping but was a big surprise he helped out so much given the circumstances. If you have the money and looking for a COOL, FUN, HIGH SPEED,  AFFORDABLE, and TOUGH netbook and have the money BUY IT!!! You will NOT regret it. I can not say enough about this toughbook or the seller who helped out so much during a very difficult transaction.", "Date": "December 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just as described", "Author": "Hospitality Safety Consultants \"Hospitality S...", "ReviewID": "RI7GV0VL8W374", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great value, fast shipping and amazing machine.
