Not a gamer or heavy graphics user so all out power is not necessary...just reliable basic web access and computing...and the occasional DVD/Movie.First off, you can tell this case is used for more than one machine as the HDMI output is blocked off.  Custom it is not. While the keyboard layout is pretty good it does have some \"give\" which gives it a less than solid feel. The touchpad is quite sensitive and I found myself accidentally having the cursor go haywire. I now disable it when using a mouse.  I do like the dedicated number pad but find it interesting there is no volume control...only on screen.4 USB ports is a bonus plus the built in web cam...something not found on many of the bargain units.  The battery charges very fast and in heavy/constant use I have been getting 2.5+ hours.Speed is fair and likely with a bump in the memory it will increase a bit.  Fortunately you can upgrade up to 8 gig.Not much else to say yet...but if all you need is a basic machine for less than $350 this could be your ticket.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "awesome value", "Author": "Michael Mason", "ReviewID": "R3BCROG3DPKYQJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great all around laptop for the money.

I need it only for single things to do.The best part is it is a really lightweight.Otherwise it is a normally LaptopI found only two very bad pointsOne is the option to recognize your fingerprint. It works very bad. You have to move your finger a lot of times over the sensor before it recognize it.The second and worst point is the option to recognize by camera. Forget it. If you use this option the windows never booted correctly and I needed a lot of attempts to start the system. Then I deleted the driver and since this time I didn't have anymore problems with this Laptop. Overall it is not bad. My friend said if you buy a computer for $ 4000, you get it. If you buy it for $ 350 you get it too.

Lenovo has an excellent reputation and the price was great.  After using the machine now for 5 months, I have found I made a mistake in purchasing this laptop and wish I could return it.  I am having issues connecting to the internet.  Windows 7 is dropping the wireless connection ever 20 - 30 seconds and reconnecting.  This causes pages not found which I have to reload and dropped videos.  Since the main purpose of using this machine is to surf the internet (it is not very powerful and was purchased for that purpose), this is disappointing.  I have also run into issues with reading some DVDs, though it will read others.  Same disks have no issues on any other machine I've tried.Is the fault of all this Lenovo's or Microsoft's?  No idea.  And as far as I am concerned it does not matter.  Lenovo should have tested this system better and made it sure it worked correctly.  The DVD drive should work with the disks used.  Is the drive going?  Again no idea.  I can't tell when it started having this issue since I did not test DVDs until recently, but again, poor quality.I have not given up on getting the system to work and will most likely try another operating system, but it has hurt my opinion about the quality of Lenovos.I suggest you look for something else.EDIT - 12/8/2011After playing around with different options, I have found gotten the wireless not to disconnect (though I don't know if it is a permenant fix).  I also found the issue with the unreadable DVDs (long folder name in a subfolder - though Windows XP had no problems).  So is the issue Windows 7 is more finicky and I should not be blaming Lenovo?  I tend to group the computer and OS together unless I planned on using another OS.  In any case, with the problems (at least for now fixed), I feel comfortable updating the rating from 2 stars to 3 stars.  Why not 4 or more?  Because:A brand new system really should not be giving me issues that every other device connected to my wireless do not.  A brand new system should not give me issues with DVDs that an older OS has no problems with.  Finally, I did try to run Linux from a bootable CD and it did not run well (so this computer is not non-Windows friendly).  For all that, I'll do 3 stars.", "Date": "December 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "excellent", "Author": "jacob martinez", "ReviewID": "R1NFVD8ZXDRN6C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "wifi no problemsneed to up ram 6 or moreeasy useexcellent with windows 8every day usehappy with my buy.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent laptop for a decent price", "Author": "Lady Ren", "ReviewID": "R189G4WHS19NSJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was delivered on time.

In the past year I bought 4GB of RAM, a new Solid State Hard Drive and installed Windows 7 64-bit. Things seemed great but when I would push the laptop to play video games on High Performance it now has trouble holding a steady FPS (Frames Per Second). In other words, games which did work are barely running and they lag too much that gaming is unenjoyable. These are games made around 2009 to 2010. It seems Intel's HD Graphics gets worn out and will lose its horsepower. Other than that, for the price it's a great laptop to own! It was just frustrating to be involved in a game and find out it can't play anymore. It's time to upgrade to a better system.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "DO NOT BUY (Please facebook before you waste your money)", "Author": "Latoya", "ReviewID": "R1MJWV6WDLLQFM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For the record: I took  very good care of my laptop.

Please do not by any products from this company.I have this computer sitting in my closet and its only 2 years old.  From the moment I purcahsed this laptop there has been problem after problem. I had to take the very first one back to best buy and they exchanged it for another one. First it was the grinding noises and it takes for every to start. Twice the computer goes dead with no power. The first time it went out I sent it back to the company on my dime and within 7 months later this computer went dead again with the same problem. Customer service is the worst I have ever experience It took them two months to even respond to my complaint about my laptop. They refused to fix my laptop unless I pay for it out of pocket even thou they did not appearing fix it because it was only 7 months later.
