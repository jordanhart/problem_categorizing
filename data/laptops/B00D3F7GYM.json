Or you can pay through the nose for expert help to get those drivers.  They no loger have all of the drivers available for download on their web site. WOW - I guess they don't want any new business!Because of their business policy changes, I am now recommending to all of my clients to stay far away from Toshiba products.", "Date": "September 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Absolute Piece of JUNK!", "Author": "Deborah Fleishman", "ReviewID": "R2OG0X1WTYG79S", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will never buy another Toshiba product again, and I will never buy another computer from Amazon again.  The computer I bought was supposed to be new, but it appears that Quality Seller sold me a used product.  If not, why has someone previously used a Dell computer with this laptop?  This has been a lemon from the first month, and I am so sorry I tried to contact Toshiba instead of returning it.  I have to restore this piece of crap to factory default every month, and when I do that I have to reset the touchpad functions because it will not scroll. It also has driver issues.  Obviously the first owner never registered this product, and when it was found to be a lemon, returned it forgetting to delete the Dell printer hardware.  I have only had this piece of junk for less than 5 months.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, just not happy with Windows 8", "Author": "newdog", "ReviewID": "RQ87V0H8TGC83", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this for my spouse and I asked her to rate it on a scale of 1 to 5.

Good price and functionality.With my kids frequently on the PC, I bought this laptop.  While specs are better than the L505.  It runs VERY slow.  Even my nine year old says its slow and prefers the older laptop.  The sound is also very \"tinny,\" both when using the on-board speakers, as well as when you use the jack and output to external speakers.When I called Toshiba, I got a recorded message saying my warranty expired - even though I just received it ~ 6 days earlier.This laptop works, looks nice, but again is very slow.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "Intel Core i3-3120M 2.5 GHz\n4 GB DIMM RAM\n750 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen, Mobile Intel\u00ae HD graphics\nWindows 8", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite C55-A5246NR 15.6-Inch Laptop (Satin Black in Trax Horizon)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41O8rtR%2BQWL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00D3F7GYM"}}
