{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Almost exceeds my expectations", "Author": "Nse Ette", "ReviewID": "R2MTISNF39J01C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Asus X102BA touch laptop because it wasn't too expensive, boots up as fast as a tablet, the screen is touchscreen, and it comes with Microsoft Office (home and student edition) pre installed.The screen is 10.1\", it is slim, sleek and lightweight with a nice matte finish to the top and Asus written in silver. The battery is built in (like a tablet) and can't be removed. Battery fully charges in just over an hour and lasts about 5 hours. I haven't experienced any overheating after lengthy use. Ram is 4Gb and I have the 500Gb harddrive version.The laptop boots from off in under 30 seconds, after which you can leave it in sleep mode (which drains only about 8% battery power over 24 hours). It switches on practically instantaneously from sleep mode.I was a bit worried about Windows 8 which I'd never used before and which seems to get poor reviews but I rather like it and find it intuitive to use. The swiping from left or right, as well as the tiles make this easy to use, especially with the touchscreen. one minor grouse is that some programmes (e.g Chrome browser, Facebook app) don't have the 'X' at the top right to shut them down. To do this, one needs to get to the Windows Task Manager by pressing Shift + CTRL + Esc, Select app, and click end task button.The processor is dual core AMD A4-1200 clocked at 1.0GHz, fast enough for me. I notice no lag as I switch between, or use multiple programmes (iTunes, AutoCAD, among others) or apps. There are two USB 2.0 and one USB 3.0 port, and a slot for an SD card.Speaking of Apps, that's another downer here as the Microsoft store is very skimpy compared to the Android or Apple stores. Apart from this, I find I'm liking this gadget more and more as I use it.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Value Priced PC", "Author": "E Body Driver", "ReviewID": "R38XUM3E8PSIS2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great small computer for thiose who want to use it as a computer-- This is not the fastest processor in the market-- but this item is great!
