Mike", "ReviewID": "R1AVGZCH4DYJ2X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was excited to get this laptop, but had problems with it from the beginning. The battery stopped working about two months after I bought it, and I had to send it in for repairs. Even though it was only a problem with the battery, HP erased my whole hard drive. Several months later my laptop started turning off without warning. HP suggested I reseat the memory, and the cheap plastic piece holding the memory snapped off when I moved them. This didn't resolve the problem, as my computer got progressively worse and eventually wouldn't even start. HP wouldn't cover the repairs, because I didn't have the \"right\" warranty. When I sent it in anyway, they told me the motherboard and hard drive needed to be replaced. Knowing the hard drive was fine, I didn't have them repair it, though they still want to charge me for their incorrect diagnosis. Another company repaired it by flashing the bios. Nothing was wrong with the hard drive. Several months after that I'm again having problems with my laptop turning off when I touch it in certain places and the graphics card isn't working correctly. Also, hp has told me I owe them several hundred dollars for repairs they haven't completed. I've had this laptop less than a year.", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice out of the box", "Author": "Danielle Sellars", "ReviewID": "R1V3XZ23U8JB0U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just bought this laptop and wanted to post a few thoughts that I've had since opening the box a few hours ago.1. This is the first computer that I've owned that didn't ship FULL of crapware. This thing is meant for businesses so it was thankfully clear of all of the \"free\" games and junk that you usually get on a new computer.2. The quickweb feature is pretty slick. Boots to a functional browser and skype, as well as a number of widgets within about 10 seconds. I was surprised by the capability of the browser available in that mode.3. It's pretty zippy, even though the RAM isn't maxed out right out of the box. I purchased a 4 GB chip to add to the computer but as of right now I don't think it strictly NEEDS it to run quite nicely.4. The quality of the webcam is pretty damn good. Tried it out in the quickweb skype app and had no complaints.", "Date": "July 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "AMAZING UNIT!", "Author": "Zack", "ReviewID": "RPZNY1XFX2V3Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This unit is AMAZING!I have the version with the Amd processor instead of the i3, with Win 7 pro.I've owned it for about a year, and the only issue i've came across is a faulty disk drive,Even then (after my warranty has expired) Hp is overnighting me a new drive free of charge.You do need to email/contact them VIA live support to get your restore disks though,I've upgraded mine to 8 gig's of ram, and it runs like a champ!Highly recommended machine, and A++ customer service from HPGreat buy!", "Date": "August 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Heavy, terrible battery, crappy camera, shuts off randomly", "Author": "Kzf", "ReviewID": "R2L3X0G0OZA5WP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "When I first got this laptop two years ago, I was very excited. It has a very attractive, sleek metal look to it, had great reviews, and was a great size screen. I installed two of the best anti-virus software approved by all my computer programmer and IT friends. It ran great for the first year and I was very happy. After about a year, my computer would randomly crash. My friend was a software engineer at HP so he looked at it and fixed it for me. Within a matter of weeks it was back to shutting down my programs. I figured out that if I powered the computer off and back on again it worked fine. Also, I would be typing emails and it would randomly not let me use specific keyboard functions. The keys didn't seem to be sticking, but then again you never know.Lastly, the battery completely stopped functioning last month (almost two years after I bought it). There really wasn't any warning. It just stopped holding charge even though I had it plugged in for hours. I'm not an expert on PC's but I try to take care of my computers. I never had this much trouble with a PC before. It's rather frustrating. I don't believe I'll ever buy another HP computer and I don't recommend this one.", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP Wifi Problems", "Author": "Adam", "ReviewID": "R220L65BUYC7UM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought it for my parents.Works well except for the well known HP wifi isssue where it just suddenly dislikes your network and drops.Nice basic laptop otherwise.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Josh", "ReviewID": "R2X22HID7BLB27", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love HP laptops and this one is really good.
