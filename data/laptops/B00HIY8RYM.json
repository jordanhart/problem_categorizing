{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I wouldn't trade it... so far.", "Author": "Carol Burns", "ReviewID": "R1MJ2I6FSEI4KS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a laptop to replace my desktop, and I needed something with a good processor, a good amount of ram, and a nice graphics card. With this laptop, I got ALL of that. I have the speed and reliability I need for my job, and I was surprised at how thin and light this machine is compared to a lot of the high end gaming laptops.The trackpad is a nice size, really responsive, and I like that I can easily disable it to use a mouse if needed (I do graphics and video work and gaming - need a mouse for that)I love the back-lit keyboard and how the keys are a good size. I like the orientation of the numpad as well. It is nicely integrated with the rest of the keyboard layout. The only con I can say with that is the orientation of the right shift key. It is smaller than normal to make room for the arrow keys, so I often hit the up arrow rather than shift, which kind of sucks when I'm capping the letter \"I\" and end up with a cursor on the next line above.I WISH this had come pre-loaded with Win7 rather than Win8, but with the more recent updates to 8.1, the wireless card driver issue the 8.1 upgrade was having seems to be corrected, as well as a few other drivers issues. NO fault of the hardware, just Microsoft having their heads where the sun forgets to shine sometimes. Also, be reminded ~ not a touch screen machine (thank goodness, in my case) so Win8 is kind of just fluffy on it, which takes some getting used to when you're a lover of Win7.I have noticed, that when gaming, this machine does get HOT. It's not a gaming rig, and so that is understandable, and the addition of a cooling pad with good fans fixes that issue.All other times, when not running games, this stays incredibly cool, and it's so quiet that I really don't even hear the fan.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Powerful i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, 17.3'' screen. The ideal desktop replacement laptop.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2KN6DORVXLZZ5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop through Amazon as soon as it became available at about $1000. I was looking for a desktop replacement laptop for my almost 9-year old but still working fine Acer Aspire. I had set a price limit of about $1000. Although its main use would be in the office I could not resist to the really good specifications. It was the first time I got a Lenovo laptop and I was thinking to go for the thinkpad line which is like the successor of the famous IBM line. However the cost exceeded my allocated budget.As soon as I received the laptop and unboxed it and proceeded with the installation I unfortunately found out that the DVD drive did not eject neither manually nor when clicking \"eject\" after right clicking the DVD icon in windows explorer. Needless to say that I was totally disappointed at first as I did not have such an experience with my previous Acer,Dell and Asus laptops. However, Amazon accepted the return of the laptop and sent to me right away (1-day shipping) a brand new one and compensated me fully for the return shipping expenses.After 1 month of continuous use the laptop is working fine, it has met my expectations of processing speed and quality of the screen.Although it is a 17.3 inch laptop it is relatively light although I do not intend to carry it in my bag on a daily basis.All in all, it is surely a value for money laptop as its specifications are really on the high end level.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast,great all around system!", "Author": "N.

The only \"irritant\" was the battery \"watcher\" continually telling me to unplug it or it will wear out the battery.....

First, the reviewer who says it is cheap and plasticky, I do not get this impression at all. It's a solid laptop with a quality, tight build and \"nice plastics\" as they say in the car interior reviews. This thing looks and feels more upscale than the current crop of Dells and is hundreds cheaper. Comes with GeForce GT745M 2gb and you can set this as default. The Intel graphics are integrated with the 4th generation processors. nvidea's software does a good job of auto-detecting so that you're using Intel graphics when using chrome or whatever and nvidia if playing a game, media player, or again you can just set nvidia as default. The laptop is extraordinarily fast, has an amazing display, and has not crashed or been buggy at all. Runs games beautifully, don't care that it isn't a gtx series gpu.  I'm going from hating to loving Windows 8. I'm glad I waited for a laptop that came with 8.1; have heard upgrading from 8 was a nightmare for many. Also learned that I wanted to be sure to get 1920x1080 resolution and not the 1600x900 that many 17\" coming with. What I didn't get during my laptop research was how much harder it is to find the 17 incher i wanted and was in my price range. Lenovo makes the Y510p, where's the Y710p? I guess us 17 inch people are in the minority. Finally, if you google laptop ratings laptop mag gave lenovo I think #2 spot for 2013 so that helped with pre-purchase confidence.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lenovo IdeaPad Z710...A darn good laptop for my needs", "Author": "Rock n' Roll", "ReviewID": "RJ3ZJ3O2J4CPG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a good laptop with a 17 inch screen to watch movies (with BD player), listen to music (good speakers), surf the web and for DJ'ing. I found this laptop after doing a lot of research and I just hooked it up with my Traktor Audio 10 and it worked very well once I installed the necessary drivers and programs.I was initially going to purchase a much more expensive MSI Dominator PRO 888 for $2800, but decided it was overkill for my overall use (not a gamer). I can honestly say that this was an excellent choice for me at just under $1000 (hey, saved $1800). In my opinion, this is a pretty darn good laptop.What I Like about this product:Illuminated key board (must press the FN + Space bar to activate this feature)JBL Speakers (must set up your sound preference in audio controls)17 inch screenBlue Ray PlayerIntel Core I7 Processor1 TB hard driveWhat I do not like:Battery life is not that great (I get about 3+ hours)Keyboard feels mushy in the center (keyboard looks a bit puffy on the center portion of the keyboard)Laptop is heavy due to its sizeThe benefits outweigh the negatives in my opinion.  I highly recommend this laptop (even if it comes with a learning curve for Windows 8).I think that if you get a Lenovo Z710 Laptop for the purposes that I mentioned above, you will not regret it.

Lots of features for the money and performs well.That being said, this is not a perfect machine. The screen has a very narrow field of vision and is highly reflective which makes it less than optimal in many situations. I added an anti-glare screen which helps greatly. The chicklet-style keyboard is horrendous at best. However, flat chicklet-style keys on new laptops are equally horrible experiences for those of us used to tactile sculpted keys.If you can compromise with its few but ultra-annoying shortcomings, it's a very good value.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelent !!!", "Author": "Carlos Garzon", "ReviewID": "R2ONBD26ICLVOF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is very fast and robust, has nothing to envy to the rest of the others, I really recommend this laptop. excellent purchase I made and thank the seller", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HIY8RYM"}}
