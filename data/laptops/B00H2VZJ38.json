Purchased 2 on Black Friday.  I have been a Mac baby for the past 7 years and the thought of buying a PC was kind of disheartening.  I have used it for about a month now and am quite surprised.  It is fast and the HD screen is incredible.  If it had a backlit keyboard I would have given it 5 stars.  Haven't played any games on it yet.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great, Fast Working laptop!!", "Author": "William Paul Luttrell Jr.", "ReviewID": "R3FU5Y3EE4H8W6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bough this from another website. But thought I'd submit a review here.The laptop is extremely fast! Boots up quickly, I got a program called startisback to make it look like windows 7 was installed. I'm not a fan of windows 8 in anyway..the 8gb of ram is more than enough! Thought wouldn't mind maxing it out all the way (Which I couldn't find 12gb or 16gb max??)The quad core processor is good too at multi tasking, every now and then windows 8 boggs up and freezes though (Wish I had windows 7 installed)The processor even though 2.1ghz , it does the job very very well! May turbo boost but don't want to void warranty..Overall I give this a 9/10. The video card was not dedicated like I thought. Though it holds up to most mid games.Great laptop for the price!!", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Does not come with Microsoft programs", "Author": "red", "ReviewID": "RWW98C8G31UWU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "It does not have any Microsoft Programs on it. It does have windows 8, but not the latest version which is 8.1. I am not computer literate so even though I know I can upgrade it to 8.1 for free I have no idea how. I wish they would have done this for us. There are a lot of programs on there when you start that you don't need. I got on my yahoo mail and I can be in the middle of a game and my mail would take over my computer when I get a message. I am having a hard time personalizing it cause I have to delete every thing that is on there. and I don't know exactly what I am doing. I hope I am not deleting any thing I need. other then that it runs great for me only having it less then a week. If any one can advise me on how to improve things to fit my needs I would appreciate it.That was yesterday. After finally reading my windows apps I was able to get windows 8.1 quite easily. And I am ok with it not having Microsoft cause then I might be stuck with Microsoft 2013 and I decided I wanted Microsoft 2010. Which Means I did not have to Uninstall Microsoft 2013 before I loaded 2010. So Today I am happier then I was yesterday :)", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Like dealing with Amazon because I trust them.", "Author": "Ken Aspinall", "ReviewID": "R25BQLNFV88P0M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great computer but wish the key board could lite up.

We were going to give it to him in May when he actually graduates, but the computer was shipped in the computer box with just a vacuumed plastic \"bag\" around it - no cushioning, not exterior box.  I could hear rattling in the box, grew nervous, and had to give him the computer (It only had a 14 day return policy) early so he could check it out and make sure it worked correctly.  For this reason I am giving the computer 4 stars - which is no fault of the computer!

Colvill", "ReviewID": "R2PCQ1P0MTD16B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This machine is trash. I purchased from Office Depot and I've had nothing but problems. Machine has underperformed in every game and every benchmark I've used, including Passmark, 3dmark, Furmark, and more. I wasn't trying to play anything amazing on it either, just Dota 2, which could only run on low settings at a choppy 20-30 fps. Current benchmarks put the Radeon 8610G on par with an Intel HD 4600, but I've got one of those too, and this isn't even close. The memory is the worst part, 8gb of Samsung DDR3, single channel, that clocks about as slow as 2gb of DDR2. This machine is a joke, and doesn't come close to the promised performance.I've tried to contact HP customer support, and from my very first contact they agreed there was a problem, and shipped me a box to send it in. Well they shipped it right back and all they did was restore it to factory defaults, completing ignoring my very detailed description of the problems. When I called to ask about it, they had no idea what they were talking about, and all they could say was to send it back in again, and this time, the lady promised me, she would take personal responsibility for it, and would call me if she could not reproduce my problem. Again I typed a very detailed write-up of the tests I ran, and reiterated my desire to be contacted. Well, I never got that call, and today received an email saying they had completed repairs and had already shipped it back without checking with me. What did they do this time? They replaced the touchscreen. D'OH! Twice now I've sent this machine in and twice it's been sent right back to me without the problem solved, and not for lack of customer input either! Rest assured I've got some more words for them.TL;DR:  this machine is rubbish and HP technical support is either completely inept, or lazy and ignores customers' problems in hopes they'll just go away and deal with it. This isn't HP bashing--this as close to an objective account I can give, and I'm prepared to back up my claims if anybody has any questions. Bottom line though: don't buy this machine, and don't buy anything from HP at all if you have any notion that you might need support for it.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP Pavilion TouchSmart 15-n071nr Laptop Computer With 15.6\" Touch-Screen Displa", "Author": "Eric Weaver", "ReviewID": "R3BLQV4TWFR5MN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Computer is great....
