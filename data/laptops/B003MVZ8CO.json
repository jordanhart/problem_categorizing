Morgan", "ReviewID": "R27M9BXH99ISCW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop 1 month ago off of Amazon, the 4 gb of ram with the i5 processor keep this laptop competitive with the best of them, there were a couple little features that I was pretty excited about when I got this laptop, the facial recognition software, and the sleep and charge, so I can charge my camera while keeping the laptop closed. I was a little disappointed with the facial recognition because it sometimes takes a while to recognize your face and its easier to just type in a password. There are two other things that worry me a little but I am sure if I take it to best buy or Toshiba they can help me out, but the touchpad on the laptop has a button that is suppose to turn it on or off, so that you don't move the cursor while you have a mouse plugged in, and it stopped working. Also there is a button on the top that turns off the lights so that if your running it at night they don't shine in your eyes, that button also stopped working. The graphics card in this laptop makes it easy to play games like Starcraft on low and even medium settings. I love the way that the laptop looks and the harman/kardon speakers are better than any other build in laptop speakers I have ever heard. It can easily edit videos with its stats and is much faster at rendering videos than my old desktop. The battery life will last about 2 and a half or 3 hours if you are just messing around on the Internet with it and have the screen brightness turned down a little but not so much that it doesn't completely light up the keyboard in darkness (about 75% of its potential brightness). Internet is very quick and even if you do not have a wireless N router you will be able to tell the difference from a laptop that is not wireless N capable, watching shows on Hulu my old laptop use to freeze at least once every show I would watch and out of watching 25 or so shows on this laptop it only froze once, then once you get this laptop on a wireless N network the internet is noticeably faster. The big problem I could see anyone having with this laptop is price, and if you want a laptop for its performance, this one definitely has the performance. I have PC Matic on this computer and it is ranked between the top 6 and 13 percent of computers, the best one in the house (even better than my dads desktop with the i7). To compare this to a MAC, my friend recently got a 2007 macbook for the same price as this computer, and my laptop has a better processor, the same amount of ram, a better video card, same size hard drive, and a 3 inch bigger screen.", "Date": "September 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Very pleased with this computer", "Author": "Buddy", "ReviewID": "R390WLCIPR5X4P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had read some negative comments from reviews over on best buy about this particular computer. I bought it anyway. I'm glad I did. It is a very powerful computer and has not had a single problem to date. No heat messages, no crashes, no anything. I work 12 hours and I leave it on a desk running for the whole 12 hours. The cooling fan comes on once and a while, but it is not noisy. The keyboard keys have a positive feel to them and make typing fairly easy, for a laptop. The display is an LED/LCD and has wonderful definition and color. The speakers are excellent for such a small installation. Hey, this is a great computer for the price, which was enough cheaper at amazon to make the wait for shipping worth the while. I'm well pleased overall.", "Date": "October 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect computer for an amazing price", "Author": "TL", "ReviewID": "RK2162LHTDNQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is amazing. It's i5 processor, 4GB RAM, ample Hard Drive storage, integrated webcam w/ facial recognition and a variety of other bonuses make this computer an excellent buy, especially for the price.

After reviewing each brand I ended up with the Toshiba Satellite A665 and I love it! It is super fast, easy to learn, beautiful pics,sound,etc. Plenty of memory and superfast.

I had this i5, and even got an i7 for my husband.  Bad choice.  Both computers needed disk replacements, had cooling problems, and finally the technical company said the motherboard is not well manufactured/ensambled, and these are common problems with Satellite.With the same care, similar time and similar work load, the durability and reliability of Toshiba's Satellite is very poor compared with Tecra and Sony, and just poor compared to ACER and Dell for example.I guess it is good for you if you are going to change it every year.  But if you have the budget then buy a better Sony.", "Date": "November 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Purchase for my son", "Author": "Sherry Cynowa", "ReviewID": "R1OTRCY6N50E4A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I highly recommend toshiba, we have purchase 5 toshiba's and get about 5-6 years out of each of them. comes well equipped and holds up well to a 14-15 year old.", "Date": "November 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Keyboard problems, AWFUL customer service", "Author": "M. Trachtenberg", "ReviewID": "R2T5BIHT6J32BX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought two identical Toshiba A665 s6056 from Amazon.  One clearly had the wrong disk image on arrival.  I needed to use the computer, so I couldn't send it in for repair.  After hours on the phone with tech non-support, I got someone who seemed intelligent and they decided that my best bet was to force a factory reinstall using some magic power-and-key sequence.  We agreed it would probably just reinstall the wrong image, but that I didn't have a lot of other options. What they DIDN'T tell me was that the process would take several hours, and that I'd have to attend it or come around every half hour to see what key needed to be pressed by which superfluous stopping point.Meanwhile, it's a year later.  The CPU fan grinds and the Esc key constantly triggers, regardless of whether anyone is near the computer.I had good experiences with Toshiba in the 90s.  It's a shame what's become of them.

I sent it in to Toshiba and they \"fixed\" it and also mentioned that they had to replace the hardrive. After 3 months the keys started going out again. According to other reviews I have found on the net it seems that alot of people had the same problem and the keyboard should have been considered defective. I mentioned this to Toshiba and they said that customers rarely have this problem so I sent it in for a second time. They replaced the keyboard and the harddrive again. The problem happened a third time this time my warranty was up. I gave Toshiba an ear full because they never fixed the problem. They blew me off and I have to say that their customer service sucks. The computer looks nice and it cost a pretty penny but I will never purchase a Toshiba product again. Trust me do your research and go with another manufacturer. Poor product and horrible customer service to boot.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "reliable laptop", "Author": "Omee", "ReviewID": "R1EJKIVRYVPIWN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is good all around laptop. It is small enough to be portable but large enough to be a desktop replacement. I have had several Toshiba laptops and they have been very reliable. I keep my computers for a long time and then pass them on to a family member or friend. My original one is still going strong and it is over eight years old. This laptop has enough power and memory to grow with the changes in operating systems and software. I am not a gamer so I can not speak to that but I find that it responds quickly for the tasks that I perform. The monitor is clear, the sound is crisp and the keyboard comfortable.", "Date": "February 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bought this for my aunt", "Author": "Coolcat", "ReviewID": "R1PCNJCSPREF0Y", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I having been helping family members buy computers for a long time now and after having her try out numerous computers she went with this Toshiba. Performance wise it works fantastically but there are a few things I want to comment on that need a lot of improvement. Before you buy see if you can cope with these misgivings: The camera is garbage, I am spoiled with a 3.0megapixel Macbook pro camera but even compared to a 2.0megapixel web cam the toshiba's looks like large descriptive blobs; WiFi, for some reason the toshiba laptop we got has an incredibly hard time connecting to a Wireless G network even from five feet away, once it is plugged into a power source it magically works. One of the weirdest things I have seen in a long time (must think its a radio from the 70s that uses the home electrical wires as an antenna); the screen; this is the largest disappointment for me, for a company that makes televisions you would expect a lot more out of them, the screen looks washed out and if in direct sunlight nearly impossible to see.Overall a decent laptop with good battery life. My only gripes with the laptop seems to be my problems with all Toshiba laptops screens, webcams, and wifi. In terms of raw computing power its performs flawlessly.", "Date": "February 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Laptop", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "RLI1ZMO765ZM4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great laptop for the money.

The first incident, it froze completely and I had to call tech service. They told me I may have lost the operating system. The first attempt to fix the problem did not work, that was press the power buton and keep hitting f8 . The second attempt was to push the numeric 0 and the power button, this reloaded over 31,000 files and fixed the problem. Since then I have had several hang ups, where I had to shut down and reboot in safe mode, then shut down and reboot again. It has been frustrating, my 2 previous pc's were Dell with which, I had no problem.", "Date": "August 16, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003MVZ8CO"}}
