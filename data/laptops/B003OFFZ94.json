{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Gaming Machine For the Money", "Author": "Phil \"The Goalie\"", "ReviewID": "R1M4RJJZYLQ3LF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Although this laptop makes a few sacrifices in quality for the sake of bringing you affordable power, it is really a great little, or should I say BIG, laptop.First off I want to address the overheating issues that others mentioned.  I originally thought that my G72 was overheating too.  It would randomly slow down during games sometimes and it didn't seem to me to be linked to how hard it was working.  I would usually just restart the laptop and it would be fine.  Then I noticed that it seemed to only do it when I played games after waking it up from sleep mode.  I stopped using the sleep and haven't had the problem once in literally months.  I'm not sure exactly what's causing it but it definitely seems to be linked to the sleep.  It is probably a driver problem or something.  This laptop in fact has great heat management.  I have played Shogun 2 Total War on max tubo gear(the little overclocking program that comes with it) and on max setting(almost) for literaly hours at a time without any overheating problems.The Pros: This laptop has great power for the money.  Even today the GTX 260M GPU is no slouch.  You can run games like Oblivion, Medieval 2 Total war, Bioshock, Batman Arkham Asylum and other such games on full setting with no problem at all.  The newest game I have played on it is Shogun 2 Total War.  I run it with the best settings except for some of the fancier shadow effects, I don't use blur effects and only use 4x anti aliasing. It does very well.  The larger battles slow down a bit but over all it's very playable.  The laptop is also pretty cool looking with the lights and stuff.  It has decent battery life for the type of laptop(about 2hrs).  I mean let's face it, for gaming laptops the batery is just to get you from one outlet to the next.The Cons:  This laptop isn't perfect though.  I only gave it 5 stars to ballance out the other two reviews that I thought were misunderstanding the heating problem.  My biggest complaint with this laptop is the screen.  It's not terrible.  The refresh rate is good.  You don't get streaks and blurs when the action is going.  The problem is the colors.  I've just seen better color ballancing on other screens.  The other problem is it's a little picky about the angle you look at it.  The construction of the laptop is also a little on the plasticky side if you know what I mean.  I guess you have to skimp somewhere to get the price down.Over all I was very pleased with this laptop.  Had it for almost 2 years now and it's still running great.  The screen flickers sometimes but I think that's just due to a dirty connection.  When I bought it it was $1000 but even now $670 is a good price for this machine.", "Date": "October 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Long Lasting and Reliable", "Author": "Matt Zevitas", "ReviewID": "R1EFYSM2IYF5ZQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have purchased 2 of these systems and let me tell you it is a stable rig. First off, the 1600 x 900 resolution and the 1GB video card were enough to get some of the best games to run on High. I have moved on but the two friends I gave them to are still using them and they are running smoothly. The CPU is a bit slow for me but a Duo 2.7 GHz is enough to get the job down. I was able to play Diablo 3 and star craft 2 on ultra settings and even arma 2 ran okay. If you are looking for a stable gaming rig that you want on the go and do not feeling spending an arm, leg and 2 children on an alienware, this is your choice. I used this when I was in college when I had long waits between classes and for LAN parties with my friends.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "An amazing gaming laptop, but be warned of one dreaded design mistake...", "Author": "Greggory", "ReviewID": "R3655UFQ06H5HK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for over a year and it's my favorite thing ever.This laptop runs almost everything.  There is some lagging on say Civilizations V and GTA IV, but you can overclock this easily.  On that, definitely get a cooling fan for this laptop, as it really helps to increase the life and play of this laptop.  Asus makes very quality products for a relatively low price.  A definite must.I rate this a 5/5, but there is one thing that will have to be attended to either right away or months down the line.  Once it happens, it requires hardware work every couple of months.  The cord for the laptop (I forget the name of it on the top of my head) was made too short and Asus had it designed to be held with simple hard scotch tape.  When it disconnects, all you get is a white screen when the brightness is on max and black when it's not.  There is a video to fix it, so it's not a complete loss.Besides that, a very customizable laptop (two hard drive bays!) and runs so many games smoothly.  Of course most likely outdated now (technology moves quick) but it's still good enough to play even new games at the best settings (Ultra settings Skyrim is possible even without overclocking).Also, rip off the shields on both sides for the USB ports and Headphone/Mic jacks.  They're annoying.", "Date": "July 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Ate Video Games For Breakfast", "Author": "Big John", "ReviewID": "R3OJBPK7MXQRW9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is amazing!  It powers through all the games in my Steam Library.  The Nvidia GTX 260m is very fast and over clocks nicely providing for excellent frame rates.  The 500GB hard drive is very roomy with plenty of space for all my 100GB+ Steam folder.  This laptop is a true mobile gaming beast!  Buy it now, you won't be disappointed!

For gaming laptop under 1000$ I consider it very good. Very powerful for that time it could run majority of games on high settings. A little bit heat doesn't bother me if you put it on the table. I also connect it to 24inch monitor if I need a big screen to work. Plenty of memory let me work with internet without any delay.", "Date": "December 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best PC But Needs Special Care :D", "Author": "insanity7414", "ReviewID": "RJYUCIFD0DNYP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this computer did have some heating problems when I first got this. be aware you need to clean its vents monthly or yearly. this computer shows no mercy to every game I play.

I have had it for less than a year the first 6-7 months it worked amazing but after using it a while it started to slow down. the thermals characteristics are horrible it will run any of my games but after a couple hours it gets so hot i cant even run them on low. then a month back i ran into a much bigger problem the ac adapter stopped working and it would just bring up the ac/battery logo every second back and forth and  at first it would charge the batter if computer was off but not on then it would charge batter at all but if i took it out the ac only would run the computer just fine and then that stopped working and i ordered a replacement ac adapter for 60 bucks since this particular model seems to have an impossible to find size and power output even the universal rocketfish and others didnt work. so ordered the replacement from amazon and it worked great for about 2-3 weeks and now im back to where i was no laptop at all i recommend getting a different laptop.", "Date": "August 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Can be used as Heating Pad", "Author": "Leopold Stotch", "ReviewID": "RJKEQ5FIM8PTQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is the biggest piece of garbage that Asus has ever rolled out it's doors. I cannot play any games on this crap without removing the bottom plastic cover and propping the laptop UP so I can have a box fan blowing air underneath it. Poorest heating pipe design I have ever seen. EVERY SINGLE DEVICE THAT PRODUCES HEAT RUNS THROUGH THE SAME PIPE. Northbridge, GPU, CPU, RAM are all being run through the same crappy fan unit. Unless you are just browsing the web, watching movies or something else DO NOT BUY THIS FOR GAMING. You will be upset. It constantly overheats causing the unit to slow down. This Laptop should be sold for $500 at the MOST used. GARBAGE GARBAGE. Won't play games like Injustice;Gods Among Us without turning the graphics down. Good luck with any of the newer games released in 2014. Don't forget about the stock HDD that has major issues. The FAN when it's on high (which is usually about 5 minutes after any game being played and sometimes while just idle) sounds like a freight train and sometimes I wear my headphones just to not hear it. I have built computers before and I am removing this thing from the laptop and installing it into a working freezer. Be careful with the Turbo Gear function. Don't expect to get any use out of any OS that isn't 64 Bit and don't expect to find any drivers for Vista if you do. Make sure you get the copy of Windows 7 that comes with this and the restore disk or just ask the seller to knock $100 off for the copy of Windows 7 you're going to need when the boot sector of the HDD becomes corrupt (and it will).", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "This computer works great but it has video card issues.", "Author": "CJ", "ReviewID": "R63KSIJ7RH1BJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This laptop has a great video card which cannot be used to it's full potential because of the laptops thermal characteristics. Simply put, no matter what modern day 3D video game you play the video card will overheat and the frame-rate will drop to a point where playing the game is unbearable.
