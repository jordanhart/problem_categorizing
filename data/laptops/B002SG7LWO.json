I was so amazed by the speed he replied. He gave me all the informations I needed and he guaranteed me that if I order on tuesday I ll get it by friday. What I did. I was also surprised by the price. Could this be true???Anyway I decided to give it a try. Right now am so happy I made that choice the laptop was delivered on thursday everything work perfectly. I ll be able fo study for my exam.
