You would never know it is a refurb, and this is presumably because it is a hp-certified refurb. I started using windows 8 with an open mind, as I have heard from many people that it is bad but it is completely fine in my opinion. The only downside was that I was experienced and did not realise that electronic goods require you to pay customs duty. It was still a good deal but less so because of the unexpected charge. This was my own fault for not realising, but hopefully others may benefit from reading this.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Refurb Laptop", "Author": "Randolph Bass", "ReviewID": "R257RIKUKEQAFK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Laptop was refurbished so i was sceptical but not any more, it works great and has more features than i expected, the model number seems like a 15.6 screen but its a 17in screen and it is touch screen.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GVHOQM4"}}
