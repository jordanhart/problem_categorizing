I just wanted something inexpensive for my writing, some work, and basic web browsing. And it's perfect for that. I adore the keyboard on this thing. The keys are all easy to press, delightfully clunky, and unlike some other, larger laptops, you don't need to hit the keys right in the middle for them to register presses- so you're able to type much more quickly and without missing any letters.battery life isn't phenomenal, but it's not bad if you're just using a word processor and facebook, which is mostly what I use it for.love it, would buy again.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "works perfectly!", "Author": "Kenneth Hadad", "ReviewID": "RA3PFLPF83LAD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I went with Tampa because they provided me with good products in the past.

I am highly dissatisfied with the product and service. Shortly after opening the box I began sneezing; my body  began to itch as if dust mites where coming from it. The laptop was filthy, scratched up, beat up, missing parts, no battery etc. The laptop would only come on and stay on when plugged into circuit. When unplugged, the laptop immediately shuts down.  Rating of  0% due to insultingly poor service. Service to others should always be done in a spirit of excellence.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just what I needed", "Author": "chefmike200", "ReviewID": "R1H7VK2D8KHRKO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer refurbished because I did not want to spend a ton on a new machine.

This screen is huge; makes it easy to view photos and videos and be creative.  The power cord came with the laptop.
