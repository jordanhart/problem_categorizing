Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours to do the upgrades to bring it up to date.  Also, do yourself a favor and get rid of McAfee Security - Microsoft already ship Security essentials with that machine.  As far as McAfee is concerned, it's garbage.  Also get rid of that Office 2012 90 day trial-ware.c) The wireless card is single band (2.4GHz), so even if it is dual antenna (which is already much better than some machines with 1 antenna) you are stuck at 300Mbps. Not sure if Dell institute BIOS whitelisting.  If it does, your upgrade options will be limited to other Dell branded cards.d) The Inspiron 11 3000 series MIGHT have a Haswell Core i3u option coming in Q1 2014, as this has been confirmed by listings on their Dell AsiaPac sites.

Opening laptop is very easy on this unit. There are 7 screws on the back, two are under round stickers. Then simply pull hard enough for plastic clips to remove backing. There are no wires attached to the cover, and the RAM and Hard drive stare right at you. It couldn't be easier.1.) When you first receive laptop. Press FN button + power and complete the diagnostics test for your hardware. Just to confirm you're starting off ok.2.) Recommended: Replace the HDD with a SDD (I used a Samsung 128GB) and use a cloning software to mirror the original image to the new drive. Since there's no dvd-rom on this unit, you can either use a USB dvd rom along with a USB to SATA adapter or remove the original hard drive and connect both new and original to a desktop for the cloning process. Make sure to install the software for the SSD (in my case in was Samsung Magician) and select options to tweak the OS for the SSD. At this point I also disabled indexing in C:  properties.3.) Optional: Upgrade the RAM to 4 or 8GB. Careful this RAM is PC3L (meaning low voltage - look it up) Crucial memory has good results according to the web. I bought normal voltage Corsair Vengance in hopes of tight timings and it didn't work (CMSX4GX3M1A1600C9). I have two beeps continuously as I sit here, but I'll fix that. The 2GB at the moment really isn't that bad after the SSD swap, nevertheless I'll put 4GB in.4.) Upgrade to windows 8.1 in the Store (Make sure windows is updated completely, first) Remove bloatware and trial antivirus, trial office, etc. Removed Dell backup and restore (preference)5.) Important! In trackpad properties next to clock under Gestures, Disable all three \"one finger gestures\". This caused lockups with the trackpad and might have led to a lot of complaints. That fixed it for me.6.) Make a cloned image to a USB drive of the completed SSD to \"factory restore\" when/if needed.Hopefully this helped somebody. The laptop works great with the above upgrades. Use less screen brightness if it's not necessary to get the 10+ hours. You'll also have a spare HD lying around if you upgraded to SSD.Only Con I have: keyboard is not illuminated. At least the laptop is touchscreen for night use. I also have a USB night light I can use if I need to use the keyboard in the dark bad enough.

This stood out because of the long battery life due to the new Haswell processor. I totally agree with the other reviews in that it is sluggish due to the poor RAM and low end processor. They should have put in the 4GB RAM and a small SSD would definitely stretch the poor multi-tasking ability of the processor. Loading programs, loading more complicated websites, and switching from one program to the other causes some lagging but once in programs like word and powerpoint it seems to do well. Another annoying thing is that my auto-connect to the wi-fi does not work, everytime I restart the computer it connects to my network but says no internet requiring me to disconnect and then re-connect which is REAL annoying and should not be an issue on a new computer like this. I will say I like the design and the textured plastic gives it a better feel than the average plastic laptops and the touch screen works well although the screen does not get very bright. The touchpad is also a bit sensitive but I have had worse touchpads than this for sure.Pros: nice design, long battery lifeCons: slow performance, lower end touchpad, wi-fi buggy, price high for what youAlthough the design is great and I think this product will still be useful for me, I cannot recommend to buy this.It would be nicer with more RAM and an SSD drive but by then you will spend a lot and there would be more options at that price anyways. I think other options give more bang for the buck, this just gives excellent battery life and design. I would tell a friend to wait for more Haswell low end laptops like this come out because you will probably find more value in another brand and still get the battery life.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid little portable laptop, overall", "Author": "Keith", "ReviewID": "R1UVJ3V6YFNJ54", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall I am happy with the purchase of this Dell laptop. I was in the market for an ultra portable computer and had ruled out Chromebooks due to the limited hard drive space in the newer models such as the Acer c720. My plan was to dual-boot any ultra portable I purchased with a Linux distro and the 16gb storage and somewhat awkward dual-booting process (\"developer mode\") required of a Chromebook turned me away. I currently have it running with Ubuntu 13.10 with a pretty customized setup to be more touchscreen friendly and upgraded to 4gb of ram.I picked up the Dell Inspiron 11 for $300 online from Officemax and consider that price to be about right. This model in particular stood out for me due to it having the Haswell Intel Celeron 2955u CPU, the same as in some recent Chromebooks. The low end has come a ways when compared to my old Acer netbooks and their Atom processors. The touchscreen was a bonus, not something I was holding out for at this price but fun to play around with.The Pros: Compared to the older Celeron processors, battery life is significantly improved. Portability is the number #1 purpose for a laptop like this (that and price...), so a great battery life was a must for me. The fact that it also charges pretty much from empty to full capacity in 2 hours or so is excellent. Not exactly sure what battery life I am getting, I have been doing a lot of installing and more intensive stuff since getting it but would say it meets the claims of 8ish hours.The processor with integrated graphics is very good for everyday purposes, quickly loading up 1080p Youtube videos without any issues. It is also completely capable of connecting over HDMI to my 1080p television and displaying at full resolution without issue. I have even been able to play some older PC games so long as the settings are realistic (low-medium). I have been playing TES IV: Oblivion on it at a lower widescreen resolution and low/medium settings with outdoor FPS at 35-50 and indoor FPS 40-60, dips more in crowded towns/cities. The Intel HD graphics (Intel HD 1000 4th gen) manage way better than I would have guessed! Didn't think it could pull it off, hadn't purchased it thinking it could manage any level of gaming, pleasantly surprised.I also think the build quality overall is pretty nice. I guess take that with a grain of salt as I have been using a 10 year business laptop up to now for my portable needs, so I am not too picky. I am more often a desktop user. But I find the look to be attractive for the price range and the feel to be solid. Held at the corner with a single hand while open, the Inspiron doesn't feel like it wants to snap in half from its own weight. The hinges are decently solid as well, pretty important for a touchscreen. Only time will tell how it all holds up.The Cons: The keyboard is OK. Not as bad as on my old Acer 11.6 netbook or my brothers monstrous Asus 17 inch laptop (amazingly bad keyboard). Same goes for the track pad, it isn't stellar. It gets you by for casual use but I need to use a wireless mouse for anything more longterm and productivity aimed. Same goes for the screen as well, it is just fine. None of these are all that shocking though for the price range and aren't entirely \"cons\".The biggest disappoint (as mentioned in various reviews) is the stock 2gb of RAM. Considering Windows 8 idles at around 1.1 - 1.2gb, that doesn't leave all that much RAM for you to use. Everything felt sluggish. If I had planned to ditch Windows 8 altogether and just use Linux, it probably would have worked fine enough (my Ubuntu setup idles around 300mb of RAM). But knowing I wanted to use Windows as well, the upgrade is pretty much mandatory in my mind. The 4gb was $40 well spent, used the same type of RAM as recommended by another reviewer without any issue. Has been proven to accept 8gb of ram but that felt like overkill for my purposes. B005LDLV6SFinal Verdict: Good little ultra portable laptop, better if you can get it for a lower price than the $380ish currently listed. But if you are holding out for the Haswell based Celeron CPU and its awesome battery life improvements, there aren't many options in this price range (yet).", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Good Laptop after a couple of upgrades", "Author": "Allen M.", "ReviewID": "R3OVKLYLG14VMJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this laptop because I needed an ultraportable notebook with decent processing power and this pretty much met my requirements with price and performance*Right out of the box the performance of this notebook is not as fast I expected so I did a couple of upgrades which pretty much made this notebook perform as fast computers 2-3x it's price and have not had one complaint since.For upgrades I did:Originally 2GB of RAM --> 8GB Crucial Low Voltage RAMOriginally 500GB HD --> 250GB Samsung EVO SSDBoth upgrades provide increased performance and battery life and have made this notebook an absolute value.I highly recommend this notebook after the upgrades above.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent choice for a daily use laptop if you're willing to make a couple upgrades", "Author": "Dave", "ReviewID": "RE08TF5D9M575", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "***Edit / Update: After extensive repair and troubleshooting the faulty touchpad, Dell replaced my unit and gave me the Pentium 3556U version of this Inspiron 3137 as a replacement.

I recommend spending the extra $ on it. Otherwise my original review below applies***PROS: +Perfect size; +Excellent build quality and great materials...no fingerprints!; +Nice screen; +Very good performance with a couple of upgrades; +Excellent online documentation & support; +Outstanding value proposition for a daily use laptop even considering cost of upgradesCONS:  -Glitchy touch pad; -Keyboard keys too small; -Performance out of the box leaves a bit to be desiredI purchased my Inspiron 1137 from Dell as a replacement for a three year-old similar Dell model, the 1121, which was an 11\" with a first gen Core i3 CPU. I loved the 1121 but it was starting to show its age physically with scuffs and it was bulky for an 11 incher.  Having loved that Dell, getting the 1137 was a no-brainer.Well, in a week of use, the 1137 is good, 'tho it is no 1121. It looks great - sleek and modern. The exterior and palm rest are all a grippy matte material - no fingerprints for once - thank you Dell. And the touch screen, even at the 1366x768 resolution, is gorgeous and works fine with an 11.6\"  screen.The island-style keyboard is somewhat hard to use, mainly because the keys are very small. Compared to my older 11\" Dell 1121, this keyboard is very hard to get used to. The keys feel good to the touch; it's their small size that hinders usability.  I've had no issues with the touch screen functionality.The one area I have had continual problems is the touch pad. And apparently I'm not alone, based on a long thread in the Dell Community forum, full of 1137 users who are losing their minds due to this erratic touch pad. The Synaptics driver Dell has published on their support site for this model is buggy to say the least. In fact, it's nearly impossible to use most of the time - the pointer freaks out and goes all over the place at the slightest touch; the scroll function does not work at all; and quite often both tap-to-click and regular click don't work. It works normally about 10% of the time. The easiest work-around is to use a mouse or the touch screen when able. I found a Dell Synaptics driver for another Dell model (XPS 9500) that seems to work fairly well, but beware - unless you're up for some serious troubleshooting, it seems that a lot of 1137 users have this touch pad problem.I will give kudos to Dell support. The documentation available online for the 1137 is excellent - a highly detailed user guide with instructions on how to upgrade or change out components, and a nicely detailed spec sheet. The support website is easy to use whether you're looking for drivers or the original software that came from the factory. And Dell's community forum is the best in the industry.  All of that is important if you choose to make the upgrades I mention below.Performance wise, out of the box I give the 1137 a fair rating. The Celeron 2955U CPU is pretty good. It benchmarks higher than the 1st gen Core i3 in my old Dell 1121, but in real-world use it seems more taxed. That's not to say it is slow; it's just not as fast.  Right after I ordered my 1137, after researching compatibility, I placed an order for a 128GB 2.5\" 7mm SSD and a 4GB stick of 1.35V DDR3 1600 RAM to upgrade the stock components. After doing the upgrades (which were easy), the performance of the unit immediately went up to very good. The SSD makes a huge improvement over the stock 5400RPM hard drive, and the 4GB vs 2GB of RAM allows apps to load quicker and lets more be open at once.  See the bottom of this review for my personal tips on SSD size and RAM amounts.Other usability/performance comments -- the sound is good for a small laptop; there wasn't any bloatware on my unit -- just Dell utilities such as \"MyDell\" and a webcam app; and, Dell actually included a recovery Windows 8 DVD. I was under the impression these were no longer included.My final comments are regarding Windows 8 and 8.1 and have no bearing in my evaluation of the laptop.  Windows 8 is awful. For a power user, Windows 8 adds at least one additional step -- if not two or three -- to access settings and do basic things that PC geeks like myself do.  I have completed the 8.1 upgrade; while it's a bit better, it's still burdensome. Yes, Windows 8 is gorgeous, and it performs great. In my opinion, there was too much emphasis put on making the OS pretty as opposed to functional. Such is life, and it's beyond our control at this point, unless switching to Mac or Ubuntu is an option - it isn't for me.While I am a bit let down by the 1137 when comparing it to a three year-old similarly spec'd system, I still give it a good rating. If Dell can resolve the glitchy touch pad issue, my rating would be very good. If you're willing to buy this and immediately spend another $150 on a SSD and 4GB of RAM, then this machine makes a great companion. It's sized perfectly for daily use, and performs well in everything except high-end gaming. In fact, I venture to say that even with the upgrades, the 1137 is a better value proposition than a higher-end $900-$1000 Ultrabook.(Tips: For those wondering if a 128GB SSD is big enough, consider this -- with Win 8/8.1 loaded and all the Dell software, Office Professional Plus, and a dozen or so other programs, I still have 75% of space available. I store almost all of my files on Dropbox so storage is not a huge issue.  And, for those wondering whether to go with 4GB or 8GB of RAM -- yes, the 1137 supports one 8GB 1.35V stick of RAM, but 4GB along with a SSD is the sweet spot and the best value in my opinion. I had an 8GB stick in my older Dell 1121 and there wasn't much of a noticeable difference between 4GB and 8GB. With RAM prices up there, I think 8GB for this model is overkill, even for a power user. Hope this helps)RE: Windows 7 -- I have installed Win 7 64 bit on this unit and have it working fine. The one driver that may cause issues is the Dell Wireless 1705 card... If you go that route, make sure to download and install the \"Dell System Software\" prior to the Wireless 1705 driver.

Then this Inspiron 3137 went on sale for the same price and so I did both a comparison. Both devices had the same processor and 2gb of RAM. Same screen size, just about the same weight, Dell is about a few ounces heavier but still lightweight. The difference was in OS (Win 8 vs Chrome OS) and storage (32 gb SDD vs 500gb HDD).  The deciding factor was that other reviews commented how  it was relatively easy to upgrade the ram and switching to Solid state drive.UPGRADING: Kudos to Dell for making it easy to open the back and swap out hardware. Make sure you do your research before attempting, a small screw drive is really helpful, and as soon as you open the back panel say good bye to your warranty.Ram has fairly easy. I got a Crossair 8bg single stick 1.35v DDR3 1600 MT/s  and yes it works.SSD was a little more tricky. Either clone the hard drive and or what did. I knew someone who had Win 8.1 pro and did a fresh install. Plus side it was bloatware free, but it take up sometime to install all the drivers needed. Dell makes easy to get but some of the driver on the site was not updated/optimized for Win 8.1, so I had to get creative. Might be taxing for some but I am use to dealing with Windows/PC. Took a lot of time and effort but I got this Dell customized to how I want it.After upgrades + 2 weeks use:I using this Dell right now to type up this review. So far everything is working as I expected. The upgrades really boosted the performance and battery life. Boot-up time is about 10-20 seconds. Battery life is about 8-10 hours depending on use and screen brightness. Takes about 2 hours to charge more or less. Easy to carry and easy to hold. Relatively quite. I can barely hear the fan. it's been sitting on my lap for about an hour. The vents are in the bottom and behind the screen hinge. It's only slightly warm, but I not reallyThe keyboard is rather compact but it is easy to type with and comfortable especially with some with big hands like me. It's not back-lit, but that's not a really deal breaker for me. If anything I can use the on-screen touch keyboard. The touch screen is responsive, but I am not accustomed to using it much. I kinda old school so I use the track pad or if possible a mouse. The track is decent and sometimes a pain. Apple/Macs are still the best in the market for right now. Some of issue were part hardware design and partly software. Some effort is need to calibrate and tweak the track pad settings.Built quality is better than expected considering the price. Nice brush metal finish on the outer part, and the inside is compose of high quality plastic. The hinge feels solid and sturdy, even after opening up the back panel. The touch screen is either light weight glass or plastic. Not really sure but it's decent. Finger prints are not to noticeable, and easy to clean. Resolution is not super HD quality, but passable. Viewing angles are okay, but I have not used this outdoor or in direct sunlight. Down side is that there is a thick bezel around the screen that reduces viewing real estate.Overall:This was $299 Amazon and add $200 in upgrades is this about a $500 notebook. It works well as for my needs. I work and go to school in San Francisco, so this is a good balance between performance and mobility. I am satisfied with my purchase.

I did this at like 11 pm on a Tuesday, went to their call center in India (who seems to speak English surprisingly well) and finished it all by 12 am.Great purchase, really cheap for a top rate computer!! plus the battery seems to last forever", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome", "Author": "Patrick", "ReviewID": "R36XWSAQY9RITN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very nice computer (just keep out WIn 8) and it is faster than computer like HP or lenovo, :), i like it", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product.", "Author": "Austin Broadhead", "ReviewID": "R35MP7LPXZV5W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a 16 year old who was looking for something mainly for painting on and facebook and videogames. at first I was looking for a convertible laptop/tablet that could separate like the asus t100 or Samsung ativ 500t. but after reading a lot of their reviews about keyboard connection problems I decided that the technology was too new to give you a quality laptop and tablet in one. so I decided to start looking at touchscreen laptops instead and found this on a great sale. I've had it for about a month now with no problems to report. I really like it and take it everywhere because its just so portable. I really like the texture of it too. its almost rubberized and feels really nice. I thought it would be a pain using a touchscreen with a keyboard but it feels so natural now and I wouldn't have it any other way. I also am able to run games that require more RAM and higher processor than this has like Dota 2 and Overlord. I am going to upgrade the RAM just to get some extra  power for gaming, but its definitely not absolutely necessary like some people say.

I bought this laptop because it was cheap and it has a respectable amount of space to store my music and important documents. So far I'm very pleased with my purchase. Initially it ran pretty slow which was to be expected as I was downloading apps for the Windows 8 Start page. The touchscreen isn't overly sensitive which I like. The laptop is very light which makes it easy to carry anywhere you go. The biggest con for me was adjusting to Windows 8 which really doesn't effect my opinion of the laptop as a whole. I just needed a little time to adjust to a software I am not familiar with. I did appreciate the fact that the start page did come with somewhat of a tutorial for those like me who are new to Windows 8. What more can I say?

Since receiving it and being on line with dell for over 12 hours, I found that this laptop is extremely poor designed.

I would not recommend this laptop to anyone.  the mouse touchpad is frequently lagging or unresponsive and the system frequently goes into a freeze state which may last anywhere from 10-30 seconds at a time.  there are no hardware faults so I suspect this is strictly a bad design.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FEE7D1Q"}}
