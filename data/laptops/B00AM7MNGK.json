After just 3 months, my computer would overheat to the point of automatically shutting off. I've had to take it apart, pull the heat sink off the CPU, only to find that there was almost no thermal paste, and what was left had the consistency of dried out gum. Also, the heat sink makes an arc, passing from the CPU over the graphics card part of the motherboard. The heat from the CPU just gets passed on to the graphics card, so my GPU is always about 15 to 20 degrees hotter than the CPU, which gets up to 80 degrees with just internet browsing! Horrible design.Also, the battery dies after 2 months. What's the point of having a laptop that you have to haul around the power cord or else it dies after 5 minutes?Dell lies about battery life. They said it would last 6 hours light use, 4-5 hours moderate use, and 3 hours with heavy use like gaming. Lie. When I first bought it, it lasted 1 hour with heavy use and 2.5 hours with light use. Then, like I said, the battery completely died after 2 months.Never buy a dell, period. This is not a one off situation. Search the internet about dell overheating and dell skimping on hardware. You'll find lots of results.Also do a search on how horrible their customer service is.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Received wrong model", "Author": "H.

Because I had gone through 2 exchanges previously, and needed my laptop, I kept it, and amazon did compensate me for the difference in value.  The laptop (5521) has similar specs to the 4146, and has performed well.  It has a Windows 8 rating around 6 (out of 10).  I was able to install office, and photoshop and it didn't seem to hang when using both simultaneously.  I was not able to install a game, it errored out when attempting to start it (attempted 10+ times even with a different product key, and just a no go).  Doesn't really matter since my purpose for this laptop is for school and personal business.  Not much bloatware, install of OS and initial set up went well, as did my removal of McAfee and installation of Norton.", "Date": "April 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is this Touch Screen?", "Author": "Caitlin", "ReviewID": "R3HMA8AF5GM0WW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been doing research on this product, and I've been trying to locate the Touch Screen one, like on dell.com, and this is one that came up, but it doesn't specifically say \"touch screen,\" so does that mean it's not?
