It has not been exposed to extremes of temperature and has not been dropped or otherwise subjected to abuse.It has wireless access to our Ethernet network and provides the flexibility we desired when we bought it.

I replaced it for free near the end of my warranty.I'm running dual boot:Windows XP / Linux Mint 9 LXDEI spend more time in Linux Mint 9 LXDE than I do in Windows.When I'm not in Linux Mint 9 LXDE, I'm either test booting Linux Distros from CD / DVD, using Sun VirtualBox to boot test downloaded ISOs, or creating or booting from Linux USB.I've run just about every version of Ubuntu from version 9 up to / through version 10, Linux Mint (HIGHLY recommended - light on resources, user friendly): CrunchBang, Knoppix, Fedora 14, Puppy Linux, GeexBox, ZorinOS, Back-Box (Network Diagnostics, Network Security Toolkit also run without a hitch.It has problems with Gnome 3.0 / Unity, and the latest versions (11.*) of Ubuntu as well as running 3D graphics or for that matter HD video.But, for my purposes: Internet Connectiity, Basic Application access (Word Processor, Spreadsheet, Graphics, Audio / Video) LibreOffice, VLC, Audacity, Gnome MediaPlayer, ImageViewer, Feh, FSLint (for cleanup), Ubuntu Tweak, BleachBit (Cleanup / Config tools).

The D830's battery charging light located in the LED strip below the monitor (but visible with the lid open or closed) flashes four times RED and once GREEN to indicate a bad battery. There is NO way I have discovered to turn this off, so I ended up having to cover the light with black tape! Battery life is now down to one hour from three. I can't bring myself to replace it yet. I've knocked a star off my rating for receiving a battery with such a short lifespan and a laptop with such an annoying, incessant light (likely intending to bug you until you buy the Dell replacement).[original review]-THE SELLER-I purchased a Dell D830 from Tampa-Laptops in Refurbished condition for $228 and have had this for less than a month. The laptop arrived very quickly in adequate, bubble-wrapped packaging in a Priority Mail box. Also included was the AC adapter and a genuine Windows 7 CD for refurbished PCs. Activation sticker for this new version was also attached to the bottom. Laptop was exactly as described by seller. Remember to read the comments by the sellers on the offer listing page before making a decision! Their comments supercede any info on the main item page.Note that if you buy this laptop with a clean install of Windows (7 in this case), remember that no software besides Internet Explorer is installed (unless otherwise stated) and you may need drivers yourself. I needed to install a universal graphics driver from NVIDIA and a mouse driver from Dell's support website for enhanced functionality with the trackpoint and pad.-THE LAPTOP-My Dell D830 15.4\" is equipped with a 2.2GHz Intel Core2Duo processor, 2 GBs of installed memory and a 90 GB hard drive. The build quality of Dell's business-oriented Latitute line from this era I believe is quite good. I already own a Dell D620 14.1\" laptop that I like and wanted to stick with what I knew but was also looking for a desktop replacement. The most noticeable difference between the two, besides the size and weight difference, is that the D830 is MUCH quieter. The larger cooling system doesn't run at full speed except under full processing power and even then it isn't as noisy. The D620 runs at full speed with a higher pitched whine at all times. Even the Logitech N200 cooling pad cuts its down by only a little. The D830 is an update to the Dx20 Latitute line, so perhaps that specific issue was addressed.The keyboard is \"clackier\" than the quiet D620's, but I'm getting used to it. The speakers on the D830 are larger and placed to either side of the keyboard resulting in superior sound (but still no bass). The trackpoint was essential for me, although as a desktop replacement I more often use an external USB mouse. The display is bright and inviting; the brightness automatically dims when on battery power (customizable in BIOS and anytime with special keystrokes). The D830 cannot compare to the processing power in newer PCs, but this is the fastest system I have ever owned. Even though it was not designed for Windows 7 I find it zippy for all my normal browsing/streaming tasks. Battery life is a surprising 3+ hours right now. Note that I have not attempted use of demanding software and the D830 is not for 3D gaming.So far I am very pleased with this purchase.", "Date": "August 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "This is goood.", "Author": "H.

I said no then they sent this request. 2nd \"If you return this computer for a full refund including shipping, will you agree to a retraction of your feedback?\"  I said I would but then the Loyalty Business Solutions came back with additional obstacles to their refunding of the cost. 3rd.  Send the laptop back but no return postage offer, 4th hold off on sending the laptop back.

Musa \"Whisky Cat\"", "ReviewID": "R3JCG8KLTZ3EE7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "so this is the same computer as I have had, cept not broken... emphasis on the NOT part.  I purchased this computer to replace one I had which was on its death bed.  this was about 170 (prices vary on amazon I know, but bear with me).  I was soon made  aware the comp I had was more customized than what traditional rolled out of dells doors.  the screen was not the best, the finger print biometrics scanner was not part of the one I received, and it wasn't as fast.  The video card was also not Nvidia, it was Intel which on this model was notorious for kicking out at times which were most inopportune.So I needed it for class and it was 170 dollars, cant really beat that price, so I am using it to write this now.  you can watch some movies on it, play low graphics games if you choose I guess, but it isn't an all out comp, just a decent working comp.  so if that is what you need hunt for a great price on it.my only gripe is that the computer didn't have the biometrics scanner, I had asked specificaly about that when ordering, and the seller said \"yes we will find one with that option and send it\" as some of their pictures included models with the biometrics.  I didn't get one, but they did send an extra battery and a long extension cord... so minus one star for that.  minus another star for the pixels of the screen, they sold me one with the lowest resolution screen.ONE major PLUS is that this model is what you might call \"out dated\", and considered so by Dell.  But because of this, simply going to Dell's main page and looking up this computer lets you have access to the protocols for customizing and maintaining it that are probably the very same ones given to dell employees when you sent yours into get repaired.  Soooo... if you are looking for a computer that offers some customizable options, ease of customization, and a plethora of custom and spare parts in the on line market, then again, search for a decent price like I did and nab one.:) happy hunting", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "great for the price", "Author": "harshi", "ReviewID": "RUNEASRBO6J6T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i bought this last week and it's worth for the money spent, I like it ,  i would recommend to anyone", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "muchas estoy muy satisfecho por mi compra", "Author": "daniel urdaneta", "ReviewID": "R3636JJU4ABVPQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "muy agradecido x el buen trato y la buena experiencia en la compra de mis  equipo muchas gracias los felicito", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only a couple minor problems", "Author": "David Thompson", "ReviewID": "RU8KMGV1XNGOD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I gave a 4 because there was a couple minor problems one of which I believe could have been dealt with by the seller, but having said that, overall my experience has been good, I am actually using the product to give this review.
