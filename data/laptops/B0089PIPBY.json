{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good basic notebook with a vivid color screen", "Author": "iiiiReader", "ReviewID": "R24DTUSIPK1JFN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Sony Vaio SVF1421ACXW is a stylish basic notebook at a good price. The notebook is relatively thin and light, and it has excellent vibrant Sony quality colors on the 14 inch 1600x900 screen.  The notebook uses the recently released Intel Pentium 2117U, dual core processor which makes it a great starter notebook, or replacement for someone that does not have high end gaming requirements.  It is about twice the speed of the previous basic low end Dell notebook we bought just a few months ago.  This notebook will handle any normal  web surfing, skyping, video viewing, word processing or other activities an average user would expect to perform.When the notebook boots up for the very first time, the keyboard back lighting is turned on.  When I booted this notebook, because of the bright sunlight from outside, the back lighting made it very hard to read the keys.  I easily fixed that by turning off the keyboard back lighting once the machine was set up, and I have turned it back on again.  I have noticed that the touchpad seems a bit squishy when moving the mouse cursor, and very sensitive as compared to the touchpad on my other computer, a MacBook. I have to be careful when using the touchpad on this notebook, otherwise, because it is sensitive, it wants to send unwanted mouse clicks.  If I could give a 4.5 star, I would due to the touchpad issue; otherwise, the notebook is five star.The notebook does not have a touch screen, which means that it is harder to run Windows 8 Apps, but that does not bother me because I have no plans to run Windows 8 Apps.  When I installed the machine the default setup screens prompted me to create a Login account using my email address and to sign up for the Windows App store.  I declined those choices and instead chose to do a custom setup.  In the custom setup I declined all the Windows App Store services, and I clicked on a button in the lower right of the screen to create a Local Login account, which is the same type of login as on previous Windows releases.Personally, I am not a fan of Windows 8, but immediately after I setup the note book, I found the Desktop tile on the Windows 8 start screen, and clicked into it.  From there I installed an application called Classic Shell, which gives Windows 8  a start button and also makes the Windows 8 behave very similar to Windows 7.  This program hides the Windows 8 tile start screen, brings back the normal windows screen each time the machine boots, and generally makes Windows 8 behave similar to Windows 7.In summary, if you are looking for a good basic notebook such as a first school notebook or perhaps as a gift to someone who is not a teenage video game playing fanatic, this notebook should definitely be considered.  It will not disappoint.", "Date": "August 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't buy this!", "Author": "Carolyn Cooperider", "ReviewID": "R2BTXRVVMPHQP1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I owned my new unit for about two months when I noticed a flaw/slice in the metal where the ports are located.  I called customer service and was told to bring the VAIO to any UPS store so it could be sent in for repair.  I packed the VAIO in its original packaging.  As it was so new and in otherwise pristine condition, I was expecting SONY would replace this flawed laptop with a new one.  Instead, the VAIO came back with NEW damage in the form of scraped paint, marred finish and scratches.  Obviously, it was repaired with a used, damaged piece and no quality control check was done before it was sent back to me.  I had to send it back again for fresh repairs to damage that SONY caused.  SONY had discarded my original packaging materials and refused to supply a new, replacement box, keyboard guard or foam sleeve. Without the original packaging, I now won't get as high a price when I sell it on E-Bay. I was not given clear instructions from SONY customer service about how to send the unit back other than to take it to any UPS store.  I had to initiate all contact with the company regarding this matter. SONY no longer offers superior customer service.  You would be wise to select another brand.

I was debating on if I should pay the extra money for the touchscreen or not. I convinced myself that it was necessary and went ahead and ordered this one... The laptop is great! Very quiet, runs smooth! This version is very basic so it is not the fastest laptop around, but fast enough for students or maybe a stay at home parent like myself who goes to school online. The backlit keyboard is now an important part in my laptop life because it allows me to type at night with ease without having to hunch over to see the keys. Now the real stuff! Windows 8 is absolutely horrible... I hate this system, and I consider myself a little tech savy! The lack of a touchscreen makes it difficult to navigate around those darn tickers, and many times I have found myself stuck in the camera or something with no way out cause there isn't an x button and esc does not work either. So I will probably return this for the added touchscreen. But if you can get past the lack of a touchscreen for windows 8, you will really like this laptop! I think it's a winner well minus windows 8!", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great everyday laptop", "Author": "Wixby Bonnet", "ReviewID": "R36ZQOA9HLPL0X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been quite happy with the Sony VAIO for my basic computer needs when I don't want to be stuck at a desk top. The initial set up was just as easy as any other computer I've ever done. The battery life allows for approximately four hours of use from my experience. The screen resolution is good for the regular internet email and browsing, and the simple processing type work I do on it.The laptop is a nice size and not bulky. It is fairly thin with rounded edges and fits easily into bags, backpacks and carryon luggage. It is also quite light and easy to carry around. It's noticeably lighter than my Dell Latitude.There are just a couple of things I don't like about it. One is the touch pad. It seems cheap. It just feels like it's not good quality while I'm using it. The main complaint I have though doesn't specifically have to do with the computer. The operating system the VAIO comes with is Windows 8. This is my first time using it and the only computer on which I run Windows 8. I don't like it so far, but I am getting used to it. Most likely though, in a few months I'll be just as comfortable as I have been with previous versions of Windows.Overall, this computer does what I need it do and performs well.", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor battery supply.", "Author": "raymore", "ReviewID": "R3MX4ZYCA452EJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The battery in the unit I purchased only lasts less than 4 hours.

I've borrowed quite a few and even rented one for a while, but this is actually my first laptop. I work at home and had convinced myself that my sanity would last longer if I drew an invisible line between my home office and the rest of the house. I was afraid that if I had access to a computer elsewhere (on the couch, for example), I'd never leave computing and the Internet behind--and I'm fast discovering there is a certain amount of truth in that. I've only had this Sony laptop for a month and I'm already getting addicted to having a go-anywhere computer.OK, so, about this computer. My primary computer is a Mac tower and I have always been a Mac person at home. I have taught Photoshop to adults, however, and had to use Windows machines in that setting; I had no choice since the lab at the school was all PC. I was (and remain) a bit apprehensive about using a Windows machine--but I'm going to leave out my comments about that OS since it has nothing to do with the computer. The software is a Microsoft product and, for surfing the web and writing, I'll get used to it regardless of how bad the reviews for it are (and wow, do some people get hot about Windows 8!). (I have to say that, for me at least, Macs are far superior in every way--though some aspects of Windows are much better these days.)I do, however, have many good things to say about this computer as a piece of hardware. First, the screen is fantastic. This is a brilliant, sharp and very clean-looking screen and the glare is far lower that I would have expected. I have not installed Photoshop on it (I will shortly) and so can't speak much to the accuracy of the colors yet, but I will update this review when I get that software installed and begin to work with photographs (I will probably just get Elements for this since I have the full version on my Mac).Also, the keyboard: what a great keyboard--in both feel and looks. Seriously, half the reason I've avoided getting a laptop (even a Macbook) is because I hate most smaller keyboards. This is a full-sized keyboard and it's got a really solid feel. It is a nice solid good click kind of keyboard and, since I'm writing primarily, that is very important. The trackpad seems fine, but doing Photoshop via trackpad--I don't see that happening. Mouse, here I come. Also, this keyboard is backlit--and it's very bright. You can literally sit in a dark room and write and surf and the keyboard is more than bright enough. I had no idea an illuminated keyboard could be this nice.The computer does seem like it drags a bit in starting up (from a cold start) and I find that bit annoying--but it's so new to me that perhaps I'll figure out a mode that jumpstarts it faster.  I considered getting the touch screen and I still ponder that decision, but for now I don't really miss it and I'm honestly glad to be looking at a clean screen. In operation, the computer seems plenty fast enough, but I'm not really pressing it to do any hard work yet--again, I've had it less than a month. I also don't yet know if 4GB of RAM is fast enough to do Photoshop (particularly on large RAW files), so I will probably add the other 4GB of RAM and max it out. I like that the computer has an SD slot so that I can download photo files in the field and also that it has an HDMI port so that I can review photos on other screens without having to download them to a second computer, or so that I can review them on a good TV (some hotel TVs now have HDMI also, which is great).Finally, I've read some of the other reviews here about the Wifi speeds and so far I'm only experimenting with it, so I'm no expert and it does seem slow to me (and at times it just drops out). But I've been having some cable issues lately, so I'm not going to blame the computer-yet. To be honest, I've also used it hardwired to the modem more than I've used it wirelessly so far (though that will change). When it is wireless I'm using it with a Cable modem and a TP-Link TP-LINK TL-WDR3500 Wireless N600 Dual Band Router, 2.4GHz 300Mbps+5Ghz 300Mbps, USB port,  IP QoS, Wireless On/Off Switch router and so I'm not yet sure if speed issues trace back to the router or to the laptop itself (or to the cable, though I think I've solved that issue). I have a LAN person/friend coming over this weekend to go through this with me and I will update this review once I'm sure that it's operating at its top speed--and then I'll comment on that speed. I wish the other reviewers who talked about the Wifi problems had discussed them more at length.For now, I'm more than happy with the screen, the keyboard and the 500 gig drive. I also recently bought a WD My Passport 1TB Portable External Hard Drive Storage USB 3.0 Black and I'm hoping that it's as reliable as the WD drive I bought for my Mac tower--a great and totally plug-and-play drive.I think Windows is a complex and backward system in a lot of ways and after 20 years on Macs, it's hard to change. But so far I have to say Sony did a pretty good job of designing a nice lightweight laptop.
