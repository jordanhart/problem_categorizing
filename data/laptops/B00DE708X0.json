{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very fast and effective laptop.", "Author": "rsjiii \"bobby\"", "ReviewID": "R1H1TSR1V26QNB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a fast and well conceived laptop.  The touch screen is smooth and very helpful especially for reading documents or just scrolling through websites.  The SSD drive is much faster than anything else, obviously.  For me, it came down to this high end ENVY vs a high end mac book pro.  (same processor).  I saved the 1000 dollars and gained the touchscreen.  However, the interaction between touch screen and mouse pad is definitely glitchie.  No crashes yet but there are times where one or the other just freezes.  I am hoping they will work these problems out in future HP updates.  Overall, I would recommend this computer but still wonder if I should bought a mac.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not working and no HP support", "Author": "Gunter Guckel \"Northeast Cape Man\"", "ReviewID": "R36UD0RAAKYJRS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The laptop arrived well enough but while building the Microsoft profile there was an interruption and upon resuming I got the error message \"Profile Cannot Be Loaded.\"  Since the laptop comes without any media and no DVD drive, I am unable to recover.  I called Microsoft and HP for support.  Microsoft didn't want to know and told me to call HP.  After getting shuffled around from telephone number to telephone number, being asked each time the same questions over and over again, I reached Jason in the Philippines.  After trying every function key combination possible and then some, it was determined that I needed to recover the system.  HP promised to send me USB recovery software.  This all happened around midnight on August 8.  I was promised 1 day shipping.  Well, four days later I am down and waiting.  I called HP and was told that the recovery software would not ship till August 18.  The blame being put on FedEx and the approaching typhoon.My experience with HP, be it the iPaq, the LX6XX handheld or any of their PCs, has ben that nothing ever works quite right and HP abandons you.To anyone who reads this - do NOT buy any ENVY laptop from HP - try Dell, Toshiba, Lenovo or Acer and you'll probably have less grief and not have to fumble around with the very small function keys of the ENVY.", "Date": "August 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$3,145.00", "Features": "Intel Core i7-4900MQ 4th gen Quad processor at 2.80GHz with TURBO BOOST to 3.80GHz (EXTREME-power processor)\nSUPERFAST 256GB SSD and 1 TB (1256 GB total) Hard Drive; 16 GB of RAM\n15.6\" TOUCHSCREEN LED display; 4-speakers BEATS Audio; ULTRA SLIM Lightweight design\nHP TrueVision HD Webcam with mic; Fingerprint Reader; Natural Silver\n4 SuperSpeed USB 3.0; 1 HDMI; 1 VGA; 1 Ethernet; WiFi 802.11b/g/n; 1 headphone-out/microphone-in combo", "Name": "HP ENVY 15 TouchSmart Notebook 256GB SSD + 1 TB 16GB RAM (Intel Core i7-4900MQ 4th generation Quad Processor - 2.80GHz with TURBO BOOST to 3.80GHz, 16 GB RAM, 256GB SSD and 1 TB Hard Drive 1256 GB total, BEATS AUDIO, 15.6\" TOUCHSCREEN display, Windows 8) Ultra Slim TOUCH Laptop PC", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/412z1Qc8uTL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00DE708X0"}}
