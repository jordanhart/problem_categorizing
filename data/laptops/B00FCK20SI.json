{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WARNING:  Do NOT use \"Express Setup\" - use only \"CUSTOM Setup\"", "Author": "D. Cushman", "ReviewID": "R2K74IJ4FESS1T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Go ahead and read the 1-star reviews first, then come back and read THIS review, and you will quickly see that the problems the complainers are experiencing is because THEY WON'T READ AND FOLLOW SIMPLE DIRECTIONS, so the problems they describe are their own fault.  Those who followed simple directions gave the laptop 5 stars.People will throw away 100+ hours every month watching mindless television programs, but they won't invest just a few hours of their TV-watching life to learn how to use a computer.  Instead, they want manufacturers to make idiot-proof software so they don't have to actually READ (God forbid they might have to sacrifice an episode of some mindless television program), and if the manufacturer doesn't assist in enabling those people, then the manufacturer is vilified for not making moron-proof products.  Furthermore, those same people want the manufacturer to develop a laptop with the performance of a $1,200 unit, yet they want to pay less than $300 for that laptop! ....go figure.Ya just can't fix stupid.But take the experience of the complainers and be warned....when you first open and launch Windows 8, you will be presented with the option to select EXPRESS Setup or CUSTOM Setup.  If you do as all the nay-sayers did, and you mistakenly select Express Setup, you WILL have a slow-running laptop on your hands that constantly updates itself and throws popups at you.  However, if you wisely select CUSTOM Setup, you can easily disable all the unnecessary background apps that are not required for Windows 8 to run, and you will have a quick and fast little laptop like all of us that gave it 4 and 5 stars.  Don't be intimidated by the setup process.  Microsoft has made it fairly idiot-proof.  Keep reading....I've owned several different laptops over the years (Dell, HP, Lenovo and Sony brands), and I can confidently say this is a GREAT little laptop.  I wanted to get something small and compact for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas, but since most of the websites she visits require Flash, that immediately disqualified  anything with Chrome OS, Apple iOS, and Android OS.  So I wanted to find a small laptop with Windows OS as well as MS Office and a touchscreen.  When I found this laptop in December 2013, I was excited because it offers so much for so little.  However, I was skeptical because it was brand new to market and as of 12-15-2013, there were almost NO reviews out there I could rely on.  However, I invested 2 hours on this laptop before packaging it and handing it over to my daughter for Christmas, and I can confidently give this little beast 2 thumbs up.It IS very small - perfect for a young kid, teen or college student with small hands.  It is NOT for someone with large hands or bad vision (the small screen really shrinks everything down).  However, it's perfect for fitting right into a purse or backpack, and it comes with MS Office which is perfect for students (more on the MS Office installation further down in this review).  It's very thin, very lightweight, durable, and very compact.  It has a quality build to it - not cheap and flimsy.  My daughter already dropped it from 3 feet off the floor and it didn't crack or dent, and the hard drive wasn't affected in the least.BUT REMEMBER THE WARNING YOU MUST HEED:  when you power it up, you will be taken through a series of Windows 8 setup processes before you can use it, as well as setting up a personal Microsoft account (don't worry, no money or credit card required.  This is where the nay-sayers all went wrong.  I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to NOT select \"Express Settings\".  If you do, you WILL regret it.  There are a great deal of background apps and services that are defaulted to launch on Startup and constantly seek updates (including Windows itself).  Due to limited processing speed and memory on this laptop (in order for HP to sell it for $300 or under), all those apps running in the background will result in slow operation and response times. However, if you choose the Custom setup process, you can disable many unnecessary processes and updates that are not needed to run Windows 8.  I also advise NOT to set Windows to Automatic Updates.  You can manually update Windows yourself (I usually do this once a month).  Those processes are still available whenever you want them - but they do NOT need to automatically load and run in the background each time you start this laptop, so disable all the unnecessary apps and set them to manual.  If you choose Custom Setup, you will be walked right through this process and it's easy to complete.  But if you choose Express Setup, you will be defaulting them to run automatically on startup which is going to place a lot of unnecessary demand on the processor and memory, slowing the machine down and resulting in negative reviews, when in fact the problem is the user, not the laptop.  Simply disable the services that aren't required to run on Startup and it'll be quick and responsive.Sidebar:  I note that several of those who 1-star'd the laptop are claiming they selected Custom setup and still experience slow response from the laptop.  Okay, pay attention, please...... recall I said earlier \"ya can't fix stupid\".  That being said, even though you select Custom Setup, you still have to manually go through each and every option listed and you must DISABLE all those unnecessary apps!  You cannot simply select Custom Setup and then simply click Next, Next, Next on the prompt screens!  All that accomplishes is the same as selecting Express Setup, because all those unnecessary apps are still left running in the background.  I realize I'm stating the obvious here, but apparently stupidity runs rampant and knows no bounds, hence all the silly warning signs you now find on every product you buy (so as to protect people against their own stupidity).Here's another VERY important step:Once you have completed the Windows 8 setup process, you will need to open Internet Explorer, select Tools, and select Windows Update.  Even though Windows 8.1 comes installed on this laptop, there are dozens of new updates coming out all the time.  That process alone could take from 10 to 45 minutes to complete all necessary updates.  Once done, my advice is to go back into Control Panel and turn Windows Automatic Updates OFF.  Ignore all the dire warnings it will throw at you. You can manually update Windows anytime you want to.  There is no need to have all these processes always running in the background and taking up valuable processor and memory resources.  And don't forget to download and install Flash.  Plan on 2 hours to complete ALL setup steps and learning to add/remove/relocate apps on the new Windows 8 Start screen, as well as configuring the laptop to run only necessary Windows processes.  It's a bit time consuming but well worth the time invested.  If you choose to simply hit \"Express\" settings, then you'll be one of the unhappy reviewers like a few others here.  However, if you take my advice and select the custom manual setup and disable all those unnecessary apps, then you'll find it runs quick and you'll be quite happy with it.While others complained about Windows 8, I was impressed with the number of user-controlled settings that Windows is providing with this new OS, and the new tiled apps with a touchscreen are pretty cool.  The new Start Screen and tiles are new and different, but like anything that needs to be learned, I found it to have a lot of features I really liked.  You can add and remove tiles to your start screen, organize the tiles into groups, name the groups, etc.HP has created a website that teaches you everything you need to know to use Windows 8. At the bottom of this review, go to the Comments and click on page 2 where you will find the URL address that you can cut and paste into your browser.The touchscreen of this little laptop really impressed me.  I expected it to be a bit inaccurate and unresponsive like so many smartphone touchscreens are, but in fact it is VERY responsive and accurate, down to the tiniest little box to be checked with your finger.Picture quality of the screen is not high definition, but it's normal, and since it's a 10-inch screen, high definition detail cannot be seen anyway.  However, it does have a High Definition port to connect to a large HD monitor or television, and others have reported excellent video quality when connected to a TV screen or external monitor.  Video quality on the laptop itself is perfectly fine otherwise.Someone else mentioned slowness in streaming videos, but since I have a high broadband internet connection, I found that videos loaded fast and were absolutely flawless with no buffering or delay.  So that user's problem was NOT the laptop, it was her own limited broadband.The sound system on this laptop also impressed me.  It even comes with a built-in sound equalizer to customize sound to your personal tastes.If you're a hardcore online gamer, you are NOT going to be very happy with the AMD 1 Ghz processor, but then again, this laptop was not designed for heavy duty online gaming, and you can't expect an Intel i7 hyper-threading processor in a laptop under $300. You wouldn't reasonably expect to buy a little car with a 1.5 liter engine and then complain that it doesn't go from 0 to 60 mph in 4.5 seconds, right?  Understand that in order for HP to make this a low-priced $300 laptop, they had to put only 2 GB of memory in it and a simple AMD 1Ghz processor. For heavy online gamers or for running resource-intensive programs, this laptop is not sufficient. However, for normal everyday interactive gaming websites and other operating functionality for 90% of most people, it's great.  My daughter has had NO trouble at all, even with 3 different web browsers open (Firefox, Chrome and IE) and 4 other offline applications running simultaneously.  When launching apps, there is a slight delay of a few seconds, but otherwise the 1 Ghz AMD Processor speed and 2 GB RAM is fine for all applications.  If you want faster response and the ability to run programs or gaming software that puts heavy demand on the processor and memory, then you'll need to step up to a laptop in the range of $500 to $1,000.  But for basic computing, this laptop performs wonderfully.The speed and motion of the touchpad mouse is completely adjustable in the Control Panel, so the people that claim the touchpad is slow and unresponsive are simply proving my point that the nay-sayers are those that have not taken a few minutes of time to adjust and control all the various settings a computer or laptop makes available to users.  When you get into a car rental or someone else's car, you have to adjust the seat and mirrors to fit YOU so it's comfortable for YOU, right? Well, in like manner, on any laptop you need to adjust the touchpad to respond to your own touch and speed preference.  It's silly to simply accept the default settings and then complain about it!  If you don't know how to do something on any laptop or PC, just remember:  Google is your friend....Use it!  Everything and anything you want to learn is available at your fingertips through a simple Google search.  I often use Youtube to watch quick How-To videos to learn anything I need to know.I took 2 hours to complete all updates and adjust various settings and configurations before gifting it to my daughter, and this laptop works GREAT.  For anything I didn't know how to do on Windows 8.1, I simply Googled the question and found dozens of immediate How-To's.  Once I was done, I found the laptop to be fast and responsive with a LOT of functionality and excellent build quality.Oh, by the way:  When you open the box, there is a small yellow card with your MS Office activation code.  Do NOT throw it away!  You will need that activation code when you launch Office 2013 that comes pre-installed on this laptop.  It is Office Home and Student 2013, so it only includes Word, Excel and PowerPoint (it does NOT include Access, Publisher, Outlook or SharePoint), but the version this comes with is a FULL version for you to keep.  It is NOT a trial version.  To me, that makes this laptop a remarkable buy, because Office Home & Student 2013 is a $100 program, so considering the HP build quality, the touchscreen, a decent amount of processor speed and memory, as well as having Windows 8.1 fully installed (no upgrade required), that makes this $300 laptop the number one bargain laptop to be found anywhere in 2014. PERIOD.  You can find cheaper ones, but they won't even begin to compare to this one.All in all, I am absolutely amazed at how much value this laptop offers for such a low price and with excellent build quality.  I challenge anyone to find a laptop for under $300 that compares to this one.  Go ahead and search away, you will not find another laptop in this price range that has all this unit offers with the build quality of HP.  I find it to be THE best bargain in it's class.  And that's important to remember:  You're looking at a $300 laptop, so don't expect it to have 8 GB of memory and an Intel i7 processor!  But for under $300, I am amazed HP has packed so much quality and functionality into this thing.Just remember:  do NOT, do NOT, do NOT select \"Express\" setup when you first launch Windows 8 (on this laptop or ANY laptop for that matter!)  Select the CUSTOM manual setup and disable all the unnecessary processes that are defaulted to run on startup.  Yes, it's very easy to do.  You can do this during the setup process as well as after the fact.  That way, you'll have a fast little laptop you'll be very happy with.To prove my point, if you scroll through these reviews and search for another user named \"Donna Mac\", she wrote the following in her review:  \"First of all I made the mistake of doing express setup, made the computer really slow. ... Decided to do a complete factory reset and that seemed to fix all the problems. I did a custom setup and the difference was amazing, everything is now running a lot smoother and faster.\"So there you have it!  Do NOT select \"Express Setup\" when Windows 8 launches.Other than Windows issues, my hat is off to HP for producing a low-priced laptop with so much quality and value.I highly recommend this unit.  I have worked with many different desktops, tablets and laptops throughout my workday for years, so I think my opinion can be relied upon.  Ignore the nay-sayers that don't want to learn how to set up and configure Windows 8.  Get yourself one of these.  It packs tremendous value and build quality for less than $300.  You won't be disappointed.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Goldilocks computer; not too big, not too small, just right", "Author": "World Traveler", "ReviewID": "RIRJLGJME44R8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Rating technology is tricky since it relys on the acumen of the user.  So first a bit about me.I am an average tech user. I know how to fix basic problems but I really don't care about the small details as long as my device is functional.Uses: Mainly this device would be for travel or meetings.Pros:  It is small 10.1 screenThe battery is detachable, which makes it easier to switch out.The battery life is decent: I got a little less than 5 hours from a mix of internet searches, video watching and photo editing.The operating system is actually 8.1.It came with Microsoft Office Home and Student.It was very easy to set up.It is a very functional little computer for a good price.It has built in Windows security softwareThe keyboard was just right for me but then I have rather small hands.It stays pretty cool when you have it on your lap for hours at a time.Cons:The touchscreen is responsive but I found that sometimes it was easy to accidentally go to a previous page or another screen entirely by touching the wrong part of the screen.It takes an inordinate amount of time to download things (but that could be attributed to my wifi)They have a somewhat limited selection of \"apps\" some of them (like a microphone) are already on your computer.The whole windows 8 interface is more of a step sideways than a step forward.There is not much information out there on this computer.  Not even on HP's website.  If you go looking for this elsewhere it has another name:HP Pavilion 10 TouchSmart 10z-e000 Notebook PC (ENERGY STAR)", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT DEVICE", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"BigAppleReport\"", "ReviewID": "RIH8BAJ8GXRB4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "HP PAVILLION Touchsmart10-e010First, let me say that I got this HP laptop after trying two different Asus 1015Es, neither of which, among other issues, would stay connected to the internet. I really liked the Asus but anyway, it just didn't work out and the HP Pavilion Touchsmart was the same size and pretty much identical specs, or at least very similar.I read all the reviews and heeded other reviewers advice to bypass the Express Setup, which so far has prevented the endless downloads noted by some reviewers.Another problem noted by some reviewers was that the included Microsoft Office could A:  Not be successfully Activated and B: if you were successful in Activating it, you could not then subsequently find it.  Here is  the solution to both:I discovered that the key to successfully getting the enclosed Activtion key to work is that you first have to register the device with HP online.  Once I did that, I was able to easily activate and download the Office software.  HOWEVER, no Office icon appeared anywhere, so I had to search all over to find it.To actually find the program go to:c: program files/Microsoft Office 15/root/office 15/There you will see a ton of files that I have no idea what they are or what they do, but once you are there, look for the icons for Excel, Winword etc that say \"application \u201cway over the right.Next, hover your mouse on the program icon you want, right click and then click on \"send to desktop\" or \"pin to taskbar\" and you are good to go.WARNING:  Unless you are an expert, which I most definitely am NOT, don't mess with all those other files because as I say, I have no idea what they do.So far at least, I am loving this little laptop.  Considering the price, I think it\u2019s a great buy.  Yes it is a bit slow when compared to a more powerful device, but what do you want for $300, especially considering you get the usually very expensive Office for free..  I have the full Photoshop program loaded on mine and it works perfectly.  If you need a device for business and need to whiz through your work at lightning speed, then you may want to look elsewhere.  But for me, I am very happy \u2013 at least so far \u2013 with this device.  Again, I heeded the advice noted by other reviewers and chose Manual Setup and I am very happy with the performance of the device.  By the way, the speakers are very nice too and the screen resolution is fine.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Value But Take Note...", "Author": "appalachian", "ReviewID": "ROYK0EXMGP72M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pay attention to the other reviews about doing \"Custom Setup\" the first time you turn on the computer. Choose a time when you are not rushed to do a proper setup and you'll prevent trouble appearing later. Go ahead and setup a Microsoft account at Live.com now to get ready to take advantage of all Windows 8.1 and a Cloud has to offer. It will save a lot of time during computer setup if you already have an account, and you don't need a new e-mail address. You can now get a Microsoft account using any existing e-mail account, including Gmail, Yahoo, local ISP, or your own website's mail. Windows 8.1 takes some getting used to, but if you are a Windows user and have used a touchscreen such as an Android device before, it will be a breeze. If you're one of those still holding on to Windows 95/98/2000 and resist learning new technology, expect a big learning curve requiring lots of time and patience, but well worth it. Vista/7/8 users won't have too much more to learn once you learn where they rearranged everything. XP users... It's just time to bite the bullet.Now, the note...... If you look at the PDF \"Datasheet\" for this model (bottom of the item page) you will see that it is supposed to come with a 65 Watt \"Smart AC Adapter\" (the power supply you plug into the wall). However, HP is shipping these with 45 watt Smart AC Adapters (stamped 45W in tiny print on the adapter). You will likely see a HP warning pop-up after Windows starts that says \"The Smart AC Adapter you have connected will power your computer at a reduced performance level, and resource intensive tasks may cause your system to not perform at its highest level.\" Then it says you can buy a higher rated one from HP. When you find your way to the support webpage for this model about batteries and power, it will tell you that \"newer computers require a 90 or 130 Watt AC adapter\". While I believe the whole thing is aimed at HP selling accessories, the fact remains that the spec sheet calls for a 65 Watt adapter. I corresponded with a lead parts rep who researched it and said they don't even sell 90 or 130 Watt adapters for this model. I agree that's overkill and applies to the larger notebooks instead. However, if someone orders a replacement adapter, they send a 65 Watt adapter. I have one of the older HP 10\" Mini's and it uses a 30 Watt adapter, and this model should operate fine with 45 watts of power available. However, I do not know if these new \"Smart\" adapters have a method of throttling down performance when a 45 Watt adapter is attached, or if it is even possible. When running on battery alone, there isn't an adapter connected at all. The answer is yet to be revealed, but I would NOT let it affect your decision to buy one of these. At 288 bucks, you're still getting a great price, even if you have to buy a 65 Watt adapter later, which is only 25 bucks from HP directly. If your 45 Watt adapter gets hot when your battery is charging AND the applications you are using use a lot of resources, or if your battery doesn't charge when you use resource intensive applications, you definitely need to opt for the 65 Watt Adapter (HP part number 710412-001).Now.... Back to setup. The April 2014 Microsoft updates for Windows 8.1 included a lot of tweaks and feature changes based on user feedback. Therefore, once you're finished setting up, go ahead and download the updates before loading your own software and configuring everything to your own liking. Be sure you look over everything and get the optional updates in addition to the critical updates. Once that's done, if you're an average or above user, go to Control Panel and tweak things such as mouse pointer sensitivity and speed, and other things the way you're used to. Be aware that the \"Settings\" menu added in Windows 8.1 doesn't have everything. You'll still have to go to Control Panel to find everything, especially advanced settings.Next, to optimize performance and gain some speed, I would go ahead and uninstall applications that you know you'll never need. Since Windows 8.1 has Windows Defender built in and is intended to replace Microsoft's security software Security Essentials (optional free anti-virus and anti-malware used in earlier Windows versions such as XP), I uninstalled McAfee (trial) to get rid of the constant nagging to buy a subscription. If you hang out in dangerous places or want extra security, you might feel better having a more interactive and comprehensive security suite such as Bitdefender, but be aware that these applications are often the culprits that cause sluggish computer performance.OFFICE 2013 STUDENT VERSION. YES!! IT IS INCLUDED with this HP model, and it IS a full working version, NOT a trial version. To unlock it, open Office and activate it using the serial number (key) printed on the yellow card that came in the box with the computer. Look for it loose in the box. It's not in the bag with the other documents.I had to return the first notebook I received because of a letter key that was not aligned correctly and would type when lightly brushed over. That was just a random manufacturing glitch though. Amazon had a replacement on the way same day. Other than that, and the possible issue with the Smart AC Adapter, I have been impressed, especially with the features and performance. I like the convenience and portability of using a small device, but I also need the ability to run production software to keep up with work. Added with the touchscreen features, this provides it all at a cheap price. The keyboard is almost full size (91%) and it's easy to connect a larger monitor and accessories, or dock when needed. It's too early to know where battery performance will settle out at, but so far so good. Everything else is as good or better than the specs and descriptions.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great little laptop.", "Author": "Zandra E.

It wants to do about a gigs worth of upgrades between windows and the HP support assistance thingie. So turn off the automatic updates right away if you don't want any huge download surprises.Oh - and when you upgrade with the support assistant, it's like my other HP laptop - it tells you to do the same upgrades again after you do them. Seems to be typical for HP for some reason.So in conclusion, it will be a great netbook for traveling.

Macs are light-years beyond PCs; they are intuitive, cool, classy, and empower the owner like nothing else.  A PC, however, is just a computer.  And I gave this HP laptop 5-stars because (even though being merely a computer) it has some great features and it IS fulfilling my PC needs.  My needs: having an inexpensive computer I can take on the road which enables me to access two essential apps that I can't get on my otherwise-awesome MAC: vectorvest-dot-com, an online investment service, and an antiquated, mostly forgotten MSDOS program from 1988: Lotus Agenda.  Nobody has duplicated Agenda's genius for organizing ideas and data--  nobody, not even close.  It's gotten me through some multi-million dollar productions that had tons of crazy details I had to keep track of or else I would have died a painful death. Therefore, this Mac fanatic totes around a PC with no shame or apologies.The HP Pavilion touch screen is a very nice feature!  The battery life is totally adequate.  The size of the laptop and screen is perfect. Kudos.One of my gripes about PCs is how unintuitive and rigid the architecture is... a PC requires you to learn IT'S ways instead of the other way around -- already knowing what you're needs and wants are so you can spend all your time producing, creating, designing, working... However, I feel this PC gives enough clarity of navigation and usability so that it makes up for its foundational faults (that of not being a MAC).  Oh, and did I mention that I'm a MAC fanatic?Good product, great price, wonderful tool.  If this PC got lost or stolen, I'd race to get a replacement.", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "My niece loves it.", "Author": "NC", "ReviewID": "R19KZC5G8YG9MO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this for my niece's 18th birthday who lives with me.

I use it for doing my personal bookkeeping, word processing, power points, spreadsheets, email, and internet.  It's not quite as fast as the ASUS, but now that I have all my files and software loaded, I'll do some cleanup and hopefully speed things up.The keyboard is just like the ASUS transleeve with Function keys across the top.  It's so  nice to have one cord that stays plugged in all the time I'm home and having 3 USB ports available instead of dealing with a bunch of adapters and cables and cords just to get everything I need to use--mouse, flash drive, backup drive, etc.  It does not have a CD/DVD drive, but if I need something on a disc, I take it to my church or work and copy it to my flash drive, and I haven't had any problems with doing it that way.I uninstalled the MS Office that came on the notebook because I already had a 2010 Pro version that I uninstalled from my tablet and moved to this new HP notebook.The one thing I need and haven't found yet is an adapter to go from USB to 15-pin VGA so I can connect to the projector at church for power point use.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buyer befair", "Author": "jerry t rosi", "ReviewID": "RKX85JDC89OFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought it as a gift, for the price it was more than I expected. those who know laptops were so impressed they couldn't leave it alone.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Barbara Custard", "ReviewID": "R2SWQUWGZ7WQZN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet/laptop is just that, perfect for me as a student.

The Microsoft Office product key was also a nice touch.The drawbacks far outweigh the advantages however. It simply does not have the hardware required for running the OS let alone the bloatware that comes pre-installed with it. It immediately felt sluggish and almost inoperable (no exaggeration). The horrible performance lasted even after I formatted the drive and manually uninstalled the bloatware. Following the suggestion of the top reviewer, I did choose a custom (as opposed to express) setup and it never gave me the choice of picking which programs to install initially. This was a poor design choice coming from HP, it's unthinkable that this even passed quality control (if it did). It's slower than anything I've ever used and I'm accustomed to slow college library PC's. It lags every few seconds and even ceases to respond more frequently than any brand new PC should.In short, it doesn't fulfill its basic role as a computer. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because of the build quality which should be irrelevant anyway since the laptop has virtually no performance at all.

An \"Administrators\" account is a backdoor route viruses/malware uses get in and cause unrecoverable distruction to your data. With Admin rights those malware can easily infect deep within your \"recovery partitions'! meaning, these's not turning back and you're royally screwed. Theres many more problems that can happen but I think you already get my point.GOALS: 1) Don't use your Main MS Account as an\" Adminitrator\" but instead \"standard\"  2) Create a secondary account called \"local account\" and set that up as the Administrator instead.Account Management: steps creating a local account(administrator) and MS Account(standard)Charms search: type\"control panel\" > \"User's Accounts and Family Safety\" > \"Remove User account\" > \" Add a new user in PC settings \" located at bottom of window > Bringing you to Metro > click \"add Account\" > \"Sign in without MS accout\" located at bottom of page > \"Local Accout\" > create new user name and PWYou have 2 options on Signing IN1) Microsoft account or 2) Local Account1) Create or sign in with your MAIN Microsoft Account. If you already an MS account or uses windows phones/ xbox live or Hotmail/live/MSN email address you can use these as well to link those services to 1 master MS Account.2) Create a Local Account. Thise secondary account will not connect to MS's ecosytem but only in your local computer. I identical to USERS login on Windows 7,Vista,XP etc.Once you've setup these two accounts, you must set each account type to: >Change ACCOUNT TYPE for Main MS Account to \"Standard\"Change ACCOUNT TYPE for 2ndary Local Account to \"Administrator\"Please do these steps, it only takes 5minutes.  Its a small price to pay considering, it may  potentially rescue your entire data from a completely erasing your data after sending it for repairs.__________________________________________________________________________Making Back ups/ EtcAnother tip is to make a recovery image.First install Setup all your programs , setup your custom settings, etcAfter personalizing your PC.  > Its time to Create a Recovery Image right after you've set everything up.  This image will allow you to revert back to this pc's state in time, and in perfect working order.Sometimes system recovery doesn't solve your problems so having secondary backup plan like Recovery Image is key.________________________________________________________________________Not optional, must practice these 3 regular computing habits.#1  (Install McAfee Antivirus, which is now free starting 2014, per Intel's 2014 Keynote at CES) or Paid programs such as Kaspersky Internet Security 2014  is the leading software in the market today. $50.  These programs scans your system automatically, so set it and forget it.#2  (Install MalwareBytes/free, scan your pc every month with this program or sooner when you feel like your system is sluggish or seeing webpages poping up that you didnt click)  Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.#3  (Install Superantispyware/free, Scan pc every 2wks)Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.Its ok skip a few scans between months, although not advisable, especially if your a heavy web surfing maniac spending 2-3 hrs daily websurfing not just facebooking.  But please dont go without using all 3 programs more than 5-8 Months in between scans.________________________________________________________________________Another way to avoid  spreading your personal information out there into the wild unknowingly is to un-google yourself.yes ladies and gents! google or yahoo especially yahoo LOL..... but google is key here.Microsoft sells Primarily Software.Apple sells Primarily HardwareGoogle sells neither, that's why their products are so CHEAP, once they suckered in their backdoor ridden ecosystem, Google Inc. sells Primarily Everything about YOU!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Steps in upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1  (2-3hrs)Key here is to ensure your windows 8 is fully updated before upgrading to win8.1Therefore repeatedly \"check of updates\" on windowsHow to upgrade to windows 8.1 for dummies.Step 1: Go to Metro and not desktopStep 2: Start typing : \"Control Panel\"Step 3: Click \"Windows Update\" > \"Check for Update\"Step 4: install updatesStep 5: restart computerStep 6: Repeat step 1 -5 until result \"no more updates\"Step 7: Run HP Update client, install all updates from HP to ensure all drivers and bugfixes are updated.( or whichever OEM you may have, lenovo,dell, sony etc.)Step 8: Uninstall your Antivirus Software (important) then RESTART PCStep 9: Go to Windows Store and upgrade to 8.1Step 10: leave computer on for 2hrs as it upgrades.Step 11: Repeat Steps 1 - 7Step 12: if you're not a complete fool, 8.1 upgrade should be straight forward. \\After steps 1-8 ONLY THEN you should install WIndows 8.1 at the marketplace. Goodluck.(note: steps above removes a lot of failures users experience after 8.1 update)___________________________________________________________Not many want to shell out their dollars on Office 360  if all they intend of using is standard word processors.you can use a free web version of office calledBing.com search:  \"MS Office Web Apps\"just sign in with the same  MS Account user name used on your PC.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "This is a tablet with a keyboard attached", "Author": "Michael DeRose", "ReviewID": "R2X4L2GTAL5QCT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have no idea how this has an average rating of 4 stars or how I have not smashed it to pieces yet.

If you're looking for a product that will fail within a year of the purchase or, in many cases, just after the one year manufacturer's warranty has expired, then look no further. HP offers a plethora of devices that will burn a hole in your wallet and destroy your faith big business. HP's bottom line is not customer satisfaction, but rather profit maximization while reducing product costs, sometimes at the expense of the consumer. You may be thinking \"it won't happen to me\" or \"defects are rare\", but after reading countless reviews, I have come to the conclusion that HP intentionally designs their products to fail just outside their warranty. So when your computing device does break, you find yourself in search of another, which HP hopes you'll come crawling back for round two. Or you may try your luck with HP's notoriously horrid customer service, which just so happens to be outsourced to locations where English competency is more like a peripheral thought.
