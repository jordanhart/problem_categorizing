Sony tech support,although monumentally difficult to reach, were able to remedy the problem. The problem recurred a third time -and Sony's tech support was abysmal. Not only couldn't they help, they were almost impossible to deal with.I was passed through a total of 6 people in 5 different departments and promised an on site visit to remedy theproblem. The 6th individual stated there would be  no on site visit unless I sent them the receipt for the originalpurchase on 6/13, 2013. Sony had ample proof that I'd bought the computer from them - and admitted as much.Their attitude was extraordinary, the worst I've every encountered by a major laptop manufacturer, particularlya premium price manufacturer. Take heed if you're considering buying a Sony laptop.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "fantastic", "Author": "Ahmad Mahrous", "ReviewID": "R3LNHY9MYKSES", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very good sony vaio  laptop touch screenvery powerful pcI love it so muchI prefer sony all my life", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fast performance,but integrated graphics cannot be upgraded", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "RM8IXF835WV2Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is a very good choice for both entertainment and work, but despite having a full HD screen it has integrated graphics that per Sony cannot be upgraded by adding a designated graphics card.  Very quick performance by touchscreen, and the back lit full-size keyboard with 10-key.  The touchpad has click functions built-in and takes time to get used to using it, but it too is responsive.  Sound with ClearAudio + is comparable to Beats Audio in the HP Envy, which surprised me!NOTE: I found this item worked extremely well on the touchscreen and helped me not to smudge my screen - The Friendly Swede Bundle of 6 Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip Universal Capacitive Stylus Pens 4.5\" for Smart Phone Touch Pad + 6 x 15'' Elastic Tether Lanyards + Cleaning Cloth in Retail PackagingI think most users will be very happy with the build-quality, software and features of this laptop.  It runs quietly (very little fan noise) and stays cool to the touch.  I like the port placement on this laptop and having a built-in DVD/CD drive was nice on such a thin design.The Rapid Wake feature is great, as I simply shut the laptop to put it to sleep and open it to go right back to work.  This combined with being able to use the laptop as an access point and the NFC (Near Field Communication) feature, really set this Sony VAIO Fit series laptop apart.I was unable to get Camtasia Studio 8 [Download] to work properly on this laptop due to its integrated graphics, but I was able to use my Creative Sound Blaster EVO ZxR Entertainment Headset With Bluetooth Mobile Wireless in Windows 8.1 using the Bluetooth connectivity on this PC and take my LPs from my Audio Technica AT-LP60 Fully Automatic Belt Driven Turntable using a Hometheatre 3.5mm Male to 2 RCA Female Splitter Cable (6-Inch) connected to the microphone-in jack - using the included Sony Entertainment Sound Forge Studio software.This laptop comes with a trial of Microsoft Office, and 30-days of Kaspersky Antivirus.  I removed the MS Office software and added the free OpenOffice program, in addition to CCleaner, Malwarebytes (free version) and Classic Shell Start Menu.  I also advocate using Google Drive and the office (online based) apps built into Outlook.'Gamers' who require separate graphics cards in their PCs should look elsewhere, but those looking for a solid laptop for home, school or business, should like this one.  It works extremely well for email, Internet browsing, Skype, social media, streaming video (Netflix, Hulu Plus and Amazon Instant Video in HD were all tried...), mixing music, editing photos and home video.NOTE:  If you like to watch DVDs versus using streaming content, you can upgrade the DVD/CD drive to a Blu-ray drive, which I recommend since it has this great HD screen.Overall, I like this PC very much.  While it's nothing special to look at (basic flat black on the outside), under the hood the i7 processor and ample memory make this a joy to use.  The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is the integrated graphics.  They limit the user's ability to use certain types of graphic-intensive software, and don't take full advantage of the powerful processor and HD touchscreen.  Not making it so that this could be upgraded was short-sighted of Sony, particularly at this price point.PROS+ Processing speed and memory combine for quick response.+ Gorgeous Full-HD 1080P display.+ Backlit keyboard+ USB 3.0 (2) ports+ USB 2.0 (2) ports that can be used as charging ports, even when laptop is off.+ NFC (Near Field Communication)+ Can act as an access point for other devices.+ HDMI port+ Full-sized keyboard with 10-Key, feels good to type on.+ Touchscreen is responsive, and works well with Windows 8.1+ HD webcam - works well in low light conditions.+ Good port placement towards the front of the laptop, for easy user access.+ Media card reader+ Excellent microphone+ Stays very cool with use and virtually no fan noise.+ Solid build quality+ Very thin, despite having an optical DVD/CD drive installed.+ Nice software package: Sony Entertainment (for music creation and DVD movie production), 30-days Kaspersky Antivirus, ArtRage Studio, and Adobe Photoshop Elements 12.+ Rapid Wake feature works very well; no need to power down the PC.CONS-Integrated graphics provides fair to poor performance in some programs.- No way to upgrade the graphics with a designated graphics card.- No Blu-ray player, despite having a full HD display. *(Can upgrade optical drive if desired.)- AC power connection to the laptop is somewhat hard to connect, with cable to power brick being lightweight and lesser quality than desired.TIP:  Windows 8.1 64-bit operating system is stable and easy to use once you get the hang of it.  The touchscreen was made for Windows 8 and 8.1, so get to know the system using the touchscreen and you'll probably enjoy the zippy performance and features much more than by using the keyboard and touchpad alone.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Day one review....", "Author": "Tibs Adoor", "ReviewID": "R3TXBJLO88IILL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Received the laptop today, love it. excellent  display,Screen clarity is amazing,very fast, love the rapid wake of Sony, Worth Money.

While there are some good things about this computer, I really would not recommend it to anyone.I will say that I like that it has a 10 key on it (really helpful if you use it for work) and it is really fast.  It turns on quickly and does not struggle to run multiple programs at once.  I don't use it for gaming, but I can have multiple databases, websites and documents open simultaneously and it does not suffer in terms of speed as a result.A lot of the issues is in the design.  The positioning of the touchpad is awful, it's not centered so if you type fast and don't look at the keyboard while typing, it really throws you off if you have to go back and forth between the touchpad and keyboard.  The touchscreen is usually good, but occasionally it just won't work without turning the computer off and on again.  Additionally, the touchpad is really tricky if you want to use it to scroll, zoom in, or anything other than point and click.  I've read the instructions numerous times, and it just doesn't work well.  Also, the placement/sensitivity of the CD Drive is awful, if you carry the computer or pick it up, chances are that you will accidentally open the drive.  Often I remove the computer from it's case and find the drive open, as it does not take much to open it.Like others, it also has something wrong with the wireless connection.  Often, once connected, the wireless will just stop working.  It will show that I am still connected but will lose 1 bar of strength, but when I open a webpage it says that I am not connected to the internet.  The only fix that I have found is to manually disconnect and reconnect, which is just annoying.When spending $1000+ on a laptop you expect issues like these to be worked out.  I even went into the Sony store to ask for advice and the tech in the store basically said that they have had MAJOR issues with the computer and that he wouldn't recommend it.I wouldn't recommend the computer to others.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Customers service is a crap", "Author": "hazem", "ReviewID": "R13W1XG5Q767IN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Customers service is a crapI bought this laptop few months ago,and i think it was the worst decision that i had made in my life,the screen get cracked spontaneously, and Sony refused to repair it.they have the worst customer service.i am not gonna buy any Sony product again.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's good but....?!", "Author": "SalehSaid Majnoun", "ReviewID": "R3ELR66T1DW3FM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was received it,So it's good but it didn't work with my USB net when i concocted by extended line  .", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i7 4500U 1.80 GHz\n8 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n750 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.5-Inch Screen, Intel HD Graphics 4400", "Name": "Sony VAIO SVF1532ACXW 15.5-Inch Touchscreen i7 Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41QQWuUh2ZL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HED016E"}}
