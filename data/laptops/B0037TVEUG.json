{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Only so-so", "Author": "Ameesh Oza \"malharsire\"", "ReviewID": "R2CJGCXWT0E6BH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this because it is a slightly lighter (under 5lb) 16-inch machine at a good deal. Here are my peeves in order of frustration level.1. Wireless reception is VERY weak. I read about this on MSI Wind on other forums too. It cannot catch 802.11 n over a 2 story 2500 sq ft house. Only in the room with wireless router and the next room. All my other devices have no problems AT ALL. I can catch signals upstairs, downstairs, in bathrooms with other devices (laptops and iphones/ipods)...2. Touch pad is slightly different for scrolling etc. from the Synaptics style so that's a little relearning curve.3. Windows Update gave some failures. Could be a Windows 7 issue but I have not seen these on other Win-7 machine. And I haven't even installed too much SW or apps yet.So if you want long-distance wireless or Synaptics style touch pad, this is not for you.", "Date": "April 9, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "MSI A6000-225US Pentium Dual-Core T4500 2.3 GHz 16-inch Notebook General Features:\nGlossy black and gray finish Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 32-bit pre-installed w/CoA\n6-cell Li-ion battery pack Intel Pentium Dual-Core T4500 2.3 GHz CPU 800 MHz FSB, 1MB cache\n3 GB RAM 320 GB Serial ATA hard drive SuperMulti DVD RW DL drive No floppy drive\nNVIDIA GeForce 8200M G graphics", "Name": "MSI A6000-225US Notebook PC - Intel Pentium Dual-Core T4500 2.30GHz, 3GB, 320GB HDD, DVD Super-Multi , 16\" Display, Built-in Webcam, Windows 7 Home Premium", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31fW2tA3MRL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0037TVEUG"}}
