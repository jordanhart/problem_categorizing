{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent Unit Once You Get it Configured", "Author": "akakpaws \"akakpaws\"", "ReviewID": "R18FGSOI2R99XD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "this is a good looking and feeling unit.  I especially like the fact that the key labelling is sharp, clear and large.  The unit runs very cool and quietly.  It has been performing well so far.  The graphics are sharp and clear.The big issue I had was the work required to get it under control. I like to manually set up a new machine including Internet setup so I don't get a bunch or redirects when on line.  This is the first pc I have experienced where you have to go online thru their portal, the unit will not allow manual Internet setup.  There were plenty of startup apps to get under control as well.Once all that is done you have a good performing pc which also looks quite nice in my opinion.  It is noticeably faster than my previous unit.Recommended if you are willing to spend some extra time on setup or you don't care about that kind of thing.  A good value.", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00D601AZA"}}
