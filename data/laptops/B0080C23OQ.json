And, it's Sony brand, what can go wrong. So far I used it for almost a month, here's my feeling toward it.1. Speed = pretty fast. It boots windows and shuts down as advertised. i haven't really compare it with other ultrabook but to compete over 0.5 second to me is silly.2. Weight = 3.5 lb is a bit heavier than I like to. Toshiba portege that I played with at Bestbuy was awesomely light. But there were reports about it being filmsy so I hesitated to get that and end up with sony. Personally I like this to be another 0.5 lb lighter to have that real ultrabook feel.3. screen = man i wish this would be 1600 x 900 that would make this world a much happier place for me. i have this urge to get a S serie and just swap the screen.. :(4. power = ok now. there is a problem. as we all know, ultrabook was suppose to compete with macbook air but macbook air can be on standby mode for days. i had this laptop fully charged in the morning and put on sleep mode but by the time i'm writing this review, 10:40 pm, battery is down to 9% ... something is not right. i will try it again and if the result reversed, i will revise this part of my review. Also the default 5 hour use time is somehow exaggerated. i think 3.5 - 4 hours are more realistic.5. durability = i baby this laptop. i have no intention to rough test it so i'll pass this to someone else to provide.6. accessories = bought a keyboard skin for 2.99 from ebay instead of 19.99 + tax from sony direct. very happy about this.7. upgrades = i added 4gb to make it 8gb. removed the default 500gb hdd with a intel 120GB ssd. i recommend all to do the same. :) i also had to re-install clean windows + office to speed things up.8. keyboard = not a big fan here. the key location is not comfortable compare with thinkpad. and the feel of the click feel i am going to poke a hole in it. but after a while i do get use to it. not happy here but acceptable. no backlit here.thank you all for bare with me. to sum it all up, i like the name sony , the way it looks, and perform for the most part are satisfactory. some minor upgrade such as better screen resolution, led backlit keyboard, would be nice.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "It's Sony, sleek and silver!", "Author": "Billy Gerent", "ReviewID": "R1HV0ARJ07T7QG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice looking machine, suitable for home users and business types, but not for serious gamers due to its lacking a dedicated graphics processor.  It is very solidly built, with no creaking or flexing, and feels very nice to the touch. The touchpad is responsive and has a full area click feature, with the right-hand lower corner reserved for right-clicks. A slight downside is that while clicking, the mouse sometimes drifts away slightly as you are still on the touch surface; I found tapping the touchpad more reliable.The screen is bright and has good viewing angles for this type of device. The screen is glossy and not matte, so it can act like a mirror in bright environments. The resolution is also fine for a screen of this size. It is no retina display for sure as close inspection of letters reveals the step-like stagger of pixellation. However, the key word there is close: at the normal screen to eye distance the stagger is smoothed away naturally - not a deal breaker for me.The webcam is great and produces good colour representation from what I have seen. I have not tried it in low light conditions yet. The microphone also picks up sound very well, so no shouting required.The speakers are surprisingly good and completely hidden. My wife bought an albeit-cheap ($9), USB-powered pair of external speakers before she tried the laptop's and she really should not have bothered: the laptop outperformed them in every way.Speaking of sound, then cooling fan is audible at full throttle, but is is acceptably quiet.Ports-wise, this laptop is well-endowed, especially given its ultrabook form factor: LAN port, VGA, full HDMI, SD & Pro Duo card slot, headphone port, 1x USB 2.0, 1x USB 3.0 (also a sleeping-charge port for external devices).The keyboard is clickless and has that nice resist and collapse feel, so no sponginess.All of this for $800 is an absolute bargain frankly.

However I wanted to clarify some of the specifications.  The weight is variously listed as 3.3 lbs, 3.4lbs and 3.54 lbs.  I believe there is confusion as to whether the number after the decimal point is in tenths of a pound or in ounces.  I have weighed the Vaio T on a digital postal scale and it weighs 3 lbs 5.8 ounces.  In terms of lbs this equates to approx. 3.36 lbs.  The power brick is surprising small.  It weighs 5.2 ounces (the brick and the non- detachable cord that goes from the brick to the computer.)  The brick dimensions are 3.5\" long, 1 3/8\" wide and 1\" high.  The review that lists a \"Con\" has the Vaio being .5 lb overweight may be overstated as I noticed that the specs for the soon to be released Asus Zenbook Prime UX32A (with a hybrid drive) lists its weight as 3.2 lbs.  If that is pounds and tenths of pounds then the difference is actually less than 2 tenths of a pound (or less than 3 ounces).The Vaio T has a 500GB hard drive plus a 32GB SSD in what is listed as a 532GB hybrid drive.  This compares favorably to the announced slew of other ultrabooks with hybrid drives.  The competition (Samsung series 5, Asus UX32A and Acer S5) generally has only a 24GB SSD.  In addition the Vaio has one expandable RAM slot which can take up to 4GB of additional RAM.  I bought a 4GB chip for about $26 and installed it and it worked without any hitches.Hope this helps.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Could have been great", "Author": "OptimusPrime", "ReviewID": "RXSO9GTFVFZ63", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this from Amazon using my friend's prime accountLikes1.

Lightweight, solid and powerful enough to compile code.The key thing this baby does that almost no other ultrabook does, is it has an HDMI port and a VGA port.  You can use either for an external monitor.  AND YOU CAN USE BOTH!  If you put the laptop in projector mode, you can plug two monitors into it and have a 1900x1200 dual display setup.  I do this at home, and use the laptop (with the screen dark) as the keyboard.  I had to cut my VGA cord's screw off one side with pair of diagonal cutter pliers because the two video connectors are so close that a regular VGA connector and HDMI bumped into each other.  With that done, I have pixels out the wazoo.Other thoughts:Display is clean, bright and sharp.  More pixels would be better, but it's OK.Boots fast.  I'd like another USB port, had to get a hub for when I have the mouse, keyboard and flash drive plugged in.Keyboard is nice and solid and I'm a fast typist.  I hate the touchpad, but I'm biased against them.  A bluetooth wireless mouse is just the ticket.  Get one that works with the built in bluetooth so you don't use up a USB port like I did.I set it to hibernate not sleep when the lid is closed to save battery.Cons-It looks so nice, I have to get a 2nd one for my wife.", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fan and Keyboard are Fine", "Author": "john1111", "ReviewID": "RBXZ2D814PIPX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just want to specifically address the issues that had me concerned before buying this laptop.First, I read a lot of people complaining about the fan noise. Yes, many ultrabooks don't even have a cooling fan but it certainly doesn't ruin this laptop. Yes, it seems to always be on BUT its inaudible 90% of the time and it's not even that loud when it's running fast. It's certainly the quietest CPU fan I've ever had. Yes, I'd prefer it didn't have one but it shouldn't stop you from buying this laptopSome other reviews complained about the keyboard. Personally, I like the keyboard a lot. The keys are shallow, but that's not a problem for me. The keys are quieter than many other keyboards and I don't really understand the complaints.Lastly, the form factor is nice- but not as thin as other ultrabooks like the Asus Zenbook or Macbook Air. It's definitely a thin a light laptop in the same league as those, but thicker and noticeably heavier. The aluminum finish is very nice and doesn't pick up fingerprints.What does bother me a bit is that I have been unsuccessful in installing pre-release versions of Windows 8 (consumer preview and RTM versions). I'm assuming that the Windows 8 Pro I'll be able to buy for $15 when it comes out will work without hassle, if it doesn't I'll be furious.4GB of RAM is soldered to the motherboard, and there is an open DDR3 slot. For 20 bucks you can double your ram, which was fairly easy to install.Overall, it's a very nice laptop for the money. Don't let complaints about fan noise or the keyboard dissuade you, but I would wait for Windows 8 if you have the patience.", "Date": "August 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "excellent and light ultrabook", "Author": "ssoonnyy", "ReviewID": "R1AO94PKOP9UBU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This ultrabook looks very nice and very sturdy.

Le", "ReviewID": "RR8WOW0TBDAYW", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The laptop is beautiful with great hardware for the price. However, one issue knocks this laptop down from 5 stars to 2. The CPU fan is always on. It's very annoying. I tried everything to stop the fan from being on the whole time but nothing works. According to the Intel website, the CPU for this laptop can withstand up to 105 degree Celsius so there is no reason why the fan should be on full blast at 40 degree Celsius. Even though this is the only issue I see with this laptop, it is a big issue. Sony should release a BIOS or some other software update to resolve this ASAP. To create such a great laptop and let something like the CPU fan being on 100% of the time to ruin the user experience is just stupid. This would be a perfect Ultra book if the CPU fan issue is resolved. I will keep the rating at 2 stars until Sony releases a software fix for the CPU fan.", "Date": "August 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "An amazing Ultrabook!", "Author": "James Greulich", "ReviewID": "R2UW27KMLA2PD9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is one of the best values I have seen on an Ultrabook! Got mine for about $670 as Amazon was running a $100 rebate special 2 months ago when I purchased it. But, even without that $100 off this is still a good deal.Performance is as advertised... blazing fast boot & \"unsleep\"... you won't beleive it if you haven't seen it before;)At 3.5 lbs, the weight is awesome! Allowed me to take as carry-on on some short flights with small carriers that have weight restrictions on carry-ons due to smaller planes. My old laptop would have put me well over that weight limit.I find the glossy display quite pleasing... in fact, my hi-res photgraphs look better on this than on all 4 other non-IPS monitors I currently use.The keyboard is a bit different that what you may be used to but after a few days of use you won't even notice it any more.Battery life is AMAZING on this thing! Rated at 8 hours but frankly, I was able to get more than that out of it! On a flight across the Atlantic, I had this thing on for 7 hours straight and was still showing abuot 33% battery left. Granted, I had the Wi-Fi turned off and put it in powersave mode, but at that rate, I could have worked for 10 hours without power!Another big plus on this UB is the 500GB HDD. Yes I know, some UB purests would say that the inclusion of a non-SSD exlcudes this from being a true UB but i have to disagree. The great UB performance is all here, as is the light weight, so if it acts and feels like an UB, it must be an UB;)  If I unerstand correctly, Sony has a special 32-GB partition of this 500GB HDD that acts as a small SSD. The system boots and runs essentially tasks off this pseudo-SSD so that's how they deliever this great performance!For me, having that extra storage space was critical. I mainly use this for my photography business and when in the field on a long trip, my process is to back up my CF cards directly to my laptop's HDD, then make an additional copy to an external HDD. On my recent trip to Europe, I shot over 150GB worth of photos, so this would not have been possible on any of the UB's with only ~128GB SSDs.I investing in a USB 3.0 card reader and leveraged this UB's 1 USB 3.0 port to pull some amazingly fast data transfer times! My first experience with USB 3.0 so i have nothing to compare to but this thing was blazing so fast I couldnt beleive it!Only real down-sides I can see with this UB are as follows but both can be easily remedied:- no Optical Drive: definately a weight saving issue here... but i needed to load office, Photoshop and Lightroom. Easy solution was to buy a good $20 USB external DVD drive. Loaded everything up with ease, don't have to carry it with me when I travel, but can use it any time in the future.- limited USB ports: just 1 3.0 and 1 2.0 is proabbly 1 port less than average for UBs. Since I almost always have my mouse dongle in the 2.0 port, that typially leaves only the 3.0 port available. Frankly, I have yet to need more than the 2 ports but of course if you do, you can get a dirt cheap USB port expander.In my mind, neither of these 2 factors detract significantly from the positives with this UB. Would easily recommend this as the UB of choice to everyone i come across!", "Date": "September 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Only 2 flaws", "Author": "Secretagentgmr \"Raul\"", "ReviewID": "R2GRYVU7TGXXNP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for $570.  There was a $100 rebate and a free $100 gift card.  With that in mind, this is an excellent purchase as you are getting a good looking ultrabook for $570.This laptop has only two flaws as far as I'm concerned.  The keys are shallow and you will be prone to missing a few letters as you type.  However, it may be possible to overcome this by tapping keys harder than you normally are used to.  The second flaw is the lack of WiDi which my old laptop had and was quite a useful feature.The fan is inaudible to me.  It is a non-issue.The cold boot time is 20 seconds flat - pretty remarkable feat.I think the best ultrabooks are either Zenbook Prime with IPS display and the new series 9.  But the problem is they cost an extra $600 or more.  You have to ask yourself whether the upgrades you get: slimmer and sexier design, matte screen, and 1080p IPS display (as on the Zenbook) are worth the extra $600.  I personally do not think so.  The truth is I use my ipad for 90% of my computing needs.

The build quality/design is top notch. It feels solid in the hand and no creaking whatsoever. The aluminum finish is a very nice touch, and all around it just feels like it's made to last.The click/mouse pad is just large enough and responsive. I especially enjoy the two finger scrolling, but wish it were a bit smoother to the touch. The keyboard is pretty shallow and the keys are spaced out a bit. So it may take some time getting used to. The screen is mediocre, I use the hdmi port to output to my 1080p tv when I really need the real estate or for watching netflix.It's loaded with bloat so I don't know what's safe to remove to receive future system/bios updates. Or if it will hinder my system in any way if I do. Maybe I can remove everything from Sony and get the updates from their website? For now I'm not messing with them although you can disable most of them.The performance is very good with the 2nd gen i5 processor. Cold booting time is ok, but why didn't sony use the ssd to boot from? Only used for hibernation/wake. What the hell? The 5400rpm drive is also a disappointment. I don't play many games so I haven't got to test the graphics, but I'm sure it's more than capable for my needs.Fan noise. Yes there is a bit of unnecessary fan noise coming from this laptop, as many others have reported. It's not a whine type of noise, but I'm wondering why it's running when the laptop is cool. Hopefully this is addressed in a future bios update, but it's not that bad of a problem some are making it out to be. I've had worse.Only two usb ports? Ummm what the hell Sony? Well I recently watched a video of someone disassembling this machine and the reason why is that there are two large speakers on each side taking up all that space on the front ends. This results in above average sound, but you're sacrificing ports. Nothing that a usb hub can't fix though.So all in all this isn't a perfect machine (but what is?) and for $800 you could do worse. I cannot justify paying $500 more for a \"premium\" ultrabook. Overkill IMHO. So at this price point it's a good value in the ultrabook market, and people will think you paid over $1000 for it.

This is because the Windows 8 upgrade installation does not contain the AHCI drivers required to manage the Rapid Wake SSD accelerated disk configuration. The BIOS interface here is very limited and doesn't let you do much besides pick a boot device. To get around this, make sure you DISABLE acceleration (Control Panel -> Intel Rapid Accelerate something) before you start the upgrade (you can also pop back into Win 7, disable, reboot and go back to the Windows Setup option).

I changed my desktop picture recently from a bright colored bottom to a picture with dark and light color combination, and I realized that the screen is actually vibrating in the middle when I type! It also moved when i just move the laptop slightly.The frame along the bottom of the screen on the right has also started to separate slightly from the LCD screen itself! It's not somewhere I could have broken myself, so I can only imagine that it is the poor quality of the laptop.Other faults?.  The fan has been extremely noisy when the laptop warms up/boots up..  It cannot handle heavily graphical games. It gets really really hot near the CPU and fan..

A thin laptop - yes for sure", "Author": "DJ_K", "ReviewID": "R23EJFULRS51G", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, to give an idea of which laptops I'm used to, and first impressions of the Vaio ultrabook in comparison to thesethe Thinkpad series for company/work purpose(from the earlier models to quite recent ones, but not 'ultrabook' thinkpad like X1 carbon)Asus G74sx gaming laptop (personal/gaming use)A thinkpad T61 I have lying around.Looks:With the lid shut down, this is the definite winner with its silver/Aluminum glossy and quasi-business look. I was a bit worried it might look a bit too 'personal' or home-usey type but that was not the case at all. Looks sleek, sharp well defined polite edges, and shiny at places without looking gaudy, I could take it to a client meet if I had to and not feel embarrassed.With the lid open, well its more of very 'simple' look really. But growing on me. In comparison, the Thinkpad have a very professional layout and with all bell and whistles buttons. And yep, wont compare it to the gaming laptop cuz thats a desktop replacement.Has at least an inch and half of metal above the screen, and an inch on the sides. Sony could have worked on the form factor here, but this design might be for whatever build/engineering purpose I do not know about.Keyboard: Thin low profile (not deep as with the Thinnkpads) flat type keys like the Asus gaming laptop. The Asus laptop's keys feel soft to touch and barely make noise while typing. This ultrabook's keys seem somewhat a bit 'hard' in composition and make more or less same noise as the thinkpads while typing. Some people have complained about the layout feeling alien or taking time getting used to.. but I'm typing this review on the ultrabook and am feeling at home already. Looks wise everything of this ultrabook is in silver/aluminum but for the  keys which are black in color.Trackpad: ALL.MY.RAGE. Yes I mad. And as an update, this review accidentally went live while I was hitting the piece of crap trackpad. It feels like someone spilled some pasta sauce/olive oil over here.. and then cleaned it up by spraying Mr clean. As in Looks smooth, feels sticky/sketchy and is non responsive sometimes. Why should I have to tap so hard or try a couple times to catch the scroll bar of a page. I have a Motorola Atrix webtop (the first version that came out), which was notorious for its stupidity of trackpad. This ultrabook has its pimped out cousin. Seems like since Sony has integrated bluetooth 4.0 into the laptop, it assumed (I assume) that everyone will be using a wireless/blutooth mouse.(And also, could have at least kept a really thin separation between the mouse button and the rest of the pad.. instead of it just being an extension of the keypad. Now I have to look to place my thumb at the right place, instead of getting a feel for it. Will take a bit till I get used to it, but this part is my personal gripe). Wont compare the trackpad to the Thinkpad's (uber excellente) or Asus's (somewhat slippery) cuz Ha..haha..hahahaha <turns into neurotic r4g3>As a disclaimer, please dont judge the overall machine based on quite unfavorable opinion on the trackpad. And if you're a mouse user, well you know.Processor, power etc: This has an i5 3rd gen, so its good for work, occasional whatever else I guess. Benchmarks could be referenced from anywhere, personally I havent had any issues or noticed something below expected speeds. All ok here.Operating sounds: Not good again here. It creaks and whines when Windows is updating, you open a doc (or web page even sometimes) and just sometimes randomly (yep some regular cpu churning internal process might be eating cycles at that instant..). It doesn't bother me too much, and its not that loud. But the noise is present for sure. The thinkpads are much quieter. Feels out of place as its a very sleek and powerful looking piece of hardware, shouldnt have whine thusly.Battery: good. Not real ultrabook levels maybe, it says 3+ hours remaining for quite a long time (like first 2 hours at least). Not really my area as I charge regularly, and would be carrying the charger wherever I go.Form factor and weight: Its sleek for sure..though still almost looks and feels like a laptop, not an ultrabook. At 3.5lb its no feather. But it feels and looks sturdy - like sleek titanium alloy made for 007's field work type( not the Ima drop this on your foot like a rock type)Ports: Cant complain here - an usb 2.0 and 3.0 each and there's the HDMI and monitor out (in case u need to plug in that projector). There is built in bluetooth in this machine so that takes care of a couple of things by getting bluetooth devices.Sound and such: Havent tested. Will not be using this for audio enjoyment thingy. Noting this in the review as sound is supposed to be Sony's strong suite, and I watched a video on youtube by some dude who had opened up this machine - it showed dedicated nice bar speakers on each side, so its a plus probably if sound is considered.Overall opinion: Its not that less heavier than most laptops. Sure is sleek. Looks sleek and classy. Flat type keyboard (not deep keys). Trackpadseems definite weak point as of now (maybe will free up after use, will update after some use). Almost feels like a thinner/sleeker laptop than an ultrabook. Considering everything 3.5/5", "Date": "May 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "FAILURE TO LAUNCH ... DISAPPOINTING ...", "Author": "M.

It was well made, functional, durable and well worth the money.  This Sony VAIO is completely different.  To be fair, it starts-up quick and seems to perform well from a processor standpoint.  But the overall package disappoints ... The keyboard is difficult and very inefficient for typing input.  In fact, it's just downright unpleasant to use.  The touch pad is a complete failure and poorly engineered for both hardware and software.  In fact I'm typing this review using a Logitech K520 keyboard/mouse combo.  I have this observation.  It is very hard to find a good laptop right now.  As Microsoft tries to transition us to Windows 8 and newer versions of Office that look pretty but are very inefficient and de-optimized for input it seems like laptops are also in this phase but in hardware-way.  Ultrabooks sound great but they're not really holistically very good machines, especially for input, durability or reliability.  I guess the margins are so thin that companies can only  provide sub-par customer service.  Even if this is the norm and Sony is doing what the others are doing ...

First of all, the computer seems very slow even with fresh operating system.  More importantly, after less than one month of use, one key in the keyboard showed problem. Sometimes it worked, sometimes it did not. Then, more and more keys stopped working. I went to Sony's store in China and was told that the machine was bought in US so I have to repair it in US (Is this the global service from Sony).  Now, I have to use an external USB keyboard to work.This is definitely the worst computer that I have purchased. I will give 0 star if I can. Do not buy this one, it is a waste of money and a product of trouble.Update: I contacted Sony to report this problem. Sony asked me to restore the system to factory setting. At that time, the system is almost completely down and it cannot recognize external hard disk connected via USB. I contacted Sony and confirm them if the restore will affect files on D drive and E dirve that I have estabilished. After I got a \"No, the system restore will only affect C drive\". I started to restore the system. After the restore, I was horribly found that D dirve and E drive are gone!!!! All my data are lost.  I have IBM thinkpad and dell laptop with me and have done restore several time, none of them affect D drive. For Sony I contacted and confrimed with them, but still I lost my data.
