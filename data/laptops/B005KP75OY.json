{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good buy........", "Author": "kevin", "ReviewID": "R1SVULDXMW2OU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Wanted a laptop to replace my 3-year old Toshiba Satellite, which slowed down and froze up until it died. Replacement was to be for family use primarily, with basic applications such as word processing, banking, shopping, browsing etc. So far, I have had no complaints.The I3 processor is quick enough for my needs, the system boots up very quickly (about 20 seconds or so - a far cry from the Toshiba), and I've had no crashes or freezes so far. Build quality could have been a bit better....this Dell feels....well, delicate. You don't feel like it can take any sort of abuse...which is not a real issue with me because it remains on my dining room table anyway. Dedicated numeric keypad is a definite plus, along with USB 3.0 connectivity, Bluetooth and WIDI. Overall, a competent and capable family laptop,", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Laptop harddrive crash", "Author": "AFI", "ReviewID": "R2Y9240PMJA5LU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This laptop was purchased for my child and worked well.  After 7 months the hard drive crashed and couldn't be booted.  A call to support - took awhile after being shuffled around - determined that the drive needed to be replaced.  A box was to be mailed to send computer back to company.  After a week and no box I called again.  They told me that no box was sent and they could send a box (after I went through the entire set of problems again) but it would take 4-6 weeks to get the computer back.  For $40 I could have someone come out to the house and fix it in 2 days.  I bit the bullet and the tech came out and fixed it.  He was quick and the computer came back to life after decompressing (2 hours).  Of course everything was lost on the computer and we had to start all over - loading itunes and every other piece of software.  Lost all documents, mail, etc.  Do those backups - your computer may fail 6 months in and not 3 years in.BTW - my other child has a Dell also (3 years older) and it started getting really hot and shutting down.  While the tech was here I mentioned that to him and he suggested we pull the cover off and see if lint was collecting near the fan and heatsink.  He was right on - pulled a little hairy mouse ball out and the computer works like a charm.  Remember to get that compound/paste for the heat-sink if you remove it.", "Date": "June 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good laptop for the price", "Author": "Cornelius B. Henning \"Neels Henning\"", "ReviewID": "RKPUN8VGTUDPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from Dell direct a little while ago. I am quite pleased with it. This is my third laptop, the first Dell laptop, although I have bought many Dell desktops over the past 10 years, both for personal use and for the company I worked for. I have never been disappointed with Dell quality and this is no exception thus far. I had an issue because I was promised a complimentary 15 month subscription for McAfee as part of the package, but when I activated McAfee, they only activated it as a trial version for 3 months. Sent an email to Dell support and their response was immediate and effective. McAfee was activated for 15 months in a matter of hours.I don't understand why people gripe about the keyboard. I have no issues with it. I even had to remove it to bump the memory up to 8GB and everything kept working just fine when I replaced it. The only criticism I have is the fact that the indicator LEDs are on the side of the unit, out of sight of the user. This was a stupid design decision by Dell.The machine has all the horsepower I need for my work (mostly software development). I don't use it for games - my machines work for a living, they are not toys. You cannot reasonably expect better performance at this price. If you want better performance, expect to pay more.I will buy it again if it ever became necessary.", "Date": "February 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "First laptop", "Author": "Styles", "ReviewID": "R2A8NG7OGGSF0N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the first laptop that I have owned and really tried putting in the time in finding just the right one for me.

Then last week the entire operating system went out, so I had to wait to receive a CD to re-load the operating system.  Once I received the CD it took over two-hours to reload the system and I lost all of the items that I had saved on the harddrive including pictures of my family and grandchildren.

Moore", "ReviewID": "R3G5S5RLQEDU6X", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Making this simple:Pros:Looks like a newer model laptopChiclet keyboard that many likeClean lookingCons:Dell Customer is a joke, more later...Build quality is okKeyboard feels loose and flimsy, this is not screwed down.Speakers are on the bottom, facing down.To replace the hard drive you will have take the laptop apart, remove the lcd display and then the motherboard.No SSD compatibility according to the Dell support (laptop crashed when installing Windows on an SSD drive). This does not seem likely since a SSD drive is supposed to work in the same configuration as a hard drive. Maybe a firmware update is needed.I took this apart so I know this laptop a little better than most.  I had to do this to upgrade, or try, the hard drive to a SSD drive.Runs fine for the most part, but have concerns of build quality and durability and the design flaw to replace the hard drive.***Updated my review***I had quite a few issues with the Dell support and customer service. However, after getting through to the US Customer service I was able to get my restocking fee waived. So I moved this up a notch.EDIT AGAIN!Dell Customer service is a joke.  If you have any problems don't expect Dell to step up.  I was called saying they were going to refund my restocking fee, however they didn't.  I called them to ask when this would be credited back and they said they didn't have any notes on this and I would not get the restocking fee waived.The first time I called to get the SSD drive assistance I was tranferred to 5 different departments, most of them incorrect.  Then when I want to return the laptop, they transferred me to about 4 more departments, 2 incorrectly.  I spend about 1.5 hours on that ridiculous call.Now they are saying their customer service didn't call me to waive the restocking fee, even though I have the voicemail still.  They aren't replying to my emails now about this.
