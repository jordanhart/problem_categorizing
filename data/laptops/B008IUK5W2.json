It's got a nice hard drive, it's fast, I can connect to my tv With the HDMI output. It's pretty much got everything. For the price it's a steal. I got mine locally, didn't realize Amazon sold it. But would highly recommend one. The other reviewer with the horrible review got me a little worried, but it seems like he might be writting about another model as this one is too new for him to have it for the length of time he says he had it.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great price and features for a lower budget", "Author": "Richard", "ReviewID": "R3JHYCP7L5CS62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is awesome!

So I really needed one that is easy to use, reliable, good quality. (This thing is solid as a rock!) I shopped and shopped for several months, looked closely at other brands, reviews, ratings, etc, and decided this was the one for me!", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dell is terrible", "Author": "B. Herrera \"Two Cents\"", "ReviewID": "RQBW8NYPIDCLC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "At first I was very excited about this laptop. It is light, fast, had a nice keyboard and a good display. But within a month of use, it died on me. A subsequent call to Dell revealed, and you shouldn't be surprised, no problems. I ran the hardware check up and no problems were revealed. The man on the other end of the line told me to be at ease, but I didn't trust him.A year later, this laptop is useless. First, extra digits, letters and symbols popped whenever I typed. Then, the Windows help screen started to pop up, and within seconds the computer would crash. I called Dell again, to hear the obvious: No problems. Foreseeing disaster, I deleted all my data to make the laptop ready for sale (for parts). After defragmenting, guess what? Computer doesn't even boot.I did follow some leads, like a faulty heat sink, a shorted power source, viruses and errors, but nothing. Not even the techs from the big box retailers could help me. The only lesson I've learned is the following: Dell is selling faulty motherboards, made to last as long as the warranty covers them. As soon as that warranty is up, computer dies, you lost your money and on top of that, you need to buy a new one.\"Dell is not what it used to be\" -quoting the Geek squad. I would go one step further. Dell sucks.", "Date": "November 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Laptop overheated and fried the hard drive in 23 Months", "Author": "bookworm", "ReviewID": "R3MNJFL4I92ZAB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Simply the worst computer I've bought from Dell, and this was my fifth one! We paid over $800 for ours (upgraded a few items, thinking we would have it long term - what a joke!) and bought it direct from Dell.I've had to take it to a local repair place since our 1 year warranty has expired (makes you think they build them just to last past that one year mark, doesn't it??) and have spent over 10 hours on the phone dealing with various departments. As upset as I am about the product, I'm even more upset about Dell customer service department (what an oxymoron, they do everything possible NOT to provide service). I honestly think they run their business like the health insurance companies, just keep transferring the client and denying coverage until they give up.When I was talking to their tech support rep, he admitted that they've had overheating issues with this laptop.  So when your car manufacturer realizes that there's an overheating issue, what do they do? They issue a recall notice, they ask that you bring the vehicle to a dealership so they can see if your car has that problem, and THEY FIX IT, no charge! Sadly, this experience has taught me that I should not have assumed that the company I believed in would actually be customer focused. Dell tries to avoid being held accountable for their lackluster product. Do your homework before buying this piece of doodoo, just check the Austin Better Business Bureau and you'll see that they have had OVER 9,100 complaints filed against them in the last 3 years!", "Date": "July 26, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008IUK5W2"}}
