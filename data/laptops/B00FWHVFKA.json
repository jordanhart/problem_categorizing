{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazingly Thin and Powerful", "Author": "Debra Merrill Mccullar \"peace\"", "ReviewID": "R2OZDJX0JCT2S9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At first I purchased this laptop for college. Since I am taking programming I wanted the extra resolution and the 1080p IPS display on this baby is fantastic. The i7-4700hq with the gtx 765m allow me to take Far cry 3 to the max aside from AA which I leave off since it barely shows jagged edges and the game usually plays at 35-45 fps. I also play skyrim at high with a ton of texture mods and a high power enb and I bounce between 40-60 fps depending on the scene. The keyboard is pleasing to type on and is back lit with 3 settings off, 50%, and 100% although you may be able to control it further but using the FN + Spacebar gives you those options.This laptop has a singe stick of memory so you can easily upgrade the memory should 8 gigabytes if ram be insufficient or you want to dual channel the memory for increased bandwidth. One thing that I love is the possibility of 2 Hard drives and 2 msata drives; the 750gb 7200rpm (they still make laptops with 7200rpm drives O_o) is snappy however I added a 240gb corsair msata drive. I turns out to add these msatas you have to take the entire back off of the laptop but it was very easy and almost impossible to put a screw in the wrong hole.One thing to note is that the dual fans are noisy but it doesn't bother me and the palm rest on the laptop stays cool as all can be. but at the the top next to the power button it gets very very hot since both the cpu and gpu are up there which allows to palm rest to stay so cool which is fine since you most likely will never need to touch up there.The battery life while gaming is about an hour for me at max performance which is fine since if you are gaming unplugged the cpu and gpu are throttled and you don't want that for gaming since you lose performance. However when it is in balanced you get 3 hours of use and when you are in power saver it can last up for 5 hours .Over all I would buy one again (The newest version of it that is)", "Date": "February 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Low frame problem?", "Author": "Pat94", "ReviewID": "R3LM0QTQE85599", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I am pretty satisfied with this gaming laptop. Not that heavy and long battery life.I mostly play League of Legends on this laptop and see low frame problem...My setting is medium and the frame is only 35-40 while my friend's laptop with lower or 'not better' specification maintains 60 fps....Is there problem with my laptop? There is no problem with playing but...I feel somewhat wasted my money since this laptop maintains lower frame.. and the screen sometimes blacks out...I never dropped the laptop and have used it perfect safety...", "Date": "March 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "So So - Better Options Out There", "Author": "J. Borregoresner", "ReviewID": "RDG38JRS99COQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First, let me state that my review is biased as I was expecting an IPS display - the Gigabyte lists an \"LCD\" and an IPS screen on their website but no specifics on what exact model number has which.The unit I received most definitely did not have an IPS - I would guess it's a run of the mill, low quality WLED like everyone else is slapping into laptops today.The other drawback is display housing/bezel - it looks like an early 90's IBM notebook: butt fugly.  I guess if you like that retro look but personally we suffered through those days and a little more style is warranted.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00FWHVFKA"}}
