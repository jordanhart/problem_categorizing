I returned it - took 3 days to get there - and was charged $150 for returning it. The refund was made 3 days after the product was delivered to its origin. I feel utterly ripped off. The unit is worth, at best, $700. I expected a much newer unit in much Better shape for $1450. And I did not expect to get screwed out of $150 for returning a unit that was a pile of crap and certainly was not what I believed it to be based on the amazon listing.Totally disgusted.", "Date": "September 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "What you expect from a 17\" Macbook Pro with High End Screen", "Author": "N. Cain", "ReviewID": "R2GAXGGHCF2SWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a really great machine here are my specs.17\" Intel core i7 is a beast! Purchased brand new and custom from the Apple online store in summer 2010. I've upgraded the memory to 8GB and has the 7200 rpm 500GB hard drive and superdrive. The battery has a cycle count around 300 which is listed as normal under system information and still holds a wonderful charge.Never had any repairs on this machine and it has never given me any problems. There are a few light scratches on the casing from everyday use, and the black nubs on the bottom have some light wear but cosmetically I think the machine can still pass as brand new.All the current programs run extremely well on this machine and if you have the chance to own one do yourself a favor and purchase one.", "Date": "June 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "ALEJANDRO SANCHEZ", "ReviewID": "R3F7C2Z239OTQC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with this laptop.

(SORRY APPLE I'M NOT AS CRUEL AS YOU ARE I WILL GIVE IT TO A FAMILY MEMBER WHO IS USING A G4 17\" LAPTOP.... MAYBE IT WILL BE AN UPGRADE FOR THEM???? Mine wont even render video with After Effects CS4, as fast as my old 2007 imac did, this is a joke and I am starting to feel real contempt from Apple, whom I will never ever give another penny to. I sure hope that poor person above me who gave 5 stars doesn't do any 3D OR AVC video editing(SOMETHING YOU NEED A QUAD FOR). I'll wrap this up by stating never to buy Apple again after the way they treated me on the phone(the rep Matt even conceded to me he would have bought it thinking it was QUAD CORE) and then proceeded to hand me off to someone who acted like my paltry $2500 wasn't worth giving me the time of day over.. Good luck to all who buy THIS wreck of a machine from any site.", "Date": "April 11, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003LUN5JO"}}
