Windows 8 took some getting used to, but after trial and error, it is fairly easy to work.  The touch pad is toward the left, which I thought strange, but again, just takes time to get used to.  As a fast typist, the keys may not register at times, but these are the only complaints I could think of.  The processer is very fast, and visually, the screen is very bright.  Webcam and mic work perfectly, and the lighted keyboard is great for typing in dim lighting.  I recommend this for students.  Another plus is the cd rom which seems to all but vanished on other laptops.  Hope this helps!  BTW, I also had to use the online Lenovo tech support once, and was walked through my dilemma with ease and much courtesy.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great PC", "Author": "Frank", "ReviewID": "R1UXMISGQDJ01K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "All around very good PC. Very fast, screen very bright, good battery life. Very reliable, has never frozen or crashed. Sometimes the keyboard isn't as responsive as I would like, such as not registering keystrokes when I have fully pressed the key. I do type fast, but that shouldn't factor into it. It happens enough where I know it isn't me not touching the key, but isn't a major hinderance. I do recommend this product.", "Date": "October 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Loving it!", "Author": "Madison", "ReviewID": "RVONNCXPNRSKP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this computer for about 6 or 7 months now. Still runs great. The touch screen took me a minute to get used to seeing as this was my first touch screen laptop, but it didn't take long.

It worked great. Really fast processor and great graphics. But after three months it died completly. Wouldn't even boot up. After a week of arguing with Lenovo the finally agreed to replace it. Three weeks later a much lesser laptop arrived. I returned that for a full refund and bought a Toshiba Satellite P75-A7200. A better laptop for a lesser price. My advice: Buy a different brand!", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00DSPPJVY"}}
