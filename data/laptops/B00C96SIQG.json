I gave 4 stars because this machine cannot be upgraded or modified without voiding the warranty. I purchased with the intent of upgrading the drive to a SSD and after several videos and surgeon like prescision trying to pry the backing off (Use a credit card to pop the tabs without breaking them once you have it started) I was able to swap the drive successfully. After that it took several attempts to find the right settings to get the machine to recognize the drive and allow for an OS install. Windows 7 drivers are non-existent without serious searching and there is no recovery disc since the original drive has a restore partition.If you intend to use it \"as-is\" you can't go wrong. It's not much for updating though.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00C96SIQG"}}
