Also seems to have very quick processor and hard drive performance compared to earlier Intel dual core processors. The screen is sharp and bright as well. The speakers leave a lot to be desired, but they may not be significantly different than most non-multi-media or non-game-based designed systems.", "Date": "April 17, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Processor: i3-3120M\nMemory: 4GB DDR3\nHard Drive: 500GB\nScreen: 17.3\" LED\nWindows 8", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite C875-S7103 Notebok Laptop / 3rd Gen Intel Core i3-3120M processor/ 17.3\" LED HD Display / 4GB DDR3 / 500GB Hard Drive / Multiformat DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW drive / Built-in HD webcam/ Windows -8 / Satin Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31YroqHrsiL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BGTRYN0"}}
