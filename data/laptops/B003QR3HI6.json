{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overheating & nonworking keys", "Author": "owl", "ReviewID": "R21259C6FPIEGJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Like the other reviewer, I have found that keys often fail to work, especially the spacebar, so while I'm typing, I constantly have to go back to add a space. This greatly slows down my work and is very annoying. In addition, out of the box the computer had a tendency to overheat, whereupon it would shut itself down. This appeared to be due to inadequate ventilation, which was somewhat alleviated by my adding props to hold the thing further off the table surface; nevertheless, the fan runs loudly quite often. Neither of these is a terrible problem; nevertheless, either of them alone would suffice to make me prefer any other brand to another Toshiba.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Matt Fox", "ReviewID": "R1OM90KLXY2NNN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not sure what the other reviewer is talking about.

Does everything you need.", "Author": "Nicholas Lyon", "ReviewID": "R3NQ2AJ2TEJ6D9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I used this laptop for the past 2 years almost daily and had no problems. All the keys worked fine, no screen issues, and the battery lasted a long time. If you're looking for a lightweight windows PC with a long battery life this machine won't disappoint. Other reviews mentioned overheating and non-working keys but from experience, and heavy usage, the machine never overheated and all the keys still work like new. I would definitely recommend this laptop.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "cschilling68 \"Chillin\"", "ReviewID": "R223KXKKLH3MNV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This computer is sweetexcept that the space bar often does not work as you can see by this post.
