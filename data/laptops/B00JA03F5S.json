The item was shipped very quickly and arrived much sooner then the estimated delivery date.  It is hooked-up and I was able to install my mouse driver and connect my external drives.  Hoping to get much use out of this laptop.  No issues so far.  I will update this rating once I have it fully operational.", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,699.99", "Features": "Genuine Windows 8.1 64-Bit; Intel Core i7 Quad Core 4th Gen Haswell CPU (2.4GHz-3.4GHz, 6MB L3 Cache)\n17.3\" Full HD TruBrite\u00ae LED Backlit Display (1920x1080); SuperMulti DVD/CD burner; HDMI\u00ae & VGA Ports\n16GB DDR3L 1600MHz SDRAM (4 Dimm); Intel HD 4600 Graphics; HD Webcam & Microphone; Gigabit LAN\n250GB Performance Solid State (SSD) Hard Drive; 750GB Secondary Data Storage; harmon/kardon Quad Speakers\nFull Size Backlit Keyboard, Intel AC [2x2] Wi-Fi & Bluetooth v4.0 with WiDi Support, 1 Year Toshiba Warranty", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite P75 17.3\" Quad Edition Laptop - Intel\u00ae CoreTM i7-4700MQ - Full HD 1080p Display - Prestige Silver - 250GB SSD Performance Hard Drive - 750GB Storage - Intel Wireless AC Dual Band - Backlit Keyboard - P70-ABT3N22 with 16GB RAM", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Pm8b1o1EL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00JA03F5S"}}
