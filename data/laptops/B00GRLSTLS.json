Note the screen is 1600*900, not 1366*768 that lenovo has it on its website. This CPU is 2.5ghz boosting to 3.1ghz. Not 3.1ghz base clock. The sound on this is amazing! It could easily fill up a whole room. Quality is amazing.They should have added a subwoofer but overall the sound is great! This feels light enough and overall it is a great laptop! Shipping took a while but all in all, great laptop!", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Delayed again-Finally have it!", "Author": "Lucas A.", "ReviewID": "R15AU3IVSLY1A2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had read several complaints on Lenovo's shipping, canceling orders, and overall poor customer service.  Some reviews sprinkled in didn't have any of those issues.  More people post to complain than praise so I went ahead and looked at their computers.I talked to a Lenovo customer service rep through the website and he said there was a about a 10 day wait from order to estimated shipping.  No problem as the Christmas holiday week was coming up in two weeks and I don't need a computer until the new year.  That shouldn't be a problem at all the rep assured me.I placed the order and checked back on the Order Detail periodically to see about its shipping.  It was delayed from a couple of days after Christmas to the 10th of Jan.  Well that's inconvenient but I can get by until that time I figured.  Three days later I get an email from Lenovo about a shipping delay.  Completely annoyed I check the website to see it was the same delay they posted three days before.  Thanks for that timely email~Today I check to see maybe it would ship early.  That's a no.  In fact it's now delayed even longer and I won't see it until the end of January at best.  At least this time when I get the shipping delay I will know it's for something they changed a couple of days before.If I ever get this computer I'll be sure to update this rating.*I received the computer several days after they said it should arrive once it was finally shipped but it arrived packed well and in good condition.The computer has several nice features.-The full number pad was something I wanted since I use it for work.-The backlit keyboard is a nice touch when working in low light situations.-The speakers are above average.  Better then my old HP laptop's setup.-The battery runs for several hours if you maximize your power save settings.  So it's good to get work done on long trips w/o a power outlet.-This laptop runs alot cooler than my old HP.  The HP would almost burn you at times.  The Lenovo barely puts out heat unless I start streaming video.The drawbacks that I have encountered are-The touchpad/trackpad is a pita.  It takes some getting used to.  If I am at my desk I use a USB mouse.-It will need to be updated to Windows 8.1 which is free but it does take some time to complete.-The wifi is sketchy sometimes.  I have had the computer about a month and have had to reset it a couple(4+) times already.Overall once you learn Windows 8 this is a fine computer and it's build quality is better then HP and Dells that I have owned.  I would recommend it unless you need it quickly as it took a long time to finally build/ship.", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.00", "Features": "Processor - 4th Generation Intel Core i5-4200M (3.10 GHz 400 MHz 3 MB)\nOperating System - Windows 8 64\nMemory - 6.0GB PC3-12800 DDR3L SDRAM 1600 MHz\nGraphics Card - Intel HD Graphics 4600\nHard Drive - 500GB 5400 RPM", "Name": "Lenovo Z710 Laptop Computer - 59400487 - Black - 4th Generation Intel Core i5-4200M (3.10 GHz 400 MHz 3 MB)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/21pYCX9UGOL.jpg", "ProductID": "B00GRLSTLS"}}
