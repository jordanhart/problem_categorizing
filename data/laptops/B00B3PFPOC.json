It's just a perfect screen size 15.6\" you can view everything in my computer lab class. It runs fast and smooth. Battery life is average about 3 hours. Clear resolution and great energy saving settings. Trying to adjust to not having Microsoft office provided, they only give you 1 month of Office 365 which I like, but takes a bit of getting used to. Windows 8 also takes some adjusting to, but easier than what other reviewers seem to indicate. Keys are big and sensitive, love having the number keypad again. Perfect computer for college students or anyone wanting a larger memory and fast computing this is a gem.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Toshiba Satellite S855D-S5148", "Author": "Animal", "ReviewID": "R3S6CN7FDERVQB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop is not as bad as some comments ive read say.

If you have questions, please ask; I will do my best to help you with an answer.My only frustrations are that the heat \"exhaust\", 2 usb slots, and the mic and headphone sockets are all on the right side of the laptop; like it was built for someone who is left-handed. There is one usb slot on the left side, which also houses the dvd drive. The location of these isn't a problem if you use the built-in mouse or you use a separate mouse with your left hand. The heat \"exhaust\" where the cooling fan blows heat away from the machine gets TOO HOT to have my mouse/hand in a normal/comfortable position; I use the mouse near the front right corner of the laptop (as it's facing me) to keep my hand away from the extreme heat. Again, it's not a problem if you're left-handed or you use the built-in mouse. I hope this helps others looking to purchase. Again, if I can be of any help with a question, please ask; but only on this specific model laptop (Toshiba Satellite S855D-S5148 15.6-inch laptop, Ice Blue Brushed Aluminum).I purchased this directly from Amazon. They are the ONLY ONE I would purchase computers from here; and I'd do it again it was received in brand new condition and it arrived on time. Thanks Amazon!UPDATE: I now have had this laptop for almost a year. I still think it's a great machine with two caveats:  1) It really feels like it's made for a left-handed user because of all the ports and the very hot heat \"exhaust\" on the right side where my mouse hand sits (it's not very comfortable to use an external mouse as a right-handed user) and the disk drive being located on the left side. 2) If you are a gamer looking for a gaming machine, NOTICE the resolution of this machine is maxed at 1366 x 768 (a few online games are now recommending a resolution of 1600 or better).

Wish I had windows 7. Eight make all internal computer actions hard to do. The computer is the fastest I have owned and all of the hardware works as advertised. With its broad array of features it is a value for the cost. The software included is useless. I have removed most of the pre-loaded programs.Windows eight even controls Shype in a very hard to use program format. Internally Skype disappeared (in windows 8 if you hit the wrong button things disappear) and I had to re-download the Skype program in its old version. The window eight version of Skype is pretty but functionally not user friendly. Everything is not on one screen and you have to move from page to page to do anything.The only hope is that Microsoft will do a rework of Windows 8 or offer users windows seven to download. My suggestion is to download windows seven before you put all of your files on the Toshiba. The computer is a good one.
