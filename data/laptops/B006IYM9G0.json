{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Awesome laptop, and the price makes it even better!", "Author": "Heathishness", "ReviewID": "R2AL5J2WV6MZGQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Purchased this PC on closeout at Walmart for $270.00.  It has handled everything I have thrown at it well so far.  Those things include video format conversion, some gaming (The Sims, and some other first person shooter games), and lots of high profile video playback.I have not noticed any issues with overheating as I did with my previous laptop made by HP.  The screen is very bright and sharp.  Battery life is good.  Just a good all around computer, and incredible for the price.  It feels really sturdy, and I like that it is not a huge finger print magnet like pcs covered in glossy finsihes.  I really love that it has all Intel products inside.  I am not a fan of AMD, NVidia, etc since they have given trouble on almost ever PC I have owned.Less than stellar bits include speakers that are decent, but not super rich sounding like some higher end models.  They keyboard has a nice layout, and good key travel.  It also looks cool.  It is a raised \"floating\" chiklet style.  I only mention this as a possible downer because you will want to be mindful not to leave the keyboard exposed for long periods of time in a dirty environment.  Because the keys are raised it is easier for junk to get under the keys.  It is easy to clean it out with some canned air, or just by blowing on it!  But still something to be mindful of.  Lastly, the mouse is multitouch, which is nice especially as more and more software is optimized for such devices.  But it takes getting used to, and I recommend that you go through the pointing device settings to adjust the sensitivity to your liking.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not for gamers, barely for regular users", "Author": "Jonathan", "ReviewID": "R2CWCOTZDL3WTA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "bought this about 8 months ago from walmart the 1st 3 weeks the computer ran fine and i had no issues other than i noticed it got hot fairly easily(standard acer issue) and the keyboard was stiff here and there. within the next month i decided to play some games...., when i mean games i mean skyrim and halflife2 not chess. anyway it played them fine but 1hour in to either game and the system went black from overheating, i figured it was because of using it on my lap(still dont get how youre not supposed to use a laptop on your lap)tried it on a desk and it still overheated. i decided to use a cooling mat but to no avail it was too weak and i said to hell with if i pulled an old wind dance window fan and put it under it, luckly it works...kinda the things a bit ugly lol. anyway after i \"fixed\" that issue i noticed that a few keys were jamming constantly, this is an engineering flaw produced by a moron, this keyboard is one of the worst ive seen, it is a raised system on standard a standard styled plastic spring with no dust guard and plenty of space for hair wires/cables/crumbs and whatever to fall into it, only way to clean it without removing the keys would be alot of canned air, when looking closer at the springs they may look standard but they are much cheaper and very fragile, they also come apart easily causing jammed keys, which if forced will break and bend the springs.... obviously not good and rather frustrating. the next issue that i still have is ive filled the hd about 180gb so far and its started to lagg horribly during load up, ive even uninstalled and prevented unnecessary programs from running on startup but its not working, im asuming the hd is going bad i have yet to finish my first year so atm im waiting for it to finally die and if it doesnt then im going to tear it apart and build a liquid cooling system for it along with get it a much more reliable hd hopefully built better than the current anyway thats my 2 cents if you still wanna buy it i dont suggest any decent quality games on it. also on another note buy a pc from someone that alows a 90day return policy not walmart....", "Date": "July 5, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$499.99", "Features": "Screen Size: 15.6\"\nScreen Resolution: 1366 x 768\nProcessor Type: Intel\nProcessor Model: i3-370M\nProcessor Speed: 2.4GHz", "Name": "Acer AS5733-6607 16-Inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core i3-370M Processor, 2GB RAM, 320GB HDD, DVD Super Multi, Windows 7 Home Premium)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41IsfLWZ5oL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006IYM9G0"}}
