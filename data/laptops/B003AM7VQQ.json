{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The sweet spot on price vs performance", "Author": "Justin H. Legate", "ReviewID": "R2Y9KA0PP8NXFF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Asus K50AF-X1 is a solid performing laptop with a very reasonable price tag.  The dual core AMD processor and 4 gigs of ram make windows 7 perform well, even in the Aero environment. Additionally, the ATI dedicated video card enables this laptop to perform decently on modern games such as Left 4 Dead 2, Split/Second, etc.  However, it's not a miracle machine, so bear in mind you will have to run some of these games on medium/low graphics settings. However, it certainly runs rings around any laptop using intel's onboard graphics.  Burnout Paradise runs flawlessly at maximum settings with high framerate.  To get any better gaming performance out of a laptop, you would have to break the $1000 barrier, possibly even going into the 1200-1500 dollar range.  When I bought this laptop, it was on sale here at amazon for $550, and it has proven itself an astoundingly good deal.Win7 boots pleasingly fast, and the install is relatively clean.  It does come with some proprietary asus software loaded, but very little of it is memory resident, and what little IS is actually pretty useful, such as the on-the-fly ability to change between four power useage settings.  The laptop also has the option to use facial recognition software as a login alternative (via the built-in webcam), but this is mostly just a cool convenience gimmick and adds no real security features.  I am at a bit of a loss as to why Asus decided to partition the 500 gig hard drive into two logical drives, but that's a minor gripe I suppose.  The built in microphone performs acceptably for voice chat.  The button on the optical drive is protected by a protrusion just above and below the button, which I suppose helps prevent accidental pressing of the eject button, but it also means you pretty much have to get in there between the protrusions with a fingernail to press the button in far enough for the computer to realize you want to eject the disk.I also don't particularly care for 16x9 aspect ratio displays (I prefer 16x10), but I suppose that's what all the laptops are going to these days.Pros:Very competitively pricedGood graphics performance for the price rangeDecent sound for a laptopLarge hard driveGood keyboard, with good layout4 USB ports, two on each sideNo plugs in backWireless N and ethernet jack bothCons:High reflectivity on displayHigh gloss case gathers fingerprints/smudges like crazytouchpad uses \"multiple finger touch\" to scroll instead of having a scroll zone at the sides of the touchpad, which can be a little slow to respondNo HDMI out (does have VGA out, however)Minor gripes:A little annoying to push the button to eject optical drive16x9 aspect ratio (1344x768)Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.", "Date": "June 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Solid Purchase", "Author": "A.

This was not the issue.  My biggest concern was with the wireless ability, as my download speeds would constantly fluctuate, often times pausing altogether.

These two issues are unacceptable, so I promptly spoke with customer service, was given a return shipping label, and purchased this item instead: [...]On the plus side, the build quality seemed to be very good, and it did run cool and quite.

Shariat", "ReviewID": "R1DXMIQLJZJKK0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this computer not too long ago, and have been very happy with my purchase.  There are a good amount of features on the computer, especially for the price.  I particularly like the versatility and balance of specs, the Altec Lansing speakers (more on these in the edit), and that it has an actual graphics card.  The one-year accidental damage warranty and the \"IceCool\" technology that keeps your hands/ wrists cool as they rest on the computer while you type or use the touchpad are certainly nice, too.  Speaking of the touchpad, it is a pretty good one in my opinion, and I am fairly picky with these...  It doesn't have the scroll pad on the side, but it has a \"multitouch\" function that allows you to scroll by touching the pad with two fingers.  These are the features that stand out to me the most.I don't have strong cons to the computer really... The hard drive is only 5,400 RPM, and of course I would have like to heave seen 7,200 RPM instead.  I honestly don't perceive any real delay, though.  If I did intense 3D graphics, there may be a noticeable one, but I believe that just partitioning the drive to have a small, quickly searchable sector will make just about and hard drive work reasonably fast.  The keyboard will take a bit of getting used to and Windows 7 has some odd quirks (My screen saver would not come on when I purchased the computer; checking the box to ask for a password upon awakening apparently solved the problem).  This is obviously a problem with Windows 7 and not the computer.) The keyboard takes a bit of getting used to but is actually pretty good...  Certainly a bit different, though.The Turion II is another matter of discussion with this computer, because many people are discrediting it for the reported clock speeds from independent reviews.  This chip has a lot of features that make it a quality processor though, like the integrated memory controller.  The Turion II certainly handles the GPU in this computer better than a comparable Intel (...I would rather have this Turion II in this system than many others, including some Core 2s, though a Turion II Ultra with double the cache carainly would have been nice.  I give this computer 4.5 stars overall...  Bottom line: the features are great for the price.  I haven't seen another computer that has this combination of features in the ~$600 range.****EDIT Notes****  I have used this computer much longer now and got to experience the problem with the low Audio.  The speakers, even if you get SRS Premium Audio Sandbox (SRS's own software) to utilize these SRS speakers, is still mediocre at best.  I played with it for a little while and was satisfied, but came back with some Jazz tunes and they sounded horrible if the effects were turned up enough to hear.  If the effects weren't turned up, then hearing more than a faint melody would be near-impossible.  For this reason, I knock this computer down another half star to 4 overall.  It is a great computer, but the speakers are not as good as advertised, even if you buy software to utilize the speakers better; Also, throwing in a Turion II Ultra or triple-core Phenom II for a higher-end AMD based system would have been really nice, in my opinion.The computer I traded this in for: Toshiba Satellite L645D-S4036 LED TruBrite 14.0-Inch Laptop (Black)...  It is similar, has a slightly worse graphics unit, but the M880 shipset with the Phenom II processor make for a decent GPU that actually ranks a bit better than the one in this ASUS.  The Phenom II or the Turion II Ultra were my two choice processors for this replacement, and I decided to go with the 1.8ghz Phenom II.

If you have the web cam running while you're trying to play something that needs sound, you'll have a very difficult time straining to hear it. I haven't had any problems with the web cam quality, and I used it every day while studying abroad for 5 months.As with every new computer, the keyboard took a little getting used to because most laptops don't include the num-pad, but I found it to be a happy surprise.I'm an artist and I use photoshop pretty often. The program never takes long to load, and has a good response time with my graphics pad. I also like the size of the screen when using a program like this since it makes me feel like I'm working with more of a canvas than a computer.What I also found to be an interesting security trick that they have is the facial recognition for logon. The only problem with that is that it's extremely fickle! It never seems to recognize me despite the number of photos I've taken for the program to work. I'm happy to say that there is always the good-ol'-fashioned password access for the logon though, which is a never-fail. All in all, I'm happy with this product and would recommend it to the casual computer user.Update 8/28/12:I have encountered a new problem with this laptop.  I was working on it doing something very simple (writing out an email), and without warning, my computer shut off.  No blue screen of death, or a warning about a virus, just black..off.I called the Asus maintenance department (rerouted to a company in India), and I was told (without giving them much information about my computer) that I had a virus and that someone would be over to back up my files and give me a new operating system for $180.  (It doesn't even get to BIOS so it couldn't possibly be a virus.)Luckily, the computer was able to later turn on after tapping on the back of the computer and taking out the battery pack to do the old nintedo game blowing trick.  I was able to back up all of my files myself, but when I later tried plugging in speakers into the usb outlet, the computer shut off again.Not sure what this is all about, but I do know that the price I paid for this was not worth it.", "Date": "August 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "does stay cool, otherwise glitchy", "Author": "B.

I was puzzled but went to the site and downloaded it once again, then all was fine.Finally today, the 9th day of use, the system would not recognize wifi even though the other laptop in the household connected just fine. It also appeared that the Trend micro security system had been turned off, which means a virus or bot of some sort did get in, and I suspect it came that way, or that Trend is not an effective antivirus program.I went right to the Asus support phone number, was holding for about 30 minutes then was disconnected.That's it, I told myself, it is going back.

McAdams", "ReviewID": "R3248AU52Z1CDI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have bought, literally, 5 ASUS laptops and counting. And, you know what, I am done with brand loyalty. Brand loyalty is for suckers. I am also done with cheap laptops with cheap components.I bought this laptop, and the Seagate Hard Disc Drive (HDD) died and the screen started cutting out. I cracked it open and found bad wiring and faulty connections. I didn't cheap out on this model, either. I paid $550 for it when I bought it. I was expecting FAR BETTER quality than I got.ASUS *CAN* make a VERY GOOD laptop. However, you have to be willing to shell out the premium bucks if you want their quality stuff. Their Republic of Gamers (RoG) line is actually quite good. Their stock/discount lines (which is what you are looking at now) are where ASUS cuts corners to make up profits for the slimmer margins they must have on their decent lines such as the RoG line.Most of their \"bargain\" models come with Seagate hard disk drives (HDD) -- and, I am not kidding, almost every single Seagate drive I have ever owned, has died a horrible death within 1-2 years of normal usage. I have had 2 full-sized HDDs die on me, 1 external HDD die, and 3 laptop HDDs, in three SEPARATE ASUS laptops, die. ALL of them were Seagate drives. In contrast, the RoG ASUS that I have, shipped with a Hitachi HDD, which are widely regarded as one of the best on the market, and I have owned several, and NONE of my Hitachi drives have died, and they are still alive and kicking to this day.Additionally, the stock/\"bargain\" ASUS laptops tend to come with off-market/no-name RAM, and other components. As for video cards, count yourself lucky if you get a name-brand. Most likely you will be getting an Intel baked-in, on-motherboard video setup to handle your graphics. Although, this one, the K50AF-X1 does come with ATI name-brand graphics.Additional problems I have had with ASUS laptops in their bargain tier have been:-the little rubber feet on the bottom of the device which are supposed to balance the unit and provide shock absorption, fall off.-one of my ASUS laptops had a faulty connector where the AC power plug-in point was, and came detached from the side-wall of the laptop, making it impossible to charge the laptop anymore without ripping it open and soldering that connection point back into place (for the record, that model that happened to was the K53E-C1)-I have had frequent memory problems with many of my ASUS laptops until I ripped out their cheap RAM from no-name companies, and replaced it with top-of-the-line Corsair RAM or similar.-the amount of bloatware and shovelware that comes pre-installed on ASUS laptops is getting worse and more numerous each year.In short, you get what you pay for. If you are looking for a CHEAP laptop that you ONLY expect to be used for business/school needs, and it will be kept CAREFULLY on a desk, and HARDLY EVER MOVED, and you only expect to get 2-3 years out of that laptop (TOPS) before it dies, then go ahead and get one of the cheap ASUS models.If you want to be able to take the laptop around with you, also use if for gaming (or graphics work, or video work, or anything else RAM/Processor intensive) AND you want it to last AT LEAST 4-6 years (treated decently), then shell out for a top-line ASUS (like their RoG line), or get an Alienware, or a Samsung laptop.All of the top-line models are going to cost you more, but if you do the math, it works out as a better deal in the long-run. The \"bargain\" laptops tend to run $300-$500, and you will get 2-3 years out of them (less if they aren't treated VERY well). To get decent memory use out of them, you may then spend another $50-$150 upgrading the RAM (which is easy to do, even for non-technical people) and another $50-200 upgrading the HDD (unlikely unless you are a tech-type person). Multiply the base amount by 2, and you get a cost of $600-$1000 for 4-6 years of computing, having to buy a new \"cheap one\" half way through. And, if you DO upgrade the RAM each time you get one, then it will actually be more like $700-1300. If you also upgrade the HDD, then it will be more like $800-1700. So, at the most optimistic, you get a cost/year of $100-167 up to $150-$250, and a cost per year of $133-283 up to $200-$425 at the higher end of the scale, if you are an upgrader.But, if you get one of the more premium models to start with, at a cost of anywhere from $500-$900 (or even more if you really want to shell out for a power machine), then your cost per year goes down dramatically to $83-$125 on the cheaper end of the scale up to $150-$225 on the higher end. For 4-6 years of decent, hassle-free, computing (if you treat and handle the laptop well).My experience with this laptop, and 3 others like it, all from the bargain line of laptops from ASUS, has been to teach me that you get what you pay for, and cheap up-front isn't as good a deal as quality and pricier up-front. My Republic of Gamers laptop from ASUS has been working very, very well. It came with quality parts, and runs very nicely with no problems. The \"cheap\" laptops I bought from ASUS have all died on me within 2-3 years, and I regret purchasing all of them. I am on my last \"cheap\" laptop (model: A53U-AS21), and once it dies, that's it, I am not buying any more \"cheap\" laptops.2 stars for cheap components and shoddy workmanship.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "This laptop didnt last a year.

Right away, I noticed tiny sliver colored specks flickering randomly all over the screen, they were smaller than pixels and seemed to be a problem with the computer rather than the screen itself.  Then I installed WoW and kept getting blue screen crashes and error messages saying the graphics driver wasn't responding every time I tried to play.  I tried updating the drivers and some other basic fixes with no luck, I'm guessing that either the graphics card or motherboard was defective.The keyboard did stay nice and cool, but the air coming out of the vent was extremely hot and due to the placement of the vent the hot air was blowing up onto the lower screen casing, causing it to become hot to the touch.  It did boot up fairly fast, but it still took at least twice as long as the claimed 30 seconds.  Overall the construction was decent and the screen casing and hinges were very sturdy, though the disk tray was very cheap and flimsy.After spending three weeks trying to get the laptop to work, I contacted amazon and was given a return shipping label.
