One thing to realize is that it's not the fastest or thinnest/lightest laptop out there.  It's pretty much a standard laptop, with modest specs, but it does all many of the functions that a basic computer user out there is looking for.Pros:Nice keyboard - chicklet style, easy to type onTouchpad response is smooth and easy to use (note:  see con on touchpad below)Good screen claritySpeedy enough for most tasks (internet, word processing)Wireless connection was strong, fastFan is quiet and unobtrusiveDoesn't get very hot when on your lapCons:Case design very basic (rubberized?) and not all that attractiveTouchpad button is stiff - Hard to pushToo much HP software installed - Some of this will appeal to the novice user who may like all the toolbars, picture managers, dvd players, and software update programs installed.At first it seemed as if the screen was a bit blurry, but then I realized it was the opening HP setup window that looked bad.  It's not designed for the optimal screen resolution of the LCD panel.  I don't know why HP doesn't fix this, as it's the 2nd time that I've noticed this on HP laptops.  The screen looks nice in Windows 7.I'll try and update this review a bit more once I have more time with the laptop, including battery life.Overall, a nice machine in this price range.  You can find similar specs across the board with the different manufactures of laptops, but this would be a quality choice.", "Date": "October 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "good laptop for the price", "Author": "PGH", "ReviewID": "R1HVOFUBBEIPF7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You need to understand where I'm coming from - my most recent computer was running a Pentium 4 with 512MB of RAM and an 80GB hard drive.  That being said this computer is a significant step up, and I think it's great.  I think it's also important to know what I'm using this computer for....I work in a hospital and use this to log on to the hospital system, use Microsoft Office, and surf the internet.  For these applications this computer is perfect.  I've had it for about 1 month and have had no issues.  It does come loaded with a bunch of HP software which can be uninstalled so that's not a problem.The battery is listed as 4 hrs...it probably doesn't last that long - I haven't officially timed the battery life but it's probably closer to 3 hrs.  The case is plastic, the cold startup time is fast <30 sec, the wake from hibernate time is close to 3 seconds, the display is clear; the keyboard is easy to type on.  The only thing that took me some time to get used to is the touchpad as it does not have any defined boundaries and the buttons are a little stiff.  I seemed to have gotten use to both and for me they are minor issues.I think the computer is ideal for any student or person who has similar tasks to the mine (listed above - probably the vast majority of people).  I'm not a gamer and don't intend on using this for playing high intensity video games or doing a lot of photo/video/music editing.  This computer is probably not suited for that type of work.Overall I'm very happy with the product.

Second if you buy it at the Amazon price during a holiday season you have been robbed.

While not a gaming computer it is fast enough for some of the simpler online MPGs. I actually got dizzy with how well it kept up with game graphics. My only issue is I wish I could get a 500 Gb hardrive but you can always buy one later at a reasonable price. It is also a great workhorse laptop. I do freelance writing and this computer is a pleasure to work on and helps me find and organize files easily. The mouse pad is iffy and I wish they kept the left and right click mousepad buttons separate. Otherwise was one purchase I am very satisfied with.

To compare, during the 2010 xmas season this computer was selling in the 350-400 range, something to keep in mind. This HP is an absolute-budget model, and the dual core AMD CPU, 3GB RAM, and large HDD makes it a fabulous value. I'm going to only highlight the negatives, because overall this laptop is great for day to day use:-Yes, the mouse button is terrible. You can get by it by setting the \"mouse\" up to accept a tap as a click. You can also use a bluetooth or wired mouse. Also, sometimes the mouse pad doesn't catch your finger movements, this is rare but it happens. The multitouch is a nice feature.-The biggest negative is the screen. There's no way you can expect a high quality display at this price point. Next to my macbook, this display is lacking (the apple also cost 4 times as much). The range and depth of colors isn't anywhere near what a higher quality display produces. Also, the viewing angle is narrow - i.e. if you and a friend are looking at the screen, both of you will see a fade at the outer parts of the screen.I'm into digital photography. If you are too, I would definitely spend an extra $200+ on a machine with a better display. Don't get me wrong - this display is fine for Internet, watching DVDs, TV, and the occasional game, but you get what you pay for.UPDATE. It's 3 3/4 years later and the laptop's video card died. I'll leave my previous review intact, but i'm extremely unpleased by this turn of events. It's a shame because performancewise, the laptop still feels fine, never had to reinstall windows, and has otherwise performed well. This computer only gets home use too - very little rough treatment. Had someone told me that the computer wouldn't make it to 4 years, I NEVER would have purchased it.

Unfortunately, the person's advice I took about buying this particular laptop was, as I found out later, not the advice I should have taken. My first laptop was an Acer and it seemed to last forever. I bought it before going abroad to teach for a year, and it was still in great condition when I returned. It continued to perform awesomely two years later until I accidently dropped it. This HP however, is very disappointing by comparison. The first week I bought the computer, I would plug it up to charge and would get a \"not charging\" response. This has continued, and despite phone calls to HP about the problem, the problem has not been resolved. The only assistance I am offered by HP customer service is someone a million miles across the ocean who sounds like they are talking through a tunnel who keeps me on the phone for an hour performing diagnostic tests and update downloads. Perhaps I just bought a \"bad egg,\" but after speaking with one of my co-workers who is Staples Easy Tech Associate, it's very possible that it's all computers in the \"G\" series. He made it quite clear that HP has stopped producing good quality products overall. How very disappointing since I'm stuck with this computer, and until now I've had a fairly high opinion of HP.

A line of 5 specialized keys at the left side of the keyboard are mapped to applications - so make a typing error and suddenly you're no longer in your application, but have the PC opening up mail,switching you to browser or a calculator and so on.  I can't simply hit one of the function keys -- you have to hold down a new key next to the windows key to do that.  Argh.  So frustrating.Mouse pad is the worst I've ever had on a laptop.  Not precise, not responsive.  Scroll bar on the mousepad is terrible.I suppose the laptop is ok, it does what I need it to do, but my problems with the keyboard has me cursing it heartily when I'm doing anything but checking email or browsing the net.  When trying to write a paper, I usually borrow someone's desktop.I bought it last summer, so by now I imagine there are some good deals on it, but for what I initially paid for it I felt pretty stupid.  Should have checked consumer reviews more carefully.Edit 10/2011 - The battery just wore out.  :  Don't think I _ever_ got a 4 hours from a single battery charge.

These are very capable PC's costing from say $329 to $450 or so that are perfectly good for most student and home uses but are rarely reviewed in the popular PC or computing magazines (they turn their noses up at them.)If you can get this one for around $400 it is a great buy, sometimes they go on special sales, I was lucky to get one for $379 plus tax.It has 3GB of memory so you should not have to add more for the probable uses (yes, memory is supposed to be the best way to speed things up, but for most users even adding memory above 3 or 4GB rarely pays off.  If it came with only 2GB then adding is probably a good idea if your machine is slow)It also has a few nice features that might be lacking on computers a little less expensive - like a third USB port, card reader, webcam. It also has an HDMI output and cd/dvd labelling capability but I have not used them.Some caveats: the keyboard is laid out a little differently and does not have a number pad, and the mouse pad takes some getting used to (it can be turned off) and the buttons on the mouse pad have to be pressed farily hard.In use I found it plenty fast except you might not be able to play the more advanced games or more than a few applications at a time.When you get this machine or any other Win 7 machine, be sure to have about 15 DVDs on hand and 2-3 hours to make the recovery DVDs, rescue DVD that can restore it to factory condition if you cannot boot, and if you add any of your own software then make system image DVDs that will include your program changes.

This laptop does all of these things just fine!My only gripe is with the keyboard. There is no number-pad on the right, so you have to use the number keys along the top. I think this was done to keep the laptop compact. The designers have added quick-launch keys down the left side which do things like a quick-print, or launch the calculator, webcam and email. While this is a nice thought, these buttons soon become annoying if you are used to buttons like Shift, Tab, Ctrl and Caps Lock being furthest to the right. My wife touch-types and really doesn't like the keyboard layout at all. Also, to use the F-keys (essential for many PC based games) you have to hit an 'Fn' key, then the F-key, which is a real inconvenience.So all in all, it's a good laptop and seems quick and reliable, but a poor keyboard design spoils any chance this laptop had of me giving it five stars.", "Date": "March 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Needs Work Right Out of the Box", "Author": "D. Allen \"Mr. Mojorisin\"", "ReviewID": "R3J4SZID33LFWV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I must admit that I'm extremely happy with my new laptop, but it took hours of work before I could manage a smile. I purchased it for $350 at a local store, and I expected it to perform as well as my son's similar Toshiba, purchased earlier at the same store for the same price.Right out of the box, this thing was unacceptable. I expected the video settings to be maxed out like they always are when you pull a new one out of the box, and I expected some bloatware. But I wasn't prepared for bloatzilla, track pad problems, and the fact that it seemed like it was choking on something, causing animated aero goodies to studder, and everything else to run slow. I was seriously considering returning it.Who decided that putting the track pad under the outer case, instead of building it into it, was a good idea? Since the pad has to sense your finger through the case, the typical factory settings don't work (at least the ones HP had didn't). Experimenting with the settings fixed things, but the fact that you can't feel where the pad is, means I'm always looking down to locate it when I try to  to sroll. There's not even an outline on the case to give me sensory guidance, and the surface is textured, as is the rest of the case. Hands down, this is the worst touch pad I've ever experienced. Fortunately, the keyboard is very pleasant to use.The performance issue was caused by two things primarily: If you guessed bloatware was going to be one of them, you were right. This thing had more bloat and crap installed than I've ever seen. I spent HOURS removing it. Much of it was starting up on boot. I also got significant relief by updating all of the drivers. I did the bios as well for good measure.I now have a machine that runs much better than my son's Toshiba. It even seems faster than my respectable desktop that I built three years ago with premium parts. If you are computer savvy, and don't mind spending several hours making it right, the end result is gratifying.

Average speed, average bundled software/shovelware, and average options. There is little else to say, other than it does what I expect.I do, however, have two complaints-- HP grossly misrepresents the battery life. I get 2-1/2 to 3 hours of battery life while surfing the web with a slightly dimmed display. There is NO way this thing could get the advertised 4 hours even with optimal energy settings. Shame on HP for this false advertising!What I really dislike is the touch pad. First, the Synaptics software is buggy. The cursor becomes totally unresponsive twice a day, requiring a re-boot to correct, and second... this is a classic example of form over function. The touch pad is indistinguishable from the rest of the palm rest. Sure, it LOOKS nice, (see pics) but unless you are looking at where your finger is on the pad, you easily leave the input area and the cursor stops dead. In other words, since the touch pad is integrated with the palm rest, there are no tactile boundaries to let you know that your finger is still in the input zone.  This may sound trivial, but it is a constant annoyance. Another issue is the left/right button is pretty stiff, requiring a hard press.The web is full of complaints about the pad and the battery. I guess for a price in the $350 range, most people can overlook these issues, but in the future, I hope HP gets more honest in reporting battery life, and that their designers consider function over aesthetics.Oh, on another note...

My problem is the battery last only about 45 mins. I have called HP's tech support and of course the remote test they run all say the battery is fine no dead cells in the battery. Buyer beware, you will not be able to take this computer to Starbucks or anywhere with WiFi without the power cord. On another note if you purchase a computer from HP be prepared to only speak to (English as Second lanquage) techs for at minimum an hour while they install updates and other crap unrelated to your problem all while you struggle with the language barrier.

All devices worked with no problems watsoever, and the Linux Minst distribution even has a compatible MS office suite.I wipe the initial install of any computer I buy, I hate all the bloatware the manufacturer's like HP and Dell use to fill the hard drives up with.

Runs Ubuntu.HPLIP and simple scan are WAAAY better than going through setting up HP solution center in windows for printing, in my opinion.This product was so frustrating to own, I  became quite  good at  pc maintenance and using other operating systems3. It's obviously not a gaming powerhouse, but i was able to play Oblivion on it just fine.CONS:1.BLOATWARE, DRIVERS- It comes with alot of useless software and I experienced random freezes like others have reported. A clean reinstall of windows 7 did the trick and it was worth it.2. HOT!!- This thing gets really hot, even when it was new it would overheat and the fan is quite loud. You can smell it and the vent tried to burn my neighbour's leg.Seriously, its that bad.3. BATTERY: The battery life isnt great and not too long after purchase, the battery needed to be replaced. This defeats the whole purpose of a laptop being portable, i was always looking for an outlet.4.Build Quality- After i got the hp warning message to replace the battery, the cracks in the frame got worse and worse. The plastic cracked from just opening and closing the  lid. The screen has finally given out and i am now typing this review on an external display.5.TOUCHPAD- Its the worst touchpad i have ever used. very finnicky as other users have reported.Overall I would not recommend this product, the battery life is not good, gets way too hot and is of poor quality in general.
