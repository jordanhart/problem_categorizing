I love how the charge connects on the side not on the back. Windows 8 is a bit of a learning curve but it easy to navagate. This computer is quite and processes at a fast rate. Would not buy if you are super in to graphics, but for basic gaming/ youtubing it is great.

The only drawback is the battery life.  It doesn't last quite as long as some other laptops.  Overall, it's a fine laptop for me (a college student and online shopping addict).  This would be great for anyone!  One more thing:  the picture is more brown than the actual computer.  You can barely tell its brown, only in certain lights.  But, the color barely even matters.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very Bad/Poor Warrantee service and support", "Author": "Fl.

I started having problems that degenerated till I no longer was able to boot. called the friendly Filipino?? warrantee service and after several hrs of trying this and that they said they would just send me the factory reinstall disk's. Tried reinstalling 5 different times with and without the friendly barely English talking girl's. Not able to do it....They then sent me a second set of disk as most of the time that was the problem??? Tried again to install with same results...Got the official permission to send it in for repair on my dime of course.....Just got it back yesterday, found the paper on what was fixed ( replaced the hard drive) Also had the check off sheet where it showed all the operational items that a functioning computer would require....All passed and were signed of. Fired it up and got the Seattle Washington background with the current Pacific time...I live in Fla, it was fixed in Texas.Ok not a biggie Clicked on that and got a screen with an Administer symbol with a password required??? I did not ever have a password on it at anytime.. They replace the hard drive and of course could not have got a password even if there were one! Called Warrantee and they of course after many hrs of unproductive blathering in pigeon English told me to do a reinstall with the factory disk they had sent earlier. You have two choices when doing an install mfg or a clean install....Was told emphatically I needed to do the clean install...Clean install did not give me what originally came on the computer!!! After several more talks ending with a laughing supervisor who said I needed to do the mfg install. I hung up in disgust and have been installing missing parts for the past two days...Lenovo? Never again!!

Boots up quick, keyboard is big, separate number pad is convenient.CONS: Touchpad is a little cumbersome, easy to hit it by accident when typing.  Audio jack is an audio/mic combo jack, not 2 separate jacks, which I didn't realize when I bought it.

A laptop is laptop but, I wanted to make sure my daughter had a good one for her first year in college. The \"preloaded\" software is a nuisance and I had to go in and remove it all before I gave it to her so she didn't get roped in to any \"free\" programs that she wouldn't need. :) I also have to say that because I have been solely a MAC user for years, that Windows 8 is nothing to write home about. When Microsoft \"updates\" it software one would expect a better experience with these \"new\" tools. That is not the case, it's the same old crap just moved around and more expensive.

The screen is bright, the battery lasts as long as I need it too (~4 hours). 2 USB 3.0 ports, and an HDMI out is awesome.  The Pentium processor is a lot faster than I thought it'd be.

So, there are over 300 gigabytes on the C drive that can't be used for critical data.  I also found out that if I repartition the hard drive to make it usable then the one touch recovery system won't work.This is a total configuration screw up.
