Wow, Ultra HD & blazing fast frame rates. The cooling is the best I have seen...have yet to over heat running 3D games all day. Two fans in the back, and I add a laptop pad with 2 fans underneath. Hot air shoots out the back of this F-117 stealthly laptop.The complaints that I have seen about the mouse button & keyboard are not warranted. Asus may have been listening and made a few mods...The keyboard is solid, not spongy like the video I saw. The single mouse button bar is the size of the space bar. It is rather easy to use acually. However, when gaming I think most of us prefere the extensions anyways, and the better models come with blue-tooth. Very nice not to have dongles sticking out.Asus even gives a few extra option others do not. Even though Windows 7 starts very fast on this machine, it has an option to do a few things under the program (without starting windows7). Such as web surf on an installed browzer that doesn't need windows. Also, picture viewing...oh, and Skype. 2 seconds and you are up and running!! Get the 2MP web cam, not the 1.2MP.Just remember to look for the 1920x1080 display, it is worth the few extra $$.Not much bloat-ware either.This thing does it all. The ATI GPU is fantastic... placed #10 over all...and that is compared to SLI and crossfire config. Simply amazing. This model is in step with Alienware and Sager in bringing you the best configurations for gaming experience.", "Date": "August 27, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Laptop", "Author": "Jos\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd Montiel", "ReviewID": "R3E8LDKPSQ7BL5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Laptop====== * Second ASUS computer, first a netbook (Great), now this laptop (Incredible). * I had to do a fresh install, too much bloatwareVendor====== * No shipping tracking * Arrived little late according to Amazon schedule", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Screen SO fragile, total insecurity", "Author": "ASUS user", "ReviewID": "R1ILFMFUNMWNHL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this ASUS G73J excited about its two year GLOBAL warranty and for its great reviews. However, within the first year of buying the laptop, I have had to send it in 2 times for screen repair. I am not talking about bright-dots. I am talking about TOTAL screen misfunction. It is a tempting buy because of its specs, but PLEASE do not buy this computer. For anyone, who depends on it for their work, especially if they travel abroad, their global warranty is false advertising. Repairs are only available at certain centers in the US and in other limited countries, making it almost impossible for users who travel outside of those regions to get service. DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND OF COMPUTER. I have had a much worse experience with this brand than with any HP, Toshiba, Mac, Dell or other brand of laptop I have owned.", "Date": "September 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great product", "Author": "trev", "ReviewID": "R1UZJMWZINFOO5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ive had this computer for 3 years now and love it I have never had any issues with it.
