IT DOES NOT COME WITH A DISK DRIVER OF ANY TYPE, instead it has another graphic card in that slot. Hope you don't accidentally make the purchase and rate another one star to this great laptop. The keyboard light is really amazing! And the 1920X1080 screen is stunning! Especially when I move my eyes from the old z570 to it. Also, the JBL speaker has the best sound quality I have ever heard from a laptop. I am not getting used to win 8 yet, and the mac-like tracking pad makes it even harder. It does have some little problem with jumping pointers. But my old z570's tracking pad has almost the same problem while I am trying to use it to scroll down a web page. So it is not a big problem to me. BTW, the 170w adapter is...HUGE... It is two times as large as z570's adapter.UPDATEI have been playing with this laptop for a while and have some new thoughts that I think is worth to share.1.It is beautiful but very easy to leave finger prints on, EVERYWHERE.2.The tracking pad area is better when I got used to it. I actually love it now,but I still hate win8.3.Usually they are very quiet, but on massive tasks such as gaming the cooling fans will roar! The sound is not annoying to me. The fans are doing great job on keeping the GPUs cool. Without help from any cooling pads,temperature is kept around 65 degrees(C) under full load at default frequency and around 70 under full load when I overclocked them to 925mhz core clock and 1250mhz memory clock.4.The SSD+HDD hard drive is using express-cache technology,which uses the SSD part of the hard drive as cache to improve performance of the HDD. Its not good as it sounds. You will need CMD to check if it works (which it should but didn't at first on my case and made me recovered the laptop to its original status to bring it on). If you don't know how to check it,relax, you don't need to either. Because the windows system rating of the hard drive is the same 5.9 when the express-cache is on or off. I did not use any other program to test the exact reading and writing speed,because there won't be much difference with or with out the express-cache I believe. So, if you want real improve on the speed of hard drive, buy SSD.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great", "Author": "Mathew T.

I wanted to come and help outweigh this other guy's rating because he was rating solely on an accident by Amazon and not the computer itself. It's pretty amazing and I will edit this and write more when I get to use it more.It looks great, it is fast and it has everything I want. I do have one qualm though. With the supposed bundled software I don't believe that it includes the software serial numbers... which means that the software is not actually bundled.Now just to find out if I can get a Bluray ultrabay drive.EDIT: This computer is shipping with the Synaptics touchpad, not the ELAN Tech touchpad so the problems are minimal. It's no Apple trackpad but it is much better than the flimsy piece of junk ELAN Tech is manufacturing.EDIT 2: The 16gb solid state drive is now failing in my machine already, however that's not too uncommon for a ssd. The problem is, Lenovo has mediocre customer service and left MUCH to be desired. However Amazon made it all ok by sending me the new computer first as I will send them this one after it arrives.

So I'll just break down plain and simple what I liked (but mostly didn't about this purchase).The GOOD: - Beautiful screen. Seriously the HD graphics on this screen are just phenomenal! Gorgeous and vivid colors. Crisp and clear. I've seen very few laptop at this price range that have such a lovely display. - Screen size. I'm the kind of gal who believes bigger is better and this translates to the screen size in my electronics as well. Now this is purely personal preference and does not matter for some people, but I  always find it worthwhile to pay more for more screen real estate. Hence my bad ass Note 2 phone, giant obnoxious tablets, etc. HOWEVER-- I find that this modest 15 inch screen (for whatever reason) feels wider than it really is. Does that make sense? Not really. But hey, I didn't feel jipped for stepping down from a 17 inch screen. - Sleek design. I really like the look of this laptop. Its this gun metal charcoal color, gives the appearance of metal rather than cheap plastic, and is just modern and sexy. Very gender neutral! - Red backlit keyboard. Its one of those features where you go: \"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE?!\"- Webcam is very crisp and follows movement well.THE BAD: - Ugh. Windows 8. I know some of you out there love it, but I've come to hate windows 8 almost as much as I hate Apple. Seriously. Even though its not difficult to learn, the functionality is needlessly convoluted and just plain blows.  HELPFUL TIP: Download the Poki start button, VERY cool little start button app that is organized, looks great, and has not installed bloatware to my knowledge. Infinitely helpful. - The AC adapter. God. WHY. This thing weighs more than a fat kid at a cake convention. Or Honey Boo Boo's mom. I suppose it only stands to reason that more powerful machines need a bigger brick, but in this case, bigger is NOT better. Its heavy, cumbersome, and to make matters worse the cord is ridiculously short. Which SUCKS because this thing needs to be plugged in all the time---more on that later. - Batter life-- or lack of it! Yes, no gaming laptop is going to last very long on battery, especially in gaming mode or high performance, but like many of my old boyfriends, its stamina just borders on pathetic. Even without gaming I'm lucky to get 2 hours on battery with this machine. Really. Expect 30 to 40 minutes of gaming before you have to deal with the stupid powerbrick all over again. - Bloatware. Yeah, almost every PC will have it, but I'm going to whine about it anyway. Took me a little while to scrape all this junk off. Lenovo likes to add all their little BS apps and programs on there that are useless.THE DOWNRIGHT UGLY:  - Lame gaming laptop. I was lazy and did only a cursory job of researching the specs before purchasing this laptop and relied mostly on slightly dated reviews. DON'T make my stupid mistake. While this is not a terrible gamer tool by any means, in my opinion its not worth the money. This laptop can only handle WoW (not a game that demands high performance) on Medium settings and don't even try to get it to perform well on other games. - The infamous TRACKPAD. I am GREAT with trackpads. I have friends that are married to their fancy laptop mouse and seem mystified with my near god-like skills with trackpads. That being said -- HEED THE OTHER REVIEWS ABOUT THE TRACKPAD! It really is dysfunctional, horrifically oversensitive, and even had a trackpad master like me swearing so profusely it gave me gas. There is almost no distinction between right or left click. Forget trying to zoom in or out. Oh--you didn't want to swipe to Win 8 app mode for no reason? TOO BAD. If you decide to go with this laptop, for the love of god get a mouse (which IMO defeats part of the purpose of a grab and go portable PC). - OVERHEATING. I believe part of this is due to me getting a bum device (more on that momentarily), but this thing overheats like crazy. Running a YouTube video? OVERHEAT. Browsing Facebook? OVERHEAT. Play a game? NUCLEAR MELTDOWN. I bought a decent cooling mat which helped a lot and I expect to use a cooling mat when gaming...but not when its on a flat surface and I'm barely breathe on it. - Quality issue! From what I've gleaned by talking with other lenovo laptop owners, there is a lot of inconsistency in the build quality of their products, particularly this model. Mine had issues from the start. Awful overheating. OS issues. Blue screens. Backlit keyboard going out. Games needing constant adjustments to be even halfway playable. Start up issues. OS updating issues. The list of crap goes on. Certainly a lot of these problems could be solved with some repair and maybe an OS wipe, but you SHOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THAT IN THE FIRST place. I baby my machines... this one had no reason to freak out.So there you have it. Some folks have had a great experience with this model and their advice should be considered too, but it just wasn't for me. Plain and simple.", "Date": "August 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "High End features for not so high end price - Tons of power for your dollar!!", "Author": "G.V.", "ReviewID": "R1N2SU8MC0FE8Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A couple of months ago I got interested in photography and video to capture my kids precious moments. My aging Macbook pro from 2006 could no longer render movies or manage large raw photo files efficiently. Rendering a small movie from AVCHD to a youtube compatible format took way too long and did it using additional programs. Also, my Macbook pro screen was fading and HD pictures or video just did not look right. So...it was time for an upgrade. I have loved the Mac experience for years and I looked at the new Retina display laptops from Apple. I wanted a 15 inch Macbook pro, but the $2000 price tag for their entry level was crazy. And the fact that the new Macbooks cannot be upgraded discouraged me a lot as it would not be future proof. The entry $2000 15 inch Mac came with a corei7 2.4 Ghz, 8 Gigs of RAM and a 256 Gigs SSD. I wanted 16 Gigs of RAM and a larger hard drive, but customizing the Mac to my desires was going to be way too expensive. So, I decided to take a look at the PC world again. Besides, Windows 8 was out and my experience with Windows 7 at work has been very acceptable. I was looking at ASUS laptops, Sony's and others. Out of good luck I landed into a review of the Lenovo Y500. I started reading more about it and was amazed at the features it had on paper, plus  the price tag was within my budget. It had more memory than the Mac, more storage space (but slower) and dual graphics cards. It also had a nice Full HD screen (Not as nice as Retina, but good enough). In summary (hardware wise) the Mac was only winning on the Retina display as the hard drive on the Lenovo could be replaced with an SSD anytime (And...the Lenovo comes with a 16 Gig SSD anyway for catching). I did read about the problems regarding the touch-pad, but for my intended use I was going to have a dedicated mouse anyway. I decided to try it. Bought it on a Wednesday and it arrived on that Friday. I opened it and was a little disappointed when I saw the size of the laptop and the power supply (Huge), but I quickly overcame that issue. I turned it on and configured Windows 8 (My first interaction with this Version of Windows). Windows 8 was nice and felt very responsive. Things had changed from Windows 7, but the laptop performed well. The hard drive did not seem as slow as 5400 RPM Hard Drives usually are....maybe the 16Gig SSD cache really improves things in that department. I shut down the laptop and started it again from cold. Windows booted up in less that 10 seconds...WOW. Now I loaded all my editing applications and started doing some informal testing....incredible...rendering is  super fast on this machine. The screen is very beautiful...some glare as it is high gloss...but overall very nice. Applications open instantaneously and... remember the touch-pad issue?...well....mine came with the updated touch-pad from synaptics and it works quite well.A few days ago I got a Hybrid Hard Drive from Seagate and replaced the original one on the laptop. I also installed a fresh copy of Windows 8 Pro and this machine now beats anything. It boots in about 5 seconds and on heavy intensive tasks it does not struggle and it does not get hot. It runs surprisingly cool at all times and the fans are very silent when they come on. Fantastic value. In the future I am going to put an SSD drive and it will scream even more. This is a very high quality laptop with top performance at a very fair price. And this positive review comes from an Apple fanboy who owns most apple products.

Like totally great. The screen is alittle smaller than normal 15.6 inch laptop. It does not overheat unless you do super hardcore gaming. I gamed a few decent graphic game the first time and it heated up near where your palms are leaning on, but after 4-9 games it stop getting warm. My laptop froze about 3 times and im still trying to figure out the cause of it. The only thing I can think of is that it is chrome. Freezing happened to my last laptop when I had chrome. It loads up in 3-4 sec, then log in. after logging in, loads up another 3 sec. In reality of it, you only have 22 gb free of solid state drive. and the other is like 800 gb. I don't know where the rest of the gb went. I dont mind I guess. I use an external hard drive. This is my first time using windows 8 and its different but im getting use to it. Honestly in my opinion, technology is changing so mind as well catch up with it. no need to stay with the window 7 . I always keep my laptop plugged in and not use the battery so i couldnt tell you how long it last. Info: if you are playing at home or using at home. plug the laptop in without the battery in the laptop, that way you arent overcharging your battery. I also use an external fan pad under the laptop and it stays nice and cool.The laptop also comes with a program that has an auto control for your fan so you can dust out the interior of your laptop. I thought it was pretty cool. It's under the energy management program.Shipping? I was irritated when my laptop came to my house. It was shipped how you buy a laptop at bestbuy or fries and it comes in a laptop box. Well,,, my laptop came to my house in a LAPTOP BOX, and by UPS. So you know, if I wasnt at home, someone knows that oh hey, you got a laptop in front of your house and no one is home. I can steal it. get it? So if you're expecting this laptop, I suggest you stay home the day you get it, or you gonna get jacked.Pros: fast, screen quality is clear, font size is small.Cons: Freezes at times.Update: Apparently Lenovo warranty does not cover software issues. Lenovo warranty only covers hardware issues. and one day fix for SOFTWARE is 89.00. yes, thats right, 89 dollars for one day fix and it covers you for your laptop not breaking down for only 3 days. yup, 3 days only. My laptop freezes and starting to have a black flickering screen and turned black. I dont know but I hear some models have this issue about leaving it on for awhile then when u do something, the screen turns black and flickers when u move the mouse.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent in many ways, but", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"retired programmer\"", "ReviewID": "R2M90E7GVTH5KW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Lenovo Y500 mainly to write computer programs.

Everything works satisfactorily until 4 months later. The laptop wouldn't boot and the error message points at a hard disk drive failure.Request #1: A quick and pleasant call to Lenovo and, two days later, I receive a replacement drive and reinstallation DVDs. The hard drive is used, below the specification of my previous drive... and started to fail noisily in the middle of the reinstallation procedure!Request #2: Calling Lenovo and asking for another drive, which I receive promptly. I install the drive (used parts and below specs again), turn the laptop on and... What's that horrible whining sound?! Conclusion: Yet another failed disk. And to be sure of my diagnostic, I extract an old drive from an old laptop. I successfully reinstall my Lenovo laptop and the old drive.Request #3: Calling Lenovo again. They want me to return the laptop. I make sure they understand the nature of the problem, why returning the laptop makes little sense and why I expect a drive with, at least, the same specifications as the one I originally bought. A week later, the promised drive wasn't there yet (and actually never arrived).Request #4: On the phone with Lenovo... They don't know what happened to the previous drive. They'll send a new one, with the right specifications. I didn't bother opening the drive when I received it, it wasn't the right kind!!! In the meantime, tired of waiting, I had bought a new drive at a local store. Unsurprisingly, it did wonder in my laptop.Request #5: Moving online to avoid being impolite on the phone. There, I go through a weird registration and realized all the limit of their support tools. I almost feel sad for the support people working there. I try my best to describe all the extent of my issues with Lenovo. The field limit to 150 characters don't help, at all. My request: A real solution, in the form of a real drive or a real check to cover the purchase of a new real drive. And, a couple of days later, I receive... an empty box?? After some head-scratching, I understand they want me to return my laptop... #FacePalm!!! It's time to share my story with the Amazonians.Request #6: I'll get to that as soon as I'm done posting this story.

My old Y530, at its death, had no battery life, a broken hinge, integrated graphics, and a fried HDD. The Y500 was a major step-up as it combined two features (high-end graphics card & portability) that I was looking for the most in my next PC.Pros:1. SLI. However, in order for a game to run SLI, it has to be a SLI-compatible game. This is a quick list: [...]If the game is NOT SLI-enabled, it will run on one of the two graphics cards.2. SSD boot-up. Not sure of the technical term for this - but this laptop has 2 HDD's (1 ~1TB HDD, 1 25GB SSD). Win8 is installed on the SSD, allowing sub-10 second boot ups EVERYTIME! I love it.3. Core i7 + 12GB RAM = :D I haven't come across a program (casual user, plays a handful of games (anything from Football Manager to Crysis 3/Skyrim/Far Cry 3)) that this laptop struggles to run.4. JBL speakers, (almost) full-size keyboard, 2 USB 3.0 ports, and other small features.Cons:1. GeForce graphics card can sometimes crash momentarily when you do some graphic-intensive activities. To fix this, you are supposed to install/update new drivers. But shouldn't it come with newly updated drivers in the first place?2. Size - it's heavy - and you won't believe me until you actually see the charger. It's the size of a brick (no joke!). The bezel around the screen is about an inch thick at the top and around 1/2 inch on the side.3. Not sure if it's a con, but the slightest of vibration to the laptop when turned off will trigger data recovery upon boot-up. it takes about 60 seconds, and a overall good feature, but when you need to use the laptop right away it can be annoying and frustrating.Other points:1. The touchpad can be a bit annoying at first, but I quickly got used to it after a month.2. the lack of a disk drive has not changed the way I use my laptop.
