{"Reviews": [{"Title": "WAS a really nice little laptop!", "Author": "R. Wall", "ReviewID": "R312IURLQUC6FM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had similar observations to what previous raters have had...smudges easily, partitioning the hard drive is not a smart setup, and battery life is okay, but quite a bit less than desired. The good stuff...I love the keyboard. It may feel a little cramped for those with bigger hands, but it feels solid; good quality. Thats important to me on a laptop since it's the part receiving the most interaction from the user. The mouse pad is great too. I love the soft, yet solid feel of the buttons. The size and weight are fantastic--super portable. The processor is quick in my opinion, although I don't play games or use graphics intense programs. The startup is a little slower than I'd prefer, but shutdown makes up for it. The design is very nice. Slick looking box, and very clean looking. I've had some trouble getting the brightness to stay down when I adjust it down while it's on the battery, but that may be because I don' know if I'm doing it correctly.  I've only had it for a week or so now, but I'll come back in a month or so to input any updates/revelations.UPDATE 1: Still running great. As others have said, the mouse pad does tend to get a little 'sticky' when your fingers are wet and the battery life is more like 2+ hours. Not so good. But still lovin' it. UPDATE 2: Can't get the laptop's power saving settings to work right. The screen brightness goes up no matter what I try to set it to. May be the Dell power saving software b/c this feature works fine on my wife's Sony Vaio. Aggravating. UPDATE 3: Fixed the video brightness problem with an Intel driver update. Works fine now. UPDATE 4: Laptop was on the fritz for several weeks then about a week or two ago, it just wouldn't turn on. Probably a bad motherboard because power and battery are good. Only 3 years old and I lost data too, unless I'm able to recover it. This is the second major problem I've had with a Dell so no more Dell's for me!", "Date": "May 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Function Keys Terrible. Touch Pad Touchy", "Author": "delllaptopbuyer", "ReviewID": "R16KWOUQZ4OX80", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Can you believe the Function keys are not function keys.  They are media keys!  If you want to use the function key as a function key you need to press FN first.  So to close a window it's not Alt F4.  It is now Alt FN and then F4.  I really don't like this!  Also the tap on the touch pad is very touchy.  It does not click consistently.  Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.", "Date": "January 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Dell Support Is A BIG Problem", "Author": "Living in D.C.", "ReviewID": "R34OUA59GX1KYP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received this laptop as a Christmas gift. My experience on the phone with Dell trying to get basic info was sooooooo frustrating I am returning the laptop.I do not ever want to deal with Dell again. I spent 45 minutes trying to find out which model was in the box I had received (not wanting to open it until I was sure I wanted it). I was told by sales support that my question was far too technical and I required tech support. It took me 45 minutes for someone to tell me \"the laptop you received is an Inspiron 14R\". Gee, that's extremely technical information!!! I can understand why it was so confusing for sales support particularly since I had the receipt, the order #, the customer # and ALL necessary info.What followed this mess was another 90 minutes trying to get a CRA (credit return authorization). Ostensibly, one is able to return a Dell laptop but the reality is quite different.I spent 2.5 hours on the phone with this horrific company. All the calls were routed to either India or Phillipines - I was lied to, hung up on and lied to some more. I am outraged and hope that Dell goes out of business. They really suck and should be ashamed to even use the word \"support\" with regard to their phone services.I am going to write a letter to the State Attorney General regarding their fraudulent return policies. I am also considering recording the phone conversations (need to check on the legality of recording calls that are overseas - I may not be required to follow US law) and sending it to Dell mgmt and the FTC. I think Dell mgmt would cringe if actual calls were published on the internet as the lying and obfuscating is so obvious and ridiculous. I felt like I was dealing with Nigerian scammers.Shame on you Dell.", "Date": "December 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "problems with the battery", "Author": "Oren Nahari", "ReviewID": "R2CSWH0OXC6XY7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "hello dear costumersdell is really honorable company and generally has good products.in my specific case, I recieved a PC with a problem in the AC adapter or/and the motherboardwhich cause a discharge of the battery.as they say here the battery lasts for up to 4 hours, but as I saw and as the costumer service of the company told mea 6-cell battery should stand for 1-2 hours.you should take it into account.nevertheless, the operation of the PC is fine,quiet and well designed. the price is very low and it is getting down each month.", "Date": "May 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Fantastic Laptop", "Author": "Michael E.
