The battery is huge and bulbous and sticks out in the back, which prevents the laptop from lying flat.  It also doesn't fit into laptop sleeves or cases easily because of the battery.  Rather unfortunate because I've been looking for a Windows 7 laptop for a long time and this one had the specs and price I've been looking for.Luckily, Amazon.com let me return the laptop without any hassle since it was not as described.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easily, the BEST computer I've ever owned.", "Author": "JC", "ReviewID": "R2LA297KSVENUD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "*** UPDATE regarding the battery ... this notebook has AMAZING battery life and as another poster indicated, it has a bigger-than-normal battery on the back of it.  I have no problem with the size of the battery and I would recommend searching for a photo taken from another angle that shows the battery.  I respect that others may not be happy with it, but for me, the battery size and life are well worth it, but respect other's opinions.  I also found out there is an optional lower-profile battery that is available from Acer.This notebook is the first notebook that I've ever had that literally plug in my office display, keyboard and mouse, use it all day and HAPPILY take it on the road with me without bringing the power adapter!  It is fast, very ultrabook like and is the best notebook I've ever used for business.  It does not have a CD/DVD drive and I'm totally okay with that.  The screen goes way to the edge, so no wasted space.  I'm not sure what else to say, other than speed, Windows 7 Pro, great battery life, and very light!", "Date": "November 27, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core i7-2637M\u00a0Processor 1.7GHz\n8 GB DDR3\n320 GB 7200 rpm Hard Drive, 64 GB Solid-State Drive\n14-Inch Screen\nWindows 7 Professional", "Name": "Acer Notebook NX.V79AA.004;TM8481T-9831 14-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/413Ors9H2hL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007XNQNSK"}}
