Two months down the road the whole top of the computer is peeling off from normal use. The computer is only 4 months old and it looks like it is 4 years old now. The quality of the materials is extremely low and cheap. This computer probably costs Sony $100 bucks to make.The interior hardware worked for two months and then the Wiimax adapter completely broke down. I called Sony support and they re-installed the drivers 3 times. By the third time the Sony rep said that it was a hardware issue and I had to send the computer to Sony for repair. You do not want to hear this with a brand new laptop.I have regretted owning this and am disappointed that Sony created such a bad product and charged us over $1,000 for it. Had I known the hardware and the exterior of the laptop was going to peel off like a sticker then I would have gone ahead and bought a cheaper brand, perhaps an HP or a Lenovo.Sony never called me back to help with the repair and they never sent me any additional information after contacting them 3-4 times.", "Date": "February 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK -- just slow", "Author": "Amy Hunter", "ReviewID": "R1L0WE3ADWFR5Q", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this looking for a windows 7 platform and a DVD drive in the laptop and and I-5 processor.  I've never owned a Sony before but I think it's all the bloatware that makes it confusing to use.  I need to work with it more to clean some things off but it's not my best purchase.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "fast and light", "Author": "playday05 \"nhonlinemom\"", "ReviewID": "R385Q9R6NYMJA4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my husband is a cto.  he liked the guts of this computer. better processor, better battery, faster than an i3. i liked the size and light weight.
