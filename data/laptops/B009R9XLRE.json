I chose this laptop due to it having a numeric keypad, four cores, 4GB of DDR3 and a 500GB HDD. The bottlenecking point seems to be the GPU. It can generally get pretty hot when you're playing a game, and it used to shut off from overheating, but that problem disappeared after I bought a cooling pad, which you should be using anyways. Battery lasts OK - give or take three hours while gaming or rendering, and up to five hours when doing web browsing or other small stuff. No touchscreen, but I wouldn't buy one of those since I don't like Windows 8. The touchpad recognizes multi-touch commands.I'd recommend this laptop for people looking for a decent machine that they can game with for the next few years, for under $500.", "Date": "April 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "birdlady777", "ReviewID": "RX1IEJFJJ70XX", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Keyboard replaced in 1 yr,  alot of lag, poor  sound, paid 429.00 , should  have  did more reaserch  before i purchasedit.Bought at  best buy.

Not really any lag problems consistent with lower end laptops, but Skype does freeze up the computer anytime I even load it up.

I have owned Acer products in the past and had great success with them.  I should have returned the laptop the next day when I hear my sales person tell another shopper, stay away from this one.  I wish I had.  Its now on its second mother board and the widely problematic atheros wireless adapter.  Last warranty from geek squad city left me with a new unidentifiable motherboard without any serial number and a wireless card that lasted 6 days.  When it does work the AMD A8 Quad 4 processor is quit nice, but it spends more time being repaired and windows reinstalled so I never really get to use it.  Being bought as a christmas present, best buy or acer wont do anything except keep changing parts.  STAY AWAY FROM ACER AT ALL COSTS IT IS NOT WORTH IT !", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B009R9XLRE"}}
