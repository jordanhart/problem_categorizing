{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Unexpectedly Impressed", "Author": "B99", "ReviewID": "R3A25HWOFRVB0R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a lightweight (3 lb or less), touch screen, Windows 8, around the $400 mark laptop for my Mom who is a light PC user, definitely requiring user support often. After purchasing an Asus 10.1 notebook, after about 2 hours I was sure this was not the right notebook and I needed to find something better. The Asus had the Centrino processors which turns out run hot so the fan was loud and the laptop would be hot pretty much the whole time, and it only had a dual processor. Even after optimizing it and removing some power consuming apps, the poor laptop still seemed to struggle to run. Plus the screen was tiny, not a touch screen hence the $300 price tag. After some research attempting to remedy the Asus' shortcomings, I purchased the Acer Aspire v5 after going to Best Buy and actually handling the laptop. I was impressed at its weight, how slick and well designed it felt, and most importantly, it felt like a real laptop not a toy (like the Asus). What a great purchase! After spending 3-4 days configuring it and learning the new W8 OS and all these apps I've never handled, I am a Windows 8 convert and definitely considering buying an Acer Aspire for myself.Pros* Price - What a great price for such a loaded laptop! Paid only a little over $400!* Design - Solid notebook, slick design with all necessary ports* Weight - Light weight, about 3 lb with the battery* Touchpad is a dream. You have the mouse click options which are missing on some other notebooks. It is sensitive just enough, it is not in your way when you type, it doesn't jump around your apps when you touch it. Best of all, I did not have to load any additional drivers or updates for the touchpad.* Touch screen - although the resolution isn't super high on paper, what a great crystal screen! Love the colors, vibrant and clear from the box, didn't have to adjust anything. And the screen is so well designed for the touch, it is sensitive just enough to get you around without many errors.* In the box - laptop, power cable, basic manual for start up and warranty, dongle for VGA* Fan - super happy with the low quiet fan and cool laptop, all that with a quad processor laptop! Kudos!* Sound - speakers provide loud enough volume for my aging Mom with slight hearing issues. Good clear sound as well.Unknowns* Battery - don't know, have not had the battery below 75% so I don't know how long it would take to drain it.* Performance - not sure if this isn't due to everything being new and having to load for the first time, but some apps and screens take 5 to 10 seconds to load. Hoping this would change once everything is configured and used at least once. It could also be due to our W8 inexperience, time will tell. The laptop does start fast from sleep mode, although when you open the top it doesn't start automatically, I have to press the power button for it to wake up. There is probably a setting somewhere about that, but that's not a big issue right now.Cons:* Probably the only tech spec that is below the rest of the components on this machine is the camera. Grainy images and video. Oh well, all the rest is great so hard to complain given the price.* Had to install 30+ app updates which took several hours. The notebook was loaded in Nov 2012 so by July, all loaded apps had new versions pretty much. This is not an Acer or laptop issue though, can't hold it against them since this is something we have to do regardless of what brand and laptop we purchase.* AcerCloud - is a good idea but boy, there was NO information about what and how to use it, and after loading a bunch of its related apps to the laptop and the mobile devices, I had no idea how to move files/photos from the mobile devices to the laptop, just no way to do that based on the few menus in the apps. It was super frustrating, and even research online on the acer forums was useless. After wasting about 2 hours, I moved onto SkyDrive. After 30 min and some research, it still didn't seem intuitive enough so I did some more experimenting and settled on DropBox. What a relief, the app came with a short and sweet guide, telling me exactly how to load my files from one device to the other and the app itself was pretty intuitive as well and didn't require 4 different apps (like the AcerCloud), just one! Plus it kept giving me more and more free space the more I used it and the more devices I added. Hope this solves my file sharing needs long term!* Would be great if the touch screen laptops came with a Touch Pen also, makes it so much nicer to browse the screen. I used one that came with another purchase I made on Amazon. Again, not really an Acer issue, just a nice to have suggestion.Other* Windows 8 - bit of a steep learning curve and there were no tutorials or instructions on the laptop or at least not that I easily spotted. There is definite initial frustration with the OS, lasted about 3 days. But after installing Windows 8.1 preview version (which brings back the Start button of sorts), after finally finding the Control Panel (it was frustrating hunting for it or accidentally stumbling on it but not knowing how to knowingly get to it), I was more and more comfortable with the OS and seeing its advantages.After moderately learning how to get around myself, I setup up the Start screen and apps for my Mom. I then braced myself and showed my Mom how to use her new laptop, expecting a long drawn session. It was quite a surprise to see how well she took to using the touch screen and figured out how to get around! She has always had trouble with the mouse pads and even more with the touch pads, it was a relief to see that she easily handled the gestures on the screen and learned how to get around surprisingly faster than I expected. She loved the screen clarity and the vibrant colors. After that, I knew I had the right laptop!In conclusion, I am very impressed with this quiet, lightweight, hard working, crystal clear machine! After a bit more tweaking and learning more about the OS and the apps, I am sure it will be even better! Will try to provide an update after some longer term use but for now, we are definitely in the honeymoon phase!", "Date": "July 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Small Computer!", "Author": "sarahtejas", "ReviewID": "RDBQQHL2FYMZ5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this Acer touch screen computer about two weeks ago and have been really really happy with it. It's extremely portable -- so small and light it fits in every bag I have. And the touch screen is cool even if I don't use it much (I typically dock into a monitor and keyboard so don't really need touch). And I am using it as my primary work computer so it's on ALL day with lots of open programs, which the processor is handling no problem. I think the only drawback is getting used to Windows 8. Because I use the computer for work I am in Microsoft Office programs all day and those work in \"classic\" mode so the switching between tiles and classic is a little annoying. But even with that I'd totally recommend it to others. Am even considering buying another one for my daughter as her first computer!", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not A Bad Laptop...Quite Surprised", "Author": "Brian A. Wolters", "ReviewID": "R2W5MPIJ2E1EH5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "When looking at sub $500 laptops, it really is hard to find something that will be everything to everyone. If you get a feature here, you lose one there. I went into the Aspire V5-122P thinking I would see this but I had to admit, I am rather impressed.First up, I downloaded all of the Windows Updates and removed most of the bloatware that is loaded on the machine. I also let Microsoft's Windows Defender take over as my anti-virus and spyware protection. There were well over 60 updates and due to the slower nature of the hard drive, it took a good while for me to get in \"working\" order to my tastes.Next up, was to set up an account for my 5 year old daughter with Family Safety, which I highly recommend to anyone with kids.After I got it where I want, it was time to put this thing to the test. The first thing I did was load steam and downloaded 2 of my favorite games: Portal and Portal 2. I knew Portal would run fine but I was rather surprised that Portal 2 ran with near the highest settings with hardly a stutter. The graphics card handled the game quite well.Next up, I connected my Bluetooth mouse for gaming. Strangely, the Bluetooth device was disabled in the device manager so I had to enable it. Once enabled, I selected the Bluetooth icon in the system try and it opened up the \"Modern\" Bluetooth manager. I powered on the mouse and I was in business. Worked like a charm. (using the Microsoft Sculpt mouse.)Microsoft Office ran well and the \"modern\", Windows 8 apps opened with decent speeds.The screen is nice but when compared to say, the Microsoft Surface, it isn't the greatest. The colors were better than expected and the touchscreen was very responsive. I found myself using the touch screen much more than the track pad. Don't expect to use this outside much as it isn't terribly bright and it has a lot of glare.Audio was OK and even at 100%, it could have been a little better.The processor is only a 1GHz dual core AMD. I've always been an Intel guy, so this is my first AMD. It scores a 2.9 experience rating and I did see some issues with video playback on Facebook as it was choppy. It is 64 bit and allows access to all 6GB of memory, so for general use, this lap does fit the bill.About the only gripe is the hard drive speed. It does seem to take a good while for some applications to open. It is 5400 and in tandem with a slower processor, it will make for a slightly sluggish experience.Bottom line, I can recommend this laptop. Compared to an ASUS in the same price range, it beats it hand down as far as having brighter colors and having a better GPU. Windows 8 honestly should only be experienced with a touchscreen and you will get that and more with this ASPIRE V5-122P.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Maybe a 2, maybe a 4. I had to split the difference.", "Author": "Mark Freeman", "ReviewID": "R26NT2HWUZGFH7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This was  a difficult computer to review and  I struggled as to how to rate it given the price point at which it is sold.  I gave it 3 stars out of 5, with the price point being the only thing that almost pushed me to 4. If it weren't for the price, I would honestly put this more toward 2.  Overall, it is a very low end laptop that doesn't seem to know whether it wants to be a laptop, a netbook, or a tablet. One note, I have broken down a separate section for Windows 8. While I don't blame the manufacturer for the issues, when you buy a laptop, you are buying the OS also. As a buyer, you need to be aware of what you are getting.The good:- The screen, while small, is actually very pretty. It has nice resolution and a strong display. It is very bright and easy to read. Text is crisp.- The touch screen seems sensitive enough that I don't feel like I have to push through the screen.- Overall, the computer is very light weight. Given its size, this is no surprise.- The keyboard feels pretty nice. It has the modern chicklet style keys and although they feel a little cheap, typing is quite easy on this device. It is a full size keyboard. Given the size of the computer, this is really nice.- The rubber pads on the bottom of the computer are very non-slip.- It comes with a 500GB HD and 6GB of RAM.- The touchpad is responsive.- Supports 2 finger scroll.- Backlit keys.- Came with an external monitor adapter.The bad:- The plug is very large and takes up more than one spot on a power strip or battery backup. It looks like it was made to have exchangeable outlets, but I often struggle to find plug space and taking up two plugs is unacceptable to me.- The batter is garbage. I booted up the computer and let it sit without using it. In 3 hours and 30 minutes, the batter was close to 20% left. THIS IS WITHOUT USING THE COMPUTER! Given that the battery is so bad, it will need to stay plugged in almost constantly.- Slow charging time.- No built in ethernet adapter. A separate connector must be purchased.- The base of the computer feels very cheap compared to the screen. I would be scared to accidentally drop this computer.- The trackpad is very, very cheaply made with too much play.- No media drive. However, this is becoming more and more common.Windows 8 is hands down the worst version of Windows I have ever used. It takes forever to boot the computer to a working state. I found it difficult to find even the most common of task, like logging off and shutting down.  If you are buying a Windows PC any time in the next year or two, this really, really needs to be a consideration you make.The saving grace for this laptop is the price point. Acer seems to know this is the low of the low end. It is mass produced cheaply and reflects that fact well. If you are looking for a cheap little laptop to take on vacation or if your computer use consist of only surfing the web or maybe occasionally playing some music or movies, this will probably do it for you. I would personally consider looking at a nice tablet instead.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A BIG step up from the Acer Aspire One...", "Author": "asiriusbee \"Dana~\"", "ReviewID": "R1NX3CSLLEZFMP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "UPDATE (27 NOVEMBER):So I've had this laptop for quite a while and just wanted to let everyone know whether or not it still works for me. It does, but I did swap the HDD for an SSD. The A6-1450 processor is slow loading pages 'n stuff, but then the process will kick in (The clock speed can be brought up to 1.4 GHz but this only works correctly during single-thread load. The clock speed slightly decreases when more than one core is stressed). Basically, all the reviews on this processor says the 1.4 GHz will kick in when multitasking, but in order to activate it, you must use the balanced or high/maximum performance battery profile.Before, I could only get about 3 hours with the non-removable battery, so in order to maximize the battery life, I bought the \"second\" battery that recently became available on the Acer website. Now I can use the laptop all day without lugging around an external battery charger!!! I would say that now I get about 5-6.5 hours - depending on the power plan that I'm using and how bright the screen is. When set to \"balanced\" or \"power saver,\" I get more battery life, of course.Summary: when prices come down, I will eventually buy another laptop. One that has a 13.3\" screen, 1600x900 resolution, backlit keyboard, touch screen and a faster processor. The laptops that meet these requirements are quite pricey right now, so I will stick with this \"enhanced\" netbook. As a student who is a moderate user (web browsing, checking email, using MS Office), I am quite happy with my purchase.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE (15 July):Amazon did a price drop about 3 weeks after I bought this, and when I tried to get a price match, I was told they only do price matches up to 7 days after the ship date. To me that's just poor, poor customer service!!!______________________________________________________________________________________UPDATE (1 JULY):Just installed an SSD Kingston Digital 240GB SSDNow V300 SATA 3 2.5 (7mm height) with Adapter Solid State Drive SV300S37A/240G to help improve system performance and what a difference! Webpages load faster, downloads are quicker, copying to or uploading from a flash drive - the speed in which these things are done have all dramatically increased!!!Best browser to use with this laptop? Firefox & Chrome. IE is slower for some reason; the webpages load slower and IE locks up a lot. If I don't close the tabs in IE, then I get the \"not responding error.\" With Firefox, I can just minimize the browser and not have to close all the tabs out!I suppose I could have tried to buy a $800 laptop that had an SSD or an i5 or i7 processor, but it's hard to find one that comes with both. You usually have to choose - and pay more. Also, this subcompact laptop comes with a touchscreen & a backlit keyboard!  Not to mention that it's a joy to type on the keyboard and the portable size is what I was looking for.__________________________________________________________________________________________INITIAL REVIEW (27 JUNE):PROS:- lightweight- 6GB SDRAM- backlit keyboard- touchscreen- very quiet (no loud fan noise)- processor works quite well for light gaming, web surfing, Facebook/Twitter; MS Office tasks- option for a 2nd battery (not yet available, though...)- includes adapter (ACER Converter Cable) for VGA connectionCONS:- processor can't handle heavy programs: AutoCAD, etc.- downloads take longer than usual, especially if you're trying to download a large file... or if you are trying to download multiple files at the same time.- can't have many tabs open in IE10- only one (1) USB 3.0 port- no HDMI/Ethernet port; need adapter (ACER Converter Cable - sold separately)This works for me because I don't 'do' gaming; I only use this laptop for a little bit of this and that: school work and web surfing. Battery life is about 5 hrs on the Power Saver setting. The 11.6\" screen doesn't bother me. Also, I am a proud owner of a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 (16GB, White) which I probably use more than this laptop! So between this laptop or my Samsung tablet, I have plenty of \"processor power.\"For those looking for a cheap, portable laptop to do general everyday tasks, then this subcompact laptop is a good choice - it's really great for those who have a desktop or larger laptop and just need something more portable for around the house or for a trip to the coffeehouse.For those who need more horsepower, an Ethernet connection and a bigger screen, should look elsewhere for their computing needs.Hope this review helps, folks! ;-)", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Word of caution.

With Admin rights those malware can easily infect deep within your \"recovery partitions'! meaning, these's not turning back and you're royally screwed.

This image will allow you to revert back to this pc's state in time, and in perfect working order.Sometimes system recovery doesn't solve your problems so having secondary backup plan like Recovery Image is key.________________________________________________________________________Not optional, must practice these 3 regular computing habits.#1  (Install McAfee Antivirus, which is now free starting 2014, per Intel's 2014 Keynote at CES) or Paid programs such as Kaspersky Internet Security 2014  is the leading software in the market today. $50.  These programs scans your system automatically, so set it and forget it.#2  (Install MalwareBytes/free, scan your pc every month with this program or sooner when you feel like your system is sluggish or seeing webpages poping up that you didnt click)  Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.#3  (Install Superantispyware/free, Scan pc every 2wks)Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.Its ok skip a few scans between months, although not advisable, especially if your a heavy web surfing maniac spending 2-3 hrs daily websurfing not just facebooking.  But please dont go without using all 3 programs more than 5-8 Months in between scans.________________________________________________________________________Another way to avoid  spreading your personal information out there into the wild unknowingly is to un-google yourself.yes ladies and gents! google or yahoo especially yahoo LOL..... but google is key here.Microsoft sells Primarily Software.Apple sells Primarily HardwareGoogle sells neither, that's why their products are so CHEAP, once they suckered in their backdoor ridden ecosystem, Google Inc. sells Primarily Everything about YOU!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Steps in upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1  (2-3hrs)Key here is to ensure your windows 8 is fully updated before upgrading to win8.1Therefore repeatedly \"check of updates\" on windowsHow to upgrade to windows 8.1 for dummies.Step 1: Go to Metro and not desktopStep 2: Start typing : \"Control Panel\"Step 3: Click \"Windows Update\" > \"Check for Update\"Step 4: install updatesStep 5: restart computerStep 6: Repeat step 1 -5 until result \"no more updates\"Step 7: Run HP Update client, install all updates from HP to ensure all drivers and bugfixes are updated.( or whichever OEM you may have, lenovo,dell, sony etc.)Step 8: Uninstall your Antivirus Software (important) then RESTART PCStep 9: Go to Windows Store and upgrade to 8.1Step 10: leave computer on for 2hrs as it upgrades.Step 11: Repeat Steps 1 - 7Step 12: if you're not a complete fool, 8.1 upgrade should be straight forward. \\After steps 1-8 ONLY THEN you should install WIndows 8.1 at the marketplace. Goodluck.(note: steps above removes a lot of failures users experience after 8.1 update)___________________________________________________________Not many want to shell out their dollars on Office 360  if all they intend of using is standard word processors.you can use a free web version of office calledBing.com search:  \"MS Office Web Apps\"just sign in with the same  MS Account user name used on your PC.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop", "Author": "David Cavazos", "ReviewID": "RPH7Y9R3B8YW6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for a desktop replacement computer that I could move around the house and use in low light environments.

Now don't get me wrong, it's not a super blazing fast machine, but it is by no means slow. I would call it efficient. And you can't beat the fact that you have a touch screen Win8 laptop for under $400 now. I totally recommend this device for all uses, other than a gaming laptop and video editing.There are two semi-minor cons with this device, one is the touchpad (not a fan, it's just a bit awkward to use), and the screen resolution makes icons and Windows (Browsers, etc) too large for the screen.

I enjoyed it!", "Author": "Joseph Siegler", "ReviewID": "ROVXO7T6ZO4Z1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First thing is first.  Like virtually every other laptop sold these days, it came loaded with a bunch of Trialware and bloat that nobody really wants.  The first thing I did after firing this thing up the first time was proceed to remove all of the stuff on here that I don't want.  I know the companies try and do these things to create their own \"unified experience\", but to me, Windows itself does a fine enough job, so the first thing I do is remove all of this stuff.  Here is a list of everything I removed from the laptop:  Acer pictures, Acer media detector, Acer cloud docs, Acer Launch manager, Acer PowerManager, Acer Recovery management, Acer Cloud portal, Acer identity cloud, Acer live updater, Office 365 trial, McAfee Internet suite, Soluto, Norton online backup, Nero back it up, Spotify, & Wild Tangent Games.  Now Spotify wasn't so bad, but in the scenarios I will be using this laptop, I won't need Spotify, so I let it go with all the other stuff that was preinstalled on here.So that's the first thing to do.  Uninstall all that stuff, and then spend a ton of time running Windows Update.  To me, that's essential when starting with any new laptop.  Once I got all that completed (which took awhile actually), I then proceeded to start working with the laptop.As other reviewers have said, this is a lower end laptop, and to be perfectly honest, I can see where some people might have issues with this.  But it is all down to what you expect to do with this laptop.  Are you planning on trying to play big high end games on it?  You're looking in the wrong place.  Are you looking to to video production on this?  Nope.  What this laptop is is a lower end, basic laptop, that still manages to pack in a few good features that one would expect to find on higher end laptops.  To me, the selling point was the touch screen.The screen is quite nice, actually.  It's an 11 inch monitor, so we're not talking one that half a dozen friends can watch at once, but for personal computing, it got the job done for me.  I didn't think I'd be happy with an 11 inch screen, but I think the touchscreen compensates for that.  That brings me to Windows 8.  I've been a Windows 8 user on my desktop since it launched about a year ago.  I don't have the issues that a lot of people do with Win8, I'm mostly a keyboard user, so it worked for me.  However, on this laptop, the touch screen really makes Windows 8 shine.  The touch screen makes the interface a lot different.  In fact, since I've started using this laptop, I've not used the keyboard a whole lot.  It's not like I'll be using this like a tablet, mind you, I have used the keyboard, but for the work and activities I've done, I've used almost exclusively the touch screen and the \"Metro\" interface, and I really like it here.  A lot.Here's a few comments on some of the usual bullet points people make about laptops.1) Keyboard - It has a nice lighted keyboard, which was a surprise at this price point.  It doesn't really add anything feature wise, but it's nice to look at.  \uf04a2) It's lightweight, but doesn't feel \"cheap\".  It does feel a bit like Acer attempting to \"borrow\" the feel of a 11 inch Macbook Air.3) There is no CD/DVD drive in here.  That too is not a surprise as most laptops are headed this way, given we're close to an all digital computing life anyway.4) The screen.  While it's true, the screen resolution isn't that great (1366x768), it doesn't seem to play that way when I look at it.  It's got a nice look to my eyes.5) Battery Life.  Now this is probably the weakest point.  The battery life is between 3 and 3.5 hours.  A lot of new laptops have double that, so this is the weakest point.  For me personally, though, this is replacing a laptop whose battery lasted at most 20 minutes from a full charge, so I'm quite happy with 3.5 hours.  But I realize that's just ME.  I know where some people would be upset with 3.5 hours.  If that's a problem for you, then you might want to look elsewhere based solely on this issue.6) This has USB 3.0 ports on it, but I can't test those, as the only USB 3.0 device I have is a portable hard drive that's always plugged into my desktop computer.7) Power saver mode in Windows will affect the CPU rather noticeably.  Which also could affect one's perception on how the laptop performs overall.  If you plug it into the wall, then you can jack up the performance.  But if you're on a battery, keep this in mind when thinking about it.  Of course, you can always jack up the performance while on battery, but it will impact further the battery life issue.8) Has 500Gb  of HD space, and 6GB of ram.  Oddly enough, a website scan from Crucial told me this laptop took up to 10Gb of ram at max, but the system specs said 8.  So I'm not sure what the true total memory capacity is here.9) Had some nice sound.  I don't think we're talking Bose super speaker kind of sound here, but for a lower end laptop, it did well enough.10) It has a webcam, which I'm told is not that great, but for webcam chats, do you really need 1080p video?  Seriously?11) There are no HDMI or Ethernet ports.  But most people will use this wirelessly, which is probably why they opted to save a few bucks on the ports, I'd wager.Bottom line: If you're looking for a touch screen laptop for basic computing, this will work for you.  It's not a dog by any stretch, but you should go into this with proper expectations.  This new laptop runs circles around the laptop it is replacing for me (an over decade old model), so I'm quite happy with it.  It's not a screamer, but if you're not taxing it too excessively, it will get the job done.  But understand what you're buying when you buy it.  Don't expect performance like a $2000+ MacBook with Retina Display here.For the price you pay for this, you get a decent value of features for the price.  Again, if you need high end performance or big time gaming, this isn't your device, but it will get the job done for most average computer users.", "Date": "August 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fixed this computer for my brother - buyer beware it comes loaded with junk", "Author": "John Mahoney \"jhmblvd\"", "ReviewID": "R3AIAGF7HZNJ0D", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a tech and was asked to clean the system by my brother.

My last Acer (Acer One) beat the pants off of it in battery life, but I knew that when I bought it. Windows 8 hasn't won me over yet either and the touchscreen is nice, but I rarely find myself wanting or needing to utilize it. Really want the extended battery and dock that was promised to be released, but it doesn't look like Acer is in any hurry. Overall this little laptop is great for what I use it for- a content viewer. For content creation I use a triple screen desktop setup with Windows 7. Adding ReviverSoft's Start Menu Reviver definitely helps adjust to Windows 8 and makes it more usable, but I'm still partial to 7. Great little portable though- after the One and the V5 I don't think I could ever go back to a 15\"+ laptop (previous to the Acer One I had an Alienware m7700 17\" DTR). The SSD and a $5 HDMI out dongle were the only additions I made.Pretty happy with this laptop and the build quality and chassis rigidity is spectacular- much better than the Acer One. The keyboard is better as well- but the keys are a bit smaller, so it takes some getting used to.

Please read for some necessary adjustments.", "Author": "F-Rod", "ReviewID": "R3S4X9Y0U48PTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Been looking for a laptop to replace my trusty HP Elitebook 2530p, a 13.3\" Win7 machine. Although I love my 2530p, it's older, doesn't have USB3.0 or HDMI. When I saw this deal, it was time to strike. Bought this on a one-day Amazon deal, $378/shipped.It was the laundry list of goodies that piqued my interest; 11.6\" IPS touch display, HDMI (via mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter), USB3.0, backlit keyboard, quad-core with dedicated GPU and Windows 8. 500GB 5400RPM HDD and 4GB RAM were par for this level of laptop. The other features seems pretty high end.The screen is nice. It's bright. It's got excellent contrast levels and yes, even though it's 1366x768, the 11.6\" screen is very forgiving. That resolution at this size looks perfectly fine. This will do till 1920x1080 becomes available in an 11.6\" or 13.3\" screen, which seems to be very expensive at this time. But no worries, the screen is GREAT. Touch works well. I'm not a huge fan of Windows 8 Metro, it's OK...but won't replace desktop mode anytime soon.USB3.0 on this system is fast. I created an Acer Recovery USB thumb-drive on two separate USB sticks. You'll need at least a 16GB drive for this. On USB2.0, it seems to take forever. With USB3.0, it was allot quicker. If you want to connect this to an HDTV, you will need a mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter, found one on eBay for $5/shipped. Works perfect. Love the backlit keyboard. Been wanting one for a while and finally got one. Works great. Will shut off by itself if you don't use it. You also have the option to disable it.OK, the APU...this is AMD's terminology for a single die that contains both the CPU and a dedicated GPU. An Accelerated Processing Unit. The CPU and GPU handled most everything I threw at it. Let's be realistic, you're not going to be running Crysis3 on this. But, I was able to load up Sine Mora and GRID. Both ran decently at normal or low settings. VERY SUPRISED by this. I did have one issue with VLC media player, when I went to run 1080p video, it would occasionally drop a frame or two. As an avid video watcher, I could easily tell. After some investigating, I figured it out, VLC media player does not use the GPU for decoding by default. 720p videos had no problems, it was the larger 1080p videos that taxed the CPU, at times spiking it to about 100%. Once I enabled GPU decoding, the video stutter/dropped frames problem went away. I could not get this to drop a frame. After enabling this CPU load was about 2/3 lower. By the way, this laptop is QUIET. Even with the fan running, you can hardly hear it.Another thing, as you may or may not know, the power settings in Windows will dramatically adjust the CPU power on this system. So, in Power Saver mode, you can actually see the CPU go down to about .580GHz or 580MHz...yes, the battery will last longer, slightly over three hours. I've seen the power meter say 4.5 hours. At High Performance mode, the CPU idles at 1.0GHz and will boost to 1.4GHz.The keyboard feels light and snappy. Smooth keys with good feedback. The mouse is fine. I'm not a huge fan. There is some play and it sounds cheap.Windows 8, well, I'm not going to bother going into this. I have an opinion that I will keep to myself. BUT, to make Windows 8 usable in any form or fashion, you must download Windows 8 Classic Shell. It brings back the Start button. Without this, how would I have known applications were even on this system? I just don't get it. But I am so glad Classic Shell is installed. It makes this laptop so much more functional. Metro is cute but, productivity wise, it is useless to me. I already have an iPad3. I have absolutely no use for Metro. With Windows8 Classic Shell...it's a PC again! Yay! Also, Windows 8 Task Manager is AWESOME. The best Task Manager EVER! If you want to nerd out, dive in and enjoy. Stats/graphs on everything. Good stuff.Anyways...that's pretty much it. Oh, one other thing...4GB of RAM is OK. It's not great, but it's not bad. I never found myself hitting the 4GB ceiling, so I don't think it will be a problem. The 500GB drive is a 5400RPM, which is too bad. 5400RPM is so 1994. It works fine. I'm just used to an SSD in my gaming rig and work and home laptops. I think an SSD would rock in this thing. BUT, I would lose capacity. At this point, I prefer capacity over speed. Once Black Friday comes around, I will be tempted to purchase a 256GB SSD for this. Be warned, if you plan on swapping out the drive, you will need a 7mm drive. I tried slapping in an SSD and could not fit it in. There is a flat cable that goes over the HDD, if the new drive is larger, the cable will not make it to the connector on the mobo.I was very close to returning it due to the rendering issue which was not the fault of the PC but rather the application. Now that it's been resolved, via the application, this laptop is a keeper. And no, it's not an Macbook Air, but for a third of the price, it's such a great bargain. I would totally recommend it.UPDATE---08/10/2013Still loving this little laptop. One thing I wanted to mention, my laptop shipped with BIOS firmware 2.03...I checked Acer's Support site and found the latest update to be 2.08. Unfortunately, Acer does not specify what the fix is when you update the BIOS. No mention at all. Bad on Acer. In any case, I tried to update to 2.08 and could not, had to be on 2.06 first. So, I gave that a shot. No luck...upgraded to 2.05, then 2.08. Worked fine. I'm not sure what this will gain you. Just wanted to let you know. UPDATE BIOS AT YOUR OWN RISK. If you lose power in the middle of updating it, you will essentially brick it and have to send it back, with all the data, to Acer and they will not get your data back.It goes without saying, I removed any and all crapware; hi there Norton. There's not much, just a couple of things. Also, ran a hard drive test. On battery setting \"Performance\" I was seeing a Max read speed of 122MB/s. For a little crappy 5400RPM HDD, that's pretty good.UPDATE---03/06/2014Still have this laptop. It's my main go-to laptop around the house. No issues with laptop at the present time. I replaced the HDD with a Samsung Evo 240GB SSD. The difference is night and day. The machine is very fast. Boot time is easily 8-10 seconds, if that. When using Chrome, if you are in Battery Saving mode, when you scroll, you can see a little bit of stutter depending on the complexity of the website. If you go into High Performance mode, this goes away. It's a dual edge sword because battery life goes way down in High Performance mode. So there is a trade off. The external battery is available, but is $100 from Acer. Part number is NP.BTP11.00G.The IPS display is beautiful. The backlit keyboard is a must. I still don't like the mouse pad because of the level of play. You can tell there is a bit of space. I usually tap it lightly and you can hear it kinda click. I'm tempted to put a thin piece of foam between the mouse surface piece and it's backing. That would resolve the issue.In any case, it's the best small/thin laptop I've owned. How can you beat this for what I paid? I can't wait to see the follow up.BTW, USB 3.0 and the mini display port are awesome. I use a cheap Mini Display port to HDMI adapter to run the video to my A/V system. Works great. I'm in HTPC heaven with that. And also, you can actually do some light gaming on this thing.

It was a perfect size for carrying around, and I loved the touch screen. I bought mine from Staples and purchased a Square Trade warranty with accidental damage protection. (Incidentally, after I had it for a month a family member knocked a glass of water on it, and it was ruined.)PROS:The touchpad was very nice, and the keys were responsive.The laptop was the lightest computer I've ever had, and it was exceptionally portable.It came with a VGA adapter. I purchased an HDMI adapter from a third-party, and that worked great as well.CONS:The processor is not designed for heavy lifting. If you need to run a processor-intensive program (like image editing, software compiling, etc.) then you should look for a machine with an Intel Core i5 or Core i7 processor. If you are running Win 8 apps, or using basic tools like word processing and the like, you probably won't notice a huge difference, but when you start trying to do any heavy lifting at the processor level, you'll feel like you are crawling along.The battery life is right around 3 hours, in my experience. I wished it were a bit longer, but I knew about the lower battery life going into the purchase, so I wasn't disappointed, per se, but the 3 hour span was a bit more inconvenient than I expected.Not waterproof (just kidding). Ok, the true thing to note here is that the battery is totally enclosed in the case. There is no way to remove the battery. When my SIL spilled water on the computer (while it was running), the keyboard immediately stopped working, and my only option was to press-and-hold the power button to shut the device down. I wanted to remove the battery right away and let the device dry, but I didn't have the correct-size of screw driver to get out the screws (and taking off the back cover voids your warranty, at least with some laptop manufacturers). In any case, I think the computer might have been saved from permanent damage if I could have removed the battery, but that was not an option for me. (Luckily I had the Square Trade Warranty, so me and my SIL are still friends. :)When I had to replace this computer, I decided that I wanted a computer with a little more oomph in the processor and a longer battery life, so I didn't re-purchase this little beauty, though I did really like it and would buy it again if I needed something that didn't have to be a workhorse.", "Date": "November 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "SLOW", "Author": "jack", "ReviewID": "R3FTMJLHER9GBD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This was just a slow computer.

Why these PC makers continue to degrade their PC's with redundant and unwanted stuff is a wonder to me? As for Windows 8 I don't like it and never will. I do well with it because I stay within the classic desktop and rarely go into the \"modern\" desktop environment. I doubt Windows 8.1 will solve many of my own complaints. Don't get me wrong, Windows 8 is stable, fast and probably more battery conserving then Windows 7. I just don't care to juggle between two different user interfaces on a notebook.

It's not the fastest, most powerful thing out there, nor does it have all the bells and whistles, but as a good, basic touchscreen laptop, this gets the job done at a reasonable price.Pros:Screen: If you're wondering why you even need a touchscreen, then I'd guess you've never had the joy (insert sarcasm here) of experiencing Windows 8. Windows 8 was designed with tablets and touchscreens in mind, and thus is a nightmare to maneuver through with just a track pad or a mouse. If you're running Windows 8, you want a touchscreen. This is a very good touchscreen, nice and responsive, with great resolution and good colors to boot.Touchpad: The touchpad on this laptop is fantastic! It's very responsive when you touch it, but not so sensitive that it engages when you're only trying to type. You can right click and left click just like with a mouse, and you can use two fingers to zoom in or out. This is definitely one of my favorite things about this laptop.Keyboard: I spend a lot of time typing, so the quality of the keyboard is of huge importance to me. This keyboard has a great feel to it, and despite the compact nature of the laptop itself, doesn't feel too cramped or small. I love that it's backlit, and I was super happy to find that it has dedicated Pg Up and Pg Down buttons... my other laptops don't and it's such a huge pain.Price: At just a little over $400, this is definitely one of the lower-priced touchscreen laptops out there. Yet it has a very high-quality feel and sturdy construction... nothing about it is \"cheap\" except the price.Cons:Speed: This laptop was unbearably slow when I first got it. Now that we've removed a lot of the sample software and other pre-installed junk, it's better, but still definitely a bit sluggish. Opening anything takes a few seconds longer than I'm used to, and starting up from a total shut-down takes FOREVER. Everything seems to run well enough once opened, so it's not a huge problem, but if you're an impatient person like I am, you may find this a bit annoying.Battery: The battery life of this laptop is just so-so. It gets me about 2.5 hours and that's it.  Amazon's product description states that you can add on an external second battery, but Acer doesn't currently sell them in the US. I run on wall power most of the time so I don't really mind, but if you need extended battery performance, this may not be the laptop for you.CD/DVD Drive: It has none. I know many people don't have a need for them nowadays, but I miss it.Bottom line? This is a good laptop for the cost.

I just want something that starts up and loads programs quickly without getting buggy and unstable. This is my first experience with Windows 8, and quite a learning curve, although after downloading an app with hints, I'm soldering on a bit better. Still, I prefer Windows 7, and please note that any comments I make about the operating system and/or the Microsoft programs are directed towards them and not the manufacturer. I leave it up to the individual to decide if a laptop with Windows 8 is a good fit for them or not - although I suspect eventually we'll all have to learn it, like we had to (learn) with all those other operating systems of fading memory.Out of the package, set up was a real breeze. Plug it in (it charged to full capacity fairly quickly), turn on the power button, set up your passwords and what-not. Connecting to WIFI was a snap, but after that you have to let things take their course for all the updates - both Windows and most of the installed programs/tiles. I recommend only updating one app at a time, things really bogged down while all that  downloading was going on. I like the backlit keyboard a lot, I'd find that very handy in a darker setting. I haven't tested the battery to the very end of life before it needs charging, but I've gone several hours before getting a low life warning.This does come with an email program, but I'm unable to use it. It says it's not compatible with POP servers and I've just switched everything over to a new email that is POP only, and I'm not going through that again. I did try the free trial of MS Office, but I can't see myself using it on this unit. I'm from the old school of typing, where you went to class and learned to type at the speed of light, and the keyboard on this laptop doesn't seem to like that kind of typing (same as the Fire, it's all hunt and peck). I find myself slowing down and hitting the keys hard to get my keystrokes to stick. If I wanted to type anything more than a sentence or two in a comment box, I'm still going to turn on the desk top and use Word there. Same for Excel, the program worked fine on the laptop, but I can't fathom trying to work with an accounting based spreadsheet without a ten-key. *shudders*I was able to get my music transferred fairly easily, and have tried it in Amazon's Cloud Player app as well as the Xbox program that comes with the laptop. I ended up liking the installed music program a lot when I figured out I could set it on a sidebar and I get images of the artist playing, plus suggestions for other titles to listen to. The speakers sound a bit tinny, but much improved after I plug into it with some earbuds/headphone.I'm not a huge gamer, but I have downloaded some solitaire programs and a Mahjong app from Microsoft - the latter being a bit on the *twee* side for my tastes, I much prefer the 247 Mahjong app on my Fire. I like the MS solitaire program a lot, and the graphics are great on the laptop, but the ads that come with the free app are annoying as you-know-what, plus it frosts me that I'm asked to sign into a Microsoft account to play a game of solitaire (I just click don't sign in and then play).Back to the programs/tiles, I haven't tried them all (don't Skype, Twitter, etc.). You can click onto IE explorer from the desk top, but I really dislike the way that app works. If you like the old-fashioned IE experience, go to the desk top (there's a tile to click to take you there), and you'll find the blue \"e\" button at the bottom task bar. I've also downloaded Chrome and have been using that as well. YMMV. I did find a very helpful tutorial for Windows 8, and I will post a link to it in the comment field.I haven't shopped laptops and prices much, but this appears to be an excellent value in its price range, and one I'd recommend if Windows 8 is a good fit - those not open to change and learning new things might not find this the best fit, but I'm having a good time getting to learn a thing or two. Plus kitty likes to be a lap kitty and she hates it when I'm at the desk top for too long, like I am now.Final note:  I did have trouble on a couple of occasions getting this laptop to power on, just got the Acer screen and then nothing, but I haven't had this problem again, so fingers crossed it was just something I did.", "Date": "July 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Add $300 to the price to buy a new hard drive and switch back to windows 7", "Author": "Nicholas Sowden \"Nick\"", "ReviewID": "R2F29K8Z5066HC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Oh my gosh, I am so frustrated with this computer!

I am writing this review only because of a couple of odd reviews criticizing these model laptops.One reviewer mentioned \"This will not ruin AutoCad.\"  No. It will not. This is a sub $500 laptop. It sits on the shelf next to $1,400 to $1,700 laptops that probably will run AutoCad.  If THAT is the capability you need to have, open your wallet up further and get one designed for that purpose. This Acer Aspire will happily run PhotoShop, Illustrator, Word, Excel, Acrobat and 98% of the software 98% of the people need to run.  I even use PowerDirector 10 video editor on mine.  It is slower than when I run the same video editor on my desktop PC with the i7 CPU and a killer video card but the video card cost more than this entire little computer!I have a 6 year old Dell XPS M1210 laptop.  It was one of the fastest laptop PCs available at the time I bought it.  This Acer is very similar to it in speed.  Yes, there are MUCH faster and more capable laptops available today, but you need to start ADDING $200, $400, $600 or ever $1000 to get one of these faster ones.The touchscreen on this one is beautiful.  The battery lasts around 3.5 hours.  I've seen better battery lifes and faster laptops, but not everything at this low of a price.. The screen is exceedingly clear and bright.  Knowing this inexpensive little PC will run those two programs is probably more significant to 98% of consumers that having them be concerned that it will not run a CAD/CAM program.The build differences are quite noticeable. The Dell was built like a tank in comparison.  it had access doors on back for each item: battery, hard drive, memory stick, wi-fi and bluetooth cards. These new laptops are ultra light weight.

I have a Windows 8 phone, which I'm very happy with, and I was excited to have similar functionality in a PC. Is laptop is a nice compact size, is quite lightweight, and seems decently built. The bottom plastic seems a bit cheap, but the overall package is pretty nice. It has one USB 3.0 plug and one USB 2.0 plug along with an SD card reader and one mini-HDMI port (no DVD-ROM; not unexpected on a compact machine). It has 1.0 GHz Dual-Core AMD processor and 6 BG of DDR3 Memory.This brings me to my first, and primary issue, with this machine. It seems like it should be up to basic tasks, but I have been quite unhappy with its speed in conducting even simple processes; it almost seems as if the processor is outmatched by the operating system, as things tend to be slow in opening and prone to failing. It was horrific to start with, but a system refresh helped some, but not enough. I had to do a complete system reset (thankfully the software to do so is included) on this machine, which I had had for only two weeks! That helped a bit more, but it's still pretty underwhelming. Even web browsing is slow and awkward (it takes twenty seconds sometimes for internet explorer to get itself open and onto my mail home page), even over a high-speed connection (it doesn't have an ethernet port, so I don't know if the wi-fi modem is partly to blame; I know the connection itself is plenty fast on all of my other devices and computers). It takes between twenty and forty (!) seconds to open iTunes. That's just plain unacceptable. Playing music using iTunes over the Bluetooth connection to my speakers is touchy and prone to skipping and hitching. If everything on the machine is close except iTunes, it usually plays relatively well, but if anything else is happening at all, it starts skipping and pausing and even breaks down sometimes (certainly no web browsing or working while listening to music). And that's just a simple task of playing music over Bluetooth. I have had to resort to plugging it in with a physical cord. I haven't run any more involved programs, but I don't hold out a lot of hope for something like PhotoShop. I was primarily hoping to use this PC for web browsing and playing music. And it's only so so at even those basic tasks.A few other observations. I'm rather unhappy with the track pad, which isn't particularly responsive (I found clicking and dragging to be particularly difficult). The screen quality seems quite good. The touch and multi-touch are relatively responsive, and the picture is bright and clear. The built-in speakers are more or less what you would expect for a compact laptop: not too good. The battery life seems very short, especially with media applications like music or video. And if I leave it hibernating for more than a day, it's dead, so it even bleeds power at a pretty good clip when not running.Overall, this is okay as a cheap laptop, but I found it to be underpowered. I felt like I stepped back a decade or two (!), having to wait for programs to open and websites to load. These most-basic tasks should be effortless, but on my machine, at least, they aren't. Maybe I've got a lemon, as others seem to be very satisfied with performance. I will continue to try resolve the serious functionality issues, and if I make any progress, I will definitely update, but I wanted to register this \"minority report,\" as it describes my experience.

I had two Acer laptops before this one, and the one I just bought (with the money from the refund) is an Acer.Bottom line: this is a great value for the money and if it wasn't for the malfunctioning trackpad I would definitely still be using it, and I would have rated it 4 or even 5 stars.", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Acer is the BEST!!", "Author": "dERRICK l hEAD", "ReviewID": "R3AYTZOUZKQMXM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent!!

Acer Aspire V5-122P-0863 Touchscreen Laptop is quite similar to a Samsung Chromebook or MacBook Air in size, weight, and appearance except for the beautiful glossy touchscreen and the black undercarriage. The physical build is sturdy and attractive. The backlit keyboard and clickable touchpad function well and the touchscreen is very responsive. The processor is more than adequate.Unfortunately and surprisingly, battery life is disappointing for such an extremely portable package, around four hours depending on what it's being used for. Dimming the screen helps though cycling the battery doesn't. Acer needs to do something about the battery life.I don't like the position of the power button on the outside edge and there are only two USB ports. In addition, to connect it to a monitor, a proprietary adapter cable available only from Acer is recommended--but they don't seem to be selling it yet. There is no ethernet socket: either use the excellent WiFi or get a USB-to-ethernet adapter. The AC adapter and plug are combined, which is nice, and the plug itself can be interchanged for international use, but it can hog three sockets on a power strip. It may be possible to get another power cable--but that shouldn't be necessary.So overall, this is definitely a nice if imperfect piece of hardware with great quality in feel and function in all major aspects other than than battery life. However, it comes with Windows 8 installed, and that is where problems arise.My rating is for the hardware only and does not take into account the software. However, the operating system is an important part of the computing experience so it does require some discussion.Over 10% of the 484 GB hard drive is filled with the OS and pre-installed software. Initially, it took over eight hours to remove junk software and download and install all the Windows 8 software updates with occasional problems requiring trouble-shooting and lots of mandatory restarts. The Windows software was recent, installed about two months before I updated it.It's just as difficult in use: Windows 8 seems to have a split personality between tiles and desktop and is very unintuitive in organization and flow. It is difficult to switch between programs or go back to the desktop and it can takes a lot of swiping and clicking to find something. Worse, sometimes I just can't ever make it do what I want it to do. For instance, when playing music through an online service, the music stops when the window is minimized to switch to another program so I can't read and listen to music at the same time.In the end, I would recommend this little Acer Aspire computer--but only for someone who knows from experience that they want to use Windows 8 over another OS and for whom four hours of battery life is sufficient. I have a Mac mini and a Samsung Chromebook and have not found any reason to prefer the Acer Aspire for any particular use, primarily because of the operating system, although I like the backlit keyboard and the beautiful touchscreen very much.Again, my rating is for the hardware only and does not take into account the software.", "Date": "August 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Good (Not Great) Touchscreen Laptop", "Author": "Roger N.

So my primary uses for the laptop are school, email, and various office programs. I'm not a gamer, so I haven't tested the laptop other than to play Cut the Rope which was pre-installed (and excellent!).As a student, one of my primary concerns with a laptop is battery life. This is one of the few areas where the Acer is weak or mediocre. Fully charged it seems to have a little more than 3 hours of juice. These days that's surprisingly short. I wonder if the backlit keyboard drains it a bit- I'm not sure.Another concern of mine is weight and size. When I'm carrying textbooks with me I don't want to unnecessarily add more weight. This Acer excels here. It's light, small, and easy to handle. The power adapter is a bit bulky at the plug, but still smaller than any other laptop power adapter I've ever used, so that's an improvement.It's worth noting that this does NOT have a CD-ROM drive. That's becoming standard for laptops this size and tablets, but it may be surprising for people switching over from larger devices. Everything is going toward cloud storage and programing, and this laptop comes with Acer Cloud software. However, like everything else with this machine, very little instruction is offered on how to set it up, how to use it, and what to use it for. People new to this technology will be fairly confused. On that note, people new to Windows 8 will be incredibly confused. I'm still adjusting. However, the faults of Windows 8 are not Acer's fault.The best feature of the laptop, apart from its size and weight, is the touchscreen. I wasn't sure if I would like it- it turns out I love it. It makes navigating web and app content significantly better on a laptop. It's very responsive with pinpoint sensitivity. Much like when I transitioned from a full QWERTY keyboard phone to a touchscreen smartphone, I now can't imagine going back to pre-touchscreen days.The speakers are as good as I'd expect for a laptop like this, with decent sound for being underneath. However, the mute button is not with the other volume control buttons, which just seems odd. I don't use webcams often (hardly ever), but I played with this one for the review. I was surprised at its low quality, though I'm not sure how it compares to others. One last annoyance is that the touchpad is noisy and clunky. Thankfully, you can adjust the sensitivity, which was way too high when I began using it.In summary-Pros:-Touchscreen-Size & Weight-Decent sound and video qualityCons:-Touchpad-Battery life-Lack of instructionIn a nutshell: If you're a student like me, and you refuse to buy Mac products, this is a product to consider.

Word processing, web surfing, email and Skype.  I didn't do my research and ordered a ChromeBook C7 which although fantastic on internet speed, does not run Skype.  Sure Google offers similar programs as SKYPE but none and I mean none have worked for me while overseas.  Even after working with the NINJA team to solve the issue.SO I had this little Acer Aspire V5  send out as it is Windows based, which will run Skype and I love windows to be honest.  Took three weeks to get to me as I'm overseas and when I got it I was ecstatic.  Finally I thought my problems are solved, but no.  From the initial boot up I had issue after issue.  VERY slow  to do ANYTHING.  It is painfully slow to turn on, open explorer, Skype, etc.  I cannot stand Windows 8 at all, not user friendly at all.  The touch screen is absolute nonsense and I would never purchase this computer again.It is beyond slow for absolutely everything I try and do.  It often crashes while I try to open Skype, internet and quite a bit of the time the screen flickers on and off.  Booting it up needs to be done a couple times just to actually get it to fully fire up.Overall I have to say I'm very disappointed with everything about this computer except the size and appearance.

After experiencing the performance (and size limitations) of my husband's Acer netbook, I had some reservations going in.  The screen and keyboard were much smaller than what I was used to; it doesn't even have a numeric keypad (I can't even tell you why that's important to me - it's not like I use it that much at home!). It also doesn't have a CD drive. I was a little put off by the thought that it would be slow or buggy.  But really, it's not like I play a lot of graphics heavy games (Farmville does NOT count), stream a lot of movies/video, nor run a lot of complicated programs. I rarely listen to music on the PC since I bought an iPhone, and 90% of the software I have on disc is out of date anyway (why am I keeping these discs?).  I basically use my home laptop for surfing the Net and writing papers (with maybe the occasional bit of day job work thrown in for good measure).So after realizing those things, this little guy started sounding better and better.  It's a touchscreen!  It's Windows 8! It has a six gig hard drive! It's light and small and adorable!The main thing I noticed (and loved) right out of the box was how sturdy it is.  My last laptop was made of a thinner plastic and was kind of flimsy.  Not only could my cat not nap on the closed laptop without causing serious damage to the screen, the \"h\" key popped partway off after maybe a month.  Of course, cats probably shouldn't nap on laptops, but I believe this little Aspire could handle it if one of them decided to.  Also, the (backlit!) keyboard looks to be made of stronger stuff. If there's any size difference at all, I can't tell it.  I do notice the lack of a numeric keyboard, but most people wouldn't.Windows 8 takes some getting used to.  This is in no way a reflection on the machine itself - it can't help the OS that was installed on it. But it does seem that most of things I don't care for are associated with Windows 8.  I'm used to the \"Desktop\" being the first thing I see when I log on to my computer.  With Windows 8, the Start Screen - which replaced the Start Menu we're all used to using - pops up first instead, and you can access your Desktop from that.  It's not intuitive in the least (at least for me).  It took me two days to figure out how to turn the power off without cheating and resorting to ctrl + alt + delete!I don't understand the need for \"apps\" on my laptop. Maybe I'm missing the point, but I understood apps to be lighter versions of software for use on smartphones and tablets - I expect my computer to be able to run full \"applications\" or \"programs,\" first of all.  And second, I use my laptop in an entirely different way than I use my smartphone or tablet.  It just seems completely unnecessary to have a Netflix app on my start menu when I can stream video from the Netflix site easily from my web browser and enjoy full access to search features and the ability to edit my queues. I uninstalled and unpinned a lot of these silly things, because all they were doing was cluttering up my Start Screen.I did keep the mail app for a few weeks, because it looked cool.  That's about all it had going for it, actually.  I wasn't able to add all of my accounts to it (though my gmail and Outlook accounts were effortless).  But my main issue was how it handled attachments - it didn't.  So back to Office Outlook I went. Unfortunately, if you delete the Mail app, you also delete the Messenger and Contacts apps...Contacts I don't need, but I would like to try the Messenger app at some point.I didn't like that Windows 8 prompted me to create a Microsoft Account during set up.  It then used this ID and password to log me into the machine.  I was able to go in and change this later, of course, but it still doesn't sit well with me that I wasn't given the option during set up.The laptop came with a free trial of the new Office 360.  I don't agree with how they've handled the licensing for this product, so I installed my good old Office 2010 instead,  with no problems.Is it less powerful than my old computer?  I honestly don't see any difference. If it's any slower, or if there have been any lags, they haven't been enough to grab my attention so far. As for battery life, I get about the same amount of time as with my last HP laptop.  The cord is much smaller, thinner, and lighter, too, which is good when you have a cord-loving rabbit in the house.The only real problem I have experienced is with Chrome.  Chrome is my default browser for a number of reasons, the least of which being the ability to sync between devices.  That's not something I'm willing to give up.  However, I've noticed that half the time it doesn't start up properly.  And because of the way it runs in Windows 8 (it takes up the entire screen; there is no \"red x\" to close out of it, and your task tray does not appear at all) closing it out isn't quick and simple anymore.  You also can't resize the screen and have Chrome run side-by-side with other programs (a trick I was bad to employ with data entry tasks).  I can't say if this is a problem with the computer or with Windows 8.  I have had at least one person tell me that Chrome is the only browser he can get to run in 8 with any stability...and another to tell me she couldn't get Chrome to work at all!The laptop is amazingly light and easy to handle.  I can see myself traveling with it without any problems, and I have always had problems lugging a laptop in the past.  I've never really been the kind of person who sat the laptop on my lap, actually, but I find myself doing so with this machine.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cannot upgrade to windows 8.1", "Author": "Mark in Boulder", "ReviewID": "R8FVZTXXU8R56", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The ACER support system is terrible.Laptop freezes up often.Seems slow.Feels heavy for its size.Battery life is lower than specs.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "CD/DVD-ROM", "Author": "Yousuf \"Jonny\"", "ReviewID": "R1IQ95910T51OG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, I love the product.I want to buy for my MBA.

Sadly, style cannot cover over every blemish, and some of the laptops faults are issues one would need to really think out.For me, the biggest drawback to the computer is the battery usage.  The charge does NOT last very long.  Even when the computer is not in usage, the battery drains rather quickly.  In fact, after a full charge I put the computer up and got busy and didn't get to touch it for a few days.  When I turned it on it was completely dead and I had to recharge it again.  When using the computer it drains even faster, obviously.  Another issue I had here was the loading time.  The computer is very slow.  In this fast paced society, that is an issue and one that anyone using this for business may want to factor in.  I personally got this to use for work, but thankfully my job doesn't force me to be so quick all the time, thus the annoying wait time not being a giant issue for me.  I can live with it, even if I don't want to.That being said, the computer itself is pretty easy to use once you get the hang of it.

The processor just is clocked too slow at 1 ghz and maybe turbos up just a tad over but believe me, the APU is a major bottleneck for performance and you can't fix that.  SSD may help a bit but its not worth the price to upgrade to SSD with little gain in performance.  It shortly had a display failure and I sent it to ACER for replacement.  Note, ACER makes the customer pay for shipping.  Even if you pay 1700 dollars for their S7 and it DOA brand new, you pay for shipping.  After I got it back, the display worked, but the extended battery I bought will not charge now.  So obviously, they damaged the main board when replacing my display.  But they would not fix it.  They said call Acer and get new battery.  Acer accessories says they don't have the battery anymore and don't know if and when they will get them.  Even though I know the battery is still good.  I just needed another battery to prove to repair center that its not the battery but the device itself that won't charge the battery.  Anyway, don't listen to other reviews saying the A6 is good enough.  This machine is slow, I mean really slow.  Save yourself a ton of grief and pay a little more and get something with an Intel ulv or mobile processor.  This is one of AMD's worse APU's.
