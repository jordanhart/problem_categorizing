It's hard to find a strong laptop like this with over 400 bulks. Design is very good, smoothy.. Keyboard is very soft and easy to type. Touchpad is okay. There is no doubt with this system, but I wish the storage is larger (1TB is better for my demand).

I have not personally seen or played with this laptop but so far its the greatest laptop she has ever owned according to my sis. I got it while it was on sale, $467.72 tax included and it was the cheapest touch screen with I-3 cpu i could find anywhere. She will be mainly using it for college,web browsing, streaming movies. She would recommend this laptop!!!", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "In Heaven!", "Author": "L.

Never really used windows 8 or a laptop with a touchscreen before as my last one was windows 7, so after checking them out and being happy with my last mid priced machine, also a Toshiba, this one looked about right. It works great, windows 8.1 was about an hour of learning curve and I am also happy I paid a little extra for the touchscreen version. Swiping, dragging and selecting have never been easier. Its fast, quiet and well put together. Battery life is also good. Windows 8 was a breeze to get up and running despite all the bad press. I guess its because people do not give themselves time to figure it out, it is a massive difference from any previous windows. I personally applaud Microsoft for making an OS for modern machines that is fast, slick, less resource hungry, stable and secure.Does all I expected of it and more. Money well spent for me.Update. Still working great 6 months later, but internet explorer 11 which comes installed on this machine is a very hit and miss affair. Would just hang up web pages and stop altogether on a regular basis. Installed google chrome as my default browser, now harmony is restored.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love the computer - Windows 8 on the other hand...", "Author": "James Kennedy", "ReviewID": "R26A6PLG5WAZ1Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I needed a fairly inexpensive computer as I'm back in graduate school.

We dropped it and cracked the touch screen digitizer.  Which is part of life.  Purchased the replacement for $200 from toshiba parts.  Outrageous!  This screen is so thin it cannot be installed without cracking it.  I was very cautious!  The screen replacement is a fairly simple process but with the lacking quality of the screen I don't see how it is possible to replace without damaging new screen.  We will not purchase another touch screen.  Too bad as it is a great feature but the quality must be improved to make it a usable product.  Dropping it I expected it to crack I was not shocked by that.  I didn't expect the touch screen to withstand what other laptops can.  But not being able to replace it is absurd.  The quality needs work I'm disappointed.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F9VPIXO"}}
