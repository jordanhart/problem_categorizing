{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overall: very nice", "Author": "Jacob Haley", "ReviewID": "R2YV5XFXHWN6O0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a 14\" because 13 was too small and 15 was too big.  This laptop fits nicely right in the middle.  The screen is bright and clear.  The keyboard is back lit, easy to see and has nice tactile feel.  Surrounding the keyboard is a non-slip rubber type surface that is comfortable to rest your palms on.  The large touch pad in the middle is adequate, although I prefer a mouse.  Battery life is enough for me, more than enough for an evening's work.  Out of the box the amount of installed software is minimal.  I uninstalled a few things and the system seems to run clean enough.  The outside aluminum skin looks and feels nice.  The bottom is well insulated and my legs do not get hot even after hours of use.My only complaint is the weight.  If you really want something light this might not be the one you want.  I really don't travel with it so the weight is good enough, just not feather light like some of the other ones I looked at.", "Date": "July 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just finished the setup....", "Author": "David Peet", "ReviewID": "R1NN2PW14SWUQP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far I am impressed.  The speed of the SSD (vs. spinning disks) is incredible.  Lots of comments regarding the weight are published in comments around the web but, for what is packed inside, I don't know how to make it much lighter.  The \"contents\" are worth the heft to me personally.  If you looking for a solid looking and solid feeling travel companion, I would give this configuration a hard look.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "3rd Generation Intel Core i7-3537U Processor (4M Cache, up to 3.1 GHz)\n8 GB DDR3 RAM\n512 GB Solid-State Drive\n14.0-Inch Screen\nWindows 8", "Name": "Dell XPS 14 XPS14-2045sLV 14-Inch Ultrabook (Silver Anodized Aluminum)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dO-9QIdDL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00ANG3T2C"}}
