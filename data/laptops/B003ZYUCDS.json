Phone tech support goes straight to voice mail no matter what option you pick and it comes with a quick start guide and no manual so trying to fix issues is like walking around a unfamiliar room with the lights out. I suggest two alternatives to buying this you can find a decent used laptop about 4 years old for around 100 dollars that will be able to run windows xp and have 5x the specs of this \"netbook\" or another thing if you have 100 dollars to use for entertainment google origami and you will find lots of fun ways to fold the 100 dollar bill into neat shapes this will make your money last longer and save you a few headaches.", "Date": "February 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Save your money!", "Author": "Caroline D. Robert \"bookworm\"", "ReviewID": "R2XAI4XU1DSVB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This little netbook was a huge disappointment.  Which is sad to say when I expected so little.  Just wanted something for my daughter to access her Facebook and play youtube videos on primarily, which is well within the realm of what this was advertised to do.Well it has a little youtube icon but it did not even have the capability to play all you tube videos so it has been sitting unused for six months.  Today I decided I may give it to my nine year old.  It was unresponsive after it loaded up so I restarted it and it came up with the screen saying loading OS image and never loaded.  So I did a web search and there are tons of people with this same problem.  You have to reload the operating system but since it has no drive to load it from and you can't do it from the USB you have to purchase a large enough SD card, download it on your laptop, transfer it to the SD card and then load the new OS onto the netbook.Major pain for something which was probably used six hours.  And it looks like there are a lot of people doing it.  I am sure there are more reliable netbooks out there.", "Date": "August 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Save your money...", "Author": "h3ll0ash13", "ReviewID": "R1PR856Z6GLJTK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My son received this as a Christmas present from his grandparents. At first glance, it seems like a neat little netbook. It's more like a cell phone than a netbook. It runs Win CE, and it's faster than expected. You can't use flash on it though, which is a major downfall for a kid (most kid's websites are flash-based).My son was ecstatic upon opening. He couldn't wait to try it out. It connected quickly to our wi-fi with no problems. The wall charger is VERY short though, so he didn't want to sit next to the wall to play. It took almost all night to charge it! He wanted to use it the next morning - it was fully charged and lasted about 25-30 minutes. We updated the software on it (via the company's website) in hopes to help with the battery issue. It actually made it worse! The computer fails to keep time after the battery dies, and it would erase the settings we had in it (some trivial things, like my son's wallpaper and name, some more important things like the wi-fi network information).He used it maybe 5 or 6 times since Christmas. He asked to use it a couple of days ago, I plugged it in and it wouldn't charge. I left in plugged up for about an hour and still nothing. My husband inspected everything - nothing seemed to be wrong. I found my receipt and returned it to the store. I was ready for a fight, but the manager stated that 90% of the netbooks sold were returned for the same reason.In conclusion, this is actually a neat idea, but this netbook fell WAY short of expectations.

G mail was the same but could not open any messages. All web pages opened slow as molasses, thought I was back on a dial up connection.
