{"Reviews": [{"Title": "ok, but design issues create larger footprint", "Author": "parvulus quarens deus", "ReviewID": "RGEI6GB0F7JV8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for a couple of years now - good product overall but some serious design issues that need to be changed. Here's my list of pros/cons:PROS:* fast, great graphics, low glare screen* love the number pad - so much more convenient than typing across the top* overall good, steady, reliable performance.CONS: I have a quite a few cons here, which I'll describe below.* weight - this thing is a brick - at least 7-8 lbs with cord and other accessories* USB ports inconveniently placed - bottom right, near where the mouse would be (as a right-handed mouser), so my mouse keeps bumping the wires of the accessories plugged into it. The USB ports would have been better either in the top left area (and the power cord in the back) or a mix of distribution in the back and the left, where they're out of the way)* touch pad - too big - every time the edges of my thumbs touch it when I'm typing it moves the cursor somewhere else in the document and starts typing in the wrong place. This drives me crazy - if they reduced the diameter of the touchpad by about 0.75\" I wouldn't have this problem. Of course I can see another segment of the consumer base complaining that it would be too small then.* Monitor port - again this should have been in the back of the unit - on the left right smack in the middle and I can't place anything near the laptop (like a book stand, e.g.)* built-in speakers - not the best quality, for a Sony - the sound was a little noisier (static) than I expected.Overall the poor placement of the ports end up creating a much larger footprint for the laptop than I had initially expected (at least 8\" more); that's the one design issue that ranks this a 3-star product instead of anything higher.", "Date": "November 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great buy", "Author": "digital.maverick", "ReviewID": "R2OQ5458MIVPGR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great computer... I have had no problems with it.  Webcam is a little grainy for this day and age is my only complaint.  It's well made, stylish, good video quality, good battery life, good speed, good build with a nice keyboard and numpad... four USB ports are awesome.  Very bright compared to my wife's.  Plays most games that I need, nothing fancy but plays most of em.  The onboard software is not bad (though not necessary) but it's not so bogged down with it that it will annoy you.", "Date": "December 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "fast enough", "Author": "mike & cherri", "ReviewID": "R1LBWCB01YH78S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "we bought 2 of these for our kids in college and they proved to be fast enough and we get compliments and thanks from the kids when they are home from school. screens are really nice to watch movies with.", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Avoid This Retailer and its Products", "Author": "Dats", "ReviewID": "R1N2OSRSBJ9A37", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "1. This retailer is one of those web guys which always made you worried about buying things from the net.2. He will sell you a \"rebufrished\" product as brand new and then will not take any responsibility.3. I had this Laptop written pre-owned all over it but I was too naive to understand it. Sorry !! buddy your bad luck--is all the website said.4.
