Neither computer gets past the Toshiba screen and none of the online assistance is of any help.  I called the IT hotline (because their online help center is confusing and you never get anywhere with it) only to be told that in order for them to check my computer it would cost me a small fee of $149!  Upon further research it appears that my the computer does not recognize the hard drive and needs to be replaced.  Don't trust Toshiba, they are crap, even the quality of the material that makes up the laptop has decreased between my old one and new one.Also, the computer almost never left the house, and the most strenuous activity it was put through was a few hours of Netflix.Don't waste the money!  Trust me I will never waste my money on a Toshiba again.", "Date": "January 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Toshib c75d a7213", "Author": "James C.
