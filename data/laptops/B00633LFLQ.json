Did every thing I expected. A few functional improvements could be implemented. I would prefer the touch pad be centered on the case rather than centered over the typing keyboard. Positioned to the left as it is, there is not a comfortable place to rest my left wrist while using the touchpad or typing. Also, it would be a great improvement if the touch pad scrolling feature could be turned off. While using programs such as excel, I often accidentily hit the scroll feature and the file screen jumps. Other wise a very reliable unit", "Date": "September 6, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel\u00ae CoreTM i3-2310M processor\n64MB-1696MB dynamically allocated shared graphics memory\n4GB DDR3 1333MHz memory\n640GB HDD (5400rpm)\nDVD-SuperMulti drive (+/-R double layer)", "Name": "Toshiba Satellite L755-S5280 Laptop, Intel Core i3 4GB / 640HD / Webcam", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/519YaNpVd-L._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00633LFLQ"}}
