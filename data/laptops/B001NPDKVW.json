Not to mention this bronze color is really nice too.  The other 2 people who reviewed this said they are returning it because they cant see the keys? Sure, the f1-f12 keys are very difficult to see.  But return this amazing laptop because its difficult to see that a function key is labeled \"f1\" is rediculous! As long as you know how to count and have used a computer before this is the best laptop !", "Date": "March 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Specification, Poor Design Decisions", "Author": "Sean", "ReviewID": "R2W1PN61FR046L", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I read some amazing reviews of this laptop. The only one I found that had anything negative to say was S.K.'s review here on Amazon. And he's absolutely right. I also returned the laptop to HP (who offered me a $70 credit to keep it, take note). There are 3 basic design issues which, for me, make this laptop unusable.1. Keyboard. The keys themselves are a bronze color and the key symbol is black. It makes it virtually impossible to see what the keys are. An unbelievably stupid design decision. Having read S.K.'s review, I thought that maybe the keyboard is back lit, thus making it easy to see which keys are which. The keyboard isn't back lit. Even with good over head light, the keyboard is very difficult to read. I know I tried.2. Screen glare. Gone are the days, it seems, when laptops came with a readable, easy on the eye, matt finish LCD screen. This laptop, like so many I looked at, has a highly reflective plastic coating which completely covers the screen. Yes, it will protect the screen but the reflections it picks up from everything else to the sides and behind you  are incredibly distracting. If I'd wanted a mirror, I'd have bought a mirror.3. Screen tilt. The screen does not lay completely flat like other laptops I've had in the past. This one goes back to about a 120 degree angle. I sometimes use an external screen with a laptop so need something which can lay flat and not get in the way of the external screen while I use the laptop keyboard in front of it.Issues #2 and #3 I could maybe have lived with, but the keyboard issue was a deal breaker for me. A great pity because this laptop has a great spec for a great price. HP, what were you thinking?I bought a Toshiba A305-S6916 instead. It has an almost identical spec to  the DV5-1250us. It too suffers with issues #2 and #3, but it was a little cheaper. The small saving will be used up buying an anti-glare filter for the screen. Not much I can do about the tilt. Oh well.", "Date": "February 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "NO BUENO", "Author": "E. Burch", "ReviewID": "RI0OE2Q4TKP8M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I had to just give up my 17\" screen HP laptop, which over the course of three years, melted down it's own screen, had a bad hard drive and also system board issues. Now I have a DV5 which I cannot get the tracking pad to stop hopping all over my screen, going haywire. The worst tracking pad in the industry.  It makes it virtually impossible for me to write an email or a document since the system jumps around the screen and performs functions which I have not commanded, I cannot eve cut and paste or copy and paste without it taking me about 10 minutes to do so after catching the pointer.  It is unbelievable.  I have to work with this system with an exterior mouse.  Which means the level of mobility for my laptop is limited since I have to use an external mouse. Even the controls to disable the pad do not work.  Until HP gets their driver and their tracking pad under control, I would reconsider this purchase, unless you like playing hide and seek with the mouse pointer and playing \"where will I end up in at any moment on my screen?\"  I hope that they are working on it.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "A tiny flaw drags down what is otherwise an amazing computer", "Author": "S.K.", "ReviewID": "R3TH4BGQX8BDYZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a terrific computer, but has an extremely strange flaw. The keyboard is illegible. You have to strain your eyes to see the letters and characters printed in light grey on a grey background. With all the fuss made in the description about the design and form factor, it is mind blowing that can they make such a ridiculous error in design.At first I thought, no biggie... I'll get used to it. I like the graphics card with 512 megs dedicated, the 2 AMD Turion 64 bit processors, the 4 gig RAM, the 400 meg drive. Unfortunatley I have now come to the realization that this is a deal breaker for me and will return the product.

Started to have a screen flickering issue. Apparently there is a wire/cable that runs across the laptop where the screen is mounted. I thought maybe it was the LCD, screen inverter or maybe the backlight, well it's not - After opening and closing so many times the cable deteriorates and the flickering begins. People are telling me that you need to replace the entire screen to get the cable. Had some driver issues early on that caused the PC to run extremely hot, after finding the solution to that, the laptop appears to be performing well. However, this is the second HP laptop that has given me screen issues. I have a dv6000 which also has screen issues. I think it's time for me to go back to toshiba or dell. It's like going back to the bully and asking him to beat me up again.", "Date": "March 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Love This Laptop!", "Author": "MStephens01 \"MStephens01\"", "ReviewID": "R2G15DGPL93KMU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used this laptop for almost a year now and it is the best one I have ever used.I have had no problems with it.I have found the keys to be a bit hard to see but as one person said  if you know how to type it should be no problem, also I purchased a laptop holder and this works perfect and holds it at the correct angle.I highly recommend this computer to anyone needing a good affordable computer.", "Date": "February 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Value", "Author": "Naji Anaizi \"Naji\"", "ReviewID": "R1AKB02QK1J4YS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this laptop for about 5 months and so far I'm very happy.  Now some of the reviews contained, in my opinion, some silly complaints.  The screen is reflective which is great unless you use the monitor outdoors or in a brightly lit area.  The advantage of a reflective screen is that images are more vibrant and brighter at the expense of glare.  All of Apple's laptops are the same way.  In fact most consumers, as do I, prefer a non-matt finish.  One reviewer complained that the screen doesn't open all the way to 180 degrees. No laptop that I know of does. That person should just attach an external keyboard if he wants to use the laptop with an external monitor.  Finally people have complained that the keys are not legible due to the bronze color finish.  If you're using this laptop in low light conditions and you're not a touch typist then this could be a deal breaker.  Bestbuy carries the 14.1 inch version of this laptop with the same color.  Go visit the store and decide for yourself if this is a problem.

Tried working with HP to get a new keyboard at no charge to me, which they make several versions of (its more cost effective to have interchangeable keyboards, folks), and they refused. Had my computer tied up for 2 weeks to find this out. I too feel this is an asinine color combination to use in a home with lamps and overhead lights!
