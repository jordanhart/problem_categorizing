{"Reviews": [{"Title": "HP Envy 4-1043CL Spectacular", "Author": "Joe Business user", "ReviewID": "ROZ0DXF1FFZVT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Dell M1330 of five years, and 3 hard drives later finally gave up the ghost. It was, in general, a solid performer. I recently acquired the HP Envy 4-1043CL. For the money, it is nothing short of spectacular. Rich with features like the lightning fast i5 processor, 500GB hard drive, 32GB SSD, all make this a pretty seamless package.As for reviewers complaining about the monitor, it reminds me of the guys that review cars that do not understand why a car goes up on two wheels in a 130mph turn - Get over it - for 99% of the users, this screen is an upgrade over almost anything you might be replacing, and by the way, it too is spectacular. I considered a MacBook Air, with a great screen, great cosmetics, all of the Apple quirks, but at almost a third of the price, it is really hard to not like the package HP has put together - Oh, and did I mention that it is light? (3.88 lbs.)Windows 8 is a bit of a learning curve, but getting used to it is easy.", "Date": "February 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "A four star computer with a one star screen and two star trackpad", "Author": "Wes \"Wes\"", "ReviewID": "RJKJ8HLUDEOLN", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this machine.But the screen was a dealbreaker for me. I had read that the screen was mediocre, and figured that that was fine with me -- a high end screen wasn't that important to me. But \"mediocre\" doesn't really begin to describe the problem with the screen. It's washed out to the point of distraction and eye strain. Colors look odd, blacks aren't black, and whites are covered in a bluish haze. I tried color calibration and even a combination of settings found in these comments -- but they don't really solve the problem. This is, as some reviewers point out, a viewing angle problem; the screen rises to the level of mediocre -- barely passable -- when you look at it from just the right, very narrow angle. But that angle is so narrow that it's impossible to maintain, because the slightest movement will put you out of it. So again, while I wouldn't put a high end screen high up on my list of priorities, this screen I find to be so bad that I can't ignore it.Then there's the trackpad. It's not very responsive. Scrolling is terrible. This is something you can might learn to tolerate. If it weren't for the screen, I'd probably have thought seriously about just living with it.Because otherwise, it's a very fast and very nice looking computer. It's a little heavy, but that's a worthwhile trade off for the price (you can find these refurbished with 6gb of ram for $599). But before you buy one, I recommend walking into a computer store and testing one and thinking long and hard about whether you can live with the display and trackpad. These are items that the average reviews make sound like minor irritations and drawbacks. And that may be true for some. But for many others, they'll make the machine unusable.", "Date": "December 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Inna", "ReviewID": "R3FUBR2ME334JA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The only thing I don't like about this netbook is the track pad. It's just awkward to work with and not very well designed. However, it's not a deal breaker because the machine itself is so awesome! I love it and use it every day. It boots quickly, I can work on several Office 2013 programs at once: Word, Power Point and Excel mostly, listen to music and have quite a few browser windows open at the same time without a glitch. It has plenty of space for everything I need and more. Best part of the whole thing is that it came with Windows 7!", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Mousepad konks out occasionally", "Author": "K.

It packs powerful 3rd gen i5 with 6 gigs of DDR3 1600. Its specs are awesome even for today's laptops since many still use 1333 DDR3. Although it comes with 32 gigs of msata for caching and faster HDD performance, I still swapped HDD to Samsung 840 SSD and performance screams.
