He really likes the machine in particular for gaming of course.He just returned home for mid-term break and told me it has been making a ticking noise for a few weeks now. It sounds to me like the fan(s). If you lift the machine slightly and tip to one side you can sometimes get it to stop but eventually it will start again. This is not normal fan whirring noise it is a fast tick-tick-tick......Unfortunately we shipped this onward from NY to Bermuda where we live so returning it is a pain and expensive (IBC courier to NY). Also the complications of duty already paid - approx.$500. Just wondering if anyone else has encountered this problem before taking it further.It's more of an annoyance than anything else but still for a $2000 machine you don't expect this sort of thing.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best laptop ive ever bought", "Author": "matt whelan", "ReviewID": "R1CD09PO412FWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, usually im not a laptop person. had an old alienware m11x, it was nice but too hot and the battery was about 45 mins when gaming. now coming from custom built desktops im used to extreme amounts of power. now i have a friend who paid $1500 for a mac book pro, its a very nice laptop i must say, but part for part this destroys that. the macs have an i5 with no gpu, mostly ment for processing heavy applications. on the other hand the blade has an i7 4702hq processor, 4 physical cores, 8 virtual cores. it also has a gtx 765m gpu, which surprisingly is able to handle far cry on ultra. that being said bought the razer sabretooth controller i believe, that turned this laptop into a mobile xbox one/ ps4, and their not even out yet. this laptop also has 8 gigs of ram and ids far superior to the 360 and ps3. it also comes with a ssd and after counting i figured a full boot up is about 7 seconds. Alot of people complain about the screen, but its not that bad, 1600x900 is pretty close to full hd, and the matte finish allows you to use it in direct sunlight at about 50% brightness. Now that i laid out all the goods,here comes the great. The size, and battery. First off, this laptop is actually a bit thinner that the macbook pro, while packing faster hardware and a better battery. Now the battery is the best i have had in any laptop ive owned. i got about 4-5 hours of GAMING on one charge. that being said about 8 hours or so of normal use if i putit into powersaving. Overall this is the best laptop i could find and would definately buy it again", "Date": "October 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "Michael H. Reitzel", "ReviewID": "R3E3SXUA7XOOXB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this laptop. It is powerful, light and meets most expectations. The only thing missing are some keyboard keys such as page up/down, print screen, etc which can be inconvenient and limit its use in some games. But the overall design makes up for that limitation.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Fantastic little laptop for gaming", "Author": "C. Pierce \"SciFi Junkie\"", "ReviewID": "R14P6ANS95KK6A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift for my wife, who needed something smaller than a hulking giant from Alienware that she had been using.The first unit that arrived: DOA.  The graphics hardware caused \"sparkles\" whenever anything moved on screen.  Returned that, and Amazon shipped the replacement immediately.The second unit was perfect.On battery and gaming, the unit gets a little warm and the battery will last about an hour with heavy gaming.  With just websurfing or light work, considerably longer and cooler.  It's completely silent.Windows 8 sucks -- there's no redemption for that.  However, one nice bonus about this laptop is that it comes with *no* crapware.  Vendors, listen up: a clean system is a fast and reliable system.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Rulob", "ReviewID": "R1BE26V72W7673", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ONLY thing missing in this laptop is a way to easily disable the touchpad, which isnt bad but its no gamer would use it.It gets hot, but it disipates really fast so there is nothing to worry about. Can play bf4 and gets freaking hot, but 10 secs after done playing, its already cool.", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Don't Count it out Just Yet", "Author": "Nathan", "ReviewID": "R3V4OT69BHFA42", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just because it's a year old doesn't mean its not insanely powerful. Nearly every review I read online about this laptop faulted the screen, but I see no problems. It's bright and it's a screen. I moved from a 17 inch laptop with the same resolution and find this perfect. Text is readable, and all that extra space is filled with content. I like how portable this laptop is and was one requirement I had for a laptop. This laptop is a perfect candidate for amazon's 14 inch laptop sleeve which provides piece of mind and fingerprint protection, which is one I guess downside to having the best looking laptop around. Don't get me wrong I love the look of this rig, but your grandparents will treat you like you're 3 again. I guess it's the glowing green snake. I just want to say before going on however that I didn't buy this laptop because It rocks games. Here's my list of incentives: battery life 30%, Portability 20%, Power under the hood 25%, Gaming potential 15%, Looks 5%, last 5% comes down to other things such how put together and reliable the system is. I try to not make the same assumptions as many online review sites do and I wouldn't have bought this laptop If I did.Now this laptop is now nearly a year old and technology changes rapidly. This is actually why I think it's such a good deal right now. The processor is extremely powerful and the mSATA drive is the new standard for speed. These things aren't going to change in the next couple of years so drastically that this computer won't stack up. 8GB of ram sounds so little compared to other gaming laptops (read bricks) but the only time I use it all is when I'm doing a virus scan. Webcam is ehh. I opened the app on accident and it was grainy but I have an Iphone if i want to see you.A few other things people will mention about why this laptop isn't worth it is that the new one is so much better, but the new one has even greater heating issues (not necessarily bad, but noticeable in this one and I wouldn't want it much hotter), and the new screen as beautiful as it looks, can't be fully utilized while gaming and maintaining frame rates. Battery life suffers too. If a touch screen is your thing then go for it. Windows is now much nicer with touch, and I am starting to understand now all the windows 8 hate. Available ports is often mentioned as lacking too, but think about it. When is the last time you used a DVD? Or plugged into ethernet? A VGA projector plug further adds bulk without function. I'm glad to have a smaller laptop without these unnecessary plugs. You can get an external DVD drive for ~30$ or an ethernet plug for ~10$. The laptop sleeve you're going to buy will fit it.Just buy this laptop. If you've come far enough to actually read this review and actually consider this laptop then you're ready to actually experience what the Razer 14 has to offer. From the games I've played, both Civ 5 and Skyrim play on maxed out settings amazingly well, with the fan only kicking up to levels you can hear when fighting alot, just turn up the sound, it runs very quite.I think windows 8.1 is this computers biggest fault, but I'll get used to it. I've just basically turned off Start and it's mostly exactly like windows 7.I bought this from amazon's warehouse deals. The 1,000 price difference over this years model made my decision easy. Anything you buy from amazon warehouse has been inspected and it's condition listed. Mine simply didn't come in the original box, but everything was present. Probably just an open box and it saved be $$$, it's definitely worth looking into.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good home and mobile PC", "Author": "AkihiroMatsuo", "ReviewID": "RRQ4IEV184ATY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "tought battery. best slim.high power.good typing keyboard. but a littile heavy weight.I think good choice for Club Event DJ .", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelent Notebook!", "Author": "Felipe R.", "ReviewID": "R26HAKDNGY8TR6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The notebook is excelente, but the screen could be better, I mean I got a Dell Nstudio 1458 with HD resolution and it is better than this screen.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop", "Author": "Peeravuth Roeksasut", "ReviewID": "R12VXXD7YN8GYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Falling in love with designs and performance.Amazing for how thin it is.What did they seen in their dream to create this masterpiece.The heat is annoys a little.The battery lift is not that good.I will see the next model for improvement.Overall : Light weight and high performance loving it", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer, Poor customer support", "Author": "Stan Weiner", "ReviewID": "R1N3YRR7TTNFE9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great computer.
