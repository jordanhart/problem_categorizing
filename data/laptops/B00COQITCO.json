I don't have any of the space bar problems that other reviewers were complaining about.  Here are the pros and the cons:Pros:-Price is fantastic-Screen is very bright and it makes everything look really good-Great laptop for browsing the web and basic document editing-Keyboard is extremely spacious and helps me with my accuracy-Roomy display at 15.6 inches-I currently own 5 laptops and this is the only one I can put on my lap for hours at a time because it never runs hot.  That's because it has a low power processor and Asus has a good cooling system.Cons:-Web cam is low quality because of low megapixels but I rarely use it-I don't think the RAM memory is expandable but I'm still researching thisI would buy this computer again.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bad spacebar", "Author": "Lily", "ReviewID": "R1GOWVLOHLGNGK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Really tried to love this laptop...and I honestly did for the first hour. It was beautiful, light, and sleek. Then, an hour in, I decided to start using the browser to search for something and lo and behold, allmywordstypedoutasthus...basically, I found out that if I wanted a space between my words, I had to press right into the middle of the spacebar. I had to press 3/4 of an inch to 1 inch from either end in before the spacebar finally registered and a space appears. I'm a pretty fast typer...on slow days, I probably type around 75wpm, other times it'd be around 100wpm. By simply having this malfunctioning spacebar, however, my typing speed goes down to around 40wpm...which is really quite annoying because I basically can't type as freely or comfortably as I'd like. If you're already a slow typer, or don't think you'll use the spacebar much for chatting/writing essays/etc. then you should probably be fine. I really loved this laptop before finding out this. But unfortunately, a spacebar that doesn't register when you press slightly off from the middle does not mesh well with me...or back to the store it'll go...what a pity. Also, from what I've seen online, it's not that I got a lemon or whatever...apparently all laptops from asus has this problem...so be careful if you want to order from Asus...Another thing that sort of annoyed me, but wasn't really a huge deal, is that the plug is connected to the adapter box thingy...which is odd because when you plug in your laptop, if your outlet has any other available ones, your laptop plug may end up having to cover it. Also, the charger wire is relatively short. Overall, the keyboard is also pretty thin and you could sort of see the keyboard surface shake each time you type...didn't matter a huge deal for me though.The laptop does run pretty quietly...or at least it did for the 3-5 hours I played on it before I decided that I just can't 'suck it up' for 3 years using a bad spacebar.", "Date": "August 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great budget Notebook", "Author": "H. Park", "ReviewID": "RZJJ1NYA5OY4C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Getting past the issue that this is a Windows 8 os without a touchscreen, no DVD drive and the fact that you're not buying a MacBook air....this is a great notebook for general web surfing. The 2second instant on is a great feature and long standby times.  I hate Win 8 but will deal with it....it you want a high end notebook for work, etc...this is not your pc...but for the 80% of us that surf, listen to music...this machine is fine....the space bar is a bit of an issue but a conscious tap will give you the proper input.Overall, great for intended needs.  Can't complain...only issue in my eyes is the os...(for me)", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly nice", "Author": "Richard G. Durham \"Survival Advisor\"", "ReviewID": "R1LMWBP5X2C408", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wasn't expecting much after reading other reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised.  First, the reason for 4 stars is Windows 8.  I would have much preferred to have Win7.  Other than that, this is more PC than you could expect for the price.  I still don't know how it will hold up, but the performance is excellent.  The unit I got has no spacebar problem, and I really like the \"Smart Gesture\" on the touch pad.  WiFi sensitivity is excellent.  I was using an HP 110 netbook, and the larger size and larger keyboard takes getting used to.  Be prepared to spend a day to get the Win 8 updates installed.  Frustrating, but needed.  Overall, other than learning a new OS, I have only the highest compliments for this PC.  Great buy.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "A Steal!", "Author": "Thesby Tolbert", "ReviewID": "R21UNOWJL2IGIE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop works very well for its price. What makes the notebook effective is the weight and screen size. What's differently about this computer from my old Gateway is no CD Rom that's why is priced lower. There is no webcam neither. Who cares about a webcam and CD. To put it in words if you just like browsing, looking up/sending e-mails, paying bills and buying things online this is the right laptop for you. The speed of this computer is very fast but using the keys are a very smooth easy transition from an older laptop because they punch more quicker. The Gateway I owned had Windows Vista which was more slower than Windows 8 which this laptop has. I wanted a new notebook because my old laptop would not take Windows 7 nor 8 so I choose this one. The mouse pad is very slick and large which does takes time to get use to like any updated laptop. If you don't want to spend a lot of money on a laptop and/or are on a tight budget this notebook computer is for you. If you like to webcam which you have a pay per month for and the person you chat has one or like to download using CD's which are obsolete then are more pricey laptop is for you. Now Windows 8 is very tricky because this operating system does zoom in and out a website but with a very little breaking in you'll get the hang of it. Overall, this is my best and least expensive laptop and would not trade it for any other. If you need a webcam or CD rom they can be purchased for a low price but I don't use neither one. I only downloaded 4 times from the CD player with my old laptop and there was no webcam on my old notebook which I had for 6 years before it finally gave out.", "Date": "May 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Solid Laptop", "Author": "bennyg", "ReviewID": "R2P828F1R58RM8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For the money this is a very solid laptop.

I don't understand why they'd make a nice laptop and then have a keyboard that can't be typed on.Also the power-cord is VERY POORLY designed. It doesn't fit in a lot of outlets and also falls of the ones you can plug it into.The powercord I can get past but not being able to type... Thats the reason I got a laptop instead of a tablet.

What a disappointment!  Windows 8 is a horrible OS.  Nothing intuitive about it.  I didn't expect to have to start over from square one when purchasing the next-gen MS product, like the simple transition from XL to Win 7.  I also had to buy a new mouse because my older wireless mouse wasn't compatible.  Thank you, Microsoft for being completely user-insensitive.  And my spacebar doesn't work well, either.  I am not a typist, and I thought it was my problem, but after reading the other reviews, I see it is the computer.  The black case also shows fingerprints all over the place.  I could live with the space bar, and the fingerprints, but combined with the OS it's a rotten deal, no matter the price.I have found that when I click the Desktop tab in the Windows 8 screen, the appearance changes to a Windows 7- type screen, with tabs, menus, favorites and all the Win 7 good stuff that makes navigating the Net so much easier.

I saw this machine at best buy, it was light, fit in my bag, and appeared to do the trick so I bought it. Everything was going great - until I got home and unwrapped it and found that the space bar doesn't work fresh out of the box. I then went online and did some research and it seems to be a common problem. Disappointing but not the end of the world.
