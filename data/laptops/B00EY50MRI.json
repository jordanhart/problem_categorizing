Intel i5 and 128mb of dedicated video card is powerful enough to run CAD very well.  1920x1080 resolution is necessary for my work, and few laptops have this spec. 13.3\" is probably the lower limit to run CAD with all my multiple tools and icons.  It comes with DPI set to Largest, which is kind of necessary because the screen is so small.  It has two 128mb SSD in RAID 0, which seem to help to make everything run so fast.  I love the portability, slim profile and design.If you get this, update to Windows 8.1 right away.  It comes with a very cheap Bluetooth mouse which keeps dropping constantly, so, get a nice Logitech.  Overall I love this thing and I am getting ready to get another one for my business partner.You'll need something like this Samsung Ultra Portable Slim DVD+/-RW USB External Drive, Black SE-218BB/RSBS if you want to install software, and I got the $152 SquareTrade 4-Year Computer Protection Plan ($900-1000) for peace of mind.The other reviewer who complained about the touchpad is not right in giving a 1-star review just for this.  Truth is that the touchpad is a bit sensitive, but I disable it by pressing \"fn\" + \"T\" and you're done.  One tip is that, while using the touchpad, the lower corners of the pad act as buttons AND pad at the same time, therefore, if you keep one finger on the area of the button while trying to move the cursor with the other finger, you will get a very erratic behavior. Solution: lift your button finger while moving the cursor.  I hope this helps.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding product! Excellent all the way around!", "Author": "Sofia Katchi", "ReviewID": "R1ZY5DZPD5CRT8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall:Outstanding product! A Definite Winner for Acer! To me, this is the perfect rival to the MacBook Air (essentially the same size/specs) but at $850 instead of >$1200, it's a no brainer. The only objective flaw is the battery life runs 4 hours.I upgraded from a MacBook Pro to this Acer Aspire S7, and I'm glad I came back to the PC world. I think Microsoft has responded extremely well to the heat and pressure Apple has been placing on it over the years. These new ultra-thin Windows 8 powered machines popping up everywhere are testament to how serious they are about getting back on top. This particular Acer just felt perfect on my fingers when I went to check it out at the Microsoft store. I fell in love with it and had to get it.Pros:Extremely light at 2.6lbs, ultra-sleek and thin, fast and effective for my purposes, and excellent resolution and touch screen.- It's got a very professional, strong, and sleek silver finish.- It comes with an ACER leather carrying case which was an unexpected added bonus for me- It's extremely thin and light, sometimes, I can't even feel it in my bag when I'm carrying it.- With its 128GB SSD harddrive I'm both satisfied with enough storage space and extremely fast boot time. I clocked it at 11 seconds from completely shut down to completely loaded.- If you have it on sleep mode, it's an instant on if you flip open the lid.- The Intel i5 processor is quick and efficient enough for my purposes:- I use Outlook, Excel, Powerpoint, chrome (with an average of 5-6 tabs), and spotify. I run these pretty much all the time at the same time and this machine has not shown any lag whatsoever. Very smooth, quick, and responsive.- Windows 8 has grown on me and I don't find myself missing the Mac OSX at all.- It comes with a complimentary wireless bluetooth mouse (also another added bonus I didn't expect)- The screen is excellent. Resolution maxes out at 1920x1080 for an extremely sharp and crisp experience. Movies/Hulu/Netflix are great- The touch screen feature is also neat. Great for using it as a pseudo-tablet when you want to. I use it mostly for some random game apps, Netflix, or for quick navigating through my start menu charms.- Alot of these ultra-thin computers from other brands can feel awkward when typing with keys placed awkwardly, but this Acer's got everything in the right place. I'm never having to retype things and constantly backspace because of accidentally hitting the wrong keys. The placement of things like delete/home/page-up/page-down is very intuitive and natural.- The trackpad (when you're not using the bluetooth wireless mouse) is excellent too! It's a single trackpad that clicks at the inferior edge for right/left click, it's able to track up to 3 fingers and can perform all kinds of quick tasks (much like the Macbook trackpad)Cons: All minor and may not apply for your needs- I've had this machine for about 4 months now and one of the only things I don't like is that the white outside screen case can get dirty with fingerprints easily but it's got a nice strong/glossy finish so once you clean it, it looks fine. I believe there's a model that comes in a silver/matte finish, which I guess I would have preferred.- Battery life has averaged 4 hours for me- with the new processors and battery designs on the market that go for about 8-12 hours, this may be an issue if you're the type of user that sits for longer than 4 hours without a charge.- Camera is not the highest resolution for video chats/picture takingIf you're looking for an upgrade, this one is hard to beat. Great specs, great size/weight, and most of all, incredible price at ~$850. You won't find this kind of quality in this size/package with these specs anywhere else. Definitely not at Apple. At least as of 3 months ago when I was looking at these head to head, the MacBook Air 13.3\" had the same size hard drive, processor, screen size, and weight, and was priced at $1200 and I couldn't justify that wasted money. I couldn't be happier with this product.Stay tuned for a video review addendum to demonstrate some of the awesome features coming soon!", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Some pluses, some big minuses", "Author": "R. Petruschka", "ReviewID": "R3SAO1SCFZKYRJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pluses:- Outer design: really nice.  Light, thin and looks great.- Screen quality - really nice HD screen.  Like it a lot. When looking at screens of other laptops (older ones, not HD) I can see clearly the difference.- Packaging - comes with a bluetooth mouse, a nice case for the computer, and Ethernet and VGA adapters.- Price - very competitive compared to other vendors.Minuses:- Track pad is almost unusable.  Just could not get along with it, and I have been extensively using laptops with track pads for about 10 years.  Good there is a nice bluetooth mouse supplied in the package, without it I would have thrown the laptop out of the window.- Battery is not that great.  I did not take time but I could feel that it does not give a very long running time, surely less than what I expected.- Keyboard - repeat key problem (sticky key).  Need to install zechofix (search it in google) to solve the issue.  I spent two frustrating weeks with the laptop until I found that fix.- Performance - so so.  Expected better performance especially with disk (flash) intensive operations.Overall I like the design, shape and weight, not not so pleased with the overall usability, I'd give it between 2 to 3 stars, decided on 3 starts because of the low price of this laptop.", "Date": "January 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not buy Acer products", "Author": "Val D.

I took a chance on this Acer and now the cooling fan is making a terrible racket.  The unit is five months old.  Called Acer and their solution is for me to backup everything, send it to them for 7-10 days and hope to get it fixed. With an obvious hardware defect they should send out a new unit and allow me to use Windows migration tools to move to that unit and not lose 7-10 days of productivity.  Also, their tech support is India and it takes to two to three times through each sentence to understand what is going on.  Terrible support and marginal product to begin with.My mistake.

I only have two complaints about it.First, the backlit keyboard is a great idea . . . when it is dark. BUT, the automatic variable light level works against itself in a softly lit situation. You see, the keys and the computer face are all aluminum color and the key symbols are cut-outs (to allow for back lighting). Makes sense ... except in the low light situation. Then the backlight comes on low, and that eliminates any contrast between the symbols and the key face so then the keys look blank! I guess that is no problem for those who have learned to touch type and never have to look at the keyboard, but that's not me.My solution? Most of the time I have to turn the backlight off. Then I can see contrast between the key faces and the cut-out symbols.My second complaint is that there are only 2 usb ports.But, it is very light weight.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great!", "Author": "Cristina Rodrigues", "ReviewID": "R2B9OW94ME5KOL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is perfect, much better than was I expected.

Large 256GB SSD--twice the storage capacity as others in the price range.2.  Very sturdy and aesthetic design--aluminum chassis and Gorilla Glass touch screen and back lends feels and looks great.3.  Fantastic  multi-touch display and tech specs (i5 with Haswell-based chipset, solid amount of RAM, backlit keyboard).4.  Very thin and light, yet strong.5. Includes Bluetooth mouse.6.  It includes Windows 8, which is much more tolerable on a touch-screen.  I'd upgrade it to 8.1 asap.In summary, this ultrabook outshines many of the other ultrabooks on the market, and is a high-quality choice with much more horsepower than competitors.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop marred by stupid superficial design flaws", "Author": "A. Block", "ReviewID": "R3AMD5M38GSCIY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This machine looks great, is super light, boots up super fast, and functions well. The touch screen is great. But boy does it have some real boners in the design department. I haven't had the trackpad problems others have mentioned, but the keyboard is just awful. If you don't hit a key absolutely square, it will either produce no letter or two or three copies of the letter. It slows me way down, typingwise, and breaks my chain of thought when I'm writing. (Coming back to add that, during writing this review, I had to backspace to add missing letters or delete extra ones 14 times. These were not normal typos -- I didn't count those -- but due to the keyboard. Oops, add two more to the count, as I got \"thhose\" and \"oopps\" just now. Make it three more, for \"ow\" instead of now. You seee how it goes. Didn't bother correcting that last one or I'd never get out of here!)The other major problem is that the on/off button is on the side of the computer. When I try to adjust the placement of the computer on my lap or desk, often times I press the button accidentally. This isn't a huge problem, so long as the button is set to put the computer to sleep. But I do have to wait several seconds for it to complete the sleep process, then turn it back on, wait a few seconds while it boots, swipe up the screen, and enter my password. So five or ten times a day, I end up having to go through this 20-second process. It's not nearly as annoying as the keyboard problem, which happens constantly, but it is a drag. What's most annoying about these glitches is that they seem so massively avoidable to me. Don't up the on/off button on the side of a laptop. Some people use laptops, you know, *on their laps*, so they need to touch the sides frequently in order to adjust their position. So you don't put buttons there. I mean ... duh! And the keyboard thing ... I don't know. There's no excuse.I'm going to keep the machine, but I wouldn't recommend it to someone else unless you can get a very, very good deal on it.Edited to add: There's one more boner I forgot to mention. The designers thought (I guess) it'd be sexy if instead of just printing the character(s) on each key on the keyboard, they made character-shaped cut-outs on the keys and illuminated them from within. Sounds cool, right? The lamps go on about two seconds after you start typing, so it does function. But the lighted letters are pale aqua and the keys are silver, so unless the room is dark, you really can't distinguish the illuminated letters from the keys. This is not awful if you're a touch-typist, which I am. But I do need to look when I got for characters like & and + and | and so forth. So I end up peering and peering, trying to read the illuminated character labels. It's a needless annoyance.", "Date": "January 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horrible Mousepakd and Keyboard.

It is, specially the mousepad. I almost returned it because of it, but after a while I configured it so I could use. Pretty much had to disable everything.The rest of it is pretty good. Very light, good performance. Turns on and off very quickly. One problem is that it turns on automatically when you open the laptop. It's a little bit annoying because you need to turn it off when you are opening for different reasons.The touchscreen is much better then i imagine it .Too bad the monitor doesn't flip to be used like a tablet.

The Acer does not disappoint!The i5 processor has handled what I do with MS Office, as well as some video editing. Battery life is hard to gauge. Running the processor hard or with an external disk drive, perhaps 2-3 hours. Most activities, 4-6 hours. With the screen brightness turned down and light processor usage, 8 hours.I couldn't last the day at work with a single battery charge, so I bought an extra charger. It charges at the desk, then is ready to go for meetings and trainings.The screen is so nice - a true IPS panel for a clear display and accurate colors. This by itself jacks the price up a bit.The 256G SSD is another reason this thing is spendy. Many so called Ultrabooks use a hybrid drive - 20G of SSD with a standard 500G 5000RPM HDD. This saves money and allows a quick bootup but at the cost of battery life. You get what you pay for.The mouse pad is better than any other mouse pad I've used, but the concept is just wrong, and they are all rather difficult to use if typing. There's a quick key to turn it off when desired, and I usually so desire.The computer came with a nice case, and to my surprise, a Bluetooth mouse.All in all, an excellent unit for those of us on the cutting edge of technology.", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Work Laptop", "Author": "stephanie", "ReviewID": "R2GH57YJLGV3L1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Ok so the pros of this machine are that it is light, it is fast and it has a nice screen with a touch screen which is pretty cool.  Beyond that it drives me nuts.I think most of the issues are Windows 8 related, however there are some that are just bad design.1. THE KEYBOARD IS AWFUL!  it is so hard to type on the keys are oddly colored and kind of hard to read if you aren't in ideal lighting conditions, even with the backlight.  Honestly, I think it is worse when they are lit.  The overall feel of the keyboard is terrible and the response is pretty bad.  Sometimes i get 5 hs in a row, other times it just doesn't notice that I hit the comma key 10 times and I want a comma there.2. The touch pad!  Maybe it is because I am a Mac user, and switching between the two just throws me off, but I find it really hard to use.  plus if it is on, and you type, be prepared to start typing in all places but where you want to type.I almost wish I could leave this review written in the way that my keyboard wants it written, however I have edited all the triple t-s and missed periods.The Bluetooth mouse...a pain in the butt also, never wants to connect and the bluetooth on the machine always seems to shut off and not allow me to turn it back on.  I know this could be remedied by a re-start of the computer, but I don't want to close all my documents and projects out 10 times a day.
