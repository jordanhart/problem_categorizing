As anyone would I agreed and let me say that it was the worst mistake I ever made.  This laptop not only has an infra red receiver built in (it can be turned on and off through a remote even) but it was the most stable and dependable computer I ever owned.  This computer is also beautiful in design and amazingly powerful for its age.  My new alienware I have had nothing but problems with and is nowhere near as attractively designed.  I am now looking to but this computer again just to dedicate to media as a media hub.", "Date": "March 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "great speed with a major flaw!", "Author": "Michael Jude Kelsey \"Denegra\"", "ReviewID": "RIHTBLE28WY8T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned this laptop for about 8 months at this point.  Let me tell you that is by far the fastest laptop I have ever used.  It handles most games with ease at full graphics.That being said there is a major flaw with this laptop.  Within 2 months of owning the laptop, the keys started popping off.  Dell does have a picture tutorial on how to put this keys back on, but if you follow the tutorial it will often lead to adjacent keys popping off.  And if you push too hard when trying to get the keys to latch, then you are out of luck.  Luckily my first experience with Alienware customer service ended in a keyboard replacement in less than 2 days from calling tech support.  However when it started happening again tech support was not that helpful.  I was told I would need to purchase a replacement keyboard for $110!  The laptop is under warranty for 4 more months.  I was even considering extending the warranty.My suggestion is to use the built in keyboard as little as possible.  I use a logitech keyboard now, my biggest issue is now the laptop does not really travel easily anymore.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "complete junk", "Author": "ep", "ReviewID": "R2OUJTFRPD0A6V", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this computer is a complete waste of money total junk after 2 months the battery dont charge very slow keys fall off  the back light does not work and more", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B004O3BIBY"}}
