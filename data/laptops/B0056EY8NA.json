{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Samsung Series 9 11.6 inch (NP900x1b-US01A)", "Author": "talthing", "ReviewID": "R3LUSWDK20P2MT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had this  for about 5 days now.  I traded in the Series 3 11.6 (Princeton) for this one.Build:I can attest to the machine's toughness.  While I have yet to drop it...I haven't exactly been delicate with it either.  I was able to pry off the bottom to have a look inside.  No problem.  The screen doesn't seem to flex as others have mentioned in their review (seems pretty solid) and I do keep leaving the sliding doors to the ports open when I threw the laptop in by pack going to work (it's just a regular pack...no padded laptop pocket and I didn't have a case or anything to put the laptop into.  Doors seem to be working fine (not that I enjoy testing my luck...I just keep forgetting)Hardware:I love the keyboard and display (especially the keyboard backlighting)  Wifi seems low-end for a high-end model (same chip as in the 13.3 inch Series 9 (bcm4357).  I did a skype test of the  in low light...it seemed ok but not great (basically I had to be right up to the camera to be seen).  Speakers are pretty good (I did prefer the Samsung Series 3 which had their speakers above the keyboard instead of underneath the unit).  Speakers seem to be loud enough and stereo sound (even when placing the laptop on a chair or bed).  YMMV (I\"m not expecting the speakers to compete with bigger laptops or external speakers).  The battery life seems to be sub-par  (2 1/2 to 3 hours using continuously - not even streaming video or audio - and, yes, Ubuntu has power management settings which I've configured)Popping the bottom off to look at the hardware, there is no 204 pin memory modules so it looks like replacing/upgrading the memory is difficult/impossible (I'm not brave enough to try extracting the motherboard to see if the modules are on the other side below the keyboard).  I do love the fact that the SSD is PCI-E (and can be replaced..as opposed to soldered on the motherboard like macbook air.)  I'm going to replace the wifi card with a Centrino 6230 (as soon as it gets here)Software:I reformatted to Ubuntu Natty 64 bit and loaded VMware player for Windows 7.  I haven't had any issues with the touchpad.  All the complaints about multi-touch gestures not working or limited seem to be a Windows only issue.  Specifically two-finger scrolling and two-finger tap (for right-click) work flawlessly.  Since the touchpad works on my Win7 install via vmware tools this functionality is still present when I'm in Windows.  (win7 Pro 32 bit)...althugh I haven't played around very much on the Windows side since I use the Unity mode and just launch Outlook and IE mostly.  The Broadcom chip seemed to work for me (I'm using it until my Centrino 6230 gets here) I'm on kernel 2.6.38.11 if that helps out anyone.I can't give it 5 stars because of the wifi and battery.  All in all, I like the laptop very much.  Other than the wifi card and the battery life...this was worth the $400 over the Samsung Series 3...while Apple offers configuration options for the Macbook Air 11 inch...the price tag is $1649 (core i7, 256 gb ssd option) + $249 or so for the applecare 2 year warranty.  While I like OS X...I want to use Ubuntu as my OS (and not through vmware)If you're a windows user and want a thin and light laptop the Series 9 is the way to go.1/5/12 update - Ok, I've had my Series 9 for 4 months now.  Still love it.  Since the last review I've reformatted from Ubuntu to Win7 (Ultimate 64-bit).  I installed the Intel Centrino 6230 card and it works flawlessly.  I ended up taking the sliding port doors off.Hardware - Under Windows 7 I Installed all hardware drivers that were available from Windows update and the rest from the Samsung support site.  I do think the battery has a little better performance under win7  .  I use sleep mode (left it asleep at 50% battery life all night and most of the day).  When I woke it up...the battery was at 49%.  I used it for a bit and put it back asleep.  When I got home I got back on it.  Battery life now at 31% (using it for about 1/2 hour).  Compared to Ubuntu I'd say I'm eeking out an extra 1/2 hour or so on windows.Software - Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit (SP1) - all updates from windows installed (except the 35 language packs...don't need those).  Use the drivers from Microsoft and only install the drivers you need from Samsung.  Use the battery life extender (software section) from the Samsung site.  And the firmware update 1.0.0.2 (firmware section) on samsung site.In conclusion - You will need to replace the wifi card (I recommend the Intel Centrino 6230).  You will want to install a fresh copy of your flavor of windows (or linux) 64 bit edition and delete the existing partitions during the OS install.  Under Windows 7, when you get updates just create a new restore point...you don't need a separate recovery partition.  If you are going to create an image you will definately want to do this via network. If you're just worried about your data and settings...just use Windows Easy Transfer (enable and login as administrator).  I've got 2 external monitors running...one is on a USB display (UGA USB video adapter) and the other is through the mini HDMI port.  Run the USB video adapter on a USB hub works great.11/17/12  1 year and 3 months...Laptop still functioning like a pro.  I would recommend using the Samsung AA-AH1NAMB/US Micro HDMI To VGA Adapter.  I was using an VGA > HDMI > micro HDMI  and connectivity was extremely sensitive.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excellent portable laptop", "Author": "cemkur \"cemkur\"", "ReviewID": "R2UIN49XCHUVQI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Prior to this, I used Macbook Air (11 inch screen) and it was not up to challenge for the relatively simple computing tasks and it lacked so many ports. This Samsung on the other hand is very powerful, lightweight,functional with a slick design(given, not as slick as Macbook Air), I would strongly recommend anyone who is looking for a lightweight, powerful laptop.", "Date": "November 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best version of the 11.6 available", "Author": "David W. Roberts", "ReviewID": "R1DEQ09XXBQEJ2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The stats listed for this item are not false. This is one of the few 11.6 inch laptops that was manufactured with a 128 GB SSD drive, and 4GB of ram. I thought it was a typo, and was pleasantly surprised to see that it was exactly as was listed.The only disappointment, is that this came with the faulty wifi card that's usually associated with the Series 9. I purchased an Intel Centrino combination bluetooth and wifi card for this and replaced it right away. The wifi now works perfectly. I had a tricky time opening the laptop up due to some stubborn screws. Be very careful not to strip the tiny things or it may be permanently sealed forever.I should also mention that I'm typically someone who is very bothered when electronics are made of fingerprint prone materials. A good example would be the glass on touch screen phones. Many people say that this computer is a 'fingerprint magnet', but I actually found this to be false. While you WILL have some finger printing for every day use, it's only a 'magnet' if you're doing something like eating popcorn or a cheeseburger while using it. There is a glossy plastic frame around the screen that I would deem as a 'magnet', but you shouldn't be touching the screen with your fingers anyway.Fantastic little computer once you replace the wifi card.", "Date": "July 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Hard drive died within a week", "Author": "Charles R Vinal", "ReviewID": "R3M3CC4ECM1U3B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think there are some serious quality issues with this version of the Samsung device. The packaging I received seemed to already have been opened at one point, so I think my device may have already been returned once, fixed, and resold. Anyway, after one week of use the SSD drive failed and everything on it was lost. Yeah, should have been backing up everyday I guess, but I usually back up every week and the machine didn't even last that long.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good laptop", "Author": "Ali", "ReviewID": "R1C9X2RCHDKWMZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a heavy computer user. When I wanted to buy this laptop I saw the bad reviews about WiFi so when I ordered this laptop I ordered an external wifi adapter in case! When I received this laptop every thing was good.

Light, small, fast.  Arrived next day as scheduled.  Quite snarky.Cons:1) The recovery partition takes up 20 Gigabytes of the 128 Gigabyte hard drive.  I consider this a very poor choice by Samsung.  On a 1 Terabyte or 5000 Gig drive it doesn't really matter very much, but on a 128 gig SSD drive, that is a large percentage of the drive and substantially cripples the capacity of the computer.2) I purchased this and right away the Wi-Fi (wireless connection) was inconsistent and undependable.  It frequently would not connect even when sitting next to a new Netgear N600 router.  Every other wireless device connects to this router flawlessly.  We spent hours with knowledgeable friends and at with the Geek squad BestBuy.  They couldn't solve the problem.Today (Dec 17th) I called Netgear and spent an hour and a half on the phone with their technician.  He couldn't solve the problem.I called Samsung and spoke to Jennifer in technical support and she quickly stated that this is a known problem with some of their Network Adaptors.  They got a bad batch of these cards and they went out in computers and some work fine and some are defective.  So this is a defective one and it just needs to be replaced.  She set up a service order number and then said that it would take 7 to 10 business days after they receive it to get it back to me.  With ground shipping and the Christmas and New Year's holidays that probably means mid January.I said that this was a very poor response for a brand new, quite expensive computer that was defective from the factory.  I do not believe that Geesung Choi, Vice Chairman & CEO of Samsung wants to provide this as the customer experience for their quite expensive, flagship, little laptop computer.  She said that she could do nothing.  She apologized many times.  I requested to speak to her supervisor.I was connected to Filippe (spelling?) the supervisor, who said the same thing.  I stated that I understand that things like this can happen but since this is a quite expensive computer and was defective from the factory, they really should provide an expedited service to get me back up and running as soon as possible.  Perhaps I ship it on Monday; they receive it on Tuesday; repair it (with the known issue) and ship it back on Wednesday; I receive it on Thursday and I would feel that they had done everything possible to take care of me.  She started that she could do nothing.  I requested to speak with someone else and she said that the only group who could do anything was customer relations. Fine.  I requested to speak with them and spoke with them.I was connected with Claudatia (spelling?) who is in the Executive Customer Relations Department.  She stated that she could do nothing and she was the one who informed me that the shipping was by ground to Texas (3-4 days).  She could check on the status but nothing more.  I again said that this was a very poor response for a brand new, quite expensive computer that was defective from the factory.  I do not believe that Geesung Choi, Vice Chairman & CEO of Samsung wants to provide this as the customer experience for their quite expensive, flagship, little laptop computer.But that is what I am left with.  A new expensive computer that was defective from the factory and they will do nothing out of the ordinary to repair.3)  I had also purchased the $ 180 \"Service Express 5 days or less\" Protect it plan from Service Net.  I called them and spoke with Heather.  She stated, after being disconnected twice, that since it is under warranty then they will do nothing and referred me back to Samsung.  I asked if they were refusing to service a computer that didn't work, and she stated that she was just refusing to override what she had been taught to do, which is not to repair it if it is under the manufacturer's warranty.At this point I cannot recommend this computer if you need to use Wi-Fi to connect it.I would also not recommend the service plan if this is how they deal with a computer that doesn't work.", "Date": "December 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Awesome Notebook, Mediocre Wi-Fi", "Author": "Ray", "ReviewID": "R1Y6QOD8CT41HY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The internal wifi performance is acceptable in many situations. However, the wifi performance plummets when there are obstructions blocking the signal. The wifi on other laptops performed much better in the same challenging scenarios. I was willing to accept this flaw because the rest of the computer was perfect for me. I wanted the portability of an iPad with all the capabilities of a laptop. In addition, the mediocre internal wifi performance can be overcome with an external USB wifi adapter. As an upgrade, I got a USB adapter with 5 GHz capability; the internal wifi can only operate at 2.4 GHz.The laptop is incredibly small, thin, and light. Yet, the keyboard and clickpad are decent-sized because all of the laptop surface is utilized. The clickpad is the best touchpad that I have ever used. Dozens of options for the clickpad allow it to be configured so well that a mouse won't be missed. I don't like tapping because it frequently results in accidental clicks, and you don't need it with this clickpad. The keyboard is decent, but it doesn't feel as good as other laptops. The tops of the keys are too flat, but this is true with many laptops. The keyboard backlighting is great for poor lighting scenarios. The screen is nice, and it is matte, which is crucial for preventing glare and reflections. Battery life seems good, and I guess that it will provide at least 5-6 hours. The computer came with a lot of unnecessary software that could slow it down. Fortunately, Samsung made it easy to install Windows 7 with only a minimum of software. In the process, I re-claimed some disk space by getting rid of the factory image. At $680, I am completely satisfied with this super portable notebook. The mediocre internal wifi would be hard to accept at a full retail of $1200.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Possible Wifi Solution", "Author": "Patrick McReary", "ReviewID": "R3O3FB0ZCT5RED", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Overall impressions: Eh, it's decent. Thickness, battery, screen, heat, all leave areas for improvement (they're alright, 7-8/10). Speakers are surprisingly loud & nice, as is the SSD. Keyboard, ports, build quality are all adequate. Must use two hands to open the lid.The wifi was downright embarrassing however. Initially the laptop was seeing ~0.67-1.0Mbps download and ~0.50Mbps upload (speedtest).My solution (NP900X1B-A01US) -requires a basic familiarity with computers:0) Create a restore point.1) Use Aida (google Aida hardware) to find out what model wireless network adapter your model has. Aida // Devices / PCI devices (e.g. Broadcom BCM43225)2) If you have a Broadcom BCM43225 I will share my path to adequacy/satisfactory performance:-First tried updating drivers through windows, no change.-Second tried changing settings (power modes, wifi settings, bluetooth settings, etc.), no change.-Third looked for driver updates online. Broadcom seems to focus on selling their hardware to companies like Samsung and letting others worry about driver updates/product support. I didn't find any drivers through either company, but I did find:_Lenovo link to vers. 5.60.18.41 which took speeds from 0.67-1.0Mbps to ~3.3Mbps download ([...]_Third party link to vers. 5.100.249.2 which brought speeds up to levels comparable to the other devices on the network ~5.1Mbps ([...]  -Actual link: ([...]If you are experiencing wifi problems but have a different wireless network adapter just plug the model number into google along with \"driver\" or \"driver updates\".

I researched the product on numerous sites and it seemed perfect even though it was very expensive.  I was looking for a small, portable, lightweight laptop that was efficient, yet portable.  When the computer arrived, it seemed as though it was exactly what I wanted and expected.  However, soon it was obvious that the laptop was worthless especially for the money.  The biggest problem is that the wireless adapter is terrible.  It has a very limited range, doesn't keep a signal and is very slow if and when it does connect.  The laptop is supposed to be portable, yet it doesn't connect to the Internet.  In addition, the configuration is extremely difficult to operate.  Samsung and Microsoft have screwed up this product.  The software overrides basic functions.  I am very good with computers and own 2 other laptops.  I've been working on this laptop for 3 straight days.  Bottom line, the laptop is junk.  Don't buy it.  Its a nice concept and maybe Samsung will eventually improve the product so its functional, until then buy a netbook if you want better performance at a much lower cost, or buy a Mac Air or any other laptop for a better experience.  On top of all that, after I purchased the laptop online at Amazon, I received an email that the laptop is not refundable (this was after I placed the order, but before I received the laptop).  Are you kidding me?  $1,200 for a laptop that is junk?  The good thing is this is America, and in America consumers have rights.  If Samsung/Amazon do not give me a full refund, they will be hearing from my attorney, and based on other customer reviews I won't be alone.
