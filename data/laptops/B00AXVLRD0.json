Lenovo Ideapad U510 model has a very known hardware issue with the ELAN touchpad. I returned this model exactly for the same issue. This issue is known since Dec 2012 I believe. See the following link:http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/IdeaPad-Y-U-V-Z-and-P-series/Jumpy-and-Laggy-Touchpad-on-U510/td-p/952467You will literally find 14 pages filled with customer complaints. The discussion thread stopped when someone from Lenovo support acknowledged it as hardware issue. Lenovo is shameless that it is still selling this faulty model just to clear its inventory. Looks like they prefer their own interests over ours. They should have recalled this model and come up with a new model that fixes the touchpad issue and discontinue the U510 model altogether.I bought this Lenovo laptop to replace my old Lenevo Thinkpad bought 6 yrs ago. I thought Lenovo was a great brand but I will now shop for either HP or Dell.", "Date": "June 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "great value/spec and stylish laptop", "Author": "Scott F Ellyn", "ReviewID": "RRW2WOHA3I0NG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my U510 at another retailer (same spec and price) and must say this is a great laptop.  The screen is crisp and clear, the keyboard is a joy to type on and the speed meets my needs.  The style of the laptop (like a journal or notebook) with the same color top and bottom is very cool and gets glances when I am carrying it around or using it.Great perforemce at a great price.", "Date": "May 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrible laptop", "Author": "W. Oar \"Whit\"", "ReviewID": "R3NOD33NH7J360", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I needed a laptop because I was starting college, so after days of internet searching my dad and I settled on this laptop. Oh how I wish we hadn't.What seemed good when this was compared to other laptops: - Price (though this was only because it was on sale, as it is now it is DEFINITELY not worth the nearly $700 it's charging) - RAM (I needed at least 6GB to work well with the Adobe programs I use like Photoshop) - Decent hard drive storage - 24 GB solid state drive - i5 core was sufficient power for my needsWe were excited for the laptop, but a few months of use have revealed SO many problems.What's wrong: - Internet connection is temperamental. The laptop will say there are no networks available when 10 minutes later it will miraculously find 5. When there are networks detected it will only sometimes connect, other times when it says it's already connected it actually won't be so the page just keeps loading and loading. When it works the speed is average. - Keyboard does have a bit of flex, it was weird at first but not that big a deal. - There's no way this battery is 6 hours. - The laptop does not feel very sturdy. - The touch pad is screwed up. Big time. It'll jump from the top of a 20 page document to the bottom one moment, then make you scroll over and over just to move a few inches down the page. It will keep scrolling when you want it to stop, and has an absolute spazz attack if you have more than one finger resting on it at a time. Sometimes it doesn't respond at all. Seriously an issue.The wrong that's lifestyle changing (at least for me with my laptop experience): - This computer likes to selectively shut down. Totally randomly. Normally when you close the laptop it goes to sleep, but half the time when I open the computer after closing it, even if I closed it 5 seconds ago, the computer will have shut off instead of going to sleep. Once it's even done it to me when the computer was still open. When the computer decides to randomly shut down, all your applications and documents are closed. THIS MEANS--absolutely NEVER close this laptop without saving a document AND closing it. Even if a document is saved but still open, and the computer decides to shut off, there's a chance that the abrupt shutdown will corrupt your document. I found this out the hard way. I was currently acting as a beta for a 417 page novel and the document was saved in a format that was unrecoverable. The computer decided to randomly shut down, the document got corrupted, and I lost 117 pages of edits. I was about to throw my computer at the wall. - Basically, just don't close your computer if you're still going to have documents open or use internet pages that are open. When you finally do close your computer, bookmark the pages if you still want to use them, SAVE & EXIT out of all documents.Overall, this laptop is not worth the money, especially when it's listed for nearly $700.

Had that fixed after googleing for days on end about what the problem could be. But overall its just a very bad pc, considering the quality one expects nowdays - expecially from this brand. I really hate the keyboard---except the backlit part, which is great. The letters are too far apart, one keeps hitting the touchboard accidentally with the lower part of the hand when typing so the cursor jumps. Its just a mess. In terms of speed and size the machine is fine, but really, all of them are nowdays.

For that price, it is a steal, but for what they offer it here for, it is definitely overpriced, because there are problems with it:The touchpad is quite annoying, as it jumps when scrolling down - otherwise ok.The wifi does go off often for inexplicable reasons (on battery and everything, still unstable) - had to get the official drivers with the connection utility from Intel to be at least able to troubleshoot it efficiently.The battery lasts pretty long, some 4 hours, so that's fine.Also, for some reason, sometimes when I close the lid, it goes to sleep, sometimes it turns off (although I set it up to go to sleep only), so I don't know what the deal is with that.ALSO, there was a huge problem with the online sign-in to Windows8 with my (or any) Microsoft account initially (it was impossible, gave me an error every time) and I solved that by changing some registry (do your research and you'll find a solution), and it looks like Lenovo has a broken copy of Win8 that they are putting on these computers, otherwise the system has worked fine.Moreover, beware, the speakers are really, really quiet, it's kinda ridiculous.Oh yeah, and the last problem (I'm aware of) is the annoying beeping when the battery is low. I did all the research and no, it is not possible to turn off in the system or in bios, anywhere - you just need to mute ALL the sounds, then it goes away. That means that you are not able to play any other sounds at the same time.So yeah, there are many issues with this. I'd say the best thing about this computer is the design and a good keyboard, otherwise don't spend more money than you have to, there are other models from other brands that work much better for this price!", "Date": "August 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Expensive!!!
