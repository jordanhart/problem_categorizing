It clicks and I have to press hard to make it respond. It also does not \"drag\" very well...So, I plugged in my USB mouse and love the way that works!I mainly bought my Sony Vaio E for my graphics program / Corel Draw.I was very frustrated at first having to learn Windows 8. But after I Googled Windows 8 for Dummies and downloaded the PDF things were much smoother. Its not so bad once you learn it. Not sure I would want to use it daily ( I use my iMac daily) but the Sony is nice.I LOVE the white color on white keyboard. I LOVE the way the keyboard is backlit! Cool!The battery lasts about 5+ hrs. Which is perfect!The screen tilt is great too. Nice monitor color.My only complaint so far is the mouse pad area needs to be reinvented.I read reviews and read many before I decided on buying the Sony Vaio E.So, writing this review I hope I have helped someone make a good decision.", "Date": "June 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm happy with my product", "Author": "Pablo Acosta", "ReviewID": "RC16AJWNCBO3D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "5 stars because it is what I was looking for, fast, large capacity and good looksI would have liked to include blu ray but it is very important", "Date": "May 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Pink PC!", "Author": "Dennis", "ReviewID": "RLGM9B4P495B4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great PC and it does it all!

It was obviously jammed in there when assembled and the only way to remove it is to dismantle the laptop. That's sloppy work and I am upset that it should need repair right out of the box.Also, within two weeks of owning this laptop, it's begun issuing different errors and restarting. It's even claimed that it could not find an operating system. Every time it restarts, it appears to run normally for a while, but soon has another problem that it needs to be restarted for.The laptop is very attractive, but at this point, that's the only positive thing I can say.

Right from the start I started experiencing problems. A blue screen would appear and would have to restart the laptop, every other day. While I would be on the internet, with a few tabs open, ALL of them would refresh constantly and I would have to log back in to each. It freezes all the time, disconnects from the wifi every few minutes. It is just a horrible laptop. I contacted Sony about this issue, and they told me to do a few things, reset the BIOS, do a systems recovery, and if that didnt work, to refresh the whole PC. After I did that, I could not do anything on it. I couldnt download anything, no new web browser,(I was stuck using explorer), none of the websites worked, I couldnt personalize the laptop to my liking. It was all stuck on factory settings. I called Sony back,and they said its a normal, easy fix, and they would send a technician to replace my hard drive. If they knew this laptop has these issues, why do they sell this faulty laptop? AND Sony was very slow at contacting me back about these issues. No one called to set up an appointment to come fix it, I had to call them constantly to keep asking when someone will come, how long, and all they'd say was, \"Im sorry for this inconvinience...\" It took 2 weeks to finally get someone on the phone that told me what day they'd come. If I knew this laptop would bring me such trouble after owning it for 3 weeks, I would have never bought it. I am stuck with it now, and hopefully that hard drive that the man replaced will solve my issues, but this is a bad impression Sony gave me of their service, and products.Dont waste your money on this cute, but horrible working laptop!!!!", "Date": "June 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Crashes", "Author": "Victoria", "ReviewID": "R1RQD1TPO6EQK3", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have owned this lap top less than a month and I have decided to return it.

If you are thinking about buying this, do yourself a giant favor and don't. Save your money and buy something of better quality. Window's 8 is a gigantic disappointment, and because of how this laptop is built you can't just uninstall and reinstall 7, which was very sad. This laptop lasted 20 days before it started having daily crashes and freezes. Let me be clear, I use this for school. I bought this so I could have a realiable laptop you use for school and I can't even take my school online tests on this computer out of fear it will freeze and I will loose my date. I was extremely disappointed in this, if I could get my money back I definatly would, for a jobless student this laptop is a big mistake.

I loved my first one, model PCG-7184L (definitely a 5-star in my book). It served me well these past several years with no problems until I recently destroyed the display by dropping it.I much preferred the high-quality look and feel of the old VAIO model...and not just because of the silver finish versus the pink color of this one. Although in all fairness, I'm sort of liking the pink. Based on other reviews, I was afraid that it would look like it belonged in Barbie's Dream House. But, with its pearlized salmon pink finish, it seems considerably more of a \"beachy\" look to me.This new model's keyboard seems more cheaply made. Perhaps this lighter-weight, flimsier keyboard surround is a necessity due to the backlighting of the keys; but it just doesn't seem as sturdy and well put-together as my last one. The backlighting is a nice feature; but for daytime, I actually find the lettering on the keys to be difficult to see since they are faintly imprinted instead of darker lettering. This is a fairly minor point, though, since my fingers pretty much know where everything is on the keyboard. My opinion is mixed as to the number pad on the side of the keyboard. I had expected this to be a feature that I liked, but it significantly shortens the width of the rest of the usable keypad. My fingers are going to have to relearn the \"spacing\" of the keys. Things will be slower for awhile.The touch pad doesn't work as well on this one and tends to cause the cursor to jump around a bit. The surface of the touch pad actually rattles and feels like it might be a bit loose.  There is a small *bad spot* on touch pad that does not work at all.  It's a bit annoying for a new laptop; however, it's not a huge problem for me since I generally use a wireless mouse.As with my last VAIO, the center-mounted cam works just fine for Skyping.When you close the lid of the laptop, it goes into power-saving mode...a great feature that was available on my last VAIO.And last, but not least...the Operating System. Ugh. I'm truly trying to be optimistic that it's simply a learning curve and that eventually I'll come to like it as much or even more than Windows 7. There's a long way to go before that happens, though. Old dogs...new tricks, I guess.  (UPDATE 6/4/13:  I'm used to the new operating system now...so it's not an issue.)Bottom line, is that I DO actually like my new laptop. I probably seem a bit critical of it since there are some differences to get used to between it and my last one.", "Date": "May 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Super Fast and Adorable ! !", "Author": "Deborah Leppert \"zukigirl\"", "ReviewID": "R1S8YIJL8HRVNR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My new Sony VAIO is devastating fast and what's more . . . it's pink ! !
