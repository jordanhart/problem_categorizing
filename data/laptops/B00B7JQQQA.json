{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Hard to beat this kind of value", "Author": "D. Simone \"oodanner\"", "ReviewID": "R21K6JZ7TOJWQ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For roughly 550.00 this can hardly be beat for a small laptop that has windows 8 and a touchscreen.  At first I was a little aggravated with the touch pad but, I installed the drivers from Samsung's website that are supposed to be for a series 5 laptop.  This laptop along with several others have the same Elan touch pad in them.  Once you install this driver it is a night and day difference in the touchpad.The link for the drivers is in the first comment.  Amazon won't let you link to an external website in the main review.So go to the comment and get to the link then follow what is below.You then need to click on the Manuals and Downloads link, then click Driver.After that scroll down and click on the ZIP link for the Touch Pad driver 11.7.2.1If you have the sorry Asus Smart Gesture installed, uninstall that first and reboot, then install this software.  I have had various Macbooks for the better part of the last 7 years and this is my first PC laptop in a while.  I was almost ready to return this laptop until I found these drivers.  I would say the touch pad is 95% of a Macbook touch pad now and whether you like Apple or not, you have to admit they know what they are doing when it comes to track pads.  Aside from all of that I'm extremely happy with the operation of this laptop now.I am coming from a laptop that had an SSD drive in it so it does seem a little slow in some areas but, others it is working just fine.  I have an extra SSD drive that I plan on putting in this machine as well as removing the half height mini PCI atheros wireless/bluetooth combo.  I purchased an Intel Centrino 6235anhmw Mini Pci Express Bluetooth 4.0 to replace it with and based on my research I should be able to enable Intel Wireless Display on this laptop after that install.  The card only cost me 30.00 bucks and I figured it was worth the gamble to see if it would work.  I'll update this review once I get the card in a couple of days to state if it worked or not.The sound coming from this laptop is actually quite good and I would say better than a lot of the previous laptops I am use to.The touchscreen is extremely responsive and I haven't had any missed touches or erratic behavior out of it.  I have played several touch based games and it worked flawlessly.Last but, not least this thing is solid, the build quality on it is exceptional for something this cheap.Okay, now for the bad which again considering this is a cheap laptop with a touchscreen really isn't that bad.The fan runs constantly and while it is not overly annoying it does seem to run even when not doing much on the system.  That is really my main complaint about the machine at this point.  The second complaint is that the viewing angles on this machine are pretty poor but, again don't expect any machine at this price point with a touchscreen to have great viewing angles.  Although viewing angles are bad, brightness is very good. I think with the brightness turned all the way up you could possibly do permanent damage to your eyes(a joke of course).The keyboard is a little cramped but, really not all that bad.  I would say I have slightly above average hand size but, again it isn't to bad and I'm able to kick out a reasonable speed without to many more mistakes than I usually make.  Expect some adjustment if you are coming from a full size keyboard with large hands.Again, the stock hard drive is a 5400rpm drive and it does seem a little slow for me but, if you are coming from another mechanical drive then you may not really notice it as a problem.  I've been using SSD drives for some time so it does bother me a bit.These might be major problems for others but, for me they are minor annoyances that I can live with on a cheap machine like this.  This is basically an 11.6\" Macbook Air that is missing the SSD(entry level is 64GB SSD), backlit keyboard, viewing angles aren't as good for the ASUS and fan runs more often than Macbook Air.  However the Macbook Air doesn't have these features: touch screen, 500GB HDD that can be upgraded to a small or large SSD if you like and the Air cost about 450.00 more for the entry level.  Granted the Macbook Air is considerably lighter but, it also makes your wallet lighter.Sorry for all of the Macbook comparisons but, I have come from many years of having Macbooks and decided with Windows 8 to give PCs a try again.  I'm glad I did.Update 11/8/2012:I installed the Intel wireless card I mentioned above, then installed the latest drivers for the card from the Intel website as well as the latest video drivers from the ASUS website.  Then I installed the Widi display software and was able to connect to my Belkin Screencast.  It took several tries and then it finally updated the software on the Belkin.  After that it has been connecting perfectly with no problems.  So I paid 40 bucks on Amazon for a refurbished Belkin Screencast and 32.00 for the intel card. Now for 72.00 bucks I'm able to use my 55\" HDTV at 1080p as a second screen.Update 11/14/2012I finally got around to installing an SSD drive and replacing the mechanical drive.  The drive that came in it was a Hitachi HTS5450A7E380 which is a 7mm thick drive.  Unfortunately the SSD I had was a typical 9.5mm and was too thick to work at first.  Luckily I was able to remove part of the casing on the SSD drive I used and that made for a perfect fit.  So if you plan on swapping out for an SSD make sure it is no thicker than 7mm or it won't fit.  I had some trouble where the laptop kept booting into the BIOS.  when I went in and disabled fast boot as well as turned of drive security or something like that.  I can't remember exactly now but, when the option is enabled you can go further into the BIOS and see PKI keys and DDB keys and a lot of other keys.  I just disabled that portion and then it started recognizing the hard drive.  This may not be a problem if you clone the hard drive to the SSD before you swap but, I did a fresh install.  Laptop is blazing fast now as it boots into windows in about 10 seconds.", "Date": "November 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Setting the Record Straight", "Author": "P. knight \"Speed expert\"", "ReviewID": "R33NO9SGOGX16G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "April 2014: Graphics update. The new updated Intel Graphics driver does NOT allow for customizing brightness, contrast and gamma. Many X202e users including myself have found that setting the brightness to -20, contrast to 51 and gamma to 0.9, makes for richer colours. The default settings look a bit washed out as compared to these custom settings. If you cannot make these changes, it's because you have the newer Intel Graphics driver. Thankfully, you can uninstall it and go download the original driver from the Asus website. This is the version to download, VGA_Intel_Win8_64_Z917102843........................................................................This review is to dispel any incorrect info in the \"User Reviews\".I'll quickly explain that I am a technician and have been modifying all the non touch Win 8 machines, to look and run like 7. It's a 2 minute job that requires a small program like Classic Shell or iobit's Start 8.As I give tech advice on some forums, I felt the need to get some experience on Win 8's touch interface, Otherwise, how could I help others, if I've never even used it.So let's get down to business and set the record straight of what it is, and what it isn't.WIFIThose folks who have wifi connectivity problems, have a defect. If they reinstall the OS from the partition that is provided for that purpose, and then it still has wifi problems, then it's time to return the machine or get it fixed, or even get another wifi card. Anyone who thinks that it's inherent to this machine and has decided to put up with it, is mistaken and being inconvenienced unnecessarily.TOUCHPADThose who find that the touchpad is wonky, are either palming it while typing, or have a defect. The same applies as above. Try installing the OS again and if it is still acting up and you're 100% sure that you're not palming the touchpad, then it is defective and needs to be returned or repaired. This is NOT a normal condition.BUILD & SCREENThis laptop is well built with premium quality materials. Anyone who feels their screen is weak, should return it. It is NOT a normal condition for this machine, and for those who complained about the bezel being too wide, it is built that way to be structurally strong enough. A touchscreen receives light impact from being touched, thus it needs to be built a bit more solidly than a normal screen.Complaints about the screen being shiny are valid in a sense. It is truly shiny, but it's a necessary evil. Matte surfaces get dirty faster and are harder to clean.KEYBOARDThe keyboard is neither exceptionally good or bad. Everyone has a different concept of what a keyboard should be, so there's no right or wrong. It's just an individual's preference. If the keyboard doesn't work perfectly, the machine should be returned or repaired.BATTERY LIFEWe've heard a wide range of claims, from 2 to 7 hours. Obviously, someone is wrong. Most of the User Reviews, have it straight, when they claim approx. 4 hours. Even if you dimmed the screen and avoided multitasking, you'd still be hard pressed to get 5 hours out of it, and it's unrealistic to expect that, as the screen would be hard to see, at that low brightness. Those who have claimed 3 hours or less, may be running power consuming programs, like watching video/movies at full brightness, in which case, it is 100% true that it will only get 3 hours or less, under those conditions.(See Suggestions below for some revised info)CAMERAYes, it is true, that it's horrible. If you are not in a brightly lit area, the image will be grainy. It is certainly way below the quality of the average laptop webcam.(see SUGGESTIONS below for a revised evaluation)POWER & SPEEDThose who find that this notebook is slow, or it hesitates/stutters or freezes up, have a defect. Redo the system as mentioned above and if it persists, it is a defective machine. Even with all the bloatware running, this Vivobook has ample power, to handle all the normal use, without ever hesitating or freezing up.(See SUGGESTIONS below for additional info on power plans for better performance)SSDYes it is true that it will be substantially faster and more responsive, if you swap out the hard drive for an SSD. Any and all laptops will benefit, but it is not necessary to swap the hard drive out, as it performs just fine as it is. It's a luxury to go with an SSD. I have swapped the HD out for an SSD in this machine, because I wanted to know how much of a difference it would make, and not because it ran poorly with the included 500 gig hard drive.While on this subject, those who feel that it is difficult to remove the backplate to access the hard drive, are mistaken. Yes, it is firmly in place and it requires the right tool to pry it apart, but that is entirely normal for almost all laptops. Swapping out the hard drive on this unit, is a breeze.FINGERPRINTSI got lucky and received the Silver model (looks like champagne to me) as the silver lid does not show fingerprints as much as the black version. Again, this is normal. Black brushed aluminum laptops, are fingerprint magnets and they need to be cleaned everyday.VALUEThe sum total of this Vivobook's exceptional build with premium materials, slim and light, great performance, decent battery life, all the necessary ports, good wifi reception and a very decent touchscreen, make it a real bargain at $500 or less.COMMENTS, CONS & COMPLAINTSThe webcam is very poor.It would be wonderful to have a backlit keyboard, even though it would shorten the laptop's battery life.This unit is slow to charge. From bone empty, it may take as long as 4 hours to get to 100%. This may inconvenience some folks (not me), but on the positive side, the internal battery may last several more years than if it were fast charged.A few users have suggested changing graphics setting to -20 brightness, 51 contrast and 0.9 gamma, and I agree that it looks better that way.I ran a timer since turning the laptop on at 100% charged and it is now up to 2 hours and 7 minutes, having used 44% of its battery life, so that would come out to a potential 4 hours and 48 minutes, however the machine will shut down before reaching 0%, and it should be noted that I was only running this webpage and the timer, nothing else, so it would be unrealistic to expect that much battery life under normal circumstances.The Win 8 touch interface is vastly superior to iOS (iPad), Android, webOS or any after market ones. It is true that the store does not have very many apps, but that will come with time. You'd be hard pressed to find any high quality free games, so don't get your hopes up, YET!_________________________________________________edit.SUGGESTIONS1) Download an app called \"Show Me\", which will give you detailed visual explanations of everything you can do in Win 8's touch interface. Even if you think you know it all, I bet you'll learn a few new things.2) Clean the screen around the webcam area and you may discover (as I just did) that the camera is a lot better than it was, presumably a bit dirty from top of the screen swipes.3) If your machine hesitates, stutters or freezes while on battery but performs well when plugged in, you may have to change your power plan to \"High Performance\". The Power4Gear system, halves the CPU, ram graphics and Wifi power. If you do go to High Performance while on battery, you may want to turn down the brightness a bit, so as to improve battery life.4) If you use the Powe4Gear power plan while on battery, it is possible to reach 5 hours of usage, provided you are not running many processes in the background, and are not playing games or viewing video.5) After updating your Vivobook with Asus' Live update program, uninstall it, to stop it running in the background (it can't be stopped otherwise). If you need it again in the future, you can download the installer from the Asus website.6) If you run Windows Defender, there is no need for any additional Anti Virus programs, as Defender in Win 8, is a full Anti Virus program that is reputed to do as good a job as any other free AV program. If you are running another AV program, either uninstall it and use Defender, or keep it and turn Defender off in \"Services\". Running both at the same time will seriously slow down your computer.", "Date": "April 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "upgradeability of the X202E-DH31T", "Author": "Charles Felker \"Special K 42\"", "ReviewID": "RL9MQP0DCZAL8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm an IT professional, and have dealt with a few ASUS laptops, which I now prefer to Dell.If you take remove the 9 phillips screws on the bottom, you have access to some of the internal components.You will need to tug a little, as the case is still held in place by little plastic clippies all around.You might break a nail, so be careful.MEMORY:The memory is soldered into the board, so 4GB is all you will ever have.  Period.DISK DRIVE:The HDD is a Hitachi HTS5450A7E380 (7mm 2.5\") and can be replaced with another \"Low Profile\" 7mm SSD or HDD.  You simply remove 3 screws that hold the cage in (the 4th screw is already removed from removing the back panel), remove the cage, remove 4 screws holding drive in cage,  replace with a SATA II/III drive.  (It is a SATA 3 6.0 GB/s connection).I recommend the Samsung 840 series, as they are 7mm 2.5\" and very low on power usage. When you remove the old HDD, it has a plastic backing glued on it with two rubber foam strips.Don't worry with removing it from the old HDD. An SSD doesn't need the shock absorption and will be mounted securely with the screws.WIRELESS:The Atheros AR5B225 Half Mini PCIe WiFi/Bluetooth 4.0 module is replaceable.I am replacing mine with Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 so I can use WiDi and Dual Band Wifi.It was as easy as removing the two antenna wires from the Atheros, popping in new card, reattaching two antenna wires to the Intel 6235.BATTERY:The 5136 mAh 2 cell battery is replaceable, albeit proprietary.  Not sure what this means for the future.MY GENERAL OPINION OF THE LAPTOP and Windows 8:I have been using Windows 8 at work for a bit, and as an OS, it's hard and confusing with a dual monitor desktop power user setup (as I have no need for the Metro interface there, and I feel like I'm fighting it).  I had to tweak it to get my start menu back (Open source utility called \"Classic Start\").  However, with a touch screen laptop, it is very easy to use.  I've been thoroughly been enjoying it as a tablet replacement.  I admit, I did install an SSD in it, and it is SO much more responsive now (and shaved some ounces on weight as well has dropping at least a watt of power draw).  I also have access to a Windows 8 volume license key, and mine is running Windows 8 Enterprise.", "Date": "November 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "HDD crashed in 2 months... \"Click of Death\"", "Author": "Customer1113", "ReviewID": "R3EL6BT71736MB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The form factor, specs, and cost all made the Vivobook a product that I was excited to have and to recommend to whoever I came across. Of course, the highlight was the touchscreen which is VITAL if you're using Windows 8. Adding to that was the excellent workmanship (metallic palmrest) and the perfect size and weight (liked it better than the Zenbook or MacBook Air).But less than 2 months later, it all turned into a nightmare.I can give the conclusion from the very beginning: Swap out the 500GB HDD for a 256GB SSD as soon as you take it out the box. I'm convinced that Asus put in a cheap part (HDD) in order to keep the cost low. But you will pay dearly for that error.1. During normal usage, the dreaded \"Click of Death\" came, which is when the head/arm in the HDD touches the platter (disk). I tried to shut it down as soon as possible. But the next time it turned on, the OS wouldn't load and only the BIOS screen would appear. The machine was effectively dead.2. Asus's warranty would replace the HDD but wouldn't recover the data, all while taking 2 weeks to return the machine to you. And just opening the machine to swap the HDD yourself would void that warranty.3. Upon opening the HDD, I found that the head was defective (after just 2 months) and tried everything to recover the data. The pros would charge approx $2,400 (no exageration) to repair this kind of HDD problem. After 3 days, this became a lost cause and I knew I'd have to start from scratch.4. I installed a 256GB SSD.5. Asus wouldn't give me an ISO image of the factory Vivobook. They told me I also had to get the OS from Microsoft directly, who in turn said they couldn't get me a full version Windows 8, but only an upgrade from Windows 7. This meant I had to install Windows 7 first, then upgrade to Windows 8.Now I'm stuck because the BIOS won't let me set the boot order to the USB drive. And, yes, I've flashed it to version 206. IF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THIS, PLEASE COMMENT.In spite of all the headache, my only advice is to swap for a SSD immediately. 95% of my docs were backed-up but I didn't make an ISO image of the whole system, so I'm paying for it.In the end, I still think this is a good machine which just had 1 cheap part which went bad very quickly. (BTW, the floor model at the store also had the same problem.)", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not a Netbook... Nearly an ultrabook.", "Author": "Andrew", "ReviewID": "R2C74ST7IRG6ZP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Firstly, some reviewers have referred to this laptop as a netbook. I have nothing against netbooks, but this is actually an ultraportable notebook. In fact, if it had even a hybrid SSD it would meet ultrabook specs. It certainly has the build quality of an ultrabook.The good:- As I said, excellent build quality including the very responsive touchscreen. People have been guessing that I must have paid at least $800 for this machine based on its look and feel alone. It looks and feels like something between a Macbook Air and Pro.- Remarkably thin considering that it has built in VGA and ethernet ports, and yes, some people still need those!- It's fast. Obviously with a Core i3 and 4GB of RAM it's not the most powerful device on the market, but if you're not a gamer or into heavy multimedia editing it runs like a breeze. It boots up faster than ANY computer I have ever seen not equipped with an SSD. I guess Windows 8 is to thank for that.- Speaking of Windows 8, this is a review of the machine not the OS, but I'll just say that it's basically Windows 7 with a better start menu and some handy touched based functionality. On a touchscreen device like this one, I don't see any reason to complain about it.- Incredibly compact power cable. No brick. It's like a tablet charger. You can literally coil it up and carry it in your pocket.The Bad:- Battery life is indeed about 4-5 hours... that is, with careful power management and light use. Not stellar, but I guess it does deliver the \"up to 5 hours\" promised.- A little heavy for its size, certainly not so much to be tiring to carry.- Some reviewers have complained about the trackpad. I haven't updated any drivers and I don't find it to be terrible by any means, but it can be a hair too sensitive at times, sometimes registering a single tap as a double.Overall:I'd actually give it a 4.5 if I could. I've looked into a lot of alternatives, and I don't believe there is currently a better laptop for under $600 on the market right now. Certainly not in the 11.6\" form factor, where the alternatives are either netbooks of inferior build quality and specs, or an ultrabook/Macbook Air for hundreds of dollars more.", "Date": "December 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not Perfect, But For The Price...", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R7RZDUZFIL2EN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I haven't bought a PC laptop in years. I build my own desktops, but when it comes to laptops I stuck with Apple. But lately I began to realize that while the MacBook Pro was a good computer it delivered more horsepower than I actually needed. So I decided to sell it and find a Windows replacement. I needed a basic system that I could take with me on the job and transfer video from an SCHC card to a hard drive. I didn't need a powerhouse laptop. After a bit of searching I settled on the X202E.The main reasons was it was a system taking advantage of the latest technology Windows 8 touted: touch screen. The price was also very reasonable. I got mine used, though Like New, for $470 through a seller here on Amazon. Add a case and an anti-glare screen protector for a grand total of $500. Not a bad price at all for what you get.The touch screen is vibrant and responsive. While not an exceptionally fast system it gets the job done well enough. This is definitely what Windows 8 set to revolutionize and it does it well. I was never a hater of the Metro UI, but didn't see the point on a desktop system with a 20+ inch screen. For a laptop however... it's very nice. I can only imagine how a tablet would be or a Windows 8 phone.The system is minimal input ports: 3 USB, and HDMI, an ethernet port and a VGA port. Why this thing comes with a VGA port is beyond me. For as advanced as the laptop is this port is a pimple on an otherwise beautiful face. If you need an optical drive you're out of luck. This slender thing doesn't have one, so you'll need an external drive if you want/need one.Speaking design it is fairly lightweight and has a nice modern design to it. I actually think it has a nicer design than the MacBook Air, though not quite as thin.I have only two minor issues: the touchpad is extremely sensitive. Even with the updated drivers from Samsung another reviewer recommended, the touchpad will easily misinterpret what you want to do. I'm getting better at it, but it will take a little time to get used to it. Also, you have to press the touchpad buttons a bit harder than you should have to. My other issue is the keyboard isn't backlit. Not a deal breaker, and I realize Asus needed to make sacrifices to keep the price down, but how much would a couple of LED's actually cost? As I said, it would have been nice but not a big deal.One thing to note: I haven't bought a Windows computer in years, but I remember you generally got an activation code with the system, either as a sticker on the computer somewhere or a postcard in the package. Neither were present in this purchase. I contacted the seller and he doesn't remember seeing one either. I'm not sure if this goes for all units or just mind, but this problematic in the event you need to re-install the OS and need the activate it. I managed to get my code using a small program that tracked it down in the registry for me, but you shouldn't have to do this. I'd be curious to hear if others who bought the system new experience the missing activation code. It could also be the way Windows 8 is handled on new systems. I don't know.All-in-all, this is a terrific system, especially for the price. If you want a sleek, modern Windows system you can't go wrong with this one. The 11\" screen doesn't feel small in the least, and I'm very happy with my purchase.UPDATE (11/22/2012): I received word from the seller, as well as independently confirmed with ASUS, that this system does not come with a Certificate of Authenticity. From their support site: \"For Windows 8, activation is done with a new process. There is no need for Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker or entering product key.\"", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just impressive", "Author": "Fixxxer86", "ReviewID": "R21FGZPDNWU9BH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Where do I start?First of all, at this price is impossible to beat this machine (at least in this moment). It is one of the cheapest (if is not the cheapest one out there) wich has the same quality than any other 11.6\" ultrabook... and by \"quality\" I mean the overall performance, materials and aesthetics. Actually if you compare it with any other ultrabook side by side, you won't see any real difference or disadvantage. Yes, there is other little ultrabooks (not notebooks) wich may look \"better\", but probably at twice it's price.The experience with this notebook is just amazing. I've only used it for one week, but it's enough to recognize the potencial that it has. I'll clarify that I changed the HDD for a SSD (Samsung 840 120gb, wich is one of the fastest SSDs out there right now)... this is probably one of the major changes that you would have to consider once you get this machine. There is nothing bad with the normal HDD, and actually it performed really well when I tested it the first day, but SSDs nowadays is another world (boots in less than 8 sec., maybe less if you don't set any password hehe)I did a little bit of everything so far, from multitasking, HD movies, and light gaming. You can play without problems some light game engines, like Source... at the cost of lower details of course. And I can say that everything worked much better than I expected.Now you may think: why should I take a notebook with touch screen capabilities?... Well, at first I thought about this, and only 2 things changed my mind. One that it has Windows 8, and Metro is designed for touch (no problem with mouse, but you will experencie a better feeling using the touch screen) And the second one the price... the cheapest one out there wich also has touch (I said \"why not then...\") And I'll say that I'm not a real lover of touch screen devices, but I'm totally happy that I picked this one... One example of good utility: I was in my bed laid down watching a movie with the notebook over my belly and I couldn't reach or see the keyboard properly... no problem! now I have a touch screen keyboard, cool.For everyone out there wich has problems using Windows 8 because you don't understand how to use it... simple, go to youtube and look for some tutorials about Metro interface and new desktop.SummarizingPROS:- Price!!!- Build quality- Performance- Design, I love it.- Light, even with charger and a wireless mouse in the bag .- Lots of ports for this size (2 usb 2.0, 1 usb 3.0, sd card, rj45, normal hdmi, audio/mic jack in one port, even VGA! incredible)- Big touch pad (and with proper updates it works just fine)- Nice keyboard layout and size- Battery life may or may not be a good thing for everyone in this notebook, but if you upgrade bios and tweak the power saving settings you will get a good amount of battery (3 to 4hs at high performance tasking, or 5 to 6hs at light performance tasking).- Touch screen!- Decent TN panel wich has nice color contrast and brightness (and also viewing angles are not that bad)- Sound quality is very nice! I was impressed the first time I listened to a song.- Some people have changed the wifi adaptor for better range or stability. I didn't, and so far it worked well!- Probably some other thing that I'm skipping right now heheNow, you will say... why this guy put 4 stars instead of 5 if it is that good and he is so happy? hahaWell, nothing in this world is perfect and I'm a picky person (even more with technology) BUT listen, nothing of this cons are major drawbacks, and actually are minor details wich some can be solved by simple ways.CONS:- Glare screen. Yes, it is glare and it may be difficult to read with excesive light. Easily solved by some anti-glare protective lcd screen.- It takes finger prints easily.- It takes some time to be fully charged (battery).- No illuminated keyboard. At this price we can't argue about this, I know it... but I always want more hahaha.- No replaceable battery.- No memory upgrade capabilities.Well, that's it!And the last thing... some technical comments to be ready:As I said, I changed the HDD for a SSD. No problems with this, just deactivate boot protection in bios. I used Acronis True Image 2013 (burned into a cd, and I used an external dvd that I have) to clone HDD into SSD, be careful here because not every software works with my SSD or this bios. With Acronis 2013 I had no problems!This comment and any other aspect of the technical part are commented in other reviews.Go!!! What are you waiting for? Go and I pick one! hahahaGreetings and happy 2013", "Date": "January 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS X202E Tweaking Guide", "Author": "Robert Salita \"Software Developer\"", "ReviewID": "RLTEWCBYIIP7C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update 26-Jun-2013: Hurray! The touchpad issues have been normalized with a driver update from ASUS. I downloaded and installed SmartGesture_Win7_8_VER201 from ASUS website. It fixes the issues with the touchpad. However, I still prefer turning off all features in ASUS Smart Gesture except for single touch \"Select\" and \"Activate\". Also, I prefer, in Control Panel->Mouse->Pointer Options, select \"Fast\" in pointer speed and check \"Enhanced pointer precision\". These have been a major improvement so I've raised my rating to a full 5 stars.Update 18-Mar-2013: Wanted to specifically mention that battery endurance is impressive for my usage. I can get up to four hours of web surfing if I needed it. I find that I'm more productive with this computer because the processor and SSD (user upgrade) are quite fast. My morning web surfing episodes are noticeably shorter.Update 15-Mar-2013: I improved the touchpad by installing ASUS touchpad driver from their website and customizing features. The current driver is named SmartGesture_ASUS_Win7_8_VER1036.zip. Once installed, double click the ASUS SmartGesture icon in the taskbar (usually bottom-right on desktop). My preference, YMMV, was to uncheck all features except Select and Activate. I still don't like the touchpad but now it's more predictable. I also changed Control Panel->Mouse->Pointer Options->select-a-pointer-speed a couple notches faster.The ASUS X202e (ASUS S200e) is an excellent value despite its flaws. Here's some tweaks to share. Some require hacker-level experience. I use the X202e mainly for web surfing. Your tweaks may vary with use case.1. Replace the hard drive with an SSD for much faster speed. The processor is quite fast for web surfing but you'll really appreciate the added speed of an SSD. I only need a 60GB+ SSD for my usage. Be sure the SSD is a 7mm height drive such as a Samsung 840.2. I hate bloatware. I reinstalled Windows 8 from a generic 64-bit Windows 8 DVD. No activation key was needed. The only driver I needed beyond what Windows 8 installed was the audio drivers for the microphone. I downloaded from ASUS support web page. I installed using a generic USB DVD drive.3. The default screen settings make the display a bit washed out looking. To fix, right click on the desktop->Graphics Properties->Display->Color Enhancements. Change Brightness to -20, Contrast to 51 and Gamma to 0.9.4. I use Ninite.com to quickly install many often used programs.5. I swear the touchpad has been improved by an initial cleaning. I used window cleaner.6. I haven't found a better touchpad driver than the stock Windows 8 driver. I'm open to alternate drivers. Please make recommendations in comments but please, document any non-standard settings.7. I reset the BIOS to defaults and then chose \"Optimal Settings\". Don't assume the manufacturer installed with optimal settings selected.8. I love Windows 8 but only when with the Windows 7 shell, so I installed EX7FORW8 software. Recommended. Touch continues to work.With these tweaks, you'll get a much better X202E experience. I'm hoping a new driver will improve the too touchy touchpad. Yes, the screen could be a bit better but it's acceptable. Battery life is ample with my usage. I get about 4 hours web surfing -- more than expected and more than needed for my usage.", "Date": "February 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not too big, not too small, just right", "Author": "McBain \"wgars1234\"", "ReviewID": "RTHDQIGT4O5KW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought mine from the Microsoft store a couple days ago.

Geiger", "ReviewID": "R32MQ91VDGR1DQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought one of these this past weekend from a Microsoft retail store (where it is $499) and could not be happier so far. It is to be used mostly by my wife, but I plan on doing some writing and occasional work on it.Both of us love it. It is thin and light, but very solid. The build quality is way beyond what I expected from a $500 laptop. The shallow keypress on the chiclet keyboard takes some getting used to, but I was acclimated after only a few minutes. The touchscreen is responsive and, I have to admit, a lot of fun. I have had my eye on various tablets lately, but this thing blows them away. It is essentially as portable as a 10\" tablet, but way more functional with its full version of Windows 8. Contrary to what some might fear, we never had any problems with the screen being pushed backwards when touched. The hinge is stiff enough to withstand touch, but never a hindrance.The trackpad feels slightly imprecise, and sometimes the Windows 8 gestures, when made on the trackpad, need to be repeated. But overall it is one of the nicer trackpads I have used on a laptop.Windows 8 itself is a lot of fun to use with a touch screen. The apps are helpful and mostly well-designed. Our one issue so far has been that deleted photos still show up on the Pictures livetile. That is a pretty bad oversight, but one solely at the hands of Microsoft, not Asus.The included Asus software is extremely unintrusive. Bloatware is definitely at a minimum.Everything runs very smoothly so far, despite the absence of an SSD.Ultimately, this is the most fun, most exciting laptop I have ever owned (had various laptops years ago by Toshiba and HP, and also a PowerMac G4). It also happens to be the cheapest laptop I have ever bought. Never would have thought I could get a package this great with such a low pricetag. If you are in the market for a new Windows portable, you should definitely give this one a serious look.", "Date": "November 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice portable system, with touchscreen, that performs well enough", "Author": "terpfan1980 \"Barry\"", "ReviewID": "R3345452K0LZC5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I knew going into the purchase of this system, which I must admit I didn't make with Amazon (unfortunately, the rewards that my credit card company offered were from another retailer, and were enough to help me choose where I would make the purchase of this device at), that I wasn't going to be getting the fastest or absolute best ultrabook system.  At the same time, I also knew I wasn't going to be spending the kind of money that I'd have to spend for such a system.After finally getting a chance to showroom one of these systems - which admittedly I had to do a few times since one of the stores that I saw one in had one that needed to be reloaded (which scared me a little) due to Windows system issues, and another had fairly poor wireless network coverage which meant part of the testing that I wanted to do couldn't be considered completely successful or utterly failed (the third time was the charm as I was able to get in what I considered a full suite of testing of streaming video in both SD and HD from UltraViolet partner sites, as well as some YouTube video and local (sample) file video playback as well; all of which passed with flying colors) -- I was left assured that the performance on one of these nice little systems was going to be where I wanted it to be at.A couple of negative comments, from co-workers as well as my own, as I've demoed my nice little device to them a few times:* the screen isn't that great when viewing from the side.  Looking at it head-on, it's fine, but viewing from a bit of an angle, it isn't as clear as one might like.For me, that's a minor concern, as I wouldn't normally be viewing from an angle.  My machine, me using it, I'll be looking at it head-on.  Apparently the touchscreen does make the side angles a little less clear (a bit of interference so to say) but again, not enough to really bother me when I can focus head-on at the screen.* battery life isn't as long as one might hope.Again, not that big a deal for me.  Unless I were seated on a cross-country flight, I don't expect that I couldn't find power somewhere to plug into.  Worst case, I have solutions for the recharging needs that I can rely upon to get me through a longer period if necessary.  4+ hours, which is relatively easily achieved here, is good enough for my needs in almost all cases.While not as long as an iPad or other tablet device might offer, or as long as higher-end ultrabook devices could offer, this is certainly good enough.* CPU performance isn't overly impressive.Probably not, as some people will always want faster and better, but certainly good enough for my needs.* Memory can't be upgraded/expanded to add more.True, and that is disappointing.  ASUS opted to go with soldered in memory so the 4GB that this device has installed is all it'll likely ever see (since I'm not likely to get the installed memory removed by someone with appropriate soldering skills).  I wish it had another few GB of RAM installed or at least that it was possible to add a couple more GB of RAM to it, but for most usage, 4GB is plenty.* It comes with Windows 8 basis, not Professional.See additional comments/thoughts on this below.  (For most people, likely not an issue.)* No built-in Optical drive.True, but this really isn't an issue at this point as portable optical drives are readily available and the use of optical media continues to be marginalized more and more.  Unless I wanted to play DVDs with it, I don't know that I'd be concerned at all as so many things are now sold in downloadable digital form, or in streaming form so the need for actual physical media is nearly nil.* The bezel is a little large, making the entire system a little bigger than one would expect in a device with \"only\" an 11.6-inch screen.True.  This is likely also necessary to account for the touchscreen components and it offers the side benefit of making the device big enough to feature a full-sized keyboard rather than having to go with something smaller and more cramped.What this little system does well for me is:* It's inherently portable while still offering a nice size screen for viewing videos on* It has the touchscreen so I can use touch and gestures within Windows 8 when and where I would want.* It has a full-fledged and full-sized keyboard built-in so I need not be stuck using the on-screen keyboard.* It has a touchpad built-in so I can use that if I'd prefer instead of using the touchscreen (or in conjunction with the touchscreen).* It includes USB 3.0 support, with one built-in USB 3.0 port.* It has plenty of storage capacity built-in so I can easily hold a good sized library of digital copies within iTunes (for example)* It plays videos, including within iTunes, perfectly well so I can use this device as a media consumption device instead of using an iPad or other tablet device while still having full blown Windows installed for my own use of just about any Windows PC program that I might ever want to run.I would note that this device comes with Windows 8, not Windows 8 Professional.  I did go back and upgrade the device to Windows 8 Professional so I could add the Media Center components that Microsoft decided to split out from the basic system.  In doing that I was able to configure this device to use a tuner from my Windows 7 desktop system with Ceton InfiniTV card installed to turn this system into, for me, the ultimate media device within my home.  Thanks to it's adequate CPU speed and overall horsepower, I can watch TV on it via the remote tuner, watch streaming movies/TV shows, or use it to do, well, what others would call real work via Microsoft Office.", "Date": "May 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best value out there.

I will start off by saying I am a college student who had been using an android tablet to take with my to school to take notes, browse the web etc. While the tablet was excellent for portability, I just needed something a little more powerful that would allow me to use software like Microsoft Office. I saw this unit a few weeks after the Windows 8 launch, and I figured this would be perfect; and it is, for me. I'll only talk about this laptop, not whether or not Windows 8 is good.UNIT:You can tell this laptop was built well. For an 11\" laptop, it's very light (only like 3 lbs), but at the same time still feels very solid. I really like that ASUS made most of the body an aluminum/metal frame. The underside of the laptop has a smooth, grippy rubber-like texture to it. Overall it looks very nice, similar to a macbook.The screen itself is fairly unremarkable. It has your standard 1366x768 resolution, so nothing incredible; the small screen size helps it out though. Viewing angles on this screen are okay, there are a few angles that are hard to view the screen from. The bezel could have been made smaller, but it isn't distracting.The touchscreen is very responsive, I have had no troubles using the laptop just using the touchscreen. It is a fingerprint magnet, like any other touchscreen though. ASUS was kind enough to include a microfiber cloth to wipe away those smudges.The keyboard is nice; coming from an ASUS transformer keyboard, this feels so much better. While it is smaller than your standard keyboard (only by a little) it still feels comfortable to type. My keystrokes are very quiet with this. Back lighting would be nice, but for a <$500 computer I'm not complaining.As far as the touchpad goes, I don't have any complaints about it. I know some people have been saying that it's over-sensitive, but I almost feel like mine isn't sensitive enough. When scrolling through websites it takes a little more effort using the two-finger gesture than I thought it would. I'm kinda neutral on the touchpad, mainly because I end up using the touchscreen more often.As far as ports go, there's 2 USB 2.0 and 1 USB 3.0, which is cool. I don't have any USB 3.0 drives so I haven't been able to comment on the speed yet. It also has a card reader, VGA input, as well as HDMI.The webcam is okay, I wasn't expecting anything great from a 0.3MP camera. It does the job when I want to sit in bed and Skype the girlfriend though.I find that I like the audio quality from the speakers. As with any laptop, the sound quality from the speakers isn't going to be great. That being said though this thing can get pretty loud, and it actually sounds pretty good. I was surprised when I listened to a few songs just to test out the audio quality.I really like that the A/C adapter for this unit is so small, similar to a tablet/cell phone charger. Makes carrying that around class a whole lot easier.As far as fan noise goes: when I'm sitting in bed using it, it does sound pretty loud, and is constantly running even if im just web browsing. Though it's not terribly distracting. When I'm in class, I can't even hear the fan.COMPONENTS:If you're wanting to play the latest video games with full detail or run heavy movie editing with this, than you shouldn't even be looking at this product. That being said the 3rd gen i3 is plenty powerful enough to run your everyday tasks and then some. Even the integrated graphics aren't too shabby; you can play source games with no hitch.The best part about the hardware components of this laptop is the 500gb hard drive. Yes, it's only 5400rpm, but I like that I have that much storage for whatever. For those who want faster speeds, you can upgrade the hard drive to a 7mm SSD, which I will probably do in the future.Battery life on the unit decent. It's rated at 5 hours but I've been getting around 4 tops. ***There is a BIOS update that adds to the battery life, but nothing extreme***As far as the WiFi goes, I have noticed that my connection isn't as powerful, and I may replace the card like other users have. But it does work.OVERALL:You aren't going to get blazing speeds from a unit like this, but it is still pretty darn fast. For me, a college student who was looking for a portable option to do work on, this is perfect. And for <$500, you're getting a whole lot of laptop for the money.***There is a new BIOS update (ver 205) that ASUS released a few weeks ago.

Only had it for a week, still learning windows 8 but I kind like it. Some people mentioned that the touchpad is too sensitive but I found it fine. Maybe because I am used to another asus eee pc which has similar sensitivity. Does the Samsung touchpad driver have other useful touchpad gestures though?What I don't like:Fan keeps running and the bottom still gets a little warm although the BIOS is already 206. Also I keep hearing this high pitch sound (a tiny sound but still annoying especially in quiet places) which sounds like something getting spinned up a bit then slow down, repeatedly. Not sure if that's from HDD or the fan. The HDD sometimes also makes clicking sound which is louder than I expected. Maybe I'll get a SSD later.Edit: It charges very slowly! Other reviewer mentioned this but I thought it's like my old eee pc that it charges fast to somewhere about 80% in 1 hour then slowly go up to 100%. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. The x202e charges at a constant speed, and it takes about 4 hours to fully charge it.

Anything larger would have been too big. However the 11.6\" screen is not too small. It's very east to see and read text. Of course you can use a two finger gesture on either mouse pad or screen to enlarge the text. Reports of it running hot and noisy are just not true. I can watch Netflix for hours and it's barely warm to the touch. You can't hear the fan unless you stick your ear right up to it. Even then it's barely audible.I also bought this to replace my desktop. I have a Dell Inspiron 580 with i3 processor, 4GB ram and a 750 GB hard drive. This laptop has basically the same specs, just a smaller hard drive.I put this Vivobook on my desk and use a wireless mouse. I put in multi-monitor mode with extended desktop. I use an HDMI cable to attach my 24\" monitor. I can watch Netflix on the 24\" and still work productively on the laptop. It works great, nice smooth video, uninterrupted by anything I do on the laptop screen.The wifi works great. On my desk the speeds as tested by Speedtest.net were just as fast as when I used an Ethernet cable. It recognized all wireless networks up to at least 2 or 3 houses away from mine.the laptop speakers are nice, rich and clear, but not super loud. I have a pair of Harmon Kardon speakers hooked up through the headphone jack.Battery life is as advertised, 3.5 to 4 hours. Boot time from off is only about 30 seconds.

Yes, even though the screen wobbles slightly when touched, it is a non issue. It doesn't affect the touch gestures at all.there are only a few things I could say negatively. 1.  I would have preferred a matte screen. The glossy screen is a fingerprint magnet, so they give you a cleaning cloth with it.  Also in certain situations there are reflections, but not when just looking head on indoors. 2. The keyboard lettering is not bright white like my Dell desktop keyboard. Which makes it a little hard to type in low light. However the keyboard is very responsive and easy to type with. It just takes a little getting used to if you're used to a full size desktop keyboard.  I wish the battery was easily replaceable like most laptops and an extended battery was available. However I believe it can be replaced by removing the back cover. Also, the memory is not upgradeable, it's soldered in I hear.All being said, I like the Vivobook very much and the price was right at $499, just at my budget maximum.And it has worked flawlessly for the month I've had it.

Carbone", "ReviewID": "R28YJZDVJOL48Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this model a couple of weeks ago. I have purchased four Asus netbooks since 2007 and I still have all but the first one I bought (which was still running fine but had become obsolete in many ways, so I donated it).  So as you can tell, I was a big fan of Asus netbooks.  While the netbook era seems to have ended, I still wanted something that was a lot like a netbook: Highly portable, lightweight, sufficiently powerful to do most anything I need to do on a laptop, highly affordable, and durable enough to be taken on airplanes, to coffee shops, or wherever.This new Asus does the trick!Positives:First of all, at approximately $500, you are going to have difficulty finding this overall set of features and performance in a very small footprint laptop - period.  Now if you want to spend $1000 or more, you will get a more upscale set of components elsewhere (including the Asus Zenbook offerings). The question is whether you need or will even notice the better performance. But assuming you like the notion of a modest, $500 investment, the Q200E is very worthy of consideration.The upsides of the Q200E: Very thin profile, weighs less than 3 lbs, nicely responsive 11.6 inch touch screen, runs Windows 8 and applications swiftly, starts up fast (like most of the \"ultrabooks\"), solidly built with an aluminum case, very good keyboard - especially for its size, attractive design (looks more expensive than it is), 3 USB ports (1 is 3.0), excellent sound from the speakers (surprisingly, the best I've heard - including from larger, more expensive laptops), a highly portable power adapter (no \"brick\") and a 500 GB hard drive that's more than sufficient.The downsides: The Intel i3 processor (1.8 GHz) is fast enough for anything I might do on this little computer, but folks who have very intensive computing needs will want a higher end, faster processor.  Again, for my needs, I haven't experienced any limitations, but I'm not running computer aided design software or creating animation...  Also, this unit comes with 4 GB RAM, which is not upgradeable.  Would you need more? I don't, but if you think you will, you need a higher end laptop with more RAM or at least expansion capability.  As for the screen, it is supposedly HD and I would describe it as \"decent,\" it is simply not the kind of ultra HD screen you will get on a $1500 laptop.  But then, if you want that level of resolution, you might also want a 13\" screen or larger so you can really enjoy the advantages. I find that the 11.6\" screen, while an upgrade for me personally from the 9 or 10 inch netbook screens, is still a bit smallish in terms of either serious movie watching or working for more than a few hours at a stretch. The battery life is unfortunately not in the realm of the little Asus netbooks with 6-cell batteries -- this unit has a 2-cell Lithium battery that is good only for 3 to 4 hours. It's also not easy to change it without unscrewing about 10 screws, so this unit will not provide those 6 or 7 hour marathons like the aforementioned netbooks. (If Asus were to come out with a replacement 4-cell battery for this unit, it would be a major upgrade! I'm going to keep my fingers crossed). Finally, I noted that some reviewers commented about the fan running frequently. I can tell you here and now that first of all, once I completed all of the Asus software updates, the fan seemed to run much less often. But regardless, the fan is very quiet. Unless you are working in a sound isolation chamber and are very distractable, believe me -- fan noise is not going to be an issue for you.The verdict: If you are comparing the Q200E to l1 or 13 inch laptops that cost $1000-$1500, you will find it lacking. No surprise!  However, if you are not a \"super user\" and evaluate this unit in terms of its $500 price tag, you will be pleased. I give it 4.5 stars!----------------------------------------------REVISED REVIEW -- 2 WEEKS LATER----------------------------------------------Well, I am revisiting this review because about 2 weeks after my original review (and only a month into owning this Asus), the hard drive failed. Up to that point, this little computer worked great -- just as I described above.  But one day, upon being shut down, the hard drive made some funny clicking noises.  I thought it was strange but paid no heed until the next day, when I tried to power it back on.  I could get only the system setup (Bios) screen, and nothing would work from there. Various tests returned messages about System Failure etc.  I called Asus technical support, and spent 35 minutes wasting my time with the protocol, only for the tech to conclude what I knew: the hard drive had failed.  He directed me back to BestBuy.  The technical guy at BestBuy examined the computer to make sure I hadn't tampered with it and he booted it up and checked it out.  Same conclusion.  Because it was so new, they actually offered me to exchange for a new one, or issue a refund.  My confidence in Asus a bit shaken, I took the refund.As a result of my experience, I'm knocking off a star.  But I'm not giving an even lower rating because every brand does experience a failure rate. The BestBuy tech told me that it was the first Asus of this type to come back; he noted another brand that he saw returned frequently for failed hard drives (I won't repeat the brand here, since this is basically hearsay).  He noted that his experience so far had been that this model Asus (and Asus in general) are quite reliable, but as he pointed out, if they make 100,000 of them and there's a 1% failure rate, that's still a 1000 defective units....So it might still be worth a try, despite my experience. This Asus seemed very solidly built and has a great form factor. It's too bad this happened but you might have better luck.

This laptop fit that need perfectly. It is just the right size, easy to type on, and extremely light. I also love that the ASUS has the touchscreen and the computer, itself, is built really solid. Honestly it is built much better than the main laptop that I use. After having it for a week and downloading several software programs, it still runs super fast.I have heard several people complaining about Windows 8 but I have to admit, while it is very different, if anyone has owned a tablet or a smart phone, the transition to Windows 8 will be seamless - because of the touchscreen. I couldn't image trying to navigate the system without having that key element.The only downside of my order was not the ASUS computer but was the case I ordered.

To my surprise, they didn't run out of stock on this.I used enough laptops to know a good one when I see it. I own a HP dm1z-2000 laptop, it served me well with windows 7. I installed windows 8 on it several days ago, and the experience has been a mixed bag.Windows 8 is smooth, pretty, fast. But sometime it doesn't make sense on my dm1z. Windows 8 is an attempt by microsoft to marry the touch UI with classic UI. It largely worked. no matter which UI you are using, it works. What doesn't work, is when you transition from one UI to the other. This awkwardness threw people off constantly.Then I got ASUS X202E. It simply works. The awkward transition between two UIs on a non-touch screen laptop mostly disappeared. The touch screen gestures serve the purpose exceedingly well.Windows 8 is meant to be touched, if you gonna buy a non-touch device, get a Windows 7 for cheap, without a touch screen, Windows 8 is somewhat broken.X202E has other pros as well. It's running pretty cool, decent battery life, 3-4 hours. maybe 5 if you use it conservatively. It has a reasonably good processor with an Intel HD 4000 graphic card. It's by no means powerful, but sufficient to run some games ( I heard Diablo 3 works fine on it).It has one USB 3 port, 2 USB 2 ports, HDMI, SDHC.

And everything worked, so thanks everyone!Overall, the laptop is really nice at $474. An SSD is highly recommended to make it much faster and more responsive. Thats really the only bottleneck of this laptop.Intel 400HD performs well for all tasks (videos, flash) except for serious gaming.After days of frustration, here's how I cloned the HD onto smaller SSD (very simple, free, 1 hour):1) Buy sata adaptor (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0064VP73E/ref=oh_details_o01_s00_i03?ie=UTF8&psc;=1) $10. This allows you to connect your SSD through USB2) With SSD plugged to USB open control panel > Disk management. It will say \"you need to initialize the disk\" there YOU MUST SELECT GPT (very important, don't select MBR)3) Again in disk management right click on the C drive and select shrink. This will set unused parts of C to be unallocated.4)install Macrium Reflect FREE edition5)Very straightforward to use, when cloning disk, toggle off the Recovery drive (you don't need that one and it is too big to fit on SSD) and copy over the data with default settings. (takes 30 minutes)6) shutdown and take out HD, put in SSD and fire it up. (There are no hidden screws to unscrew, but still the cover is pretty hard to open, you just need to carefully force it.)7) from control panel, disable weekly drive defragmentation (SSDs shouldn't be defragmented)Review on WIDI (not this laptop, but WIDI technology): setup is tedious (download lots of drivers as other reviewers noted). needs to have line of sight to the Push2TV adapter and be 5-10 feet away, otherwise it will keep disconnecting. Decent performance for youtube and netflix (watchable). Lagged when streaming videos through some other websites that use flash plugin.The intel wifi is $30 and a WIDI adaptor is $60. So if you're willing to spend it just to play around with this new infant technology then go for it.

The chicklet keyboard on this 11.6\" laptop is shrunk slightly but even with my large hands there was plenty of space to type at full speed, and thanks to the metal body, the keyboard has only the tiniest bit of flex when pressed very hard.The responsive touch screen coupled with Windows 8 is a nearly perfect showcase of Microsoft's new OS and Apps, however due to the 5400rpm HDD, there can be slight lag when launching apps or installing updates. The 4GB of RAM and i3 processor have proven to be more than capable of running the majority of programs and apps users will want with no hiccups.This is not a powerhouse of a computer; it is not a gaming laptop or a video editing device. But if you are looking for an attractive, light, reliable laptop that feels like something brand new, this is it thanks to ASUS' attention to detail and the built-in touchscreen.Edit: I have not had enough time to fully review the laptop yet, but wanted to throw something up since there is a stark absence of both customer and professional reviews. There are lots of Windows 8 devices out, but the Vivobook is one of the most affordable ways you can get the whole experience.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "What a great device!", "Author": "paulsz28", "ReviewID": "R1XKQ8QYZ0QRZ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Overall Impression-WOOOOWWWW!  What a slick device.  It's a toy, it's a business laptop, it's an HTPC, it has a touchscreen, ports galore, crazy fast speed - what else could you want?!?!  I've been building my own high-power gaming desktops for 15 years, but man, this thing truly is an all-in-one device that doesn't disappoint.  It only costs $500-ish, but has 95% of the features of $1,400 ultrabooks.  Unless there is a specific feature you need, this laptop could fit the majority of people's computing needs, excel at most of them, and even provide some nifty, state of the art features to put a smile on your face.Our Intended Uses-Wife uses it for business, some pleasure;  We use it as HTPC when needed for watching Hulu, ESPN3, etc. online, or for pushing email/Office to the big screen for work use.  I use it for some touchscreen games.Screen, Keyboard and Touchpad-I kind of use touchscreen and touch pad and keyboard interchangeably (it's very natural - games are nice).  It's normally easiest to point with my finger on the touchsreen and then type on the keyboard - this technique pretty much eliminates the touchpad altogether.-Screen is OK (coming from a gamer who's used to 24\"+ high-resolution, high-contrast, very bright screens), not overwhelmingly knock your socks off superb, brightness is fine, resolution is fine for this screen size, color reproduction isn't perfect, blacks aren't perfect.  All in all, only enthusiasts would notice this things small screen faults.  Nobody else would even pick up on them, so this shouldn't keep anyone from buying this.  The screen doesn't wash out in a sun-lit living rooming, nor now in this dimly-lit room does the screen bother me (brightness turned down).-Touch Pad is just any other touchpad.  Although some of the gestures do match the touch screen, which is nice so as to not be confusing (scroll up and down matches the screen, not regular touchpad scrolling).  I did upload the Samsung drivers, which did help a little bit of the jitteryness and sensitivity.-Keyboard (chiclet keys, good size, nice resistance, don't click at the bottom)-Haven't used on screen keyboard, so I can't spak to how it works.  Not sure why anyone would use that when you have a wicked good chiclet keyboard under your fingers anway.Storage-The laptop comes with a 500GB, 7200RPM, SATAIII drive.  Within hour of turning on the laptop, I had already powered down, taken off teh back (10 screws??) and installed a Samsung 7mm 840 SSD.  This SSD pegs at it's rated specs (540/130 read/write).  This laptop now boots to a useable screen in 8 seconds, the length of a bull ride!-Having taken out the original 5400RPM SATA drive, I put it in an Anker external USB 3.0 encloser which produces speeds of 110/110 R/W (not sure if hard drive maxed out or port maxed out).-I used Samsung's data transfer software to clone the 500GB factory image to my 120GB SSD.  In all it only took 30-45 minutes for the transfer.Size-Although listed as a 11.6\", the frame is more of a 13\"-14\" laptop.  The 11.6\" slip case I orignially bought did NOT fit, so I upgrade to a 14\" courier bag with enough space including pockets for accessories (charger, external HDD, etc.).-The laptop weighs 3lbs, which I guess some people think is heavy, but it's really not.  If you were try to hold it with your arm outstretched for 20 minutes, then yes, it would feel heavy (a bird would feel heavy at that length and duration, though).  Sitting on my lap, it's not heavy, and when on a table/desk, I don't even feel the weight, so of course it's not a bother there.Processor-Intel Processor coupled with an SSD makes this laptop respond instantenously to requests to bootup MS Office applications (instantaneous, literally).  It's a great processor (Sandy Bridge core??) that is low-power, high-output, and even has an integrated graphics processor (IGP).  Not much to say here, as contemporary processors have been \"fast enough\" for 10 years or so, to the user's perception of speed is more of a result of storage/RAM speed and input response than the processor itself.  No complaints in this department.  Moving on.Speakers and Camera/Microphone-The laptop comes with phenomenal speakers.  Now, these aren't reference monitors for sure, but for an 11.6\" laptop, the sound reproduction far exceeds expectations.  They'll surely impress you.-The camera was a letdow, though.  I think it maxes out a 0.9MP while in video mode.  Still pictures don't look much better.  I guess this is one of those features your would have to pay $200-$300 more to get a good 12MP camera or something built in.-Microphone is just OK.  Not impressive, not crappy.  It's kind of cheap (as in the quality of audio picked up), but it gets the job done.-You could use this laptop for Skype, but the person on the other end will probably see a granulated picture.Windows 8-Initial impressions: This laptop was my first real experience with Windows 8, and I have to say it's not all that it could be.  In all, jumping back and forth between the Start Screen and Desktop is confusing and aggravatig.  Win8 being so different than anything Windows users have used before, it should really come with a detailed tutorial available somewhere as a Tile or on the Desktop.  Neither of those exist, so we just kind of figured out stuff as we went along.-The Win8 Start Screen is geared towards media consumption and social crap, all of which I consider a waste of time.  My wife and I are busy people, so all of this Facebook, Skybe, Youtube, Hulu look-at-me-type-stuff is just keeping people down so they don't go out into the world and do stuff useful with their lives.-Windows 8 has a split personality - it's not sure if it wants to be Windows 8 or Windows 7.  By that I mean some applications/apps run solely in the Win8 environment, while others (even if there is a tile for it on the Win8 Start Screen) jump to the familiar Win7 desktop and open the program there.  To me, a PC builder, that's confusing.  To my wife, it's frustrating.  There is a Win8 Internet Explorer, and Win7 IE - the two, from what I can tell, do not share any favorites, settings, etc., so we spend time hunting our favorites only to realize it's in THE OTHER browser.-Win8 Adobe isn't as fully-featured as Win7 Adobe, so when Win8 Adobe wouldn't open some files correctly, I disabled it and made Win7 Adobe the default PDF reader . . . but then it always jumps to desktop to open Win7 Adobe.  Another frustration, because when I'm done, I have to go back to whatever I was doing in Win8 by using some swipe gesture or something.-There is no Start button on the desktop, so unless you know how to navigate through folders and create shorcuts on your desktop, the desktop is largely devoid of anything.-Excel/Word open on the desktop, even if you're on the Start Screen (an aggravation).-There is no default clock on the Start Screen, so you have to hunt through the Store to find one.  It took me trying out about 5 apps to find one that would show a live tile with a clock that updated manually.  Sounds like a mouthful of a task, but it's a really simple idea.  Tell me: WHY does the Start Screen NOT have a clock and calendar?-Apps (on the Win8 Start Screen) are different and independent from the applications most users are accustomed to (on the Win7 Desktop).  Again, there are two Internet Explorers, two Adobes, two Mail programs - it makes NO SENSE!-The Store is available for whatever Apps you're missing, although I wasn't able to find full-blown Applications.  Excited to have a toucscreen laptop, I went hunting for Angry Birds.  The original AB isn't even available!  The only ones that I saw were like the Star Wars version and somethign else, both of which I would have had to pay for.  What a ripoff!  Just give me the dang ad-laiden versions like from Android and let me have my Angry Birds!-Even though you can somewhat manually organize the Tiles, there are some built-in restriction where Win8 tries to \"help\" you organize the Tiles, locking you into a preset geometry.  Dude, let ME decide how I was MY STUFF organized.  Why are there restrictions in the first place?Software-Bloatware is minimal on the laptop.  It comes pre-loaded with some Asus LifeFrame, caculator, and a few other Asus-braned things.  They're not bothersome so I've not uninstalled them.-The laptop comes pre-loaded with Adera, a Myst-type game where you have to search around, solve puzzles, etc.  It's extremely well-suited to touchscreen input, and the game actually looks pretty decent.  However, once you beat the first episode, you have to pay $5.99 for each of the last two episodes.  That's like how a drug dealer acts - gets you hooked on a taste, but if you want more, you have to pay.  I uninstalled the game, even though I wanted to see how it ended, just based on the bait-and-switch principle.-The laptop has McAfee securit software preloaded with some trial offer.  I uninstalled that and enabled Windows Defender and all of its little buddies, as it's free,  isn't a resource hog, and for the most part stays out of my way.-Office 2010 trial is loaded on the laptop, but I uninstalled that and loaded Office 2007.  It works fine with the touchscreen (it's actually pretty pleasant working in Excel with a touchscreen).  Office applications load in seemingly less than a second, which has a lot to do with the SSD.PORTS-The laptop has one USB 3.0 port and 3 USB 2.0.  It also has VGA and HDMI, ethernet, headphone, and a MMC/SD slot.  What else do you need?USB-The 1:3 ratio of 3.0 to 2.0 is the perfect mix, as I use the single 3.0 port for the aforementioned external HDD(lots of data movement requiring high speeds) and the other 2.0 ports for slower devices (wireless mouse/keyboard receiver/transmitter for when using hte laptop as HTPC, charging phones, etc.).HDMI-HDMI works great (Intel HD4000) for streaming ESPN3 to big screen TV, although things did look a shade darker than my other input devices would (and I even tweaked the picture to compensate for the darkness).  I'm not sure if this is the \"fault\" of the streaming broadcast or a limitation in the HD4000 IGP.  I was watching a football bowl game via streaming ESPN3 over HDMI to the TV and my wife tought I was watching via over-the-air broadcast, because the pictre looked so good.  Now, don't kid yourself, it's not literally as good as OTA, but unless you're looking for sprites or artifacts of streaming data, you won't notice and picture degradation.-However, when teh screen is shut and I'm pushing the video over HDMI the to the TV< I can see that thetouch screen is still receiving inputs, so I have to put a small piece of folded paper between the screen and palmrest to keep the lid open.MMC/SD-I've not used this card slot, but I do have a camera with an SD card, so I'm sure the reader will be seeing lots of duty.BATTERY-Yes, the battery is under the laptop's skin and is not intended to be routinely replaced, although it is removable.  Yes, it only lasts 3-5 hours while on battery depending on what you're doing, but for our uses, that lines up exactly with about a day of mixed plugged in and unplugged use so this \"limitation\" isn't really noticed.  Maybe if I was traveling to Europe and kept using the laptop to watch movies or something, THEN I would notice it.  But, like I said, the 3-5 hour battery is actually pretty good for a fully-featured, touchscreen laptop.Fan/Heat-I can hear the fan running most of the time, but it's not bothersome.  Using the laptop on a hardened laptop (literally in my lap) pad, the case has enough circulation from underneath that the case hardley even gets warm.  It's usually cool to the touch, even after hours of use.  With the 7mm Samsung 840 SSD in it, the ONLY thing I hear is the fan (it has no other moving parts).Wireless Card-Some folks put in WiDi / 803.11N card.  I don't need that b/c I don't pass large amounts of data on my network, nor are any of my displays WeDI capable.  So, I can't speed to that, although the HDMI port pushes a nice picture the big screen, and the wireless card (G??) is sufficiently fast for my uses.  I did notice that when installed the Samsung 840 7mm SSD, that the factory wireless card is just RIGHT THERE right out in the open whiel you've got teh back of the case off, so replacing it should be hard.RECAP-Glad I bought it.  Small quirks or lack of high-end features aren't bothersome as you would have to pay big money to overcome them.

Now this laptop is smoking!Still going great with the laptop, plenty of life and horsepower. However, for those that need coolers for the laptop, I'd recommend the Antec USB-powered cooling pad. It is really effective, especially for this laptop due to its build. Lowered my temps as much as 5-10C, so it hits even low 40s or high 30s when idle. Link for those that can't find it:http://www.amazon.com/Antec-Notebook-Cooler-USB-Powered/dp/B0000BVYTV/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1390200892&sr;=8-1&keywords;=antec+cooler+padORIGINAL:For those looking for a slim, lightweight laptop that has touchscreen ability with an affordable price tag, this is one of the few options out there. There are good and fair reviews about this already, and so I will instead summarize what I personally went through in this ultraportable.First of all, I got this from a friend so I did not buy the laptop. I must say overall though I really like it....though there are some significant cons. First the pros.Pros:- Adequate performance for daily multimedia and computing tasks including office work, homework related and youtube tasks. (See cons though for additional info)- Touchscreen. Something that feels so new to me for a laptop, and I have to say it makes Windows 8/8.1 bearable.- For my case, if I do just daily tasks and nothing overly intensive for a long period of time, the laptop remains cool (on the outside).- Casual gaming is doable, but do not expect this to be a gaming machine. In my case, in tweaking with the game settings and resolution, I managed to play games like Mass Effect 1/2/3, Dragon Age, and Diablo III. The Intel HD 4000 has come a long way from its GMA days. Considering though that this is a ULV processor, the HD 4000 doesn't perform as well as the 35 watt Ivy Bridge processors with the same HD 4000.- Nice build and sleek professional look of an ultraportable.- USB 3.0 (albeit only one)- Lack of any heavy bloatware.- Full length keyboard that works well with my somewhat big hands.- Trackpad is responsive, though it does feel a millisecond slow.- Speakers are loud and better compared to what I was used to (Acer, Fujitsu and Toshiba computers from the past)- ULV processor that performs well. This is using the 18 watt Ivy Bridge Core i3 processor, a 3rd generation processor that actually performed almost as well as the 35 watt Core i3 processor of my previous laptop which was 2nd generation Sandy Bridge.Now the cons, and I may be nit-picky but I noticed quite a few people have something related.Cons:- The temperatures of the CPU and GPU in the inside of the computer. When I'm at idle, my temps are 40C-50C just starting out in a normal room temperature area. However, when I do something moderate that takes 40% or so of CPU usage, the CPU temps rise to 60C or even 70C if GPU is being used. Gaming wise, even using a cooler on the bottom of the laptop, temps are high 70C to nearing 90C depending on CPU/GPU usage. These temps don't bother me as much as some people due to the Tjunction rating of 105C for Ivy Bridge ULV cpus. However, constant or increased prolong exposure to such temps can destroy hardware.What I did, however, to ease the potential problems of overheating (and throttling as it can happen around the 90C mark of this CPU) is underclocking it using the battery options under \"Processor Power Management\" in advanced settings. This is only if you are willing to sacrifice some power...but that may be worth it to avoid throttling status. I did personally a 10-20% cut and I still have smooth and workable muscle to do many computing tasks. You can also elevate the laptop up from the bottom so that does not overheat as easily. I use two erasers on the sides to elevate the laptop to a sloped position.There may be other tweaks or ways that can hugely benefit temp issues with marginal sacrifice to power. But the above is what I did to compensate.- Upgrades outside of HDD to SSD is limited if not any. Memory is soldered into the motherboard so 4GB 1333 mhz memory is all you will ever have.-  Screen glare is evident with a glossy finish to the screen, but many laptops have this so it might be a familiar con. Personally it doesn't bother me all that much.- Poor viewing angles of the screen. Not a biggie for me, but can frustrate other people.- Windows 8 may be a con because of the frustration of incompatible programs and/or the cosmetic feel of the laptop (also, no start button). But if you have Windows 8 you can upgrade to 8.1 at this moment which will include the familiar Start button back.- Battery life is pretty poor to say the least. In normal web surfing usage, 3-4 hours is all I got. Add some videos or anything more intensive, and you are looking at 2-3 hours. Do a little gaming will decrease it quite a bit, depending on usages of CPU/GPU. Also charging the laptop may take a while. Going from near 15% to fully charged takes a few hours, more or less if you are using the laptop or not.Remember when you consider the cons, you are buying a relatively cheap touchscreen laptop that is light and small, with adequate muscles to do everything daily if you know how to take care of it. I really love this laptop considering that I came from laptops that are either too big to be classified as ultraportable, or for the 11.6 laptop I used to have it doesn't have enough muscle to do much things outside of basic computing tasks.Overall, I recommend the laptop but do remember that nothing is ever perfect in many things.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great with the touch screen", "Author": "Lee Crockett", "ReviewID": "R35J6D3OPCQF4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price and Windows 8 is so much easier to use with a touch screen.

The touchscreen is awesome, its thin, light and portable, and is built solidly.This ultraportable is very easy to carry anywhere. It is very thin, and also light. It feels like an ultrabook, although it is not because of a lack of an SSD.I love the design. It looks like a $1000 machine, but it costs less than half that! It has a brushed grayish-purple aluminum lid and a silvery metal case where the trackpad and keyboard sit. The touchscreen is the killer feature of this laptop. With Windows 8, my general reccomendation is use it with touch. Since this laptop is cheap and has touch, it allows people to get the advantages of touch without paying a fortune.Windows 8 is really cool. Yeah, they took away the start menu, but the start screen is so much more moder-looking. It's highly customizable, easy to use, and suprisingly fast. Without a touchscreen, the start screen and its apps (known collectively as metro mode) feel clunky and awkward. But the desktop works fine. For people upgrading to 8 from 7, I would say no, because almost all 7 PCs don't have touch. If you like 8, however, a touchscreen PC is a great way to go, and since this machine is super cheap, tons of people can enjoy 8 the way it was meant to be used.For a Core i3 processor, this laptop is actually pretty zippy. I was amazed at how fast it boots up from a shut down. I rarely have any lagging or crashing or anything like that. My use of this laptop is what I would conside everyday. I use Windows Movie Maker frequently, and this laptop works absolutely great with it. Other than that, I check emails, surf the web, and use iTunes to sync iOS devices. I'll occasionally play a casual game like soIitaire or Jetpack Joyride, and I can't say how this machine would work with heavy gaming because I'm not a gamer. I stream music free with xbox music, a great feature in Wndows 8. For listening and watching, the prenstalled music and video apps work great. All this would be considered basic use, and the 4 gbs of RAM and Core i3 really excel at this. I think for most people doing everyday computing, this laptop will shine, and also, because of its price point, I think the majority of people buying this will only be using it for everday use.The keyboard is fantastic, and as an author I use for long periods of time. One of the only cons of this laptop is no backlit keyboard, but I have to keep in mind that this is only a $400 laptop (it feels so much more expensive!). The keys are well spaced, and it offers a comfortable typing experience. The trackpad will sometimes lose track of my finger, but that could probably be fixed with a driver download, and it isn't a big deal, because I'm mostly using the touchscreen. I like how there are no raised buttons, which makes the trackpad feal more high-end. Asus Smart-Gesture makes it easy to use various gestures on the trackpad to perform scrolling and clicks.Overall, this is an EXCELLENT laptop. It's thin and light. It has an awesome brushed aluminum back and a mostly metal case. It performs great for everyday usage. It's highly portable, but is also great for home use. The touchscreen makes Windows 8 amazing and fun to use, and it's highly responsive. This is an absolute perfect PC for anyone doing everyday computing.

I have never used Windows 8 so I was having fun playing around with it when all of the sudden my computer screen went Blue and said it had to restart. I thought it was maybe from updating since the computer was new. So I waited for it to restart and then started playing with it again. Not 6 minutes later the blue screen showed up again and the computer restarted. This continued to happen repeatedly so I called ASUS.I talked to the technician and was told I would have to mail the computer in (at my expense!) to be repaired. The fact that I had to pay the shipping was very surprising to me considering I had only had the computer for less than an hour, and it had come out of the box with the restarting problem. Apparently that is the policy of ASUS.In order to try and avoid the shipping cost, I decided to enlist the help of my computer savvy son who discovered that McAfee Anti-Virus causes the \"blue screen of death\" on some computers because it has problems with Windows 8. He uninstalled the pre-installed McAfee and the problem never occurred again. Hopefully this info will be helpful to someone that might have the same problem. (The store I received my computer from did find a contact from ASUS that I was able to talk to. After a couple of conversations I heard back from them and they offered to send me a shipping label, but the problem was fixed by then.)Now my computer works great - I love it!

I would not recommend this unit for hardcore processing (adobe after affects would run out of memory). However for gaming needs you can get a subscription to Onlive games and get all the new titles there. The Onlive servers render graphics etc so a perfect solution for the budget conscious student as well. Screen can be a little small so I would recommend getting a monitor and extra power adapter for that home location. Memory isn't upgradeable it is soldered on the board. Hard drive is only thing you can upgrade. I would recommend upgrading to an ssd to get a huge jump in performance. You can even get an external housing for the drive it comes with for 20 bucks and turn it into a portable usb drive.  Make sure you get a housing for a 2.5 drive with no external power connection requirements, and you will want one that only uses one usb port. Has touchscreen and that is a MUST for windows 8. If you are in the market and considering a cheaper bigger unit with no touch screen do not do it you will regret it. Windows 8 is hard to navigate with out a touch screen.... well more of a P.I.T.A. But you get the drift.*Update*I am writing this update for all ASUS products as this is not a product specific advisory but it is a technical support advisory. I have deducted 2 stars from this rating that would otherwise be a 5 as all products performance and pricing wise have been 5 star devices. The issue at hand is technical support/consumer service. As we all know no device is worth the components it is made with if you can not get ANY kind of help should you require it.The situation:I purchased an $1,100 phone manufactured by ASUS from an online company that is based in Chicago (the device is a WORLD WIDE phone). I received this VERY EXPENSIVE phone and for a week have had no 4G service. The fastest I get is 2G signal (not satisfactory for this price). I contacted ASUS US technical support today attempting to get some help. The only thing I got was number to call in CHINA as a US version has not been released. I am 20% ok with that answer and here is why. I had an extremely advanced question (I did not expect a resolution but I thought I would ask) and a VERY VERY BASIC question. Basic on the level of this is probably something the FAQ's probably just have not been updated to reflect (How to access the service menu). The technicians should have access to this information through an intranet KB shared via asus corporate servers at the very least. Secondly referring a consumer to make an international support phone call is LUDICROUS this day and age. I was a corporate trainer for a good amount of years and can assure everyone it is VERY possible to route an 800 number call over the internet using an Avaya or equivalent switch to an international location. I know this because we routed calls from the US to the Philippians ALL the time like it was water flowing into a glass...Think about it the next time you call tech support and you obviously are talking to someone international do you think that company is paying anything more than 2 cents for your entire call, if that? They are not so this is just BAD consumer service and support. I will no longer purchase an ASUS product until I can be assured that when the name says ASUS on the box ASUS stands behind it.", "Date": "May 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is the perfect work companion", "Author": "Gus Irizarry", "ReviewID": "R2MRQTO7YT3A3M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After over 5 months of not making up my mind what I wanted, and readings reviews for this and other products, I made up my mind on this Vivobook and could not be happier, It is absolutely perfect, the only quirck it had which I was prepared for was the touchpad not being very good which after using it turned out to be true but this is only a driver issue. After reading numerous reviews talking about putting Samsung Series 5 touchpad drivers in since it uses the same touch pad, I did exactly that and now the touch pad works as it should.I am not going to hash over everything other reviews have said but I'll say this. I have read a bunch of reviews suggesting you upgrade the Wifi card and change the drive to an SSD. I've personally never owned a computer with an SSD but always built my desktops with quick 10,000RPM drives, so I expected this computer to be much slower than I am used to, I am happy to say this computer in most situations is just as responsive as other computers I've owned. In the situations that it is not, its is not that much slower that it would bother me enough to upgrade. As to the Wifi it works perfectly for me as well, no issues of any kind so no need to upgrade the Wifi card for me.The only thing you should worry about is implementing the simple driver solution for the touch pad, once this is done for most uses this is a perfect, flawless device that you can use for work and travel that is easy to carry.  5 stars for me!*UPDATE 3/16/14* - still 5 stars for me. In fact, this is the best 400+ dollars I have ever spend on an electronic device. For entertainment it works for me as well any tablet ever would have, but blows any tablet away in productivity. In fact this is probably the best overall computing device for the money I have ever owned. Just fix it's only quirk which was the touchpad, and this thing rocks. Don't confuse it for a gaming machine, its not.

The automatic disk park problem which caused what was for me a very aggravating constant clicking, which I dealt with by always having to run disapm2, a free download that disables the automatic park.2. I basically like the feel and keyboard and silent somewhat soft and delicate feel of the key-presses, but every now and then don't press down enough and which ends up skipping a letter (or maybe I do press hard enough and it is intermittent variability in the hardware).3. Although I am happy with the quality of the screen, looking at small objects or reading text on browsers, word processors, files, etc. is a somewhat challenging for my ageing eyes. So I can't really say I \"love\" the computer (5 stars)4. Turning off the touch-pad fn-f9 became nonfunctional after a system update or something like that. This is another thing that is very aggravating to me because my palms accidentally contact the touch-pad and the cursor flies off somewhere unattended. From scouring the web I know that this has happened to some other ASUS users. Turns out it appears that downloading/installing the latest Elan touchpad driver seems to have fixed it. But this has happened a couple of times.However I just put in solid state memory (SSD) and viola. With the SSD I rate it 5 stars. A nice plus is that once the screws are off the back case, it pops on and off really nicely like the back of a smartphone.  So as I was working out what I had to do, I could pop the back on and it held pretty firmly without screwing any screws back in. (way easier than back in the day). At first it looked like I was facing a time-consuming nightmare getting the SSD ready to be a system disk recognized by the X202E. But fortunately I found a utility that made it VERY easy (see description of the process below).-------------------------------------------------------------1. Bought a hard drive case (about $10) that converts a SATA drive to have a USB connector.2. Put my SATA solid state drive (SSD) into the hard drive case and connected it to laptop USB port (laptop = ASUS X202E, Windows 8.1)3. Installed and ran \"Paragon Migrate OS to SSD\" which took about 30 minutes to migrate my Windows 8.1 system to the SSD.4. Replaced the original hard disk in the laptop with the SSD.5. The SSD booted right up like lightning - didn't even need to change boot order in BIOS6. Can't tell any difference except the computer is faster.Note: I put the original SATA hard disk into the hard disk case I bought for connecting the SSD to a USB port for migration. I could use it normally as an external hard disk but will keep it as a backup Windows system in case the SSD crashes or becomes dysfunctionalOther reviewer is correct: Paragon Migrate states that it cannot image dynamic drive. But it sure worked great for a standard drive setup. I'm not sure what a dynamic drive refers to but partitionwizard website has a long explanation, which includes this:\"Basic disc and dynamic disc are the two basic hard disk configuration types in Windows System. Most personal computers use basic disks which make the disk management easy. Advanced users and IT administrators may use dynamic disks which are used to improve the performance of computers with several hard disks.\"", "Date": "January 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Bang For The Buck - Gave Away My MBP", "Author": "RICHARD A COLLINS", "ReviewID": "R3VEAF4PN62NRK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In the real world, some purchases disappoint from day one, which is why I have waited one month before submitting this review.

It's only about 2.9 lbs, and although it may not be classified as an ultrabook, it basically is. Its slim and sleek, and overall very aesthetic.Okay, so the battery life has been reported as minimal...but so far its lasted me through the day.

This machine is a replacement for a 4-year-old Toshiba that was my main day-to-day workhorse. That Toshiba, which had a 1.6GHz AMD Athlon Neo Processor and that I had upgraded to 4 GB of RAM and Windows 8 Pro, gave me a reference point for the performance of the new machine (the one reviewed here). My first impression of the VivoBook was that it was SLOWER than the late Toshiba (RIP). This impression persisted through three reboots (always run Windows/Microsoft Update when getting a new computer!). Specifically, it seemed to me that the hard drive was thrashing (jumping all over the place, audibly), that shutdowns and startups were taking abnormally long, installing updates on startup/shutdown took nigh forever (seriously like 45 minutes for a ~600kb update!), and upon boot, the \"shutter\" with the clock that first appears that shields the login screen was initially unresponsive, missing the clock for a few seconds. Naturally, this is unacceptable behavior. A little sleuthing enabled me to find the solution.Asus, like many manufacturers of mobile computing devices, has the sad, sad, sad infatuation with creating \"value-added\" software to differentiate their product. It makes for good marketing, supposedly. The amount of [crud]ware on this machine upon receipt was actually fairly minimal, and some of the utilities looked fairly useful (power management, for example). I therefore skipped my usual habit of automatically uninstalling the included \"value-added\" stuff until I could evaluate the various utilities. For Asus' Windows 7 notebooks, they developed a utility called \"Instant On\". As best I can tell, this utility essentially approximates some of the advanced hibernation/sleep/fast start features of Windows 8, which is understandably an advantage in Windows 7. However, this app comes preinstalled, and this laptop already has Windows 8, therefore the utility replicates native functionality and competes with Windows. I can only conclude that the thrashing I noted on startup and shutdown was Windows and the Asus utility competing to save state (think of it like a savegame for Windows). Uninstalling the \"Instant On\" utility immediately resolved the problem. If they ever offer a Microsoft Signature (meaning vanilla Windows) version of this machine - get it and save yourself the trouble.I will not judge the machine itself based on the junk software that came preinstalled, since this is sadly standard practice in the computing and mobile industry. First, the main body is a brushed metal, mostly machined to shape and fairly rigid. It does not show fingerprints, though I noticed a minor burr on the finish that I was able to remove with a fingernail. The outer shell on the screen is a similar material, but not as deeply brushed, so it is much more prone to showing fingerprints (still nowhere near as bad as glossy plastic). The keyboard is responsive (I have found typing on the chiclets to be no problem), but it is not backlit so working at night is a little more difficult (minor complaint).The touch screen is responsive; however, there seems to be high resistance between the glass and the finger you use. I am not sure if there is a manufacturing film/oil on the glass, or if such a coating is missing and it should be there, but either way, the effect seems to fade with time (as the glass collects skin oils? Ew).Performance is as expected for a Core i3 and 4GB of RAM with a traditional platter HDD. It runs cooler than my old Toshiba, but significantly warmer than my girlfriend's Acer V5 Touch. This machine uses Intel integrated graphics, so do not expect to have an enjoyable experience playing Crysis on this thing. The graphics are more than powerful enough to handle Office, Windows, and even the new SimCity at low settings (if you can log in!).Final verdict: This is a fairly robust machine, well built, and one of the best (only) options in this size.

Luckily, ASUS has 1-year- accidental warranty so you only have to put up with the dents and scratches.As you do your research, you probably will find out that there are 2 versions of this notebook, Q200E and X202E.

This little laptop is awesome! I'm coming off of a SONY VAIO so to be honest I didn't know if there would be much of a difference between the i5 and i3 processors and I was a bit nervous. But this laptop works beautifully. The track pad and touch screen are both very responsive. The webcam is awesome as well! I like to video chat a ton and I will be going abroad so the webcam was a big deal for me. The design is very slick. Very sturdy outer Shell (feels like a mac). I really like that word check comes automatic with anything your typing. As type right now any word that's spelled wrong is underlined! I love that because now I don't have to worry about spelling when filling out online applications! I've only had this baby for a day and I've used it quite a bit but we'll see how she is in a month or so!One kind of con I have about at the moment is the keys. The keyboard is awesome about the spacing and the keys feel sturdy but the texture of them is a bit cheap if that makes any sense. Of course this isn't much of a draw back for me sense the price is amazing!Also for the people that are ify about Windows 8. I will let you know that I am a windows fan and I have had both mac and pcs... I just think windows is more practical but when they came out with windows 8 I absolutely hated it. I thought it was the most impractical thing windows has done. I did not upgrade with my VAIO even though my internship told me to do so. I just really didn't like windows 8. Now that I am forced to have it. I will say that windows 8 works like a dream with touchscreens! (that rhymed ;) I like how its set up to go through and customize the colors to begin with. I'm still going through customizing but as of right now I enjoy the flexibility with it. I also can switch to desktop mode and pan between screens!Anyhow, bottom line. As of right now I like my ASUS, and that's a big deal coming from a college student that has to switch laptops mid semester. A very picky student at that as well.

I ordered the Samsung 840 Pro SSD 256GB and cloned the 500GB that came with the Vivo book.  Everyone should do that.  Samsung makes that easy with the supplied duplication software. I didn't do a fresh install. That would be too hard. I just cloned the disk and it worked perfectly.2.  I ordered the Targus USB 3.0 dual video docking station.  FYI Targus says they don't make a power tip for the Vivobook yet, so I can't use it to power the Vivobook when docked.  But the USB 3.0 is superfast and handles the video, wired ethernet, and all the devices just fine.3. I wish you can upgrade the memory to 8GB, but all indications are the bottleneck in this system is the graphics subsystem.Since installing the SSD, this thing is spooky fast.

I considered a Mac but was constrained by some of the Windows-only applications I use. It didn't make any sense to do a Mac dual-boot arrangement since people typically buy Macs because they like OS X, not Windows. Also, while I had successfully resisted Windows 8 I finally realized I needed to stay technologically current.A few months ago I found the Asus X202e at a local Microcenter for $499 and took the plunge.  At that price, why not? My experience with the machine has been nothing but positive. It is small and relatively light-weight but has a solid feel and good build quality. It attaches to classroom media interfaces without a hitch and smoothly runs all the programs I need for my instruction (PowerPoint, statistical packages). Further, and at the risk of severe censure, I like Windows 8. As would be expected, there was a bit of a learning curve but it wasn't as steep as I thought it would be. I have not taken full advantage of the touchscreen but plan to work that into my workflow as need be.As a side note, I also do some ballroom dance djing. It turns out that the X202e is a handy little music-playing platform. I use a free dj program called VirtualDJ that has a fairly complicated and graphically demanding interface (at least it seems so). I also use iTunes. In either case, the X202e plays songs with ease and with good quality. While I typically don't 'scratch' while playing songs, the touch screen can be used to create effects and might be of use to more advanced djs.  Its size and weight are also benefits when packing up or setting up a sound system.In summary, this little computer is an excellent value. In fact, much to my irritation, Microcenter was selling them for $399 over the holiday and now sells them for $449. At this price, you have a bargain.A quick update - I decided to follow recommendations to replace the original hard drive with a Samsung SSD. I got a good buy on Amazon for a Samsung 840EVO 250GB.

After first turning it on, the laptop went through the standard Windows 8 setup.  The touchpad worked fine and I was delighted to find that two-finger scrolling on the touchpad worked great.  Two-finger scrolling can be very convenient for those times when it's not as comfortable to scroll by touching the screen and when your fingers are on the touchpad anyway.  As well, the touchpad wasn't overly sensitive, so it did not interfere as I was typing on the keyboard.But then I started getting automatic updates from Asus.  Many of them.  I would have to restart the computer and wait several minutes for everything to install.  This happened three times and after the third time, two-finger scrolling no longer worked and the touchpad was overly sensitive to the point where I could barely type a sentence without something wacky happening due to the interference from my palm being close to the touchpad as I typed away.Also, I was video chatting with my friend when the video feed started behaving erratically, which never used to happen when I used my old laptop to video chat.Keyboard felt kind of cramped, but one can get used to it.  The core i3 processor can make things lag a bit when you have several tabs open and a video chat going at the same time.  Fan seems to be on constantly.  Again, no biggie, one can get used to it.  Touchscreen worked great, and I loved the small form factor, and small weight.Due to all of the above (but especially due to the badly updated Asus touchpad driver), I decided to return the laptop.  For some reason, neither Amazon's nor Tigerdirect's website had any record of the transaction, so I had to call Tigerdirect for instructions on how to return the laptop.  I was on hold for about half an hour before I finally spoke to someone.  He told me I needed to call Asus to get a case number and then call back Tigerdirect to get an Return Authorization Number so that I could return the laptop.  Of course, I had to wait another half hour to speak to someone from Tigerdirect.  In the end, I paid $21 to ship the laptop back to them.So the lesson is: Try to buy the Vivobook directly from the Microsoft Store if you can.  My friend got her Vivobook from the MS Store and it has absolutely no issues, no series of Asus updates forced upon you, and no bloatware.  Sure, you'll pay a bit more (last time I checked, the MS Store had it for $499), but it's worth it.", "Date": "March 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, if you add an SSD", "Author": "Alex McCool", "ReviewID": "RAJBN8AKJ0IGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "On the outside, this is a stylish looking laptop, with the shiny lid and chiclet keyboard.  The screen is somewhat small compared to the overall size, but this is helpful for Windows 8 gestures.  The 768p display is fine for the screen size. Any higher resolution would make touching Windows 7 programs challenging.  It is a little thicker than I expected, but still less than 1\" in all locations.  It weighs about 3 pounds, heavier than I expected, but still very light.  The back panel is easily removable with a regular precision phillips screwdriver.  This exposes the removable hard drive, wifi card, and battery.  The keyboard is slightly small, and were my (average size) hands any bigger, I would have trouble typing.  The touchpad is pretty bad with stock drivers, and acceptable with an aftermarket driver (link in the comments).  I also have an external DVD burner so that was never an issue for me.  I like having an HDMI port to be able to stream on the big screen TV.  The power cable could be slightly longer.  Battery life is around 4 hours the way I use it- max brightness web browsing.  The screen is slightly dimmer than the average laptop.  My first Windows 8 experience was on a computer with no touchscreen.  I hated it- nothing seemed logical and it was a big downgrade from Windows 7.  After returning that laptop for this one, a touchscreen has made me love Windows 8.  Still, it was very slow.  For years, I have been a SSD user.  This was my first hard drive in years, and when I first booted up the computer and played with it, it was very slow.  It booted in no less than 30 seconds.  Apps take up to 10 seconds to load, and installations take 5+ minutes.  The initial run of Windows Updates that happen on boot/shutdown took up to 30 minutes to shut down the computer.  So naturally, the first thing I did was attempt my SSD install.  It took me a day of fiddling, but I now have it working and WOW.  It is night and day difference.  If you do not have an SSD in this computer, I cannot recommend it.  It will be more an exercise in patience than a fun new touch experience.  Luckily, I had a leftover SSD laying around and I installed it (will discuss install at bottom).  Now this computer is fun and peppy.  If you do not intend to install an SSD as soon as you purchase this computer, then do not purchase it.  With an SSD, you will love it.  Other than that, the power of the computer is fine.  If you plan to do intense video rendering or play video games on Ultra graphics with 60FPS, then this isn't for you.  I haven't maxed out the 4GB of RAM with a variety of apps open, but I stay in the desktop app most of the time.  I was a little wary of the 1.8GHz processor, but I haven't felt bogged down web browsing or playing oldschool games.  You can go into BIOS and increase the video ram to 512MB as well.  This will even play Skyrim on the lowest graphics settings.  If you are going to use this for web browsing, Microsoft Office document editing, and other basic use, this is all the power you will ever need.  Now I will discuss my experience with the SSD install, since I see lots of people having issues in other reviews.  The factory hard drive is a SATA 3Gb/s drive.  I had an Intel 320 80GB SSD (also SATA 3Gb/s) laying around, so I used it.  I have read on some websites that it is a SATA 6Gb/s port, but I cannot comment, since I did not install one.  I first attempted to use the Windows 7 File Recovery (Control Panel > File History > Windows 7 File History link in the bottom left) along with the Windows recovery disk.  I created a system image on the SSD via USB port and then installed it.  The computer would not boot past BIOS, regardless of what settings I changed or what keys I deleted.  Then, I found Macrium Reflect (link in the first comment), reformatted the SSD and created a clone of all partitions on the factory hard drive except for the one labeled DATA (it was empty).  Macrium Reflect automatically resized the system (C:) partition to fill the majority of the space on the SSD.  Then, I installed the SSD again.  This time, it booted up perfectly without changing any BIOS settings.  Windows 8 automatically recognized it as an SSD and optimized it as such.  Almost 30GB are used by the OS and associated files.  I also removed the ASUS Smart Gesture program and installed the Elan touchpad drivers (link in the first comment).  It still isn't perfect, I'd like to be able to reverse the direction of scrolling, but it's usable now.

However, it even runs Civ5 with touchscreen. Not too bad.My only problem (really) is the SLOOW charging. 1.75A charger. What the...? Even ipads have 2.1A chargers.On the plus side, the battery life is good, averaging at 5 hours for light use.One thing, though. I replaced the HDD with my Intel 310 (80gig) SSD. Much better now, although once booted, the HDD was just fine for my needs, too.Edit 2012/12/17In order to get better battery life, I looked up how to enable Device Initiated Power Management on the SSD, found this. It worked. I get better longevity when typing. It does not do much while surfing the internet, though, since the SSD is constantly in use, and has little time to power down.

When my Toshiba died after 4 years of faithful use, I decided to buy this computer because I wanted something newer, rather than fixing up the Toshiba.This machine seemed good, but it has been a nightmare.First, please try it out in the store.  The keyboard keys are awful and I don't have large hands.  Mis-typing will be a something you do on a constant basis, as the key separation requires you to alter your typing.  My Thinkpad I use for work (an old T400) is MUCH better.Point 1.5: The screen is not lit.  Good luck in darkened places.Secondly, the machine frequently crashes.  i don't know why that happens.  But it is a major annoyance.  It looks like the processor is not powerful enough to run Windows 8.Thirdly, Windows 8 sucks.  Touching the touchpad causes the zoom to go in and out.  I use the desktop mode (I hate Metro Tiles) and it will randomly switch to Metro mode.  It feels like it is possessed.  I much prefer the old Windows (and I have a Windows Mobile device!) and it took me 15 minutes and a youtube video tutorial to find out things as simple as finding Chkdsk or Defrag.  I hate Vista and XP, but I prefer it to W8.Fourthly, it does not have a CD ROM drive.  Part of the price you pay of a small design.  So software you purchase needs to be bought electronically or you need to buy an external CD Rom drive (budget it in!)  For me, no problem except.....Finally, the hard drive crashed.  I can hear it rattling inside.  Never shook, dropped or even scratched the unit.  No viruses.  And now after 5 months of use, it won't work.  About $100 worth of software is useless.  And it will now cost me to buy the packaging, ship the device, wait 2 weeks for it to be fixed and then they will charge me for Shock proof packaging to ship back (says so on their website).So, I paid $424 for this device, but in actually, it will cost me closer to $550.

The apps in the Microsoft store are awesome. Windows 8 itself has a good deal of programs built in, but it's nice to be able to download others such as games and planners, etc. My favorite app is Netflix, actually, most shows and movies on there only work in the app.The touchscreen was just a bonus when I got it, but I have grown to love it. You use the laptop completely differently by simply being able to touch the screen. The screen doesn't mark easily, and you can either use the microfiber cloth that comes with it, or even just a kleenex will clean it well.For school, this laptop is great. It's small enough that it fits easily into my backpack (it's much smaller than a lot of my textbooks). I have the newest version of Office (2013), so it all works well together. I would suggest getting that version if you have to buy one anyway because it is formatted to work with Windows 8, and a touchscreen. It's been a lot of fun to play around with a program I already knew so well like Word, but with the ability to use the touchscreen.The battery life is pretty good. The fastest the battery dies for me is about 4-5 hours, and that's when I'm running Netflix. Just normal functions (Word, Pandora, etc) last about 7-8 hours. It lasts long enough for a full day at the library.The only problems I have had are with apps not responding (which usually has to do with my wifi). Or sometimes the touchscreen is delayed,  but that only happens when I am running a lot of apps at once.Bonus: you can get a snap on cover for them (I don't have the pink, mines silver).

I paid about $150 less than most people because I purchased this laptop through my University's bookstore.  They were selling for only $349.99 because I received an instant education rebate.  So I may be biased already because for $350 it is a great little notebook.  It is fast, stylish, lightweight, and the cost is obviously awesome.  I had been saving up for 6 months for a MacBook Air and I still don't have enough (I'm a student!!!) so when I saw this I figured I would try it out.  It's a fraction of the price and it seemed to have all the features I really needed (Plus a TOUCHSCREEN!!).I didn't expect to like it so much, but Windows 8 is actually an impressive operating system.  It is very intuitive and gives you the illusion of having a tablet and laptop in one.  I really enjoy being able to download apps and be able to use the desktop feature as well.  So when I just want to browse the internet I can use the touchscreen and the app home screen but when I need a fully functioning laptop I can switch to desktop mode with a swipe or a touch. I also like that it is light and thin.  I can stick it in a purse and take it with me anywhere.  That is a big selling point for me because I am in grad school and sometimes I need to take my computer with me to school or the library and having something this convenient is great.People have mentioned the hard drive issues however I haven't experienced that yet (fingers crossed).  I have an external hard drive with 500 GB already and I intend to use that to backup my documents.  I also have everything backed up in dropbox and skydrive (which is a cloud service that is already installed on the laptop.).  I figure as long as it is covered by the warranty and ASUS will replace it I don't mind a few quirks every now and then.  I will just hope that it isn't an issue and if it ever becomes a problem at least I know my documents won't be lost and ASUS will repair it.I guess what I am saying is that you get what you pay for.  Sure a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro is a great computer!  But it will also cost you upwards of $1200 depending on the model and additions you make.  So for $350 or $500 (depending on what you paid for it) this ASUS is a great alternative; especially for those of us who don't have the resources to spend on the highest quality product available.", "Date": "June 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "BUYER BEWARE.

Gesture support is reasonable, but it's difficult to click the mouse buttons without moving the cursor first (which makes click-and-drag type operations painful), and about one time in four it will not pick up a two-fingered tap as a right mouse click.

We're talking a device with full Windows 8 that in addition to the Windows store apps runs real Windows XP/Vista/7 applications, not the gimped Surface with the gimped Windows RT OS that is not compatible with the old programs. We're talking a touchscreen laptop to make use of the touch capabilities of the new OS, not some lame Windows 8 ultrabook without touch. We're talking a device with an Intel Ivy bridge, core i3 processor that smokes, not a gimmicky tablet with a slow, cheapo Atom processor recycled from a 2 year old netbook.The other devices that match the Vivobook cost twice or three times as much (e.g Lenovo Yoga 13, Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro, Sony Vaio Duo 11). These other options cost so much more because they include luxury items like core i5 or i7 processors, solid state HDDs, and digitizer pens that aren't needed unless you're a hardcore gamer, or graphics designer. There are a few Windows 8 tablets such as the Acer Iconia and Lenovo Thinkpad 2 that have equal or lesser specs than the Vivobook but cost hundreds more simply because they are tablets and people will pay a premium for them. And as previously mentioned, the heavily hyped Surface is inferior in hardware and OS to the Vivobook, yet also costs much more because of the novelty of being a hybrid tablet device. So don't fall for the hype! Don't overspend! For those who want all the essentials, but do not have an extra $500-$1000 to burn, the clear and sensible choice is easily the Vivobook.", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty Satisfying", "Author": "Kim", "ReviewID": "R129GVX12IJHST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Have had my laptop now for a little under a month.

First and for most, I want to express how much I love my new laptop. The metal cover on the lap top gives it a sleek, high tech, fancy look which takes the attention away from the 'unknown' asus brand. The laptop gives it an additional glamour and for the affordable price of under 500 bucks, why not? I love how thin it is. I am currently a nursing student and I have tons of books I have to carry with me, but with this thin design, it's one less thing I have to worry about. I am a small guy, and so the keyboard isn't a hassle either. I feel comfortable typing away on my lap top because it doesn't feel like I am playing the piano when I am writing a long ass report. The music is loud enough and clear enough so I can take it anywhere and play my music without having a poor quality sound. The contrast color on the screen isn't bad either, I just wish it were a little brighter sometimes. The cons? Compared to my 10 year old MacBook, it takes a long ass time to load some programs. It's only day three since I've had this laptop and my computer already froze on me a couple of times. Perhaps it's windows, IDK...but I am not too impressed typing away using the touch screen either so there have been some times when I have to still use a mouse because it's faster. The camera on this thing borderline sucks. I won't be using it anytime to take pictures and the whole touch screen idea gets old pretty quickly. Overall though,  I totally love this lap top. the pros outweighs the cons and for the price I paid for it, I recommend it.

To be honest, I was taking a chance of getting the 11.6\" version instead of the 14\" version as the latter at least comes with a MSata harddisk (24GB SSD + 500GB HDD) while the former only comes with 500GB HDD. I was actually thought of upgrading the HDD to SSD as soon as I laid my hands on it as my PC and all of my notebooks are using SSD. I bought the latest 256GB SSD Harddisk from Plextor (model: M5 Pro) and immediately put it into action after cloning it with the freeware, EaseUS ToDo Home edition. That's where all hell broke lose.First of all, never use the free cloning software that comes with the Plextor SSD Harddisk as it will somehow cause the notebook to boot into Bios perpectually. Even after cloning with EaseUS ToDo freeware, the notebook doesn't recognize the SSD HDD at all. I followed the tips in this thread to disable FastBoot and Secured Booting. It works but kept getting erratic performances like, internet explorer hanged, system freeze, reboot automatically, and many more. I was very disappointed because I noticed the Bios seems to have problem registering the new SSD HDD. Took me couple of days until I managed to downloaded the latest BIOS version 206. The version that came with my notebook was 202. I flashed my notebook with Bios ver 206 and viola ! Seems like all problems fixed. The notebook now can recognize my Plextor SSD HDD.Boot time slashed from about a min to 10 secs flat. Of course, not to mention, other applications open and close in a jiffy. The overall performance improves significantly. For those who doesn't like to flash bios, you can use Intel SSD HDD. When I was stuck (before flashing to ver 206 bios), I popped in my old 128GB Intel SSD HDD (I think its model is 320), it works without problem. I guess it is because the notebook is using Intel Chipset and thus, no compatibility issues.COnclusion: The stock version of the notebook is okay in terms of value for money but, the overall performance is below par perhaps, due to the stock 500GB HDD.

It has taken a little more time to get used to than computer purchases I have made in the past, but overall I like it.  I needed/wanted a new small laptop because my old netbook had Windows XP for an operating system.The 11.6\" screen size is just perfect for a travel computer.  The 10\" screen size on my old netbook was a little too small.  I love the keyboard on this new ASUS.  It's a good size and I enjoy the feel of the chiclet-style keys.  I also like the touchpad on this computer more that I have liked touchpads on my previous laptops.  I have not found it to be overly sensitive and I'm not performing spurious actions while typing.  I prefer a mouse, though, so I'm sticking to a mouse where it's convenient.I'm very glad to have the RJ45 ethernet port, which seems to be becoming a rarity.  Updating the system goes faster when I use the wired internet connection.I have had no problem with the wireless connection so far, although my router at home is an older one that lacks wireless n capability.  I'll get a new dual band router when I get around to getting a smart TV.I have had the computer freeze up on me a couple of times.  The screen would tell me that Windows was being configured and then, at 100% configuration, nothing would happen.  I thought I had a lemon on my hands, but I eventually realized that I had been causing forced shutdowns.  One time was when I pulled the laptop toward me on my bed; I think I may have put my thumb on the power button.  I've purchased a small chill pad to place the laptop on while it's on my bed, and I now reposition the computer using the chill pad.  Another forced shutdown was caused when I pulled the top of the screen toward me.  Now that I'm being more careful to not cause a forced shutdown, I'm having no problem.  I will update this review if I do.  I hope this comment will help someone else; it probably makes me sound lame, but whatever.Like many reviewers, I dislike Windows 8.  Someone advised me to download and install Classic Shell, and I'm so grateful they did.  It has made Windows 8 appear a lot more like Windows 7 by giving me back the Windows 7 start menu and Windows explorer.  I haven't yet discovered all that Classic Shell can do.  I upgraded to Windows 8.1 [edit: this is done from a tile on the Windows 8 start screen], and I like that active programs now appear in my task bar, so that I can easily shut them down before I turn off the computer.I'd like to thank other reviewers of this laptop.  I have yet to try several of the tips, but I intend to keep referring back to the reviews as I become more accustomed to this new purchase.Edit 6-8-2014:  I have adjusted the display as recommended by p knight and other reviewers.Edit 6-8-2014:  I read the reviews complaining of hard drive failures and decided to upgrade to an SSD.  This turned out to be more complicated than I expected.  I purchased a 120 GB Sandisk SSD (about $80) and a USB 3 enclosure (about $20).  I downloaded a trial version of Macrium Reflect software as recommended by some of the more helpful Amazon reviews.  When I attempted to clone the hard drive to the SSD that I had installed in the enclosure, I got an error message from Reflect that suggested an incompatibility of sector sizes between this computer and the SSD.  A knowledge base article on Macrium's web site suggested that the incompatibility was due to certain enclosures \"faking\" sector sizes of 4086 bytes, which is incompatible with this computer's sector size of 512 bytes.  This caused me to give the enclosure a negative review, which I have since deleted.  I ordered a different enclosure, but had the same result.  A friend then downloaded Acronis True Image software, and this time we were able to successfully clone the HDD to the new SSD.  Now the SSD is in the computer and there's a noticeable increase in speed!  I'm very glad to have made the upgrade.Final 6-8-2014 edit: I'm coming to love this touch screen. I've just added a star to the review.  I feel that even with the SSD upgrade, I got a good deal. I'm even starting to get used to Windows 8.1.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "A touch screen that really works!", "Author": "Daveofalltrades", "ReviewID": "R2EH5DRRX8T2DK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop for work as a diagnostic tool.

I am so spoiled by the touchscreen that I find myself putting fingerprints on all my devices!  The computer has been acceptably fast and very stable and dependable. I especially like the 2 second wake up from sleep. The only issue I can foresee is that I have to plug in a USB device almost every time I use the laptop, and one of the three ports seems to be developing a problem with connectivity after 11 months of use.

She had a limited budget as she is on a fixed income.I was familiar with the Asus X202E because my daughter bought one for use at college this spring. She is a bit tough on her electronics and the Asus X202E has held up very well for her.This computer is perfect for my Mom's needs. She can easily use it anywhere in her house and does not have to worry about having a separate stand to support the computer when she is using it. It has reasonable battery life so she does not need to be tethered to an outlet. It has plenty of processing power for her usage and it even does a nice job of streaming video. The display is crisp and responsive. The keyboard is laid out well and fits her hands.There are two small issues that we ran into. For some reason the computer got locked up when doing the initial Windows Update. It turns out that something was corrupted in the Windows Updater. I had to contact Asus Customer Service for instructions on how to reload Windows. The Service team was very helpful and we got the issue sorted out very quickly. Not sure if this was an Asus problem or a Windows 8 issue. The other small aggravation is that the touchpad buttons need to be depressed for a longer time than I am accustomed to in order for them to work. I have heard that there are some different touchpad drivers that can be downloaded, but I have not had a chance to check into that yet.Mom did not like the Start screen so I installed Classic Shell to boot directly to the desktop and give her a start button so she did not have to completely re-learn the windows UI. I also dumped the included MacAfee security software in favor of a freeware solution so she would not get held hostage by a subscription fee down the road and lose her security protection.All in all, both my Mom and I are very pleased with the purchase and recommend this computer to others with similar needs. I think it is an excellent solution for senior citizens and also college students.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "keyboard and mouse VERY poor", "Author": "Disciple", "ReviewID": "R2P5KKWH3QMGYW", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Hate Windows 8!

This little notebook rocks with Ubuntu installed. I left Win 8 installed just in case I need it for something. I plan to upgrade to SSD eventually and have a dual band wifi card on the way. So far the only complaint I have is battery life. I need to keep that in mind when going mobile.Having a touch screen notebook is special. I have a tablet so am used to the touch screen. All in all this is a great notebook if you can stand the 4 hours battery life. I did crack it open, the battery looks replaceable but special too. Not sure yet what a replacement would cost.UPDATE-July 4th 2013.1. Intel 6235 wireless BT card installed2. SSD Samsung 840 Pro installed3. Dual boot win 8 and Ubuntu 13.04Pros: Now have dual band wirelessBoot time is incredible, real fast almost unbelievable!Cons: Bluetooth setup for this Intel 6235 wireless card is difficult. After installed Bluetooth will not pair. I did fix however!Ubuntu works flawlessly as soon as you boot with the new Intel card, Win 8 is a real headache as all Windows systems are. The fix is long and drug out but here are the basic clues for success:1. Uninstall the Atheros wireless and Bluetooth selecting remove driver, do this in device manager. Power down but previously download the two drivers you will need for the new Intel 6235 card, BT_2.6.1212_e64, and Wireless_15.8.0_De64. Bootup and Install both drivers I did BT first.2. Clue-Reverse the antenna wires on the actual card, I had best results with wires reversed.3. After installing new drivers, look in \"services\", disable Zatheros service. If you uninstalled Atheros correctly there should not be any other service running related to Atheros wireless or Bluetooth.4. Open device manager and go through all devices looking for anything Atheros related to wireless and Bluetooth. Disable them all. The hardest Atheros BT driver to find was in \"system devices\" With this driver left enabled BT works but only after a hard reboot, disable it and BT will work much better. Do not disable the Ethernet network Atheros it is still needed for the hard wire Ethernet feature this notebook has.Final Comments:The Atheros uninstall does not uninstall all the system drivers. The reason Intel BT driver fails is due to the fight between Atheros leftover drivers. Once all Atheros drivers and services are disabled the new Intel card works great.SSD: The Samsung 840 pro SSD came with a nice clone program. I used it to transfer my HD to the SSD. You will need to somehow connect the new SSD drive via USB to do the clone. I have a Thermaltake hot swap hard drive dock. There are a few ways to connect a SSD or laptop hard drive to USB. I guess if this is hard for you then probably doing any upgrades should be left to a knowledgeable PC tech. I hope this helps someone. I searched and never found a solution to the BT issue so here it is for you to use.

Like some other reviews have mentioned, make sure to get a 7.5mm SSD, otherwise it won't fit properly. The SSD upgrade will not only make the system considerably faster; it will also improve your battery life and cut down on noise (mechanical HDDs have moving parts---SSDs don't)I also recommend switching out the thermal paste (careful---this will void your warranty). This can help a lot with temps. Note that there's an orange square sticker with a hole in the middle over the CPU---I assumed this served no purpose other than to keep the thermal paste from overspilling. This shouldn't be a problem if you're using a non-conductive thermal paste, so I went ahead and removed it. If you're using Arctic Silver 5 or another conductive TIM, you might want to exercise more caution, since this CPU doesn't have a heat spreader.There are a lot of different methods for applying thermal paste. You'll have to do some research and decide which one to use. Just make sure you don't use too much---that can actually make the CPU run hotter.Speaking of heat, the CPU fan in this laptop is absolutely dreadful. It's not loud by any means, but it allows the laptop to idle at up to 80 degrees Celsius before it starts spinning any faster. If you ask me, I'd prefer a cool laptop to a quiet one. If you ask me, they should've used a totally different design for the fan (can't even call it a heatsink). It's literally just a flat piece of metal with a fan on it. With a proper heatsink, this CPU would run a lot cooler and wouldn't throttle nearly as much. It's possible for ASUS to fix this with a BIOS update, but they haven't done it yet.Be sure you have a good set of screwdrivers, unlike myself. All the screws are overtightened at the factory and they can be nearly impossible to get out with a screwdriver that is worn or incorrectly sized.I got this laptop on eBay for just over $300, and I got a 256gb Samsung 830 for $150---so for just $450, I now have a laptop that's about 80% as capable as a $1000 ultrabook. That's why this thing gets four stars. If you like to tinker and you're prepared to add an SSD, this PC is definitely worth getting used.

It's not as bad as my B23E, but no way near well behaved as, say, my t101mt or 1008HA. I have discovered that the random jumping is reduced by using only one hand to operate the touchpad (no clicking with the left while scrolling with the right), but am about to install the free toughpad blocker utility.  This is the first Asus machine I've had where I felt the keyboard itself was inconsistently responsive.  Too many keystrokes that don't register and a Ctrl-v combination that requires considerable pressure on the left Ctrl key, but not (yet?) enough for me to take off a star or send the machine in for service.* The battery is not replaceable by the user. The typical user would have to send it in for service in a couple of years. By then, it may be obsolete, tho'. However, it's the kind of machine that can grow on you, so you might find yourself doing it for sentimental reasons and then wondering why you gave in, as I did with my 1008HA.", "Date": "June 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "great touchscreen", "Author": "bob b.", "ReviewID": "RRW8NAPP9A8B5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Product has exceeded expectations.

It will not play Call of Duty of course, but it handles Microsoft office, web use, and e-mail very well.  It took a little while to get used to Windows 8, but now I really like it on this laptop.  Windows 8 needs a touch screen to get the most out of it.  It's easy to go from the New interface to the desktop.  Windows apps are run from the new interface, Windows programs are run from the desktop, just like in Windows 7.  It took a couple of weeks to get to know the new operating system.  From the desktop it acts just like Windows 7.

The programs load and respond with no delay.  The core i3 3rd generation ivy bridge is powerful enough to run all the apps and programs.  It handles photo editing well, I have Corel paintshop pro X4, for heavy editing and a photo app for light editing.  Mail, Facebook, Twitter and Netflix all have apps.  I can watch 2 netflix movies on a single charge, (I didn't run the battery down to see how long it really lasts).  The search function is nice, just start typing.  It will search for folders, programs, apps, inside documents, and on the web.  Just choose which one you want searched.I can't review the touch pad.  I hate touch pads don't use them if something else is available.  I didn't notice any CPU \"whine\", but the fan is audible, but not that loud.  The graphics aren't 1080P, but they're still good.

Recognizing the importance of all the people that helped me to make decisions by reading a review when I buy at Amazon, I am writing my first one. I am not a computer expert, I am a user that has enough knowledge to use a computer and fix most issues. After researching the few reviews available, and because of the good price and size, I bougth this laptop for traveling. I had a small old Lenovo and It was giving me problems. So I got this one as my Christmas gift. The problems began when I was trying to transfer my files. It has 3 partitions in the hard drive and a friend of mine, that was helping me to set up the laptop, could not transfer all my music from Itunes. Win 8 was new and we did not know if it was the ASUS problem or Win 8 problem and how to combine 2 partitions. To learn Win 8 took me a bit and meanwhile I was using the desktop that runs as a Win 7. The keyboard on the screen is very nice and I loved the the touch screen. The problem was to figure  what link should be touched to open and which one should be opened with the keyboard. The touch screen is not in all the screen like the iPad. Then it took me forever to get a cd drive to work with it. I bought and I returned several. Finally I used it in the first trip and the battery was not enough for a 3 hours plane trip. I blamed on my ignorance of win 8 and the set ups. I kept using to learn win 8. I was happy with the new toy, but I started to find the inconveniences. To use it as a tablet is great idea, but the keyboard is in between you and the screen. If I had one that I could twist or flip the keyboard it would be much better. It is an Useless screen keyboard if you the keyboard is in between you and the screen. Then I eventually went back to my HP, and set it aside just for traveling. One morning I decided to use it, I was in the middle of a CE credit online class and a message came saying it was going to shut down. I tried to stop it and it was impossible. This was the end of my affair with ASUS. It would not load win 8 or any thing else. Next day I took it to OfficeMax, thinking it was a software problem. They researched online, they called several technicians and they could not figure it out. I called Adorama Camera, that sold it to me here on Amazon and it was after 90 days, I got it in December. I could not return it. I took to Best Buy and they had it for 2 weeks, then they told me the hard drive died. Best Buy tried to send it to ASUS and they couldn't because I did not buy it on Best Buy. I called myself ASUS and they told me to send to them but back up my files first. How ? I could not do it if the machine does not come up! Took it back to Best Buy and I had to pay Best Buy to do it and buy an external hard drive. It cost me to diagnose it, to back up my files, for the hard drive and to ship to ASUS. They don't send a box just a RA. The machine is now with ASUS and I am waiting for it to come back. I have a trip coming up and I decided to get another laptop. I am going back to the Lenovo brand. All the technicians told me the same. I will sell the ASUS on Craigslist.  I did not get a warranty from Amazon. It was not offered and it was a not an expensive machine I thought it would be OK just with the 1 year manufacturer  warranty. Bad choice. Who knows when it  will come back and if they will fixed it. I am not confident anymore. Bad luck or a bad machine, I don't know.  I have to start from scratch with all the transfers and installations again. Besides, I lost all my CE answers and if  I have to do it all over I will do it in a new laptop. Now  I know all I need in a touch screen win 8 laptop. By the way, I took my old Lenovo to be checked and it cost me $40 to change the RAM memory that was making the machine turn off all the time. It is working great again.Boooo to ASUS, Booo to Adorama Camera and BOOOOOO to myself for my bad choice.

It says they reloaded the operating system and replaced the touchpad hardware.So I have to send it in again and go without a laptop (the only computer in the house currently) for another week or so.I think you get a few bad lemons regardless of brand/manufacturer/OSBUTI would NOT recommend this item. And if I could exchange it for a different laptop right now I certainly would. And I probably won't buy ASUS again even though I know they are considered to be one of the higher end brands.UPDATE (5/7/2013)So I bought this laptop back in November of 2012 and used it for two months with no issues. Then the multitouch function on the touchpad went out. Normally not a big deal but with Windows 8 I had gotten used to using it for things and it became annoying not to have it. Restarting the computer always made it work again, but it would go out after a few hours, days, or even weeks depending. Eventually I called ASUS and they recommended a restore to factory settings which I did. This did not resolve the issue. They had me mail it in, which I did. They replaced the touchpad, but this did not resolve the issue. They then had me uninstall and reinstall drivers. Which I did. This did not resolve the issue. They then had me mail it in again, which I did, and all they did was replace the touch pad again, which didn't work the first time and also did not work the second time - did not resolve the issue. I was recommending a replacement laptop at this point and they were refusing, which is too bad because clearly I have a lemon and/or their repair team doesn't know how to fix things. After getting the laptop back the second time it began clicking within the body to the right of the touchpad. It didn't do this before so I assume it had something to do with repairs. When I called regarding this they started me with a new repair account saying this is a separate issue and that I would need to again redo all the steps I went through before - restoring to factory settings (which is annoying because you have to redownload all aps and configure windows 8 tiles the way you want them, as well as back up data), uninstall and reinstall drivers.I said I would not do this as the issue is connected and asked to talk to a supervisor. She listened to me but also refused to send me a replacement laptop, saying I needed to send it back again (third time in two months, for a week at a time - very annoying as I am grad student and need laptop to write papers, surf internet, etc). She said that if the repair team thought that a replacement was necessary I could have one otherwise they would continue to try and fix this one.Other than the multitouch going out intermittently the laptop also would occasionally move the typing cursor randomly - not due to me hitting touchpad with the palm of my hand. It did this rarely, but enough that it was an issue.So - technical issues - multitouch intermittently going out, cursor randomly moving, strange clicking noise from body next to touch pad.Attempts to fix - 2 system restores, three mailing back to ASUS for repairs, and an unisntall and reinstall of driversWhat I am left with is - 40 extra bucks in box purchases for Fed Ex (they are picky about what box you ship it in), 3 weeks of going without a laptop and the consequences of that (not being able to work on papers, do email or surf the internet during that time....) and a severe distrust of ASUS as a company and a severe let down of their product and customer service.ASUS claims they have a great warranty, and obviously are well reviewed (its why I chose this laptop) but the warranty only does anybody any good if you actually end up with a functioning product at some point. So far (three months in) that hasn't happened. So the warranty doesn't seem to be good for much of anything but free shipping back and forth to their repair center, at whose mercy you will be if you purchase this laptop, or this brand.I would not recommend this laptop.

Because it had to accommodate for fingers, the keyboard took up half the screen.  I could never see what I was typing.  Touch is interesting but I prefer my pen.

I purchased one it arrived 2 days later, I plugged in the charger, started it up and went through the setup process.  It worked great to begin with, although Windows 8 is a little difficult to adjust to.  After 4 hours of use a low battery warning popped up, telling me to plug in the charger, which was odd considering the charger was plugged in.  So I checked the electrical outlet, working, then got my multimeter and checked the charger, working.Hmmm...  Must be the battery.  The battery can NOT be replaced without taking the back off of the X202E.I contacted Asus only to be told that I must do the follwing:  first, complete the warranty registration which included mailing, not emailing, (that's right US post office snail mail) a copy of the purchase receipt as well as the warranty confirmation email, second, I had to go online to the Asus website and create a service case number, then, once they received the copies of the purchase receipt and warranty confirmation and only then would they talk to me about the X202E not charging.I must say that the Asus customer service is HORRIBLE!!!  I was so frustrated!!!  TOTAL CRAP Asus!!!So I contacted Amazon, and what did they say, \"we have 2 options available for you, a replacement or a full refund.\"  I took the full refund.  NO WAY was I going back with a company that treats their customers the way Asus does!  NO WAY!!!!  Asus doesn't offer customer service they offer customer disservice.  I'll buy a laptop from a company that actually offers good customer service like Apple, HP, Samsung or Dell.

CHOU", "ReviewID": "R2YDYGBTL4E4UA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Disclaimer: I will try to review it without touching the Windows 8 and touch screen, as those seem to be preferences...  This is not my personal laptop and mine is not from a fruit company brand.  My review is purely from the surface value of playing with it one evening.One of my relative got this laptop and wanted to upgrade to SSD.  First of all, there is no hardware maintenance manual published.  I then proceeded down adventure with my Craftsman 41649.  While attempting to open the back of the case, it was discovered that the screws on the back of the unit are unevenly torqued where some are very easy to undo but some are tough to get out.  Material used for the screws are of bad quality where the ones that are tough to get out sustained a little damage in the Philips slots.  The screws are still very much functional, just unsightly with some gauged lips and silver exposing.After the upgrade, I have attempted to make provisioning for the SSD and found that I am unable to use the touchpad as the cursor jumps all over the screen.  It had turned out that one MUST touch the laptop else where in order for the touch pad to function reliably.  This mitigates the possibility of using the laptop while standing up (browsing through recipes while cooking...etc).  The touch screen works well.  The hinges are flimsy with non-linear effort when opening and closing, never-the-less, in line with most in the price range.Overall, the mechanical design and execution of this laptop is a mess; however, it is a good value and a fact hard to argue against.
