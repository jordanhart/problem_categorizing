My only complaint is the inteface with PhotoShop as it does not allow you to expand the tools to a size that can be seen on the small screen. Also an Alt click is not possible with the stylist for like the clone tool so I had to buy a keyboard just for the one function. Maybe that is a PhotoSHop issue. Otherwise, the size and weight are perfect like holding a sketch book. The stylist needs a little adjusting as it is not true to pick however manageable.  I also love the handwriting recognition. It is very true to recognition and there was no pre setup. Waited a long time for this. Am not disappointed. I would definately get the larger RAM and Memory as stated in other reviews it comes dikuted with preinstalled programs that eat into the storage.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing tablet.

Good for notes in class. I can record lectures with the rear facing camera.I have no real complaints about this other than the stylus and the battery life. The Stylus feels cheap and the battery life kinda sucks. I usually get a couple hours on it depending on what I'm doing. I heard that the Surface Pro 2 has a much better battery life though so I guess it's moot. The stylus is pretty nice to draw with but it feels cheap and it's easy to use. I hope that with subsequent generations of this tablet they give it a slot to store the stylus inside of the tablet instead of forcing me to magnetically holster it to the side.Regardless, if you need a decent tablet for work and don't want to carry both a tablet and a laptop this is an excellent choice.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "good computer with a few querks", "Author": "Thomas Snyder \"Morphius\"", "ReviewID": "RRRN8E181QURW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the computer, but have had a few problems with it when organizing my folders and the hundreds of files I put into each folder. I'm an organizer, a planner and implementor, and when my computer can't keep up with my organization plans I get a little upset. My computers must all be stand-alone computers, where nothing is kept online, or in the cloud, as you say. I don't like my computer connected 24/7 to the internet. I turn it on when i need it, and not until then. But my new Surface  seems to want a connection all the time, which I would never allow.
