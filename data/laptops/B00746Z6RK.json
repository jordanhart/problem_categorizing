{"Reviews": [{"Title": "The ultimate travel laptop", "Author": "theLorax", "ReviewID": "R1Z0JOP6PXQI9U", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking to buy a macbook to use as a desktop replacement, or to use as your primary computer, then the Macbook Pro may be a better choice due to it's faster CPU, slightly stronger GPU, and retina display.If you are looking for a laptop that you will be using primarily for traveling, or on the go (library, coffee shop, flights), then look no further than the Macbook Air.It's what you'd expect in this model. It's very sleek, light, and portable. It runs very quiet. The price is significantly lower than the Pro, and the battery life is excellent. Considering the tasks that most people will be running on the Air, it's performance will be more than plenty for most people. The Core i5 and the HD5000 GPU can handle gaming surprisingly well. And normal tasks like web browsing, iLife applications, and movies, music, and web, will run very quickly and smooth.The 11\" is a nice choice as it gives you better mobility, and fits better into small spaces, like the food tray on a coach seat. However, battery life is shorter. But unless you intend to use it non stop on a 12 hour flight, the 9 hour battery will last you for most any situation. The 11\" model also puts the laptop in a price range that gives it a great value that macs are typically not associated with.Startup and shutdown time is very snappy as you'd expect with the mac. The keyboard is very brisk, and I find that my typing is the most fast and accurate than on PC laptop keyboards. The trackpad is very large, has a glass surface, and it has lots of gestures (all useful and practical), and it is a joy to use, unlike the small, plastic, unresponsive trackpads that other laptops have.Apples standard 1 year warranty is the best in the industry. Especially when its augmented with your local Apple store and genius bar, and especially if you decide to purchase AppleCare. Unlike other brands where you only have a 15 day store warranty, and any issues for the next 11.5 months require an RMA claim, and shipping your system to the manufacturer which can take a month. Or for less serious issues, long calls to indian call centers where you are transferred a dozen times, put on hold for long periods of time, and are put through lengthy warranty validation processes.For this latest iteration, the hardware has been bumped up, and the price has been reduced $100 which makes it a great value. This helps to offset the non retina display.However, not all is perfect. I have to deduct one star because of one major caveat. The macbook's RAM is soldered to the motherboard. This means that you cannot upgrade the RAM in the future. RAM upgrades are simple, easy to do, and play a major part in extending the lifespan of your computer. RAM requirements go up faster than CPU and Disk Space needs, because richer content requires more RAM. I have an iMac from 2008 that I still use today thanks to the fact that I was able to double the RAM. If it was not possible, I would have had to sell it on eBay several years ago.My advice is to spring for the extra RAM now if you plan to own this laptop for more than 4 years.What I enjoy about the macbook is they are good to go as soon as you take it out of its box. You don't have to spend hours uninstalling two dozen junkware programs that came installed on your system that are taking up valuable space. You don't have to run registry utilities to clean up after that. Nor do you have to install anti virus scanners and malware and adware removers. You don't need to download and install 96 critical updates in order to patch all the security holes in the operating system, just to keep it safe and afloat.There's no bios to worry about, no blue screens of death, no driver conflicts, and freezing and crashing is extremely rare, instead of a common occurrence it is with PC's. Macs tend to retain their optimal performance, and you won't find the need to defrag your drive every 6 months, and format and reinstall the OS every year to combat performance degradation as I always had to do with my PC desktops and laptops.OSX is Unix based, which is very solid and stable. It's the same platform that mission critical enterprise servers use in corporate data centers. Windows is based on DOS, which is less stable and robust, and more prone to security issues. I have also become frustrated by the design choices in Windows 10, like the removal of the start menu, and the way it is designed to be used with a touch screen as if it's an operating system for a tablet. Even with high end touch screen laptops, I did not use these touch screen features.Another perk is that the whole iLife suit is included for free. And much like iOS, the OSX App Store has great new software that is either free or low cost, coming out every week, giving more incentive to use this platform.So basically, if you want a macbook that is the best for traveling, and has the best value, this should be your first choice.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Not Enough RAM", "Author": "NotTheOnlyFan", "ReviewID": "R1G1WAPSRXOZEU", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "(I've been editing and editing this piece to address comments below.)In a nutshell:  the MacBook Air is a great laptop with a fantastic operating system, but Mavericks clearly prefers OVER 4GBs of RAM... which is the limit of this specific model.The good thing about this new MacBook is Apple marked it down $100 from the previous model.  The bad thing is that you have to spend that $100 on Apple's site to raise this model above 4GBs of RAM (to 8GBs, both your only option and more than enough RAM).Since you can't add RAM after purchase or buy an 8GB model on Amazon, this Amazon Air ships as essentially obsolete.  If past is precedent, new annual-ish release of OS X will require more RAM as the years pass, slowing this model down even more.Here's what a reviewer from The Register has to say on this exact subject, \"As always, there are numerous build-to-order options, including an i7 processor running at 1.7GHz for an extra \u00a3130, although you'd probably want to spend any extra cash on doubling the memory to 8GB of RAM if you intend to keep it for a while.\"Apple Apologists in the comments below insist there is enough ram for the average user.  The average user, if you'll forgive me, has no idea the numerical amount they need.  They just presume for this kind of money Apple included enough RAM, and in this Amazon model instance:  they haven't.  (Since you can't upgrade the RAM before ordering at Amazon.)What casual users do know is that they intend to have a web browser always open with a few taxing sites like Facebook open, an open mail app, perhaps the calender, perhaps iTunes open (but not running) and the messaging app.With the current OS X Mavericks and these aforementioned apps open, you're on the brink of maxing out the four gigs.  Push play on iTunes, open up iWorks, play with a big iPhoto library -- or any combination thereof -- and you've exceeded free RAM.Apple Apologists will inform you that the new compressed memory 'tech' in Mavericks fixes this 4GB problem.  Yes and no.  In my brand new Maverick iMac, I can open all sorts of stuff in crazy combos and the machine runs surprisingly well.  (Stunningly, actually.)  But new iMacs come with 8GBS of RAM, twice what this Amazon Air comes with.But is there something better than software engineering tricks to get the best out of limited RAM?  Absolutely.  Having the right amount of RAM in the first place.From a 2013 MacWorld article, \"Adding extra RAM is the most inexpensive way to improve the performance of your machine and - now that all new Macs are 64 bit - 8GB should be the minimum amount of memory you put.\"From Apple's site regarding compressed memory, \"The more memory your Mac has at its disposal, the faster it works. But when you have multiple apps running, your Mac uses more memory. With OS X Mavericks, Compressed Memory allows your Mac to free up memory space when you need it most. As your Mac approaches maximum memory capacity, OS X automatically compresses data from inactive apps, making more memory available.\"This doesn't mean unlimited memory.  If it did, all Macs would come with 4GBs, right?  Why would they ship iMacs and MacBook Pros with 8GBs if compressed memory made it irrelevant?  MacBook Pros with 8GBs of RAM do now allow you to downgrade to 4 at purchase.  Only upgrade, since, as Apple just old you, \"The more memory your Mac has at its disposal, the faster it works.\"Exactly.  4GBs isn't quite enough.Some folks who have read this review have already posted comments inviting you to disregard it.  One asks where I get my information from.  I own two app (Free Memory/Memory Clean) which accurately report how much system RAM is available.  Mavericks eats up just under/over 4GBS of RAM with a minimal amount of taxing apps open, whether it be on my two year old MacBook Air or my brand new iMac.  Same exact number.Read the reviews of the new iMacs anywhere.  I personally guarantee that not one reviewer is complaining that 8GBs of RAM is too much and adding unnecessary cost to the unit.Case closed, next case.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Travel Companion", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R288KAL737BNVU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got my hands on one of these a couple of days ago and absolutely love it.Pros:- It's very thin and light, yet sturdy.- The CPU runs fast and performance isn't an issue with the applications I need it for, which is mostly web development.- One can definitely feel the difference with the Solid State Drive.Cons- Hard drive could use some more space, so I'd recommend the 256GB model:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00746Z6RK/ref=as_li_tl?creativeASIN=B00746Z6RK&linkCode;=as2&tag;=wwwquickfixau-20&linkId;=ZPRCZEQJQ7GCK46DIt's hard to find cons because it's such a great device, maybe I'll add some later.", "Date": "May 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love the MacBook Air, but You'll Need More RAM", "Author": "Jacob Hantla \"hantla.com\"", "ReviewID": "R3DPFRUGF4JFE6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The cheaper price point (listed at $899 on Apple's store but cheaper on Amazon; thanks again Amazon!) make the MacBook Air more appealing to the masses. As a basic computer, to be used for everyday tasks like email, web browsing, document creation, and even basic media it works well. However, even for these basic functions unless you are careful to only be using a few programs at a time, you will find that the basic model (only 4 GB of RAM) isn't sufficient. And if you need to run a more memory intense program (even iTunes) you will find that 4 GB just isn't enough.So my recommendation is that if you are going to get the basic version with 4 GB you get it straight from Apple, where you an return it no questions asked within 14 days so you can make sure that it will work for your needs. And if you have any question about whether or not you will need more memory (i.e. if you are running anything more than basic email, web, and document creation), you should get the model with 8GB.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "I purchased the 8gb directly from Apple and I love it! It is beautiful, fast, light, and wow the battery life is amazing!", "Author": "Little Whovian \"~ Lee Garibaldi\"", "ReviewID": "RY9VWYO27HKAK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using my Macbook Air 13 inch laptop (with 8gb RAM) for about a week now and I am so happy with it. I already own an old iMac and I have an iPhone 5 as well as the new iPad air but all of my laptops were windows - one Sony and two Toshiba. When it came time to buy a new one, I decided to stick with windows and purchased a Samsung touchscreen. It was horrible. Windows 8 looks like they were trying to copy Apple but failed horribly. I could not get used to using it so I ended up returning it. Then I started looking into buying a Mac. I didn't think I could afford it but when I compared the price with the specs and read a lot of information about it, I came to realize that it was actually a great value for the money. It was a little bit more than I thought I would spent (the Samsung cost me $700 so I had to add quite a bit) but there is absolutely no comparison between the two. There is really no point even mentioning it. This Macbook Air is everything that it promises to be and more!Speed - it is superfast. I have been using it as my main computer for school and work and it is incredible. It turns off and on in an instant. And I love that everything is ready to go as soon as you take it out of the box. I remember how many updates and different downloads I had to do when I got the Windows laptops - every other day there was a new update. I did not understand why a brand new laptop had so many updates; shouldn't it have come already updated since it is new? Anyway, with this Mac I was able to jump right into my schoolwork without any delays. I have never been happier!Let's talk about the look. It is so beautiful, I almost wept in joy when I first took it out of the box. I purchased a clear Moshi case along with a screen protector, keyboard protector and palmgaurd - all of which are basically invisible and do not take away from the beauty of the Macbook at all. The design is super sleek and it is so incredibly light. It is a dream come true. I have yet to travel with it but I can sit with it anywhere I want for hours at a time and be perfectly content. It sits on my lap for hours without getting warm. And let's not forget the battery life. I tested it and even with hours of heavy use from morning to night, by the end of the day, it still had like 30% left. I have been leaving it to charge at night and taking it out during the day to use and it has been excellent. I also love how it connects as a magnet because when my daughter tripped over the wire the other day, my laptop did not come crashing to the ground. Instead the magnet detached and came out. It was no big deal because it had already charged fully and when I went to use it, I saw that it was not plugged in but the battery was almost full. If this had happened with any of my other laptops, it would have been a tragedy for sure. One of my biggest worries with this Macbook was the fact that it is so light and appears to be very fragile. I share a room with a five year old who is just as clumsy as her mother. About two years ago, I purchased a new Sony laptop and not even a month after buying it, my daughter managed to drop it off the table and then step on it, breaking the screen so that it had to be replaced. I couldn't really find anything that would protect it from being dropped but the reviews for the Moshi iGlaze Ultra were very good so I went with that and I love it.I noticed some people were talking about Amazon only having the 4gb RAM and I was very conflicted about which one to get. I usually order everything from Amazon because I have Prime and because they usually have the best deals. However, Apple has a special discount for students and I was able to get that. I spoke with 4 different people and 3 out of 4 told me that I should go with the 8gb rather than the 4. I thought about it and decided that if I was already spending so much money, I might as well put in a little bit more and not regret it later. I don't know if it really makes a difference and maybe I would have been just as happy with the 4gb but I'm happy with my decision. I know that I won't regret it later and I won't be in constant doubt about whether I made the right choice.I cannot think of one thing that I do not absolutely love about this Macbook Air. I was debating between the 11 inch and 13 inch screen and I went with the bigger screen because I do not do that much traveling. I do travel occasionally out of the country and I like knowing that the battery will get me through a 12 hour flight to Israel. I always get frustrated when I have to pay for wifi on the plane and then the battery runs out and I can't charge. I do not get why they would not have charging stations on a flight that is over 12 hours but they can charge you for wifi (then I discovered the bathrooms have a charger but who wants to spend the whole flight in the bathroom?). Anyway, back to the point.This Macbook cannot be beat. It is by far the most beautiful, most lightweight, easiest to use, fastest, and overall most wonderful computer that I have ever owned (and I've owned many!). I expected to be very happy with this Mac but it has surpassed my expectations. I am ecstatic. I guess the only test left for it is the test of time and from what I know about Macs, they are meant to last so I am not at all worried about that. As long as I don't drop it and my daughter doesn't step on it then I think this Mac and I will be together for a long time.Basically, I highly recommend this Macbook Air for students or people who work on computers all day. Even as a main computer. It is excellent. I cannot talk about gaming and things like that because I do not play any games but I am sure there are other reviewers who can provide that info. For my needs, it is fantastic. And I would suggest checking out Apples education prices if you are a student to make sure you are getting the best deal. :)", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love my new  Mac Air", "Author": "VIRGINIA DACOSTA", "ReviewID": "R3PMVT767ZC9TD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After not having a Mac for 15 years - my university only supports PCs and my Lenovo has been nothing but trouble in terms of crashing, viruses, you name it.
