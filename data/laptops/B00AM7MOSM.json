But that is because I neither want nor need all the Dell recovery and the software trying to sell itself to you that comes with the OEM shipped install. But that is for you to decide.I needed a new laptop to support not only the little bit of consulting I still do, but also because it is great for games, such as Houdini Chess.A full featured, solid Dell laptop. My old Dell Latitude just would not die after 10 years, and I had to have a new laptop to support the development software I use now, ASP.NET, SQL server, Visual Studio, etc. At which this laptop with its large screen excels.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "WTFF", "Author": "Arcara", "ReviewID": "RY6SFYFV21I7T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is just freakin awsome other reviewers complain too much expecting a perfect computer which does not exsist(stop nitpicking at the smallest s***) this thing kicks ass fast speed and space smooth on fps game play mmorpgs as well easy to handle and super fast program switching thanks to windows 8 i can use a series of music programs ect.

Thank God for the function key. Also, when you purchase this computer used make sure you contact Dell and get the registration transferred over to your name or else they will not help you with any problems. I had to send a copy of my receipt to Dell to verify that I was the owner. It took some time to resolve but I handled it like a pro.Overall the computer works fine. This is primarily used as a business computer and it has not had any issues what so ever. It was bought in very good condition and it works fin. No cosmetic damage or anything. Like I stated the wireless was turned off and I had to use the function key to get it working but after I did that I had no problems. I am not a huge fan of windows 8 but that is a subjective matter. It's a fast, great, sleek, and beautiful laptop.

The biggest problem I have is the registration of the computer with Dell. I know it's supposed to be helpfull, but it is cumbersome and doesn't flow right. Windows 8 is a problem as well, because it is such a large departure from the windows standard. They should have changed the layout of the keyboard as well, in order to achieve the complete effect on their customers. I'm looking into erasing the hardrive and installing windows 7.
