I had problems with the first two shipments, one from Best Buy and one from Amazon. The left side where the USB ports are located were either cracked or broken. Amazon's customer service was great and I received a replacement immediately. This one is fine, but we are being careful with the USB ports in case this is a manufacturer defect. The laptop otherwise is incredible.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Youmight want to stay clear of this one.", "Author": "Jeff Benham", "ReviewID": "R3J2BUP4DL7S4P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did a lot of online looking for touch screen laptops. Apparently, in general, they are still in the development stage. I chose this one because Sony has quality products. At the time there were no reviews for it on Amazon. When I bought it, it was the last one in stock. There were some reviews for it on the Sony store and a couple of people mentioned a problem with the Wi-Fi disconnecting. After I had it for a few days, that became a problem. I tried several different browser and none helped. Very frustrating, but the problem seemed to clear up after a week or so. Not too long after the hard drive crashed. I had made back up disks but that didn't help. The C and D drives were gone. I sent it back to Amazon (If there were a rating system for Amazon service, it would be 5 star all the way) with no problem. They even helped pay for postage and credited my account promptly.", "Date": "January 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent Convertible", "Author": "J. R. O. Neal \"Islidur\"", "ReviewID": "R3OP65J6IYQZPB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As always, I did a lot of research before making this purchase. I didn't think it possible a few months ago, but I recently found myself wanting a convertible with a larger screen than my Asus Transformer TX300 has. There are some newer enties into the 15\" convertible arena all with about the same specs, but the Sony seemed to have the best design. I spent some time at Best Buy doing my hands on comparisons and durability tests, but did not buy from them because their extended warranties are not as good as Sony's are. I ended up purchasing direct from Sony with the 3 year extended warranty and accident coverage.The device is heavy for what it is. My wife's HP Spectre XT 15 is lighter. I can hold it in tablet mode, but not for too long. I've taken to placing it in presentation mode on my lap so I can use it as a tablet (without the keyboard in the way) and not hold it. The only drawback to this is that Windows does not allow you to swipe down to close apps in this mode, you have to reach around and hit Alt+F4 to close them. The model I purchased has 12GB ram, Nvidia graphics and a 1TB spinning hard drive. In my research, some reviewers mentioned the hard drive was bringing down the overall performance results of tests, so I replaced mine with a Samsung 840 Pro SSD. I ran a PCMark 7 test and received a result of 4558 as opposed to 3562 before the drive swap. So, there was quite an improvement, but it's still below where I'd like to see it. In comparrison, my TX300 tablet scored a 4577 on the same test.Many reviewers also mentioned the unstable single channel wifi. While I had it apart replacing the hard drive, I swapped in an Intel dual channel card and after a driver update I have strong, fast and stable wifi.I've been using the device for a couple of days and overall I'm happy with it. The screen is probably the best part of it. It's very crisp, colorful and bright. Everyday work and play seems more enjoyable and movies are something to see on this screen. I was having some issue with my first touch not registering, it got better after I calibrated the touchscreen, but it still happens from time to time. I'm hoping a driver update is in the works to address this. The Ntrig pen is a great feature. I haven't had the opportunity to draw much with it, but the handwritting is excellent. I tend to hold it in my hand and use a combination of pen and touch as if it were a natural thing to do. The device has no option for storing the pun, so I ordered a clip from Targus for it which seems to work just fine. The overhang design of the sides does make it akward getting to ports, but it's not too much of an inconvenience. During my initial run of updates and software installs, I did it on a full charge and unplugged. I was basically pushing the device the entire time and got about 4.5 hours out of it. I'd like to see a longer run time and believe that under normal, less demanding conditions I will see over 6 hours.Sony includes a lot of software with the device for drawing and editing music and video. Some may call this bloatware, but it's quality software that can be valuable if you put it to use. Other bloatware is at a minimum and easily removed.I haven't seen any real issues with it yet and it appears to be fairly quick at start up and performing tasks. I think it will be a good device for some time to come. However, I'm uncertain about any potential warranty claim now that Sony has made the decision to get out of the computer market. Hopefully I won't ever hae to find out.", "Date": "April 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's wonderfull", "Author": "OSCAR ELEAZAR BOADA ROMERO", "ReviewID": "R43HV2IP14U44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great performance .

This old Sony has been fantastic!  I still use it daily and everything still works!  As a matter of fact, the battery is still original and I can still get approximately 2 hours per charge out of it.  My wife, on the other hand, bought a Samsung 1 1/2 years ago and it's not held up so well.  The keyboard has intermittent issues, the laptop will randomly turn off, and the battery will no longer power the laptop more than 10 minutes.  Recently, she's made comments that my old Sony is built better than her Samsung.  She said, \"the display is higher resolution and crisper and the keyboard lights up and is just plain better, etc.\"  Because of the issues she's having with her Samsung, I decided to purchase a new Sony laptop for her for Christmas.  A few days before Christmas, I read some of the reviews of Sony laptops and folks were having problems with the WIFI.  Complaints ranged from low throughput to flat out not being able to make a connection.  I started to get worried because I already purchased the laptop and Christmas was fast approaching.  I was hoping at this point that the problems were isolated to a few computers.  Wouldn't you know it?  On Christmas day, we experienced the same exact problems with the new Sony laptop.  The WIFI only seemed to work when the wireless router was in direct line of sight.  When tried to \"Sign-Out\" (log-off), the computer would act like it was logging off of my wife's account, but the computer would never fully log-off.  Before going to bed on Christmas night, I hit \"Sign-Out\" and the little \"I'm busy\" spinning wheel came up on the screen.  Since this is normal, I simply thought to myself, the computer is logging off.  Several minutes later, it became apparent that the computer was stuck.  The next morning, the spinning wheel was still spinning away.  I recommend doing a lot of research before dropping $1100 on a laptop.  Unfortunately, brand loyalty doesn't mean all that much these days.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "an inferior laptop", "Author": "Antosh", "ReviewID": "R3B1UB02LJEP59", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased one of these for my wife for Christmas. The laptop comes loaded with \"software bloat\" which took a day or two to remove. The display has an irritating habit of brightening and darkening at the merest whim, sometimes simply by inserting a USB cable into the USB port, the screen suddenly brightens and then darkens a few minutes later. WiFi reception on the laptop is intermittent even within 15 feet of our router. When one adds the ludicrous Windows 8 operating system to the mix, we are beginning to wander why we didn't stick with our old Sony. One thing we are certain of, this will be the last Sony laptop that we ever purchase.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hard Drive failure in less than 2 weeks.......", "Author": "Payton-D", "ReviewID": "R2NK1E2PYES5J4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Need I say more.
