Being new to Razer and its cult, I thought that I was in over my head buying an expensive computer. Yes, it is very expensive but it is worth every cent. This remarkable piece of innovation is a true change to the game of the video game industry. The slimness is too sexy, I feel like a stud carrying it around in public. The fans are quiet and effective and the light up keyboard is very bright. As far as the actual frame, the computer itself is very sturdy and tough (although I would not recommend dropping it). Along with the exterior features, Razer has several app features that are very helpful to novice and advance gamers. I like to use Razer Synapse to program different keys for my RTS and shooter games like LoL and BF4. Razer also has a great warranty service. I sent in the computer after my friend spilled water on the keyboard and was able to get the laptop back within a week. The shipping was free and the computer came back like it was brand new. I expect this fine piece of gaming hardware to last me 4-5 years. Mad props to Razer!Pros:Slim factorKeyboardOverall lookGraphicsBatteryCons:TouchpadWebcamCleanliness (The speakers and touchpad get dirty easily + smudges)Note: If you are going to purchase a Razer Blade, make sure that you take advantage of Razer's peripherals. They are best known for their peripherals and a simple touchpad won't help your gaming experience.", "Date": "February 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "No surprises, met expectations", "Author": "Daniel B Quinto", "ReviewID": "R2Q4VTSW3J3T0D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I needed a desktop replacement and the workstations I researched had more memory but less processing power than the gaming computers. I wanted a portable computer that was light, durable, and fast. The Razer met  my expectations. It is sleek and solid and, so far, seems to work as advertised. The logo on the cover is definitely geared toward a younger owner than me, but it is a gaming computer, after all. The power cord is bulky for a portable component, especially compared to the Apple system, but they thoughtfully added a rubber belt to bind up the cord and transformer into a neat package. I am not so thrilled with Windows 8 but that is not Razer's fault. Overall, seems to work as I had hoped with no real disappointments.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Laptop for everything", "Author": "Chang bum Park", "ReviewID": "R3F5BM32YD43I3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This item was beyond my expectation.Gaming performance is good andThis is really thin and light as well.I can say its display is the only part that i feel inconvenient.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazingly Good", "Author": "Brian Beckman", "ReviewID": "R7DEU789U0C74", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Fast, portable, really nice build and quality feel.

The only inconvenience I've found is how heated up it gets. When gaming I use a cooling pad, and still some keys feel extremely hot ('i' and 'k' specially). Still, it's pretty awesme. However, 2k is a lot of money for a laptop, if you feel like paying that amount, it's by all means worth it (assuming you'd be moving it around a lot), but know that for this price you can get much better laptops that are just a little bit bigger.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop overall except for 1 HUGE problem.", "Author": "Joseph Kim \"joseph\"", "ReviewID": "R2YPLTUK1JGZ1F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all lets get out of the way that this is by far the best laptop out thereif you have the money for it. period.I Would have given it 5 stars if not for a major issue with this laptop.I would close the lid of the laptop to put it to sleep mode and once I made sure the white light was blinkingindicating that it had gone to sleep mode, I slipped the razer blade in my backpack and went about my day.Sometime during the day I'd feel my back getting hot and once I realized that the heat was coming from mybackpack, I quickly opened my backpack and for some particular reason, my razer blade was turned on.Or on a different occasion, I would close the laptop thinking that it was in sleep mode and left it overnightonly to found out in the morning the laptop burning hot and that it had been turned on the entire night.As anyone with a little tech knowledge know, heat is an electronics worst enemy and significantly dampers its longevity.and also being turned on the entire time, drains the battery life exremely.This happened on my previous razer blade and my current one that I got as replacementLet me know in the comments below if anyone else is expecting this problem", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Thoroughly Pleased.", "Author": "mjbartho", "ReviewID": "RFUQWMGWIZDNH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Before now, I have usually stayed toward more budget laptops still able to play games acceptably. This blows them out of the water. I can't speak for the games requiring the highest graphics capability but it plays Starcraft II, Diablo III, League of Legends, and Final Fantasy 14: ARR beautifully.As far as the criticism people have about the viewing angle, yes if you move your head 5 inches up or 5 inches down, the screen does wash out. However, assuming you're not going to be gaming while doing jumping jacks, this is not a problem. The design seems very sturdy--in particular the screen panel is not wobbly at all (which has been the case for most of my previous laptops). The speaker quality actually surprised me. While I'm not a audiophile, I noticed the difference here.My favorite aspect of this (and the primary reason I bought it) is the extreme portability. It's quite thin and quite light (not quite ultrabook level but you can see the exact specs on the detail page) and again, it doesn't feel flimsy or cheap at all.Personally, I don't count pixels too heavily, especially for smaller screens. If you insist on 1080p+ then you might not want to grab this one. However, if you don't mind that and are looking for a laptop that is both very portable and very capable of playing games, this should be near the top of your list.", "Date": "December 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Complete Solution", "Author": "bernard", "ReviewID": "R3O8GTPN2CVD7Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pro:Battery 6-7 on powersaverLooks everyone will ask how you got a black Mac. =)765GTX maxes DOTA 2, Deadspade 3, BF3 on high, SC2, etc.SSD/Fast Cores 5-7 sec boot times.

Like a black Mbp but with more juice.Cons:While I find the machine amazing, in the next iteration I would like to see the following which are missing currently.1. An IPS display. Doesn't even have to be full HD, 1600x900 is fine, the problem is the current panel it has. It has awful viewingangles.2. An ethernet port. When it comes to gaming, you need to have the fastest possible connection. The wireless card goes up to N, not AC. A direct connection more reliable, thus should have been included.3. SD card slot.4. If fitting all the aforementioned in an issue, rolling out a 15\" version would be a great idea in my opinion.5. Maybe a trackpoint would be nice6. Linux support. The trackpad was annoying to get working due to proprietary controls. Bring in some quality drivers please.------------------------While maybe a bit far fetched, a physical graphics card shutoff switch would be amazing.

My first order had a problem with a fan that made it vibrate and make a disturbing noise. This one has a hiss on the power supply and the webcam sometimes flashes in different colours. Additionally, the screen is quite lacking, not only in resolution, which I think is still acceptable at 900p but the contrast is quite poor, as well as colour reproduction.Overall its a good computer, I like its portability and design, but the quality of the internals should reflect the observable build quality.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good laptop but fear hardware issue", "Author": "MDH", "ReviewID": "R1X3KBMVHXQ66N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Had on pre-order for my son who was so excited to receive mid-August just in time for school. He really likes the machine in particular for gaming of course.He just returned home for mid-term break and told me it has been making a ticking noise for a few weeks now. It sounds to me like the fan(s). If you lift the machine slightly and tip to one side you can sometimes get it to stop but eventually it will start again. This is not normal fan whirring noise it is a fast tick-tick-tick......Unfortunately we shipped this onward from NY to Bermuda where we live so returning it is a pain and expensive (IBC courier to NY). Also the complications of duty already paid - approx.$500. Just wondering if anyone else has encountered this problem before taking it further.It's more of an annoyance than anything else but still for a $2000 machine you don't expect this sort of thing.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best laptop ive ever bought", "Author": "matt whelan", "ReviewID": "R1CD09PO412FWQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Well, usually im not a laptop person. had an old alienware m11x, it was nice but too hot and the battery was about 45 mins when gaming. now coming from custom built desktops im used to extreme amounts of power. now i have a friend who paid $1500 for a mac book pro, its a very nice laptop i must say, but part for part this destroys that. the macs have an i5 with no gpu, mostly ment for processing heavy applications. on the other hand the blade has an i7 4702hq processor, 4 physical cores, 8 virtual cores. it also has a gtx 765m gpu, which surprisingly is able to handle far cry on ultra. that being said bought the razer sabretooth controller i believe, that turned this laptop into a mobile xbox one/ ps4, and their not even out yet. this laptop also has 8 gigs of ram and ids far superior to the 360 and ps3. it also comes with a ssd and after counting i figured a full boot up is about 7 seconds. Alot of people complain about the screen, but its not that bad, 1600x900 is pretty close to full hd, and the matte finish allows you to use it in direct sunlight at about 50% brightness. Now that i laid out all the goods,here comes the great. The size, and battery. First off, this laptop is actually a bit thinner that the macbook pro, while packing faster hardware and a better battery. Now the battery is the best i have had in any laptop ive owned. i got about 4-5 hours of GAMING on one charge. that being said about 8 hours or so of normal use if i putit into powersaving.

With just websurfing or light work, considerably longer and cooler.  It's completely silent.Windows 8 sucks -- there's no redemption for that.

Nearly every review I read online about this laptop faulted the screen, but I see no problems. It's bright and it's a screen. I moved from a 17 inch laptop with the same resolution and find this perfect. Text is readable, and all that extra space is filled with content. I like how portable this laptop is and was one requirement I had for a laptop. This laptop is a perfect candidate for amazon's 14 inch laptop sleeve which provides piece of mind and fingerprint protection, which is one I guess downside to having the best looking laptop around. Don't get me wrong I love the look of this rig, but your grandparents will treat you like you're 3 again. I guess it's the glowing green snake. I just want to say before going on however that I didn't buy this laptop because It rocks games. Here's my list of incentives: battery life 30%, Portability 20%, Power under the hood 25%, Gaming potential 15%, Looks 5%, last 5% comes down to other things such how put together and reliable the system is. I try to not make the same assumptions as many online review sites do and I wouldn't have bought this laptop If I did.Now this laptop is now nearly a year old and technology changes rapidly. This is actually why I think it's such a good deal right now. The processor is extremely powerful and the mSATA drive is the new standard for speed. These things aren't going to change in the next couple of years so drastically that this computer won't stack up. 8GB of ram sounds so little compared to other gaming laptops (read bricks) but the only time I use it all is when I'm doing a virus scan. Webcam is ehh. I opened the app on accident and it was grainy but I have an Iphone if i want to see you.A few other things people will mention about why this laptop isn't worth it is that the new one is so much better, but the new one has even greater heating issues (not necessarily bad, but noticeable in this one and I wouldn't want it much hotter), and the new screen as beautiful as it looks, can't be fully utilized while gaming and maintaining frame rates. Battery life suffers too. If a touch screen is your thing then go for it. Windows is now much nicer with touch, and I am starting to understand now all the windows 8 hate. Available ports is often mentioned as lacking too, but think about it. When is the last time you used a DVD? Or plugged into ethernet? A VGA projector plug further adds bulk without function. I'm glad to have a smaller laptop without these unnecessary plugs. You can get an external DVD drive for ~30$ or an ethernet plug for ~10$. The laptop sleeve you're going to buy will fit it.Just buy this laptop. If you've come far enough to actually read this review and actually consider this laptop then you're ready to actually experience what the Razer 14 has to offer. From the games I've played, both Civ 5 and Skyrim play on maxed out settings amazingly well, with the fan only kicking up to levels you can hear when fighting alot, just turn up the sound, it runs very quite.I think windows 8.1 is this computers biggest fault, but I'll get used to it. I've just basically turned off Start and it's mostly exactly like windows 7.I bought this from amazon's warehouse deals. The 1,000 price difference over this years model made my decision easy. Anything you buy from amazon warehouse has been inspected and it's condition listed. Mine simply didn't come in the original box, but everything was present. Probably just an open box and it saved be $$$, it's definitely worth looking into.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good home and mobile PC", "Author": "AkihiroMatsuo", "ReviewID": "RRQ4IEV184ATY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "tought battery. best slim.high power.good typing keyboard. but a littile heavy weight.I think good choice for Club Event DJ .", "Date": "May 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excelent Notebook!", "Author": "Felipe R.", "ReviewID": "R26HAKDNGY8TR6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The notebook is excelente, but the screen could be better, I mean I got a Dell Nstudio 1458 with HD resolution and it is better than this screen.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop", "Author": "Peeravuth Roeksasut", "ReviewID": "R12VXXD7YN8GYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Falling in love with designs and performance.Amazing for how thin it is.What did they seen in their dream to create this masterpiece.The heat is annoys a little.The battery lift is not that good.I will see the next model for improvement.Overall : Light weight and high performance loving it", "Date": "May 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer, Poor customer support", "Author": "Stan Weiner", "ReviewID": "R1N3YRR7TTNFE9", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Great computer.
