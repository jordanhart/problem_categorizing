{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Bill Larson", "ReviewID": "R7FBNXKGUIQD6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this to use as a desktop computer that I can occasionally take with me. I must say, I'm very impressed. I have an external monitor and mouse hooked up to it. Having two monitors is great, but I find myself using the laptop monitor a lot due to the touchscreen. Windows 8 is really worthless without a touchscreen monitor. I've been gaming with it and it has handled everything I throw at it wonderfully. I use external speakers, so the tiny laptop speakers that it comes with hasn't been an issue. They're good for a portable device, but not for playing music in your home at loud volumes. All things considered, I couldn't be happier with this machine. Add in that I got Amazon Prime shipping and it's a gem!", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for the money", "Author": "Clawhandle1", "ReviewID": "R31NMY1AEXIGRQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This unit performs as I expected. The battery life is incredible and makes this laptop one of the most efficient ones that I have ever owned. I feel I got my money's worth with this unit. My only complaint is that while sitting it next to a friends macbook, I noticed that the colors on the mac display were much more realistic that this unit. However, since this was less costly than a mac, I feel I got good value for the money", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Value", "Author": "AK", "ReviewID": "RDWCAQ5XPL546", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great price for a gr8 product.

It looks nice, works well, and has some fun features like a touchscreen and fingerprint sensor.
