This machine is amazing.Pros:1. It looks amazing.2. It is so incredibly light (after traveling this weekend with my old Dell XPS 15\", I was glad to see what 3.5 pounds felt like).3. Startup/wake-up is very fast.  It boots up in less than 10 seconds and resumes from sleep in about 2 seconds.4. Power, memory and storage enough to serve as my main working laptop.  I got this to replace my Dell XPS and this will do it easily.  With the i7 Ivy Bridge and 256 SSD it has plenty of muscle. Also, the screen, keyboard and track pad (which I've seen others have concerns with elsewhere) are great to me.  I don't use graphics intensive programs or work with massive files - mostly just excel, word, internet and email for me - but I do have a real-time trading platform that is somewhat intensive open with several other programs and have no issues whatsoever.5.  Build quality seems to be top notch - no bending, strong hinge, good key feel - and it's very quiet.The only thing I wish this had was a screen with a higher resolution (1600x900 is the max).  Also, I had to remove some of the ubiquitous, extraneous programs all of the manufaturers add.  I've had to adjust a few thing I work with regularly to accommodate the screen resolution, but no problem after considering the weight, portability, power, smoothness and looks of this machine.

I researched it extensively and decided it was worth the money for a long-term, next 3-5 year laptop (assuming that I can upgrade the RAM and 256 SSD).Everything you have read about the build quality and design is true. I was grinning from ear to ear until 1 week later, the touchpad acted up.  It's not sensitive, it was/ is uncontrollable: highlighting , selecting, moving things and not moving where I needed it to be.  A reboot does NOT resolve this and I have not installed any 3rd party software. The issues resolves itself spontaneously, but comes back in a matter of hours to 2 days. The issues was witnessed by Samsung 2nd Line Tech as I allowed him to take control of it over the net. He saw it moving all over the place and apologized for the issue right out of the box. I am away and cannot have AMAZON ship a replacement to my location. I have to wait until i get back.  This is awful!The slow WiFi stories are true. You need to simply amend the power settings.  The battery life is good. There are many advanced options to tweak your power consumptions and have selective components performThe speakers sound hollow and baseless. Using it at high levels vibrates the casing, producing an awful noise. I was was very disappointed.I had higher expectations for a pricey laptop.***EDIT***You CAN upgrade the SSD, you CANNOT upgrade the 8GB memoryTear down pictures: [...]Tear down video:  [...]**EDIT**02/04/14- I had the track pad replaced by Samsung and it worked fine from thereafter.- Also, a year and 7 months later, the battery needs to be replaced. It just doesn't last as long as it use to. With my Square Trade warranty, it will cost me nothing. It's also recently getting hotter. Before, it was always cool.

IMO The Series 9 (S9) blows away the Air (sorry).  The S9 is better looking, better screen, better keyboard, and only $100 more for a much bigger screen, all other items configured the same.Comparing to the Air, the specs say the 15\" S9 is 3.51 lbs where the 13\" Air is 2.96, but I can't tell the difference holding the two.Other miscl.

Hopefully this will improve when Windows 8 arrives.The power connector doesn't have a magnetic (or mechanical) release to prevent damage when accidentally stepping on the power cord.The power connector is uncomfortably close to the USB charging port (this is the port which allows charging your phone when the laptop is off, however I was able to use this with a standard USB cord)KB back light can't be turned on when there's ambient light -- silly limitationThere's no ecosystem of accessories.  For instance I haven't been able to find a suitable sleeve for the S9 (I want one that stays on and prevents scratches.  I found a 13\" one, but no 15\".)The images on Amazon don't show the \"Intel Inside\" and \"Windows\" stickers which uglify the laptop, though less than usual.Thanks to other reviewers for the tips on WiFi power setting in Control Panel.", "Date": "August 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Traveling powerhouse!", "Author": "SinJin", "ReviewID": "R3M13NN4OTG9RT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I purchased this computer in September 2012.  After using it for both school and work, I can say this is one of the best laptops on the market.In terms of speed: Fast, reliable and start up is under 20 sec. Their is a slight speed change between plugged in and battery power.  However, users should be aware of the power settings to adjust this. Also their is a lag time for older USB external memory. If its 2.0 and above, transfer rate of a 3GB file is approx 1min. 3.0 is about 45sec. Older than 2.0 seems to slow down.  I do not expect it to be faster but for some reason it does not max out the transfer rate.OS: Purchased with WIN 7 Upgraded to WIN 8Multi-threading: As a person in the IT field, it puts a smile on my face when I can program in C++, run a mat lab simulation, check e-mail, download a file and add several other functions without skipping a beat. Basically it pays to have the better chip.  If you are a normal user that does not program the lower end chip will do fine.Lightweight and excellent on power.  I still carry my power cord, but I can keep the laptop on standby all day without fear of a shutdown due to power loss. Note: The brick on the power cord is actually small and lightweight! an excellent thought by Samsung to consider this in their design.A few improvements for Samsung:The rubber tabs on the bottom tend to come out which leave the computer components exposed thru a small hole! One needs to clean the area and re-glue the tab. But be careful with using a solvent to clean the area.  Please address this!, Less than 2 months and they are falling out is not good!Note, I carry my laptop in a timbuk2 bag which is designed to carry my laptop. It has a special slot with added protective padding.  I may travel but, I do not abuse my equipment and it does not endure my previous employment conditions.  Note: My last laptop lasted 7 years and endured 2 deployments and still runs!I thought the dongle for the Ethernet connection would not bother me, I was wrong. I while at work if I am not careful and move my computer over it will pull at the connection point. You need to be extra careful when connecting any cables to this PC. From my point of view this is minor issue, however it is also intended to be a traveling PC, having sturdy connections for projectors, Ethernet and such should be considered more. That said, also be careful with the power connection as well.Upgrading the SDD! I realize that larger size dives are more expensive, but with today's programs and file sizes, an upgraded option would be worth the price point! I have gotten used to using external HDD & SDD's but their is something to be said when you can hold all that information on your PC drive without the need to carry an external.This of course does not come with a DVD drive, but in some ways it is better off due to third party DVD burners and drives that can be purchased.  Plus they tend to be better quality. I presume this eliminates a lot of Hassle from Samsung.Overall, a great PC! I recommend it for Students and IT professionals who are looking for a lightweight traveling powerhouse.Gamers should move on, however it does seem to run my old FFVII great!

Instantly attracted to the slick features, this was easily the best ultrabook currently on the market. Matte finish definitely persuaded me to choose this model over the HP Spectre's too-reflective screen. Nevertheless, 20 minutes into the set-up process the trackpad froze for 30 seconds. The next time it froze was for a minute or longer. So frustrating! Even after Geek Squad installed the latest touchpad driver from Samsung's website it still wasn't fixed.

I was in the market for a new laptop late in the summer and settled on the new HP envy 15\"  Which I optioned to the max and had delivered.  The HP was to be a portable desktop replacement and it's specs were very impressive, it's performance, portability, and battery life less so.  I returned the HP and looked for a replacement thinking about all of the things that the HP was doing wrong for me. I settled on getting an ultrabook and I needed it to be light with great battery life.  This was the largest UB available and so it was my defacto choice.I have been in love with it ever since.  The battery life is amazing, I can put it on my stomach and run it all night while watching TV(I use it to daytrade and analyze stocks and financial markets), it runs my trading platform(which is calculation intense) effortlessly, and can even play 2D games without any problem.The complaints about the laptop, specifically the screen viewing angle are valid, the screen does not like to be shared with someone next to you.  As far as the track-pad, I always plug in a mouse so I have never used it for any significant time.  The keyboard works just fine for me.I can take this thing onto a long flight and play games or watch movies the whole time.

Almost", "Author": "BuzzCut", "ReviewID": "R3AOM1U2WN12KA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "15\" Samsung Series 9 with 256GB SSD, i7 processor and 8GB RAM. The specs are great and the Series 9 has an elegant, slim, solid unibody-type design. I couldn't live with less than 256GB storage and I'm really glad I didn't settle for the 128GB flavor.1) Machine is very fast - boots from cold in less than 10secs, resumes from sleep in less than 2. Incredible. Screams through any task I give it.2) Screen is about right at 1600x900 - enough pixels for side-by-side documents while not requiring a microscope to read text. Screen is matte which is nice but I am not as impressed with the color rendition as others seem to be - it's ok but nothing amazing.3) Battery life is very good - I regularly achieve 8 hours or more which for me effectively equals all day use. Very impressive.4) Audio is OK but I wouldn't use for listening to music. I did have to make a change in the audio settings to boost the max volume to a more usable level (Speaker Properties > Enhancements > Loudness Equalization).5) I liked the fnLock key with its LED which allows me to use the Fn keys for screen system controls (brightness, sound etc) without requiring the Fn button each time.While the Series 9 has a lot going for it I had to make a few adjustments to really enjoy the machine properly:-1) Downgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 7 - just couldn't get on with 8 and needed this to be focused 100% on the desktop experience. During this process I also reclaimed all the drive space partitions which gives me 230GB of usable capacity. Much happier now. YMMV.2) Touchpad - I'm used to a MacBook Pro touchpad which is pretty much perfect (even when running Windows in Bootcamp) and the Series 9 touchpad was unpleasant at first - sometimes selecting when I wanted to scroll, right-clicking when I wanted to left-click etc. In the end I found a different driver for this that solved all these issues (ironically NOT the latest version - the best was Elan version 11.6.4.001 for those interested for themselves). I also disabled right corner clicking and reversed scroll direction (\"natural\"). Feels better now.3) Keyboard backlight - there is no manual control over this if the sensor decides the room is too bright. In my experience there were times I wanted it on but the software refused me (why? let ME decide!). So I blocked the light sensor with a small piece of tape and now I have full control over brightness. Works but I really shouldn't need to do this.4) I had a key (BACKSPACE) that was temperamental - sometimes didn't register key-presses at all. I was almost going to return the machine but thought I'd try a blast of compressed air first from one of those pressurized cans with a straw. Out popped a microscopic piece of plastic debris and Voila! - now it works perfectly.5) The micro-ports are a bit of a pain - not happy about carrying adapters around for Ethernet and VGA but I got used to that with the MacBook Pro VGA dongle (didn't like it there either) and the Series 9 is much thinner - Samsung at least provide the Ethernet adapter in the box. Charger port isn't as elegant as Apple's mag-safe but it does the job.So as you can see with a few software tweaks Samsung could have had a 5-star machine - basically ship with a better touchpad driver and backlight software that gives full control to the user and you're golden.Overall though I now love my Series 9, it just needed a little TLC at the start.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Garbage", "Author": "Emilio Ferrucci", "ReviewID": "R1WKXHIK6FEA1E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Here's my story. I wanted to buy a premium 15 inch ultrabook and one of the only options was this one. So I bought one (not from amazon), but had to send it back because the trackpad was loose and it made a very annoying sound when tapped in the center. So I got my second series 9, but unfortunately it was as bad as the first if not worse: some of the keys on the keyboard made annoying sounds when pressed (the space bar made a rustling sound and the enter key had quite a large repertoire of squeaks) and the overall layout of the keys was asymmetrical. In addition the sound card must have had some sort of defect because it made a faint background buzzing noise through several pairs of earphones. So I sent that one back as well and got a refund. As time passed I needed a PC more and more, and since I didn't see any other 15 inch ultrabooks that I liked I decided to try my luck once more with the Samsung series 9. If you're thinking \"what a moron\", you are correct. The third one I got was the worst of the lot: wifi reception was terrible, I was getting a wifi signal which was a tenth as strong as what other computers were getting. In fact, I practically couldn't browse the internet without being in the same room as the router.I find it a real pity that Samsung designed a remarkable computer and didn't spare any resources to assemble the units with care and test them before putting them on the market. I also find it very disrespectful. Notice how no two units had more than one of the issues I mentioned:- loose trackpad- noisy keyboard- buzzing noise in headphones (probably sound card defect)- terrible wifi receptionSo this isn't about a persistent problem with the series 9 model, nor is it about me being fussy. It's about Samsung not doing their job and respecting their clients, who are paying a very high price tag for this model and don't deserve the burden of sending products back. I also must mention that I contacted Samsung support by email and never got an answer (I was hoping they might fix the wifi issue with the third computer, since everything else was working ok).If you want to take the risk of getting a defective unit, ridiculous assistance, and having to send the product back, wait for refund etc, then go ahead and buy a series 9. You might be very lucky and everything might be working fine (in which case you will have bought an excellent computer). Or you might not. I now have a Lenovo S300 which is a completely different type of laptop (budget notebook), but it has no issues, does what it promises and the keyboard, trackpad and general crafting are MUCH better than on the series 9.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "amazing laptop, mediocre linux support", "Author": "Timo", "ReviewID": "RV5MNOGI6DZFI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop hardware is awesome, though the linux support is only mediocre.I've been using it for 3 days, and am having trouble going back to my very nice lenovo x301. The screen is just outstanding. The 1600x900 screen is sharp, and works great even with a window behind me. The keyboard is pretty good, though I still like the lenovo keyboard better. The trackpad is so much better than the lenovo. The dongles/converters for ethernet, micro-hdmi and vga are annoying, but manageable.My main complaint with the hardware is that the video outputs cannot power a big monitor. The HDMI port is limited to 1920x1200, which is fine for a dell 24\", but can't power a 27\" or 30\". The VGA port is limited to 2048x1280. I really wish it had a Display Port output, or at least a dual-link HDMI. On the other hand, the HDMI port does work through my receiver's HDMI input, unlike the Display Port on my lenovo.The linux support is only mediocre. The screen flickers on a 3.2 kernel (default for  ubuntu 12.04), but this seems to be fixed in 3.4. The trackpad needs some tweaking for right and middle clicks, as well as palm detection. The battery level and whether it is plugged in is only sometimes detected properly. The keyboard backlight works sometimes, but the buttons to change the backlight brightness don't work. On the other hand, sound and video works great, even over hdmi, as does the camera. I haven't extensively tested 3d performance, but it appears to work alright. Suspend works just fine.

Getting sick and tired of it, but happy that the Samsung Series 9 A03 is going to work out just fine.I'm coming from a 17\" Macbook Pro, the last version ever made (i.e. Sandy Bridge, Thunderbolt, etc.). Overall I love this laptop. It's the thinnest 17\" on the market with a gorgeous 1900x1200 display.Unfortunately, it's so heavy to lug around. The first 2 laptops I purchased was the Sony Vaio Z, and the 13\" Asus Zenbook UV32D. Ultimately, 13\" wasn't big enough for me, regardless of resolution. I'm a UX/UI designer and coder so high resolution (1920x1080) on a teeny 13\" does me no good. I can't squint at pixels all day. After some apprehension, I picked up a great deal on a used Samsung 9 A03 here on Amazon.The good first.. this thing is SEXY. Love the build quality, love the design. Kinda wish it wasn't a shade of gray-blue. Would have preferred jet black, or even a lighter gray, but I'll get over it. The 256gb SSD is quick. Quick boot times, quick wake times.I've read many complaints regarding the keyboard and trackpad. Yes, the keyboard seems to have slightly less travel then even some other ultrabooks. Is it a detriment? Not really. I code all day, and average 110+ wpm (not code, but actual words.. I can get 130+wpm when I'm actually trying to type a lot of wpm). I can confidently say the keyboard is just fine. Is it a cherry MX mechanical keyboard? No... will it cause you to forget the English language and misspell every other word? No. It works fine for me, so no complaints. Trackpad as well. Seems to work perfectly fine, and this is coming from a macbook owner.. the mother of all trackpads.I've heard a lot of bad reviews about the speakers as well. Yes, they sound like laptop speakers, but they sound fine to me. They don't distort at normal listening volumes. I don't really get it. I work on a laptop, I'm surrounded by people who work w/ laptops, and I've never met anyone who just CRANKS their speakers. Who does that? At work, you don't out of courtesy so you use headphones. At home, most people usually have a music playing device or speakers to hook up to. If you're the poor sap, who's main music listening setup is not good headphones, or a pair of 20 dollar speakers.. but laptop speakers.... pleas e do yourself a favor and just stop listening to music entirely.Battery life, freaking awesome. Destroys my wife's Macbook air by a couple hours.1600x900 on a 15\" is bearable. Would much rather have 1920x1080/1200, but oh well.Which brings me to my 1 real quasi-complaint, which is the screen. Overall, the screen is actually pretty good. Extremely bright, and matte. However, the fact that it's not IPS is painfully obvious. Colors start to wash out if you're not looking STRAIGHT on the monitor. The Good thing is, this is mostly noticable when the screen is entirely black, which for many people is never the case. Being in the profession I am, I tend to be very acute to viewing angles. Oddly, the horizontal angles are fine, which sucks because I don't care about horizontal, I care about vertical.Either way, it's bearable. I don't think I would have kept this laptop if I paid 1700 new for it. The display issue wouldn't have been acceptable. But at 1110 like new  but used, it's a steal.****Update****after less then 2 weeks of ownership, I decided to return this laptop once again and dock my review from 4 to 2 stars. Why? Wifi performance.First, I noticed that on my 5ghz N-band connection ( I have a dual band router), the connection was oddly slower then on my 2.4ghz band. This is literally 10 feet from the router with no obstructions. I looked into the issue, and did all the typical bios/driver updates along with the power management settings within Windows. Didn't solve anything. Other's were having some success in changing the configuration with their routers. \"Turn off wireless-A, or wireless-B\" or \"try this and this in your router\". Heck no. Why should I have to manipulate my router settings just to accomodate the crappy wifi reception of 1 laptop. My router services at least 10 devices at any given time.

Consequently, video conferencing creates an echo for the other party that no matter what, cannot be corrected.  I've checked all the appropriate noise and echo reduction boxes in the microphone device screen and the Samsung tech people were basically useless.  Problem is not application specific as I've tried Skype, WebEx and GoToMeeting, all with the same results.  Why they didn't put the mic above the screen next to the camera is anyone's guess.  The only thing that prevented me from sending it back is the Bluetooth feature which allows me to override the internal mic and speakers by connecting to my Bluetooth ear piece.

I didn't buy an Asus Zenbook because of poor reviews for the keyboard. The series 9 keyboard might be the best laptop keyboard I've ever used. It is what I would expect of a laptop for $1800.Unfortunately, I would not as of the date of this review recommend this laptop because it does not yet have the correct software factory installed and does not have any support for the correct software on the Samsung website. In fact the laptop with the specs that I purchased has no support whatsoever on the Samsung website. As a result of the incorrect software installed on the machine, the wireless disables itself and makes it impossible to re-enable. It took 3 hours of chatting with the Samsung online support to identify the Samsung Easy Settings software to be the problem. Naturally they wanted me to keep reinstalling the software, but the software they told me to download and the software preinstalled is not compatible with this model. Because there are no extra buttons on the computer (which is a nice feature if the software worked correctly), you need to use the Fn keys to turn up and down the volume, brightness, fan, and most importantly enable and disable the wireless. The preinstalled software recognizes the wireless toggle button as the change desktop background button. I imagine they will fix this problem, but right now the only solution to keeping the wireless enabled is to uninstall the software. I'm sure they will fix this issue soon, but in the meantime that's just piss poor quality control for such an expensive laptop.So currently only the model NP900X4B-A02US has support and suggests Easy Settings v. 1.1.1.4This laptop is model NP900X4C-A03US which does not have any support options.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS LAPTOP UNTIL THIS ISSUE IS RESOLVED=======================UPDATE=========================In a bizarre turn of events the issue has been resolved. The solution may pertain to other issues so please read on. Two weeks after the issue arose and after reinstalling and uninstalling the exact same software as instructed by the four different chat help reps I installed it a fifth time. This time the software installed a different version than the versions that had installed before. I had read that there is a single easy settings software for every machine. Clearly it identifies your components and installs the appropriate version. Clearly it was not able to identify my laptop correctly. If you have issues with any of the easy settings components I imagine you must just reinstall the software until it finally works. I wish I could tell you I could think of some unique set of conditions I installed it under, but I can't think of anything I did differently than the previous 4 times.With this in mind and the software working once again, I would upgrade this laptop to 4 stars - not 5 because the viewing angle really does suck on this machine.

So one could say I know my way around laptops and W7.The issue: Samsung fastboot takes over the W7 settings, turns OFF the wireless adapter, and it cannot be turned ON either from FnF12 (pressing key gives a wireless & bluetooth image, both greyed out and un-switchable), or from the \"Advanced Power Settings\" when going the battery icon route. Because that BTW reverts to \"Samsung Eco Mode\" even when switched to another power setting followed by immediate reboot (yes, tried that too). The only way to turn on the wireless adapter is to go to \"Samsung Fastboot\" and turn it on under Advanced Settings.
