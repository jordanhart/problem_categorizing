I bought my 1737 right out of basic training for $1200 big ones (Along with an old block zune!) and have toted it on several deployments from the deserts of the middle east to the jungles of south america and other than a few maintenance repairs it never once let me down.

My new studio after having it for 4 years, being used every single day for games, or online browsing has worked GREAT. and today, FINALLY something has failed on it. The battery! Ive used it pretty rough for the last 4 years, i have even dropped it from the top of my bed to the floor on accident once and it still has never given me any problems, idk if its luck or what. I only noticed one difference between this studio on amazon and mine.. my processor is a 2.20GHz t6600. I would reccomend this laptop to anybody because of its reliability. The only DOWNSIDE to this laptop is the shitty speakers and the keyboard can act funky at times ! And the mouse pad is junk! but everybody i know has a mouse!", "Date": "August 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "S. Nitschke \"Today's good deed is tomorrow's ...", "ReviewID": "RLBF1V3Z7PGJU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this computer in October of 2009.  With this being my first Dell computer ever I must say it is a definite step up from my former computer.  I haven't had any issues with the computer itself, but with some of the software that was put on it (McAfee Security...I hate that stuff).  I do A LOT of typing, and never had any issues with my keyboard.  I use a USB mouse, so I cant say much on the touch pad.I originally got this computer because I played online video games, along with web surfing, email, and word processing.  I still have no issues with playing the game (World of Warcraft) though I don't personally play, my niece has played on this computer and it still performs wonderfully!I cant talk it up enough and if I could get a second one for a reasonable price I would do it in a heartbeat.  I want to have a second computer for my part time job and this would be my first choice.  (Only want a second computer so I can work and the family can do their own things).I doubt I will ever have another name brand other than Dell unless things would change in the company.  I love this computer and I have had it for two and half years with NO ISSUES!", "Date": "March 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Unique", "Author": "Paul Connelley", "ReviewID": "R34GXBTM5S948N", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is and looks like a very special one of a kind laptop.It just more unique and ausome then the ones we have in 2013.Its just the design of it.It been obsolete though because of dell.When I bought this it looks just like a sleek and advanced,stylish,and more of a all around basic and advanced use laptop.People you need to stop saying it has windows 7 and Windows 8.Because its to old to support those Operating systems.You can't even put a Pentium dual-core processor because the system won't support it because its over 6 years old.It would fail if you tried.This laptop needs to back in use by dell because I think if they would you use the same design and manufacture them but building updated components on it then maybe you can put windows 7 and 8 on it.Also you can use the new processors today if you wanted to.", "Date": "October 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Software = Good - Housing = Bad", "Author": "Michael Alston", "ReviewID": "R1GH0Q851ERCGF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've owned this laptop for about 2 years and I would have to say that overall it suited our needs, but its also lacking a lot in physical integrity.The Good:I owned the T9400 Version of this laptop so it was very fast and performed great when watching Movies and playing games. It's also fast enough to run Adobe After Effects, which is a very high demand video editor. I've only had to completely restore the computer once, mostly for maintenance reasons. Otherwise just having a decent anti-virus program and keeping away from junk sites or downloads has kept it running just fine. I loved the huge screen! Also it has an excellent selection of external ports, just about everything you'll ever need. Plenty of USB Ports, VGA port, and my favorite was the Flash Card Port. Also the HDMI Port was great for quickly hooking it to a LCD or Plasma TV for great picture and sound. Lastly it has the upgraded version of Windows movie maker which is just about the best \"User friendly\" Movie editor other than \"I Move\" on Mac.The Bad:All that said I would have to say that my biggest complaints are about the housing and mechanics of the laptop. For one, anywhere some oils from our hands got on it, like the mouse pad or sides of the monitor, little marks started to appear and spread. Its as if the oil is corrosive and eats away at the finish. This has greatly reduced the resell value and overall appearance of the laptop. Also the Monitor Hinges are very poorly designed. Not long after purchasing it started to come loose and now we have to manually push it back into place on the left side. Other parts of the laptop are starting to snap out of place constantly. Also this is a very heavy laptop, perhaps its just the model I have. And like mentioned before the speakers a crap, but this is my first laptop so maybe its normal. The Media controls are nice but are very hard to see until after you touch them. Couple that with an UN-lit Keyboard and this laptop is terrible in the dark. Like I said most of my complaints are regarding the physical integrity, but we were pretty hard on it since we travel a lot.Summary: All in all I would say Dell did a good job on the software, but not so much the housing of the laptop. This would probably be a great item for a person that is not very mobile, but doesn't want a full Desktop PC. Less movement would solve the housing problems, and external speakers would solve the sound problem. So, Keep it in one place, and you're good to go!", "Date": "April 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Should of done my research...", "Author": "SuperSavvy928", "ReviewID": "RTCN61NC0R49M", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this computer for school.
