{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A great performance laptop", "Author": "Anthony Palombo", "ReviewID": "R13A3HCTN6WIH8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop comes certified to work with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Suse Linux. It came with Windows 7 Professional and I did a clean install of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.3 over it (bye bye Windows), and it's been running great and very very fast ever since. A note regarding Linux - if you want to watch Blueray movies then this capability will mostly be gone because Blueray is \"too\" proprietary for Linux. I say mostly because old versions of Blueray are supposed to work when the system is configured properly, but most certainly newer versions can not be made to work. Since this laptop is meant to be a performance workhorse the Blueray matter should be of no issue - of course if using Windows then you'll have Blueray capability if the Blueray player is ordered with it. Another nice feature of this laptop is it comes with the Intel Centrino N 6300 wireless card, which is a 3x3 antenna card (3 transmit, 3 receive) - this means if you have a 3x3 router (like the HP MSM 460) then you'll get up to 450 mbps throughput. I get the full measure of 450 mbps throughpout but the real effective  throughput is limited by the ISP provisioned bandwidth (in my case FiOS 150dn/75up mbps). Finally, a 3 year warranty is a plus considering the $2K+ cost of this laptop.", "Date": "January 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008C7B61K"}}
