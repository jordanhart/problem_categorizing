{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Frustrated with Lenovo support", "Author": "Get Lost", "ReviewID": "R3445C3U0MZNQF", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been a Lenovo T-series user for about a decade, going through 4 T-series laptops for work.  I finally bought a personal laptop for myself, because the soon-to-be released T440 is trying to be something it's not, which is an ultrabook (no more ultrabay, touch screen, internal battery).  So I thought the T430 would be the last of it's kind for traditionalists who like Windows 7 better than 8, and like that this laptop can be upgraded with a 2nd hard drive, etc.However, my complaint is that I received a model with a noisy fan.  Search for \"T430 noisy fan\" on a web search engine and you'll find several others who had the same issue as me.  The noise is an extremely annoying high pitched whine, like a jet turbine.  So after having it for a day, I had to send it into Lenovo support.  Per their instructions, I removed the hard drive and replaced the hard drive cover.They shipped it back a few days later and seemed to have fixed the fan issue (if you get a noisy fan model, demand that they replace the fan with a quiet fan.  There's nothing that can be done with software to fix it).  However, when I tried putting the hard drive cover back on, the screw wouldn't thread back into the laptop.  I called Lenovo again, simply asking them to send me a 5 cent replacement screw.  They refused, saying the \"Hard drive cover is cosmetic\", even though it's the piece that prevents my hard drive from falling out of my computer.  Hey, the hood on my car is cosmetic, but if a car shop gives it back to me with a broken latch, I expect them to fix it.I ended up taking a screw from an old Lenovo which was the proper width, but too long, so I had to use a hack saw to get it to the correct length.  Even though they have a 30 day return policy (through Lenovo) I decided to keep the laptop for now because I didn't want to go through the hassle of buying another laptop, but I'm unhappy with the frustration I've went through after buying a brand new machine.On the plus side, the lighted keyboard is nice and I don't mind the new chick-let style keys, though I wished they kept the page up / down and Home / End keys in the same place they were located on the T410 / T420.", "Date": "October 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Noisy fan! thumbs down", "Author": "Kedar", "ReviewID": "RZC0R2K7YRS03", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Performance wise this laptop is good except it has one major flaw - its fan is always on and is too noisy.This is a known issue and Lenovo recommends a BIOS update to fix it.

And that's fine. I've been living off of $500-below laptops ever since I had my first one in college, and while they've had their issues, the issues were minor and hardly enough to push me into getting a more expensive PC or switching over to a Mac.I had been using an HP, which ran smoothly but was having some battery trouble, and instead of replacing the battery like I should have I decided to reward myself instead with a $700 Lenovo T430. It's a well-respected make, and the T-series are known for being reliable and \"great business laptops,\" etc.What a mistake. As soon as it came out of the box, the T430 was already slower than my two-year old HP that I bought at a Black Friday special (to give you an idea of how cheap it is). I use my computer as much as the next millennial, and usually I like to just close the lid and let it sleep instead of shutting the computer down altogether. Well, it takes two full minutes after I reopen the lid to get it back to form, especially w.r.t. Google Chrome, which lags horribly. I have to sit though an excruciating series of \"Chrome is Not Responding\" messages until I can get back to writing that email I was working on, or whatever.I feel stupid for having bought this now. 4 GB RAM are just not enough, and now I'll have to add RAM and probably also replace the hard drive with an SSD. I read online that the computer gets a lot faster once you do that, but the whole point is that you shouldn't HAVE to do that, after you've paid $750ish for a supposedly good/fast/reliable computer.There are other problems. For instance, the two-finger scrolling feature sometimes decides not to work. Just like that. Thirty seconds later, it works fine again. It's maddening. All I ask for is a fully functional touchpad and a Google Chrome that doesn't bonk, plus like a Word Processor. My needs are simple. This is why I use a PC. And it's why sh**ty Black Friday-deal laptops have worked fine. Apparently the $300 extra you pay for the Lenovo can't even buy you that.", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Superb!", "Author": "Skibane", "ReviewID": "R3T0EN9DH0JIRQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1.
