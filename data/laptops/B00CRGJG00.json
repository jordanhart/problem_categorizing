{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great specs for price!", "Author": "BadgerBlue", "ReviewID": "R20LQYR6SQVXFB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been through numerous Dell laptops, but the shell is a big improvement over the cheap bulky ones of recent past.  It's only 1 inch thick.  Still plastic, but much sleeker.  Inside the core i3 and 6gb of memory are enough for every day tasks (isn't that what 99% of consumers do)?  I was hesitant about Windows 8 but it's not as bad as they say.  You can still use the traditional desktop view where 90% of the time it feels just like Win 7.  Yes it takes a bit to get used to, but after a few uses you will be fine.  For an everyday budget laptop that can easily meet the demands of all but the super power users (i.e. gamers or graphic artists), this is a GREAT system.  Don't wast time on the cheaper ones with the lesser processors if you can get this for $400.  Oh yeah last point - the track pad is much better.  It feels your finger tap to click and scrolling motions.  Not a cheap imitation, this one really works flawlessly.", "Date": "August 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good deal!", "Author": "SURENDER", "ReviewID": "R39OYUOTPDQHYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this 6GB RAM/i3 laptop for $399 !!it  works good.

However, I got this to replace a Macbook so it definitely does not compare when it comes to the feel and coolness of a more expensive laptop. There is nothing fancy about this Dell laptop. Even clicking the buttons makes a cheap plastic-y sound.But for browsing the internet, video chatting and basic Microsoft Office applications, it's perfect.The screen is large for this price point, in my opinion, but very reflective.  Also, I was very surprised by the sound quality of the built in speakers, pretty good.  The laptop is also pretty thin and light.One thing I could have REALLY DONE WITHOUT, all the bloat-ware. I didn't appreciate feeling pushed to open a Microsoft account and use all their products/applications.  It took days for me to get it all removed and to disable all those weird features.Like I said, good all around laptop for this price point and it meets my basic computer needs.  This laptop is probably great for a student on a budget or pretty much anyone looking for a basic and good quality laptop.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Poor support", "Author": "Christian De Freitas", "ReviewID": "R1V3O0K1CGVLSM", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This laptop is full of spam, hard to remove all of it, called dell and the support is horrible. since its a 3rd gen intel core i3 the price should drop.the 4th gen intel core i3 is priced similarlyhttp://amzn.to/1fXsxf9theres no reason to stick with dell customer service, the only downside of the 4th gen core i3 is that theres no bluetooth", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop", "Author": "Lance L.

Intrusive monitoring from Dell.  I don't need Dell to track my notebook.", "Author": "CT", "ReviewID": "R3R9DOHOYBK6MY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Dell Notifications has been installed and enabled by default on the notebook.  You get frequent unwanted Notifications from DELL.  I'm not sure if it could be turned off.  The Notification tries to force a service tag on my notebook even though I never requested one because my notebook was in perfect health.  It also schedules periodic hardware scans and sends the result back to Dell by default.  Notification pops up every now and then bugging you to do things like backing up, enabling hardware scans (if you have disabled it), etc. which is extremely annoying.  I'm betting this is true for all Dell notebooks.  I'll never buy another Dell again.", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer for my needs.", "Author": "Lorentsen", "ReviewID": "R17PDIT32WI7K0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this computer refurbished and got a very good buy.I have no complaints whatsoever ever, the Inspiron 15 has worked flawlessly.

The first problem is that Dell inadvertently shipped me two computers one of which I shipped back as I hadn\u2019t paid for it. I\u2019ve paid for two years of a service contract with technical support. Of the many times I contacted them for help I had to describe how Dell wound up with my computer not being listed by my service tag because Dell mistakenly listed the sent back computer to me. So before I could get help I spent a lot of time straightening out this problem before they would resolve my computer problems. Each time I was promised that the records were fixed and that the next time I might call I wouldn\u2019t have to resolve this mix up again. So every time I called I had to waste all that time resolving the issue again with a promise each time that the issued had been resolved.Yesterday after resolving this problem again I was told that I would need a new hard drive. The computer was only shipped to me on 10/2/2011. Obviously an expensive computer by a well-respected computer manufacture should last more than a little over two years regardless of the warranty. Had the computer broke after four or five years I would have had no problem with buying a new one. This is sort of like the car engine that blows up one month past the warranty. I was told by the female in customer care who finally straightened out the service tag issue that Dell would warranty my hard drive. When I was transferred back to Technical support the technician told me that Dell would not warranty the hard drive. I then had him connect me to the manager and was refused again. Obviously I will never buy a Dell product again.", "Date": "January 11, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CRGJG00"}}
