{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very Impressive", "Author": "R. Layne \"Luv2Read\"", "ReviewID": "R2CS4E0IS5MQD5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not a gamer so this review may not be helpful to those who want a computer to play games.I have worked as a professional software developer/architect for 17 years.  I started with MSDOS 2.0 and have ridden the Microsoft wave all the way through Vista 64 and I had a few years with UNIX.  I have personally owned or worked with computers from Dell, HP, Compaq, IBM.  I have heard of Apple products but for the most part dismissed them as more toy than tool.  (I was not alone in this perspective.)  I like Microsoft but after working with it for the better part of 20 year I decided to look at something different.I never thought I would purchase an Apple yet here it is.  I am impressed to say the least and I see Apple as a serious tool that also makes a cool toy.Pros:Lightweight - Probably the lightest laptop I've ever worked with or ownedSolid - Normally when you get laptops at 15.4 or larger, chassis flex becomes evident as you can see them bend and they creak.  Yet because of its single piece construction and light weight aluminum the MacBook feels good when you need to move it.  I doesn't creak and there is no noticeable bend when lifted.Battery Life - It just keeps going, and going, and going...  Actually I am seeing up to 4 hours life on the fully charged battery.  My previous computer never surpassed 1.75 hours.Size - It is very thin and carrying it around is very comfortable.  I had a 17\" and while I like the large display its uncomfortable to carry like a book.Magnetic Clasp - When closing the lid the owner is rewarded with a very solid thump instead of a \"creak\" \"clack\" that you hear from so many other laptops that use a plastic display and mechanical clasp.  Opening the monitor is equally a pleasing.  You place you thumb under the lip and lift.  The laptop may slide a little on smooth surfaces but the lid comes up smooth and controlled.Keyboard - This is a great piece of work.  Does it have \"Home\", \"Page Up\", \"Page Down\", the legendary \"Any\" key?  No.  Doesn't need it.  A little research and practice and you will find that these \"missing\" keys are functions of the keyboard and I don't miss them at all.  Secondly the keyboard \"key-float\" (that rattle you hear when you lightly stroke your finger back and forth over a laptop keyboard) is almost completely non-existent.  So when you're typing it doesn't sound like your wadding up crinkly plastic and you don't annoy your neighbors.  The key throw is short but very pleasant.  Another thing I like about the keyboard is that you don't feel like you will break the keyboard if your touch is a little heavy.Display - The display is a work of art.  No only does it look good, but flex has been reduced to almost nothing.  It feels very solid and you don't feel you need to worry about tilting the screen from the corner.  The glass cover over the LED lit LCD display is awesome.  You can actually clean the screen without LCD screen colors distorting.  Not to mention that is automatically dims in low light and the key board lights up in the same low light conditions.  that's a nice touch.  The display brightness is every bit as bright as my desktop LCD display in strong light.Touch Pad - Any who has tried to use the touch pads on other computers (I hate them generally) will love this touch pad.  It works like the iPhone (except scrolling is reversed for obvious reasons - you're not actually touching the screen).  The touch is light and very smooth.  Making the entire touch pad the button is brilliant, it took me almost no time to get use to it and now I nearly push a hole through the Dell touch pad before I realize I have to click the buttons.  I have no trouble with inadvertent touch that moves my cursor away from where I'm typing.Quiet - I have yet to hear the fans.  It makes me wonder if they ever work.DVD Superdrive - Finally!  No cup holder comes sliding out of the side of my laptop.  Just simply slide the disc in and your done.  It operates like the CD player in a car.  It is easy to eject from the screen or a key on the keyboard.Fit and Finish - The best I've ever seen.  The only thing I've seen is a very slight misalignment of the Express Card/34 slot door.  But you really have to look close to see it.Operating System - WOW.  Fast, no anti-virus, stable: it just works.  I won't get too much into the OS but I will say that once I understood how Apple likes things done OS X is very appealing.  Not to mention that it sleeps and wakes up faster than anything I have ever worked with.  Open the monitor and it's sitting there saying \"come on, I'm tired of waiting for you\".Built-in Accelerometers - Not sure what they're good for, but they're cool.  Like the iPhone the MacBook Pro has three accelerometers.  There is an Stanford Laptop Orchestra uses MacBook Pros to make music using these accelerometers.No Fresh Air Openings - I really dislike fresh air ports on the bottom of laptops.  They are easily plugged and they suck fuzz and dust into the heat sinks.  With my previous computers the fresh air ports were placed underneath the computer right where it sets on your legs.  The result was you ran a big risk overheating the computer.  The MacBook Pro pulls the cooling air through the keyboard and therefore has a smooth bottom making it far better to place on you lap.CONS:Chassis - While it is a brilliant piece of engineering there are a couple very minor issues.One:  Always pick the computer up with both hands.  While this is true of all laptops you want to last, it's a little more important with this one.  The metal around the ethernet port has been machined very thin which was necessary to fit the large jack in the rather narrow side of the laptop.  So if you have the monitor open and grab the laptop with you left hand and your thumb over that jack you could dent the metal around it.  It doesn't warp or twist the whole chassis, it's too strong but you could see a small indention in a otherwise straight piece of metal.Two:  The metal in the Battery/Hard Drive Cover is very thin and sometime appears to hang below lip of the chassis.  You really have to look to see it and it isn't all the time.  I don't think is is warped or bent, but just the natural flexibility of aluminum.Touch Pad Click - While I absolutely love the touch pad (in fact I only use a mouse anymore when I am programming on it because of the nature of the software).  If you try to click at the top of the pad (nearest the screen) the force required to click goes up quite a bit.Price? - Not really a Con.  Some have complained about the price.  Three and half years ago I paid $5700 for a Dell 9100 laptop (All the bells and whistles, Window XP Pro, Office Pro, the works).  It has been a great computer that has been put to pasture and my family uses it.  I've only had two problems with it.  The dreaded mexican jumping keys (a key flies off the keyboard after you press it down while typing; AKA broken key) Dell replaced the keyboard without any trouble and the hard drive crashed and needed to be replaced.  The Dell computer when new cost more than twice the MacBook Pro does today and the only thing it has over the Mac (old age and technology not withstanding) is it's 1920 x 1200 pixel display compared to the Mac's 1440 x 900 display.  If I were to order the most power 15.4 laptop Apple sells today, I would still pay half the price of the Dell and the Apple does much more and has better quality overall.To summarize this is an accomplishment that the engineers, designers, and developers should feel proud.  There is some room for improvement but these improvements are at a level that other laptops have to improve a great deal just to achieve Apple's shortcomings.I could go on further but I think this is enough.  Apple has truly developed a great product in both hardware and software and I recommend it highly.", "Date": "December 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worth the Extra Money Compared to MacBook", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "RJEIFE17ZKIWV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Apple's site and other reviews provide the essential information on what was upgraded in this new MacBook Pro (two graphics systems; machined from solid aluminum; new industry-standard DisplayPort video out; new trackpad; other minor changes/upgrades).But why get this computer rather than the much less expensive MacBook that appears almost identical?1. The MacBook LCD display is poor. It is not just a smaller version of the MacBook Pro LCD display. It has washed-out blacks, poor contrast, limited viewing angles, and less vibrant colors. This is a huge difference. I confirmed this with a side by side comparison in the Apple Store (and the store staff member agreed), and you can find further discussion at gizmodo dot com (gizmodo.com/5063492/macbook-and-macbook-pro-dual-review).2. The MacBook Pro's excellent new graphics chip (NVIDIA GeForce 9600M GT) can be used to speed up all operations (not just graphics) when the new Apple operating system (Snow Leopard) is released in January. This is not confirmed, but there is substantial discussion online suggesting this is the case. The 9600M is essentially a 32 processor computer (running at 120 gigaflops). So, a MacBook Pro will actually gain in speed over time. The MacBook does not have a separate graphics card that can work this way.3. MacBook Pro graphics are twice as fast as MacBook graphics, so if you do anything visual with your computer (digital photography, video, games, etc.) then everything will run much more quickly and smoothly. Some games that are just barely playable on the MacBook become fun and seemless on the MacBook Pro.4. The MacBook Pro has a firewire port (omitted from the new MacBook).5. The MacBook Pro has an expansion card slot (really handy for adding a memory card reader or 3G roaming internet).So, for the extra $400 (MacBook 2.4 GHz vs. MacBook Pro 2.4 GHz) you get a lot of extras that you will notice and use. And you will avoid the poor LCD on the MacBook. You are still stuck with the highly-reflective glass screen (if my eyeglasses can get anti-reflective coating, then why not this computer screen?), however, so it's only four stars until they solve that problem.", "Date": "October 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "New macbook, new hardware, awesome", "Author": "D. Perkins", "ReviewID": "R1PXY1HA39YG2Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Apple is notorious for constantly updating their products, more or less to keep up the status quo on their products.  The new Macbook Pro is no exception.  This beautifully constructed laptop is a work of art in many ways in which i will detail.SCREENThe MBP has had a beautiful screen for as long as i can remember and this new model is no exception.  LED lit means that it is \"instant on\".  when you open the lid, there is no warm up time like there is with other screens like LCD ect.  The colors pop and are extremely vibrant and true.  If you have seen an older MBP screen, you've seen them both, kind of.  The new screen is all glass.  The glass extends to the very outer edge of the lid, leaving no empty space.  Simply put, you can't find a better screen, not even on a Sony machine (and i love sony also).KEYBOARDThe new MBP has an updated keyboard.  The first thing you will notice is that the keys are black as apposed to the old silver.  The black adds a nice touch because it accents the silver case.  If you ask me, the old MBP had too much silver.  EVERYTHING on the machine was silver aluminum.  Don't get me wrong, i loved the old MBP, but this is just one step up.  The Keyboard is also backlit so when you are in a darker environment, the keys light up, helping you see anything and everything on the keyboard.  The Keyboard is absolutely beautiful on the machine and adds a nice touch overall to the look.TRACKPADI find it weird that i can put an entire section on a review about a laptops trackpad, but this is undoubtedly necessary.  The new trackpad is ALL glass and there is no button---per say.  In reality the entire trackpad is the button.  They took off the button on the bottom and extended the trackpad down to give you more real estate.  Apple spent months designing this trackpad and i have to give them major credit for that.  recently me and my friend were looking at laptops at Circuit City, and one thing we did was go through every single laptop and look at it's trackpad.  It is absolutely amazing how much time and effort company's DON'T put into designing their trackpad, when in my book, it is a HUGE factor.  The coefficient of friction on this trackpad is exactly what it needs to be.  not too rough, not too smooth, just right.  I absolutely love the MBP trackpad and think it is something apple needs to be commended for.GRAPHICSApple and NVIDIA joined up and came up with a new video card for this MBP.  The MBP actually has 2 graphics cards in it.  One that is integrated, and one that is dedicated.  The integrated graphics is NVIDIA instead of the old intel, so it is immensely better.  The dedicated card (which can be easily switched on) is a powerhouse and almost puts a MBP in line with other gaming machines, almost.  Needless to say, this notebook will do just about whatever you want it to do graphics wise, gaming, video editing, photo editing, you name it, it will do it pretty easily.  no worries here.OVERALLoverall this laptop is at the top of it's class and you might be wondering why i gave it 4 stars and not 5.....first and foremost, money.  I have to say that this is still overpriced.  You are paying for a collection of things like the operating system, graphics card, high end components and things like that, but come on apple, 2000 dollars is a lot to drop on any laptop, no matter what it is.  Is it worth it? without a doubt yes, and that is why apple can jack up their prices, but at the same time, it seems like they are kind of taking advantage of us, especially in the economic slum we're in right now.  Maybe i am just cheap (which i don't think most people would classify me as that) but that seems a little high to me.  And another thing.  what is up with the new display port?  i have a 46 inch samsung tv and i will be hooking it up to my MBP but the cable is 100 dollars!!!! and that is just to dual link dvi----i still have to buy a dual link dvi to HDMI adapter after that. Ugh.  apple (along with other company's...cough cough monster cables) is completely ripping us off on their cables and that makes a difference in my outlook on the big picture.CONCLUSIONThe new MBP is absolutely stunning in every aspect of its design.  Apple continues to wow us, and they will also continue to prosper and grow.  I will be enjoying my new Macbook pro and i hope this review helped you in any questions you might have had.  It is an investment that will live for a long time and will be greatly enjoyed every day.  good job apple.", "Date": "October 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "The Good, The Bad, and the Shiny", "Author": "Robert M. Brown", "ReviewID": "R21IXVOXMC9GO1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The new MacBook Pro has some significant advantages over the old one.  The new case design is attractive and solid.  The keyboard is crisp and responsive.  The hard drive is as easy to access as on every other notebook on the market (as opposed to requiring complete disassembly of the machine with the old model).  The new NVIDIA 9600 graphics adds a lot of 3D horsepower.There are some significant drawbacks as well.  The video output for connecting an external monitor is only compatible with one monitor at the moment.  Connecting to the kinds of monitor that people actually own will require the purchase (and carrying) of an additional $30 adapter.  Or two, if you need to connect to both VGA and DVI monitors.The new MacBook Pro actually has two video adapters; the NVIDIA 9400 and 9600.  The system uses the 9400 by default, which is less powerful than the 9600 but uses less power.  The 9400 is an integrated adapter without its own memory; it uses 256MB of the system RAM.  The problem is that it uses that 256MB RAM even when the system is using the 9600 adapter.  In other words, these laptops effectively have 256MB less RAM than the previous generation.The new display is very clear and sharp, at least as good as the previous generation's screen.  It is also covered with a pane of glass and is very, very shiny; much shinier and more reflective even than the previous generation's 'glossy' screen.  If the lighting conditions in your work environment are exactly right, the screen looks wonderful.  If there is any light behind or above you, the screen acts as a mirror and the glare and reflections can be very annoying.The new MacBook Pro is a wonderful computer, but it is not a clear upgrade from the previous version and the mirror finish of the new screen means that no one should buy this computer without actually trying it first.", "Date": "October 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "PC to Mac Convert and lovin' it!", "Author": "OPsDad \"New Media Consultant\"", "ReviewID": "RZVBPREDQN47E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am a long-time IT professional with enough certifications (mostly Microsoft) to make a large can of alphabet soup, and this is my first Mac.  I had played with a few of them here and there years ago, and never saw what people liked about them.  The closest I ever came was back in the late '90s when I was tempted to run Windows on a PPC, but just about the time I was going to do that, Microsoft pulled their support for it from Windows, and that ended that.So, I was anti-Mac for quite a few years.  All that has changed.  I began to believe in the OS when Apple began to base it on Unix.  A solid, time proven technology that I trust.  The big thing that changed it all for me is VMWare.  For 70 dollars, I have the ability to run Vista Ultimate, XP, and Ubuntu Linux on OSX. My Vista Ultimate is my previous Dell (not a slouchy box, either).  It's a complete clone of my old computer.  Windows still shows it being a Dell!  Spooky.  Windows had it a 3.6 rating, and a retest of the VM on my Mac shows a 3.6 rating.  That alone earns 4 of the stars I give this machine.Now, here's another reason why I'm so happy.  I put Office 2008 on the MBP, and I seldom have any reason to even start the Vista VM anymore.  The last two times I did, it was only because I miss the great Vista solitaire game.  That earns the fifth star -- I'm not \"homesick\" in the least.  I think I'll be staying right here on planet Mac.  As a matter of fact, I got a MacBook for my wife, I liked this MBPro MB471LL/A so much!  Bought her the MB403LL/A.I use it with an external monitor about 90 percent of the time, so the glare of the glossy screen hasn't been an issue for me.  The built in screen is gorgeous, and I've not been in a situation where glare became an issue.This machine is truly desktop horsepower in a gorgeous carved aluminum notebook chassis.  I'm a very happy camper.", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Rus Healy", "ReviewID": "R2E6RNZS44RJ92", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "In more more than 25 years as a computer \"power user,\" this is the first Mac I have ever owned. I had never considered Macs to be relevant to me in several key ways, including the proprietary, non-Intel hardware and lots of \"funky things\" about the old Mac OS. However, I had also become dog-tired of the Wintel boondoggle--machines needing to be rebuilt on a regular basis, blue screens, virus hassles, etc, etc. Supporting family computers was even more of a pain. \"Dad, what does this error message mean?!\" <sigh> Clearly Macs are now a viable alternative for technical business users (okay, they have been for a while), so I took the leap even though the hardware is very pricey, competitively speaking.I'm absolutely delighted with this purchase. Everything just works. Although I'm still finding my way around in some areas, I am reveling in the joy of a human-use-oriented user interface. I installed VMware fusion based on my comparisons between it and Parallels, and on my experience with VMware on other platforms. I exported my work machine with VMware Converter and imported it into Fusion. Works great. Performance is at least as good as it was on the old machine (2.4 GHz Core 2 Duo, 4 GB RAM)--and stability is much better. Integration of Windows apps into OS X is excellent using Fusion's Unity mode. I have not had to revert to my work-issued HP laptop even once since making the jump.The only challenge I had, and it was minor, was installing the RAM upgrade. I bought 4 GB RAM at the same time as the machine because I wanted to have the full memory capacity, especially for business apps and VMware Fusion. The upgrade isn't difficult (unlike the Mac Mini!), but it does take some care and two sizes of small screwdrivers to complete. Eight screws have to come out, and four of them are quite small. Take care to keep from dropping any of the smaller screws into the machine when you're reinstalling them. Cover alignment is also important to get just right, or the battery/HDD hatch doesn't close properly. As with any project, put all the screws in before tightening any of them.Unlike other reviewers, I have not found the high-glare, glass display to be a big problem. Glare is sometimes an issue but reorienting the machine slightly minimizes the inconvenience. The display is gorgeous, very much in keeping with the overall product design and quality. The glass trackpad is excellent, with intuitive, tunable multitouch features. The MacBook Pro runs much cooler, and quieter, than any laptop I've used over the last 5 or 6 years as well. The milled aluminum case is both rugged and attractive, as well as providing a great heat sink for the high-heat components.In the wish-list department, I would appreciate having more than two built-in USB ports, although I can migrate at least one device to FireWire to take advantage of that port. Also, the front edge of the base is slightly uncomfortably sharp for resting my hands or wrists. Lastly, I find it annoying to have to buy a $20+ adapter cable to connect an external VGA monitor. The adapter cable is also too short--but this isn't a review of the cable. All that said, these issues are not enough to drop my rating below five stars. This is an outstanding laptop. I like OS X enough that I have already added a Mac Mini as the family machine, to rave reviews among its three primary users. How can you beat that?", "Date": "November 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Go With The Pro!", "Author": "Brandie Woodward \"Spock4Pres818\"", "ReviewID": "R14GH6D5ZJDBYD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just purchased the pro yesterday at my local Apple Store.  I have had it for less then 24hrs so far, and I love it.  I was going to get the high end Macbook, and then at the last minute decided on the low end Pro upgraded with 4GB of Memory.  I am so glad I did.  It is so fast, and powerful.  The display is what made me make the final choice.  It is still very portable.  It weighs the same as my black macbook, and is thin.  It would be very easy to just to throw in my backpack and be on my way.  Also the firewire.  It was going to be the easiest way to transfer all my data from my old black macbook to the pro.  It only took and hour and a half, and I have all my information.  I didn't have to do anything, just started it up and began to play.  I didn't have Leopard on my old one, and I love it so far.  It is easy and the graphics and set up are great.  I love the stacks options, and the lighted keyboard.  I also love how the controls for the dashboard, screen brightness, keyboard brightness, and dvd controls, are right on the keyboard.  I was in between which laptop to get also because I am a casual gamer.  However, the salesman did tell me that I could still play some of the games on the Macbook.  The display alone is what I am enjoying the most.  It is definitely worth the extra money to get the pro.  Highly Recommended!  I didn't get it from Amazon, or order it.  I wanted to look at the computer before I purchased it.  From reading all the horror stories on the web about people receiving damaged, or broken laptops from both the Apple Store and other retail stores.  I would also recommend if you are going to get a mac, go to the Apple Store itself and get one if possible.  They are so helpful, and usually give you some kind of deal when purchasing one.  They will also set it up for you, but transferring all your information to your new computer is very easy to do by yourself.", "Date": "November 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Switching From a PC to a 17\" MacBook Z0G5 128GB SSD", "Author": "John Robertson", "ReviewID": "RPYM6PU8IIAXD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As of this writing, I've noticed that Amazon is mixing all MacBook Pro reviews together, regardless of the model you searched on to get here.  This is for the Z0G5, which is really just the 2.66GHz MB604LL 17\" with the 128GB Solid State Drive option.  Although I have used Apple/Mac products over the years, this is the first time an Apple has been my number 1 computing device.  I'm including details for those used to the PC environment, so those already familiar with Apple, please be patient, as I wanted to help weigh the pros and cons of switching from Windows.SUMMARY=======This, quite simply, is the nicest computer I have ever owned or used since starting with them in 1979.  It is not for everybody, if only because of price, but if there is something you are used to doing on Windows XP or Vista, this will probably do it, and do it faster and more reliably.GOOD====* Bootup/shutdown times - benchmarks are somewhat relative, but my 6 year old HP ze5400 P4, and 5 month old dv7-1130 core-duo, both will boot XP Pro to a usable state in just over 4 minutes, including effects of anti-virus software and initial browser launch.  Using the same licensed copy of XP Pro for this MBP, it boots in an incredible 25 seconds, every time.  This latter time is a full boot-up -- no hour glasses to wait through.  Shutdowns average around 4 seconds on the MBP, compared to around 30 to 45 seconds on the above mentioned Windows laptops.  You can also run Vista32/64, Linux, Unix, Sun and other OS using VMware Fusion, which runs within the Leopard OS -- this is absolutely terrific software, and if you set it to full screen, you will be hard pressed to tell if you are running a pure Windows OS, although Fusion will only devote one of the two Intel cores to Windows.  This latter point is quite amazing, when you read about how fast Vista boots on other MBP's (see other Amazon reviews in April 2009).  You can allocate the majority of the included 4GB of RAM and almost as much as the hard drive/SSD to these guest OS' as you want.  For just Leopard, the native OS, boot and shutdown times are comparable, and of course, that's for just that OS -- it has nothing to do with Fusion or guest OS's.* Screen - having just come from a near-new HP dv7-1130us, which also has a glossy 17\" screen, well, there is simply no comparison.  I'm not being an \"Apple snob\" here.  The MBP offers a much sharper and more colorful image.  Personally, the occasional glare is a worthwhile trade-off for the image quality, but I spent almost 2 hours in a local Apple store comparing the glossy vs. anti-glare side-by-side, and I almost picked the anti-glare, extra $[...] cost notwithstanding.  Unless you are really concerned about the final few pixels of 130dpi resolution which the glossy screen seems to bring out, or the pop-out color of the glossy, the anti-glare is just as good, and almost fully eliminates any trace of glare.  I could have been happy with either.  Also, when running XP in VMware Fusion, you can set the screen resolution to a ridiculous 5210 x 3200 ! (not native of course, but the even the 1920x1200 is better than any WSXGA+ screen I'm aware of)*  Battery power - I've only run on battery for 4 hours at a time, but I would estimate usable power for up to 6 hours, with occasional wifi use and uninterrupted word processing.  I do think it's POSSIBLE to get the 8 hr time, particularly if you get the flash hard drive and 2.66GHz processor, but you have to allow all power saving options, reduce screen brightness to absolute minimum, etc, so that practically, this is just a laboratory spec.  However, I have never owned a laptop that did better than 3 hours -- so this doubled that.* Keyboard -  I have come to really like the keyboard in only two weeks, although I do miss having a backspace key.  Apple die-hards may know something I don't, but without backspace or an 'end' key, I find I am re-positioning the cursor a lot.  However, the track pad almost compensates for this.  When set for single-tap, this is the best track pad I've ever used.  I never accidentally select or click items anymore.  Right click is done with two-fingers, and is less effort than actual 'right-clicking'.  Windows hotkeys, such as alt-tab, ctrl c, ctrl v, etc. work when running XP.  I dislike the sharp edge towards the front of the laptop, and I'm a little surprised that Apple picked form over razor-blade-function by not beveling this.  But, this thing is a MacBook Air wannabe - it is very thin, and the pressure on the wrists still isn't as bad as other laptops I have used.  Too bad they didn't round it like the bottom edge.* SSD speed and response - currently, going to the Solid State Drive (NAND flash memory) is a $[...] premium to a 7200RPM hard drive, and that only gets you 128GB, of which you will have around 93 usable GB after getting your Mac with Leopard, iLife (included) and in my case, iWork loaded on it.  I keep photos and large files on a couple of external HDD's, and use an online backup service for really important business files, so trading off speed to lower capacity was very worthwhile.  In fact, I'm getting in the bad habit of not shutting down, but just putting the MBP to sleep and stuffing it in my bag while it's saving files -- it doesn't matter with SSD.  I've read about benchmarking SSD to HDD, small files vs big files, etc, etc.  Frankly, it was all meaningless once using it for real.  It's expensive now, but in 5 years, we will all be using SSD.* iWork and TextEdit - these will open .doc, .xls, .xlsx, etc.  You may not be able to edit all the features of Windows productivity software using Apple's own versions on their own, but you can still do many things with iWork, and you can always view any Microsoft-format files.  I was stunned at some of iWork's templates in Pages and Numbers.* You can share files between the Leopard and Windows OS (or any other guest OS) using shared folders.  You can also select to share files between different users or not.  This reminded me of using LAN shares.* Blue screen?  What's that??  Cheekiness aside, I can lock a Mac if I really try, but I have not done so yet on this or it's guest XP Pro OS.  Just a pleasure to use.NOT AS GOOD===========* 2.66GHz vs 2.93GHz for an extra $[...] - I'm being a little less than objective here, but looking at bench marks for the MacPro desktop, and talking with Apple Genius reps, I concluded the 2.93GHz processor only adds about 5 to 7% more usable processing power.  Feel free to offer your opinion.* Occasional lag - this has happened 3 times in two weeks -  I think this is due to the guest OS and tear-down of memory ranges.  It's not that obtrusive, but after getting used to the normal speed of the laptop, it's a bit of a surprise when it does happen.* Trash bin - no restore.  I have researched this and as incredible as it will sound to Windows users, you must manually restore unintended deletions yourself to whatever folder it came from -- not very helpful if you were typing/swiping quickly and didn't see where you unintentionally deleted something, or you are unfamiliar with Mac directory trees.  I have read some borderline-snob opinions about this, but it's a serious oversight that should not be joked about.  Most of us can identify with your hands tiring and inadvertently dragging a file or folder to the Trash.  Or sometimes small creatures known as children get a-hold of your treasured, $[...] device and use it as a Fisher-Price xylophone set.  I've been around some very brainy, Product Development Engineering-Fellow-types for years, and they are sometimes guilty of convincing themselves that removing features like this are explainable, acceptable, and only weak or stupid people would ever complain.  I guess I'm weak and stupid.  Frankly, I don't care.  Stupid people still seem to have a lot of money, (more than average, I have observed) so unless Apple likes perpetual 12% market-share, they should and will have to match certain, select attributes offered by competitors.  Again, if I'm wrong, I'd welcome being set straight on the issue.* Caution: Slippery When Dry - dry hands may not always grasp the super clean, smooth aluminum case, such as when going through airport X-ray security with hundreds of people jostling you.  I purchased the 3 year warranty because of this (although damage in such circumstances still may not be covered).* Warranty - at $[...], it's a little expensive.  I didn't know this when purchasing, but if you buy a 24\" monitor with the MBP on the same invoice, then the warranty also covers the monitor.  Except that, by definition, if you don't buy a monitor, then you're overpaying for a warranty that was priced to include one.* You may need new hardware and/or software - much of it which is not cheap.  One reason why VMware Fusion is so wonderful is you can load Window-based apps like Office and use your existing license.  Apple currently throws in iLife, and if using only Leopard, you don't typically need anti-virus software.  Some Apple hardware, like RAM, is designed only for Apple computers and does cost more -- even if you buy it from a third-party retailer.* ExpressCard 34 port - I really will need an eSATA port.  Unfortunately, reading some Apple reviews indicate that many commonly-available Express34 eSATA adapter drivers currently do not work reliably with the MBP.  I normally don't put too much into a few bad reviews here and there, but this does seem to be a genuine problem with the MBP as of late April 2009.  Driver updates may correct.* Price - it has to be said:  This is still just a computer.  Once you add truly comparable hardware, the price difference is not quite as disparate as many believe...perhaps $[...] for a premium, all-flash, all-day-battery Windows laptop to a $[...] MBP.  It's easy to fall into a trap of just counting USB ports, of how much DDR3 RAM you get, but I'm also referring to native screen resolution for a portable device, or color balance, stability, security vulnerability, etc.  If the MBP advantages are worth it to you, chances are you already know. I just broke the TFT display on my 5 month old HP dv7-1130us laptop, which also had a dual-core, 4GB DDR3 RAM, etc., which lead to this MBP purchase, but believe me -- and I'm not trying to jump onto an anti-Vista kick here -- the PC was painful to use.  Slow, alarmingly buggy, and poor legacy support.  Even after downgrading it to XP and upgrading to a 7200RPM HDD, performance was still slow slow - slower than an old single core, P4 with 1GB DDR RAM.  Specs aren't going to show you how fast this MBP boots.SOME FINAL THOUGHTS===================Use the MacBook Pro a little bit, and it grows on you all the more.  It seems different, but familiar hot keys, print screen, display and wifi settings, etc. are all still there.Apple still reminds me of how computers used to be in the 1980's -- things are already laid-out for you, and you do it the Apple way, and if you don't like it, get used to it.  PC, which really was a semi-open standard that began with Microsoft OS running of IBM PC's and PC clones, could be configured many ways.  Like so many things, what makes it open also makes it complicated, with clashing interpretations of standards.  Testing keeps systems reliable, but it is always the most expensive part of developing anything (I know, I can thank my career for it).  As a result, testing is usually where cost-cutting must be performed. Next time you curse Vista, remember, Microsoft engineers cannot solve issues due to third-party designers.  They will always be in reactive mode because Windows is relatively open.Apple chose to make the day-to-day settings for you, and telling many peripheral designers \"here's how your printer WILL talk to our computers\", etc.  It's potentially less flexible, and will slow third-party software and hardware development because it is more expensive to design and test with Apple.  Ironically, this is disorienting to us Windows users.  We are so used to controlling and setting everything, that an Apple computer seems too simple, and even that control is lost.  This really isn't the case though.  Virtually everything you can set in Windows can be manually set in a Mac.  But what I've found over the last 2 weeks is, why would you want to keep adjusting anymore?  I know it's their current slogan, so apologies, but the Apple really \"just works\".  There's no need to get into setup menus -- set once and forget.The last time I used iMac G3's or the original MacIntosh, I enjoyed them and remembered a few of my former PC-peers who said they would never switch back to a PC.  I'm not quite sure I'm ready to say that yet, but the MacBook Pro 17\" is the first Apple computer I'm willing to test that notion on.UPDATE:  Sept 15, 2009======================This is just a fantastic computer.  This is what impresses me almost daily:* Speed.  Same boot-up/turn-off times.  It does not gradually slow down with use like Windows.  Leopard and now Snow Leopard respond very fast. Running XP in the virtual is awesome because I almost never shut-down....I just suspend it.  In doing so, XP basically restarts in seconds.* Display -- Love using screen capture (command, shift, 4) -- much better than Print Screen.* RapidWeaver, Pages, Numbers - awesome templates.  Nice alternatives to the familiar ones we've seen for 10 years.* Ease of updates - fast, automatic and they do not bog machine down while loading.  They also are not co-dependent or prerequisite.  They just all download and install at once.* Battery life.  On just Leopard, 1/2 brightness screen, working on say a website while listening to iTunes, I get an honest 6 hours.  You probably could get 8 hours as I once got 7, but that's the dimmest setting and running only 1 app.  Still, I never take my adapter for the day.  The batteries outlast me.* Time machine is actually pretty cool.  I quite a back-up hound, and had just done what I always did with manual dragging of files to an external drive but TM works very well.Occasionally, there are problems, though in all honesty they do not cause much grief...but in the interest of disclosure, here's what I've found:* About 1 or 2 times per month, I have to Force Quit something.  Problem is usually seems due to a 3rd party driver or app.* Creating a new folder places it at the root of the directory tree, not in a subfolder you've highlighted.* No FW400 port.  I'm not sure...maybe there's an FW800-to-400 adapter.  But I could have used this a few times now.* Could not find a way to reverse the data series on a Numbers graph.  Geniuses at Mac store couldn't figure it out either.  There might be a way (in fact, it's there buy greyed-out...why??).* I dont' like iTunes lack of Realplayer-format support like .ra and .rmj, and greatly wish I could just see a directory tree of songs that I can shift-right-click and select.I don't know how Windows 7 will compare yet.  While it's still important for me to have the legacy support of XP on VM Fusion, I find that I'm using it less and less, almost completely relying on speedy Snow Leopard, Numbers, Word, TextEdit and Preview.  Dialog boxes are also rare (mercifully).  If you are really watching money (which would include 99% of us), obviously you'll have to wonder about those $[...] HP laptop blowouts you see.  However, after just playing around with the dv7 or my friend's HP d8000, I would really recommend you try a small MBP 13.3 or 15\" and at least compare, although it still does take time to learn certain keystrokes and features if you're only a Windows person.  Personally, though, I'm hooked.  I don't think I could go back to a plastic, bendable and slow laptop again.", "Date": "April 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Macbook Pro/Leopard convert", "Author": "JJ Casas \"jjcasas.me\"", "ReviewID": "R37LR6ZSNJJNKT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally took the bite and bought my first Apple computer. I'm a photographer and needed a new laptop since my old Gateway one was slowing down.. and since I've been eyeing an Apple since then, I finally purchased one after seeing the new one [I'm writing the review using it right now.]First things first: it just works. No clutter, no unnecessary backgrounds running in the background, simple and definitely sleek. I'm still getting use to the file management since it is different but otherwise, a lot of the programs I've used on Windows are available on Mac.:Design:It's really light for a 15\" laptop! And definitely thin too.. although it's not a cutting edge Macbook Air thin, it's definitely thin enough for easier transport. The all aluminum design is stunning. It's solid and feels sturdy. The keyboard is just right with its chiclet style keys and has enough tactile feedback.. not too loud either.:Screen:It's glossy and yes there is glare. Since I do photography, it's probably not the best screen to edit on but the colors and text and all is really good. It's a bright screen and makes pictures just look good.. too good as a matter of fact [opinion shared with another photography Joe McNally].:Trackpad:It's weird at first but it's really like a regular trackpad.. you place your hand as if on old trackpad and you'll naturally figure it out. Nothing really different but the space of the trackpad is really generous and I'm sure other manufacturers will follow suit.:Performance:I've yet to get bogged down after running Photoshop CS4, Lightroom, iTunes, and Firefox at the same time. So I have no issues just yet and will see later on if I'll need to upgrade to 4gb since I have the standard lower end version of the Macbook Pro.Overall, I'm glad I made the purchase and i'm sure this will last me quite a bit since I've had my Gateway [tablet] for over 2 years.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Beautiful computer, some mixed feelings", "Author": "Jacek R. Ambroziak", "ReviewID": "R1P8JNZVCBFHR7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is my first Apple computer ever. I am a software developer who mostly used Unix (Solaris) and Linux, rarely venturing into Windows land mostly for Nikon Scan and Photoshop. For a long time I believed Macs were for graphics/video designers, rather than hard core developers. The fact that I've seen lots of MacBooks at conferences such as Web 2.0 in SF, did not convince me enough: I attributed the widespread use of them to a fad, a certain \"style\" as in clothing. For me a computer is a \"knowledge worker's tool\" not a fashion statement. Another reason to stay away from Apple products has been high margin pricing. CPUs, GPUs, memory, disks, are quickly getting cheaper, and yet Apple sells these commodities like luxury goods. One can configure a beautiful Lenovo laptop with more horsepower for much cheaper (I've done it recently for a friend).So why do it?Here are MY reasons. 1) I needed MAC OS X to port some of my applications to the Mac, maybe go into iPhone development too. 2) I needed *some* laptop (for mobility) to replace my historic trusty Dell Inspiron 8000. Most of my work happens on a custom built desktop. 3) I am not much of a Windows fan and I am a bit tired of Linuxes; I wanted inspiration from something I haven't used before: to learn and expand knowledge/experience horizons.So that's where I am coming from...After 3 weeks of usage I can say the following (you will notice the mixed feelings from the title of this review)This is a computer of *stunning* beauty! It is a work of art: the screen, the keyboard, the body; it belongs on a permanent exibition at the MoMA. As such it is a joy to use and have around, it brightens my daily experience. And yet... why such a small screen resolution (1440x900) for a 15 inch screen?! Even my historic Dell from 2001 sported 1600x1200, great for working with text and hi-res photos. For this kind of money we should be getting higher resolution. I am not talking about numbers for numbers' sake: the font characters (even as I write this) are far from print quality, issues with anti-aliasing software may have something to do with this. Within the first couple of hours I practically decided to return the laptop because of how text looks 70% of the time. It is difficult to understand why Apple is saving on pixels here and impairs an otherwise great product. Is it because higher resolutions are reserved for even pricier models? Apart from the not-so-great-a-resolution (you may google around for other people's opinions on that), pricing is somewhat annoying too (and also discussed in many places on the Web). To connect an external monitor you need a $30 or $100 additional cable. To upgrade to a much more reasonable 4GB of RAM you'll need $100+ (or $300 if you want this commodity to have Apple sign on it :-) )But... I decided to keep the laptop. It is too beautiful, and I find MAC OS \"Leopard\" intriguing and a good experience. Then there are other pluses: the keyboard (back-lit w/ smooth key action), great network connectivity, convenient weight and dimensions, glossy screen (I don't have issues with reflections other reviewers mention). From the developer's perspective, I learn some good things and some not so good: apparently I can't just download my Java from Sun (say 32-bit Java 6); I have to live with what Apple endorses :-(Amazon/UPS delivery was fantastic, packaging is beautiful too: they both made for a very pleasant and exciting experience.Summary: I am not returning the laptop, I enjoy its beauty and functionality, but if I didn't need MAC OS for my planned work, I would have stayed in the higher value priced PC-land (eg. Lenovo + Ubuntu) where you can customize parameters better and avoid hefty margins.A FEW DAYS LATER: With MiniDisplayPort to DVI adapter (another $30) I connected the laptop to my 1600x1200 Sony LCD monitor. The text characters can still look pretty bad, eg. equals sign = with grey area between the horizontal segments. The bad news is that the higher resolution did not heal the issue: the good news: perhaps this is a software issue to be solved with a system update -- I hope.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "They finally converted me - Bye bye Vista", "Author": "TN_legend", "ReviewID": "RLK6OYNPQ09PD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first Mac - Ok let me start by saying I had been an Anti-Apple for years, I also work in IT and work a lot with Microsoft products still. So you wanna know what happened? Vista happened, as a big ex-Microsoft fan I bought a new laptop(HP) the week vista was released - I am not a new user so I understood there will be bugs and I need to give it time, same thing happened when they released Windows XP. ok after 1 + year of vista:  Man, system was still SLOW, ok no big deal added 2 more GB of memory but its still SLOW, programs not responding, and a security pop up pretty much for everything I tried to do. You click on a short cut and wait and wait and wait and finally it opens now the program is not responding so you have to wait and wait and wait. LIFE IS TOO SHORT!!! Then I heard Microsoft is releasing Windows 7, I was kinda pissed, I just spent $$ to upgrade to vista ultimate and now they are releasing a new windows?? that quick?? Fine so I went to Microsoft.com and get into Windows 7 beta. in the mean time I always owned blackberrys phones and it was the time to upgrade my old phone (blackberry curve), looked at the blackberry storm and man that thing stinks comparing it to the Iphone so I gave up and bought an Iphone - and WOW what a great experience I have had with it, the phone is just great and the APP store alone beats any phone out there - anyways going back to Windows 7 - Ok Microsoft can fool people naming it windows 7 but its Vista with some changes to the interface, same problems , very slow, and more system requirements than vista so basically if I want to experience Windows 7 at its best I have to buy a new laptop with a better graphic card. I then looked at the new Mac OS requirements - Yeah 256 MB of memory, you know what does that mean? it means people who bought an apple in 2000 can run the latest OS while for me to run Windows 7 I have to buy a new laptop that is less than 2 years old, same thing when vista was released couldn't run vista on a 2 years old Dell so had to buy a new laptop. that did it for me - I was done and decided to switch to mac and oh my god what a different experience I have had - It just AMAZING, I love every second of it - the system is so quit its hard to tell its running, it doesn't get hot like HP/dell did, the battery actually last longer than 2 hours. its just what a laptop should be like and the mac experience is as good as it could get, you turn this laptop on and the start time is less than 1 minute - you click on a short cut and the program runs immediately - I can run 9 different programs on it at the same time and not notice any slowness - try that with vista and you will see a nice blue screen + and no need to worry about virus or spyware.Yes this machine was more expensive but you know what? you really get what you pay for. Go to an Apple store and try a mac if you think about switching, trust me - you won't be sorry and you would never look back", "Date": "April 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing but not without it's flaws, those hoping to use bootcamp for Windows may be disappointed.", "Author": "TeamReveal", "ReviewID": "RNYSSVR6Z6XHH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my very first Macintosh computer. Earlier this year I bought an iPod Touch and I felt and still feel it is the most amazing pocketable gadget around, so since I was in need of a new computer I became highly interested in buying my first Apple computer and I went with the Late '08 Macbook Pro.After a month of daily usage I think I've had enough time to form an unbiased opinion of the computer's achievements and shortcomings.The first thing you'll notice is that the Macbook Pro's glass display is understatedly amazing. There is something about the glass enclosure that gives everything a certain purity. All screens have some type of film over them, whether that be gloss, matt, or simply a glass enclosure. Each of these films have a different refractive index of light and thus look different. What that means is that even if a manufacturer uses the same exact screen, the quality of the screen will be affected by what type of film protection they use.The Macbook Pro's screen is super bright if needed, and whites are blinding white while blacks are deep and rich. Colors come off as appearing very rich and watching blu-ray movies is a real treat (yes you read that right, more on that later) The viewing angles are also better than most laptops, but like any TN panel they are limited. Comparing this screen to my 2 year old Toshiba Satellite's screen shows that the Macbook Pro isn't as good at dithering colors. If I head over to the Lagom LCD test website, my Toshiba shows all of the steps in contrast for the various colors while the Macbook Pro blends in the last 2-3 squares. For daily average use and movie watching the Macbook Pro is easily king, there's no competition between the two so I'm not saying the Toshiba is better but it does dither colors better. This may be important to you if you are looking to do important detailed photograph work on the Macbook Pro, but then again I don't know of any professional who would do important work on any laptop screen.After a  month I feel pretty comfortable in OS X and I can definitely see why some people love it so much. The way OS X maximizes a screen to optimal width is superior to windows way of needlessly filling the entire screen. It did take a week or so to grow accustomed to this as I constantly wanted to fill the entire screen for no real reason, windows habit. Now I wish windows would maximize windows the way OS X does. I also love the fact that I can visit websites in safari without worrying about getting hit with a virus. In Windows I was constantly worried about visiting unknown sites because I didn't know if they had malicious code in them. More than once in Windows was I hit with messages from my virus scanner warning me that a website was trying to install malicious software. In Windows you have to \"browse defensively\" while in OS X you just have to worry about not downloading and installing malicious software. As far as the rest of the OS X GUI experience, I do feel that it is better than Windows but really, I don't feel there is anything wrong with Windows.If you're an unknowledgeable computer user who constantly has problems because of viruses then I believe you should get a Macintosh because in my experience most computer problems are virus related, something OS X is almost immune too. Personally, I'm a fairly knowledgeable computer user and have never actually had a virus in my computer, the closest is being warned by my virus scanner that a website was trying to install malicious software.Going back to hardware the Macbook Pro is an amazing engineering feat but you do pay for it. It is possible to get the same basic internal hardware for hundreds of dollars less. When I say same basic internal hardware I refer to the CPU and GPU which determine the performance, how fast, your computer can run. There are features in the Macbook Pro that you will not find in other notebooks. The magsafe power adapter is a neat feature, I absolute love the trackpad in OS X (hate it in Windows, but more on that later). Engineering the laptop to fit in an enclosure that's less than an inch thin is unnecessary and so is building it from a single piece of aluminum. No other manufacturer packs so much power in such a small and light frame because of the cost involved. It's these types of details that drive the price of the Macbook Pro up, but it's these details that ultimately lead the Macbook Pro to look and feel like a luxury laptop. You can buy a Toyota or you can buy a Lexus for much more. They both accomplish the same tasks but one delivers it in more style and luxury. If you're looking for the most raw power for your dollar then the Macbook Pro will disappoint but if you're looking for a laptop that looks and feels luxurious then you are in the right place.Now back to software and some of my disappointment with the Macbook Pro and OS X. I'm starting an online masters program this coming Spring and a website called Angel is not supported in Safari which means I'll have to log in to Windows to use it. They will also be using a few Windows only applications which means more Windows. I will also have to turn in assignments in under Microsoft's Word and Excel extensions and as I previously only used windows my copy of Microsoft Office is for Windows only so I'll most likely have to incur another expense and buy this for OS X. I have bought VMWare so I can run Windows within OS X but I am a bit disappointed with its sluggish performance.  I also like watching blu-ray movies, this works under boot camp and by hooking up an external blu-ray player, playing video games is also another windows activity. Sure you can play games under OS X but Windows is superior for game availability and performance. One unexpected disappointment is that I feel OS X's font smoothing is not as good as Windows. Text in Windows looks sharper and is easier on my eyes, I've change some settings in OS X's appearance tab to improve things but I feel text looks better in Windows. Some people tell me they feel text is easier on the eyes in OS X for them so this will be a very personal preference for you.So why did I buy a Mac when I needed to do so many windows only activities? One is because I was enamored with the iPod Touch's abilities and because of the amazing screen on the Macbook Pro. Most importantly, I was hoping to run Windows on the Macbook Pro just like I would on any non-Apple laptop. While you can run Windows under boot-camp it is not an ideal experience. For one the notebook runs very hot under windows. In OS X using the 9400m the notebook barely even gets warm, using the 9600m in OS X the notebook does get warm, but in Windows you can only use the 9600m and the notebook gets not warm, but very hot. You can feel the heat coming off the notebook as you type and it is a little uncomfortable. Metals have a low specific heat capacity (a term for us chemistry nerds) so since almost the entire notebook is made from aluminum you really feel the heat coming off.Also, the trackpad in Windows is trash. Often times I have to click 3-4 times for it to register the command, right clicking barely works. Enabling \"tap to click\" helps the clicking matter a lot but then you get the problem of accidently clicking by accident when you type. The trackpad is a big generous size but that means your palm will rub against it. In OS X the software is smart and knows when your typing so it ignores your palm rubbing against the trackpad and has not been a problem, not even one incident. In Windows I'll get accidental input several times in just a paragraph. While you type you'll all of a sudden delete a paragraph or a word somewhere because it accidentally registered a click and a highlight somewhere. Disabling \"tap to click\" is the only way to remedy this problem and connecting an external mouse is the only way to avoid punching your fist through your screen.Another problem is that you can't completely turn off the backlit keyboard under windows. A third problem is that the wireless card interferes with the sound card. Windows checks for new better wireless connections every 60 seconds and every time windows does this you get a sound crackle through your speakers (external or headphones) and a lag spike (terrible if you're playing online video games). Install a program called Vista Anti-Lag mostly solves this but not entirely. When I'm watching a movie I simply disable the wireless card to avoid sound crackling.All of these issues except the heat issue is a driver problem and something Apple can fix by writing proper software for its hardware in Windows. Apple actively advertises boot camp and the ability to run Windows on their computers so I feel it's only fair they properly support their hardware under Windows.  I follow forums quite a bit and I'm not the only user experiencing some of these problems. Apple so far has said it's not a big enough issue to bother solving. I wasn't aware of all of these issues under windows, but had I known of them I might not have ordered the Macbook Pro because as I stated before I simply don't have the option to not use Windows anymore. Face it, it's a Windows world we live in.Another thing I realized after buying a Macbook Pro is that you really are at the mercy of Apple when you join the Macintosh side. With Windows you have a large amount of notebooks to choose from. Don't like HP's notebooks? No problem you have at least a dozen manufacturers to choose from. Also, being in a Windows world means it'll be unlikely to come across software that is Macintosh only without a Windows alternative, not true the other way around. What brought all of this to my mind was when I first saw a Macbook next to a Macbook Pro. The screen on the Macbook is trash. It looks washed out and the colors are anything but vibrant. The Macbook Air on the other hand has a very nice screen, why Apple can't put that screen in the Macbook baffles me. Comparing the Macbook to windows laptops in a Best Buy stored shows that windows laptops costing half of what a Macbook costs had screens that were vast superior. What this means is that if you are in the Macintosh camp and you want a laptop with a nice screen you only have the choice of the expensive Macbook Pro. On the other hand if you are on a tighter budget the Windows world can offer you a nice screen at a low price. Switching from one operating system to another isn't easy either when you invest in software.On a bit of a side note, the first notebook  I received from Amazon came with a faulty superdrive but returning it was easy. I don't think this is a real big deal because all manufacturers will produce a few notebooks that are faulty, but I thought I should mention it.If you don't need to use Windows often and really want a luxury laptop then I think you'll really love the Macbook Pro. If you need to use windows often and can deal with a bit of slow performance under a virtualizing software like VMware then you should be happy as well. But if you need to use Windows often and need performance (even low intensity applications like Microsoft Word are a bit sluggish under VMware) then you should think long and hard about buying a Macbook Pro. Don't expect a windows experience as good as a dedicated windows system.Still I gave the Macbook Pro four stars. Overall I do find it to be an amazing experience under OS X but I hope software support increases or at least that Apple gets it's act together and offers better drivers for windows.

This is a superior platform with far fewer glitches, weird things, and security/virus/spyware issues.  Most Apple software you can use without buying a big book on Amazon on how to use them. [The money that some people save on buying a PC, often goes towards buying software similar to what comes BUILT-IN on a MAC, or to software for securing the machine (e.g. Trend Micro, Norton Antivirus), or speeding it up (e.g. Diskeeper disk defragmenter).  Furthermore, the security software on a PC often reduces performance by 10-20%.]I get about 2.5 hours battery life typically, and though that is about normal for notebooks (in general) with my kind of activity, (web, music, e-mail, movies, wireless) it really is not enough.  6 hours would be very good, and *8 would be perfect*.  I hardly use the DVD superdrive (about 10 times last year), and would MUCH PREFER IF APPLE USED A BUILT-IN BATTERY (like the MacBook Air or the new 17-inch MacBook Pro)  AND, THAT THEY REPLACE THE OPTICAL DRIVE WITH MORE BATTERY.  The MacBook Air has this, but is a no-go for me because of the smaller screen and resolution, and the 17\" is *for me* too big for lots of lugging around or use on a plane in Economy class.  As long as Apple bundles an external slim optical drive with the system, many people should be fine.*Aside*:  We should actually be getting physical content on Secure Digital (SD) Cards, and  SDHC (SD High Capacity).  Mechanical optical drives are so last century... including Blu-Ray.  Noise, scratched disks, skipping, misaligned heads... all those problems disappear.  It's a monumental shift like going from VHS to DVD.  Those little cards like what go in a camera can replace CDs, DVDs, AND Blu-Ray.  Imagine just slipping one of those into the side of a TV in order to watch a movie.  No need for separate Blu-Ray players and cabling, and this method uses far LESS ENERGY.  I really think this can be done... more and more people's content is purchased and downloaded or streamed anyway.  And an SDHC reader can be inserted into the ExpressCard slot of the MacBook Pro, further eliminating the need for an external optical drive.To reduce heat, noise,  and increase battery life and ruggedness, I am also eager for them to use Solid-State (no moving parts) Drives as standard on all MacBooks instead of mechanical hard drives.  However, you can get it now as an option.  If you have the money, get it (128 GB is available for the 15-inch; and 256 GB, or 128 GB are available for the 17-inch.)Make sure to cover your bases and get the Extended 3-year Apple Warranty.  You'll get peace of mind, and fast service from Apple.Finally, iLife and iWork shine with MobileMe [...].  Get MobileMe.  Yes you can backup to an external HD or Apple's Time Capsule, but it's in the house with your computer.  For true backups you need to have it offsite.  MobileMe and the iDisk will give you this (20GB).  Also, you can backup to 64GB flash drives such as those by Kingston.  [More reliable than hard disk, consumes less power=more battery life, and light enough that you can easily carry a backup (not your only backup) with you.]iWork.com allows you to share and collaborate with your documents similar to Google docs.  Note, currently iWork.com is not quite up to par. Also, it is a separate subscription to MobileMe, though it is free for trial/demo.In sum: an excellent machine with excellent Hardware, Software and Service and with exciting possibilities for the near future.", "Date": "February 7, 2009"}, {"Title": "17\" MacBook pro delivers on high expectations", "Author": "Robbert Patrison", "ReviewID": "R3ATWQEKBLZ06X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using my new 17\" unibody MacBook Pro intensively for over a week. It has hold up to the high expectations that I had from it. The design is stunning: the solid aluminum body is offset by a pitch-black screen. When closed, its a sleek minimalist work-of-art that looks smaller than its massive 17\" screen size. The top lid and bottom aluminum body fit perfectly, sealed like a fridge by a magnet and a slim rubber edge that runs around the entire display. Its gorgeous from any angle: the back is flush has no battery bay and there are no visible ventilation holes. The fan exhausts are intricately hidden in the hinging mechanism of the display. The fans are barely audible under normal use.Putting the unibody in on your lap after a cold night is a boner-shrinking experience. Also when powered up the MBP runs cool, consuming only 18 watts in normal use. Battery life is about 5 hours if you only do some office work. That is probably as good as it gets today. Battery life is considerably less when the graphics is stressed, or when I boot it in Windows Vista instead of OSX. I noticed that the battery life predictor never gets even close to the promised 8 hours. Apple marketing is quite simply lying.The display is stunning: the sharpest and best contrast I've seen until now. The colors and sharpness of the glossy screen is visibly better that that of the matte screen (a $50 option). In contrast to the glossy screen, the matte display is not mounted flush into the case. Side-by-side, the glossy looks a lot better. I noticed no problem with the reflections of the glossy screen in heavy daily use.Performance is good. Subjectively it seems faster and more responsive than my daughter's Imac. The system wakes up within a few seconds after opening the lid. My previous Dell tool a full 2 minutes to fully wake up after sleep, and much longer after a cold start. That is a real productivity saver.Of the 5 laptops in my home (of different vintage and make), the MBP seems to have the best and most solid WIFI connectivity. It picks up base stations that are out-of-reach of the other machines or Iphones.There are some minor design flaws: the front edge of the laptop is quite sharp. This is where your wrists rest, especially  when using the trackpad.  By now I've gotten used to this S&M; experience with cold metal, but its clearly a case of form-over-function.Another flaw is that the beautiful design of the lid forces the connectors to the side instead of the back of the laptop. When placed on a desk (which is 95% of the time),  a wild assortment of wires sticks out on the left, taking up precious real-estate on my desk. Since external displays require a adapter, the mess is even larger. Apple does not provide a docking station so my daily routine involves plugging in and out 5 wires multiple times. Apple uses a nonstandard video plug that require one to schlepp around two extra adapter cables anywhere. I would have gladly sacrificed the entire DVD-drive for this, since that is only used to install software.I've installed Windows Vista in 2 flavors: running in parallel using VMWare fusion, and sequential using bootcamp. Vista is a sluggish, slow and clumsy operating system compared to MacOS, so the latter is my preferred mode of operation. Fusion is faster and more convenient, but its only flaw is that it does not support graphics well (Flight simulator X did not work).In short, the 17\" MBP is probably the best (and certainly the most beautiful) laptop one can buy at this time. Its considerably more expensive than similarly equipped competitors, but it makes up for that by better components and better design.", "Date": "March 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Dripping with Awesome Sauce", "Author": "Brad Marx \"The Doctor\"", "ReviewID": "R1U8SF6C30YC4J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In the interest of full disclosure, I should say that my last laptop was an Acer Aspire 1640 (budget laptop) and that this is my first premium laptop. So, you can take my gushing with the appropriate amount of salt.That said, I really love the new Macbook Pro. It is a big plate of fantastic smothered in awesome sauce.-Multi Touch-While you won't be pinching and zooming all your apps or flicking windows around, multitouch scrolling, expose and right-click/CTRL-click all work really well. In fact, I held out from buying a Mac laptop because of the one button silliness. No buttons however, works like a dream. And the mutlitouch trackpad is pretty configurable to boot. I configured it to recognize a 2 finger tap as a right-click. It has spoiled me. I have a hard time using laptops w/o multitouch now.-Battery Life-They weren't kidding about the increased battery life. I get about 5 hours of design/coding/surfing time. I'm sure that watching videos and listening to music would impact that noticeably. But compare my 5 hour battery life to the 2 hour life of a friend's last gen Macbook Pro under the same usage. BTW, I have not changed the default performance settings or screen brightness for battery powered usage.-Display-The glossy screen may urk those used to a matte screen but I have always had glossy so it doesn't bug me. Aside from that, the screen looks great and seems on par with other glossy laptop screens--not noticeably better or worse really--and the color on it looks pretty good with no calibration. The black bevel adds a certain something to the experience and makes the screen feel bigger. There is a setting \"Automatically adjust brightness for ambient lighting\" which is on by default. While ingenious, for me, it fell into the too clever for their own good column as it made the display brightness change rapidly in any situation where the light was not consistent--such as a coffee shop where people frequently pass behind you blocking light. So I turned it off.-Mini Display Port-While it's great that the new display port allowed them to make the body slimmer or whatev, I have to say it stings a little knowing that I need a $30 dongle to hook it up to an external monitor while my buddy just plugs it in. It doesn't help the feeling knowing that previous generations of mac laptops (like the iBook) came with such dongles for free. Additionally, the DRM that is built into this port almost made this laptop a deal breaker. Not that I watch movies on external displays that are not compliant. I honestly don't even know if I own such a device. My problem is that DRM is such a ridiculous waste of resources and having it built into the hardware offends me to no end. To. No. End.-Other Thoughts-The performance is great even on battery power and even with a lot of apps open. The new body is very cool. It feels very sturdy, like all Macbooks, and looks really slick. I love the back-lit, black, chicklet keyboard that lights up based on the amount of ambient light. I also really dig that the new Macbook Pro is more environmentally friendly than the previous line and the packaging that it comes in is barely bigger than the laptop itself.This laptop is definitely the most awesome that I have ever used with only the aforementioned display issues holding me back from calling it absolutely perfect.

But it arrived all in one piece, and its working great...Speaking of the experience, right from the packaging (the white box as opposed to the conventional brown carton for a laptop), to the intro video of the mac OS X leopard, the Mag safe power cable with the magnetic latch, the ease of setting the OS up etc... it was all a breeze.. (my laptop arrived via courier at my office address, and i set up my system during lunch time.. less than 30 minutes flat)with regards to built quality, this thing is rock solid.. the aluminum unibody is robust, and you feel you're holding a block of metal.. no sqeaks, loose ends.... its pretty amusing to know how stalwarts like HP and Dell never thought of building a robust machine when it came to build quality.as for the performance, on paper the specs might not seem earth shattering, and there are a whole lot of other laptops that give a standard 3 GB ram and everything. But no one seems to be reading the fine lines. The frequencies of RAMs are higher, the caches are bigger, the chipsets are from nVidia (an intel chipset + nvidia graphic processor is a much slower option as compared to an nvidia chipset and nvidia graphic processor).in short, the hardware mix of the Macbook Pro (and the Macbook) is optimised to deliver performance with high amount of stability.. From the looks of it, all the hardware is tested to inter-operate seamlessly before the product is released into the market... before the mac I owned an HP, and the wireless device just used to konk off..! i have changed my motherboard thrice during my warranty period (HP service centres have been really helpful in this regard)as for software, OS X is certainly better, more intuitive, smooth and intelligent than Vista.. Vista is just plain paranoid, where it asks you every time you run a .exe file. Not to say that things dont hang in OS X.. things like Firefox do once in a while (rarely), but you can 'Force Quit' them and carry on with your other work.. unlike in Vista, where in all probablity you might have to restart the whole system..I use Adobe PS, InDesign, and Illustrator all together, along with iTunes running in the background, and Firefox downloading something or the other.. and all of them work like a charm.. and Expose+Spaces is like the icing on the cake.The whole 'all button' trackpad has met with a lot of criticism, but it really doesnt make a whole lot of difference.. i mean, if you're used to pressing buttons towards the bottom of the trackpad, do it by all means.. it will still work.. there's a right click too for those shifting from Windows..I run Win Xp SP2 on bootcamp.. and there's this only 1 MAJOR regret that have as far as MBP and MB goes.. I play a lot of games and they run beautifully on XP on mac using boot camp.. but for some weird reason the fans dont start spinning at higher speeds when running XP. and the GPUs clock temperatures upto 75-80 degrees C, which isnt really good..i use smc fan control for now, and tried using input remapper, but my Mac used to hang the moment i used Input remapper on XP.

I was the physician on the committee that selected the enterprise wise PACS system we use at three hospitals in North Carolina. At work I use several work stations and at home with wife and children we actively use five windows computers.Recently, I was looking for a laptop so as not to have to share our Dell 600m with the family.  I was considering a loaded windows laptop from Dell or HP but I was attracted to the Mac family because of all I had heard about Mac and the included software.  I polled a dozen friends and acquaintances  and all but one suggested I try the Mac.  Boy were they right.  In one evening I created a website for my band Ad Nauseam [...] using the included iWeb software.  I have also used garage band to take my live recordings and split them into separate songs then dropping them into itunes and burning CDs for my friends.  Yes, I could do all this on my windows machines, but it is so easy on the MacBook Pro.  You pay a premium for the tight integration.  I am less frustrated and more productive with my  MacBook Pro.  I have not yet installed software that will allow me to run windows programs in parallel with my Mac programs.  This will be important if I want to have one machine for work and play.  I understand that others have been successful doing this.Adding the MacBook Pro to my home network and wireless N+ (Belkin) router was a snap.  I can watch streaming video and download videos via Miro with ease.  Safari and Firefox are fine internet browsers.  Last weekend the children and I had an \"iChat\" with my sister and her family in CT for almost an hour.  The kids love seeing each other on the web cam and once again it was so easy to perform with the included, integrated software.I chose the 15\" version because I thought the 17\" might be to large on my lap.  With young kids around, I felt I might be more apt to have an accident with the larger one.  I did opt for the faster CPU though not sure how significant the difference between the two processors is in practice.Apple Care has been very helpful in answering my questions in a friendly and understandable way.

The new machines have a much more rigid, substantial feel, and appear to be much less susceptible to the torquing and bending that could afflict the older ones. And it's exactly as beautiful as the photos make it look.The performance is excellent, and jaw-dropping for somebody who came from a nearly 4-year-old Powerbook. I got this souped up 2.53 GHz configuration because of some of the work I do on the machine: developing very RAM-intensive imagery software, and audio recording and editing. If you're not doing something like that, and if you're not a hard-core gamer -- if you're using the machine for word processing and email and maybe iPhoto -- just get the 2.4 GHz. You won't notice the difference. Even if you do need the RAM or the hard drive, but you're not a gamer, you may not care about the improved graphics card. Consider ordering the 2.4 from Apple and upgrading the RAM and HD on that configuration. It will come out about $250 cheaper. I was going to do that, and bought the 2.53 instead only because it was on sale! (Still haven't received my rebate, although it hasn't quite been long enough that I'm concerned. But I have my eye on you, Amazon.)I was worried about the glossy screen, but find that I love it. Yes, it is *very* glossy -- but it's also vivid, extremely sharp, quite amazingly bright, and takes no time to reach its full brightness. The brightness easily overwhelms any more moderate reflections. I find that reflections rarely bother me. Surprisingly, it's usable in direct sunlight -- more so than previous Apple notebooks, in fact. The one situation where it's real trouble is when the sun is directly behind me or shining on me: then the reflection is bothersome. If your work setup is like that, be warned!The new keyboard feels great. It has a more solid, less squishy feel than the previous MacBook Pro. I find the touch pleasantly reminiscent of the original Titanium Powerbook, which always felt great to my fingers. My only complaint is that I can no longer press cmd and option simultaneously with one thumb; I am having to get used to new fingerings.The trackpad's increased area is fabulous, and the feel is great. The click, however, is distractingly loud. At first, having the whole thing be the button was a bit disconcerting, but I quickly got used to it and now like it better than the original. The two-finger right click is genius. Note that you can touch the trackpad with two fingers and then click with your thumb to get a right click! Much easier than their demo. The three-finger gestures are more or less useless; the four-finger expose gestures are more practical.The laptop is very slightly wider than the older model, which meant that I had to get a new case. I recommend Tom Bihn's \"Brain Cell,\" which protects against both dropping and bending, and fits inside your backpack (the vertical version) or briefcase (the horizontal).If you have any Firewire 400 devices, note that you do NOT need to buy an adapter! There are cables that go directly from FW 400 at one end to FW 800 at the other, and they eat up a lot less space.My only major complaint is really about the price of cables. The Mini DisplayPort is wonderfully small, and I see why they ditched DVI for it. The adapter cables, however, are ridiculously expensive! Furthermore, you can't just get a Displayport-to-DVI adapter and then plug your existing DVI-to-VGA into it. Doesn't work. Instead, you have to get a separate Displayport-to-VGA cable. Blah. Somebody needs to start making some generic adapter cables so that Apple can't get away with charging $30 for them!Despite my minor complaints, this is a magnificent machine -- and miles ahead of any other laptop in terms of both beauty and functional design.", "Date": "December 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazing machine", "Author": "Smart Little Magpie", "ReviewID": "R11A3T2ESFND8U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I should provide a disclaimer:  I'm a Windows convert, though I used Macs intermittently over the past 14 years; I wasn't paying attention to how cool they'd gotten until the new Macbooks came out and I realized that OS X existed.  Therefore, this review doesn't compare the new MBP with the more recent older Mac machines.  I'm mostly just comparing my new MBP to the long string of Windows machines I've owned, the most recent one being a beefy version of the Dell Latitude D610 laptop.That said, it's been a month since I received my new MBP from Amazon, and I absolutely love it.Keyboard:  very comfortable and quiet; limited space to get crumbs stuck beneath the keys.  Very good size.Trackpad:  Generous space and smooth operation for the most part; the only shadow in my glowing review is that as others have mentioned, the trackpad can be really buggy sometimes.  It was definitely worse right out of the box, so don't let that scare you if it happens - it gets better with use.  A month later, I almost prefer using the trackpad to a regular mouse because of its multitouch functions that make scrolling and navigating such a breeze, and I love the smooth feel of the pad itself, but it won't always register a double click on an item if I, say, want to pick up a file and drag it somewhere.  Sometimes even physically clicking the pad won't register appropriately.  I have the bottom right corner designated as \"right-click,\" but sometimes areas other than that one will register as right-clicks, too.  This doesn't happen all the time, but it's still kind of irritating that it happens at all.  Even given that, though, I love this trackpad and wouldn't trade it for any PC trackpad.Chassis:  so, so solid, yet so lightweight, thin and beautiful.  You can feel this for yourself if you go play with one at an Apple store.  I'll be heeding others' comments here about how thin the metal is around some of the ports, though.Screen:  lots of people hate it.  I don't!  I work with my computer in a variety of different light settings around my home and I took it to my office once, but I have not used it outside yet (but come springtime, you can bet I will).  Yes, sometimes there is glare, but guess what?  I can tilt the screen or shift the computer a little to one side to avoid most of it.  I think the quality and beauty of the screen is more than worth these tiny adjustments I have to make to compensate for its reflectiveness.  Some people definitely prefer matte screens, but if you like the look of the glossy screen or want the color quality that comes with it, don't fear the glare, unless you're super picky about the kinds of adjustments I described.  (One note, though it's already been said:  the regular MB does not have as nice a screen; comparing the two myself in an Apple store, I could definitely see a difference in color quality and viewing angles.)OS:  I really love the new Mac OS.  It's so seamless, so intuitive, and I love how all the programs work together.  It's not as if I need an OS this user-friendly, either; I was technically savvy enough to understand Windows pretty well, and I use Linux at work.  But it's just so nice to come home to an OS that knows what it's doing and does things for me.  Also, with Mac much more popular nowadays, my fears of finding software options closed to me have proven unfounded.  Granted, I'm not looking for any particularly necessary, high-end software for major projects; just little things like clients for various tasks, free art software (like the Gimp), and things like that.  I also found a program that lets me change the system fonts, since to be honest, the giant Lucida Grande was starting to grate on me just a little after a lifetime of being in total control of my GUI.Performance:  I have not had a single crash yet.  I think something slowed things down once, and I restarted.  Once.  In a month.  And it was probably my fault.  The system is very fast; during my file transfers from the old computer to the new one, it takes my Dell (2.13 GHz) multiple minutes to copy files it takes my Mac (2.4 GHz) \"about a minute\" to copy.  Airport wireless worked easily the minute I took my computer out of the box, is really reliable and maintains a really strong connection.  My MBP runs super-quietly, it refuses to heat up (during our frigid Northern winters, this could actually be seen as a con!), DVDs run reasonably quietly, and, well, basically, everything just works, quietly, quickly, and easily.I can't recommend getting a Mac enough, especially a MBP if you have the extra cash.

I have read that viewing angles were limited but I don't find that to be the case for me (with regular positioning and use).For the size of a widescreen 15.4\" notebook, this design is thin and lightweight (5.5 lbs) which matches the weight of many notebooks at the 14.1\" size of Windows based notebooks.I use this notebook on a table or my lap.  It does not get hot like prior generations of Macbook Pros which got very uncomfortably hot.The plug attaches by a magnetic type interface which is easy to use and more durable than other notebook interfaces that tend to dislodge from regular use (My old Gateway and an older model Compaq).There are 2 USB ports, a Firewire 800 port, earphone and microphone jacks, and a monitor port.  A slot for the optical drive is convenient and is software/hardware driven.  It is relatively quiet for its operation.  I do not even hear the cooling fan when it runs.Integrated webcam with very good field of view and resolution for its size.  Using the camera it is easy to do videoconferencing or video chatting (iChat).  The video chat also works with Google's Chat interface.BatteriesThe battery is unlike the batteries of its predecessors.  I ordered the older battery and obviously, it would not fit.Battery life is decent with WIFI and Bluetooth inactivated and brightness set to lower levels, allowing me about 3 hours and 45 minutes.  I love how you can display batter life as a percentage or absolute time.Wifi and Bluetooth activation are easy to operate (at the upper right hand corner of the screen).  I can log in quickly from anywhere.  I just click on the Wireless icon at the top right hand corner to see what networks are available and I am online.  It was not so simple with Windows.ProgramsArmed with the Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard (includes Time Machine, Quick Look, Spaces, Spotlight, Dashboard, Mail, iChat, Safari, Address Book, QuickTime, iCal, DVD Player, Photo Booth, Front Row, Xcode Developer Tools) and iLife '08 (includes iTunes, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iWeb, GarageBand), you can do a lot with the notebook right out of the box.  I did purchase extra software for more versatility:Microsoft Office 2008 for Mac Special Media EditionFinal Cut Express 4Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 (Mac)I had Windows XP before and syncing the IPOD with that system was well, buggy.  With the Macbook Pro, as soon as I turned on the notebook, the updates ran seamlessly and did not affect the performance of the machine.  I also decided to sync my notebook with the Macbook Pro which was very easy and I had not one error.  I also found it faster to sync with my IPOD when compared to my Windows based predecessor.  Overall, it was a more positive experience for me.The Dashboard has useful applets with more to download from the Apple web site.  Things like movie theater times, snowfall repots, conversions, weather, a dictionary, thesaurus, and calendar (just to name a few) that don't require the browser but may need internet access.  The Widgets are very useful.My favorite is the 'movie theater times' since I just activate Dashboard, I can check the theater and movie and I am done in less than a minute (it is like a virtual newspaper).Spaces is a great feature for me.  It allows me to switch to different windows to see what program is running without clutter.  It is like having a four foot screen with all of the windows.PROSLightweight for the size of the screenThin profileNext generation trackpad (works similar to an iPhone/IPOD TouchEase of operation and installation of programsGood base of programs installedVirtually no BLOATWARESimplicity of designCan run windowsDual video card configurationSpacesCONSCostAverage battery lifeNo matte screen optionI also added the Applecare Protection Plan (3 year duration) which I was advised will be worth the price for technical support and repairs (if necessary).  I highly recommend getting the Protection Plan:AppleCare Protection Plan MA515LL/A for MacBook Pro (w/ or w/o display)One peripheral that I thought was very useful was the Apple Remote which I found new on the Amazon Marketplace for $5:Apple Remote Control for iPod (White)ConclusionOverall, this is a solid notebook with the capabilities to run Windows (but why?).  The design is simple and easy to use.It has made an Apple convert out of me, out of all of these years (23 years - am I that old?) of PC computing from the IBM AT/XT days (monochrome screens, 5 inch floppy drives, 2400 baud modems, noisy dot matrix printers and clicky keyboards).I highly recommend this product.  It made an Apple Mac OS X convert out of me!", "Date": "December 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "Still a pretty decent computer for some, but a MAJOR downgrade from previous generation.

No longer useful for Art, Photography, Video professionals.  I have owned every upgrade to the Powerbook/Macbook Pro line for 9 years.  EVERY single one!  This is the first I had to return :(First the good-Very solid chassis, even more so than before.-some of the benefits the previous generation had-easier access to the hard drive for upgrade-Improved Vid card-Laptop that runs OSX, still the best operating system in use today!The Bad (compared to the previous generation)-Thinner by a hair, but wider and deeper yet a SMALLER battery?  Very poor choice by Apple.  End result = worse battery life in a larger laptop with the same size screen. (downgrade)-Keyboard, some do like the new keyboard, I do not.  It is simply not as good as the one it replaces. (Downgrade)-Screen screen screen, the glossy screens are absolute garbage if you want proper color rendition or if you want to use it anywhere that you do not have complete control of where the lights are.  Coffee shop?  Good luck.  Library?  I don't think so!  I am a professional photographer and I had to return the new Macbook Pro mainly because the glossy screen (no option for Matte anymore) has horrible color reproduction. (downgrade)-New Trackpad.  Apple has lost their way with the Macbook Pro.  The Pro part used to mean \"for professionals\"  this is definitely not the case anymore.  No button on the trackpad \"neato\" until you try to edit  a photo.  Try applying a brush while holding the whole trackpad down!  Same can be said of many programs. Basically this gimmick has many serious repercussions on real world use. (Downgrade)-Removed the Firewire 400 port.  Huh?  Still WIDELY used by Pro's.  A single Firewire 800 port just won't cut it. (Downgrade)-Very sad to see such a great tool fall into consumer trends.  Apple will slowly begin to lose it's ability to charge a premium for this product.  Much of the premium was based on the idea that professionals use it.  I genuinely think this will be a thing of the past in a VERY short time if Apple does not do something to fix this product.Sorry Apple, but you missed the mark BIG time on this one.The previous generation is still available as I write this and at GREAT prices.  I would grab the absolute best of that generation, as it may be the last great model.", "Date": "November 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "So much to say...", "Author": "Scott D. Espenschied \"ScoDal\"", "ReviewID": "R2VGRT0I45JFMA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "All my life I have been a Windows & Linux user... using PC's to do everything I need to do. I needed to get an Apple computer so I could develop Apple Apps for iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touch. So, I did lots of research to find the best bang for the buck thinking the only thing I need this device for is to just to make these apps at work. I can't lie though, I knew that Xcode wouldn't be the only thing this laptop was capable of doing. So, when it arrived, I booted it up and immediately tried to familiarize myself with how it operated. I have had almost NO Apple experience in the last 10 years. From my research I learned that there were certain things that were a requirement for my Apple purchase. I MUST have a 64-bit processor to stay up with the times and with Apple phasing things out. I MUST have either Snow Leopard or Mountain Lion. This laptop came with Snow Leopard. From the reviews I read, Snow Leopard is probably the preferred OS for this machine so I think I am going to keep it on here since it's working great.So now that you know my background and primary usage a little bit I will explain to you my thoughts as a technology enthusiast.Cosmetically, I think this laptop is really beautiful. It feels well built, I really like the glowing keys, and the glossy screen has a beautiful display. I am a matte screen lover but hey what can ya do. I have a lot of matte screen laptops, can't hurt to have a glossy one too. The glossy screen certainly isn't and shouldn't be a deal breaker for using or wanting this laptop.The first hour using the laptop I was glued to Safari searching how to do this and how to do that. I was impressed with how responsive this laptop was with every command I threw at it. I think my first session on this laptop lasted around 4 hours, and in that short 4 hours I learned how to download software, mount and install software, eject the .dmg image file, clean up my storage, understand where files are installed and how they are accessed, manage my Applications, run virtual operating systems with Vmware Fusion, how to emulate windows applications with Wine, and multitask using the many different finger swipe methods available. I like very much that Snow Leopard is an Apple/Unix combo.. what I mean is I love having access to Terminal! I was scared of how quickly I was becoming addicted to the laptop. Two things I'm still not used to about Apple/Snow Leopard but realize I just have to deal with are: No print screen button & moving files is a little weird (unless you memorize the keyboard shortcut). Again, not deal breakers, but as a web designer nothing to me is more useful than the Print Screen button.All in all, this laptop runs extremely smooth, is very fun to use, looks cool when I use it, and is a powerhouse of so many options. Surf the web, create Apple apps, do video editing, do photo editing, create art, chat with friends, do it all! Do it all at the same time! This laptop won't care it'll just keep multitasking. The only time I could feel it slow down a little is when I had 3 virtual operating systems running at the same time (Windows 7, Mountain Lion, and Windows XP) but even then it kept going, it just wasn't reallllly happy that I wanted to do all that at one time hahaDo I recommend this laptop? Yes. It's definitely a pleasurable laptop to use. You will definitely get many great hours of enjoyment out of it. Personally, I still feel more comfortable doing my actual web work and code on a Windows machine, but it's a wonderful thing to have both options at my finger tips. The macbook pro is a GREAT communication device (social media, chat, etc) and internet surfer, now THAT is for sure.

Much faster than what I had before, and video plays remarkably better.  If you're reading this, you're probably conversant with some of the specs and \"issues\" of the MBP, so let me give you my experience:The screen is reflective, yes, but it's also so bright that once you turn it on you  won't see your reflection. Then again, I don't have a window behind me. The positive thing about the screen is the richness of colors... Apple has talked about \"lickability\" for years, and that's what I see with this screen.The case is rock solid. No quality problems that I have seen. I did open it to upgrade the RAM, and it was a pain finding a small-enough screwdriver for the 8 screws that I had to remove. That is my only complaint. I like having a lighter laptop, and this one feels much lighter to me than the 17\" PowerBook.The first time I saw this baby I fell in love with it, but I assumed for the price that I'd end up getting the MacBook. But, I finally succumbed to the higher-quality display of the MBP. I also like the black band around the screen. It makes the screen look larger and classier, and it's easier on the eyes.The trackpad was easy to get used to. It's a work of art in itself.

This is my first mac and I have had very little experience with mac before this purchase. I have had this computer for a few weeks now so I feel like I can provide an accurate review.Design: Absolutely beautiful! It seems like they really thought everything out. The magnetic latch and magnetic power cord are genius and very nice features. The computer does seem very sturdy and well built.Screen: I know many complaints are about the screen and it is indeed reflective. HOWEVER, I have yet to have a problem with reflection and the screen is vibrant, I love it.Hinge: I have read complaints on the hinge being too weak. I have not experienced this with mine and would say the resistance is about perfect. I can tip the computer at a very steep angle without the screen falling.Trackpad: This was one feature I was a little concerned about. I did experience a few problems with the trackpad but the update from apple fixed that. I can honestly say this is probably one of the greatest features of the machine. It took about 5 minutes to get used to the gestures and not having a dedicated button. Now, I feel like all other machines should have this trackpad and I really miss it when I am using other machines.Keyboard: This is a personal preference but I love the \"Chicklet\" style keys and it feels great. The backlight is nice to have also.Performance: This machine is fast! I have the Adobe CS4 Design premium loaded on the machine and it handles it with no problem. All other programs open and run amazingly fast. I have yet to have any problems with performance. Also, the machine is very quiet and stays cool. Battery life seems to be fine but I have not really put it to the test.Compatibility: I have yet to experience any compatibility issues. I do have Windows XP running through VMware Fusion 2.0 and it works pretty good (Separate review for this product). All my electronics and printers just worked...sure is nice.Value: So far I am very happy with my purchase. The machine runs great, looks great, and I am happy that I made the switch.

I know that I was just tired of all the mess there is in keeping a PC up to date and always running. Drivers, inter-application support, all of this is just something PC owners deal with and have gotten use to. I'm tired of it.I found the iLife suite of applications a perfect answer for everything I needed. iPhoto, iMovie and of course iTunes (which I was already using on the PC along with my iPhone) are just a joy to use. iPhotos \"places, faces and events\" are super cool. And it's amazing how easy it is to get photos in and tagged. Everything about OSX just flows easily and never gets in my way. Everything works together smoothly and nothing competes with each other. i.e. WIndows Photo Viewer and Media Player both wanting to manange your pictures and videos DIFFERENTLY. Typical PC reply is \"oh just download this other app and install this service and then run this codec pack and set this registry entry and you're all set'\"  NO...I'M DONE WITH THAT. iLife and OSX WORK.Now to the hardware.I liked the previous generation MacBook Pro. It was missing some things though for the price. For one, it seemed to not really offer much in build and features I couldn't get elsewhere much cheaper in a PC laptop. This was not to say I would buy a PC but it meant I was looking at the MacMini or possibly even the iMac. Something I didn't really want to do. I wanted a laptop. So I waited. Another year with the PC...then finally these new ones hit.I was blown away by the features videos and when I got to handle one in person...WOW. They are thinner yet completely SOLID. Picking one up or just smashing the keys and you feel like you're using something God would use. I can rest my fat palms on the faceplate without worry. The new black backlit keys are MUCH easier to see and feel great! The buttonless touch pad (the entire thing is a button) is amazing. It's like the iPhone except with the addition of a button. Which is perfect. Be nice if the iPhone could get this feature some how. The gesture support is spot on. It's the first time I've ever used a touchpad and NOT wanted to get a mouse instantly. You can really use it all day and it's transparent. It operates so smoothly. FINALLY.The sound from the speakers is much improved. iTunes in the background or jamming out loud is very clear and full sounding for a laptop speaker. Nothing sounds harsh or crushed. They are laptop speakers mind you, but for that, they are the best I've heard.The display is very clear and off angle is nice. I find the contrast to be pretty good and the 3D performance to be awesome. (and should be with a 9600). The auto switching to the slower power saving 9400 is a pretty neat trick too. I play World of Warcraft and EVE-Online and they both run quite smoothly. When running on battery there is a performance hit with the cycled down cpu and slower 9400, but you'd expect that. I also tried Team Fortress 2 via \"Crossover for Games\" and it ran very smoothly. With only a couple of small display glitches.My only real complaint is the lack of USB ports, it has two. I really wish it had TWO more. My model has the express slot instead of the mini card slot. I find you have many more expansion options with the express slot. Including putting in your own mini card reader. So why limit your options?Finally, Amazon's price was $200 cheaper than Apple's.

At home I have a Logitech wireless external keyboard and mouse, a Western Digital Firewire 800 external drive, and a 22\" HP Flat Widescreen Monitor, so it is almost like having a desktop only cooler. I am a dual OS user (Windows/Mac) and I also have both OS on my Mac. Mac OS is by far the superior operating system. But, this computer runs Windows XP and Windows 7 (beta) fast. That's the good thing about a Mac, you can natively run Windows without emulation software, so there is nothing sucking up the processor power! Of course you can use VM Ware or Parallels if you want to run WIndows while running Mac OS which is also cool, but just not as fast. So, for all the people who cry about how expensive the Mac is, IT IS TWO COMPUTERS IN ONE, a Windows machine, a Mac, and  if you want to run Linux that too. Everything runs flawlessly in windows as long as it is either USB or firewire. I also upgraded my wireless router to an \"N\" device, and let me tell you, the router is in my basement and I am two flights up. I get a faster connection than with my ethernet cable plugged in (running 100 Mbps). My next upgrade will be an Time Capsule, though part of my external drive is partitioned for Time Machine, which works quietly on its own in the background.When I go out with my MacBook Pro I never had any problem connecting to Public WiFi networks. The computer simply finds what's available and asks you if you want to connect, it's easier than Windows wireless connections. I also must admit, that when going places, this is the machine you want to be seen with, it is just attractive. So far I haven't seen anyone else with this machine at the places I bring it, I see mostly older MacBook Pros, but the \"Black\" keys give away that you have the newer model, not to mention the slim aluminum case. The keys are lit from behind for dark locations, shut off in bright locations to save battery, and dim accordingly as the light changes. There is also manual control, but the automatic works fine. Same with the screen brightness. It adjusts automatically according to the lighting of the environment you are currently in. There is also manual adjustment, but I never touch it. It also dims during periods of inactivity to save battery power. The screen itself is just awesome, the best laptop screen out there. I am a fan of glossy screens, to me it just makes the picture more vibrant, so those who like the matte screen might be disappointed, since this model does not that.The NVidia Graphics in this machine is top notch too, I use this laptop for video, and with the high graphics turned on, this laptop does a great job. A quick note though, if you are on battery power you will definitely want to just use the integrated graphics mode, since this will almost double the runtime. You will also want to turn off the bluetooth radio, since this also eats up a lot of juice. It's best to bring the power adapter if you plan on doing video or picture editing or heavy bluetoothing.When I go out, I use the trackpad, and leave the mouse at home. You get use to the pad quickly, including the gestures and lack of any buttons, it is quite intuitive. You just have to remember that the button is towards the bottom.The only thing that is a \"con\" for me is that the DVD writer is only 8X and not 16X, but that is just a minor inconvenience.", "Date": "June 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Product - Great Service", "Author": "Gary G.

The MacBook Pro is all brighter, sharper, and more beautiful. The screen opens with just a slight touch and the picture is all there in all colors. The screen is like an endless pool - no sharp edges, filled with light and color.The display was very important to me and that is why I chose this over the other models. Side by side, the pictures are like night and day. There is no comparison.One of the most interesting changes is how intuitive and insightful the new trackpad is. This trackpad allows a variety of new moves, including using two fingers or more at a time - even for scrolling.Light up keyboard. Never even knew I needed it though it probably won't be convenient outside.This computer is bigger and faster, as fast as a computer could be. I always wonder why a computer would need to go any faster but the next one always does. Do we get faster? Or does the endless quest for more speed just make us think we do?Concerns:There is a fragility to this that I don't remember ever noticing with my PowerBook. My PowerBook has traveled in backpacks and briefcases and may even have been thrown in a purse from time to time. (Much worse has happened to it.) I even fell off an icy ledge once, with it in my backpack, and it survived. Cats have slept on the PowerBook, open and closed. Drinks have been spilled. The Powerbook is like a workhorse whereas the MacBook Pro seems a little too delicate to throw in a backpack.This is my third Macintosh and the best so far. I was reluctant to leave behind my PowerBookG4 as it moves onto the boat for a second life as a navigator.

I recently installed Windows XP Professional under Bootcamp and it went really smoothly; I still need Windows for some proprietary software I use, and for some mild gaming.  For instance, I picked up Oblivion - GOTY Edition for $20 and thought I'd give it a good run on the Macbook Pro.I haven't had a chance to run any heavy-hitter games yet, but Oblivion runs beautifully at the full 1440x900 w/ 4x AA and Very High Quality settings.  I'm averaging anywhere from 25fps-60fps, depending on the number of sprites; forests (35-40fps), oblivion (40-42fps), town squares (50fps), water and swimming (30-40fps).  The lowest I've seen is 25fps but haven't been able to replicate it; I'm thinking it was Windows running a background process I missed or forget to turn off.  In any case, it runs beautifully.I've really come to appreciate the extra screen real estate, and the display quality of the MBP.  We own a mid-2008 20\" iMac 2.66Ghz and the screen is every bit as good of quality; I really feel like the Macbook Pro is like a \"portable iMac\" in terms of speed and display quality.  It's that good!Lastly, I had a chance to pick up Apple's DisplayPort -> VGA adapter since I will need to hook this notebook up to a LCD projector more than a few times next semester.  The dongle is not cheap but does what it says it will without any fuss.  To test it, I hooked it up to my 42\" 1080i HDTV and it looked beautiful, no interference or pixelation.Two weeks later, this little guy is still working every bit as good as the day I bought it.  :-)--For the past few weeks, I've been shopping for a new notebook computer.  I've owned/used Mac in the past, but am comfortable in both worlds; I prefer Mac, but can get along fine in Windows too.I inevitably ended up with the 15\" Macbook Pro 2.66Ghz because of the sheer size, weight, and performance.  After I spent some time actually touching/using all the competing brands, I came to the following conclusion--you truly do get what you pay for.Some would argue that Macs are too expensive and not worth the hefty cost over their Windows/PC counterparts. Moreover, they would also say that you're paying extra for the fancy-shmancy design and chimp-simple ease of use, not to mention feeding into the smugness of the Mac community.However, my wife and I have owned Macs for the last few years, and I've had a really good experience owning Apple computers.One thing I noticed immediately is the build quality; it's amazing, and very well made.  When you pick up the computer, it feels very rigid and sturdy; it really does feel like a solid piece of equipment compared to other notebooks.The fans are very quiet and the unit seems to regulate heat/temperature very well.  When I turn it on, the Macbook 'bonggggg' sound is the only thing I hear, and cannot hear the hard drive at all.  It's probably the quietest computer I've ever owned.I've not owned this unit long enough (less than 36hrs) to give a more detailed example, but I'm very delighted with the performance in iMovie and iPhoto '09.  It's VERY fast.All in all, whether you choose the 2.4Ghz or 2.6Ghz, it's a great investment in a notebook computer.
