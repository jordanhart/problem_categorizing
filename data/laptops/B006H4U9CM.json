{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid, elegant laptop and terrific value!", "Author": "Jeremy C. Fretts \"Jeremy Fretts\"", "ReviewID": "R25LHHPWFSZ66B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I spent three months researching laptops, visiting local stores to touch and feel, and then decided to order this laptop - sight unseen.  Its combination of features was enough to overwhelm my intimidation for buying a product I hadn't gotten to touch.  I have not been disappointed.While pictures may make this seem like a bland black laptop, it is quite handsome in person, and very solidly made.  The keyboard is solid, the hinge is sturdy, it's incredibly thin and light.  Touchpads are often terrible, but this one is very good. My only complaint about the touchpad is that it's a single button, so you need to click at the far ends for best response.  Still, its 'clickability' is better than every one of the many laptops I tested and endless stores.The battery design is unique in that it projects out the back a little, forming a 'foot' to stand the laptop on (allowing easy airflow).  A benefit of this design is that it also forms a nice place to grip the laptop -- it's a handle!The laptop runs cools and seems to perform well.  The other concern I had was the low megapixel rating on the webcam, but it's fine for Skype, and works extremely well in low light.I've been thrilled with this purchase, and really do feel that I got an incredible value for the money I paid.", "Date": "March 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great laptop.", "Author": "R.

I swapped the stock hard drive for a Sandisk 120GB SSD and it's been great.

J&R; delivered FAST.  I chose the free delivery and it still came in about 4 business days after ordering (which was great because my old computer had a hard drive malfunction while I was in the middle of my semester).  The product came in excellent shape, as described, and it's a great machine.  Can't be beat for the price.  Light, fast (I don't do any gaming but I suspect it could handle it), plenty of ports, pretty good screen, responsive keyboard, stiff chassis.  And overall, this thing just looks pretty darned good.  Simply very appealing to look at.The only cons I can think of:I noticed that the touchpad isn't as responsive as my last laptop (Dell XPS M1330).  But now that I think about it, I haven't noticed it recently.  I think it just takes some getting used to transitioning from another brand.The speakers were not as good as I expected.  When I saw \"Altec Lansing speakers\" on the description, I think I got my hopes up.  The speakers that come with this laptop are average in all respects.  But I guess I can't ask for too much on a 4 pound machine.  Also let's be honest, if you're serious about your music, you're not going to be listening to it out of your laptop anyway.  Audio out sounds good plugged into headphones or external 2.1s.That's all folks.  Would highly recommend this machine and this retailer.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you like a 14in laptop buy this you will love it!", "Author": "Travis Dean", "ReviewID": "REY3RA6PXAB9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my first ASUS laptop. I could not be happier. It is very slim and light. It has the perfect look and style. Quality is much better than most other laptop company's. The only thing I have noticed that I wish was better is the speakers. They are not as good as the average laptop speakers. If you buy this laptop and you like smaller laptops, you will absolutely love it.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B006H4U9CM"}}
