{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good laptop", "Author": "Hobbyist", "ReviewID": "RWASEJ4UGDVUX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded to this from a 4 year old Lenovo B450.  First off I bought this on Prime and paid $10 extra for saturday one day shipping and it didn't arrive until 3 business days later.  I called Amazon customer service and they refunded my shipping and extended my Prime membership for one month.As far as the product goes....this is my first day with it so I am still getting used to it.Screen:  This is my first computer with a touchscreen and I like it so far.  This screen is very responsive.  As others have stated with the Flex line from Lenovo, the screen dims uncontrollably. I just searched the web on fixes and downloaded a new display and graphic driver and as soon as it installed, the screen lit up like a christmas tree!  If anyone needs help with this, leave a comment.System:  Comes with Windows 8.1 64 bit installed which was nice because I thought I would have to do the update myself.  This particular model uses a Intel Core i5 and has a 1TB HDD and 16GB SSD.  This computer is so much more responsive and speedy than my old Lenovo ever was.Sound:  The speakers are very impressive and even at half volume, vibrate my hands while I am typing!Keyboard:  The keyboard is.....different.  The keys don't travel very far so it is going to take a lot of getting used to but it still feels like a quality keyboard. One gripe I have is the location of the \"0\" key on the numberpad.  It is different than my old Lenovo, but then again, my old one had the CTRL and FN key swapped???? So I can't complain too much.Touchpad:  This touchpad works better than my old one.  it is more responsive and I don't constantly hit it while I am typing.  The palm rest surface is \"metal\" and feels very strange but in a good way.Overall, I would recommend this laptop.  It is fast, light, and holds a good amount of charge.  Some things I wish were different:-  My wife's $280 Asus T100 came with a full version Office 2013 and this only comes with a trial for one month.  For the price, I wish it was included.-  The brightness was a turn-off at first but is fixable-  I wish the AC adapter cord was a bit longer-  Numberpad layout - 0 Button under the 2 key-  Num Lock button, while it does light up to let you know it is on, it constantly turns off (like when I close the lid and other things)-  Keyboard not backlitUPDATE: 3/2/14I was wrong about the fix for the uncontrollable dimming.  You do not need a different driver.

Our first touch screen and it works great. I usually buy HP but wanted to give this brand a try and I am not disappointed. It looks big and heavy but it is very light and thin.

It does not really fold over into a pad.  It sort of folds over, but the screen has to be at about a 60-70 degree angle in the up position.  I wanted a full fold over so I could lay it in my lap or use it easily on an airplane.  All the other pad/computers I saw folded over and I thought this one would do the same!!  Lesson learned!2. Windows 8 is not my idea of a good operating system.  I tried to install one of the programs that would make it look like 7 but that just screwed up the computer and made it completely unusable.  I called Lenovo for help and they told me they could send a tech for $169 since it was a software problem, not a hardware problem.  So much for support!  I got lucky because a friend of mine knew how to back off the update. It took about 5 minutes wand he walked me thru it on the phone.  I think I owe him BIG time.  Lenovo could have done the same in the time it took them to keep saying $169!!  At least they showed me how to get into safe mode and that was NOT documented or obvious or what you would normally do!3. I had to order a special cable to connect my 24\" monitor because it did not have a port for the monitor.4. I like the 15\" screen, but since I cannot fold it over it is not really that great.  When I use it as a PC i am usually plugged into my 24\" monitor so it is not that great!5. I wish I could say something good about it, but any other PC is as good or better for the price and most of the other Pad/PCs are better since they work like a Pad should!", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HIY9I6S"}}
