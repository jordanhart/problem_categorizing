My objective was to buy an inexpensive machine running Windows 7 that would do a better job of running some of my more demanding tasks that were a burden on my older Vista machine. The Dell machine I received from Tampa Laptops did exactly that. It was fast, quiet and powerful. However, it did have one problem. It would crash about two times out of three on a shutdown or a reboot. Support at Tampa Laptops worked with me by phone and email for about a week to try to resolve the problem. Finally they decided to have me return it at their expense. They emailed a shipping label, so the process could not have been easier. They found a problem with the power board, so they sent me a second machine with my original disk with all its settings intact. The second machine is fine. It is clean, runs well, and the battery has lots of power. I highly recommend Tampa Laptops.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00B0EUST8"}}
