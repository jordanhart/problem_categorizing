{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good bang for buck", "Author": "Christian De Freitas", "ReviewID": "R18LHI0SVC878H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently received this laptop for review, on 123techreview.blogspot.com and after I used it for a while, I have to say, this is as fast as a Core i7 4500u laptop.The first thing that got my attention was the fact that it was a 4th generation, Core i5 M series processor, as you may know, the M series is the \"performance\", and the U series is the \"low-voltage-earth-friendly\" series. That being said, the Core i5 4200M is faster than the Core i5 4200U.The other fact that surprised me, was the Graphics, the Intel HD 4600. It is 30% faster than the HD 4000. The resolution is average at 1366 x 768 with glossy display and OK viewing anglesIt comes with:The standard 802.11 b/g/nBluetooth 4.0VGAHDMI2x USB 3.01x USB 2.0This computer booted up quickly into Windows 8.1, but I felt it was missing something I'm used to, my SSD Drive, I upgraded this for testing, the Samsung 840 Pro http://amzn.to/1nobaZP (left the 1TB HDD in a usb 3.0 case) and upgraded the RAM to 16GB (the max supported) and I have to say, I just might buy this laptop for myself, it runs incredibly fast, boots in under 10 seconds, and loads Photoshop in a snap.The HDD connector is SATA 3, and the memory it uses DDR3 PC3-12800 204pinThe HDMI output supports 1080p, had no problem watching my 1080p videos from the GoPro Hero 3+ BE on my 32\" LG TV without any lag.I would have liked a resolution of 1440x900 since thats the new standard, but at this price, I can overlook that fact, since similar laptops cost at least 150 dollars more, and some doesn't come with bluetooth.It has only one 3.5mm jack for headphone/microphone combo, so if you have speakers and mic separate you will not be able to use them together unless you use an adapter like this one http://amzn.to/1iq42aPIt comes with Windows 8.1 which  is very welcome since 8.0 was a disaster, it has a recovery partition just in case something goes wrong. Battery lasted 5 hours with light browsing over wifi, almost 4 hours streaming youtube video. Once I installed the SSD I got almost an hour more under each condition.I you think this laptop is too thick, there's the G510s 59406582 http://amzn.to/1j192CF has the same specs, lower profile and touchscreen.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "Tonya B Green", "ReviewID": "R2XP35I9HW9NLS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this computer.

Lapointe \"RAL\"", "ReviewID": "R3NK5LO8N9C5PE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I  purchased this computer after a lot of research.  I do like it (even the Windows 8.1).  However, after a month of use, the keyboard has broken down.  An external one works.  The on-screen one works.  However, not the one that counts.  Technical help at Lenovo was very good but could not solve the problem.  Therefore, I have to send it to their 'Authorized Service Center\" at my cost ($97) in order to get in fixed (after a month's use!!!)  This is my only complaint so far if, and only if, I do not have to pay again---especially since it is still under warranty.  By the way, I would have given it 2.5 stars if I could have--- because of the frustration since I lost all my information when I had to try setting the computer back to factory defaults (without solving the problem).  A lot of frustrating hours lost and more to come when it is returned.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good but not great", "Author": "Jerome Martino", "ReviewID": "RHCDMYC9AW2E6", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Functionally works fine, however fit and finish are middle of the road or less.

It took me a long time to choose one because I wanted something with good specs, that could play games when I wanted to as well. I wanted to go for an i8, but with the price I started looking at some laptops with an i5. I finally decided on this one and I am glad I finally bought it. The keys are a good distance apart and easy to press. The fn keys are reversed, making it easier to mess with the volume and brightness levels. Laptop starts well and has ran smoothly since I got it. I played the Elder Scrolls Online Beta on good settings (not the top, but next down). Runs Minecraft perfectly and my husband has used it for Diablo 3.The only issue I have had with it is it says it has a combo headphone/microphone jack, but my headphones do not work with it.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Review", "Author": "timothy kilyungu", "ReviewID": "R37FWXVWN16HNX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop specifications were as intended and its awesome!In terms of performance its quite good esp with the 8GB ram and 1tb harddisk.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Just Win8 I hate!", "Author": "kimb", "ReviewID": "R2C9SXM0F6387T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The laptop runs great, but I'll likely be purchasing a copy of Win7. Everything about Win8 frustrates me, don't move your mouse to quickly or the secondary screen options pop up. Also, navigate through the apps to find Microsoft office, and no you cannot add it to the desktop without jumping through 15 steps in perfect order. Ugh. The laptop itself is perfect for the price and allows me to be mobile around my house, as I hate sitting in one room while writing my psych papers. Battery life is fantastic as well.", "Date": "May 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Service But...", "Author": "puffdragon", "ReviewID": "RJDEJ5GE45CWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the first PC I owned in 6 years, so I am a bit biased. However, I needed it for work. Ordering and getting it started was great, but it had trouble downloading things as simple as Java. I called the manufacture, was transferred at least 5 times and talked to 8 different people. I would suggest just to go through their warranty department. The other ones either don't know what you are talking about or want to charge to fix a BRAND NEW computer.

It also kept shutting itself off randomly (not because the battery was low).Lenovo service and techs were very helpful and attentive with updates and recovery options but I am still very disappointed and frustrated that the brand new laptop (my first laptop)did not operate properly. So sending it back to their repair center was my only option left.Having to pay to ship the computer for repairs that are under warranty was also made me very unhappy (they are only paying to return it to me).  But I guess when buying online that is the price to pay (maybe even stores make you send it back to original manufacturer).I certainly hope there are no continuing issues when I get this laptop back.Nothing to do with the PC itself but Windows 8.1 sure is different than XP.", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Works great except for battery", "Author": "Adam Ziemkowski", "ReviewID": "RRTBW7E7G2T09", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Everything is working well.

I tried to find a way to \"downgrade\" back to Windows 7, but I couldn't. One of my friends with a Lenovo laptop says that he can't watch Netflix without the Netflix app now and I'm just waiting for my computer to update to that. Also, the side bar pops up for no reason whatsoever and the DVD app keeps popping up for no reason. Also, when I do try and use it I can never navigate through the DVD the way I want to. I didn't research this when I purchased the Lenovo laptop, but there are no hotkeys for the media player. I know I'm just being picky now, but when I'm in a game or I'm navigating through a website I don't like to switch applications to change the song. This last part is just my personal preference, but I hope Lenovo can change this in the future.I was, however, very surprised that I can play Counter-Strike: Global Offense, Metro 2033, and Killing Floor with little to no isssues (and the majority of the issues are my internet).", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "no more lenovo.", "Author": "Kitae Lee", "ReviewID": "R1WJ9VOZQ5L95P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "poor support by lenovo when downgrade to windows 7.drivers crashed all the time and slow into blue screen.Many complaints about the issues - wlan and video issues, but lenovo seems no care at all.I have three more lenovo products including tablet pc 2 and x201 t. they are also garbages except for x201t which was good.
