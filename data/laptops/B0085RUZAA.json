I like the battery bulge on the bottom as it makes it easier to get it out of my  case. Excellent key board and screen, and as fast as I need to do my work. I am not a techy or a gamer, I can't speak to the graphics or the speed needed for gaming.This is my 3rd laptop and the best I have ever used. The price was right and I would recommend this to a friend. I am very happy with the fact it came with windows 7as I have widows 8 on my desktop and I don't like the new system.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "It works good so far", "Author": "Kristin G. Godo", "ReviewID": "R2LZFJKXH2LC7P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So far Windows 7 has fired up and is working.  I have uploaded all my files from a USB drive. But I haven't decided which anti virus to use yet.  It let me put off that decission until later.I like the way that the fan is situated over the CPU and the way the vents are designed.  I hope that this design will not cause a lint buildup over time that causes overheating.  It looks well designed and open to the air. The fan is quiet and doesn't blow much air.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "happy", "Author": "mcfly", "ReviewID": "R3IN956UJKE39C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "very happy with laptop...

Amazon, Barnes and Noble, Netflix, and Yahoo Mail. After restarting, you may finally load a page. Then, it will shut down in the middle of what you are trying to do. Very time consuming and frustrating. I tried Firefox and no improvement. I had limited time to play with this and was too patient.
