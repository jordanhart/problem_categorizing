The finger scan for passwords, fantastic. I have not mastered the Leap Motion but I am working on it. I was so worried about Windows 8, with all the reviews saying they hate it. But I am finding I love it too. My last HP laptop lasted 7 years and is still running just slow. Hoping this one lasts as long. The easy transfer program for transfer of files is great. I bought the transfer cord and it's working out.", "Date": "October 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Bought it for my husband for Christmas", "Author": "Debora Hanssen", "ReviewID": "R25KL5FFAA13I4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It was the worst gift I've ever given him!  He has a laptop and the Windows 8 really only seems to work well with the touch screen computers.  It's been about 5 months now and we are about ready to toss this piece of junk out and buy a new one.  Last night while he was doing some work remotely, the computer screen went completely blank and he hasn't been able to get it back up since.  I think it's giving me a bigger headache because I have to hear him complain NONSTOP about what a big, expensive piece of garbage this computer is!!!  BE CAUTIOUS BEFORE PURCHASING!!", "Date": "April 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good For About Two Months", "Author": "Sherma Cools", "ReviewID": "R2I1APSJJH8R8F", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This computer was great for  about two months then...bam! its goes to crap.The Plus, the fingerprint sign in and the smart pass for websites is cool. Smart pass is assigning a website to a finger. For instance, my pointer finger pulls up my email webpage, my middle pulls up my amazon webpage and so forth.However, as I currently type, I am packaging the laptop to send back to hp to fix because after updating windows 8 the whole thing crashed.  the screen went black and never came back on again even though the power button is on and the charger light is lit. I tried to return to amazon but i was a month past the window of return. My theory is, if this is the trouble i'm getting this early in the game then i would hate to think of what waits for me down the line.I would suggest you get another laptop period.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Screen + Operating System", "Author": "Paula Mejia \"-Paula\"", "ReviewID": "R2DQBDM5XNDGP9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Screen is way too big to be functional for a laptop.
