I DID NOT IMMEDIATELY NOTICE UNTIL I HAD CHANCE TO REALLY LOOK AT MACHINE.  ON IT IS  NOT WINDOWS 7 PREMIUM AS SPECIFIED.

IN MY MIND THAT WAS GENEROUS SEEING THE SEVERAL WEEKS THAT PASSED SINCE ANY REPLY TO MY ADMITTEDLY  LATE FEEDBACK TO AND LACK OF REPLY FROM SELLER.  FRANKLY, ONE OF MY HIPS WAS PAINFULLY DETERIORATING WHEN I RECEIVED THE MACHINE. REALLY FOLKS YOU GO FROM A CANE TO A WALKER VERY QUICKLY... THIS RESULTED IN A TRIP TO THE HOSPITAL TO HAVE A TOTAL HIP REPLACEMENT.  I AM CURRENTLY IN WHAT IS CALLED A SUB-ACUTE NURSING HOME CARE REHABBING AND FACING A MUCH MORE SERIOUS SURGERY. I HAVE  LITTLE PATIENCE FOR A VENDOR WHO IS UNWILLING TO LIVE UP TO THEIR WORD. THEY WILL NOTE THE RETURN DATE AND THAT RULES ARE RULES BUT NEVER WHAT THEY PR0VIDED OR THEIR LACKLUSTER REPLY.

Stevens", "ReviewID": "R11QQ8QX99KOGO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Received my order within four days and well packaged for an electronic item.  I appreciate this type of service from a vendor.  My refurbished laptop came with an actual OS Windows 7 Home CD, necessary for rebooting if required.  Took me 45 minutes to establish setup, connect to my wi-fi and download free updates to both the antivirus and Windows systems.  Additionally, the laptop came with 3 gigs of RAM verses 2 and this HP really moves fast with Windows 7 OS.  This was purchased for my 6th Grader so she could do homework, connect to a home wireless printer, and watch DVDs.  (Note, even with a parental control software program loaded to the laptop it still runs quick.)  Potential drawbacks would be the small hard drive (160 gigs) and the lack of a built in webcam, both of which can be mitigated with external devices.  For less than $200 it was a great buy.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent Decision", "Author": "RidgeviewSales", "ReviewID": "R2AYIBAVKNS3TP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Not wanting to go to the new Microsoft computer program, I needed a computer for a recent road trip trade show, I couldn't believe that if I bought a NEW computer (laptop) I would have to go with the new software.  Even the Best Buy salespeople said no one likes the new Microsoft program software - so I set out looking at buying a \"used\" computer, with Windows Seven.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and condition of this purchase.  The unit I got was functional and in great shape.  I would recommend this company for their ability to refurbish and deliver an excellent value product.  This was just what I needed.

Windows 7 was loaded but not setup, which is great. A couple bloatware items on the desktop, but easily removed those programs.Battery life is A+, we got almost 3 Hours off the battery, that is actually pretty good, considering this was a refurb.Came with 2gb of ram and 150gb HDD as advertised.Screen is nice and easy on the eyes, no blemishes, no dead pixels.Shell is great and gives the laptop a nice sturdy feel.Overall this laptop was great, perfect for my girlfriend to browse the web, do her homework, and its pretty snappy for Office. She has a beastly desktop for other things. I will be upgrading to 4 or 8gb of ram, I will probably run with 4 because the OS is 32-bit, and I would have to get another copy of Windows 7 if i went with 8 to utlize the ram completely, as with 4, the dedicated onboard GPU will use the 512mb of ram the OS does not see.Oh, and the packaging was VERY unique, it was laid flat in a special box, and there was some very tight clear wrap with very sticky edges used to hold it down to the cardboard, and then the cardboard around the laptop was folded up and it made a box around the laptop - pretty awesome to keep it from bouncing around and keep it safe.A+ seller", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good investment", "Author": "William R.

Not sure why, but basically it was just a black screen with a cursor. Contacted them again. They sent the prepaid return label via email and shipped out the replacement very quickly. This was a lot of hassle I know. I am also aware that I bought a refurbished unit and things do go wrong.
