Don't let that be your deciding factor; you can even make it look like Windows 7.  I like the ability to (semi-easily) customize the trackpad, though the fact that the default is backwards confounds me. I LOVE the mute button, though I wish Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down were their own buttons (this is a 17\" laptop, for goodness' sake -- I  had it on my 15\"!).The bad point: (which bothers me a lot for some reason) There are NO visual indicators for NumLock or CapsLock.  It gets cumbersome when you don't notice you've hit 'CapsLock' instead of 'A' five sentences ago.The good aspects outweigh the bad overall, and this DEFINITELY beats my old laptop that can't charge, so I suggest this one.", "Date": "May 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Big screen at a very good price!", "Author": "Stefan Sommerfield", "ReviewID": "R2EQOFY99BANN5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Gateway's NE71 series, priced in the mid 300's offers excellent features, led by the 17\" screen. Processor (dual-Core) is not the fastest, but that is a price function. Works fine for most home uses, Has a dual function dvd/cd drive that will play blu-ray movies, and the screen quality is near HD quality. Getting used to the windows 8 interface, and some of the apps do not work as well as the website (E-Bay for example).Overall a good value for general home use.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Raymond E.

Armstrong", "ReviewID": "RLZ3N14IME3AS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The computer is great. I have mostly had Gateway computers because I like them. I had a Toshiba once that I loved as well but Gateway is more my style. The only thing I do not like thus far about this laptop is Windows 8. I can definitely see some great aspects to it but it is like learning a whole new operating system. I was replacing my old laptop which died on me hoping to get a similar model, which I did, with the exception of upgrading from Windows 7 to 8. The new software is so different that I am stull learning it weeks later and have not figured it all out. I am getting tired of constantly having to learn a new version of Windows ever few years!", "Date": "May 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE MY GATEWAY!", "Author": "Lady Rain", "ReviewID": "R2P3CL5E1OWW7E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As far as I'm concerned, GATEWAY is the only way to go!
