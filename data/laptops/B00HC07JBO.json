I don't think I should have to jump through hoops to make it work.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Decent for casual usage", "Author": "Larry E. Miller", "ReviewID": "R9L1S62QRCR5K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "An acceptable system for the casual, everyday ;user.  I would not recommend for gamers or power users needing fast processing for large files or graphics.  As a retired tech I'm not bothered greatly by the often slow mouse response and graphical sluggish refresh rate.I highly recommend the backlit keyboard... one of the main reasons for choosing this model.  I don't use the leap motion feature, nor do I spend more than 2% of the time in the Start environment... prefer Desktop mode.  Having a touch screen is another feature I personally don't make much use of at this time.  I still appreciate that the features are there if I decide to utilize them in the future.", "Date": "April 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Getting use to windows 8..", "Author": "sheila martin", "ReviewID": "R2REZ604S4ZCF9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this HP with it's features.I am use to Windows 7,So i am learning Windows 8 and i have to say,I like 7 better.This is a very good computer that will do anything!", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Like the things I have learned to do", "Author": "RockL", "ReviewID": "R2K2PQO3SAJTXD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Everything is so different from what I was able to do before.

I seem to have trouble logging in to a secondary Facebook or email since it keeps stopping my typing and asking for me to use my fingerprint. the touchscreen works like a charm and no problems there! I actually prefer using touch since its faster and easier than the pad. there are a lot of times my internet gets cut off on this laptop even though all other devices stay logged in and continue working. ( I have used all different browsers). leap motion is fun but still not hard to get used to.  not much use for leap motion. the sound on this is completely beautiful. clear and crisp. overall feel is nice. and battery last enough. side note* I dislike windows 8 its quiet confusing and I much prefer windows 7 but overall ill live", "Date": "June 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Purchase", "Author": "Amy Gunsaullus", "ReviewID": "R3OCT1G4ATBK66", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Leap motion works great.
