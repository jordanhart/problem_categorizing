When I first read about it, I couldn't believe it. I already have a Sony Vaio Serie Z and it's an awesome machine. It has 8gb of RAM, 128GB of SSD in RAID 0 and it's very, very light! I used to have aAsus Transformer Pad too, and I liked it very much. The problem is that I travel a lot and had to take both on my trips, and I wanted to end that.Well, the Book Trio itself is a good machine, but not that powerful. The notebook comes with 4GB of RAM and it's not expansible. There are no memory banks. The HD that comes with it runs at 5400RPM. Not that fast either, and you can't change it with a SSD one, because you'd have to open the bottom of the machine, which will avoid your warranty. So, you have what you have.Anyway, the integration between the two systems is very good. You can access the tablet content from the Windows Explorer, but to access the Windows HD from Android, both Android and Windows must be connected to the same WI-FI. It's not very light ,specially compared to my Vaio. There is this forum ([...] where people are talking about it and there has been good discussions. It's worth reading it. The battery life is good. It's holding around 5 hours of usage.Pros:- Two systems in one machine.- Very well suited for everyday use- Great integration (software and hardware)- Support team is good- Sound quality is goodCons:- A little heavy- The Notebook hardware isn't upgradable- There is no SD Card reader on the notebookI'll update this review, as I get used to it. So far, so good!", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Been waiting for this for a long time- thank you Canadian Amazon", "Author": "MC Fisher", "ReviewID": "R1R6W4C4HQNRX0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had a Transformer TF300 and used it all the time, traveling and at home.  Once I heard this was coming out, it piqued my interest.  I like Asus and need a new portable Windows computer and use Android like there is no tomorrow, this is a no-brainer.  First off, two points:1) I bought this for under $1000 on Amazon.ca (Canada), I live in the US and couldn't wait for the US release so I logged into Amazon.ca only to find that my Amazon.com login worked and it was cheaper.  Sold.2) You can make this much faster by installing a SSD in it, it boots up in 7 seconds now compared to 40, I bought a Samsung 840 EVO 250GB, cloned with the Samsung software, and swapped it out.  Another reviewer stated you can not upgrade the HDD, he was mistaken.So, on to the review.  With the faster SSD installed, the Windows computer works great, not as fast as my desktop, but it does what I want.  I even ripped and converted a Blu ray with an external BD drive just to test it, it handled it fine.  The keyboard is a small, I bought the bilingual keyboard from Canada, and the key layout is a little odd (shift keys, enter key).The Android tablet is great.  I had the TF300 so this is just like a bigger, more solid, faster, higher definition version of it.  I like the metal build as compared to my plastic TF300, it is heavier, but not much.  I would have liked to have gotten the I7-4500U instead of the I5-4200U, but it is not worth it to pay a lot more.  Look at the two CPUs compared online if you are interested, they both have the same integrated graphics and don't differ in many areas.If you are interested in upgrading the HDD, look up Transformer Book Trio SSD online and there are pictures to help out.  There are a bunch of torque screws and two under the rear rubber feet.  After they are removed, you have to pop the bottom off, prying the back center portion off the computer, mine was a pain to pop off. After that, unscrew the HDD, remove the tray, unscrew the tray, switch drives, and reverse the steps.  Oh, backup the HDD to the SSD first using the Samsung software and a USB to Sata connector.Enjoy", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tablet bricked", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3TKDTJD8QM8K0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had hard time switching between two OSs.

It did not happened!!.I can assure you that i will think very heard before buying an Asus product.Please forward my comments to Asus.Regarding the trio, it is a nice piece of machinery and an interesting concept. the combination of 2 different operating systems in one notebook is the right step towards the future, providing it works smoothly. Allas, it dose not!If you separate the tablet from the pc station while working with windows os, the tablet turns to android (as it should), but when returning it to the station you can not switch it back to windows. pressing the special keyboard won't help!The only thing you can do is shut off the pc station and the tablet (each separately), and relaunch the trio again. the problem is that since you can not switch the pc back to windows you can not shut it off normally and you have to force a shut down!!.Now thats a HUGE FAILURE!.Regarding the ASUS Tutorial-When you buy an hybrid computer one of your expectations is that you can smoothly transfer files between the tablet and the pc station, meaning between the 2 OS. unfortunately when watching the tutorial you can not, due to bad resolution, understand exactly what to do, this is herder to customers that english ls not their native language. looking for help on this issue in the E manual of the product also fails.I recommend Asus to add to the manual detailed instructions how to transfer files between the 2 OS.Thats all i have to say for now, exploring into my new trio might find some more remarks (i hope they will be good ones).", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Please check your notebook out completely", "Author": "Ron Ramseur", "ReviewID": "R1S51RNT2V918E", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I actually LOVE the tablet/notebook but I just found out over the weekend, 45 days later that the HDMI port does not work.  After updating the BIOS and doing a FULL restore it still does not work.  I'd like not to have to send it in for repairs but more than likely I'll have to do just that.

I seem to also have the screen issues others complain about; which sucks, because I bought it for a trip so I could have a computer and camera....and now that I'm on the trip, I need to use a different computer because I cannot get the display working.  I have to wait 2-3 weeks until I return home to call Asus and complain, then based on the online discussion they want me to send it in for service...so who knows when I'll see it again, if I'll get any of my data off of it, or if they just give me a new computer and I lose my data, or if they'll fix it and it'll happen again.

I have noticed that on occasion the communication between the laptop and tablet storage doesn't work, but that is solvable by using Asus Webstorage.

What sells it for me is the quintessential ASUS design philosophy of the two devices merging to make something greater than the sum of the two parts.
