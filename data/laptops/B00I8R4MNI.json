That, and the individual keys seem a little larger than I'm used to, so you find yourself having to stretch your fingers more than usual when typing. For someone with smaller hands (like my mom, who had a little bit of a hard time with it) or someone with carpal tunnel, this might not be the best choice. Otherwise, it just takes some getting used to. That being said, I was very happy to find an affordable Windows 7 laptop. It was fast,  easy to set up, not overloaded with annoying software, and I haven't had a single problem with it.", "Date": "May 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Acer Aspire", "Author": "Joanne E Slavik", "ReviewID": "R2FAIK18ONDFHA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy to set up and use Just dissapointed it didn't come with at least a version of Word Even works would have been ok", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$671.95", "Features": "Intel Pentium 3558U 1.7 GHz\n4 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "Acer Aspire NX.MFVAA.005 E1-532-4870 15.6-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51xvOxmAzaL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00I8R4MNI"}}
