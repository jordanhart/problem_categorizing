{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A featured packed fantastic computer for the money", "Author": "By Matt", "ReviewID": "R24QOYDSQTWA44", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I didn\u2019t buy this computer on Amazon but fell compelled to write a review anyway.  I bought this computer to replace my 2011 HP G7 which abruptly died without any hope of repairing it.  I was attracted to the specs, specifically the i3 processor, 10 point touchscreen, and excellent battery life.  The aluminum lid and inside portion looks and feels great, the Dell logo is metal also.Pros:- The battery life they claim is actually about right, which is amazing because every manufacturer seems to lie about it.  With moderate use and the screen brightness at 80% I got 6 hours 53 minutes, with the brightness at 100% it dropped by a hour.  The screen brightness out of the box is set below 80% so I am sure it could get the 7.4 hours they advertised.- The processor, as mentioned, is an intel i3.  Unfortunately, this chip is the 3rd generation Ivy Bridge and not the 4th generation Haswell.  Having a 2012 chip in a 2013 laptop isn\u2019t that big of a deal due to the low price of this computer.  The Haswell processors are very expensive and can only be found in higher end computers.  The i3 in this unit is very fast and can cold boot Windows 8.1 in only 16 seconds.- The screen is good quality when compared to other sub $430 laptops.  The ten point touchscreen is very responsive - I\u2019m surprised at how responsive it is.- It has 2 USB 3.0 ports and 1 USB 2.0 port which usually is the other way around on lower priced laptops.- It has a \u201cspill resistant keyboard\u201d and also bluetoothCons:- The computer only comes with 4GB of ram which I suppose is OK for light use.  But if you plan on having a over a dozen tabs open and also running other programs at the same time you should really upgrade it.  The good news is that a ram slot is open already because Dell put in one 4GB chip instead of two 2GB chips.  I ordered an extra 4GB chip so I can max out the ram.- The very top part of the screen is sightly not tucked under the bezel, I'm hoping that this is a one time defect.  I ordered a replacement.- The laptop is 100% silent except for the fan which always makes a humming sound, even if the computer is idling.  I'm also hoping this is a one-time defect but I don't know.- The video card is intel's \u201cHD Graphics 4000,\u201d which means you cant do more than light to lightly moderate gaming.  It should work well with most business applications, though.- It does not come with a SVGA monitor port, only HDMI out.Overall, I am very pleased with this laptop.  It would be great if Dell included some additional features such as a fingerprint reader, SVGA monitor port (which would permit me to use my two 19\u201d external monitors on my desk), Blu-ray drive, Windows 8 Pro, and a better GPU.  Most of these features are premium so they really aren\u2019t a deal breaker when considering buying laptops in this price range.I would encourage anyone who wants a quality touchscreen Windows 8.1 laptop that has phenomenal battery life and a fast processor to buy this computer.  The quality feels very good and the aluminum is a nice touch for a laptop in this price range.  You really cant do much better in the sub $430 market.", "Date": "December 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "very good", "Author": "vincent bufis", "ReviewID": "R38SO1B9T4IMEB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "very good so far battery life good will keep you posted only had it a month but so far very pleased with it nice size also", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "just as expected", "Author": "luke", "ReviewID": "R2SEJV78W0IGTL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "computer worked just as expected.  quick delivery, greatly out performed a competitor that i ordered another computer from at the same time.", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice Laptop", "Author": "shumandu", "ReviewID": "R1KRKJX4ZOX99V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Bought this laptop for my Grandson who is attending college. Before I gave it to him, I spent a week checking out Windows 8, updating, tweaking and burning it in.  Regarding Windows 8 not sure why so many haters, I'm 65 years old and I have owned computers with every operating system offered by Microsoft and I feel this is one of the best, not worth an upgrade from Windows 7 but, without hesitation, I would recommend Windows 8 on a new computer. The Start Screen is a nice interface for social media and quick checks of email, the full desk top is still available and, I like the new all programs screen, avoiding the annoying menu structure,  it's set up the same way I set up my control panel in Win 7. My only beef is not including a full featured word processor, come on Redmond, you can afford it!  I'll comment on screen size, 14 inches is optimal, anything larger is really best suited for desk top use not transport. I think it's too bad most of the laptops are only offered in larger screen sizes. The build is nice and attractive for this price range, a good strong hinge works well with the responsive touch screen and, sufficient keyboard. Plenty of IO with HDMI, card reader, 2 USB 3 and , USB 2 on the one side works well for mouse dongle. I found moussing with Win 8 a breeze, easy to navigate. Renting DVD's from Red Box is allot cheaper than most digital rentals so I like the included DVD drive.  Dell includes very little bloat wear, just a few system check programs that would suit a novice well and, the usual security software tryout, all easily removed. Windows Defender is all you'll need for security and it's included free. After a few driver updates, a bios update and Windows updates, Windows 8.1 installed quickly, some nice new features included.  Only four stars until I can confirm reliability, but DELL has a good reputation. I was impressed enough by this laptop to order one for another Grandson as a pre High School graduation present.  I wanted to get in on the great price before it's jacked up another $150 or more for the gen 4 chips, in my opinion, not worth it for the gain provided.", "Date": "January 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CRGJJUW"}}
