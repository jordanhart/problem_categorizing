No it does not have a touch screen but if you want a touch screen, I would recommend getting a tablet. I went from Vista to Windows 7 and did not like it so I installed a free program called Classic Shell. It gives you the old look of Vista and XP and this helps to soften the learning curve of the windows 7 and 8.1. It is about the cheapest computer that you can buy and still get a built-in disk drive.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Decent Laptop", "Author": "Dovahkiin", "ReviewID": "R1J9N7H7NDBQ47", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for a coworker.

So, in my search I came across this computer with this sentence within the description:\"Enjoy the ability to pinch, swipe, rotate or scroll through images on the display screen with a simple brush of your fingers.\"Due to the wording of this statement I mistakenly assumed this was a touchscreen. It is not. This statement is about the touchpad, not the screen itself.While there is nothing wrong with this laptop per se, I would not have purchased it had the description been more clear that this is not a touchscreen. I would have looked for another laptop either with Windows 7 or a touchscreen.12/8/13: Update: I have had this a few days and am still trying to get all the Windows 8 updates downloaded to get to Windows 8.1 (so far at 96). At this point, I am strongly considering wiping it and loading my old version of Vista.I also just discovered NO HDMI PORT! I can't believe a new laptop would be sold without HDMI!", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "toshiba a brand i trust", "Author": "raven", "ReviewID": "R3Q7C9GJ8LJEPB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't know about u .but I pretty much grew up with this brand .
