I recently gave up internet dial up service and have since come up to the latest.....I love this Dell laptop Windows 8 but probably should have bought one with touch screen but this is quiet an update for me - so will be happy with it.  I did purchase it with the number keypad because I am use to using that feature.  I felt the price was very good for this unit. It has been a challenge for me to learn Windows 8 but am determined to proof to my grown kids I can do it!  They tried to discourage me from Windows 8 thinking I would never be able to use it.  So far so good!", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$899.00", "Features": "Screen Size: 15.6\"\nScreen Resolution: 1366 x 768\nProcessor Type: Intel\nProcessor Model: i5-3210M\nProcessor Speed: 2.5GHz", "Name": "Dell 15.6\" Latitude Laptop 4GB 500GB - E5530", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41UsfEOM4jL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00BZ0VV1Q"}}
