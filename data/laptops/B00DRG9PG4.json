I was able to solve them as follows:1)  I bought a miniature usb wi-fi adapter.. B003MTTJOY2)  Using a torx screwdriver, I tightened the two centrral screws on the bottom of the laptop tightly.Along the way, I upgraded to the latest bios (downloaded from acer) and installed windows 8.1.  I am very pleased with this laptop which seems to be working perfectly.  I will update this review.

I am thinking I will buy one of these for myself since I like the new design so much.  I love the fact the touchpad is out of my way since I only use that when I do not have a mouse connected. the speed is great and the size of the touch screen is MASSIVE!!I spent a long time researching and I am a techie in IT.I have owned between 25 and 40 laptops dating back to windows 3.1 and I felt the need to write a review on this one.I am not sure why folks at best buy told me they were not going to carry this anymore, and not sure why folks complained about their purchases but I can tell you that I use the bluetooth and the wi fi heavily and there were updates that a person should apply for this laptop to get the hardware up to current driver versions.Let me just say that the website for ACER was easy to use and find my updates for my model - the R7 - I noticed there was a 571 and a 572 but mine is the 571 purchased on valentines day (talk about killing 3 birds with one stone) I am as ANAL as you can be when it comes to expecting a laptop to run fast and not hang and this thing has been flawless.so for folks who actually are going to buy this here is the plan I followed to get it up to speed out of the box.It comes with windows 8.0 so anybody who says why do I need to upgrade to 8.1 (my wife included) just needs to stay with their current piece of crap and save their money.the first thing you do is apply ALL windows updates to windows 8.0then google the free upgrade to win8.1 and in my case the upgrade went fine with just my single user account tied to my wifes HOTMAIL account.this is important for some reason since I upgraded another laptop to 8.1 and I had several local accounts and I ended up with a directory named windowsold.in this case since I was signed into microsoft and the laptop was clean it had no issues upgrading in place and removing all temp files.this thing has like a 500 gig hard drive so no worries either way...I am just saying dont screw with anything until you apply updates to 8.0 and then upgrade to 8.1.so now the OS is as new as can be then you hit the ACER website and look for drivers for your model...their site was easy to navigate.I found about 10 or 15 device drivers for example the video card, the network interface , the touchpad...you get my drift you simply download all of these to the downloads folder and extract them each to their own folder and look for the exe file to run.i have done this for years so not hard for me but i suggest you find the files and call ACER to walk you through installing.my BIOS was 2 versions behind and thats the thing I ALWAYS make sure is current.If folks have trouble doing those upgrades then it has nothing to do with the laptop, that is what I would do if I bought another name brand...everytime I buy a new device I look for firmware updates or driver updates because if they are out there then some other poor smoo had problems and the vendor had to find a fix.this is my first ACER and I had alot of others but i think this is PERFECT for me, it is a big screen and the keys really like the way I hammer on them, so far I have not seen them make a mistake that was not my fault...what else...the track pad works well if you like that but I am extremley fast with my mouse and at night i flip it in tablet mode and I actually LIKE the fact the screen is about half an inch higher in the back!  it helps me figure out where the front and back is and provides just a slight angle to deflect any reflection...I assume the engineers designed it that way.  My wife had a big laptop with 17 inch screen and hated my sons laptop that was 13 inches so I was looking for the biggest touch screen i could find, my wife did not even care, but I know her well enough to know she will love the tablet mode and if not then I got me a sweet laptop to walk around with!Hope this helps folks make a decision, it took me months to go for this thing since some folks gave it bad reviews, but i guess they were just people who did not know how to update or something.

My goal was to find something with the keyboard across the front edge and the tough pad in the back.  This FLAW in every other laptop prevented me from purchasing another after the disaster of my first laptop.  It's just more ergonomically correct to have the keyboard up front!  Anyways, I'm using it now to write this review and as long as this machine runs, I can't see myself ever getting a different one!The second best feature (after the wonderfully placed keyboard) is the tilt screen.  It can really be used in \"tablet\" mode.  Over all this is a wonderful product and I would gladly purchase it over and over again.  And if I had a problem with any replacement, I'd buy it from a different seller!UPDATE (12 Feb 2014) - I STILL love it! I'm an honest person and I can only speak for myself. I don't know what's going on with peoples wifi connections or where they are purchasing their devices, but I haven't had any issues with this device.  I am currently at my sisters house and am having no problem with my connection.  I go from home, to campus, to restaurants, and never have an issue.  I stand by the fact that if your going to purchase a laptop that cost more than some desktops, go so someone reputable so that you can get any kind of assistance you may need.  My husband has had his acer laptop since 2006 and it still works wonderfully.

I have written 2 reviews in my adult life, and this is one of them.  In short, run the other way.  I spent three days trying to get the well-known wifi issue addressed.  Short of having to replace routers at my home, offices and other places where I use wifi, there is no answer to this problem except to send the \"new\" machine in for the needed repairs/upgrade/corrective action by Acer.This is unacceptable to me and should be to you.  After being an Acer customer for nearly 20 years, I really thought it was time to move on until I saw this machine.  It's more than I usually spend on a laptop every 3 years, but I thought OK, I'll give Acer another go at it.  What a mistake.  Despite all the good and quite accurate information provided by other reviewers, nothing can save Acer from it's customer service problems.  They don't even acknowledge there's a problem, and I referenced reviews back to May 2013.  They also killed a thread on their own website about the wifi problems.The techies here and on other forums may have a work-around, but I am just a user.  I can't do much \"using\" when my machine is in transit with Acer for a two week repair.  Shame on Acer for making this unit available to retailers and online when they know it should be recalled and repaired.  Most of the world does not have dual band routers and shouldn't be coerced into buying one... or more... just because they (or windows 8) has a design flaw.The \"Eazle\" just ain't worth it.  I'm moving on to the much touted and highest rated HP Pavillion 17-e019dx for less than 1/2 the price, 17\" display and it too is a touch-screen.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "The new kid in town.", "Author": "David P", "ReviewID": "R197RGDBW6YJEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works great as a laptop, tablet and desktop.

I need not say more, because if you are considering this laptop it is likely because of the design, and you won't be disappointed.-The Screen: If you are going to be using this primarily as a media machine, you are picking the right laptop. The versatility of the screen position will help you combat any angle of glare. On a plane with tight space? No problem, just fold it into a semi-tablet. Want to watch a movie while camping with your family? Flip the screen over facing away from the keyboard and you have yourself a 15.6\" tv without having to peer past the keyboard.-The Keyboard: Most will denounce the keyboard because of the lack of wrist support, so if you are going to be writing essays and doing homework on it you may be disappointed. However, if you overlook this, the keyboard types beautifully and is near the quality of a Macbook (I said NEAR the quality) Also, the keyboard has a backlight, which I did not expect.-Double Drives: No more having to pick between a beefy Hard drive or a speedy Solid State...I have a 500GB HDD installed in the Sata port and a 128GB SSD running in the mSata port....boots quick AND stores all my music and movies.-Battery life: While not having a very high capacity battery, in addition to the large 1080p screen, I am pleasantly surprised by the battery performance of the laptop. I typically get around 5 hours of useCONS:-Wifi (it is a dealbreaker): The wifi on this computer is absolute junk. It transfers data at its own convenience, which is not very often. I've also used two different USB Wifi adapters. While they work much better than the on-board wifi, the R7 manages to hinder their performance too.-Close lid/sleep mode: If you are like me and have your laptop set to sleep after closing the lid (which I think most everybody does) you cannot rely on the lid sensor. Half of the time I close the lid the laptop will continue to stay powered on, and when it does it won't even turn the screen off. So much for the good battery life.-Screen orientation: Many times after moving the screen and using a different screen orientation, it will stay locked in that position until you restart the computer. Sometimes it won't even move into the new orientation you want in the first place-Did I mention the shoddy wifi? Oh yes, I did.-Potential to be fixed: The only real deal breaker in this cons list is the wifi, which is well documented in online forums and help communities, and apparently (to Acer customers who know more about computers than I do, it is something that could be fixed with a simple software update...yet, here we are, with awful wifi...still. Now some, or even all of these cons could be a result of Windows 8's adolescence. But Windows is as much a part of the laptop as any other detail of the computer, and it doesn't make you feel any less frustrated while dealing with the issues.So, after balancing the good and bad aspects, would I recommend this laptop for you? No. No attribute of this laptop can compensate for the crap wifi. Well, unless you are still off the grid and just use your computer for the calculator and notepad. The computers that disappoint me the most are the ones that have everything going for it, but with one fatal flaw...which is how you can sum up this computer.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Melissa Morina", "ReviewID": "RWB8OXQW6AFM0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The eisel screen is my favorite part.

And I did get that.  It was to the point where I had to use my old laptop to still do online stuff because the Wi-Fi connection isn't close enough to my home for it to catch.  I did head into town to a coffee shop with it, and boy, did the Wi-Fi run like a beauty.  I ended up ordering a new wireless card for it in hopes that it would be better and while it is better, it still doesn't want to cooperate with the local Wi-Fi signal.  But after setting up mobile hotspot, my phone data's slow connection was more reliable.Another issue that it had that I didn't see in other reviews was that when it gets shipped to you, the sender may loosen a couple screws as a failsafe for the battery not to malfunction or turn on during the shipping process.  And for the first day, I was plagued with having to be ever-so careful to not move the computer at a certain angle that won't cause it to randomly die.  It really killed the purpose that I bought it for.  I did some online research and found that if you tighten the two middle screws, it fixes the problem and it did.The other problem that I noticed is that the white kinda burns into the screen.  I accidentally moved the toolbar from the bottom to the vertical right, and saw that the keyboard, date and time was still on the screen, and it slightly annoyed me.  But, if you don't move your toolbar often, it won't bug you.Now, onto the good parts.  It is ridiculously fast.  Very responsive touch screen.  And when you adjust all of the pre-installed quirks to fit your needs, this laptop becomes perfect.  The only thing that I wish was different was the speaker positioning.  It's on the bottom of the unit and if you have it on a bed, it becomes slightly muffled, but not to the point of unbearable listening.  It is incredibly crystal clear sound, great picture.I love the ability to transform this laptop into something more convenient.  The day after I got it, I had to go to Home Depot and needed to put my son in a racing cart.  I was able to bring the laptop in, put it into display mode and have it on the handle, something akin to the Lenovo Yoga's Tent mode.  I love that it doesn't fold down completely even though I thought that I wouldn't like it.  It's perfect that I don't have to actually grip the screen and potentially damage it whilst holding it.  I was able to make it a giant book and lean it up against my wall so that I could play my game at the top of the screen and watch a video on the bottom.  I actually complained to my wife today about having to reach across \"this giant screen\" to refresh a page.The battery life is great on it.  I was able to turn on iTunes today while I did a project outside, turn iTunes all the way up, and the computer volume all the way up and rock out for several hours.  When I finally realized, \"Hey, I should plug it in, it's probably dead\", it was only at 77%. In the course of 3 hours of continuous blasting music, it only dropped 20%.All in all, once you get past the silly Wi-Fi issue, it is an amazing computer if you can land a good price on it.  Bought mine for $600 and it has been worth every single penny.  I am only giving it a 4-star though because of the Wi-Fi as that is a big part of a computer.
