{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Much nicer - HP adds some regular laptop functionality", "Author": "Gregory S. Alston \"Wolfy Dan\"", "ReviewID": "R16LQ23XK5DZUU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is probably my 5th Chromebook and my favorite has been the Samsung XE500C21.  I purchased two of the newer 11.6 Samsungs but I sold them because they felt too cheap and the things that they offered as upgrades, USB 3.0 and HDMI, were of no benefit to me.  This model brings a keyboard with an actual caps lock key, a touchpad with left and right buttons, and most importantly a removable battery.  The body of this Chromebook is identical to HPs 14 inch Sleekbook and leaves me wondering if I can one day swap out its internal parts and convert it into a regular laptop.The reason that I use Chromebooks is because my business is internet-based and a Chromebook allows me to pull over to the side of the road open it up and check my leads and keep on moving.  In the time that it takes a regular laptop to startup, I have what I need, close it and put it away - It is for instant access.  The problem that other people have with them is that they try to force the Chromebook to be a laptop and it simply is not and that is the advantage for me.  I can get what I need from the internet without having to worry about updates, viruses, malware or any of that other stuff.  If it drops or gets stolen, I can go to the closest electronics store and buy another one and continue doing what I was doing like nothing ever happened.While this laptop is smaller and lighter than most laptops, it is bigger and heavier than most Chromebooks - This is going to take some getting used to because the 12 inch screen seemed like the perfect size and was very easy to fit in a briefcase.I would also recommend this Chromebook for anyone who is prone to viruses because only software from the Google store can be installed on it, viruses can not sneak onto your computer.", "Date": "February 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "easy breezy", "Author": "Sharon Jaynes", "ReviewID": "RMBXTS5UWJS62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got it for my husband who only checks email and didn't need word processing.

The larger size works well for him to see and he has been able to navigate it very well. The system is very user friendly and lots of apps. His older sister liked his so much she asked me to get one for her and she loves it.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "I Love My Chromebook!", "Author": "Deborah Johnsom", "ReviewID": "RHCGCLTQ6SYPV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I made the tight decision to purchase the HP Chromebook.
