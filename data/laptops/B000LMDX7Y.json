I have purchased one for each of my 4 children and never regretted it. Since it is an Apple I don't have to worry about accidental clicking that could cause viruses and with the Microsoft Office 04, the kids can easily transfer their documents and projects to any pc with Office. The iBooks have been very durable and an economical alternative to the pricey pc laptops. Now with Leopard, I can monitor my kids computer time, set child/computer bedtimes, view/limit and the websites and I don't have to pay extra for this it is built in. The kids like all the games and the ability to control their laptops with voice commands. I like that I can stay in control of my kids computers without being a computer scientist.", "Date": "December 3, 2007"}, {"Title": "Pry it out of my cold dead hands!", "Author": "Margaret Picky", "ReviewID": "RGT4D1PS2R7EC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had a 12\" iBook G4 since 2005 and it's still my favorite notebook for browsing the internet, writing letters, and even reading pdf's. It's very lightweight and I consider the screen the perfect size.  It's held up very well.  One of the keys has a hairline crack and one of the rubber feet on the bottom fell off but I clean it every month or so and it still looks almost new.My only criticism is that it gets a little warm so I keep it on top of a clipboard when holding it in my lap.  No viruses, no crashes, no worries.When netbooks started becoming popular a couple of years ago, I had to laugh because I already have a lightweight, handy netbook.  In fact, I'm using it right now to write this review.  Given a choice between a new Asus or Dell netbook or a used iBook G4 for the same price, I would take the G4 without thinking about it for a second.", "Date": "June 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best for a student!!!", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R2A9OWCUPXOI5U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have recently bought a iBook G4. To tell you about it, this laptop has made me more happy than ever. I was always a Windows fanatic, but when I saw this, I got excited. This had everything, iLife, iTunes, etc. No more buying programs like anti-viruses or video editing software. Mac has it all!!!  Mine had integrated Bluetooth (good for transfering data from your cellphone), 802.11g Wireless (for on the go), and Mac OS X 10.4.11 (Which Macs are better than \"Windows\"). I compared my laptop to my other relatives' laptops. My aunt bought an HP laptop, and when she uses it, the fan blows like crazy and she isn't doing anything. The iBook didn't do that.  I could still be bragging about my Mac, but really! It's the best thing ever! I am not going back to Windows, EVER!!!, even if it was part of my childhood. I never knew that these stuff existed.", "Date": "April 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "NICE~!", "Author": "gkkim", "ReviewID": "R3DF24D2B2LVLA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this computer about a week ago and in the beginning it was not working( error was showing), but i left it for a while and it WORKED~!...  about 3 minutes). the laptop has exterior damages but it everything ran fine. its not the fastest computer out there .. but its good for taking notes, chatting (IM), and checking emails. the only problem i had was, when i try to download a programing cd it didnt work.( i didnt know the programming cd was for new computers tho, my fault). everything works! i say buy iT~! if you are only going to chat, take notes, check emails or download something!! but if you want to download parallel on the mac .. i recommend to get something else,( newer~!). BUT GREAT LAPTOP ~!", "Date": "October 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Grrrrr", "Author": "Chris", "ReviewID": "R909YEFFPADHB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So I got the laptop and its a good thing I double checked everything before I gave it to my sis (she needed something she could take to school with her for minor projects and such) because it came with what must have been a different laptops charger. It wasn't even close to being able to plug in.. A laptop isn't much good if you can't charge the battery. Luckily the replacement charger only cost like 7 bucks from a different seller, so problem solved. Buyer beware because you might not get the right parts.", "Date": "November 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Was great but its a bit outdated", "Author": "Cody", "ReviewID": "R2B6YS9M4JFPUO", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had an iBook G4 scene summer of 2011 and I have one thing to say about it, its great but its hard to find apps for. alot of apps do have PPC support but some don't, most of the new ones don't.", "Date": "January 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Well done!", "Author": "Sherilyn Brown", "ReviewID": "R2ZNUTMM2KT6Y6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm REALLY enjoying my laptop very much.

Also, the battery drains quickly with in 2hrs I was at like 39% battery health, and finally it came with the old Mac OS X 10.4 you would think it would be updated to full capability.
