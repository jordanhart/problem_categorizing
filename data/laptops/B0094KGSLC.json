This new computer definitely filled the bill and our Rector absolutely loves it and is very impressed with the ease of setting it up and that it also came with some pre-loaded software. Add this to the incredibly affordable price and you've got a winner on all counts.  Would definitely recommend this product.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Processor Intel Core i3 (2.4 GHz) Windows 7 Home Premium Edition 64-bit\nDisplay Size 15.6\" Video Card Intel HD Installed Memory 4 GB\nHard Drive Capacity 320 GB Bluetooth, Integrated 10/100 Network Card, Integrated Wireless LAN\nOptical Drive Type Dual Layer DVD\u00b1RW/DVD-RAM\nWeight 5.5 lb", "Name": "Hp 2000-354nr 15.6\" Laptop Notebook I3-370m 4gb Ram 320gb Wifi Dvdrw Webcam", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31qG8X9KNQL.jpg", "ProductID": "B0094KGSLC"}}
