{"Reviews": [{"Title": "This is an excellent netbook!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3KWTFBTV2P2QP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this acer 4gb netbook and it works perfectly. It's the perfect screen size it's not too small but not big either. It's very lightweight and I like to use this when i'm laying on the couch or in bed instead of the regular size laptop. It's small enough to place inside of kind of large purse or bag. I think this will be excellent for students to use or as a starter laptop. When I use this netbook it does everything that my regular size laptops can do. Acer really did a great job on this slim laptop.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "11.6\" 4G 320GB C-60 Black", "Name": "Acer Aspire ONE 725-0488 - 11.6\" - C-60 - Windows", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/411092Iob3L._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008HF1CDE"}}
