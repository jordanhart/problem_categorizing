I use it for basic stuff: email, internetj/research, download music and that is pretty much it. I don't game at all. This is my first laptop and you need to understand that my old computer (6 years old) was a Pentium 4, 80G HD, 512 Ram. I've had this ACER for a month now and I am more than pleased with its performance. Speed is great. Screen is great. Keyboard is great (I never have to worry about my wrists accidently hitting the house pad), mouse pad is great. I haven't tried the webcam yet. Speakers are weak but I don't use my computer to listen to music. I bought this laptop for $379.00 with free shipping in early February. Too cheap. I wonder how much the workers in Asia are being paid to make them??? :(-D", "Date": "March 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Second Acer Laptop - A Winner", "Author": "Karen", "ReviewID": "R2WIZJB9XZJ10X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Acer Laptop, my previous laptop was good but this one is great. I just use my laptop when I am traveling, it has WiFi, keyboard has a very good ease of use and the 15 in screen is wide enough that I can watch movies and work without any eye strain, battery life is good at least 3.5 hours. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good inexpensive system.", "Date": "May 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Still going", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R77WWFO40UY47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First laptop I ever bought. Paid $379 + tax on sale. Original HDD lasted just over 2 years. Still works but I got a couple errors for Disc degradation. Meaning it was wearing out. Swapped out original 320GB HDD for Crucial 240GB SSD. Speed was a noticeable difference. Swapped out 4GB DDR3 Memory to 8GB. Games worked and played better without turning off background services. Have now had this Acer 5742Z-4646 for 3 years and still works fine. No computer is perfect, yet this one has been worth maintaining and upgrading. I'm typing on it now ^-^", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "My Son", "Author": "Double E \"Double E\"", "ReviewID": "R3LDY889K2GK49", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Loves this laptop.
