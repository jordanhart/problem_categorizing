Without upgrading the CPU, it can't handle more than 8GB. I'm using it to run an experimental, Xen-based operating system that requires VT-d. I'm actually using it to type this review. The 8GB is a bit of a drag, but I can't fault the seller for that.There is one issue that I could fault the seller for, but it's a non-issue for me. This was supposed to ship with a 250GB hard drive, but it was only 225GB. I replaced it with a 500GB hard drive when I first received it, so it was a non-issue for me and I didn't remove a star for it (plus, it's only a 25GB discrepancy).Also, for anyone suggesting I don't know how to properly check the size of a hard drive and that I was looking at the partition size, fdisk reported the drive capacity at 225GB. The sticker on the hard drive itself says it's 225GB.", "Date": "May 29, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BFX4UJI"}}
