I was a bit worried about the weight and size, but overall it is very nice.Pros:Large, full keyboard with big keys.beautiful 16 inch HD screen, very impressive.Excellent processor, Hard Drive, graphics card, and webcam.Nice touchpad (besides the buttons).Cons:Touchpad buttons suck, very large and clunky.This sucker is heavy!Finish picks up a lot of finger prints, smudges.Status lights are tiny with bad labels.Volume wheel looks like it could be broke off easily.", "Date": "November 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Decent for the price!", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"ArmyStrongLove\"", "ReviewID": "RYXK6VB3PF44Z", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Initially I purchased a dell laptop at Walmart, being in a rush. After less than 30 days the dell videocard/motherboard/lcd and many other things malfunctioned and needed to be repaired. Walmart after much hesitation refunded me every penny and I left and went to look into another laptop/brand. I read high raves about Toshiba and Asus laptops so I kinda had my heart set on a Toshiba. I went to Best Buy where they weren't very helpful, no one said a word to me even walking around with cash in hand and intent on buying something. I liked having the controls on the top of the keyboard for playing, pausing, FF/RW, as well as Volume/Mute Controls. The volume wheel does feel like it might break easily if messed with a lot or bumped so I plan on being delicate with it.The volume level leaves MUCH to be desired, its rather quiet for my taste. Mine came loaded with Windows 7, we will see how that goes.The keyboard takes some getting used to as it feels cramped when you are used to a full dedicated keyboard without 10key. So far the display is crysal clear, videos and switching between tasks has been seamless.Webcam only works if you have a ton of lighting around which is slightly disappointing.For the price, its not bad.Warranty and service so far seems adequate.", "Date": "November 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice keyboard/screen, Internet/browser problems", "Author": "R. Daoudi", "ReviewID": "R2ZBJ2SYIJHOPK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was able to purchase this computer at Best Buy for $500, slightly less than Amazon. The computer is light, has a nice size screen and the keyboard is sleek and easier than most to type on. Also, there is a little roller at the front of the computer that allows you to manipulate the volume with your finger. Most laptops do not have the ability to do this which was a main selling feature for me. The only problem is that the speakers are weak so if you use a lot of sound, but separate speakers. The battery does last a decent amount of time.I have to say I am pretty annoyed with this computer right now because both IE and Mozilla constantly crash on me. They browser freezes up at least 5-7 times a day and requires me to close out. But when I go back to IE, it does take me back to all the pages I was on when it crashed. Also, my home Internet signal works fine yet the computer loses the signal and stalls out a few times a day. And after it finds the connection again this piece of crap takes forever to get to the Internet.Overall it is a good computer but knowing what I know I am absolutely would NOT buy this computer. I would pay a little extra for a faster, stronger computer. I may send it in to be fixed under the limited warranty but the problems I have seem to be ones that would be hard to identify and fix.", "Date": "December 31, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for media use.", "Author": "eh8789", "ReviewID": "R1NEMK3RE2JD57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:-Buttons aren't too big or too small-Nice, big 16\" 720p screen-Easy access-Built-in Wireless adapter-Realtek HD Audio is good for headphone or additional speaker use-Excellent for watching videos-Plenty of RAM and HDD space-SD card slotCons:-Volume adjuster is a bit too retro-Speakers doesn't have a very good quality, compared to other Toshiba laptops-Not made for heavy video gaming(setting graphics to max)-Only 2 USB portsGood working laptop, for media use; not able to keep up on the latest video games, if you set the graphics too high; recommend low graphic settings.Not a lot of bass on the speakers; I recommend using additional speakers or headphones, if you want a good experience when listening to music or watching videos.I won't say anything about the touchpad, since I rarely use touchpads.  However, setting up the touchpad can be fun.  I'll never guess there being a option that adds inertia to the cursor, when using the touchpad, and bounces off the edges of the screen, if I didn't see it on there.", "Date": "April 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Excelente precio-valor", "Author": "Rodrigo A. Montilla", "ReviewID": "R31L8XENVSIB9M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Compr\u00e9 este equipo y en mi opini\u00f3n es una port\u00e1til que reune buenas caracter\u00edsticas. Por ejemplo, la pantalla de 16 pulgadas se ve excelente, la tarjeta gr\u00e1fica es de lo mejor. Con ella he podido correr juegos que requieren muchos recursos de memoria y video y los juego sin ninguna novedad.Con respecto al procesador, lo considero bastante r\u00e1pido, la capacidad del disco duro, apropiada.Es dise\u00f1o y el acabado es elegante si no se ensucia, el peso es regular, no calienta mucho pero si no quieres que se caliente, puedes usar las bases de ventiladores externos de esos que venden en las tiendas de computaci\u00f3n.Lo \u00fanico malo es que el acabado del case y del teclado hace que se marquen mucho con las huellas de los dedos y manos. Hay que estarle pasando un pa\u00f1o sutil para dejarla como nueva.Otra cosa buena de este equipo es que trae incorporado el teclado num\u00e9rico como en las desktop, lo cual facilita las operaciones matem\u00e1ticas, por ejemplo.En resumen, recomiendo esta laptop por su precio, por sus caracter\u00edsticas y por el respaldo de la marca.", "Date": "December 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Toshiba laptop", "Author": "Flyer \"greyt\"", "ReviewID": "RBO0T46KE0LNX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Takes time to get used to Windows 7.  Touchpad is so sensitive that I will use a mouse.  Disabled the zoom function on the touchpad because the font size changed so easily. Other than that, the screen is perfect - good size, bright and clear.  Keys are large enough for most fingers, and having the ten-key on the right side of the keyboard is very handy for those of us who work with numbers.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent Laptop.", "Author": "Krishna Bollampally", "ReviewID": "R1F95EKUDQCCZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am happy with the performance of this laptop.

The keyboard has a nice feel, the response time is good, and the touchpad is fairly easy to use, although I did purchase a wireless mouse to go with it.

The screen is easy to see, the key board is great, EXCEPT for the touch pad. It is awkwardly located to the left and I don't like it. Bought a Toshiba \"mini mouse\" and like that much better. It is fast, windows 7 is good. The speakers are junk. You will need external speakers to get decent sound out of it. I don't think it is too heavy.I have had no problems with the internet (I have an ATT DSL modem).
