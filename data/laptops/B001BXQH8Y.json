{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Not what it says in description!!!!!!!!!!", "Author": "Cheryl  S.", "ReviewID": "R2XLOZFKIUICA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I think it is very deceptive that in the description from Amazon, it states 4GB BUT it only comes with 1GB from the seller.  How can you feel good about yourself and sell something so misleading BUT then the seller will sell you some more GB for extra money.  I am sure that are several other things in it that I am not aware of.  That is what I get for buying something like a computer from you!  Really makes me think about buying anything from Amazon again.  I have always in the past bought alot of Amazon but I am pissed!", "Date": "February 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good quality product & service", "Author": "Larry Goldberg \"RedwoodLarry\"", "ReviewID": "R1FYOL2200IXGJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received the computer within the time frame projected (about a week via standard shipping during Christmas holiday season).  My wife loves it and it's performing exactly as specified.  I chose this product from this vendor because it came bundled with valuable software (MS Office and latest OS) at no extra charge.  They also were accurate with the listed condition (very good).  I'm very satisfied with the order and performance of the seller.", "Date": "January 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Amazon azienda super affidabile", "Author": "vincenzi giuseppe", "ReviewID": "R2W9K66OGMOT2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "il prodotto recentemente acquistato  e ottimo in Italia non c'era con questa carateristiche sono contento di aver acquistato un prodotto negli USA in particolare su questo sito Azienda seria qualitativa  ed affidabile vale la pena di acquistare perch\u00e8 sai che l'azienda e affidabile ci vorebbero pi\u00f9 aziende serie anche in Italia tra l'altro i prezzi sono pi\u00f9 competitivi che io ho potuto riscontrare nel Web distinti saluti vincenzi.giuseppe@alice.it al pi\u00f9 presto per altri acquisti grazie", "Date": "November 10, 2008"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": ".1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM , 160GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm\nCombo Drive (DVD-ROM/CD-RW), Intel GMA X3100 graphics, 13.3-inch (diagonal) glossy TFT\nBuilt-in 10/100/1000BASE-T (Gigabit) Ethernet, AirPort Extreme Wi-Fi (based on IEEE 802.11n draft specification);\nBuilt-in iSight camera; mini-DVI output port with support for DVI, VGA, S-video, and composite video\nMac OS X v10.5 Leopard , 1 year warranty", "Name": "Apple MacBook White- 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB DDR2 , 250GB SATA HD, Combo Drive (DVD-ROM/CD-RW), Intel GMA X3100 graphics, Built-in iSight camera; mini-DVI output port with support for DVI, VGA, S-video, and composite video , 13.3\" (diagonal) glossy TFT, Built-in 10/100/1000BASE-T (Gigabit) Ethernet, AirPort Extreme Wi-Fi (based on IEEE 802.11n draft specification); built-in Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR (Enhanced Data Rate) module, Mac OS X v10.5 Leopard", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51%2Bmx9lZUML._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001BXQH8Y"}}
