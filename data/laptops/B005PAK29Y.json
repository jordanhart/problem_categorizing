{"Reviews": [{"Title": "I've Had a Great Experience So Far!", "Author": "Watching", "ReviewID": "R2ZBR3YA3RWK6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm somewhat surprised by the other reviewers having problems as they have. I have had mine for almost 3 months and I have no big issues. The touch pad does take some getting used to but mine doesn't need excessive pressure. The one thing it does occasionally is go into zoom mode accidentally, but I think it's caused by touching it at more than one place while typing. I went in to the options and set it up like I like it when it was days old. The keyboard is reasonably good for me. It's not the best I've ever tried, but it is far from the worst and I prefer it to the HP and the Acer that are also in my household. I like the Mac keyboard my daughter has a little better.I don't have any other issues. I bought mine from one of the large vendors that allow you to customize the laptop when you buy it. I put a 120GB SSD in lieu of the standard primary drive and  a 750GB 7200 RPM unit as the secondary drive. I deleted the Blu-Ray burner and replaced it with a cheaper Blu-Ray player to cut the cost a little bit and because I don't anticipate burning Blu-Ray discs. I don't remember the other changes, but there were a few. I have 8GB of RAM, but slightly better than the original. I had the software installed by the vendor after the changes were made, without putting all the ASUS bloatware back in.The monitor is very, very good. I had a previous ASUS (M70) with the same resolution but the colors were washed out on that one when watching movies or playing games. This one is fabulous. Everyone who tries it is very impressed. I like the way it gets rid of heat. I would prefer a different 12V connection because I like to hold it between my legs in a recliner occasionally and it sticks out in the way. The Mac solution is the best and I don't know why all vendors don't do something similar. Oh, yeah, the touch pad is getting shiny where I use it all the time. I've only played one game on it: Sniper- Ghost Warrior. It runs it at max settings without problems and it is beautiful. It is awkward to use this touch pad for gaming and I would prefer a mouse if I wasn't sitting in my recliner. Because of back problems, I can't sit upright in a different chair for long periods playing games, so for me I just make do. I might try some kind of a game controller.I hope that this helps some of you to see that not all are dissatisfied.", "Date": "February 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "antiraza", "ReviewID": "R1W5VFQWW28GQR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unfortunate that other folks have had negative experiences. I have not.I've had mine for about 9 months now, I use it as a professional 'moving-workstation', doing a lot of heavy creative development work, (Adobe Suite, 3D graphics, Motion Tracking etc.)Hardware: A+. The GFX card combined with the generous default RAM and Processor set up have enabled me to do everything I need to, and I do some fairly heavy duty graphics work. The monitor is bright and crisp. I recently upgraded the machine to 16GB ram and it is now performing even better. I have done some 3D gaming on the machine and it holds up comparably to its specs. The 1TB harddrive has been more than enough for my needs. I considered swapping it out for an SSD, but at this point the extra space is more valuable than the speed.Sound: Good enough. I don't watch movies that much on it, but when I do, the sound is good. I have only used the subwoofer attachment once, because I don't think it added enough value to merit carrying it around.Nits: The keyboard could be better. I love having a full keyboard with num-pad, because I can do a lot of shortcut key work using the num pad, but I do wish it could have had chicklet style keys (not possible with this screen size and also including a numpad, they did the best they could given the form factor).The trackpad multi touch is good but not Apple good. I hate Apple stuff for a lot of reasons, but they are simply the leaders in multi-touch responsiveness and reliability. Asus gets close with this, and the multitouch is functional and adds a lot of efficiency. It's reliable, but it's not delightful.The DVD eject button is very difficult to press, I usually have to lift the machine up and look at the button to find it before I can press it. However, I honestly have only needed optical media a handful of times since I got the machine.There is a fair amount of bloatware, but I have not uninstalled it as they all seem to be serving a valuable purpose (eg. USB charging when the machine is off, Instant On and battery management).The glossy lid material sucks. It's a fingerprint magnet. I do wish it was matte.It is not a very solid feeling machine (eg. an aluminium MBP), it feels plastic in the lid area, but it is actually quite solid. It has held up fine (no drops or abuse at my end, but I do travel a lot by plane (including international travel), and it has taken all that moving around without so much as a ding or scratch)./NitsThe keys on the left hand side that shortcut to various items do not bother me. I rarely press them accidentally (as they are too stiff to do so), but I also only use the volume control keys and the rest just take up space.Instant On is very reliable and works excellently. I love it.HDMI out is a great +, and have used it often. USB 3 and the USB always-on charger port have also been great things to have. My phone died while I was out on a job in the middle of a chaotic environment, ran a cable from my backpack into my pocket, and made it through the rest of the day. Got on a plane and my phone was near dead, plugged it in and napped through the flight, disembarked with a fully charged phone and barely a dent in my battery life on the laptop.Heat management is quite good. It runs hot when the GPU really goes to work, as you would expect, but even then it is not so hot as to be uncomfortable to hold on your lap while working. During normal use the temperature is nominal.The power management is fairly good, I get 5-6 hrs of regular use, 2-3 hours of heavy use (Video editing etc.) Standby seems to last forever... Long enough for a regular use machine If you are looking for a machine with a longer battery life, you would need to compromise on power and weight. This is a good balance of power, weight and battery life. I love the fact that the battery does not charge if it is plugged in and the level is >97%. Thank you ASUS for protecting me from unnecessary battery decay.It's not light, it's not unbearably heavy. It is not a light machine, but again, this is a powerful workstation, and so portability is sacrificed slightly.Overall, and for the cost, if you need a gaming rig or a 3d/2d graphics workstation on a budget, and are willing to making some partial sacrifices in the battery life and scale departments, this machine simply cannot be beat. I have a MacBook Pro from my office and I absolutely loath using it for graphics work as opposed to this bad boy, it is SO much snappier and more stable.Why then, a 4 star review and not 5 stars?1) Glossy lid, matte would have made my machine look cleaner and feel cleaner.2) Not chicklet style keyboard (I know it would not have been possible, but I still wish for it).3) More more more more/Less less less less. More battery life. Less weight. Possible? Probably not, but again, I wish for it.4) I wish the multitouch was more 'delightful' to use (but it is fully usable in its current state).", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "ASUS N75SF:  A Disappointment", "Author": "R. Poole", "ReviewID": "ROOP3AS8OVHKK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was so looking forward to this laptop computer after researching it.  It seemed to excel compared with competitors.  However, it didn't live up to expectations:Pros:Looks stylish, very bright/sharp monitor, huge touchpad that with one slide of the fingertip moves the cursor the whole length/width of the screen, sound is excellent with high volume potential, pretty light for its size, runs cool and speed of operation is fast.Cons:The touchpad can also be a negative because there is no defining border to know when you are going to touch it; being so large on the palm-rest area, my palms brushed it often and it interferred with my typing unless I turned it off.The keys, even though they look nice, are flat with little space between them, which I found messed-up my keystrokes (I would tick a bordering key by mistake).  Additionally, certain keys would not register unless I used excessive pressure; again, messing-up my keystroke rhythm.The Asus software had some moderate compatibility problems working with Windows 7.  I did 3 factory restores and still had OS conflicts.  I ran a test on the OS and found Asus made changes to Windows 7 (to accommodate their programs, I guess) and 3 corrupted Asus files were identified, which cannot be replaced manually and Windows 7 could not fix them (you can read about it on the web if you research this problem with this particular model).  The solution recommended from a forum was to install a clean version of Windows 7 (which can be downloaded from a European website) and use the Windows 7 authorization key on the underside of the laptop to activate it.  I didn't try it so I don't know if it would work or how it would affect the integrated Asus programs.Another suggestion was to phone Asus tech support to ask if they had a patch to correct the problem, which seemed easy enough.  I wanted to also contact them about the keystroke pressure/registering inconsistencies.  However, I could not find a USA support number on their website.  As an alternative, I used their website to send a detailed message requesting support (twice, actually).  I never did get a reply.  Therefore, even though the warranty sounds great, if there is no tech support follow-up/follow-though, it is worthless.I concluded there were irresolvable defects, so I returned the laptop to Amazon for a refund.By the way, I ordered through Amazon on a Saturday morning and my computer was delivered on Monday morning....Wow, the free shipping for this product from Arizona to SF Bay Area was fast!", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "Almost perfect, were it not for nVidia Optimus", "Author": "B. Brockmeier", "ReviewID": "RR14LXXMHIBP7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was shopping for a new laptop a while ago, and happened to find this one.  It had everything I was looking for:1.  Recent Intel Chipset2.  nVidia Graphics3.  1920x1080 display4.  Full 10-Key number pad5.  Good speakers6.  8 gigabytes of RAM7.  4 USB Ports8.  802.11N WiFi standardThis laptop has been doing most of what I wanted it to, which includes video viewing, web-surfing, network management, and some gaming (still meaning to try virtual machines).  However, the place where this laptop falls short is the fact that it has nVidia Optimus Technology, which means that nVidia is providing no Linux support for this laptop.  Had I know about the Optimus issue, and that the Optimus technology was in this laptop, I would have went with a different one.  I have got proper 3D Acceleration with IronHide (and previously BumbleBee), but actual nVidia support would be twice as fast, if not more.  It is better than my old laptop (nVidia GeForce 9800M), but only by a hair.  Games I've run (which all run at least decent) include Doom3, Quake 3, Wolfenstein:  Enemy Territory, MineCraft, Nexuiz, Smokin' Guns, and Tile Racer.The battery life, while not terrible, isn't as good as other laptops I've used.  I didn't run the battery down, but the report from Ubuntu 12.04 was that I had roughly an hour and fourty-nine minutes.  If I had turned the brightness down, and turned off the WiFi, I probably could have got 4 hours though.The speakers on this thing are awesome; they are much louder than my old Asus G50V.  The laptop also came with its own portable sub-woofer, which I still need to try.  Another improvement over the G50V is that the headphone port isn't finicky; you don't have to find the right spot for sound to go to headphones.The display is really good too, nice and bright, 1920x1080.  Not much else to say there.The Intel Core i7 processor is an eight core CPU, which I have yet to tax.  I can't wait to see how well it handles virtual machines.Touch pad works, but because it isn't exactly \"defined.\"  There are just two slits on the side, nothing at the top to determine when it ends/begins.  It is difficult to determine when I'm using the vertical scroll on the bar, or just fumbling on surface.Also, two of the USB ports are 3.0 standard, but I don't have any USB 3.0 devices to test them with.  However, I've noticed that those two ports don't always work, and it is random.  Sometimes it will work on (re)boot, or quit on wake.  The USB 2.0 ports seem to always work.Other features:Blu-Ray Drive1280x720 WebCamSummaryGood:  Intel Core i7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, Speakers, Display, Two 500GB hard drivesBad:  No proper nVidia support (not an issue if you use Windows, but a major problem for Linux Gamers), short battery life, finicky USB 3.0 portIndifferent:  Blu-Ray Drive", "Date": "July 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Buyer Beware", "Author": "Overquoted", "ReviewID": "R53VYD15OZ872", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have edited this review multiple times out of a sense of fairness. After all, things go wrong sometimes. A single piece of faulty hardware does not implicate an entire line. But terrible warranty repair? Multiple times? A driver issue that many customers have and Asus cannot or will not fix? I am so angry at this point that I am opening a case with the BBB. Asus has gone beyond bad service into actually damaging whatever value is left in my laptop. I shall spend the semester saving money to buy a brand new $1000+ laptop I can ill-afford just to replace this utter piece of crap.Straight of the box, the NS7SF is pretty awesome. The only complaint I had was the touchpad, which had buttons chosen for aesthetics without regard for how much pressure is required to use them. But the screen was brilliantly vivid; whites were bright enough to require a lowering of the brightness and blacks were pitch-black even at the highest brightness settings. The videocard ran modern games like Left 4 Dead 2 on high settings without overheating. And the sound was fantastic, even without the sub-woofer. A friend of mine walked into my living room and thought I was playing music from my tv instead of the N75SF. There really wasn't anything I wasn't satisfied with aside from the touchpad. Even the case seemed sturdy; unlike my previous laptop, the back of the LCD panel didn't bend inward if I happened to place something on top of it.This lasted until the USB ports started having issues with a half-dozen different devices. Code 10 error after using them once and then plugging them back in later. The only way to fix it was to restart the entire system. Kind of a pain if you are multi-tasking and just need to do one small thing on a USB device. I tried multiple factory resets without any change. Eventually, I RMA'ed it. But this was only after the power-harness became so loose I had to fight with the jack to get it to charge. This all by April, and I bought the laptop in October.So, Asus pays for the shipping to/from the RMA center and are pretty quick about it, too. Maybe two weeks, including shipping time. But when I get it, I find out that the harness is still slightly loose, though not nearly as bad; I suspect I will run into the exact same power issue within six months, however. The motherboard was replaced, but didn't fix the USB issues (meaning it was a driver issue that Asus *somehow* was unaware of up until then). They also replaced a speaker somewhere because I was having issues with the sound disappearing, but there's no telling if it was hardware or driver.Finally, they replaced the LCD screen. This was neither desired nor requested by me. They saw some problems with the screen (a few small bright spots that had never bothered me because they were only visible against extremely light backgrounds). That, initially, seemed quite lovely. They saw a problem and took proactive action, right? Wrong. They replaced the screen with a substandard, non-stock model. This screen was duller than the $300 Compaq screen in my old laptop. It lacked any vividness and whites were not white, but grey. I was furious, but I was busy with moving.Fast forward less than a month, the day before a trip to the city I was moving to, and the LCD screen fails entirely. Would not come on at all. Obviously, Asus is using refurbished parts, regardless of their condition, to satisfy their warranties. So it gets sent in again. I get it back fairly quickly and they've replaced it with a slightly different LCD model, but at least it's somewhat comparable. It's not as bright and reflects like a mirror (unlike the original), but at least it's brighter than the Compaq laptop (unlike the first replacement). But it's also refurbished since it came stock with dead pixels. I also just absolutely love that they managed to break the speaker plate above the keyboard; neither end will stay down now.So, to reiterate, Asus first tried using a sub-standard, non-stock replacement part for an undesired and unrequested repair. When that part failed, they went with a better model (but still refurbished) replacement part, but broke a part of the laptop before sending it back to me. My $1300 was certainly money well spent; multiple reinstallations, multiple RMA's, and at the end of the day, I still have a slightly broken laptop.That said, if the only thing you care about is a very quick warranty service that will get your laptop functioning enough to use (even if only for a little while), Asus is perfect.I give props to their (I suspect foreign) customer service representatives (I contacted them through e-mail). They were always very polite, even when my temper was frayed. But that is absolutely the only positive thing I can say about my experience with Asus.", "Date": "February 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Wow... Great PC!", "Author": "K.H.", "ReviewID": "R3QDQ1JTDS81X3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, I'd like to say that this is my fist Asus product. Before, all my computers had been HP's. While researching, I was looking for a couple main things: primarily a powerful GPU, ample storage space, a fast HD, plenty of RAM, and a Core i7 CPU. Now I'll break it down into categories.Aesthetics:The screen is HUGE. 17.3 inches is amazing, and it is incredibly vibrant. The native 1920 x 1080 resolution is amazing - it really is \"True HD\". So far, I've tried Netflix, YouTube and Vimeo, all at HD, and they look beautiful. The laptop itself is quite big and heavy, but that's what you would expect since it is 17.3\". The lid closes nicely, too. I love where the ventilation is placed, since my last computer had the vent on the bottom, and it would burn my lap. The vent on the side is very convenient, and is great.Ports: This computer has 2x USB 2.0 ports, 2x USB 3.0 ports which are 10x faster. There are two on each side, which is nice if you like a mouse. There is also an HDMI output port (perfect for TV), VGA output, a multi-card reader, headphone and mic jacks, and an Ethernet port. I have tested all of these, and they all work great. The Blu-Ray reader/burner is amazing, and all Dvd's are automatically made HD, which is a great feature.Track pad: The track pad is just about as big as a Macbook's, and has some gestures too. Asus is catching up to Apple, but Apple is still in the lead in the track pad department. The two keys (left and right click)aren't so hot. You have to click the very far left on the left-click, which is a bit annoying.CPU: The CPU is FAST - clocking in at 2.2 Ghz. It has quad-core processing, which is very helpful for those who need to run many programs at once. I haven't completely taxed it yet, and I don't plan too. Needless to say, it can handle all programs with ease.GPU: The Nvidia GPU (Nvidia GT 555m) runs everything fluently. So far, I have tried Team Fortress 2, DOTA 2, Uberstrike, and Borderlands 2. Here is a list of FPS for those of you who game.TF2 - High: 40-60 FPS Normal: 60-100 FPS Low: 100-150 FPSDOTA 2 - High: 75-90 FPS Normal: 80-100 FPS Low: 100-150 FPSUberstrike - High: 60-80 FPS, depending on maps Normal: Same as high Low: 80-150 FPSBL2 - High: 40-50 FPS Normal: 50-70 Low: 60-80If you are into gaming, such as running Steam, I HIGHLY recommend this computer.RAM: 8GB of RAM is more than enough to run even the most graphic-intensive or CPU demanding programs. Expandable to 16GB on this PC.Hard Drive: 1 TB is big, more than enough for me. It is partitioned into four drives, each has 250 GB. The hard drives are all spinning at 7200 RPM, which is fast, not as fast as the VelociRaptor, which is 10000 RPM, but still very fast. Again, more than enough room.Keyboard: The keyboard is a bit clacky, although I'm still getting used to it. I keep hitting caps lock when reaching for \"A\", but that's a minor detail. The volume buttons on the side are very helpful, I use them all the time. All in all, it's not bad. NOTE: Sadly, this keyboard is NOT BACKLIT. Take that into consideration if you live in a cave ;).Sound: WOW. Asus lives up to their standards. The free sub woofer is amazing, I use it when I'm gaming and watching movies. Bang & Olufsen ICEpower speakers are very nice, and the huge speaker bar at the front of the computer is a great touch.Bloatware: This computer (thankfully) doesn't come with too much bloatware. Most of it is very helpful, such as Nvidia Optimus technology, and other helpful programs.Problems so far: None. Of course, I had to wait a while for it to boot up, since there were 92 updates, but it's hasn't stuttered since.Overall: An amazing buy. I got my for $950, NIB, and it is amazing. Definitely a keeper.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS N75S", "Author": "BigZ", "ReviewID": "R201KUX9BJ0X84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow when I bought this laptop, I didnt think so that it so good.
