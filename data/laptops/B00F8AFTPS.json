Just Terrible.", "Author": "Bri", "ReviewID": "R9Z7KU2K2DK94", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Got this for Christmas and was very excited about it. Had difficulty connecting to the internet, computer showed the router was bad even though our other laptop was connected to wifi just fine, as well as our phones and xbox. Every time I restarted the laptop I would have to reconnect to wifi. Finally wifi stopped working altogether and when it finally connected to my network it showed limited access. When I troubleshot the problem it showed nothing to be wrong. I will be returning this first chance I get for a laptop that will actually work. Very disappointed with this poor quality system. I will not be purchasing another Sony computer thanks to this fiasco. Don't waste your time or money.", "Date": "December 24, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00F8AFTPS"}}
