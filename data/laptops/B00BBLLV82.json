Norris", "ReviewID": "R2XOIJCR3LQ9RO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop is not a powerhouse, nor was it designed to be. The default installation of Windows 8 (later upgraded to 8.1) is horrible, with all of the associated cr*pware bloat that is installed by default. Performing a fresh installation of Windows 7 (allowed by the Windows 8 license) completely changed my mind on this system - by far more stable and easier to use!(With Windows 7): Boots relatively fast, stable networking and average hard disk speed, it get's the job done when heavy lifting is not required. You're not going to produce a full-length feature film on it by any means, but it gets the job more than done for most tasks. It is confusing to see the people complaining about it not being an Intel i7 64gb RAM SSD powerhouse but that's not what it was meant to be in the first place - get an AlienWare laptop for serious gaming or heavy use!This is a Basic Laptop with an excellent screen, chicklet-style keyboard (with full numeric pad on the side, a big +) and will serve it's purpose as a mobile workstation or streaming video laptop. With Win 7 I would rate it as perfectly acceptable for a moderate user or a college student, plus the price is right.Only downsides I can see for this price point is the somewhat plasticky feel of the case (some sharp edges around the screen) and the lack of a Hard Disk Drive activity indicator, other than that, serves it's role perfectly in my daily use.", "Date": "January 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "OK for simple use and tasks", "Author": "Diane", "ReviewID": "RMGVOUBAV5WCJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Truthfully, I wanted a cheap way to try out Windows 8 without putting it on my main computer.  I also wanted something to use in the family room for Internet based activities and email.  The computer is OK for that.  It is no speed demon, but I knew that going in.  The buttons on the keyboard seem crucial to any navigation, which seems a step back, but that could just be me.  I am truly glad that I had a chance to try out Windows 8 because I will now go out of my way to avoid it at all costs on all my other  computers.  I find that I go back to my android tablets quickly after using this computer to answer email (keyboard is bigger).  So if I need to use this computer for anything other than very light use, I will switch it out to Linux or any other OS, or maybe a cheap copy of Windows 7.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't buy if you want to do simple things like internet browsing", "Author": "Brittany", "ReviewID": "R2H3513DVULWYN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This laptop is very, very slow. Some times the computer will register that you typed something and some times it won't. If you want to do simple internet browsing on one window (forget having multiple up!) then you are looking at the wrong computer. If you click on a Windows 8 app, then likely you will have to repeat the process three times for the computer to go into the app. The app store is useless because the computer won't let you login. The USB 3 ports read as if they were original USB ports - slow.I ran a malware program right out of the box and found that there wasn't any. I reinstalled Windows 8, then Windows 8.1 and nothing sped up the computer at all. It's simply put - a piece of crap. The price is astronomically priced for what the capabilities are. I literally could do nothing but stare at the computer for the days that I had it. I had IT play with it as well and came up with no other alternatives except to return it.If you really can't afford much for a laptop, get something on Ebay or a refurbished machine for 50% to 75% less than this computer in your community.", "Date": "December 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fine", "Author": "adn", "ReviewID": "R1Z96THU72JBZE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very please with the producct really what you expec, but the box too big they could a fin box that fit the actual size of it", "Date": "January 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very low quality", "Author": "Joshua Pennell", "ReviewID": "R26BL3LU6AZFLB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We bought this for an employee to use as a burn computer.
