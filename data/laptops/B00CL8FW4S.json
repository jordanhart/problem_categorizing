Another thing is this it not your traditional ultrabook, you can consider it a hybrid as it comes with both a HDD and a SSD.SoftwareOkay if there's one hangup with this laptop it would be Windows 8. Cannot not stress how horrible it is. I ended up changing to Windows 7 and I also dual boot it with Ubuntu and it still runs amazing.HardwareNot the lightest laptop but not the heaviest. I can handle & carry it in one hand.Keyboard is nice, smooth, and backlit which is very convenient.The trackpad could definitely be better. Takes some getting used to, but most of the times I use a mouse instead.Another quirk is the power button could be placed in a better spot.Really great hybrid \"ultrabook\" for the money if you don't want to shell out a grand+. This is the second Acer that I've purchased.I'm thrilled with it.", "Date": "August 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sleek, Sexy, & Fast!", "Author": "Scott Nelms", "ReviewID": "R385SYSLUYTZIH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I5 w/ 6g memory, a 500gb HD, and a 20gb Solid state drive for speed, Dolby digital app for home connection through HDMI works great and sound adjustments are separate.  Is by far the best looking with the metal body and nice hinges.  The keyboard lights up and is great in the dark. I returned four before this and this one became a keeper immediately.  The display screen is very, very thin with hardly any lip on it. Looks great.", "Date": "May 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would be nice if it worked....", "Author": "M. Schmidt \"fallen dust\"", "ReviewID": "RST752UJ945NL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Really wanted to get a another desktop, but my better half wanted a laptop. My 12 year old desktop still works great, just wanted something newer. We shopped around for awhile, and this had everything we wanted. Didn't really need it for anything to complicated, just internet, office, and xbmc for watching movies (It has an hdmi output which we had connected to our receiver).Took me a long time to get used to windows 8, but I was slowly coming around.After about a month, it started freezing about 3-4 times a week. Couldn't do anything except a hard reset with the power button. Tried just about everything, got rid of xbmc, got rid of acer apps, photos, everything. Finally decided to just reset the system from scratch. And, you guessed it, froze during that too.Just when I was going to send it in, it re-started, I put in all of my information again, started it up. Great. Went online to check my email.....and it froze again.Currently being sent back to Acer. If it comes back fixed without freezing, I will update and give back a star or two. But when my desktop I bought 12 years ago froze once (when the hard drive went after 8 years) and is still working great, I expected a little better than one month out of a brand new laptop. I am currently using that 12 year old computer to write this review. And its not freezing. After searching google and seeing the number of others with similar issues with Acer computers, I would never buy another one.

I had the one year Acer warranty and called them to get help, but they argued that the issue was due to a windows 8 software problem and could not help me. They wanted to charge me money to send a recovery CD to fix the issue.  Furthermore, they couldn't help me with recovering files.  Acer, if you're going to give warranties to your customers, don't say it's not your fault that a computer breaks after a month.
