I previously owned a 13\" white Macbook, and the difference is remarkable. I would say that this is a wonderful computer for students of the humanities, who do a lot of writing, research, and require a computer for entertainment purposes.SPEEDI actually haven't seen any speed difference, but for what I use my computer for (writing and research), I wasn't expecting much. I do get significantly less \"spinning beach ball of death\" though. It is comparable to my older, C2D iMac for most tasks. Even running on only 2GB of RAM, I don't find any slowdowns or lockups, even when swapping between Word and several large PDFs.STORAGE128GB is not quite enough to hold up to my entire media collection, but I have an iMac for that. I use the cloud options through various other groups (in particular Google Music, Spotify, and Netflix) for my media consumption on the go. For others, this might not be acceptable, but the option exists for more storage; external HDDs are plentiful, as are 16/32GB SD cards.BATTERYI frequently get a full 7 hours out of my battery, screen halfway up, taking notes in class (including recording audio), wifi on. With wifi off that jumps a bit, and even more so if I turn the screen brightness down at night.DURABILITYThis is part of the reason I think this is a wonderful computer for students. When I was moving in January, my computer took a 4' drop from someone's arms onto pavement -- nothing but a VERY small dent, and thanks to the Solid State Drive, nothing else was damaged. I actually have to look specifically to even find the dent that was made, it's so barely noticeable.OSX LIONOther people don't like Mission Control, but I find it easier to use than Spaces, and get a lot more use out of it than I ever did Spaces. I tended not to be willing to screw about with the settings for Spaces, because adding applications to a particular space was a bit too nitpicky for me. It's much easier to do in the new version, and I think students will find it particularly useful. I keep four desktops: internet, music, writing, and schoolwork.Features such as natural scrolling and the trackpad gestures I turned off, because I find them less than useful. I don't see a point in moaning about them -- as long as the option to remove them remains intact, I don't mind.", "Date": "September 17, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best writer's laptop evar(sp)!", "Author": "nomadhacker", "ReviewID": "RULB4Q41819ZX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It has been quite a while since I've developed an attachment to a laptop like I have to this one.  At least ten years since I've seen a laptop or any computer as anything more than a tool, just as I would a hammer.But the new MacBook Air, with it's tiny chassis basically begs to tag along wherever you go.The keyboard is the same great Apple chicklet style as on their other portable line, which is one of the best keyboards (alongside the thinkpad) on any portable device out there.  It's springy and responsive and gives good feedback.  The screen is basically the best in a device of it's size.  (I'll admit, I was unsure about whether the high resolution screen would be too tiny for comfortable use, but it's clarity and crispness make it actually easier to read things on than my old HP 16\" with a lower screen resolution.Also, as many many reviews out there have already pointed out, but which I didn't personally believe until I started using it myself, don't worry about speed.  The clock speed ratings, which everyone including myself have been conditioned to pay way too much attention to over the years, are extremely misleading.  The SSD storage in this thing makes more of a difference than i had believed possible.  In short, this thing is darned snappy, even feels faster than my desktop with a higher clock speed.The battery life is excellent, and For writing and even web browsing, it regularly outlasts its stated 7 hours of usage on a charge.The only real downside to this laptop, as a portable writing/coding machine, is that now I'm going to need to get one for my wife.  She has her eye on the 11\" one.", "Date": "March 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Switching from PC: Asus UL30VT", "Author": "Y. Zhou", "ReviewID": "RYECSMKFXRX75", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi thereBefore I start my review, let me tell you a bit of my background. I am a college student majoring in computer science. I am passionate about computers. My last laptop was an Asus UL30VT, which I loved. I am almost always on a computer. I play games, program, media, etc.In general, I like this macbook air. I bought this MBA a day after the 2011 macbook pros came out (I bought mine used for $950). I bought it in hopes that it will scratch my itch for a tablet, and it worked. I'm not going to do a full review of the major component of the MBA, as my review is months late, I will do a review of the little things that other reviews missed.Compared to the UL30VT:I'm pretty sure the UL30VT is about the closest comparison PC laptop to the macbook air 13\". They both have outstanding battery life, similar Low Voltage processors, no dvd drive, etc. I chose to buy this macbook air because it is slimmer, lighter, better design and trackpad, and I always wanted to try Mac OS. Trackpad is best in the world in my opinion. Keyboard is ok, but seems flimsy.PC vs Mac:Mac is obviously a lot more smoother. For example, when on Google, my UL30VT laptop was always very glitch when it came to 2-finger scrolling. Because the typing cursor was in the google search bar, i can never leave the top of the page using 2 finger scrolling, it would always jump back. Nothing like that on the Mac. Everything just seems smoother. HOWEVER, there are other softwares that run better on PC. For example, Python 2.7 (a programming software) often crashes on me on Mac (yes I downloaded the Mac version). A lot of older games (including my favorite Tribes 2), cannot run on the Mac. I have yet to run Windows on my macbook yet.Macbook Air Myths Busted:1) Macs DO crash (not macbook air specific). It's a bit different than windows. When a Mac program crashes, it is secluded to itself. For example, if my Python program crashes, it just stops responding (Mac will not give you a warning). However, every other program you opened still operates 100%. As of yet, only my OS did not crash completely.2) Macbook Air DOES get hot. A lot of reviews online said the macbook air is cool to the touch. that's only partially right. The air will get hot when you use the computer for extended hours, and when you watch videos (especially with flash). Right now, I have used the air for about 4 hours using web-surfing and instant messaging, and the top half of the computer where the keyboard is located is warm. Apple did a great job secluding the warmth to the upper half and the underside of the macbook, keeping the palm rests as cool as possible.Battery Life:Apple listed 7 hours of battery life. You can generally get 8-10 hours if you do light web browsing (especially with safari as it is built by apple). However, make sure you disable Flash. Simply go to preferences, and uncheck the box \"Enable Web Plugins\". There are also other apps that you can install to control Flash content. If you use it to view youtube, you will probably get around 3-4 hours.Design:MBA is obviously the sleekest looking laptop in the market. However, it does not feel light. Holding it with one hand standing up is tiring. But still, 10/10Instant on feature:The MBA does come on instantly, however, if you leave it sleeping for a long while, \"instant on\" takes a bit longer, like 3-4 seconds! UNACCEPTABLE. lol. but honestly, still works like a charm.What I don't like about the instant on feature is that I am used to my laptop turning off the screen when I close the screen, not going to sleep. It automatically disconnects from WIFI, and anything you're doing will be stopped, such as downloading or chatting. Furthermore, if you leave your MBA on for too long, it goes to sleep by itself, even if you are still downloading something. There is probably something in the system preferences you can change to avoid that, but I downloaded a Mac App that when turned on, the Mac system is not allowed to go to sleep.Sometimes, when the MBA either were left on for too long without closing the lid, or when it runs out of battery, it will not turn on even after charging the battery. Pressing keys and the power button will do nothing. The only fix I found was to hold the power button down for a while to shut the system down, and then power it back up.Overall:very pleased. 9.999/10. Missing backlit keyboard :). I do respond to questions so ask away.UPDATE:Yesterday, I used my MBA throughout the day, and left it on overnight to download large contents, and in the morning, it was acting up where youtube was very jumpy with no sounds. I had to restart my MBA to re-enable the sounds and video content to run smoothly.UPDATE:To prevent the MBA from sleeping when closing the lid, you have to download InsomniaX. No option for this in system preferences.", "Date": "March 2, 2011"}, {"Title": "suits my needs just fine", "Author": "mrknowitall \"mrknowitall\"", "ReviewID": "RK85GAY9IPIY0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this puppy on a whim because an attempt to share the G5 laptop with my wife was causing some schoolyard friction.  Keep in mind that as a retired geezer my primary use for a laptop is almost entirely limited to the net, mail, photos and a occasional movie.  I edit my superb videos on a desktop.Pleasant surprises -- 1)  One second after raising the screen it's ready to go.  2)  At my level of usage the bottom gets just ever-so-slightly warm.  Hence, I'm able to assume my comfy slouch position on the sofa, put this bad boy on top of a pillow on my lap without the fear of cooking it's innards.  No more hot thighs and cooling fan noise. For me, that alone is worth the price.  But again, I never press this thing anywhere near to it's designed potential.  3) The super-slippery finger pad is neat.  4)  Even with my sub-par hearing the speakers are more than I can use - amazing with such a thin profile.Unpleasant surprises --- 1)  The place at the front edge where one rests the heel of one's hand is like a dull knife pressing on you.  After 15 minutes or so you're obliged to place a rag there to stop the pain.  I fixed that problem by cutting two strips of foam that came in the box, gluing them together and then gluing that to the knife edge .... problem solved.  2)  The finger pad is waaaaay too sensitive.  Forget about lightly resting your finger on that pad!  If you do, you will activate something.  If you have the cursor stopped on whatever for a few seconds -even without tapping- it triggers whatever it's resting on. What a huge nuisance!  I would most definitely prefer a thumb clicker rather than tapping the slippery finger pad.  It drives me nuts.  3)  I don't like the tweaking they've done to Mail and iPhoto.  Can't they ever learn to just leave alone something that works well as is?  4) Apple wants $100 to transfer data ..... get the separate drive.  Finally, if you're considering this computer for movie editing you better have a camera that uses a SD card.  There is NO POSSIBLE WAY to transfer raw mini-tape video into the Air's iMovie 'll via a firewire cable.  For me the smaller screen is not worth considering. Yes, it's overpriced.  It's very light.  It's super fast.  It runs with no heat.  Just de-sensitize that finger pad!", "Date": "March 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "very good, but not great (air vs pro)", "Author": "Dan InGold \"xz38\"", "ReviewID": "R18ODRMPA8M7J4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This boy has a great performance and portability combination, state of art design and very high build quality (2 USB prots, 1 SD card slot, 1 Mini display port). It seems to me it is even faster than low-end Macbook Pro 13\" 2010. This should be resulted from the on-board flash storage.  If this one has an equivalent display experience as the 13\" macbook pro, I would recommend everyone go get this one.My major complain:is from the display. First of all, the display is good (1440X900 high resolution, close to matte finish(no reflection)). However when you put it besides Macbook pro 13\" 2010 model. You will see the big difference on playing the same video and showing the same web page and photos. The color appears washed-out for MBA. You will see color less saturated and yellowish.You may have an impression that the display won't last long.  Some people mentioned it has less 25% gamut space than the pro.  Try to play Shrek 4 at the same time using both MBA and MBP, you will see the difference.My minor complain:is from that there is no backlight for the keyboard.Conclusion:If you are serious with using it for photo and video work, I would recommend you go for macbook pro (but keep in mind it is 1.6lb heavier). Otherwise,  you should just go get MBA. Is it worthy upgrading 4GB ram? For regular usage, I think 2GB is plenty. From my comparison with Macpro on Microsoft office application, MBA performed better than Macbook Pro 13\". That being said, if portability is your primary concern and you hava a good external display, you should go for MBA over MBP.Update (03-08-2011):There is a drawback on display for macbook pro 2011 model. In this case, I would recommend MBA 13\" over MBP 13\".", "Date": "February 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect So Far", "Author": "H. Kremer \"hkremer\"", "ReviewID": "R15XPPI406Y7FA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had just about every Apple computer since 1990. I am most impressed with this one because it does what it's supposed to do so well, and in so little space with so little heft. I've become accustomed to the \"personal\" computing experience with my iPad, but have been a little frustrated with the text input. Writing this review would have been a bit of a pain on the iPad. I use the Air for different types of things than the iPad, but it still feels personal. The relatively new 15\" MacBook Pro that had been using was too heavy and big. My windows never covered the full screen anyway. When I did need to do big-monitor work with it, it was hooked up to a large monitor. I can do that with this Air too.The keyboard has just the right feel for me. I LOVE that there is no optical drive. What's the point with those any more? Installing software? Just share another machine's optical drive for the few applications that still come on CD or DVD (MS Office, and, um...). Videos? We have iTunes, Amazon, Netflix, etc. for that. The solid state drive makes it feel very zippy. After some deliberation I decided to get the stock 2G RAM. For what I do (now), it's been plenty. And the 128G HD is more than enough now that most things I do are cloud-based, e.g. Pandora, rather than loading up 50G of music, e.g. iTunes (Apple really, really, should move to the cloud with music). Oh, and buy DropBox while you're at it so you can do cloud storage correctly :-)I think I'm a pretty critical tech consumer, but I haven't found a single fault with this thing. I love it.", "Date": "March 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Wonderful, but it does make some sacrifices.", "Author": "Jon R", "ReviewID": "RTNJ0C6B6AK1J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'd almost give this laptop 5 stars but it makes some (some of which are unneeded) sacrifices to be thin and still affordable. I gave it a rating I think it deserves after spending time with it. Based on the needs of a student, who has a desktop at home for more intense things. I think this is a great laptop for someone who has a desktop already, it's probably not a good idea to use as your only computer. But Apple product reviews attract so many blind fanboys and haters that I'm going to try to give an unbiased review. You really have to ask yourself, are the sacrifices Apple made worth the portability.First what it does have.- The thinnest and lightest 13\" laptop you'll find. Period.- Silent operation. I don't mean extremely quiet I mean silent. The only time I hear a soft fan noise was when I really stressed it out.- Nice bright screen with an excellent picture.- Instant on from sleep, and boots up from \"off\" in seconds.- Decent battery life. Lasts weeks in sleep and 7-8 hours of use.-The Magsafe charger. Something found on all modern Macbooks. I am a fan of this since it won't break or pull the laptop down if you trip on it.- OS X, what can I say once you try OS X you'll only use Windows for Windows exclusive programs and games. Check out the OS X reviews, or better yet go into an Apple store and see it for yourself. Also worth noting is upgrades are a LOT cheaper than a Windows upgrade.- Surprisingly good sound, given the fact that you cant even see the speakers. They won't blow you away (especially if you're an audiophile) but they match my Windows laptop, and that's good enough for a laptop.- The same camera found on the iPhone, which you can use for Facetime or other video chatting.- The USB ports are high powered, meaning they can charge tablets (unlike standard ports that don't provide enough juice), and most importantly they can run external drives that require two USB port from only one port.- SSD storage. SSD is fast enough that it makes up for any lack of speed the processor may have. It's the reason for t- Decent GPU. I was actually expecting to see a crappy Intel GPU in this, instead you have the best on board graphics out. It's not going to hod a candle to dedicated solutions, but if you expected that on an utltra portable you were kidding yourself.What it's missing- Ports. It has two USB ports, one SD slot, and one Mini Display Port (which is useless without an adator unless you have an Apple monitor). Considering it's lack of a DVD drive and storage space, you may find yourself using one or both of those on storage alone.- No CD/DVD. When traveling I can live without this, but everything is not yet digital. There are times when one needs a CD/DVD drive.- Storage. To save space and increase speed Apple used an SSD chip (similar to the iPad). Unfortunatly, while fast this means it cannot be upgraded. If you want more space you'll have to buy an external drive- Outdated CPU. I find it sad that Apple went with a CPU that will be outdated before you even get your laptop home. This thing with a modern i5 would have been a beast. Supposidly it has to do with the i5 not mixing with the nVidia GPU, but I don't know that I buy that. That said, the effecian OS X and super fast SSD mean the laptops performance can still match many i5 Windows laptops.So there you have it.  Hope this helps you make a decision not based on people who think Apple deserves their worshipping or those who think it should burn just for attracting such people.", "Date": "January 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "I love My macbook air", "Author": "C.

Do it!", "Author": "Clan Gardner \"Gregor\"", "ReviewID": "R3ETVG7BQHYQA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're considering switching to a Mac, I'd like to share my experience and its happy ending. Others have sufficiently reviewed and critiqued the Macbook Air from a technical point of view... so I won't reiterate that. Instead I'll briefly recount the thought process and experience of one guy making the transition.I debated for a long time about whether to make the switch from my Windows based laptop to the Mac platform... I had bought my wife a Mac Mini two years ago and she has actually felt so-so about it. Her Mac is far more stable than her previous PC, which she appreciates. But--she feels--her Mac is not as amazing and \"intuitive\" as it was cracked up to be. We have discovered in the meanwhile that there is some truth to the idea that some people's brains just seem to resonate more with one system or the other. In many ways, she is more of a \"Windows gal,\" as she puts it. Nonetheless, she has been very happy to have a system that is so stable and does not crash or freeze. And in most other respects, she has been satisfied.So given her sufficiently positive experience, it made sense to seriously consider the idea of getting our entire household all on the same platform rather than having to duplicate software and OS upgrades moving forward.Furthermore, I was increasingly having several issues with my laptop: slow-ish; prone to daily freezes or crashes; weird, buggy quirks that I could never seem to eliminate. Finally, being a (very) frequent business traveler, the weight of it (about 6-7 pounds, with the power supply), was a big drag. So given all these considerations, it was a natural to consider the switch.So why didn't I make the leap right away???My hesitation stemmed from several sources. 1st, I'd spent a chunk of money just a few years back on my laptop and its docking station--so the \"Scotsman\" in me was not too keen to switch to a new machine before thoroughly \"amortizing\" my previous investment, i.e. getting my full money's worth out of it! 2nd, the thought of having to transfer files, re-load software, re-establish internet and email settings, etc. etc. made me nauseous to even think about it... Finally, there would be some things on my Windows laptop that I wouldn't be able to use on my new Macbook Air (like receipt scanner software that goes with my Windows-based travel scanner... or my MS Flight simulator and joystick).In sum, making the leap entailed some significant costs, monetary and otherwise.Ultimately, after thinking through all the pros and cons, it boiled down to: (a) erase my laptop and reinstall XP (or purchase Windows 7) plus all other software to get all the performance issues resolved or (b) bite the bullet, pay the bucks, and make the switch.In the end, the idea of running two platforms in one house just didn't make sense... and longer-term, it seemed like a fruitless struggle to keep myself chained to an inferior system... And, amidst that joyless scenario, I kept hearing fantastic kudos from friends and colleagues about the Macbook Air (MBA) and othe Macs... making it very alluring, indeed...I did briefly consider the Macbook Pros... but I didn't really need any extra processing power that that decision might entail... and being a road warrior clinched it. The light weight, instant turn-on and turn-off of the MBA (plus the fact that I use fairly basic functions, like internet, email, Office, iPhoto, etc.) made me opt for the Macbook Air (MBA), which I purchased in July 2011.I was, of course, chagrined to have them come out with the NEXT model just a month later... but the differences are fairly negligible, given my usage.I did buy an external disk drive for the very occasional time when I might need it. In 2 months, I've only needed it 1 time, thus far. So not having to schlepp that embedded weight around is actually a huge plus. Similarly having \"only\" 2 USB ports has proven to be a non-issue. I have to switch out some cords now and again, but it is no big deal compared to the extra weight and clunkiness more ports would entail.The transition from PC to Mac has been far easier than I anticipated all in all... and though not everything about the way a Mac functions is better or more efficient than Windows (sometimes there are some surprising, but minor, quirks and deficiencies), overall, I do indeed find the Mac experience, stability, and the fabled \"intuitiveness\" to be a joy. I just love this computer and it was worth every penny. I've never said that about any previous computer I've owned. And as light as it is, I actually use it around home just like an iPad... yet can do serious work on it.So, if you're at all similar to me (50; long-time PC user; critical; appreciative of systems and equipment which work effectively and aesthetically; fairly basic computer user (though Mac is known for workingwonderfully for far more sophisticated functions than I need)... then life is too short not to make the switch.
