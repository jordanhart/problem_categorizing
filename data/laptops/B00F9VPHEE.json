I did a significant amount of shopping, both online and in brick and mortar stores and could not find as good a laptop at this price. the processor speed and RAM are enough for me to run AutoCAD and anything else I want at the same time with no issues. This processor should keep me in business for several years before needing more power.This is my first Win 8 machine and I was pleased to find it came with Windows 8.1 installed. I installed Classic Shell (freeware) that makes it feel more like Win 7 with a start button and now it's just like I'm used to (almost).You can find the full specs online so I won't repeat them all here but I'll state what I like, what I'm still undecided about and what I wish were done better:Likes:The processor and RAM - FAST 4th Gen i7 quad core and 8GBThe speakers/sound system is awesomeBacklit keyboard and the keys have a good solid feel to them.It's easy to turn the back lighting on the keys on & off.There's an actual button to turn off the touchpad while typing - I hate palm detection; it never works for meThe laptop is thin and light - not quite what I'd call an Ultrabook, but close.Construction feels solid, even if it's not a metal case (see undecided).I still like having a DVD drive even though I rarely use it.VGA and HDMI video outputs for near universal monitor/projector connections.SD card reader and 3 total USB ports. I have not tried the sleep and charge on the USB 2.0 port.Undecided:The case and exterior are plastic (metalized plastic for the lid) - It seems to be pretty durable but time will tell. My last 3 laptops have all been plastic and it's been fine so I shouldn't be so picky I guess.The screen is glossy and I'm used to a matte screen - still getting used to thisBattery life seems decent but have not tried this out too much yet.Could be better:Wish it had a 1080 HD+ display, but the 720 HD it has is standard in 15.6\" laptops. It costs a lot more to get a 1080 HD Laptop so I can live with it.Lots of junk software comes pre-installed, but you can't avoid that unless you build your own.The battery is not removable - seems to be the way the thinner laptops are going but I'd still like to be able to just unplug it if it dies.Overall I'm very happy I got it.(Edit 2/12/14) 2 months after getting this laptop I'm still very happy that I got it.  It has proven to be very stable (I've never had it crash on me - knock on wood)and it runs anything I throw at it with no issues. Sound system is far better on this laptop than any others I've had prior.  Great laptop, great price!", "Date": "December 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would be a fantastic laptop if it didn't come with Windows 8", "Author": "Steve K", "ReviewID": "R114T8XE61GWL7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The machine is great! Very powerful & quick at every command..However, it also comes with Windows 8. I had heard the horror stories about how bad 8 is (a quick google search will show you what I mean) and just figured everybody was blowing it out of proportion. They were not. It's probably a solid system for a tablet but that's about it, the metro layout is absolute garbage on a non-touch screen computer. You have to pull and flick windows from/to corners to navigate the screen, which is very counter intuitive for any person who has used PCs in the past. If you download Microsoft's \"We're sorry\" Windows 8.1 update, you get a start button like past Windows setups....only it brings you back to the tiles when you click it. Right clicking does bring up actual useful options (Shut down/Task Manager/My Computer etc), but that takes some getting used to.Had I known Windows 8 was actually as bad as people had said, I would have gone the extra steps to get a system without it. You can not use your copys of Windows 7 to throw in and have it replace 8, they block that. Instead you can either pay a local PC repair shop to erase Windows 8 from the machine in favor for Windows 7, pay the $100 to Microsoft to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro and use the downgrade rights to get Windows 7 back at your finger tips. Or...just suck it up and deal with the worst PC layout to date.Trying to use such a nice machine with Windows 8 is like trying to run with your hands tied behind your back.", "Date": "November 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "not bad if you get it under 700.", "Author": "R.

Toshiba tech support sucks and even on a new computer they want $$$ to help.  it's a fast computer. recpectable amount of memory and disk space. very light. repels  fingerprints.  wish it had the option to downgrade to windows 7.", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Meets my needs.", "Author": "JoJo", "ReviewID": "R3AT60HZ5VG0UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Receiving a new computer at work with an i7 processor convinced me to upgrade my own i3 laptop. With this laptop, the start-ups and shutdowns are significantly quicker. Going from 4GB to 8GB of RAM improved my web browsing speed. (It's noticeable because I only have standard DSL.) The number one reason I purchased this laptop is because of the increase in processing speed.Not crazy about Windows 8, so I downloaded \"Classic Shell\" for the classic Windows look. I'm not holding Windows 8 against Toshiba because that operating system comes standard with virtually every new PC.At first I was disappointed with the appearance of the graphics/display. It looked slightly washed-out compared to my older laptop. I rectified it by making adjustments with the Intel HD Graphics (Display) located in the Control Panel.The back-lit keys are awesome. The back lights are not permanently lit up. It comes on the instant you push any key, then turns off after so many seconds of inactivity. In general, the keys have a very nice feel.When I compare this to the 4 other laptops I have owned in the past: it's the fastest, the thinnest, the quietest, and stays the coolest. Also like the sleek silver look.The only downer for me is that the battery is not user-replaceable. My touchpad didn't seem to work too well, but it's moot as I prefer to use a mouse. (I disable the touchpad). Would prefer the AC connector to be on the right side instead of the left, but no biggie.So far (2 weeks), I am very please with this purchase.

It came with Windows 8 as the default operating system. Following general consensus, I immediately upgraded to Windows 8.1. A few weeks later, my computer began lagging then completely crashing. Suspecting a virus, I enlisted the help of Norton Antivirus: no help. Several tech-savvy friends also had no solutions. Neither Best Buy nor Staples were able to find a problem either. The crashing happened more frequently, several times an hour. (By \"crash\" I mean it would freeze up with 100% CPU usage, not respond to any user input for at least 20 minutes, and often power itself down, or I would turn it off manually.) No error reports were ever generated. My workaround was to completely reset the operating system, and NOT upgrade to Windows 8.1. Three months later, my computer has yet to crash, thankfully. This shows me that Windows 8.1 is not compatible with this computer, and/or this computer is not capable of running contemporary software.On the hardware itself: The keyboard is comfortable to type with, and I like the placement of the arrow keys and the 10-key. However, after only 6 months of student use (mostly internet research, limited typing), several keys have already broken. Specifically, my screen-brighten button causes the computer to go into sleep mode, the dimmer button does nothing, and more recently the volume up and volume down buttons have stopped working. The computer only came with a 3 month warranty, and thus any and all repairs will be on my own dime. Replacing a keyboard is not complicated, but the fact that it is becoming necessary after 6 months causes me to lose faith in the quality of Toshiba's manufacturing. Finally, my touchpad has started tracking my fingers incorrectly, causing webpages and the mouse to jump erratically at times.I will not be buying a Toshiba again.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "He didn't send the laptop that I bought", "Author": "Pablo", "ReviewID": "RR52GTEPZ14T7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm very sad and angry with this seller.

Remember, this is billed as a NEW unit with a Backlit Keyboard.  There is even a sticker to the right of the touchpad advertising the backlit keyboard feature.What I received did not look factory new and not even Toshiba Support could make the backlit keyboard work.  Immediately when I unpacked it, I noticed a small scratch on the display.  I could have lived with a minor scratch on the back or bottom, even though a new machine should be scratch-free, but a scratched display is unacceptable.  The \"backlit keyboard\" didn't work right out of the box.  In fact, it never did light up, even after a call to Toshiba support and an hour of my life I'll never get back.  This unit is not what I would call 100% NEW.  When I called Toshiba support, they told me it was a good thing I called when I did, as this unit only had 5 days of free support left from Toshiba.  Their records show it as being sold around the first of this year (This is April).  I understand things sit on the shelves sometimes before they are sold, but I don't think it's unrealistic to expect to be able to get support for a new laptop for longer than 5 days after you receive it.  And I paid for 2-day shipping to boot!The unit itself was rather sluggish and, for lack of a better word, \"doggy\" in operation.  The touchpad takes some getting used to, especially the \"push hard with one finger to left-click and push hard with two fingers to right-click\" part.  My old Dell Latitude D620 with 4GB of RAM, an ancient processor, and a cheap solid state drive is snappier than this unit was.  Do yourself a favor and buy something else.
