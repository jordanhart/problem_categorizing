{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Best Windows Laptop and Only Competitor to the Apple MacBook Pro Retina 15\"", "Author": "AK529", "ReviewID": "RQEX0WXU7EVS1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ive owned this laptop for a little over a month now and I am very happy with it. In terms of specs this is currently the best windows laptop and only competitior to Apple MacBook Pro 15 inch. This laptop is about $300 cheaper than the MacBook Pro 15inch. The resolution is higher than the one on the MacBook Pro. This laptop also has more USB ports than the MacBook Pro. The weight is identical to the MacBook Pro at 4.4 pounds. In terms of battery life I get about 7 hours with light browsing and the brightness on the second lowest settings. The MacBook Pro does get more battery life at 9 hours and the MacBook Pro ssd drive is pci based which makes it faster than this dell laptop. Personally I have a lot software, games and accessories invested with windows, so none of these would work with the MacBook Pro unless i installed windows on it. The keyboard and trackpad are very easy to type on. The speakers do a decent job for listening to music, watching videos or playing games. The screen is pretty glossy but is also a touch screen which the MacBook Pro doesnt offer. I use the laptop most time hooked up to my 32 inch 1080p tv using it as a monitor and also use wireless mouse and keyboard. This laptop has plenty of ram at 16gb and a large 512gb ssd. The graphics card is also identical to the one on the MacBook Pro (nvidia geforce 750m), which is midrange graghics card. Wifi is really fast with the integrated ac wireless card. Overall I am very satisfied with this laptop. Theres only a few things I dont like or would like to change with this laptop. I wish all 4 USB ports were 3.0 instead of 3 of them being 3.0 and one being 2.0. Also I wish the battery was removable and lasted closer to 9 hours. I also wish the laptop had a integrated Ethernet port so I wouldnt have to buy the dongle from dell for $30. I purchased my laptop from costco so also got a 2 year warranty and 90 day returns. In addition because of the delay in my order dell gave me a credit of $225. This laptop is expensive but is the only laptop on the moment with all best specs.Update after 6 weeks of ownership: Still very happy with my purchase. Just wanted to add a few things to my review that I may have missed. The screen is very bright and has good viewing angles. I dont use the screen at the default resolution of 3200 x 1800. Most things look really small and hard to read. Ive set the resolution to 1080p. It still looks great and is compatible with everything in windows. Boot up time is about 10 seconds when the computer is completely turned off. Waking up from sleep is almost instantaneous. The laptop only gets warm and on the hot side when gaming (civilization 5:brave new world) after long periods of time. Same with the fan and the noise of it. The laptop is built very well with aluminium and carbon fiber. I really like the dedicated function keys which are similar to the macbook pro also. Dedicated function keys allow you to quickly mute, volume up, volume down, previous track, play/pause, next track, switch displays, search, adjust brightness of backlit on keyboard, lower screen brightness, increase screen brightness and toggle air plane mode. All these can be accessed by pressing the button once, there is no need to press the function key before or at the same time. One other advantage this laptop has over the Macbook pro retina 15\" is that most of the parts are replaceable or upgradable. The ram, hard drive, battery, etc all can easily replaced or upgraded once the back cover is replaced. With the  macbook pro these parts are soldered onto the mother board which makes it very hard to replace its parts.  This laptop doesn't have an optical drive and the also keyboard doesnt have a numerical keypad. This laptop comes with Windows 8.1 installed by default. I dont know of anyway to downgrade to windows 8 on it unless you have your own separate paid or download version. I do find there some bugs still with windows 8.1 and hopefully they will be fixed the upcoming windows 8 update 1. Its funny since windows 8.1 was suppose to fix the issues with windows 8, but, instead it created more issues.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Laptop for Creative Professionals", "Author": "David A. Beier", "ReviewID": "R2XTCI6T56GFK8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a long time, creative professionals who wanted a laptop for video editing, photo work, and light animation two choices:  They could go for a super sleek and portable Macbook Pro or get a Windows laptop which tended to be bigger and bulkier for the high-power options.  Recently however, a number of Windows 8 laptops have attempted to duplicate the mixture of power, portability, and high-quality design that one finds in apple's offerings.  The Dell XPS 15 Touch is perhaps the closest thing a windows user can get to a 15 Inch Macbook Pro Retina, and in some ways it surpasses that system which it's clearly attempting to mimmick.As someone who does a lot of video/graphics work but who isn't a big fan of Apple, I'd been looking for a laptop like this for some time.  Previously I'd opted for laptops which had a lot of power but those always ended up being so big and bulky that I hardly took them out of my house.  More sleek windows laptops tended to skimp on certain aspects of the hardware such as having a dedicated graphics card (very important for animation work) or enough RAM (which is essential for video work).The XPS 15 has pretty much everything a creative professional could hope for in this size.  It has a 4th generation i7 quad-core GPU (4702HQ); 16 gigs of RAM; a GeForce G750M graphics card; and a 512 SSD drive.  While there are certainly laptops out there with better specs, they're either far larger or are gaming-centric machines that tend to be incredibly expensive and usually lack a touch screen (something which I've found to be incredibly useful in day to day activities).  As strong as the hardware is, there are a few things that could have been a little better.  The 2.2 Ghz i7 4702HQ is a slightly slower but less power hungry version of the of the 2.4 ghz 4700HQ processor.  It's great for most things but I do wish Dell had given the option to upgrade to a slightly faster processor (either a 2.4, 2.6, or 2.8 Ghz quad core).  Both the 15 Inch Macbook Pro and HP Touchsmart 15 give users this option (thought he HP has a number of other issues that hamper its performance).  One also wishes that they had given the option for a slightly more powerful video card such as the GeForce 760M or 860M (found in some gaming laptops) which would have made certain graphics intensive programs like After Effects run more smoothly.  That said, both of these complaints are nitpicking.  The specs are some of the best you'll find and the only windows laptops that manage to top them are either way bulkier or are gaming laptops that are more expensive or lacking other features (like a touch/high-DPI screen).As far as the design goes, it's clear that no expense was spaired.  The metal lid and frame feel very premium and the XPS 15 manages to be both thinner and lighter than it's competitors like 15 Inch Macbook Pro Retina or the MSI GS60 gaming laptop.  When first saw pictures of the XPS 15, I was concerned about the keyboard as I thought the black matte surface looked cheaper and less sleek than the metal surface one finds in most ultrabooks and macbooks.  After trying it however, I actually love the smooth feel of the black matte (nice and soft to wrest your wrists) and the keyboard is surprisingly responsive.  The trackpad also feels great to touch though the software response feels a bit sluggish compared to a Macbook (most likely a problem with Windows rather than the hardware).  My only minor complaint is that the XPS 15 lacks the number pad of a full keyboard.  This seems to be another attempt to ape the Macbook Pro's design and seems misguided since many other windows laptops feature a full keyboard and the XPS 15's surface feels oddly empty without one.Ports are fairly plentiful with 3 USB 3.0 ports, 1 USB 2.0 port, a mini-display port, HDMI, and an SD card slot.  It's a good selection but, considering the price point and specs of this system, I'm not sure why they didn't also throw in a thunderbolt port.  Even though thunderbolt support is limited right now, adding this option would be another way to future proof this laptop which is clearly intended for creative professionals.The biggest star of the XPS 15's design is the touch screen.  At 3200 x 1800, it's even higher resolution than the Macbook Pro Retina screen and it's touch functionality puts it in a league of it's own.  As a PPS screen (similar to IPS), the viewing angles are also very strong and better than most other touch screens I've seen.  Finally, the contrast ratio and color reproduction are also amongst the best in this class.  One thing which professionals should keep in mind is that laptop ships with an improper calibration which over saturates the colors.  It looks really pretty but makes graphics work hard.  In order to fix this, one needs to open up the \"window mobility center\" and change the color profile from \"splendid\" to \"generic\" as well tweak few other settings using a calibration too.  Once you've done this however, the monitor is virtually perfect for professional use.I should also mention that the speakers are quite impressive, easily besting a number of other laptops I've tried.  One the subject of sound, it is worth noting that the system fan can get quite loud when it is triggered by a processor intensive workload such as video editing or gaming.  Thankfully, the often reported \"coil whine\" issue has not surfaced on my XPS 15 so I'm assuming Dell has fixed it in new models.The XPS 15 is a machine that just seems to scream \"premium.\"  I've mentioned the Macbook Pro 15 Retina a number of times in this review because Dell has clearly modeled itself after that machine and the philosophy of \"no compromises\" when it comes to power, design, and portability.  Simply put, you won't find a better laptop around.  The only knock against it is the rather steep price for the top model ($2300).  It's worth every penny and a better deal than most the macbook alternative with competing specs.  That said, a good options for those of us who want to save money is to search out a certified manufacturer refurbished model as they are certified to be \"as good as new\" from dell and can sometimes be found for as much as 40% less.  Either way, if you need a powerful work machine that's as portable as possible, you're not going to find a better option.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looks Nice. DID NOT WORK!!! HOURS OF TECH SUPPORT AND STILL NO SOLUTION!!!", "Author": "Nick Ballantyne", "ReviewID": "R4LEF1ND1LTKE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I am extremely frustrated with this product.  I received it and immediately upon booting it would not extend the display to an external monitor.  After hours of sitting on tech support Dell scheduled a tech to come out and replace the systemboard.  They did that and after the rebooted it had the same problem! I then spent another hour and a half on tech support and they finally decided that I needed to send the computer in for repair.  They said it would take 7-10 business days for repair.  A brand new $2300 laptop should not have these kinds of issues.  Being without a computer for two weeks is not a good solution.  I had already copied over all files and applications which took a long time and now I have to do that all over again on another computer so that I can work while this one is getting fixed.  Extremely frustrating, this is the second time I have had this major of issues on a very expensive dell laptop right out of the gate.  I will not be buying from Dell anymore.", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "The perfect computer!!!", "Author": "Jos\u00e9 Miguel", "ReviewID": "R39CL3V3X98FW1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this rating cause the computer I bought satisfies all my work necesities.I like this computer because it has very advanced technology and it will work for me for a very long period of time.I would recommend this product to people who needs a really high performance product to deal with new technological applications.", "Date": "April 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "BSOD on startup, and never wakes from sleep", "Author": "Mr. Wolfe", "ReviewID": "R2YZHJ4KNG4RFG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've only had this PC for a few days, and it has been a phenomenal disappointment, for the money spent.
