It regularly and predictably crashed with the blue screen of death after about 30 minutes. With reboot I got 30 more minutes of work done. When I came back I wasted hours with HP tech support. Finally I sent it in for repair. It came back with a new disk, motherboard, battery and a new video card with no drivers. After installing the drivers the video card works. But now the screen \"flickers\" and allows keyboard input only randomly. Windows update does not work. I sent it back for repairs yesterday. Will keep you posted on this saga.", "Date": "April 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Heat-Faulting From Day 1, Expired 1 Week Out of Warranty", "Author": "Toyotoomany", "ReviewID": "R2NYI3T2MD63I4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this computer in March 2012. It baked itself into non-boot-ability by March 2013, 10 days out of warranty.HP reps laughed at me and suggested I solder the computer back together.Look it up, HP has lost AT LEAST THREE LAWSUITS for premature failure due to video card heat. They have not changed their ways. HP reps thought it was funny that the public doesn't know this yet.If you buy a decent video card, your HP laptop WILL CRASH IN 20 MINUTES of video, with loss of data, singeing and property damage to the tabletop.Mine sat on a 1\" thick oak table, which it cracked twice due to extreme heat cycling. Plastic on the bottom softened into the singed cracks.Buying a $60 cooling tray extends video runtime before data-loss and crash to almost 30 minutes, but God help you if you take it off the cradle, or put it on your lap. 150 degrees F, second-degree burns, furniture damage, battery explosion risk, all due to completely unmanaged heat.Educate yourself about this company's lawsuit history and -80% recent stock price trajectory before buying anything HP! Used to be a great institution, but has been looted.", "Date": "March 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!", "Author": "fooman74", "ReviewID": "R1ESIU3JFU3TCE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my wife to use for her schooling and she loves it.
