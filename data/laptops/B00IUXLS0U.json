This comes as a huge disappointment. First product that I have had to return in the 10 years since being an amazon customer.As much as I dislike Apple; I would of chosen the Mac Air over this PC if I knew what I know now.Pros:-Sleek Design-Crisp screen display-Solid, sturdy built laptopCons:-I got the 128GB version.  After updating windows 8, I am only left with 59 gigs of free space.  This is before I have installed any type of program or application.-The description says it comes with 8.1, but the laptop I received only had Windows 8 and I spent 4 hours updating the laptop to get 8.1 installed.-The mouse trackpad sucks.  I keep trying to use the 2 finger scroll on websites, but for some reason it thinks I am trying to change the zoom instead. very frustrating", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "booting problem", "Author": "Roseroo", "ReviewID": "R35QHZZAVXJ8CB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Booting problem - loaded everything on it and it started acting irratic.

I only had Office installed, no virus, etc. I performed a reset but the problem persisted.Went to Microsoft Store one week ago to get a new machine, but nothing changed. I'm only using IE and it is always freezing, requiring a shut down all the time.

The design is beautiful, approaching perfection for an Ultrabook.  Unfortunately, a week or so into use, the system began to crash and reboot sporadically.  It would also not wake up from sleep properly, or crash when going into sleep mode, reboot into the BIOS and run hot in your laptop bag.  Occasionally it would freeze when waking up from sleep or hibernate.  I tried numerous things to fix it, and eventually gave up--not worth it.For this price, I don't want to hack around with instability issues.  Very disappointed as the Ultrabook is otherwise excellent.", "Date": "June 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "Better than previous version", "Author": "Michael Grosse", "ReviewID": "R3F8PNS0ABJQWS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the second Zenbook I've had.  It's a better option for me than an Apple product because of the versatility of Windows 8.1.  I wish the price was a little lower to be more competitive in their market niche.  I buy a lot of laptops for my company and this is the higher end model that is asked for.  It may not be as sexy as a Surface 3 Pro but is great for heads down computing.  You can't beat the weight either if you are a road warrior.", "Date": "June 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00IUXLS0U"}}
