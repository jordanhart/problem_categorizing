I'd had search on numerous websites looking for a deal which included newegg, frys, bestbuy, and walmart. All of which were out of my budget which is when I found this baby on amazon. I gotta say, this is the best bang for your buck as far as practically and price. At $315, this machine has exceeded my expectations! I thought it would be a lot smaller and slower both at which were incorrect. Has great hardrive storage and comes with 4 GB ram, I may buy some more ram so that multitasking would be much quicker. Right I can stream online radio, have 4-5 tabs open with different websites loaded (including me writing this review) without it taking to long to load each page but it could be faster with RAM upgrade. Overall, I think my brother will be very pleased with his new laptop, it will take care of his educational needs as well as entertainment.", "Date": "September 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for gaming, great all around", "Author": "Cblackwell7594", "ReviewID": "R3Q9W1VU36ECO2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop is perfect in every way- sleek, slim, great graphics, amazing memory, and lightning fast download speed (for a point of reference, it completely downloaded World of Warcraft in three days, which usually takes between four days and a week), and after installing the game, which is usually a huge drain on speed, memory, etc, I noticed no difference in performance.

Right out of the box, I put in the battery and I turn it on, but the screen stays black.

Once this was done and the rest of Windows updates we were ready to give it a go.First the screen is very nice I was surprised by this as I thought it would be more in line with budget quality screens.  The colors are sharp and bright.  Mom was very easily able to read the screen and test while using her Kindle app was crisp and clear.The speed is very good especially after the Win 8.1 update.Some people have reported problems with the WiFi staying connected and at first we did too.  By turning off the power management setting for the WiFi adapter in the device manager it stopped happening.  Apparently the most current driver that Asus has out does not bring it out of sleep and make it reconnect properly even if the system was in use or asleep.Once I changed the setting no more problem.  Hopefully this will be addressed in a future driver update.  Because the is an easy work around I did not remove a star for this.Battery life on this is excellent she usually get in excess of 6+ hrs of constant use using the internet and working on documents.Adding a SSD in the future will make battery life go even higher and speed up an already quick system.It is very light weight which was very important to mom.The only real con is the touchpad.  It can be a bit finicky until you adjust in the settings to more closely match the way you use it.The shared left and right mouse bar can sometimes feel sloppy.Overall I would recommend this to people looking for a speedy, light weight, fast laptop with a good screen.Tip: definitely get the Windows 8.1 upgrade before doing much with it as it really enhances your windows experience.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS", "Author": "Carla Gillespie", "ReviewID": "RDYHBZ7R68B7S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a gift for my son.

This laptop was $300.00 and several times better than what I was using before.I think it got a lot of negative comments, not because of the machine, but because of Windows 8. The first thing that I did was uninstall all of the software that I didn't need. There's a bunch of stuff from ASUS that is preloaded. I also opted out of a lot of Windows 8 tracking stuff. You need to go through custom installation and opt out when you first get your machine.One thing that is really annoying is the combination headphone / microphone jack. You can only use one device at a time. I tried splitting it with a 3.5mm splitter, EVERYTHING. I cannot get a microphone and a speaker to work simultaneously. However, I think if you get a microphone to USB adapter, you could probably get multiple devices to work at the same time. So, THAT has been very annoying.If you play some heavy duty games, the performance might not be great, but casual games are fine. What I REALLY don't like is that I can't read my kindle books on it because they aren't all available for Windows 8.1. I really hope this will be fixed.But if you're just doing normal Windows stuff and projects for school, working from home, etc. You shouldn't have any huge problems once you're set up.That being said. This is a deal! But you're have a few inconveniences for that deal.Also, registering for the warranty through Asus was a nightmare! Finding the serial code is a pain. You have to enter a bunch of information and then your computer doesn't connect to their server for some reason, so go STRAIGHT to their website, and do it there, because the autoplay wizard when you start your machine doesn't work at all.I could see why it is 3 on average, but I give it a 4 now that I've had it for a few months.

Took a while and a number of restarts but that was to be expected.  -> Day 1. 3x lost wifi connection. Had to click on the \"FIX THIS.. \" button to get it resolved.Day 2 -> installed office, adobe, no issues on install.  Lost Wifi connection once.Day 3 -> Mouse pointer keeps freezing. Had to force reboot 2x.I should have taken the best buy reviews more seriously. A lot of people angry with their purchase.A lot of issues with this computer:1.  Mouse pointer freezing2.  Webpages take 3-5 seconds to render completely and mouse pointer active for navigation3.  Free 30 day Mcafee will not scan. Keeps shutting off.4.  Have to click on things 3-5 times for it to respond.5.  Space bar doesnt respond all the time so have to double click on it sometimesLikes:1.  Lightweight2.  Pricei think the cons outweigh the pros. Will be returning to best buyupdate:Day 5i figured out the issue with the mouse pointer freezing, apparently after it did multiple updates, it disabled the mouse. I have never seen this before but there is a function key that has a mouse icon on it with a line on it. just clicking that function key returns the mouse pointer.Decided to give it a couple more days to see if all the windows update fixes its issues.Day 6seriously... i think weve experienced about 10 updates and about 15 restarts since then. how many windows update do you need? Some go for an hour. so today we disabled the automatic updates feature and maybe will enable updates when we leave the laptop at home.Speed has not changed. for yahoo main page, about 5 seconds to render fully. for netflix main page, about 30 seconds to render fully.

I'm still getting a feel for it. I find it curious that there's a convergence in the software-distribution model on all the major operating systems: W8, iOS, and Android.This little guy weighs almost nothing, takes up almost no space, has a great battery life, can run all the applications I've tested so far without any trouble, and its GPU can handle running an external 24\" monitor. It's highly functional, highly mobile, and for less than $300, it's a fabulous deal.My only real complaints are three: (1) no bluetooth (see more at *** below); (2) only three USB ports; and (3) the fans run quite loudly even when the machine is idling and both the laptop screen and the external monitor are turned off. Nonetheless, after roughly six weeks of ownership, I remain quite pleased with my purchase. By and large, it knocks the socks off a 13.3\" ASUS I bought two years ago for more than twice the price of the X401U.--EDIT, 2014.02.21: Although the GPU *can* handle most graphic loads on a dual-monitor display, such a setup seems to put the GPU pretty hard and leave it running pretty hot. I've had issues with streaming video (including here on Amazon, as well as YouTube and other sites) where the hardware buffering and processing just can't quite cut it and video displays as anywhere from slightly choppy to devolving into unwatchable, disjointed frames.Still, this is a great $300 laptop with exceptional performance for a machine in its price range. Even if it's not ideal for graphics development or hardcore gaming, it does that vast majority of what I want it to.*** The lack of bluetooth support is more of an issue (at least for me) than I'd initially found it to be or thought it would be; bluetooth devices continue to gain in popularity, the mere 3 USB slots that this machine comes with just don't cut it. Fortunately, multi-port splitters are readily available, such as Black 4-Port High Speed USB 2.0 Hub (about $5) and 7 Port USB Squid Hub (also about $5 as of this review date).", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "My ASUS Laptop", "Author": "Velda G.

I bought this  notebook to replace my Apple Macbook Air, which is gorgeous equipment, very light but very expensive. The Asus is nowhere near as sexy as the Apple product. I was also disappointed because this is a  Microsoft notebook computer. I did not realize that when I bought it. On the Asus you are too tied into the microsoft world. Each time you fire up you have to enter your Microsoft password and the defaults are always Microsoft defaults. Who needs that.  Still, in terms of price performance I got a good deal.
