Need to be careful in setup to avoid crashing", "Author": "Curry", "ReviewID": "RAACT1MLRZDYY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great product but you need to be careful in setup in order to avoid crashing and blackouts.Recommend following steps to enjoy this wonderful device:1. Read as much of favorable and unfavorable reviews on Amazon before powering up.2. Fully charge before powering up.3. Do not do any windows update until you do #44. Go to \"pc settings\" and  change windows update setting from auto install to \"download updates but let me choose whether to install them\". So much of crashing has been due to auto update installation coming off sleep mode or during booting(especially the large update right off the bat). Windows will let you know that there are updates to be installed. Now you are able to review and choose ones you want to install. More importantly, you are installing updates while the device is up and running (thereby reducing the risk of being locked out). I've had two instances of \"failed to install\" on updates during this manual installation but no crashing. When I retried to install on the next day, installation was successful in both cases. By the way, I have installed all updates so far.5. Asus has new BIOS update on their website - strongly recommend updating to BIOS 2206. Turn off three finger and edge gesture on touchpad.7. I use my Samsung galaxy note 2 charger with no problem. I think any Samsung or LG smartphone chargers would work. Its not any faster but has longer cord.8. Call Asus customer service with any issues. Generally they are helpful. If Asus recommend sending in for repair, try returning it to the retailer for exchange or refund first.9. Buy illumishield screen protector - your screen is no longer a fingerprint magnet.10. Get 64GB as 32GB is not enough.Hope above helps. This is a fantastic device, doubly so at this price.Update:I've had this device for nearly three weeks with no problem whatsoever. In fact, with Windows and BIOS updates, its performance has improved. For example, the touchpad works better and battery consumption during sleep mode has gone down from 5% per hour to 1%.I have kept my windows update setting to manual installation and do not intend to allow auto installation until crashing issues are completely resolved. There is nothing to lose by taking this precaution and judging by many Windows update related crashes still being reported, this is a prudent action.Update 2:Its been nearly month and half and this devise has mostly replaced my desktop. I bought 22 inch Samsung HDTV to replace 17 inch monitor. Micro HDMI to HDMI cable connection allows me to watch Netflix while doing email, web surf, or word doc on TV screen. Simply amazing.For the past week, I have changed windows update setting to auto installation with no issues - got tired of almost daily windows defender update.I still recommend new users to maintain manual windows update installation for the first three weeks. My daughter recently purchased Dell Venue 11 Pro (for bigger screen and slightly better spec) and got locked out after allowing automatic windows update installation. As is the case with T100, there is a large initial windows update on Dell Venue. The thing would not turn on no matter what we tried. She received a new one few days ago and needless to say, MANUAL INSTALLATION only.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fantastic value!....but with some caveats", "Author": "Jon", "ReviewID": "R1ZDQYJW1XH16I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This has got to be one of the best tech values besides the Nexus 5 and Nokia 520. Fro $350-400, you get a FULL FEATURED 10 inch Windows 8 tablet that comes with a keyboard dock! Tablet one second, netbook the other! Its a fantastic device that gets 5 stars for its superb value alone!+ Great screen! People online may gripe on the 720p display, but you'll never notice using it+ Battery life: Took it off the charger 7am this morning, and been using it straight since browsing the internet, viewing several Youtube videos both on Flash and Metrotube app, reading PDFs with Bluetooth and Webcam on. Now at 4pm, and still have 40% on the tank! Definetly liberating from netbooks where under clocking underpowered devices was a necessity to get that battery life. About as good as my iPad.+The Speakers! As an iPad owner, I'm impressed. Very clear and very loud. definitely betrays their size. I've never had reason to crank it up past 50% so far.+ FULL WINDOWS 8.1! This can't be said enough. I think almost everyone who has bought a Netbook did so to get a full Windows experience in a relatively portable format, where I do not feel afraid to use the device on a subway, and doesn't require me to bring a charger.+ This things a BEAST for its size. Wana watch a flash Youtube video while browsing the net on the same screen? No problem! Wana do some photo editing while watching said video? No sweat! Everything is buttery smooth on Bay Trail. Hell, it seems faster than my Core2Duo 2009 White Macbook that I've been using as my primary computer (very happily especially with Mavericks) for 4 years now.+ FREE DOCK!!!!+ MicroSD card slot: Format it so NTFS, and you have an additional 32-64GB Hard Drive, so space no longer becomes a big issue.However.......- The Dock: I REALLY want to like this thing. Truly. But its pretty terrible. The keyboard has the same configuration and size as my 1000HE, which I've been using regularly until recently (broken fan). But its for some reason a pain in the ___ to type on. I think its because the keys are recessed in to the case too far, and the boarders around the keyboard are too high. Makes it very awkward to type on. Keys are also a bit stiff, but I personally don't mind that too much. Also, like others are reporting, there's still Q/A issues with these: Bought it from BestBuy yesterday (32GB) so its a brand new batch. The space bar is already squeaking after just a days use. Now very difficult to type on. Gonna send it in for return.The Touchpad is also pretty bad. However, there's a way to make it pretty decent:1- realize that Asus put some stupid power saving feature to turn off the touchpad after 10 seconds or so. When you wana use it, just tap on it and use it. Small 6/10 second thing, but it makes it much more bearable.2- On the Desktop, double click \"Asus Smart Gesture\" on the bottom right where the Dock is (where you see your Battery indicator). Go to \"Edge Gesture\" and TURN THAT SHAITE OFF!!! Whoever thought that was a good idea in the first place should be fired! This thing already has the ability to do gestures with the touch screen. What's the point in adding all these unusable gestures to such a small touchpad? Leave it alone! The only gesture it needs is 2 finger scrolling. The rest is pointless.3- After that, go to Mouse Settings on the Control Panel and crank up both touch sensitivity and scrolling speed.So in conclusion, if you want a FULL 10 inch Windows Tablet that has a dock to use as a stand, case, and occasional keyboard, then get the Asus T100 without hesitation. Its perfect.If, like me, you are looking to get one as a netbook replacement, then wait a bit longer. Either until Asus fixes their Q/A issues, for competitor models that WILL be coming, or ditch the Tablet part and wait for the eventual touch screen Bay Trail netbooks.In my 1 day use, the tablet part adds to the Netbook experience. Complementing it with the fast processing and amazing battery life, this machine should be the Ultimate Computational Device.However, it isn't right now. My thumb is tired from hitting this squeaky space bar, so signing off!Edit: Just got back from Bestbuy to exchange the keyboard, and the overall response is much better. Think the keyboard was defective all around. If it holds up after the next few weeks, I'll bump it up to 4 stars. Still, be wary of the quality control issues on this product, and make sure you buy it from somewhere that has a very flexible return policy.Edit 2: Well, it's been a month and so far, so good! The new dock has shown no wear and is now holding up well. after about a month, it's staring to replace my iPad as a tablet. Not entirely, but it's getting there. 4:3 aspect ratio is still ideal for tablet browsing, and Windows store is sorely lacking apps...but considering that I never intended this little thing to replace my MacBook OR iPad, I gotta say Tablet internet Explorer has grown on me! And I haven't really touched my MacBook since getting this, as I am able to do all my editing fine with the T100.Another thing to be wary of: The plastics in the tablet are cheap. No joke. I put it in my book bag with the dock snug in a relatively safe compartment. Never banged it, or dropped it, etc. took it out, and found a very small crack on the side of the tablet. It's very small and everything works perfect, but considering the amount of drops and damage I've done with my old Asus Netbook, it's a bit disappointing it's that brittle. When in use, get a case for the whole thing. AmazonBasics has a cheap $9 case for 10 inch tablets that fits well and gives good enough protection.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Win 8.1 laptop/tablet - light, snappy, and smooth", "Author": "Andrew Peter Atkinson", "ReviewID": "R1R4B3XVAL90OS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using this unique machine for about five hours now (update below). Before I review it, I want to give some context: I regularly use the Nexus 10 for mobile computing with a keyboard - arguably the best screen you can buy on a tablet.  I also have the first Nexus 7.  I have tried to present on my Nexus 10 and it crashed the projector.  So I have been using my Asus 1201n running Win8.1 to handle all MS programs.Enter the Asus T100.  I didn't buy it for the tablet option, though that is useful.  I bought it for a few reasons - 10 hrs of Microsoft usage without plugging in.  Good touchscreen.  Light - very important - it must fit in my small shoulder bag with my Nexus 10 and a book without strain. Fast processor - at least four times faster than the Atom dual core in my Asus 1201n, which really was cutting edge in Sept. 2010 (still pretty solid).My initial verdict.Screen - you won't be upset.  Any rendering problems are Microsoft's and not due to the pixel count. If the pixel count was higher on this size screen MS rendering would make everything really small (Android is much better with this 10\" form). Asus's reading mode turns the screen a yellow hue, but may help the eyes. Touch functionality is exceptional - though reviewers say it only has 5 pt touch, not 10 (which used to be standard - not sure why this has been reduced - though I never use 10 fingers on the screen at once). Track pad is also quite good, though I'm not a clicker - I like to double tap - which this does well.Charging - slowKeyboard - cramped compared to my 12 inch netbook.  Cramped compared to my Bluetooth Motorola android keyboard (which is superb). But in five hours I feel like I'm already about 50% adapted to the key layout.  Way better than typing on the screen.  Definitely takes some getting used to.Processor and performance - Snappy.  This is not an i5 chip, for sure.  But you won't wait for anything to load when launching apps. This is my fastest machine - it feels like a work horse to me, but I don't do video editing and I don't play pc games.  I do regularly use ppt, vlc, youtube ripper, lots of chrome.  Let's say I'm an aggressive word processor, browser, ppt user.  This is ideal for me, though I could enjoy a 12 inch screen.  The biggest issue that makes the screen feel cramped is simply the small Win8 text rendering - which can be adjusted.My advice - I'd buy this over a Chromebook .  I'd buy this over the high priced but attractive looking Yoga and any other Win8 running Mac Book Air competitor (definitely buy it over a surface - you'd have to be crazy to pull the trigger on a surface pro over this baby). The 2gb of ram is much speedier on this machine than the 4gb ram in my Asus 1201n (that I upgraded).  I haven't had a ram issue yet and I'm running lots of programs and apps simultaneously.For what it is worth, I agree with most everything said in this review: [...]Enjoy!Update after a few days of use:The battery is exceptional. On a typical day I use the computer about 7 hours and I regularly have 30% left by the time I close the lid (brightness is set to auto adjust).  It also accepts a charge from my external battery pushing my mobile work time up to double the reported 10 hrs.I'm adjusting to the keyboard, but like many reviewers have noted, the right shift key is small and I often miss it.  Please note: the two feet of the hinge, which touch the table when the screen is up, can scratch a wood finish very easily.  I produced three scratches at home before I figured out what the sound was. Like one reviewer as well, my keyboard had a slight warp that made it wobble.  I've bent it back into shape.  Some parts of the construction seem needlessly cheap, like the warped keyboard and the glossy and sometimes flimsy back of the tablet.  Less like the Nexus 10 back and more like the lid to my old Asus 1201n.  You don't notice the flex until you pick up the screen in tablet mode.Overall, I continue to be impressed with the performance and functionality of the T100.  Win 8.1 is great on this machine. It is everything I wanted in Android that Google or MS won't allow - split screen, great multitasking, great MS Office experience. It has an awesome Baytrail chip with an exceptional balance between power and battery life. Rumor is, too, that once the first Android Baytrails are launched the T100 will be able to dual boot Android and Win 8.1.Update after one month of use:My concerns about the keyboard are gone.  I'm fully adjusted to the size and placement of keys and I can type as comfortably on this machine as I can on a full sized keyboard.  I did notice the reduction in size for about two weeks, then it faded from consciousness and my typing seemed normal.This is my daily driver - I have no need of any other computer or tablet with this machine.  I did load up a few indie games - particularly FEZ.  The  tablet keyboard combo seems to be ideal for this type of game.  You have about 10hrs of battery, so the only problem you will have playing relatively simple games on here is that they'll be difficult to put down.  My initial concerns about build quality diminish the more I use the device.  In my opinion this is the top of the pack for tablet and \"air laptop\" usage.", "Date": "October 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I expected...after some patience.", "Author": "Logan", "ReviewID": "R3CUUAD5KOW5TJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was very excited to get this device, so when I opened it  and wasn't able to turn on it on, I wasn't too thrilled to see that the manual told me to charge it for 8 hours initially. I can't blame the tablet for that. Going against my better judgment, the little kid in me didn't want to wait for that, so I turned it on after only about a half-hour of charge. I will say that during initial Windows setup, it shut off due to a lack of charge.... My fault. The reason I'm including that is because it is a possible cause of how the device behaved initially. The device while plugged in, seemed to not be charging or doing so at a very poor pace, as others have mentioned. It was sluggish, webpages were loading very slowly in desktop mode and in the Modern IE app. The WiFi randomly cut out, and most of the modern apps (The Metro UI) would open for a second and then force close with no error message. I was aggravated and very close to returning it. However I had read many reviews that lead me to believe that this was not the case for some people.  I work in IT, and I'm not a person who can just give up on a device like this without troubleshooting first, regardless of how strong the urge may be. The first thing I tried was a very simple factory restore, not thinking it would do much but it was worth a shot as a starting point. To my surprise, it worked. The device was suddenly much more responsive, the apps were opening quickly and not force closing, the WiFi was working fine, and the battery was definitely charging whether the screen was on or off. Also to address another review, the charging LED by the power button DOES go from orange to white when it is fully charged. While it may not be the fastest charging device, it charged a lot faster than my 3rd Gen iPad.Now to actually discuss a few things about the physical device. The Screen is nice, not as bright or pixel dense as my iPad was but the extra functionality I receive with Windows 8 is well worth the trade-off. Besides, I didn't really notice a huge difference when watching Netflix or Hulu. The difference was only noticeable with text, but either way it is still a nice and perfectly adequate screen with nice viewing angles and pretty decent color.As for build quality, I don't know what people are complaining about. I was expecting to pick this up and have it feel really cheap and light, and not a good kind of lightweight. This thing isn't too heavy but has a nice solid weight to it as well as the keyboard dock. I'm not saying it felt as \"premium\" as the iPad did, but it is perfectly fine to me and not just because of the price. The touchpad on the dock is a little erratic at times and doesn't feel great, but it works fine for me. The keyboard is a little small as well, but I'd still prefer it over always using the on-screen keyboard. I applaud Asus for including the dock at this price because to be honest using Desktop mode in Windows 8 sometimes requires a mouse or trackpad to avoid a lot of frustration from mis-taps.Overall, I'm glad I purchased this device. Anything intensive I can do on my desktop, though this little guy seems to be pretty capable. Obviously this won't replace your main computer unless you really only use it for web browsing, watching videos, and creating/editing documents (Comes with Office Home and Student for free..or at least bundled into the great price.) But it is great for what I do with a tablet and a little more. So if you order this and have issues with it, give it a chance and at least attempt a factory restore, which is very simple to do.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Terrific Ultra-Portable Windows Hybrid Tablet/Laptop", "Author": "GeorgieGirl \"GG\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z4L2TYYAC4KZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I\u2019ve had this computer for a week, and I\u2019ve been using it every day during that time as my desktop.  I didn\u2019t buy it as a desktop replacement, but rather as a portable desktop substitute for when I spend weeks or even months at another residence across the country.  However, using it as a full-time desktop during the past week has given me ample opportunity to enjoy its many attributes and get it setup for my next cross-country trek.I have had none of the problems reported by a few others.  From the moment I booted up the computer after its initial charge, it has worked perfectly.  Software updates and activations went smoothly.  I\u2019ve not had issues with screen flashes, reboots, or blue screens of death.  The wireless adapter works great, allowing me to communicate smoothly with other computers and peripherals on my home network.  I have no complaints about the build quality or the QA process involved in making this computer.  I do, however, have a few design complaints, though none of them would keep me from buying this device again.I knew the small keyboard would involve some compromises and a learning curve, and that has certainly proved correct.  The keyboard is a bit smaller than a fully size model\u2014which I knew before buying it, thanks to the reviews of others--and it takes some getting used to.  I was willing to make that compromise in order to get a 10\u201d, highly portable Windows desktop, and after using it for a while, I\u2019m satisfied with that choice.  The more I use the keyboard, the easier it gets, so I think this issue will eventually work itself out.  I\u2019d take a small keyboard over no keyboard any day.The short power cord is absurd.  It is so short that I can\u2019t even plug in the computer from a floor outlet while the computer is sitting on a table\u2014not unless I set the computer on the very edge of the table, making it unusable while charging.  Even then, the cord barely reaches the plug.  What was Asus thinking?  I solved the problem by buying a 6\u2019 charge cable to replace the one that came with the plug, and that works fine.  (If you go that route, be sure to buy a charge cable, not a data cable.)  The computer is extremely slow to charge, if you use it while charging.  Better to charge over night while you sleep.I also wish ASUS had included one more full size USB port on the keyboard.  For those of us who use a wireless mouse instead of the track pad, the only existing USB port is taken up by the mouse transmitter, leaving no open ports for something like a flash drive, which I use to carry around all my files from my desktop.  The micro USB port on the tablet can be used with an adapter (purchased separately), but that port is not available if you are charging while working.  So, the next solution is to buy a small USB hub, which I did.  Carrying around a hub would probably not be necessary if ASUS had simply included just one more full USB port on the other side of the keyboard dock.Now, on to the things I like a lot and why I chose this computer. . . .I have owned a number of Android and Apple devices, and while I enjoy them, I find them to be limited to entertainment and leisure activities.  When I travel for long periods of time I also need the ability to be productive.  For me, that means a portable Windows environment--something that I sorely lacked and which this little gem thankfully now provides.I have been able to set up this computer just like my desktop, with all the Windows-based programs that I routinely use, so that when I travel it\u2019s just like having my desktop with me.  That means I run Word, Excel, Visio Pro, and Adobe Reader with regularity for personal productivity.  I also maintain my own website and use light photo editing and watermarking software.  I have not experienced any speed or performance problems while using those programs, and I often have several programs running at the same time.  I\u2019m not a resource-demanding gamer, and I don\u2019t use the computer for activities related to outside employment.  If I did either of those, I likely would have opted for a more robust machine\u2014possibly the upcoming Dell Venue 11 Pro, which will cost significantly more for the same basic configuration, but will probably be faster and have options for a larger hard drive and more memory.  For my purposes, this computer will only see daily use when I travel, and that\u2019s usually only a few times a year.I\u2019m finding Windows 8.1 easier to use than the various Apple and Android devices I have, and I\u2019ve enjoyed customizing the Start menu to include all the programs I use for productivity, as well as some for travel and entertainment. The Start screen allows me to organize my programs in a way that makes them easy to find, and I like the instant start menu notifications included with many of the apps.In terms of apps, there appears to be nothing of significance that I can do on my Apple or Android devices that I can\u2019t do on this computer, but, then, I\u2019m not a big apps person either.  I spent quite a bit of time in the Windows store, looking for apps, and I found everything I needed that didn\u2019t already come loaded by Asus.  I have read that others find the app selection for Windows devices poor, but I found it more than sufficient for my varied travel, entertainment, and personal productivity needs.Besides wanting a full Windows desktop replacement, I chose this particular machine for four reasons:  1) its light weight and small size make it highly portable, even with a keyboard attached; 2) it has better battery life than most other options, making it more convenient for travel; 3) the detachable tablet provides the option of ditching the keyboard for even more portability; and 4) all other contenders\u2014both available now and soon to be released\u2014do, or will, cost significantly more for the same capabilities.  For my purposes, the significant extra cost just didn\u2019t make sense.  This computer does what I need, so why pay more?When I was looking at this computer, I was a little worried about the small hard drive, but that issue was easily resolved by the purchase of a 128GB flash drive and a 64GB micro SD card.  I have seen comments that the micro SD card \u201csticks out\u201d when inserted, but mine is flush with the outside edge of the tablet, making it no problem to leave in all the time.  I also purchased a small, lightweight USB hub and a micro-to-full-USB converter to allow me maximum versatility in communicating with other devices.  I created a car charger from a flexible, coiled micro-to-full USB charge cable and a dual car charger that meets the electrical specs for this computer (allowing me to charge this computer and my phone at the same time).  Add to that a really cute case, screen protector, mesh-tipped stylus, ultra-portable wireless mouse and pad, and a flexible USB data cable, and I\u2019m ready to hit the road and stay gone as long as I want without getting behind on anything.", "Date": "November 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "I like this tablet but there were initial quality issues", "Author": "T. Nelson", "ReviewID": "RWHQ9J4DGJZT1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've now had this laptop for about 6 weeks.  After some initial issues (detailed below), it has stabilized and become a favorite.  I've now owned an ipad, a Galaxy Note (Android), and this Tablet (Windows 8).  I have to say this is my favorite device so far.  There is a learning curve, though.Now that I've owned it a while, here are some of the pros and cons:THE GOOD-Lightweight-Good battery life-Decent build quality (for the price)-Great screen for surfing, watching videos, etc.-Easy to type on (once you get used to it)-Processor is surprisingly fast and 2GB memory is plenty, believe it or not-MS Office included and works great-Run Win 8 apps like a tablet or run \"real\" Windows programs like a laptopTHE BAD-The trackpad is pretty bad -- I use a mouse when I'm at a desk-The screen is a little wobbly where it hinges to the keyboard-It is VERY easy to popout the micro SD card -- you'll lose it if you're not careful-Every now and then it powers all the way down when sitting unattended (instead of going to sleep)-The Windows 8 app store is really limited.  A lot of the standards are there (Netflix, Dropbox, etc.) but a lot are missing (Pandora and YouTube, although you can run these with some limitations in a browser).SOME TIPS-Create a recovery \"disk\" using an 8GB thumb drive. This will free up much-needed space on your primary drive. Just type \"recovery\" from the Start screen and you'll be guided through it.-Get a micro SD card for additional storage.  I have 64GB which I use for movies and other large files.-UPDATE YOUR BIOS.  Before I did this I had all kinds of errors. I've updated the BIOS twice and it made a huge difference.FINAL COMMENTSThis device has a few quirks but I really love it, especially for the price.  It is GREAT on a plane where tray table space is really limited and battery life matters.  I like it enough that I bought a second one for my business partner.I recommend this device especially if you want/need to run Legacy Windows programs.------------------ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is a good tablet for the price.  As others have stated, Asus seems to have some quality control issues though.  On my unit, the headphone jack was dead on arrival, so I couldn't use the tablet with headphones.  I also have bluetooth issues; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  I often have to re-pair devices to get them to work.I returned the unit.  I'll try another and will update this review if I have better luck.  It's a severe bummer that I have to reinstall all my software, configure everything, etc.  That took the better part of a day the first time around.Some other observations:  The screen is good but not great.  As others describe it's not as bright as its competitors.  Perfectly usable though and videos, etc. work great.  I used the HDMI jack to play games on my TV and it worked well.Trackpad is meh but usable.  Yes, the buttons sound and feel cheap.  I find it works better to just click on the main part of the trackpad.I like the keyboard quite a bit.  My hands are small and I have no trouble typing fast on this keyboard.  Some of the keys are in different locations (arrows, etc.) so that takes some retraining.Windows 8 has a learning curve but it's not as bad as many people say.  Now that I've gotten used to it I like it better than my iPad.  It's a lot more powerful and you can more easily navigate between apps.  For me the ability to run legacy Windows software was a requirement so I find the Win 8 split personality perfectly acceptable.I would have given this 4 stars if it weren't for the broken headset jack and the bluetooth issue.  If my next unit is better I will upgrade my review.------------------UPDATE 11/20/2013:  Amazon replaced my originally-broken tablet with one that appears to be working fine.  I'm upgrading from 2 stars to 3 stars since everything seems OK so far.  I like this tablet more now that I've had a few days with it.  If the quality holds I'll update this review again.One interesting experience: I was dreading having to reconfigure the replacement tablet. However, an amazing amount of configuration happened automatically because Windows 8 remembered a lot from my first tablet.  So, most of the apps I had previously downloaded were already on the desktop the first time I fired it up.  Thanks Microsoft, that's a nice touch.By the way, both of my setup experiences worked fine.  No need to do complicated installs like some reviewers experienced.  I basically plugged it in, followed the on-screen instructions, and things pretty much just worked.------------------UPDATE 12/03/2013:  My replacement had a different set of issues related to powering up and down.  Interestingly, none of these occurred with the first tablet.  In any case, I believe these are now fixed (see below) but here are the details of the issues:* Sometimes after putting the tablet into sleep mode it wouldn't wake up.  It would require a hard boot (holding down the power button for 10-20 seconds to shut the thing off, then another 10-20 seconds to power it back on).  Sometimes it would take several tries to bring it back to life.  This was happening several times a day.* Twice when fully powered off, I picked up the tablet after a few hours to find it had powered itself back up.  When this happened, the battery would be well depleted.  This happened once right before a flight, so I had only 50% left for my cross-country flight.  (Fortunately there was still enough power to get from Orlando to Los Angeles...this thing has great battery life.)* When plugging or unplugging the tablet, it would often lock up and require a hard boot.  This happened about 50% of the time when plugging/unplugging.GOOD NEWS:  Yesterday I installed a BIOS update (version 220 dated 12/02/2013).  Since doing this, all 3 of these issues have disappeared.  I won't declare victory yet, but if it goes a few days without the issues, I'll be a happy camper.By the way, I REALLY like this tablet.  The more I use it, the more I like it.  The power issues were certainly annoying so I hope they are now fixed.  I'll come back in a few days with a further update.One other thing:  my tablet does not have the Windows logo sticker that many others have commented on.

It may not have full HD resolution, but I guarantee you won\u2019t notice the difference.  The display is super vivid and sharp.  The keyboard is a little smaller, but that is to be expected with a tablet.  I think the other reviewers are comparing this to a full size laptop.  This is not a laptop \u2026 but has all the features of a laptop in a very compact, portable size.  It weighs about 2 pounds with the keyboard/cover.  I especially enjoy the large 10.1\u201d display, and ease of use.  I use a stylus pen that I purchased for $10 to swipe and tap.  It keeps the screen free of finger prints.  I never got used to using a touch pad, not even with a laptop, so I connected a mouse using Bluetooth.  Now I have all the functionality of a desktop in a tablet.  My primary reason for purchasing this tablet is to take my work with me.  I am now able to access all my Excel files through SkyDrive, so a large hard drive is no longer an issue.  The 32 GB hard drive on this tablet is more than sufficient.  Now let\u2019s talk price.  With all its features, I only paid $340.  Dell\u2019s Venue comparable tablet with a keyboard is over $700.  Microsoft Surface 2 Pro is over $1000 with a keyboard.  The Microsoft Surface 2 RT is not a full functional Windows product, so there\u2019s no comparison.  The Surface 2 has many limitations, including Office.  You cannot run macros with Windows RT.  The Asus Transformer Book has the full version of Windows 8.1, so you can run applications like Java.  It is the perfect tablet for access to the Internet, Netflix, email, music and games.  You get full functionality of Office, and you can even set this device up with Google Chromecast.  Just install the Chrome browser.  Buy the TV adapter for $35 and you can wirelessly connect this tablet to your HDTV.  I know I must sound like a salesperson for Asus or Google, but I can assure you I am not.  I am just so impressed with this product, that I cannot say enough about it.  The bottom line:  The features are right.  The feel of this product is right.  And most importantly, the price is right.", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "A DUD!!", "Author": "Ambleside mom", "ReviewID": "R1Z7H8X4WD6KEK", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have used this for two days now and have to say upfront that I am very pleased with my purchase. Having spent quite a lot of time researching possibilities I settled on this one. The main reason was the incredible value, $379 for a tablet/laptop with full windows 8.1 AND full office and the new Bay processor chip.Read the reviews before you purchase, like I did. I agree with all the pros and cons that others have written but decided the cons did not outweigh the pros.I needed a small portable device that I could use for office productivity, that needed a long battery life, had a fast enough processor to handle several apps at once and was affordable - I found it!It has full flash capability so I can play Facebook games such as texas hold em and Mafia Wars and an assortment of slots. I can get my schoolwork done, I use google chrome and gmail - no problem there.The movie quality is very good, I don't aim to use it for taking pics (I have a very decent phone that can do that and take excellent video)I did take the advice of others and charge for 8 hours first, disable the trackpad gestures, will get a longer charger cable and a bluetooth mouse.I will start the updates today and will follow advice of others about not downloading them all but being picky, I will try and post more as I come across issues etc4DAYS AFTER THE ABOVE REVIEW>I was very picky with my updates and did not do too many but maybe one got through that messed it up because....I left the original review in so you can see how pleased I was initially and how happy with it when it worked. Just 4 days afterwards, I went to turn it on and it was stuck in a \"trying to load\" pattern. After Asus advice and other tips gleaned from other reviewers who had similar issues. I tried holding down the power button and f9 simultaneously in order to get to the screen to do a factory re-set. I made the screen several times but whatever sub menu I followed, it failed to bring me back to a working computer. It showed me it was erasing my files and was doing it but I have never been able to get back to the windows start up screen again. SUCH a shame because I really liked this computer, but I thought I could be one of the lucky ones and get one that works! I'm sending it back via Amazon today. So I would have to say - purchase at your own risk. This is not a one off item and seems to be a problem with the device. I'm waiting for my Dell Venue Pro 8 to arrive and see if I fare better with that.", "Date": "November 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best Tablet/Netbook Hybrid - SLOW charging issue solved!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2INTQTVOGPOP3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Rather than regurgitate other glowing reviews, I'll simply say that for the money, the 64GB version is the best Tablet/Netbook hybrid on the market with full Windows and MS Office installed. The keyboard attachment is rock solid and stays put, allowing it to be used, bounced...and possibly abused on your lap (others use some flimsy keyboard / kickstand combo..Surface..cough...ahem). Honestly, it's just silly how much you get for this price.Install \"StartIsBack\" for a few bucks and it even feels like a Windows 7 device (come on Microsoft, did you REALLY think your world domination scheme code named Tiles would work??). Oh, and yeah, it's not all rainbows and unicorns, the mouse trackpad left/right button clicks are terrible feeling and loud enough to wake zombies.  Right shift addicts will feel gimped by the tiny shift key.  But hey, real people use real mouses (mice?) and left shift anyhow =P.The maddeningly frustrating thing since getting this is it only charges fast with the included charger.  For those who lose the charger or think they can just use any uber aftermarket charger, most will trickle charge (and I mean TRICKLE) the device.  The included charger spits out 5V 2.1A, thus, logically, any similar 2.1A charger should work.  Right...To understand why this is NOT the case, one apparently needs a PHD in Dumb (charger only) vs Data (sync and charger) Micro B USB 2.0 cables.  USB 2.0 standards include 4 pins, 2 for power and 2 for data transfer. If the data pins are \"shorted\", your device knows it's connected to a charger only and will pull the max power it can.  If the data pins are not shorted in the charger and/or cable, how much power your device draws will depend on how \"smart\" it is.  If it's a bit challenged in the IQ department, your device will probably thinks it's always connected to a usb port for data transfer/sync and self limit it's power draw to 500mA (0.5A).  The T100TA apparently is in this \"dumber\" category and 500mAh will be like trying to charge a Nissan Leaf with a regular wall charger and patiently waiting like 6 months or something.My guess is the included T100TA wall charger is shorting the data pins, whereas many aftermarket chargers and MOST cables keep all 4 pins open. I thus provide THREE solutions for your charging woes:1) Get a 5V 2.1A wall charger that shorts the 2 data pins (I can't find) or is \"smart\":Innergie mMini AC15 Power Adapter2) Get a USB adapter that shorts the 2 data pins to make any charger and cable (car, wall, etc) \"dumb\".PortaPow Fast Charge Blackberry Charging3) Get a cable that shorts the 2 data pins to make any charger (car, wall, etc) \"dumb\".:PortaPow Specialised CordB0088HTYUE", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "20+ years experience with Windows computers, and I absolutely love this device", "Author": "Albert Ridley", "ReviewID": "RQAVHLUE07YO9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This tablet is exactly what I was looking for and more.  I could not be happier with the product, even with it's few glitches (more on that later).  I haven't needed to restore the factory default settings yet, even after several weeks of use, and that's saying a lot because when I first get a new device I load it down as much as possible to see what I can and can't use it for.So far the only thing this tablet cannot do is run Unity3D, a game engine I use.  I can connect to any of my live web/gaming servers and manage them as though I was sitting at my desk.  I can play any game in the Windows 8 App Store, and even run games from my childhood via DosBox.  I can manage SQL servers, send my girlfriend text messages, answer work e-mails, and control my XBox 360, all done seamlessly from this device.Cons:Sometimes the system just doesn't want to turn on.  I never need it enough for this to bother me much, and usually holding the power button down for 15 seconds or so will bring it back to life.  I am convinced that this is not the fault of the device, but is a WIndows 8 problem, since this only happens when there is an update to install.That's my only complaint.Pros: I could go on and on about what this tablet can do.  A full windows operating system on a 10\" (perfect size if you ask me) tablet that comes with Remote Desktop Connection pre-installed?  Games are easier to find, install, and remove than ever before.  All my previous software works (with the exception of Unity3D), and I've even gone so far as to install a standalone server on this tablet and it works just fine.  I can browse Netflix via my XBox with a few swipes of my fingers, and then when I play Halo 4 automatically connect to my stats page via Smart Glass.  A few swipes later and I've ordered formula for my daughter via the Amazon app, and then I'm playing Halo Spartan Assault and earning XBox achievements.  And when the Xbox One comes out, I'll even be able to control my cable television with Smart Glass.If you're a gamer, a quick search on Amazon and $15 will get you a usb receiver that allows you to connect a wireless Xbox Controller to this tablet for gaming.  If you have a non-wireless controller, you can simply plug the controller into the usb port on the side of the keyboard, visit the Microsoft downloads site for their Controller drivers, and then you're playing games on a mini-console.If you're a power Windows user, Remote Desktop Conn. allows you to connect to any server just as easily as with previous versions... actually, I think the new setup is actually sleeker, it just takes a tiny bit of effort to get things pinned to your start menu the way you want.  Full access to a command prompt, the ability to run standalone servers for testing, and even the power to run Adobe Photoshop (version CS6, I've experienced 0 problems other than fonts can get hard to read on the screen).  But, where this tablet really shines is that for a few bucks you can get a cable that allows you to plug this device into any screen with an HDMI port.  I've used this setup multiple times to convert my tablet into a drawing pad by hooking it up to my 23\" monitor at my desk.  The graphics driver will output fullscreen to a 1080p screen as well, but you will need to use only the larger screen, since the built in screen is only capable of 1366x768... otherwise you have black borders.  Also useful for gamers, this means that paired with the Xbox Controller, you have a mini-console that is also capable of playing on your tv.Misc:The first thing I did with my tablet was to learn everything I could about Windows 8.  It is unlike any operating system before it, and I'm not arrogant enough to think that I'll be able to figure out everything on my own, even with 20+ years experience with computers.Next, I turned off some gestures for the touchpad.  I'm not sure what Asus was thinking here, but the touchpad works terrible when set to factory defaults.  You can find the software responsible for this weird behavior in your taskbar (go to desktop [ Windows Key + D] and in the lower right of the screen there will be icons... find the one for your touchpad and open it.. there will be three tabs, each giving you customization over how certain gestures will work).  After this fix, my touchpad operated like a normal Win 7 laptop, and I was much less frustrated.I'll end this here.  In summary, this tablet is a power house for the price, and although I don't use the keyboard nearly as often as I though I would, it is priceless when you do need it, and that USB port opens up a world of possibilities.  Aside from the few booting problems, which I am convinced are a result of the OS, not the tablet itself, this tablet is batting 1.000 in my book.  Windows 8.1 has it's bugs, but none of them make the OS anywhere near \"useless\", and I've already decided since using this tablet that my desktop machine will be upgraded to Windows 8 and a touch-screen in the near future.Windows 8 is quite different from 7, and chances are you're going to have to do some google searches to figure some things out, but I'm not sure why so many people are giving this tablet bad reviews simply because they don't understand how to use Windows 8.  This tablet was awesome when I first turned it on, and now that I have everything customized for me, it's just incredible.  For instance, the default setting for a swipe from the left is to go back to the previous program.  As a multi-tasker that didn't work for me... and a google search later my device now brings up a taskbar when I swipe in from the left.", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "My companion in need.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2NIGRMQWTTG6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My background: I am a graduate student. I don't like pirated software. I already had a laptop before buying the Asus t100. This older laptop of mine weighed nearly 4 kg and was a pain to carry to school. And I desperately needed a light weight computer like device through which I could create and read documents and presentations via Microsoft Office. And, I couldn't afford Microsoft Office to install in my Windows Vista laptop.As the thanksgiving approached, I was in hunt for a tablet that fulfilled all these requirements. By some luck, I came across Asus t100 transformer notebook. I bought it in a lightning deal for $299 from Amazon.com. Here are the pros and cons from my point of view:Pros:- It comes with a full Windows 8.1. Since this is a tablet, Windows 8.1 is really easy to use with the touchscreen.- It has a Microsoft Office 2013 student (Only thing the student version lacks is Microsoft Outlook which I don't use; so I don't care about it.)- 64 GB memory (The maximum memory the best of the Android tablets have is 32 GB).- The cost includes the keyboard.- It is very lightweight- It can be used both as a small computer and as a tablet.- The screen can be tilted when placed on the keyboard.- Presence of a USB 3.0 port which means that I can use optical mouse/ pen drive/ external hard disk etc- Micro-HDMI port is also available (But you need to buy a separate cable to use it)- You can take handwritten notes in the screen using the One Note application (You need to buy a separate stylus for it)- I love the reading mode - The screen becomes yellow (like an old, well read book - I am reminded of my well worn Harry Potter books), and that makes it much more comfortable to read.- Sound quality is pretty good and it produces quite a loud sound for its size.Cons:- The screen might be a bit small (for people who like big screens)- The keyboard may be cramped for seasoned typists and people with big hands.- The touch pad is kind of small. (My suggestion is to buy a mouse)- The screen and the back of the tablet are fingerprint magnets (I bought a skinomi carbon fiber skin+screen guard to rectify this)I gave 5 stars for this product because this product exactly suits my needs. I am not a gamer (I don't play computer games); I am not a programmer; I am just an ordinary student. And this beauty has become my companion wherever I go. She is beautiful, talented, and understands and caters to my needs. Thank you, Asus for bringing out this beautiful product.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "ASUS T100 will Become the Next Nexus 7, another Blockbuster Bestseller", "Author": "Maverick", "ReviewID": "R1X02JY17J9PL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used to buy iPad only, but after Windows 8.1 I changed my mind. I have many iPads at home for my 7-year-old for the learning and entertainment purposes. However, I wish I could buy a notebook, both for my son and myself for productivity and project purposes, that can last the whole day without charging in between. And I've looked around the market for 2 years, today I finally found it at a very reasonable price point. I bought ASUS VivoTab one month ago and tested all sorts of functionality. It has been doing good, but not excellent. My son installed Minectaft Computer Version and it was running so slow that he couldn't even play it at all in the most desktop environment of Java Runtime/Virtual Machine.One month later now it comes to the market this little cute ASUS Transformer Book t100. To make sure its computing power, I went to Best Buy yesterday first to install Minecraft with Java and it runs perfectly smoothly, which means you can count on this tiny \"Netbook\" to do heavy-duty gaming or graphical design. At this price, you buy the fastest tablet in the marketplace, which sounds like a steal.And also, the full function keyboard can make you productivity suite run perfectly on the most portable machine. I've tried to buy a bluetooth keyboard and a bluetooth Mouse for my past ASUS VivoTab Smart ME400C, but it's very awkward and the bluetooth connection often lost from time to time. So, I decided next time I would like a tablet with the Original-But-Not-Bluetooth-Connection Keyboard.And this is it - ASUS T100, which is a fast computer even faster than my wife's working computer Thinkpad, with a free office pre-installed. Also I did a deep research and found 1080p is not good for Wireless Display function. 1366x768 resolution makes Wireless Display function work perfectly since 1080p Miracast Wi-Fi connection often drops due to several times larger real-time network data transfer than in the 1366x768 mode.Try to think, when you get in your office, your monitor, full-sized keyboard and mouse will be wirelessly connected to this fancy little cutie automatically; When you walk in a presentation room, you can use the big TV screen mounted on the wall in the mirroring mode as a second screen, wirelessly or via and HML-to-HDMI cable. When you go back home, your kid can unplug the keyboard to play Windows-Specific tablet games or just leave the original keyboard plugged to play tons of Legacy Online Java-based Learning Games.At this price, basically you got a so-far-the-fastest tablet, a free original keyboard, a free Office, sounds too good to be true. Actually, in terms of Wireless Display function, I got a better notebook on ASUS t100 even than my 14\" HP notebook with an I3 core, because my I3 HP hotebook processor can't support Wireless Display function at all.After I placed this order, I went to eBay buying a Samsung Pro 64GB micro SDXC for just a measly $21, then I got 128GB tablet+keyboard+Office in total so that I can download any youtube kids learning stuff as my son wants. For iPad Air at 128GB with a keyboard, you have to pay more than $1000, but it's still a toy, not as open as in the Windows Legacy platform. But this ASUS t100 can get my Word, Excel and Powerpoint jobs done on the go with my Verizon LG G2 phone's hotspot function anywhere anytime.Without Microsoft's distressed support, ASUS can't release a good product like this, because Microsoft is spending $400 million promotion to sell 16 million tablets like this over this holiday season. Compared to iPad Air, you only pay 1/3 price but can strike a good balance between home entertainment and work productivity.By the way, don't think the highest screen resolution is boon for customers all the times: I bought iPad 3 and it stutters once for every 5 minutes or so lasting almost an entire year and then Apple upgraded iOS three times I feel better, but after Apple forced me to upgrade to iOS 7, my iPad 3 stutters again now. I dug into the stuttering reason, I found it's the GPU/CPU A6X computing power issue, because iPad 3 uses 2048x1536 resolution, but its GPU is too slow to support, it can only run games at less than 30fps at ~17fps, making the stuttering issue happen all the time from day one. And Apple's Lemon Design has damaged Apple's reputation a bit and Apple has dumped iPad 3 like S***, making it the shortest-lived product in Apple's history.The only downside is the touch pad works not good enough. Because notebook at this small form factor, ASUS has combined two touchpad keys into one piece: this makes touchpad work stickily. You can try to lift your thumb higher to not touch he touchpad when you use your index finger to move the cursor around. Or you just plugin a USB mouse to solve this issue forever.Also, the full-sized USB port is very useful since past microUSB port can't read normal USB portable hard drive because tablet microUSB has no power output to power up a normal mechanical drive. Now, I'm waiting Intel-powered next generation phone so that Microsoft can combine Windows, RT and Phone three together into one product. By then, I guess within a few years, your phone will have a computing power simply as powerful as a desktop so that you can carry your pocket super computer anywhere anytime with a 24/7 wireless connection.To cut the price tag down, ASUS did cut a lot of functions: compared to past version Vivotab Smart, it lacks rear camera and many sensors like NFC Gyro... All in all, this will become ASUS's next Nexus 7 blockbuster, consolidating its No.3 position in the tablet world in the global market.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "CAUTION  32GB vs. 64GB", "Author": "James E.

Overall I really like this guy.  However, I did have some major software problems during day 1.  I'm going to cover them first before giving my impressions on actually using it.-------------------------------Everything was going swimmingly, I had activated Office and installed all my basic programs via Ninite and had a couple games downloading on Steam.  I went to close the lid and put it to sleep like normal.  When it came back up it started acting like the Win key was on turbo mode, continually switching back and forth from the desktop to the start screen.  I ended up having to Ctrl-Alt-Del and forces a reboot, but things got even worse after that.  It got stuck in a reboot cycle giving the same blue-screen error (can't remember what it was specifically).Eventually I did a hard shut down by holding down the power button for 30 seconds, then tried booting it up again.  That's when it did something really weird.  You know the startup screen Windows 8 has when you start a new machine for the first time, where it goes \"Preparing your apps\" and \"Getting ready\" or some such while rotating the background color?  It started doing that.  I could get to the Ctrl-Alt-Del screen and try to reboot, but it would just sit on the Win 8 preparing screen.  Very very strange.Long story short, I looked up the manual (Protip: F9 in post to get to Windows recovery) and did a full system reset back to factory.  Its a day later so far and I haven't had any other software related issues, though I will be sure to update this review if anything else happens.Its also worth noting a few professional reviews I had read also mentioned having similar troubles when first getting a T100, but they eventually subsided.-------------------------------So!  How is it otherwise?  The battery life was good enough to take me through an 8-hour shift with 25% remaining, and that was being on almost the whole time, web browsing with the screen at full brightness.  For the most part its pretty snappy, running Chrome and a few other programs at the same time without any delays.  Metro apps also run very swiftly, able to multi-task with no trouble.  I haven't tried any games on it, but it seems pretty capable of low-fi indie games and even some 3D rendering without too much trouble.  The keyboard is cramped, but its very usable with some practice (this coming from a 6\" tall gentleman with large hands).  The trackpad is awful with poor tracking and a terribly loud click, but I use a bluetooth mouse or the touchscreen anyway when using it in netbook mode, so not that big a deal for me.I would've liked to have a few more ports in the keyboard, like a second USB port or a full-size memory card slot.  One must make compromises at this price point I suppose.  I stuck a microSD card in, and while its not flush with the casing it does stay out of the way so I don't worry about accidentally popping it out.  Its also a little annoying that the finishes on the tablet and the keyboard do not match.  I would've much preferred having the matte plastic from the keyboard on the tablet as it is a smudge magnet.  Also, there's a slight amount of lag when you push the power button before it wakes up, sometimes as much as a second.  Just a minor annoyance, but worth noting.Overall, I take off one Star for the software issues.  Hopefully Asus can get their quality controls to take care of these problems going forward, because once its up and running this guy is a fantastic compromise between size and battery life while haven't a good display and fantastic performance for the price.---1 Week Later Update---No more software problems to report since that first day.  I've been taking it to work with me daily and using it as a tablet in bed.  Battery life has remained strong and its able to get me through a full 8-hour shift at work.  While not a big deal for a tablet, not needing a power brick is extremely convenient for keeping an AC adapter handy for an x86 machine.  I'm  still really not keen about the glossy finish on the tablet, but oh well.  In netbook form it sits nicely on a flat surface, but it is a little top-heavy and may balance backwards a little in the lap; not enough to fall over or anything, but it seems to want to stay parallel to the ground to be balanced.  Overall I'm still giving it 4 stars because those day-one software issues were extremely annoying and would've prompted a less tech-savvy person to simply return it.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Review of the T-100 with 64 gb Storage PLUS - POSSIBLE SOLUTION to Slow Charge issue...and Other Tips", "Author": "PositiveLogic", "ReviewID": "R3G9DS6VRY7TA9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted to like this and guess what? I do!I am so pleased with this purchase, that I not only want give you my feedback on it, but provide a series of insights that will help you to get the most of your T-100.WHAT IS IT AND IS IT FOR YOU?The Asus T-100 is more of a tablet with attachable keyboard, than a laptop with a detachable screen. I think those who have this perspective are mostly likely to be happy with their purchase. However, in terms of functionality, it combines the power and versatility of both a laptop and a tablet. It is one of the very new generation of tablets that take advantage of Intel's new Quad-core Bay Trail Atom processor. You get the full blown Window 8.1 experience instead of the underpowered and lightweight Windows RT, plus a keyboard that is well-integrated with the tablet.Just how powerful is the Bay Trail inside the T-100? It's been benchmarked at 6,279 MIPS, which is not far under the i5 processor. Yet, it runs cool (no vent or fan needed) and runs long, up to 11-hour battery life.Also, in spectacular fashion, it fulfills a promise that was made in 2012, when Intel promised that Ultrabooks would provide us with lighter, faster, cooler-running notebooks with longer battery life. Looking back with 20/20 hindsight, they failed. I know because I have two a highly-related Samsung and HP Ultrabooks. Both are are better from traditional notebook computer. But they still cough, sputter, and boil their way through the day only offering minor improvements over conventional laptops. Yes, I've written positive reviews of the Ultrabooks I own. But in the big picture, the more I've used them, the more they seem to be better than average notebooks, but not game-changers.Chromebooks and iPads, which I also own, are useful and fun. But the bulk of the serious business still gets done on my Windows-based computers.Now, into Day 11 of ownership, I'm feeling that the T-100 finally delivers on what Ultrabooks were supposed to have delivered two years ago, when Intel first promised, but failed to deliver lighter, faster, cooler-running notebooks with longer battery life.The T-100 is an easy to carry-around portable with the power to get serious work done without worrying with enough juice for a day at Starbucks or flying from L.A. to NY.HERE'S WHAT I LIKE about the version with 64 gb (no 500 gb hard drive) which I believe is the best version to get:\u25ba You get full blown Windows 8.1. So now you can run most if not all the desktop programs you've been running on your Window 7 and XP computers. Thus far, every app I'm tried works fine on the T-100.\u25ba Fast. I have two laptops running an i5. My T-100 seems to perform as well as my two i5 ultrabooks. Further boosting performance is the 64gb of blisteringly fast Solid State storage. I strongly recommend getting the 64gb version instead instead of the one that includes the 500gb hard drive, which will dramatically slow down your performance.\u25ba Boots up fast as fast as my iPad Air. It goes from \"off\" to login screen in about 7 seconds. After I enter my long password, I'm at the Metro screen instantly with no lag. Once there, it's really operating at optimum speed, until conventional computers whose hard drives are stuttering booting up background processes 5 minutes after you pressed the \"on\" button.\u25ba Small and lightweight with no fan or vents. The tablet with the keyboard attached feels no heavier than my Chromebook. Best of all the new architecture of Intel's low-power, but fast Bay Trail microprocessor allows the T-100 to run with no noisy fan or van. Now you truly perch a real Windows 8.1 machine on your lap, couch or  bed -- while actually getting real work done.\u25ba Windows 8.1. Yes, I was a skeptic, but I after a couple of days of adjustment, I truly see the genius of the Metro interface. It's just like the icons you see on your iPhone or Android, only better. With the flexibility to re-size and change the colors of the tiles, you have much better sense of visual hierarchy.\u25ba Touchpad works fine.\u25ba With table attached to keyboard, it opens and shuts just like a laptop. Some people have commented the angle of movement of the screen is not big enough. I think it's fine.\u25ba Media Player is far better than native Video app on iPad Air. 8.1's media player allows you precisely move to specific time in a time in a long video your watching. This is not possible in the Video in the iPad Air.\u25ba Comes with Windows Office.THINGS I DON'T LIKE\u25ba It takes too long to charge. But have a possible solution that works for me (later in this review).\u25ba No hard disk means there is no indicator that tells you the T-100 is processing something. So there are times when you're wondering if it's frozen or \"thinking.\" This doesn't happen often, but it is slightly disconcerting.\u25ba Asus Cloud Storage Nag pop-up. I'll explain to you how I silenced it in my Tips section below.\u25ba Cheap plastic netbook look. The Asus T-100 is substance over style for sure.  But I also have solution for that.\u25ba Not all that many great apps in the Microsoft App Store. While I got the T-100 in order to run my business-related applications, it would be nice to install some of the great apps that I have on iPad and Android phone. But there's really a great lack in this area that I hope Microsoft eventually overcomes.TIPS TO HELP YOU GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR ASUS T-1001) How I addressed the slow-charge problem. First, let me give you the following disclaimer: I am not recommending the following as a solution for anyone to blindly follow in order to shorten the ridiculous amount of time it takes to fully recharge the ASUS T-100. I have no idea whether it can impact the longevity of the product. Proceed at your own risk. Given that, the ASUS T-100 comes with 2.0 AMP charger. I looked for a \"fast charger\" and found one from a reputable company that makes a 2.4 AMP charger. Now, rather than having to leave it plugged in overnight, my T-100 is fully recharged in 2 or 4 hours.2) Add a 64gb (or 128gb) Class 10 UHS 1 Micro SD. This is the one I got: Sony 64GB microSDXC Class 10 UHS-1 Memory Card and you'll double your storage. Move your big data files (such as movies) and you'll have a decent amount left for your apps.3) Don't fight Windows 8.1. Surrender to it and you'll develop a full appreciation of Metro by using the touchscreen. I think you'll come to like it more than the Windows 7 interface as long as you recognize that is for today's users who are getting more and more accustomed to tapping icons on their phones. I really prefer this over Windows 7 now. It far more more efficient than the old START button.4) Get rid of the Asus Cloud Storage Nag. I did this by signing up. But because I didn't want to get dinged a year from now for having to pay for a Terabyte storage a year from now, I'm identified the icon in the System Tray and disabled it by right clicking and closing it.5) Get a case for both the Tablet (VSTN\u00ae Asus Transformer Book T100 ultra-thin Smart Cover Case (For Asus Transformer Book T100, Black II)) along and the for the keyboard and the table attached together (IVSO\u00ae ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity T100 10.1-inch Leather Keyboard Portfolio Stand Cover Case (Black)). These thick cases that go directly against the grain of the \"thin, light and beautiful\" trend that has been in place since the first iPhones came out. But I really think they increase the visual appeal of the T-100.Overall, the ASUS T-100 has surprised me in a good way. I initially thought it would be under-powered and was dreading Windows 8.1 I was, thankfully, wrong on both accounts.I thought I was getting something more like the netbooks of two years ago. Instead, I see this as being a revolutionary product which provides versatility and power on the go for Windows users and quite possibly give Apple a run for their money.UPDATE 5/29/2014 FIXING A BOTTLENECKWow...in just the few weeks since I purchased the T-100, there have been a boatload buyers with reviews across the spectrum between love and hate.For anyone interested, I discovered an Achilles Heel that this laptop has which is very solvable. In spite of the it's Bay Trail microprocessor and Solid State Drive, I still experienced frustrating periods during which the T-100 seems to hang. But what I discover is that the hanging is not due to processing. Rather, it's due to the weak Wifi radio that's built into it.How do I know that? Simple, I found the T-100 running slow. I happened to walk closer to Wifi transmitter and instantly, it was racing like a Ferrari. With this evidence, in mind, I did some research and wound up buying the Medialink Wireless-N USB Adapter (300 Mbps) - 802.11n, 2.4 ghz - Compatible with Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Windows Vista / Windows XP.It was easy to set up.

I have a gaming desktop but wanted something I could carry around and do school work on as well.  I bought the $250 Samsung Chromebook.  While I love the idea of the chromebook, it didn't fit all my needs.  I still prefer MS Word over Google Docs.  I could have used Libre Office in Dev mode or Office 365 for a monthly fee.  I didn't want either of those options.  I also wanted to play some of my lower end Steam Games which was impossible on the Chromebook. Any school software that requires an install also won't work, but I knew that beforehand.  Luckily, I didn't have any of those problems.I had some minor surgery this past week and decided to try out the T100 while confined to the bed. Turns out I really love it, and I have decided to use it as a replacement for my school laptop/tablet.  I'll try to point out some Pros and Cons below.  Let me start by saying that out of the box I did a full charge, which took several hours.  Initially I just installed Google Chrome and Google Drive along with uninstalling Asus's online storage backup software.  Perhaps something didn't play right, but I had plenty of problems with downloading any Windows Store apps after that.  They would hang in pending status.  I did research and tried several online suggestions. I finally reset the PC and decided not to uninstall the Asus bloatware.  Second go round everything was smooth.Pros:*Free Dock - Some people complain about the quality or small size.  I tried to lightly bend the dock and it would not give.  I saw online videos of people who had docks with a slight give.  Mine did not at all.  Maybe I got lucky or I got a batch with better quality, no idea.  All I know is my dock is sturdy.  It took me less than 30 minutes to get used to typing on it.  I also have pretty small hands for a guy, so maybe that helped.  So far I haven't had any trackpad issues either.  It is hard to press it down, but then again I don't use that function.  I just use tap gestures and it works for me.*Windows 8.1 - I can install Steam and play Civ5, Torchlight 2, FTL, and several other simpler games without issues.  This is a nice bonus for a small machine that isn't meant to be a gaming beast. (On a side note, WS has several great games...Halo Spartan Assault, Game Dev Tycoon, 4 Elements II, Radiant Defense, Gunpowder and many more.)*MS Office - This is a big deal.  Originally only the RT devices came with office.  Now this 8.1 tablet/laptop has full Home/Student office.  Can't get much better than that, $140 software value.*Overall build quality - It's not a 5 star quality build, but is great for the price.  The back is sturdy, no bending or flexing on my device.  I know some had said their version had flex but mine does not.  It feels solid.Cons:*Keyboard - Even though I listed the dock as a positive the actual keyboard is not as nice as my cheaper Chromebook.  The build quality was good for me, just typing wasn't as nice as the Chromebook chiclet keyboard.*Smudge city - This thing is a finger print magnet.  I wish the back would have been matte.*4-5hr charge time - The included cable is tiny.  You'll want to purchase at least a 5 foot cable and charger separate.  It's ridiculous they even include such a joke of a charging cable.  I wish this thing charged as fast as the Surface tablets 1.5-2 hr full charge, but sadly you'll have to do a full charge over night.Conclusion:For a student or someone wanting a tablet that can serve as a cheap functioning laptop, then I think this is a great choice.  I've had no stuttering in games or videos that I've played.  You get full MS Office.  I would encourage you to buy a better charger and a 64gb sim card.  Install your Steam client or any other windows software to the sim card.  Whatever you install off the Windows Store will use the SSD.

Actually, this is the second one, as I returned the first for the current because it appeared to be faulty (premature determination). The reason I returned the first one is because I couldn't get it to turn on after the first time. The second unit had the same issue, but I figured out I could hold the power button down for about 10 seconds (hard restart) and it would turn on.This was unacceptable. I updated the BIOS from the Asus site and the issue was fixed. I've been going 6 days now with no problems.I bought this to replace an older Archos 101 that gave up the ghost. While researching a replacement, I had pretty much decided on a Google Nexus 10 2013, but there only rumors about whether it even existed. Then, I came across a review about the Asus T100ta. I had looked at the Surface Pro, but it cost a lot more than I was willing to spend. This is actually what I was looking for and I didn't even know it. Full Win 8.1 (as opposed to Android), keyboard, 64GB storage, microSD slot, USB 3.0...wow. And just $379. Oh, did I forget to mention Office 2013 Home and Student?Yes, it takes a while to initially charge it (mine took about 5 hours). Yes, I had to manually update the BIOS before it worked properly. Yes, the keyboard is a bit cramped. A few shortcomings, but I love it. Battery life (after it's fully charged) is like forever (well, around 10 hours). You can run any Windows program. I can even VPN into my work computer. You can really type. Screen resolution is very good (not excellent). I'm not a fan of Win8. In fact, this is my first exposure to it. However, on a touchscreen, I'm comfortable with it, after reading the tips.I am very happy I made this purchase as opposed to another Android slate. If you're of the fence about buying one, go ahead and pull the trigger.Update 11/28/13: No more fingerprints! I bought the Skinomi TechSkin - Asus Transformer Book T100 here on Amazon. It is lazer cut to fit the T100. It is a skin that mimics carbon fiber and sticks to the back of the tablet portion. It has cutouts for all the buttons, ports, speakers, and even the Asus logo. The fit is very good, but I did need to trim around a few of the ports with a utility knife (I'd recommend an X-acto knife though). This very minor surgery may not have been necessary had I been a little more careful with the application of it. I started from the middle to ensure the Asus logo was properly aligned. If you do it this way, you may want another person to help you by holding up the side you're not working on and working one side at a time.This skin makes the transformer look a lot more upscale.

I saw the bad reviews about updates causing problems when the t100 is not fully charged, and wanted to be patient.  Amazon delivered a day earlier than expected, so I had that going for me.Day 2:  After powering on and testing a few things out, I decided to apply updates, using ASUS updater utility.  Shortly afterwards, the computer notified me that it had \"encountered a problem and needed to reset\".  When it restarted, it went into the Aptio BIOS utility and would not leave, despite trying to exit many times.  Finally, it appeared that if I held the power button for 20 seconds or so, it finally did restart.  I applied a factory reset immediately.Later in the afternoon, I re-ran the ASUS updates successfully, then ran through the Windows 8.1 updates.  So far so good.  I activated MS Office successfully.During the course of the day, I noticed that the battery was draining, but wasn't too surprised... updates require downloads and computational power.  However, when left alone on the charger, it didn't seem to be charging.Day 3:  Charge down to 15 percent, even though on the charger all night.  Start it up and within 5 minutes, it shuts down unexpectedly and goes back to the BIOS utility.  After 30 minutes of frustration, finally I remember to hold the power button down for an inordinate amount of time.  The battery is now even lower, so I plug it in while working on it.  I looked online for info on battery charging and see that people have had problems with the included charger, so I pull out another to try it.  When I unplug the cable, everything goes dead because the battery is fully discharged.  After impatiently waiting 50 minutes, it finally can turn back on.  In the meantime, I had checked the ASUS charger by successfully partially charging my phone.  There don't seem to be any problems with the cord or charger.Within 20 minutes, the thing turns off again due to an unexpected error.  Of course, the battery is now too depleted to restart.I want to like this thing.  It is small. It includes office. I can, in theory, be productive on it (compared to my iPad or Nook).  I've rooted nooks and phones.  When doing that, I expect some bumps in the road.  When buying and using the stock software, I expect it to just work.

The netbook was slow and the iPad was less functional than I wanted for a work station so the death of the netbook led me to renew my search, and finally I landed on this.This is everything I wanted in an affordable package and from a long standing leader in PC hardware (an industry leader on motherboards for a long time). The end result - pure magic.I also have to give some major props to MS for the new Win 8, it might be kind of ugly looking at first glance with its simply blocky looks, but it is super fast booting and with a little getting used to is (I am finding) vastly superior to iOS in terms of balance between features and simplicity. The ASUS Transformer includes the full Win 8.1, not the scaled down simplified version which only includes the blocky app screen but no desktop. This translates into instant transfer back and forth between two screens, a full desktop screen and a tablet app screen, which translates into BRILLIANT! I have mostly at this point been using the desktop but the app screen is great for alerting you to your schedule (which once you log in to outlook it automatically syncs with your contacts and schedule) and the arrival of emails. Put this together with a tight and super functional hardware thanks to ASUS and the result is pure gold that doesn't break the bank.Here's a sum of the features that make this book the best bang for your buck:1. I'm no tech geek but I respect the hardware specs in this and easily eclipses iPads (8 gig HD still being standard, or pay the 'apple tax' to double that for 100$ - this has 64 gigs, about half you get to use thanks to Windows, but also have USB connections, one 3.0 on keyboard and one mini on the tablet, and a micro-SD slot, so memory is not critical like iPads), the screen is clear with brilliant coloration2. Functionality of an integrated keyboard/touchpad cannot be overrated - this is lightyears beyond what I was able to achieve with my iPad setup and disconnecting from the keyboard is easy just the touch of a button (it also secures into the base very well and there is no wiggle - a very well designed package)3. Software - full Win 8.1 plus free MS Office (compare to the Surface and the price difference is shocking) and this thing handles the full Windows without breaking a sweat (you also get access to a 1000gb ASUS virtual memory internet drive if you think the 64gb HD is too small)4. Design is simple but very functional, after a little getting used to all the buttons and whatnot are easily accessible and they also got rid of a lot of the extraneous buttons that have come to plague most PC-booksUltimately the looks of the Transformer don't make it stand out in a crowd, but put all the features together and this thing is the best deal on the market - I couldn't be more pleased with it!", "Date": "November 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great value and concept, questionable build quality", "Author": "J. Williams", "ReviewID": "R12L28KCXWQ3QC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm a lifelong Windows user and I rely on it for work, but up to this point all my mobile devices have run Android (including two phones and two tablets). I've never been a big fan of Windows 8, and I think Surface tablets are overpriced for what they are. Still, when the ASUS T100 was announced, it was like a light bulb turning on in my head. A 10\" tablet that can also be used as a real laptop (with a real hinge!) running full Windows 8.1, including desktop apps, for only $399?? I could take this thing on business trips, use it like my regular laptop, and not have to lug a 6lb. machine around in addition to my Xoom! It would kill two birds with one stone - upgrade my old Xoom tablet to something new, and consolidate my travel laptop and tablet into one machine.The fact that it came with a full version of Office was just icing on the cake - I had all but decided to buy it before I even knew that.So far, I'm liking it a lot, but with a few caveats. First, the good points:* This type of machine is really what Windows 8/8.1 was meant to be used on. I don't even think MS itself is really getting it right with Surface. It can't be overstated how important it is to have a keyboard dock with a real hinge, so you're not relying on a stupid kickstand to hold the screen up in your lap. A 1 lb. keyboard with a hinge makes it feel like using a real (very small and light but slightly top-heavy) laptop. And when you do want to switch over to the \"Modern\" UI for tablet use and/or media consumption, just press one button and undock the tablet - voila. This feels like the future.* It's a pretty snappy machine, unlike the Eee PC netbooks that it's the spiritual successor to (ASUS calls it a direct replacement). It doesn't have the RAM to be a real multitasking powerhouse, but in regular use it always feels quick and responsive, in either the desktop or modern UI.* It gets great battery life. I haven't done any formal tests but I can use it for what feels like a full day and still have juice left when I go to bed. ASUS says it's \"up to 11 hours\" and I've seen tests that show anywhere from 8-10 depending on use, but since you don't really use any machine non-stop without a break for that period of time, realistically most people should expect a full day.* Full Windows 8.1 and full Office - I mean until this machine (and others based on the new Bay Trail CPU's) was released, you just didn't see that at this price point on a convertible. It's a great value. You can run all your regular Windows desktop software on this machine.Keep in mind these good points are all *really* good things, so even though there are fewer of them, they still outweigh the bad points.Now the caveats and cons:* No sugarcoating it - it's cheaply built. My wife has a later model 10\" Eee PC, also from ASUS, and that thing is a tank compared to the T100 even though it actually sold for less. The T100 is made of thin, glossy, fingerprint attracting plastic that greases up and flexes easily, the keyboard keys feel hollow, and the touchpad isn't even flat. I thought mine was defective but you can even see this in some of the official photos (from the right angle). I think some are just worse than others; the top of my touchpad is actually above the bezel. ASUS is clearly putting their production costs into the included software with this machine (full Windows 8.1 + full Office 2013), not the hardware.* There are hardly any ports - just one USB and one mini-HDMI, plus a MicroSD card slot. You could argue that a lot of ports aren't necessary on a machine like this, but my wife's Eee PC has three USB ports, a full size SD card slot, an ethernet port, and even a VGA port. Keep in mind that the Eee PC is roughly the same size, but I'd even accept the dock on the T100 being slightly thicker. Ok, a VGA port is probably frivolous, but I'd love to have a full SD card slot (so I could more easily transfer photos) and another USB port. Relatedly, the MicroSD card hangs out of the slot when you have one inserted - like you're not meant to leave it there permanently to increase storage. My Xoom has a door that closes flush when you have a card inserted, so you can just use it as permanent storage without worrying about it.* No notification light, in fact no lights of any kind other than a charging light. I like to know when I have email without turning the machine on, and I also like to see drive read/write activity (important even with SSD's, just to know what's going on).* The touchpad lags if you haven't used it for 10 seconds, like it's gone into \"sleep\" mode. I'm still searching for a setting somewhere to fix this and I hope there is one - this is probably the single most annoying thing about using this machine. It only applies to laptop mode, obviously, and I've started just touching the screen more to get around it, but having a touchpad for things like desktop Photoshop is one of the main reasons I bought this machine over another Bay Trail tablet, so I really hope I can fix this in software.* Windows as a tablet OS is still pretty rough compared to either Android or iOS. For example, there's no central notification area. Xbox Music doesn't seem to let you store and stream your music from the cloud. There's no first-party bookstore. Kindle, which comes preinstalled to make up for that, doesn't sell magazines through its Windows app. There's stuff like that all over Windows 8.1 that is either missing completely, or implemented poorly compared to the competition. That's not even considering missing major third party apps like Pandora, HBO Go or PayPal.This isn't ASUS' fault but it is something to think about if you're like me and considering this machine vs. just buying an iPad or Android tablet and a separate keyboard. What it comes down to is desktop software and whether that tips the balance for you (as it did for me). On tablet merits alone, I would certainly buy something else - there are much better built tablets out there running better tablet OS's with more app support for around the same price or even less.But if you do need to run desktop Windows software and still want tablet functionality, there's probably no better value than this machine right now. Someday there will be - there are clearly things ASUS could improve here, and either they or somebody else will at some point while maintaining the low price point.

It has shortcomings, but it makes up for those with aplomb.  I'm going to go over a few points that I think will be helpful (and I already wrote for ars).BugginessTo start out with I think Asus released buggy software at the start. Online you'll see a few different revisions being sold and I purposefully bought what I believed to be a later model and have had zero issues with keyboards, black screens when charging etc... My trackpad also seems to work well though some gestures don't get picked up great. I ended up disabling all their trackpad software. I definitely don't fault the reviewers for this, but I wanted to let people know that this is not the norm.Software & WindowsThe reviews rightly pointed out the the lack of apps for RT, but the big stuff I use is on the Windows store. More importantly you have access to all your normal apps. This was a big thing for me. I had the original Surface and I loved 8.1 but sometimes I needed an app, like something for FTP or a good code editor, or a good image editor and it wasn't there. With a full version of windows I get the RT apps which work great then I can run a full version of Photoshop, Sublime Text & WinSCP when I need.  In addition you can install Steam and actually play games.Really the ability to run regular Windows apps is what sold me on this. Beyond the free copy of Office you get, you can run basically anything on this. Unlike iOS or Android I'm not limited in my options or limited to a touch screen. If I need to do work, I can do it and then with a swipe bring back ars while hulu is snapped to the side of my screen. Windows 8 just really shines on this machine. You'll get Microsoft's vision if you use this for a few minutes.HardwareThe Atom CPU and Windows 8 keep everything incredibly smooth. As the reviews have mentioned you can bog it down if you do a bunch on your desktop but I was playing games while it streamed a movie from its sd card to my xbox 360. It really packs a punch hardware wise. You won't play the latest titles, even at the lowest res, but if you're like me and travel a bit for work anything can be great. I'm actually looking forward to my next flight as I know I can now play Civ 5 on lower settings.The display isn't great, but it also isn't bad. The colors look nice, and viewing angles are fine. Higher res might be nice but on a 10\" I'm not bothered.The sound is surprisingly good. No, I'm actually blown away by how good the speakers on this machine are. It's just weird. They're loud, clear and actually seem to have a fairly good range. I mean they're not going to compete with your desktop speakers at all but for a tablet they're amazing.The battery life is fantastic. Seriously all day battery with my usage. I was sick the other day and played FTL for about 2 hours, watched some hulu, a movie, then realized I could use Play To with my 360 and watched another movie by streaming it to my tv through my xbox 360 while browsing the web and ended up with about 50% battery after maybe 5 or 6 hours. I did find that it clocks itself down to about 600mhz when you get under 10% and you'll start to see some performance issues then. Really the only issue here is it charges with micro usb so charge times can take a bit.Materials & DesignOk, so now the bad. The keyboard is fine in my opinion. I really love typing on it actually, but it is a little cramped. My biggest peeve though is the right shift key is super small. The trackpad is fine. I'd like it if it were bigger, if it worked better and if they basically transplanted a macbook pro's trackpad, but as far as windows computers go this is fine.The biggest issue is definitely the materials they used. The only word to describe the back of the tablet is cheap. The materials in general aren't great which was the hardest part of moving from a Surface.Final ThoughtsI wish the screen had a glass panel, I wish it was made of aluminum, I wish the keyboard was laid out differently, I wish the trackpad was better, I wish the windows key was hidden away somewhere other then next to the volume button. It would be neat if there were options for keyboard bases with additional storage. I'd love a kickstand on the tablet portion. There are a lot of faults, but the important thing about this is it's amazing.Basically I'd love if Microsoft had made this. If they'd just put an Atom inside the Surface 2 it would have blown everyone's minds. This isn't bad though. Sure if you take it to a coffee shop, people will probably drop money into your laptop bags as they walk past with their iPads and MacBook's. Android users will probably scoff at you for using Windows. But in the end you'll have a great computer that can really do anything except possibly look amazing.In closing, I love my T100.", "Date": "November 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbeatable price / feature purchase", "Author": "Andrew Boulton", "ReviewID": "R1GDJ4D9XGG5PA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "1 week in and i am so happy with this purchase.  Asus nailed it.

I run windows 8 on my laptop at work and don't use the aps at all, but on this touchscreen the aps are great.Keyboard isn't perfect but it works when you need it to (I am currently typing in the dark and it is working fine).I love using without the keyboard as well (tablet mode) it is light, easy to use and plenty big enough.screen is bright, clear and easily viewable.Great running real web pages and NOT stupid mobile versions of everything.  Flash works fine.Between the 7gb of space on Microsoft cloud and the 100gb from asus there is a ton of online storage via the cloud.The micro SD card slot works great too.REALLY REALLY HAPPY WITH THIS PURCHASE.

I like this Asus T100ta tablet a lot. The internet access speed is much faster than my Samsung Galaxy tablet and not slower than my older Intel I3 laptop.Never wanted to touch those old Intel Atom tablets until the new Bay trail Atoms. I am pretty satisfied with ASUS T100's performance. The well-designed detachable keyboard really makes this tablet a laptop or this laptop a tablet. Since there is only one micro USB port on the tablet(keyboard has a standard USB 3 port though) you need a micro USB to female-end USB adapter for regular USB hookups for the stand alone tablet.The battery lasted longer than one day with light use but it charged slowly. Maybe it was caused by the low amperage limitation of micro USB standard(5V at 1.8 amp max). However, I still highly praise ASUS's adaptation of the standard USB instead of the propriety connector. It makes charging easier especially when traveling.**** Warning: When running the MS Office for the first time you have to enter the activation code. The activation code is on an orange pamphlet marked \"Office\", mixed with other booklets. I am glad I did not throw away my never-read little pamphlets!!!PRO: Light and very responsive.

As for the screen resolution--read my full review below. Charging--yeah sure it takes a full 8 hours or more-- I stopped using the brick that comes with it as I have a multi usb 2.1 amp that allows me to plug in my other devices at the end of my day.. the unit is fully charged in the morning so I'm good to go all day and yes, you can go all day. 11 hours for sure. When you do plug in USB for power and use the unit, it will charge but not as fast as you using it so I found if you really know you are going to be needing it for more than 11 hours, plug it in whenever you can to extend that time. For example I used it in my car while using my car as my office for a few hours. I plugged it in to my 12 volt usb adapter while using it. I probably worked 16 hours that day and and had 8% left when I plugged it in at the end of the day. Please read my response to the comment/question at the end for more on how to set it up out of the box.-----------Since the product was first announced I started doing the review watch and finally purchased after the impulse to have the most inexpensive fully functional windows 8.1 tablet and keyboard device was too great.in brief:  Pros:  fast, fast, fast:  as a tablet is very light,  runs full windows o/s if you need a windows machine;  although some say charging is slow, it is done by USB cable so this is a good thing, since you get 11 hours of use, what more do you want?  With the unit plugged in if you are using it, it will not charge completely so expect about 30 hours of use before needing to take a break and let it charge.. if you are working more than 30 hours without a break then you are doing something wrong!  Cons:  keyboard is not quite full size and has arrow keys that cause shift keys to be shifted over;  keyboard/screen mount does not allow screen to tilt far enough back.Now the full review:Let me start by saying I am a tech that has owned and operating my own business for the past 15 years, have worked on all operating system formats from DOS to the latest Win 8.1. My first portable tablet experience was when I bought the Asus R2H Ultra Mobile PC which was about 10 years ahead of its time. I own the Ipad 1, 2, 3, 4  (original ipad mini), Nexus 7 (original and 2013), a Macbook (2008), MacbookPro (2009), iMac (2009), Samsung Chromebook and now this Asus T100. As I mentioned the ASUS Ultra Mobile PC of the past, this new version of the ASUS tablet is probably close to the same build and not at all as some have written, feeling cheap. In fact the tablet side is very solid yet light enough to be able to use it all day long. Also, the keys that are on this device, which are only 3 (a volume up/down and a home/start button on the left and the power button on the top left) are NOT spongy at all as some have written, also stating they are in the place where they are accidentally touched when you adjust the screen, the volume keys I might agree with but certainly not the top power key. I think with any new device there will always be a few issues that take a while to get used to them. In the case of adjusting the screen, use your right hand and you won't be bothered by the possibility of hitting a key accidentally.If I have to focus on the issues that are negative for me, they would have to be the fact that the keyboard is not quite large enough. Although the keys are ok being small, Asus has opted to add the arrow keys which mean the shift keys get 'shifted' and I am finding myself hitting the up arrow key instead of shift almost all the time. Again,this is simply something to get used to but comparing it to the Samsung Chromebook for example, this is a big fail in my opinion as the Chromebook has a full sized keyboard with nice flat keys, similar to the Macbook/pro and other apple keyboards. The other complaint I would have is what some others have mentioned, with regards to the 4 rubber feet on the bottom of the keyboard, which are not all used due to the screen mount creating a raised feature which might be nice, if it allowed for the screen to actually tilt far enough back. I am writing this review from the device sitting on my lap and find myself placing the device between my legs, sitting back in my chair in order to get a comfortable position. When I use this on my standing work station, the screen needs another 10 degree tilt which it simply doesn't have.  The keyboard in my opinion is obviously an after thought where they figured they would build a tablet first, or was built before the screen was completed, otherwise they would have known that the two simply don't mate that great as a laptop.  The actual mating of the screen to the keyboard is very simple, with two locking latches on either side of the connector board in the middle, with a simple push button release that just works. You will want to make sure you hear the click when you push it back on as I have found when I started using this in between the knees position, the keyboard stopped working due to the fact I had not clicked it in place and my knees ended up causing the device to come unlatched. The keys on the keyboard however, are NOT squishy as some have stated and do work quite well. Same as the touchpad. Some have stated it is too small however given the size of the keyboard I feel it is within the correct ratio and works without a problem. I had no troubles getting the unit powered on after about 4 or 5 hours of charge, even though I did try to use it out of the box and then after plugging it in for about 10 minutes.. nada.. tried again after about an hour and still nada.. then started to wonder if I was pressing the correct button, trying the lower side button first and then the top and finally all three together, thinking it might be like a phone where you can reset it this way.. still nothing.. but after about 4 or 5 hours, pressing the power I noticed the screen light up and sure enough the initial windows 8 came up prompting me with the typical username and setup. I was pleasantly surprised that it already had the 8.1 upgrade so I didn't have to go through hours of updates,only 15 critical and about 6 non critical/driver updates.  I didn't get any crapware from McAfey or Norton so that was wonderful. The removal of trialware/malware was very limited. Since I already have an ASUS wireless router I had set up my free 5GB account so I only had to sign in to get my additional storage space, which I probably will not use since I utilize google drive and dropbox mostly, but it is nice to have.Now on to the actual use... the system is FAST... blows away all ipads I own, noting I do have the retina display ipad3 and original ipad mini which has high benchmarks but this quad core bay trail CPU rocks... considering it only has 2 GB of RAM that doesn't appear to be a factor at all. it also helps having the solid state hard drive I am sure.. oh by the way.. about 42gb available out of the box on this 64gb ssd so that is about normal. I have yet to insert an micro sd card in since storage to external usb drive is more likely since I utilize offsite storage like google drive and dropbox anyway.  Using my chromebook about 50 percent of the time I have become quite used to working in online mode all of the time. That being said, i have not used office products for years, since google docs works just fine for me. Although I will open word or excel on occasion, sure, it is nice to have it built in to this machine and for most that do use office, they will find this to be a nice added bonus.The over all weight of this unit with both keyboard and tablet, weighs in a little more than my samsung chromebook but it does feel more solid as well. I must admit after using it with the keyboard attached yet having the touchscreen option, I have on more than one occasion found myself going to touch my macpro or chromebook screen which are NOT touch screens so I can see further touch devices becoming the norm pretty quickly.In conclusion, the reason the 5th star was removed was due to the keyboard issues--the way the entire unit sits on a table with the limited tilt of the screen, as well as the arrow keys causing the rest of the keyboard to have a shift to it, but certainly not a reason to not buy one of these. In fact I can see NO REASON why anyone that wants a VERY PORTABLE device with keyboard, as well as a great tablet option that is very fast AND RUNS WINDOWS wouldn't go for this. I paid $410 after taxes...blows away the Microsoft Surface even if the keyboard isn't full sized.. oh and did I mention the ability to use BLUETOOTH if you didn't want to use the built in keyboard for all day use?  Yes, you can use an apple bluetooth keyboard if you want!", "Date": "December 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Sweet little tablet/notebook setup.", "Author": "Rachel Schroepfer", "ReviewID": "R2GZ2UIP210Z1O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been thinking about buying a tablet for a while but since thanksgiving is coming up and we are traveling I knew I wanted it before christmas. So I read some reviews and talked to some people. Initially I was considering buying a MS surface. I'm a windows girl and always have been so I liked the idea of a tablet that ran Windows 8. But, they are expensive. The pro version, with windows 8 (NOT windows RT) is almost a thousand dollars and considering I have a perfectly good laptop I was not going to spend that much money on just the tablet. Because the keyboard is an additional hundred dollars.I liked at lot of things about this Asus tablet. It ran windows 8, came with a free version of ms office home and student 2013, came with a keyboard, and was cheap. Now windows 8 takes some getting used to. The interface could be a little better in terms of switching programs (I would love to be able to lock programs so they only open in desktop mode for example), but the live tiles are something I'm familiar with already, as I have a windows phone. I do like the simplicity and visual representation of windows 8's start screen. Some people won't. The keyboard also takes some getting used to. It's small, obviously as its only a 10\" tablet. This results in feeling a little cramped. It might not be for people with larger hands, in which case using the tablet's virtual keyboard might be easier as the keys are bigger. The keys do make a satisfying clicking sound, and are textured enough that it's actually easier than you might think to type. I was having some trouble with the touch pad at first, and then I realized that the tab and keyboard weren't fully connected. When you connect the two, make sure you hear TWO clicking sounds. After that everything worked as it was supposed to. Also the touchpad acts as a second tablet screen essentially. So gestures you make on the tablet will correspond to the same gestures you make on the touchpad (for example swiping the touchpad from the left to right pulls up the programs running just like swiping the screen would). Thus the space for the pointer is rather small but you get used to it (and if all else fails you can just tap the screen).Now I bought the 32 gb version at Best Buy for $369 including tax. The only difference is storage space. However, I also bought a micro usb adapter, so I can plug my 1 tb external hd into the tablet and use that as needed (the port on the tablet is micro usb while the port on the keyboard is usb 3.0). I might eventually get a micro sd card but at this point I have more than enough space.On my regular laptop I use photoshop. Beware that Adobe ps cs6 does not support touch screens. On any device.This one uses the new Bay Trail processor and its fast. My laptop is an i3 and the tablet is faster right now. I'm not running as many programs, but it's still impressive. As for design, it's not as well built as the windows surfaces, using plastic instead of metal alloy (of whatever kind it is), but it's not a flimsy kind of plastic, and feels very solid in the hand. The screen does attract fingerprints like crazy, so think about getting a screen protector (I'm getting the skinomi skin for it since I have one on my phone and love it).Overall, for what you are getting, it's a really really good deal. It would be perfect for a student, and is a good introduction into the microsoft 8 os that's not overly expensive. Considering it comes with the keyboard and MS office also, I can't say enough about how awesome it is.If you have any questions about my experience feel free to leave a comment.UPDATE (11/24): I was having trouble starting it after I had shut it down, and also after I restarted after downloading a program. The camera light would stay on which made me think its not shut down. Searched for the issue on google and apparently it has to do with ASUS's webstorage program wanting to be available to update even when shut down. So I deleted it and I don't have the problem anymore. I also got rid of some of the other asus programs since I don't need them anyway. In addition I updated the bios to 216 (which asus took down from their site for some reason but is still available in other places).Also if you don't like the Asus reading mode download a program called f.lux.

I had the same issues as everyone else who found this device problematic.  After going through the setup process, setting up office, and installing other software applications, the T100 became very unstable.  It went into the restart, repair loop and crashed several times.  I was at my wit's end before I read a couple of the reviews that provided a solution to my problems.NOW IT'S MY FAVORITE DEVICE.  Here's how I made it work.After nearly giving up on this device, I read a review that suggested a factory reset would solve all my problems.  I figured, why not.  If that didn't work then I could always return the item.  After I reset the T100, it's become a fantastic device.  Here's how I solved my problems:1.  Go through the set up process.2.  Instead of continuing to load everything else, go to step 3.3.  Go to the charm menu in the Metro Interface4.  Select Change PC Settings (bottom right)5.  Select Update and Recovery6.  Select Recovery7.  Select Remove Everything and Reinstall Windows8.  Make sure you install all the important Windows updatesThe reinstall will seem very slow at first but will speed up afterwards (maybe after 10 - 20 minutes).  After the re-installation process has been completed, you can proceed to continue the set-up process as normal.  You will find that the T100 is now a lot more stable, the touchpad a lot more responsive, and the system seems faster.I don't know this for sure, but I believe the 3rd party anti-virus software will cause some conflicts with the system, so I opted to stick with Windows Defender.  Also, I uninstalled some of the Asus software (reading mode & cloud storage).  I don't know if they caused any of the conflicts, but I did not need them so I thought there was no harm in it.Now, I love this little machine.Pros- Ability to run full Windows 8.1- Decent display- Responsive Keyboard- Very responsive interface- Quick and nimble operating system- Full Version of Microsoft Office- Built-in full USB 3.0 port, HDMI, mini-usb, bluetoothCons-  Initial problems setting up the device-  Problems installing MS Office ( if you run into problems where it's stuck trying to finalize the installation of Office, Google stopping print spooling.  You'll have to restart print spooling after installation is completed)- touch pad is sometimes responsive, sometimes notI hope this review helps others who have problems with this great little device.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Outstanding value for a Windows tablet", "Author": "Lon J.

price point. It comes with the keyboard dock and a full license for Microsoft Office Home and Student edition (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and One Note). Those two items alone would add several hundred dollars to the cost of other tablets.The system has adequate power thanks to a quad core Intel Atom processor. It's not going to be anywhere nearly as powerful as some of the i7 based Ultrabooks out there, but it certainly can keep up with just about any productivity app run on the device. I found it can run tablet games exceptionally well and is capable of running older PC games like Portal and Half Life 2. Newer games will struggle a bit.I am not crazy about the keyboard. The keys are chiclet style and are slightly smaller than the full size keys one might find on some laptops. I also don't like the smaller shift key on the right side of the keyboard.That said Windows 8 is a better computer operating system than a tablet operating system. I've found computing tasks to run exceptionally well on here, but things I use a tablet for (like content consumption) don't function as well as an iPad or Android tablet might. Of course Androids and iPads don't do productivity applications as well as this tablet does.My last gripe is with the 16:9 screen.  It is fine for doing work in its landscape orientation attached to the keyboard but I've found it to be too tall and narrow when placed in portrait orientation.But for those in the market for a Windows tablet that runs real Windows software, this is probably the best one out there at the moment.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Budget Tablet!", "Author": "N. Gates", "ReviewID": "R3F5VS691TU490", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I preordered the Asus Transformer T100TA just an hour after it went up here on Amazon.  I've been following this specific tablet since it was announced and was excited to try it out.  This is the first tablet I've owned but I'll try and give a comprehensive review based on my experiences with it.First off, I'll go over the problems I've had with it.  If I had reviewed this tablet a couple days ago I probably would have given it 2 or 3 stars due to two problems that were occurring.  The first has to do with the volume rocker.  When I pressed down on the volume rocker, it would act as though I were holding it down and reduce the volume down to 0 unless I pressed up on the rocker.  It was a strange issue and I figured I had received a defective unit.  I opened up a case with Asus, just in case there was a simple fix, and low and behold, I was informed to download the latest audio drivers from Asus, and this completely fixed the problem.  The second issue is with sleep mode.  It seems like when the dock is attached and I close the unit like a netbook, it doesn't go into sleep mode and I'll come back half a day later and a huge chunk of the battery life will be gone.  I haven't bothered looking for any windows settings to change this, one might exist.  Now I just use the keyboard hotkey (fn+f2) to put it to sleep before closing it and this seems to work fine.Build quality of the unit is what you'd expect for the price.  I'm not crazy about the glossy plastic back, but at least the pattern is good looking.  The buttons on the tablet portion have a good click to them and I haven't seen any issues with them other than the software issue I described above.  I feel like the dock has a higher build quality as far as materials go than the tablet itself.  Its plastic, but a mat plastic rather than glossy with a brushed metal texture on the inside that I really appreciate.  The connection from the dock to the tablet is solid, the only beef I have with it is it's a little wobbly (I can rock it forward and back a little bit without actually rotating the pivot point of the connection).  The biggest disappointment like many have said is the track pad.  Basically it sucks and I only use it when necessary.  That being said, I hate track pads anyways so even if it was fantastic I probably would be using it anyways.The keyboard on the doc is pretty small, and honestly feels a little awkward.  That being said, if I ignore the awkwardness I end up typing just as fast/efficiently as with a full sized keyboard (I type around 80 wpm on the tablet and my desktop keyboard, which I feel is a pretty average speed).  The keys on the keyboard themselves feel really nice, and overall I love the dock keyboard.The camera/mic are a standard affair imo.  They remind me of the average laptop front facing webcam/speaker.  Not very high quality image/audio, but good enough to video chat.  Just make sure to wear headphones if your chatting if you don't want to get hardcore echoing on the mic.I was really impressed by the speakers on this thing.  I've never put them above 40% as that seems to be good enough to fill up the surrounding area even when I'm sharing audio with someone else.  Definitely better than any laptop speakers I've had the pleasure of using.As far as computing power goes, you probably won't be playing any newer 3d games on this thing.  I do a little bit of game development as a hobby in my spare time and even some of the simple games I make run pretty slow on this guy.  That said, 2d games seem to run smoothly on it and I was even able to get Portal 1 to work at a playable frame rate.  I'm mostly using this guy for some media consumption and some light programming on the go though, so it's perfect for my uses.  All the Apps on it run really smoothly and the only hangups I've had are with the metro internet explorer app freezing, which I'm hoping is software issue rather than a hardware one and will be fixed (it feels weird using IE after so many years, but honestly IE 9 is pretty slick in metro and even has a little bit of WebGL support, so they seem to be trying to catch up).Overall I'm very satisfied with this product, and if you want a budget windows 8 tablet, I would recommend this guy 100%.", "Date": "November 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great purchase for our family.", "Author": "Christina", "ReviewID": "R1WAMX6TA12NYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This convertible laptop is exactly what the description says.  It does take a little getting use to with the new windows on it but I'm starting to really like it.  I love that it came with a keyboard and Microsoft office, two big items on my list of must haves. Out of the box it looked impressive.  I was a little disappointed there wasn't an instruction manual or even a quick start guide but there is one under apps and online it just took me a while to find it.The screen detaches from the keypad really easily but is really sturdy when it is attached.  The keypad is small and takes some getting use to for typing a lot but again, I'm getting use to it.My only complaint is the camera.  It takes pretty horrible pictures and there isn't a back lens so if you are trying to take  a picture you have to hold it at a weird angle.  I didn't get this for a camera  though so I didn't knock off any stars for that.  The screen quality is great!  Images and pictures online are really clear and vibrant.Oh and the battery really does last all day.  It takes a while to charge so we just leave it charging overnight.  By morning we are at 100%, use it constantly between the four of us and it makes it until evening before needing charged again.", "Date": "November 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect For My Purposes", "Author": "Makeever \"mackeever\"", "ReviewID": "RAYC0UZ4OOFRS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been wanting a Windows 8 tablet to free me up from my desktop computer, and after reading reviews (and having an Asus Transformer TF-201 that I like a lot) decided to go with this. I didn't care one way or the other about the keyboard, and have only used it enough to say that it's working fine. So far, the only problems I've had with the tablet were caused by user error; even with years of Windows experience, I found there to be a fairly steep learning curve. (Where's this? Where's that? Why are there three different versions of it in three different places?) Fortunately, I was able to find answers for my questions on line.One warning: do not calibrate your tablet, you'll lose your charms bar.For me, this was a super wise investment, learning curve and all.", "Date": "November 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent Tablet!", "Author": "Veiran", "ReviewID": "RRE74M1V36Q21", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As close to what I want in a tablet/laptop as I can currently see on the market.The only two things that would make this tablet/laptop better is ~11in screen size and greater than 1080p screen resolution. Still enjoying it immensely, though!I've connected a mouse via the wireless bluetooth connection, so this circumvents the rather poor trackpad, IMO. A good workaround I would recommend for those looking to use desktop/mouse-based functionality.My intention is to test how using an external hard drive for gaming works out. Utilizing the USB 3.0 port should allow this, so games that aren't too recent (mostly Steam games from before 2009) are what I'll fiddle around with. If this solution works, it'll eliminate the need for additional storage in the machine itself; this will leave my 32GB version with plenty of room for essentially only tablet specific apps.Getting back to the tablet itself: this largely addresses the small gripes I had with the Vivotab Smart. The sound is much improved from the one mono speaker to the dual stereo speakers. The inclusion of the Bay Trail Z3740 Atom in this T100 stomps the floor with the Clover Trail Z2760 Atom in the Vivotab Smart. Display is largely the same. The only thing that lacks by comparison is the case (which isn't a big deal for me); T100 is glossy compared to the quality feel of the Vivotab Smart. Overall, a great improvement!So, depending on how the workarounds for the internal storage work out, this may be my tablet/laptop of choice for the next year to several years. (-:Update1: Using a WD My Passport Ultra 500GB USB 3.0 External Hard Drive, I tried Counter-Strike (original) and Torchlight 2; both worked successfully. Will try Diablo III soon after it downloads.Update2: Success, albeit with reduced visuals. Game is definitely in a playable state. :) I was also able to get Portal 2 to play well on the external HD; awesomeness. An excellent solution for PC gaming on the go as well as having a simple tablet when you need it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Update3: Encountered what I believe to be a Bluetooth battery drain bug. I was able to reproduce it reliably a few times now, so I think I can positively say how to get around it.That is to say, if you want to reproduce it, you'll need a Bluetooth device (I got my Bluetooth mouse). Make sure it's connected to the tablet. Then, simply put the tablet into sleep mode (close the lid or tap the power button). After that you can wait for the Bluetooth device to time off or turn it off yourself.Instead of sipping power at less than 1% per hour like normal, it's more like 10-20% per hour in this state. I imagine this is caused by how Windows 8 engages sleep mode with peripherals attached. An easy workaround is for you to turn off your Bluetooth device before you place the tablet into sleep mode.Rather annoying to deal with but doesn't affect my opinion of this device; still a fantastic product!", "Date": "November 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great tablet, plus more... It replaced my iPad.", "Author": "slb", "ReviewID": "R18U2SZ0S7051J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, let me say that I have been checking out the MS Surface and the Dell Venue 11 Pro i5 prior to purchasing the Asus T100TA-C1.  The Surface is nice in the hand and has some great specifications, but was a lot higher than I wanted to pay for a tablet.  The Dell Venue 11 Pro i5 was also nice, but I could not get past the sound of the fan whirling off and on.  Both the Surface and Venue are nice models if you are looking for the higher processing power that the i5 chips would require, but the price and weight are significantly more than the Asus T100 series.I had purchased the Dell and used it for approximately a week before finally getting Dell to agree to let e return it (the Customer Service Department and the process handling purchase and returns was quite lengthy).  As far as the Surface, I had only played with ones in stores and one at work that belonged to a coworker.Additionally, the Asus was purchased to replace my 3rd Gen iPad.On to my review of the Asus:Right out of the box the Asus T100 has been fantastic.  The T100 is a perfect sized tablet, very comparable to my wife's iPad Air.  Setting up the Windows tile screen was fairly intuitive and the learning curve has been easy even though this was the first that I had used Windows 8.Physical attributes of the Asus T100-C1:PROS:-Nice size and light weight.-Plastic shell, with a clear coat but does not feel cheap in the hand.-Touch screen is very nice and responsive. So far, all of my input gestures have been spot on.-Screen and display is very bright and colors look great.  Compared to my wife's iPad Air, the screen looks the same.  -Movie playback looks good using the Netflix App.-Button layout is good as the volume rocker is off to the side, the sleep/power button is on the top so as to not get bumped.-Micro SDXC slot!!!  I put a 64GB U1-speed micro SD-card in and have all of my iTunes library on the SD card versus the onboard memory.-USB 3.0!!!  I will soon load up all of my daughter's videos (which is extensive) and put them onto a small form-factor USB thumb drive for when we are travelling.-Keyboard is a pleasure to use, even though the size is obviously smaller than a standard laptop keyboard, I have had zero issues typing or navigating around the smaller space.  The docking of the table onto the keyboard is solid and clicks snuggly into a cupped partition on the backside of the keyboard. There is a release button at the front of the cupped dock partition that release the tablet and with a slight pull, it easily comes free (versus just falling away from the keyboard).CONS:-Keyboard: smaller than a standard laptop; more like a netbook.  I have had zero issues working on the smaller keyboard, but I wanted to highlight it for those that were expecting it to be comparable with your laptop-sized keyboard.-Plastic shell: The clear coat is a finger print magnet.  I purchased a protective skin from Amazon in order add a layer of protection from scrape and scratches anyway, so no finger print issues anymore.-Micro USB power connection:  The micro-USB power cord sticks straight out from the side of the tablet and looked liable to getting hit so I ordered a right-angle micro-USB to standard-USB cord from Amazon for $5.99 and now the cord barely sticks out before pointing down.-I wish the keyboard had an additional USB 3.0 portAsus/Windows Software:PROS:-Full Windows!!!-Full free version of Windows Office Home!!! I can now surf the web, watch Netflix, load iTunes, and work on actual Word, Excel, and PowerPoint documents without having to use a couple of expensive purchase apps that I have on my iPad that don't always work correctly when received from my coworkers through DropBox.-Real Adobe-The Tile screen is easy to customize and use.-You can have 2 tasks up on the screen at the same time and adjust how much of the screen for each (music and internet, MS Word and FaceBook, whatever)-The swiping of tasks is great; just swipe from the left side of the screen or mouse pad, and you will scroll between tasks.-The tablet software is very interactive in that if you swipe from the right, a menu bar pops out from the right with options related to the task you are working on and general options; swipe from the bottom and a menu bar pops up with file options related to what you are currently doing.  Overall, very easy to be interactive with whatever you are working on.Software CONS:I haven't come across any yet, but my expectations are that of a tablet to fall somewhere between my high-end laptop and my iPad.Overall I am very pleased with my Asus purchase.  I have added the 64GB U1-speed micro SDXC card, a Bluetooth mouse, both tablet and keyboard skins (faux wood skins look surprisingly great), and the right angle micro-USB to standard-USB cord.  I have been using exclusively the Asus for about 10 days and have not used either my iPad nor my laptop during that time.  Unless something unexpected happens from here on out, a 6 year old is soon going to be inheriting an iPad 3rd Gen from her daddy.I hope this review helps in your purchasing decision.Asus/Window 8", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Best Windows 8 convertible hands down - ignore touchpad and balance concerns", "Author": "anonymous", "ReviewID": "R3MOZ63M97LSE7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've waited to get a Windows 8 computer until I found something worth the pain of re-learning windows and this is it.  When I heard the specs on this computer I was pretty excited - touchscreen, removable tablet, 11 hr battery life, 2 pounds, real keyboard included, and under $400.  I read some poor reviews about the touchpad and the thing falling over, but those reports are overblown or false.  In the end, I love this thing so much I plan on selling my MacBook Air original & iPad original - this replaces them both.Pros:- Low cost ($300 with 64GB on Black Friday)- Very long battery life.- Runs real Windows 8 - not just the \"Metro\" apps from the app store- Thin & light - fits everywhere and easy to carry- Good keyboard (although some find it too small)- Excellent touch screen- Very easy (one button) to detach fully functional Windows 8 tablet- On an airplane you can use it all the time because it's under 2 lbs.  If they hassle you, you can just use the tablet until you reach cruising altitude.- Display very good.  It's not as high resolution as the new Surface but I don't ever see a problem.  The pixels would be too small for most adults' eyes to be usable at full resolution.Cons:- No separate PgUp/PgDn, but Fn+up/Fn+Dn works.- micro USB power connector feels like it would be very bad if pulled the wrong way.  Apple magnetic connectors are nice!- Windows 8 is nice with the tablet, but it's still schizophrenic between Metro & Windows, and not as easy as an iPad (eg pinch Zoom isn't always available esp in regular Windows).- There aren't yet many dedicated cases.  People are trying all sorts of alternative cases without finding a perfect fit.The touchpad isn't the world's best but it doesn't feel too cheap to me and more importantly, it works fine.  People are complaining about the feel & sound of clicking on the lower left/right but you don't need to do that at all - just tap anywhere to click.The other concern I've seen is about the balance of the LCD vs keyboard and it falling over.  I don't understand this.  I've never had it fall over.  Now, I have seen a video about a guy who disassembles the keyboard and removes the metal plate there to reduce the weight by a huge amount.  That setup probably is top heavy.  The stock T100 never falls back.I've also seen on the TransformerForums.com concerns about power issues - not going to sleep, waking up when closed and draining the battery, etc.  I haven't seen those problems personally, but it seems that these may be related to a bad version of the BIOS which is user upgradeable.  If you are seeing problems, you should update.  If you aren't seeing problems then don't.The only problem I've found is that I can't change the power buttons or lid to Hibernate instead of sleep.  It doesn't matter much with such long battery life, but it still uses .5%-2% per hour while sleeping, and the startup is so quick I prefer to Hibernate.  I eventually installed \"Start8\" which gives you the old start button back including Hibernate.I've read about WiFi disconnecting, and I've had some problems, but I think my problem is actually with my networks because I've seen it happen side-by-side with another Win7 laptop.I can't see why someone would want a Surface 2 for $450 which won't run real Windows desktop programs, or pay twice that for a Surface Pro 2 which won't do anything more than this.  This laptop rocks.  It's the device I grab when I want to quickly surf the web or check email.  It's also what I grab when I want to watch TV and do some real work.

incorporates the best from the laptop and tablet division of Windows and at a price that is, quite frankly, a steal.  And, for less than $350!***This is the first Windows computer I've owned in more than 20 years.  Incidentally, this comes just one week after I bought my stepson a Toshiba Satellite notebook (and being greatly impressed with its performance, as well.)There are a number of things that jumps out at you when working with this laptop hybrid:* Compact features. This is should be in the category of \"sub\" notebooks.  This is about the same size as my old, Contaq \"Contura Aero.\"  Measuring 7\" x 10.5\".  And, it weighs about 2 lbs.The notebook-tablet is a hybrid but it's a fully-functioning Windows laptop that you can access by the detachable keyboard or by a 5-point touch screen.*** App's Store ***The Windows App store has an impressive library of app's--more than triple from last year, although well behind the iTunes Store and the Google Play/ Android app stores.*** Spec's ***32GB SSD HDD3GB DDR2Quad-core \"Bay Trail\" processor @ 1.3Ghz10.1\" screen with 1366 x 768 resolutionMicrosoft Office 2013 H&S;10+ hours of charge.  (I've only re-charged it once in 3 weeks.)Bluetooth 4.0Only $399*** Performance ***More than anything else, I'm wonderfully surprised at how well this laptop works.  It's always been opinion that a Windows PC's only makes sense from a budgetary standpoint.  But, this hybrid is extremely useful (and this is coming from a diehard Apple fanatic) for operations more than word processing.The first thing you'll immediately notice is that the laptop powers on from push power to fully operational in 5 seconds.  5 seconds!  The SSD drive is incredibly fast, much faster than I anticipated.This also translates to word processing app's to browsing the internet to playing games.The keyboard is close-cropped but it wasn't so cramped like the Compaq I used to own that I find myself hitting the Shift Key when I wanted to hit the Comma key.Working with art app's like Sketchbook Pro was what I was most interested in finding out.  It works flawlessly via a stylus and when a Wacom Bamboo tablet is attached, it also gives me options.Netflix and other necessary app's are another plus because with more than 10 hours of battery life, I can work or play without needing to have an ac outlet nearby.I'd also like to mention that this hybrid is connected to a power source by a micro usb to usb connection, so you have the option to plug into another computer to charge, an external battery or if you have a usb-ac adapter, you can plug it right into the wall.*** Price vs. Value ***The retail price is $400.  I've seen it as low as $350.  But, you have the best of what's offer for a \"better\" laptop at $800.+ Super fast SSD drive+ 10-hour battery life+ Touchscreen or keyboard+ Windows 8.1 (and you can get rid of that gaudy Metro screen)+ Lightweight and compact.+ Hybrid computer gives you access to both traditional Windows app's and touchscreen app's simultaneously.+ For a budget price--it is a MUCH better option than a similar hybrid (from other manufacturers) and budget laptops.If there's a downside, it may be for people who want a optical drive, it would have to be purchased separately.This is an absolutely great laptop/tablet where you're not sacrificing performance, portability or versatility if you prefer one style of computer over the other.", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Perfect Tablet/Laptop", "Author": "J. Liles", "ReviewID": "R270XDX2N0QMJZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's why this is a better tablet/laptop than the other ones out there, in no particular order:1. Low price without sacrifice.2. Office is included, and it's not just a 60 day or one year license. It's forever.3. A keyboard is included free of charge. The Surface 2 keyboard will cost you $130 extra, plus you don't get the desktop version of windows with the standard Surface 2 which costs the same as the Asus Transformer Book T100.4. You get the desktop version of Windows. This means you can install applications from websites. You aren't restricted to apps from the Windows Store. This is a humongous selling point.5. 64GB hard drive space. Not 32. 64. Plus there's a Micro SD port. Grab a 64GB card from Amazon for $40 and double your storage. Micro SD cards are absolutely tiny and amazing technology.6. A USB 3.0 port on the left side of the keyboard. Plug in to use a wireless mouse.7. Detachable screen/tablet. It won't turn off when you detach it.8. Battery life is phenomenal. Charge all the way before powering on the first time. You can do it. Just go get a drink or something.9. Headphone jack. Yeah, all tablets have this. But just listing it as a feature. The speakers on this tablet are actually quite good too without much distortion at high volume levels.10. Mini HDMI port.11. It's not too small. The screen is a great size. And the keyboard... I am very tall and have large hands and fingers. I'm typing this review and making very few mistakes that require me to backspace. In fact, I typed point #11 without having to backspace once.12. No camera on the back reduces the price. You aren't going to be taking pictures with such a large tablet anyway since it makes you look a bit weird, so great thinking by Asus on only including a front camera for the occasional Skyping, something I really don't even do that much of.13. Asus is a solid brand with many years of experience. If you haven't heard of them, don't think of them as a weird brand. They are professionals. They specialize in the techiest of techy stuff. Ask that friend that helps fix your computer. He'll confirm.I may be forgetting other things. Any drawbacks are stomped on by all the things I mentioned above. They're all minor. Note that I am a verified Amazon purchaser and not someone from Asus trying to get the review score up. There's no need for that with this product anyway, as it's perfect.This is my first tablet ever, and my first laptop in eight years. I'm highly satisfied.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Would I buy it again? Absolutely!", "Author": "C. Couch", "ReviewID": "R28XM2CHYDBKOK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A great value.  I have been waiting for a Windows tablet that isn't huge in foot print (think 13 inches, no one wants to carry that) but still gives a full experience and it has been delivered.  It is important to remember what this will provide.  If you are expecting a $1500 windows computer experience you will be disappointed.The good:this is solidly built, the dock and hinge feel sturdy to my hands.  The keys have a nice report and feel nice under finger. The screen is good not the best, but for 350 what did you expect?  The touch screen is very responsive and works great for up to 5 points of contact as advertised.  The machine has a good amount of pep.  These Atom processors are getting pretty serviceable, heck I can play Left for dead 2 on it without any issue at all. The Intel video graphics have come a long way since I last bought a PC with Intel graphics inside. Battery life really is 11 hours or more.The Bad:My first unit got swapped by my local retailer because of a defect (it stopped booting to windows 2 days after purchase and the bios stopped seeing the hard drive as a viable boot option), but the second has been running strong for a few days now.  The second unit had some performance issues and an inspection to the throttling of the CPU for power management reveled it simply wouldn't go faster than .750 GHZ.  Having had a unit that performed much better, I elected to factory restore like another reviewer suggested.  This has worked and the CPU will now hit 1.88 ghz (depending on usage) as it should.  My suggestion give it test drive for a few hours before you fully configure it to your liking, if it isn't surprisingly snappy for an Atom then you should format it. (For the techno phobes its not too hard to do. Swipe from the right, hit the search icon (magnifying glass), type remove, and 3 or 4 down you should see \"remove everything and re-install windows\". From there follow the prompts.)Dislike:The touch pad.  Asus really could have done a lot better here.  It's functional sure, but its mushy feel and lack of distinct left right buttons leave me with a bad taste in my mouth.  Sensitivity there is fine, but I prefer my Logitech travel mouse by a long shot. unlike on my Lenovo work laptop where the travel mouses propensity for hand cramps has me preferring Lenovo's touch pad. With its 11 hour battery life I didn't expect to use it plugged in so much, but I find I'm always looking for power plugs because it takes 6-8 hours to charge it to full.  Maybe I'll break this habit and get over the mental block that 30% power still means I have hours to go, but given the short life of all my other electronics at 30% this will be hard to do.Would I buy it again? Absolutely!I even recommend you do too, just accept that you will want a cheap travel mouse for when you are creating content and that you will use the touchscreen for everything else.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "It Would Be Perfect With a Few Tweaks", "Author": "B. Cole \"bcole\"", "ReviewID": "R15R0YJA73VAEU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This laptop/tablet combo is good, but it could be a lot better with just a few tweaks.The Software:There were a few instances where the drivers that Asus was downloading were interfering with the Microsoft drivers and caused the system to crash pretty bad. I was able to get it back up and running after doing a full restore.The system at first would not take my Microsoft account.Music will not play in the background on desktop apps, but will on Modern/Metro apps, but that's not Asus's fault, it's how Microsoft designed the operating system for the tablet.Other than that, I really love the metro interface and how well the laptop holds up.There is almost no lag on any of the programs that I have launched. I am impressed with how well this laptop can handle what I throw at it.Having Office with this laptop is a very nice feature, and it has a big price tag on its own.The hardware:The speakers are the best I've seen on a tablet to date. I was impressed as it did better than all the laptops I've ever owned. This is something that Asus really has down very well.The screen is nice and is very responsive to the touch.The power had issues at the beginning, but after a system restore I was able to get the correct drivers for it.The charging is slow, but it's about the same speed as I've seen for Android tablets. I didn't expect it to go that fast with a Micro USB port.The keyboard dock is good, and the tablet will fit in every time. It gives a Windows sound when it's connected. Has a USB 3.0 port.The keyboard isn't lit up and I wish there was an option for a backlit keyboard, as I would buy one.The keyboard is also a little cramped, but it was what I expected with the size of the screen.Also wish the keyboard had a battery like previous Asus Transformers.Battery life is about nine hours for me, but I'm a heavy user. I recommend charging it while you sleep.I just needed something small that can run Windows. This fit the bill for me as it has Office included.

The screen is adequate and responsive. The computer itself is really fast. Boot times are fast as well as shutdowns. I am not a big gamer but I played some market place games and they run fine. Most likely, games that are designed for desktop would have some delay. However, the tablet runs all applications including office without any problems. Video, including HD, runs very smoothly on the device as well. Battery life of the device is as promised or may be even better. I was able to run the device for whole day, about 14 hours total on and off use, without charging and still had 20% left. I watched a few HD movies, browsed the Internet on and off, spend a few hours on my homework, and played a few games. This is exactly what I need out of any tablet.Of course, what makes it all happen is Windows 8.1, and it is a very good improvement over version 8. I like the changes they made and SkyDrive integration is very welcomed. On the other note, I do like reading mode application provided by Asus. I did uninstall all other Asus apps.However, there are few things that I don't like about this machine. Windows button is strangely positioned on the side by the volume rocker. There is usual windows logo on the bottom of the device but it does not do anything. I might have gotten a defective device but that is how it functions. I am still planning to look into it. Enabling hard drive encryption made the computer to stop working and I had to reinstall everything. I need to ask Microsoft about that.There are options of what you can buy instead of this device. You can go for Surface 2 or upcoming Nokia 2520. Surface has a nice screen but I don't like Win RT and Surface is slower, much slower. I was able to play with T100 and Surface 2 at a store and there was noticeable difference to how faster T100 is. Nokia 2520 has faster processor than Surface but it is yet to be seen. However still a mobile processor with Win RT. Of course, money is the issue. Surface 2 is $450 with 32GB of HD and no keyboard. It would cost close to $600 or even more to get similar configuration to T100, and all it would provide is higher screen resolution, but still slower performance. On the other hand, Nokia 2520 will offer LTE connectivity and that might be important, but any laptop/tablet can connect to the internet without extra fees by sharing phone connection. Nokia 2520 will have a really nice screen, but at supposedly $500 it will only offer 32 GB of HD and no keyboard. That is why it will cost around $600-$650 to get similar configuration to what T100 offers for $400. All it will provide is LTE connectivity, much nicer screen, nice design and perhaps similar performance, but still Win RT. Next in line is Dell Venue 11. It looks very promising and might be a really good choice. The price was just lowered to $500 for the base configuration that will offer 64 GB of HD and faster processor than T100. In addition it will include full HD screen.  However, it appears that the device is promised to have 8-10 hours of battery life and, with my previous Dell experience, we are looking at about 7.5 hours. However, I might be wrong. This tablet looks like a good choice at slightly higher price where you are looking to spend about $150-$200 to get similar configuration to T100 but better specs. The is one problem that stopped me from Dell Venue 11 is the size. I find 11\" form factor a bit uncomfortable and Dell weights 1.6 lbs vs. 1.2 for Asus. Dell Venue 8 looks good too but 8\" is kind of small for my needs, but a really good option for a tablet. I am sure many more are coming and may prove to be even better choices but T100 is a good tablet with good options at an attractive price point.It is important to note that T100 is the lightest as the tablet out of presented choices, except for Venue 8.", "Date": "November 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for the money with some caveats", "Author": "M. Yu", "ReviewID": "R7S2GZSSFI4QZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The idea of having a Windows 8 convertible with 10+ hours of battery life with Office 2013 included for $400 seemed like a bad infomercial promise, but it turned out to be true for my purposes.  I was looking for a second computer that could do fairly basic Windows stuff and multimedia while also being very compact and having a long battery life.I had previously purchased an Atom-based Asus netbook that was atrociously slow and only lasted a few hours, plus the fan was annoyingly loud.Here are my findings:GOOD:- The T100 is as fast as you need a second computer to be.  MS Office runs smoothly, all videos play well and it's never slowed down terribly so far.  I haven't run any processor-intensive stuff yet like Photoshop or Crisis, but that's not why I purchased it.- The screen is rather nice.  It's an IPS WXGA screen, which pales in comparison to some 1080p phones, but for a 10.2\" netbook, it works well.  Text is readable and videos look great.  The brightness isn't spectacular and the reflectivity is high, but it's very crisp and the viewing angles are excellent.- There are no fans.  It runs cool.  It runs silent.- The speakers are better than my 17\" laptop.  Not great in the bass department, but they're loud.  I just wish they were facing forward instead of backward.- It's super light and compact.  I'm able to read holding just the screen and the whole package, including the keyboard, fits nicely into the Kensington tablet sling I just purchased.- The construction is solid.  Yes, the lid and screen are smudge-prone, but it's all solid state and thoughtfully arranged...for a $400 piece of hardware.BAD:- The WiFi is a bit wonky.  When I wake my computer, sometimes the WiFi won't work but when I just turn the laptop's WiFi antenna off and on, everything goes back to normal.- The charger is as slow as people are reporting.  Sometimes it charges fairly slowly, other times, not at all.  Still working that out.- The trackpad is annoying and unpredictable.  Once I turned off the tap-to-click feature, it was much more manageable except the trackpad clicks are conspicuously loud.  Remedied by a bluetooth mouse.OTHER THOUGHTS:- I appreciate the microSD slot.  I put in a 64GB chip and it works great.- Some have complained about the single-antenna WiFi, but it hasn't bothered me at all.  Streaming music and video is not a problem.- The tablet doesn't fit in immediately so you kind of have to wiggle it in so it will fit flush with the keyboard.- Windows 8.1 presents a learning curve.  It's also not the greatest OS for a tablet computer.  But once you get used to the quirks, it's not a dealbreaker.- The keyboard is small but totally usable.  With its weird layout and lack of backlighting, it's not great in the dark, but otherwise, it's fine.IN SUM:For me, this computer does everything I expect it to do.  It's tiny, relatively fast and the battery life is tops.  That said, there are many idiosyncrasies that you must contend with.  WiFi, keyboard and charging require some fiddling, but maybe those things will be ironed out in future updates.All in all, it's a great piece of hardware.  If you're looking for something that has the portability of a tablet but the functionality of a laptop for $400, it's an amazing deal that can't be beat.

The keyboard and tablet integrate so well, mechanically and electronically, that you wouldn't know this is a tablet plus keyboard when they're connected.  The keyboard is small and cramped, as you can imagine, but works very well given its size constraint -- solid touch and construction. But the keyboard comes in really handy for both keeping the tablet screen standing up for hands-free viewing as well as banging out text on the keyboard when it's more convenient than using the touchscreen.  The touchpad works very well, it also has built-in left/right mouse buttons that also work well.  Windows 8 is a completely different experience from previous versions.  It is all about touchscreen tablets/computers and works well for that.  You will have to get used to finding things on the computer in a new way and this will annoy many.  But the positive tradeoff is an iPad-like experience.  Apps install and update seamlessly.  The tablet alone is very light, and the screen is both bright and very sharp.  The battery charges quickly - 2 Amp charger.  And one other thing, this tablet and keyboard will cost you hundreds of dollars less than competing products with similar features.

In terms of speed and performance with regards to gaming and video, this convertible has met all of my expectations.  I'd just mirror the positive reviews from others.I got past the Microsoft Office installation issues - I wouldn't worry about the concerns other reviewers have had.  The workaround is pretty minor.  By stopping the print spooler and setting it to manual, Office installed great the first time.The one concern I have, I believe matches other reviewers comments about their tablet not waking up.  I've occasionally had this problem, and I believe I've narrowed it down to the tablet not waking up from sleep when connected to power.  If disconnected, I can leave the laptop on sleep mode all day without issue - the screen will immediately light up ready to work within a second.Unfortunately - if I left my laptop charging during the day, when I return - I'll only get a black screen.  I can get the laptop to power cycle by holding the power button for over 20 seconds, but this is frustrating.  I'm also concerned that eventually - the laptop may refuse to power back up.  I hope Asus or someone else comes up with a fix quick - because otherwise I'm considering a return.If this were settled - I'd have no problem rating this 5 stars.

I currently use a Windows 8 Phone, a Windows 8.1 Desktop, and this.  Everything works together.  I have every App I could hope for and see absolutely no reason to get a more expensive iPad or Galaxy Tablet over these. (Caveat: If I wanted to read books in the sunlight, or really cared about high resolution for movie playback, or needed specific apps that aren't yet on Windows, mostly games, i'd say there is a reason to get one of the android/apple tablets).

Shame, as this had so much promise.Back to the original review.....Asus is really measuring up to be a great laptop. I've been a fan since the motherboard days, and am really starting to like them over Toshiba, as my go-to laptop brand. I have an ASUS A55VD-AH71, and am quite impressed with it, because its got a lot of punch, and is one of the few economical laptops out there that still has a physical graphics card.  This Transformer Book can't hold a match to that, but for a budget tablet/laptop, it's pretty amazing. Unfortunately, it's got a lot of hiccups too.Is it a Tablet or a Laptop?BOTH! That's the coolest thing about this little guy -- it's a full-fledged touch-screen laptop, that detaches from the keyboard to transform into a tablet! Cool to say the least.  The footprint is basically 10.25\" x 6.75\" and about .75\" thick with the keyboard attached.  To detach and use in tablet mode, just push the lock button on the keyboard and remove the screen -- voila - instant tablet.  The screen reattaches quite easily and locks into place, so I can literally pick up the whole thing by the screen if I want, and the 2 parts stay securely attached.  The build feels rock solid; it doesn't feel like it'll break apart accidentally, and the 2 parts lock together and feel like one solid unit when attached. Very nice.Welcome to Windows 8 in it's Natural HabitatLike most people, I wasn't all that fond of Windows 8 when I first tried it.  It's not that the OS is bad or anything, it's just a big departure from the Windows we used to know.  Plus, Windows 8 was designed to be touched, so unless you're using it on a touchscreen laptop, then it's just cumbersome and awkward.  I ended up tweaking Win 8 on my main Asus laptop to run more like Win 7, and I'm much happier with it that way on that particular computer (non-touchscreen.)  But on this Transformer Book, Windows 8 is kinda dreamy.  I'm really falling in love with it within this context -- on a touchscreen device, where it was made to shine.  Windows 8 was meant to be swiped and touched, not clicked to death with a mouse or touch-pad.  Frankly, Microsoft shot themselves in the foot with that one -- a touchscreen device should have been mandatory for Windows 8, and that OS should NEVER be installed on a non-touchscreen device. It's just not meant to be used that way.  My opinion of Win 8 has improved 100-fold, now that I finally see it in action, the way it was meant to be used -- all touchy-feely.Fingerprint MagnetCosmetically, this Transformer Book is very attractive; sleek, chic and modern. The downside though, is it attracts fingerprints like crazy. The high gloss lid is beautiful, so long as you never touch it. But the minute you lay fingers on it, it shows every smear and smudge, and quickly looks like crap.  The touchscreen is no better. I have a new Kindle HDX, and I don't know what Amazon did to that thing, but no matter how many times I poke and touch it, I'm hard pressed to find any fingerprints on the thing. I mean, I really have to try hard to make a single smudge or smear.  This Transformer, conversely, could pick up fingerprints from an imaginary friend. The screen on my friend's iPad always looks like that too, and I never want to touch it because of that. I turn into Howie Mandel in that moment, inspecting every smear and smudge, imagining these touchscreens to be breeding grounds for every virus and staph infection known to man.  Not a very attractive feature of this otherwise beautiful laptop. I'm constantly wiping this thing down, even after just a few minutes use; it's just that bad.The Netbook ReinventedRemember those little netbooks that were virtually useless for anything but checking email? Well, that's what this reminds me of, only this time, it's actually useful.  This is a full-fledged Windows experience here, not a glorified email device.  So in that regard, you can do anything on this Transformer Book that you can do on a regular laptop.  Well, almost. It has no disk drive, so you're limited to downloadable software only. No one's gonna load Adobe's Production Suite onto this thing. But a cloud version of Photoshop might be interesting.Cloud Based SoftwareClearly that's the direction we're all headed.  Microsoft Office has already gone there, and the OS is soon to follow.  In the not too distant future, software piracy will become near obsolete, since everything will be based in the cloud; including our own documents. But the upside to that, is it should cut down on viruses, piracy and the dreaded system wipe and re-install that we've all had to suffer through on occasion.Microsoft Office IncludedEverything except Publisher, from what I can tell.  Comes with a 1 user license product key in the box.USB Recovery Disk?This comes with a USB flash drive in the box. It's very nice and chic looking, but I can't get any of my computers to recognize or read it.  I'm assuming it's a recovery disk in case the computer ever crashes.Don't Be FooledYour standard Android or Apple tablet is very easy to use.  Nary a software update or any real knowledge required.  This Transformer Book is great, since you get the best of both worlds -- tablet and laptop. But just don't become complacent, thinking you're using a run of the mill tablet. It's not. This is a full-fledged windows PC that can be used like a tablet.  But it's still Windows in all it's glory -- and with all it's security concerns too.  Be sure to install a good anti-virus or security suite, and keep it updated.  Don't fool yourself into believing you're using an innocent little tablet.  I like having the full throttle power of a Windows machine in tablet form, I just gotta remind myself to remember that it's a full Windows experience, and not just a glorified toy, like other tabs.The Hiccup List:Nice as this laptop is, there are some serious hiccups that make it feel more like a work in progress, than a fully realized idea. Here they are:> Wonky Power Button - Sometimes, I just can't get it to power this darn thing on! Or off! I just keep pressing and pressing, and nothing. Then suddenly, it works. I don't think it's broken or anything, just really finicky with how it likes to be pressed. Not a deal breaker, just a pain in the arse.> Near System Failure on Updates - as is always the case with Windows, there's a crap load of updates required right outta the gate. Asus even has a few of their own.  Problem is, once all the updates were done, it naturally wanted to reboot -- and it almost never turned back on! I almost thought I was gonna have to call tech support, because it looked like the thing had flat out died. It got stuck on a black screen for half an hour and wouldn't reboot. So I had to repeatedly futz with that wonky power button and forced about half a dozen reboots, which was a real pain, to say the least.  After several glitchy reboots and jittery screens, it did finally sputter back to life. Not sure what the issue was, but it seems to be working fine now.> Crappy Charging Port - it's got a micro USB charging port, and a nice compact charger. Only problem is, I really have to futz with it just to insert the charging cord.  It really doesn't go in very easily at all and is a real pain to work with. Huge design flaw IMO.Bottom Line - this is a fantastic little laptop, hiccups and all. I mean, I wouldn't use this as my one and only computer. But as a portable solution, this is about as good as I imagined something like this could be. LOVE how it easily transforms from a laptop to a tablet. LOVE Windows 8 in this touchscreen environment.  And LOVE the combination of portability and power.  This is the future of tablets and laptops right here, and both Android and iOS have something to be seriously worried about.  The Goliath is back in the room, and it's called Microsoft.  And now with touchscreen laptops creeping into the market, they're in prime position to keep their grasp on the market.  As far as the hiccups, I'm sure Asus will fix them over time, but for now, it's not a totally problem free experience.  Overall, this is a solid little laptop, and minus the glitches, it works as good as my budget Toshiba Win 7 i3 laptop. This is ideal for a life on the go; be it travel, work or fun.  I'm very impressed with this little guy, and excited to see where this is all going.

Moving most of the files wasn't that big of a deal, fortunately, but it was an added annoyance initially.The on board mousepad is extremely jumpy - it is constantly jumping, even in mid click, to the far outreaches of the screen, usually the bottom left corner where your taskbar is by default - which means you're in the middle of clicking something and all of a sudden files start opening up instead, or you get swapped to the Windows 8 screen randomly because the icon gets clicked instead of the button on the webpage  over which you were hovering when you actually clicked on it.The connection to the internet is a bit weird - I'm listing this last because I'm still unable to figure out if this is an issues with the Unit or something my internet's side. Frequently when I return home with this computer, it register's the WiFi, but insists that I have the wrong product key (even though I can see it and know that the passcode is correct). It will do this for several minutes and refuse to connect to the internet, then all of a sudden it will be fine and just hook up. I know some others have had hook-up issues as well, which is part of the reason that I'm unsure if it's the computer or my WiFi. Either way, time seems to fix the issue.So those are my only complaints: Watch your storage (default is Tablet even when docked), flukey mousepad, occasionally malcontent internet connectionEven with those 3 items, I'm highly satisfied and very pleased with my purchase. This system has been great. Solid, durable. Perfect for my uses both at home and on the run. League of Legends runs fine. It Streams like a champ.

Having read the reviews both good and bad I knew I needed to let it fully charge. I unpacked the tablet, charger & cord plugged it in but did not turn it on. I meanwhile went to my other computer and went to the ASUS web site. I downloaded all the drivers on their site for this device and stored them on a micro sd card. Once that was done I popped the card into the charging device and didn't touch it again until I woke up in the morning. Then I held my breath and turned the thing on to find out what would happen. It booted up fine though like all initial Windows set ups for a new machine/install it took a bit. I answered all the questions and waited while Windows Update did its' thing. 19 updates later and two reboots later I checked to see if the apps I wanted to run worked the way I liked. Once I was satisfied that everything was working ok I entered the activation code for the Microsoft Home Office & Student 2013 software. I hooked up my Canon all in one printer without any issues.

The only glitch I have encountered is that when I go to Zynga.com I can't play Farmville 2. I can play CoasterVille but not Farmville 2. I enjoy both games so I'll keep plugging at that issue & update this review if I manage to resolve it! So far (after only a few short hours of fiddling) I really like this little thing! I had an iPad for several years & it never lived up to what I wanted to do with it but then ever since my Dad introduced me to our first IBM PC XT back in 1988 with its 8 megabytes hard drive & 5 inch floppies my favorite thing to do with a PC has always been the word processor. I was never ever able to happily pound away at a word processor on my iPad and easily transfer the resulting files between devices. Pages just lacked too much to be useful & getting a file I was working on on and off the iPad was a nightmare. I love all the cloud storage this device comes with. If this thing conks out on me at a future point I'll definitely let you know but so far its great! I highly recommend to anyone who is comfortable working with Windows software.UPDATE: After doing some digging I've learned that Farmville 2 is hopeless with Windows 8.1. It is a Zynga issue not an issue unique to this device. I can play Coasterville without issue so I will wait for the Zynga fix for Farmville 2.I've managed to drain the battery completely without using it so I will make more of an effort to do the shut down process when I won't be using it for several hours.Overall I still like it.", "Date": "December 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fabulous device..Laplet.", "Author": "LG", "ReviewID": "R1RDBU1XYQHI0I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing device.

I've called ASUS 3 times regarding the status of the RMA return and am having troubles getting an answer as to when the laptop will be returned. I even tried the ASUS online RMA inquiry form, but it can't find my RMA return. If you have this problem I would try to send it back to Amazon for a replacement vs. attempting to have ASUS fix it.

I asked them if they installed the Windows 8.1 Update that locked up the computer and he informed me they just re-installed the factory Windows OS configuration without the additional update. I asked him what I was supposed to do when the Windows update rolled out and locked up the computer again. He said it would not happen again. As a web developer I was skeptical. On Dec 10th the ASUS laptop performed the Windows update and again WILL NOT boot into the Windows OS; I only get the ASUS logo on the screen. I performed a \"system restore\" to reset the laptop back to the Dec 6th configuration and it is still locked up. This is either an issue with the ASUS T100 tablet itself or the Windows 8.1 OS.I am considering downloading a Windows 8.1 ISO and installing my own version of the Windows OS without the ASUS version of the Windows OS.

The other machine I was looking at was the Dell Venue 11 Pro, but in the end it would be twice as expensive for the Atom model with keyboard dock & stylus, and I didn't think I needed an active stylus that badly.I'm impressed by this generation's Atom processor, everything was very snappy when navigating Windows 8.1. I was able to compile and run Game Maker Studio projects about as quickly as on my i7 laptop (they're for mobile&web; platforms, but still).

I have now order two of the Asus Transformer books with windows 8.1.  Both of them have been defective and unable to turn on.  I purchased this product because of the high reviews.  I am sure most of those who received this product and were actually able to turn it on are pleased.I was very excited when I received my first unit.  I carefully removed it from it's packaging and followed the very simple instructions on how to start the Transformer book up for the first time.  The instructions recommend waiting at least 8 hours before using in battery mode.  This was okay as I had it plugged in and wasn't going out any time soon, I just wanted to get the initial setup complete.  However, the only reaction from the device was an orange blinking light.  There was no response from the power button.  Turns out after calling Asus, the orange blinking light is a battery malfunction indicator and the product would have to be sent in for repairs.  I promptly returned it to amazon and had a replacement shipped.Within two days the new Asus Transformer Book had arrived.  Once again I could hardly contain my excitement.  The device looks and feels great, and I couldn't wait to use it!!  Once again I followed the instructions which are very simple. (plug device into keyboard, plug power cord into adapter, plug power cord into tablet, plug into power outlet, turn on)  This time the light remained solid orange!!!  The device was successfully charging and in no time I would begin the initial setup.  I let it charge for a few minutes before attempting to turn it on.  As I pressed the power button I heard a small click.  The next thing I know the power button is recessed into the tablet, and doesn't pop back out and the orange charging light turns off.  The power button was stuck, and the Asus transformer book, much like the first unit I received, is now an expensive paper weight.I was devastated.  I called Asus, and was told the only thing they could do is have me send it to them for repairs, but I should expect to wait for 3 weeks or so.  I am beginning to grow impatient and do not want to wait that long.  I once again file with Amazon for replacement, only this time Amazon is out of stock.I still want the device!!!  I really do, the third time is supposed to be the charm.  I even purchased a nice case for it. However, I want it for the original price I paid for it at $350.00 for the 64 GB unit.  Now it is upwards of $400, and not shipped through Amazon.  I will try to contact Amazon to check if there is anything they can do.Overall I am extremely disappointed with my experience so far, but am willing to give it one more shot.  At $350, if this device can actually do what it says, then the Asus Transformer Book is an amazing deal.

Computershopper.com had given this ASUS Transformer Book T100 a stellar rating, and it seemed to have everything I could want - preinstalled Office, convertibility to a tablet, minimal bloatware, attractive price... surely those people complaining about it just got the few lemons, or were the type to whine about anything.After 4 days with this computer, I am sending it back to Amazon and taking the hit of shipping cost. By the second day of trying to get this machine to work, I sounded like an abused spouse justifying its poor behavior - \"I can fix it if I try harder\", \"once it's installed everything it won't break down again\", \"I shouldn't have pushed it so hard by installing that program\", \"hardly any computers nowadays work well right out of the box\", \"when it does work it's a lot of fun\", etc. I've finally come to my senses and stopped with the excuses.Now, some of the things it failed to do correctly:1) start up (at least 3 times, it tried to install \"updates\" - for what, I don't know - shouldn't it have gotten everything on the first round of updates? Again, it had been 4 days of use! - and it knocked itself out. At those points, it took up to 20 attempts of restarting to get it going, and all the while it was offering to fix the problem through deleting all added files & programs. I can't imagine having to upload my documents over and over on a daily or weekly basis.)2) shut down (sometimes it ignored all attempts to turn it off, including the brute-force hitting of the power button.)3) read externally-linked devices (it completely failed to recognize my Kindle when I hooked them together by USB. I went out and bought a new cord from the Microsoft store - \"maybe it just needs a USB 3 adaptor instead of my old USB 2\" - and that got me to the point where it would recognize the Kindle for ~2 minutes, then conk out.)4) recognize touch-screen commands (sometimes it liked the hand, and sometimes it liked the stylus, but sometimes it didn't like anything.)5) recognize keyboard commands (again, sometimes the mouse and pointer keys were acceptable, and other times they were not.)This is the first truly negative review I have written for Amazon, as far as I recall, and it has nothing to do with Amazon's end of the deal. This particular computer is simply not functional. I desperately needed a new laptop, as I am going on a business trip in less than 2 weeks, and my current computer is old and cannot handle wireless anymore. Now, because of the time crunch, I have ordered a Dell to be express-shipped from Best Buy, so that I can have it for a day or two before the trip and get everything onto it.I made the mistake of pooh-poohing the negative reviews, because the price was so attractive and because I gave too much weight to the positive reviews. Now I have to look at it this way: if I can't turn on the computer, what good is the free Office suite that it came with, which I can't access?

I notice EVERYTHING.So let's start with ...THE BAD:It's no surprise that at this price-point, there would be some minor defects. I ended up returning one (maybe two ... not gonna lie) before I was satisfied. The first one had a \"pimple\" formed in the plastic casing of the tablet, which is fine ... it's cosmetic. But then I attached the dock and the trackpad was doing all sorts of crazy things that I could not fix, regardless of the settings, so I sent it back. I was not sure about a windows tablet anyway ... I am really an Apple person. A few weeks later, Amazon offered it $30 cheaper! This enticed me to try it again. It arrived with no blemish on the casing and no trackpad issues. HOWEVER, there is a noticeable light bleed that appears near the right bracket where the docking station connects. I believe this to be a design flaw, but it's not really that annoying, unless it's going to distract you while watching a movie in the dark with the black bars on top and bottom. I confirmed this by viewing another unit, which exhibited the exact same screen irregularity. Other negatives include:- I'm having difficulty getting the micro SD card reader to read my class 10 card and it seems this is a shared experience. It only likes certain card manufacturers so do your research.- It's a fingerprint MAGNET, so keep a microfiber cloth handy- Get a case, because the polished plastic casing on this scratches like no one's business- As reviews have stated, the screen is not the best (obviously, from what I said about the light bleed that comes standard with each), but I feel that it does the job JUST FINE. It's clear and pleasant to view. Could the contrast be better? Yes. Could it be brighter for better viewing in bright areas and less glare? Yes. Are you going to absolutely hate it? No ... it's no retina display, but it's much sharper than the display on the first iPad Mini or 1st gen iPad. You are not going to find a 10 inch tablet at this price-point. Would you rather a great processor with a good screen? Or a second-rate processor with a super 1080P screen at a higher price-point? Pick your battles, bargain shoppers.THE GOOD:- This. Thing. Is. FAST! So smooth switching through menus and such a pleasure to navigate.- FULL WINDOWS 8.1!!! I love the versatility of being able to use the new interface, while also being able to go back to the windows we are all familiar with.- Microsoft Office!!! You get the full office programs that you need for school: MS Word, MS Excel, and MS PowerPoint. What a great value for someone getting this for their student or just the average user. And recently, I started using OneNote and it is a TOTAL JOY with this tablet. I hold it like a clipboard and write my notes during management meetings. Everyone asks me what I'm using. It's so effortless. I love it. It transfers through the cloud to my office computer so I can share the meeting notes with my staff. The tablet is excellent for this purpose.- Accurate touch response on what I understand is Gorilla Glass (so it's scratch resistant as well)- Dock - I don't know know why some reviewers state the dock is cheap and uncomfortable to use. I find that it feels solid, responsive, and easy to type (and I'm actually a typist). My hands are also above average size.- The screen is still considered HD - it's not 1080P, but it is 720P and even with the slightly annoying light bleed, none of the three units I \"tested\" (we'll go with that) had a single dead or stuck pixel. That's saying A LOT. I have seen MUCH MORE expensive tablets plagued with dead pixel issues and/or dust trapped under the screen. Props to ASUS for that!Why buy this?You're a student on a budget (perfect) -OR- you're a guy like me who wanted a cheaper 10\" tablet that was great for FULL ON, unrestricted web browsing (remember that Android and Apple don't do flash). That was my intention initially, but what I GOT was more than I anticipated. I use it for taking notes during meetings at work, for some light gaming, and I use the BING apps constantly to read news, etc. (check out the health app with the 3d human body - it's awesome).Despite some minor improvements that could be made, you cannot go wrong with this as an entry-level Windows tablet.

The idea of the transformer took care of that, so I decided to branch out and give it a shot.- GENERAL: I spend a lot of time uploading/editing photos, and this computer just isn't practical for that. With only the 2GB memory, just adding 40 pictures temporarily to my downloads folder between editing and transferring to my flash drive slows the computer down to the point that I can't even edit the pictures (I use online editing software, so that's not what's slowing it down).- GENERAL: I'm someone who keeps everything stored on a flash drive, and I've also never been a fan of the laptop mouse, so I always have a traditional USB mouse plugged in. With this computer, I can't have the mouse and flash drive plugged in at the same time since there is only 1 USB port, which makes editing photos and saving anything to the flash drive that much harder.- GENERAL: I really don't see the point in having a touch screen when it's being used in the form of a laptop (with the keyboard connected). Probably my favorite feature is the ability to go back and forth between tablet/laptop form, and the touch screen does respond well. However, it is almost too big to be used as a tablet in my opinion. It is heavy and hard to hold with one hand.- GENERAL: Because of the small size of the computer itself, I find it hard to type on the keyboard. Some of the keys are in different places than what I'm used to, and it's hard to type using the \"home row\" keys if that's what you're used to. It can be done, but not without looking at the keyboard while you type or doing a lot of deleting.- CON: I'm sure this can be switched out with another cord, but the USB charger cord it comes with is WAY too short. My outlet and the arm of my couch is only an end table's distance apart and the cord barely reaches.- PRO: Battery life does seem to last about 8 hours.- PRO: This thing has AMAZING sound quality and speakers!I decided to return it to Best Buy after a little more than a week, for a few reasons. 1) It just wasn't practical for what I need a computer for. 2) I was having a LOT of issues getting it to turn on and off- pushing the power button and nothing would happen. It took several tries to get it to turn on. That was frustrating enough for me not to want to deal with it- that's not what I paid $350 for.Overall, based on the reviews (which is part of the reason I chose to buy this computer to begin with) and the guys at Best Buy backing them up (they were surprised to see it getting returned, but agreed that the powering on/off issue was probably a defect), I would still recommend this computer if it is not your ONLY/MAIN computer. I can see it being nice for travel and it is very convenient to have around in terms of how portable it is. It was also a good music source. I just don't think it's very practical for everyday use, even for people like me who use their laptop for simple things like surfing the web and Facebook.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great machine at a great price.

It is VERY difficult to use left and right click without moving the mouse at the same time.  I have written to ASUS about the touch pad and the reply was - that is the design.  The touch pad design makes this machine far more difficult to use in keyboard mode than any other of the many laptops I have experienced.  If ASUS would fix the dumb design of the touch pad, this 2 in 1 would indeed be a great machine.  I reduced my rating from 4 to 3 stars.  It would be 5 stars with a good touch pad.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Great 10\" machine, fantastic at the Amazon price - mine was $349.  I don't understand why some of the reviewers have negative comments about Window' s 8/8.1 - this reviews the PC not Windows.  I have been using this PC for a few days.  It has completely replaced a 10\" NoteBook, an iPad 1 and a Kindle Keyboard.  This PC does all those functions really well.I won't repeat the comments many others have made.  I am really happy with this purchase.  Two features need improvement.  The right shift key is difficult for me - I am a hunt and peck typist, and I frequently mistakenly hit the Enter key.  The touch pad is hard to use for me.  The mouse moves when the click area is touched.  It is really hard to position the mouse on a small target and keep it there while I click.  Using a Logitech mouse works very well.  I disabled most of the Asus Smart Gesture options.  The touch screen works very well, much better than the iPad 1 I was using.  I prefer a stylus over my fingers.  Having almost every action available as a touch or as a click is really flexible.Bottom line - a wonderful, small, portable, multi-purpose device.

The big requirement was that it be the full version of windows 8, not the RT. As I looked, I researched a bit on the new Bay Trail processors that are found in these tablets. From the reviews I read, they seemed to be a fairly good option for the casual user. I must confess, I was very hesitant to buy this tablet at first because I was worried about having a slow processor. I had just upgraded my processor in my desktop purely because of my dissatisfaction with a slower processer(which was still more than enough for what I normally do with it). I just like to have the newest and the best. Anyways, as I looked around, I realized that at the price point I was looking, there were really only three viable competitors depending on the price I could get. My options narrowed down to the Asus T100, the HP Omni 10, and the Dell Venue 11. Both the HP and Dell had a slightly faster processor, along with the 1080p screens. However, unlike the T100, neither came with the keyboard dock and both were a little more expensive.I had originally discounted the importance of the keyboard dock. After all, how could it be any good at this price point? In the end, I sold my previous laptop, a bulky machine and decided to turn around and buy a laptop. A couple things made me bite the bullet and choose the T100. First, the processor was only one step below the other two, I figured id be fine considering i'm only using it for school. Also, my laptop had the same resolution as this tablet, and it was fine on a 15.6\" screen, so I figured that being so much smaller, I really didn't stand to gain much going for the higher resolution. When I sat down to buy the tablet, I was going to get the 64 gb version and get a micro sd card for it at 64 gb as well. Well, during the checkout process, I realized that for 15 dollars more, I could sacrifice some internal storage down to a 32 gb, but get a 500 gb hard drive built in to the hard drive. That seemed like a steal, so I decided to pull the trigger and just get it. With four dollar overnight shipping(finally FedEx got it to me when I asked for it), I was ready to use it the next day. I plugged it in like it asked and got impatient, so I started the set up while it was plugged in so as to avoid the problems I read about from not charging. Turns out I had 100% battery within 30 minutes. surprising. lol. The first thing I noticed setting it up is the build quality. Everything uses a plastic, however, it all feels sturdy. I have no flex in the keyboard, and the Chiclet keys are easy to type on. I am writing this review on the keyboard a day or two after I got it. I will admit, the shift key is a little small, but otherwise Im almost used to it already. It isn't that hard to type on. The trackpad I feel could use a little work, but for its size and what I was expecting, im fairly impressed. There is the initial lag when you have to turn it on again, but that is minimal and you get used to it.Once the tablet was actually set up, I have used it for everything. The screen quality is great! With it on my lap, I notice no pixels or anything and everything is very crisp and clear with great colors and is very satisfying to use. Its clear and really doesn't take away from any of the experience. With the Bay Trail processor, I rarely get hung up on anything. It handles everything ive thrown at it. In the last hour and 20 minutes, ive been surfing the web and writing papers on Microsoft word, and ive used about 17% battery so far. Plenty for a full school day. Im also listening to my music collection from the 500 gb hard drive, and going into a stats class with SPSS(statistics program) installed and ready to go. Also, some random guy just said it looks cool and asked to hold it to see how light it is, literally while I was writing this paragraph. Im pretty much a celebrity now. Anyways, its awesome.

I wanted one because #1 they are light and #2 they transform into a tablet.  I actually downgraded from a pretty heavy duty laptop as I wanted something that would be much easier to travel with.  This fit the bill perfectly.  I got the 64GB solid state drive version and at this price, it'd be hard to do any better, especially considering the fact that with a micro SD card, you can double the HD space for around $50.  I would also recommend picking up an external HD and a USB hub.  This is due to the fact that the base only has a single USB port.  I actually picked up a mouse as well.  After adding these things, I've got the perfect tablet for on the go and the perfect laptop for when I'm home working.  Total damage including laptop was around $480.  It'll be less if you have some of the things mentioned above, but I'd definitely recommend having them as they really increase the T100's attributes.I've hard that some people have issues with the keyboard, I haven't noticed anything wrong with the setup and I consider myself to have relatively large hands with something I call dumb finger syndrome.  A couple of my personal minor complaints are that the shift key is a bit small, it takes a minute to get used to hitting the right shift key as it's a bit out of place and smaller than a normal keyboard...obviously.  Also, the microphone in this thing is absolutely terrible.  Once again, not an issue as I just bought a pair of SkullCandy for like $20 which included a mic and this fixed the problem.  It didn't matter as I needed something for when I was in public anyways, but it should be noted that almost everybody has issues with the mic on this thing.  But at the price point, you can't have it all.  The mic with the SkullCandy actually makes Skype calls really crystal clear and much better than on my previous laptop.I've noticed that the WiFi is actually much more stable with whatever this thing has to connect to it.  I have no idea why, but my old laptop would constantly connect and disconnect and this one never does.  I was surprised at how much I like the Windows' windows (I have no idea what to call the tiles on the tablet).  They're really easy to use and make it so I can just glance at it and know if I have any emails, missed calls, FB posts, LinkedIn whatevers, etc.  I'm reminded of that commercial where the guy with the Windows phone is skydiving and quickly checks his phone for his updates.  It really is like that and I actually prefer the setup to the iPad.Overall, I've been able to run everything I need to, including Adobe PS and Premiere, as long as I save the files to my external hard drive.  I also tested it with Fallout 3, works reasonably well after twenty minutes of play, though I've hard that it can get bad towards the end of the game due to the scale of the Fallout world.  Not bad though, considering I'm playing on a $400 tablet.  Camera works well for Skype and charging really isn't an issue for me.  Office software is smooth as is YouTube video.  I actually don't even keep that much music or video on my computer anyways as I like to stream video with Amazon Prime and listen to music with Spotify.  Really isn't an issue unless I'm somewhere that doesn't have WiFi (aka poor people places).  I usually don't bring my tablet to those types of places anyways.  I'm actually quite surprised at the power of the ATOM (sp?) processor as it really seems to be better than the previous generations.You don't really need to let it charge for 8 hours, you just have to keep it plugged in until it's fully charged the first time.  You can start it up right away as long as you keep it plugged in.  I'll post again if something goes horribly wrong with it, but so far so good.  I really couldn't be happier with this thing and it really seems like it was built to last.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Broadcom driver problems, great tablet", "Author": "Lazarus rising", "ReviewID": "R2RLWA9Q9XK1U1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I need to lead with the negative. With my T100 the Broadcom wireless drivers that Windows update suggested I update to through Windows update Borked the tablet. It took me awhile to figure out that they were the problem as there were a fair number of other updates. In the end it took 7 restores, one refresh and lots of sleuthing (about 8hrs in total) to determine that it was the update to the Broadcom wireless drivers that kept destroying the windows install. The touch screen would lose operability, I'd get BSoD on reboot and sometimes it would just lock-up completely. I was able to restore each time, but after I left the drivers alone with no update, it has been working PERFECTLY since then. So my suggestion is, do NOT attempt to update the Broadcom wireless drivers THROUGH WINDOWS UPDATE.I say that because today I ran in to another Broadcom driver issue. The wireless adapter comes defaulted to 20mhz/65mbps mode. I enabled 40mhz/150mbps mode. It would keep losing an effective network connection after 3-5 minutes. After checking, Asus has newer Broadcom drivers on their website. I downloaded it and had to manually select the driver (no install package for them). The installed driver has a signed date of October, the Asus website says that the drivers on their site I think are November signed, after manually updating Windows claims that the drivers are older and from September (despite what Asus website claims). HOWEVER, the wireless adapter now works in 40mhz/150mbps mode without dropping the connection every few minutes (requiring a restart). Weirdly the network status claims it is only connected at 24mbps (I've verified 150Mbps connection speeds as SMB transfers from my file server chug along between 6-8.5MB/sec, about 67Mbps on the high end, compared to 3-5.5MB/sec in 20Mhz/65Mbps mode).So the wireless in the tablet is bonkers. I think I blame mostly Broadcom on this one, but Asus should have also done better validation of the hardware they were installing in these tablets. Mine is a fairly early one, Warehouse deal from around 11/25, so it is probably some of the earliest hardware. It could be Asus changed to a different revision of the same Broadcom wireless adapter, or maybe better quality control.Either way, BEWARE when you are setting it up for the first time.So the negative out of the way. After getting the wireless issues fixed, it has been problem free and working GREAT. Yes, it is only a 768p screen, but the quality is rather good. Decent viewing angles, decent saturation, bright enough and I don't notice significant glare (I'd rate it roughly on par, glare wise, as my iPad 2, but overall better DPI, almost as good viewing angles, better contrast and maybe slightly better saturation).The atom processor in the tablet is overall pretty snappy and I don't find any real issues with the eMMC in the tablet for speed. The card slot seems limited to around 20-25MB/sec only, sadly, but it may be worth getting a fast micro SD card for it anyway, as you have better small file transfer performance, even if you can't get all of the sequential speed goodness (I got a 32GB Sandisk Extreme to go with the tablet on sale from Amazon. It hits ~80MB/sec reads and 55MB/sec writes through my desktop's USB 3.0 reader, but only around 25MB/sec read and writes in the T100, but small file performance is pretty close between the my USB3.0 card reader and the internal T100 card slot).The dock is pretty good. I have average sized hands for a man 6'1\", so bigger than average for most men. I don't have any real problems typing on it. Sure, it is small, its a 10.1\" tablet dock. I wouldn't want to write a 20 page paper on it, but I can manage at least 80% of my typing speed that I can on my 14\" laptop or desktop's full sized keyboard. The key travel is nice, it isn't a loud keyboard. The trackpad is nicer than I was lead to believe. No, it isn't great, yes it is small. I don't really have any issues with it losing track and it generally registers clicks (90+% of the time).Overall, for the price the T100 is awesome. Sadly stock of it seems low right now with few having it, especially the 64GB model. I can't help wondering what Asus could have done with another $100 on the price tag. z3770 processor, 900 or 1080p screen and 3/4GB of RAM? Maybe slightly better build quality and better/faster wireless?Maybe next year.At any rate, the T100 is well worth its price.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Something Different for me...and it's growing on me.", "Author": "pho35", "ReviewID": "R3TZZAGUZV6YTP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like this device enough that it prompted me to write a review for my fellow shoppers to make an informed decision.I'm not going to go over the pros and cons as other reviewers are already posted, so have it at.  What I'm going to share is my frustrated experience, but yet rewarding in the end.So I'm on my 3rd (yeah you heard me right, 3rd) tablet now and why you ask?Well, the trouble began when I bought the initial one.  It was the first edition of the production version which as firmware 212.  It has its own issues as widely reported on the internet.  I went then to Asus site and found a 214 version that promised to fix some issues.  I went and download the firmware and using Winflash to update; this is where the frustration comes.Within winflash, I kept receiving the \"Cannot allocate buffer\" error upon flashing.  I later found out that there is another flashing utility within the BIOS itself called Easy Flash.  Well off I went to download the bios to the USB drive and load it up into Easy Flash within the bios.  Flash went fine, but the device never power on after that, it is now in the COMPLETE BRICKED state.  OK, so I went online searching and some others reported bricking with same approach.  I ended upFurther research, I read some guidelines on how to \"proper\" flash using Easy Flash utility.  One of them was using FAT32 USB stick.  Fine, with the 2nd unit (I exchanged in at the local store), I carefully formatted as suggested, and same result was a BRICK using Easy Flash.  OK so fast-forward to the 3rd one...this time I really evaluated my options and finally got it to flash using Winflash which in turns in calls Easy Flash.The reason it worked because I skipped enabling Wifi and just signed in with local account.  Then I removed the SDCard (which I previously had it inserted while flashing using Easy Flash) this time around and went smooth to 220.After all of that, I now have a great tablet/netbook at hand which I used to replace my dead Nexus 7.So lesson learned: Remove all the everything that is not needed to ensure and refresh to factory state before trying to flash.", "Date": "December 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for daily use", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R9PWH6NQL2MDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent device - compact, lightweight, easy to use and very simple to dock/undock from the keyboard.

Just plug it in and leave it plugged in while you setup the computer for the first time. The power cord is short so you'll have to sit very close to the power outlet. Buying a USB extension cable is a good idea.It connected to my 5Ghz wireless network perfectly.It's a little fingerprint prone, but still very sexy and sleek. The tablet screen locks very securely into the keyboard dock and it's easy to unlock it from the keyboard dock too.I'm a power user so I only bought this hybrid netbook for portability reasons. It will be great for traveling when I only need access to the internet and other light tasks. It comes with a Product Key for Office 2013 home/student version, so that's nice.The battery doesn't charge very fast, but it does have a long battery life once it is charged. It took maybe about 6 hours to charge to 100% battery and it last about 6-11 hours on battery depending on whether you're playing an intensive game or just browsing the web.The touchpad is average. It needs to be a little more sensitive. I went into the control panel and played with the mouse settings, but that only helped a tiny bit. However, I will be using this with a USB mouse most of the time, so its ok. Because the touchpad isn't great I ended up using the touchscreen to maneuver around and the keyboard for typing. It has a touchscreen keyboard as well. My USB mouse worked great.The keyboard keys are perfectly responsive. It's a small keyboard though, so the larger your hands are the more cramped you are going to feel. However, I got used to it very quickly and stopped missing keys.The touchscreen is really responsive and precise about knowing which small area of the screen you touched on a tiny menu.This tablet has a full version of Windows 8.1 32-bit. So you can install any desktop program you want.The only programs installed when you first boot are the typical windows stuff, Office 2013, and some Asus programs which are actually useful instead of bloatware. The only thing I uninstalled was Asus WebStorage. I don't need that.It's very quick for a tablet PC, probably because of the SSD. Not recommended for heavy tasks, but still powerful at multi-tasking lots of lighter tasks. It's got an Intel Atom CPU with 4 cores. I was able to play games like Runescape and WoW on Low Detail without lag.There's a microUSB port, a microHDMI port, microSD card slot, and an earphone jack on the side of the tablet screen. There is a full-sized USB3.0 port on the side of the keyboard dock. A microphone and webcam are built-in to the tablet. I've tested them using Skype and they work fine.Just browsing the web, the tablet barely gave off any heat whatsoever.You do not want to work on this netbook for long hours. It's too small for lengthy work. You'd get a backache and an eyestrain. As a tablet, it's perfect for reading in bed for long hours.Buy an ethernet USB adapter if you want to plug an ethernet cord into it instead of using wifi.I'm surprised by the powerful speakers on such a small netbook. They're awesome for music and video.I'm very impressed by this tablet. Despite it's low price, it doesn't feel cheap at all. I'd actually recommend it over the much more expensive Microsoft Surface Pro 2.

That is the kind of portable computer that I was hoping for for a while.Pros:- Lightweight.  The keyboard is made heavier deliberately to balance the tablet.  Detach the keyboard, an it's half the weight.- Relatively powerful.  I have a browser open and work in MS Office comfortably with no lag.  Even basic photo editors are snappy.- Multitasking is excellent.  I really believe Windows 8 was made for such a device.  Run metro in tablet mode, run desktop when working with the keyboard.  Split screen is a marvelous feature and all works perfectly with a quad-core processor.- Dual band WiFi.  I live in an apartment building and can simultaneously see about 20 separate SSIDs.  Dual band to the rescue.- IPS panel - viewing angles on the monitor are excellent.  I'm wondering why a $1,000 laptop would have a TN panel and a $300 tablet would have an IPS?  You'll enjoy it.  Also, the first unit I tried from BestBuy was a B1 model - I returned it due to networking issues.  This one is C1 and it seems to me that the unit is better color calibrated than a B1.  Just my opinion.Cons:- Keyboard is just meh.  I don't mind it, but my hands are small. Someone with bigger hands would feel constricted.- Trackpad is ok, but the trackpad buttons are just bad.  You need to click close to the button separator to get a reliable click.- Only 1366x768 resolution.  Not a deal-breaker, but my son's Lenovo Miix 2 (yep, he snagged one of pre-release ones from Amazon) has a full HD screen with not much of a noticeable hit to the performance. EDIT: Miix 2 doesn't have full HD. Still low res compared to other tablets on the market, most notably Nexus 7 2013.  I'll take full Windows at lower resolution over Android with higher resolution.Other thoughts:- I had a weird issue that my router (ASUS N66U) would not work normally with this tablet ONLY.  I needed to restore router to its factory settings to get the full speed.  After re-inputting all of my custom settings in the router it still works fine.  Just a quirk.- To those who ask \"But can it run Crysis?\" the answer is YES! My son and I did it for giggles.  60 FPS at medium settings.

Many of the first generations were so wide they were a little awkward. This size feels right on. it is easy to hold and not very heavy. One minor complaint is that the speakers are on the back and I feel like the sound might get a little muffled when I hold it. Minor complaint, though.When docked, it is very usable, though the keyboard is cramped. I can certainly get some work done, but I am not breaking any typing speed records with this thing. The trackpad is ok. I heard some complaints about this and at the suggestion of another person, I disabled most of the smart gestures (Asus application) and it seems to work well enough. It is a little small, but does the job. Warning...the button presses are obnoxious...very loud. I think someone accurately described it as sounding like that bubble think in the Trouble board game. It has bluetooth though so if I need to do anything significant I use a wireless mouse.Office is an added bonus. I am in graduate school and I was trying to use Open Office, but I cant stand it. This might work for others, but everyone else I my school group is using Office and I use that at work so the learning curve and minor conversion issues were driving me crazy. The fact that Office was included is awesome.Performance with Bay Trail is also good...better than I expected. The other Atom processors were tolerable I guess, but barely so. This processor is noticeable faster and seems more than adequate for email, browsing, watching video and productivity tasks.Screen...I saw some say brightness wasnt that good, but I find that it is plenty good enough for indoor use.Battery life is great. Close to my iPad...for what you get, that really is awesome. And it has to be, because charging takes A LONG TIME. and I mean it. To be honest, I am thinking it would take days unless this thing is turned off. I am not sure why that is. In order to make sure that this has a full charge it is like I have to shut it down and give it at least 4 hours. Would have rather seen another option that microUSB for that. I can certainly work around it, but it is a little annoying.Windows 8.1...I don't share the same Windows 8 hate that everyone has. There was a little bit of a learning curve, but I appreciate what Microsoft is trying to do. I think that Windows 8.1 is a good improvement over Windows 8.I paid 329.00 for this and I think it is a great deal. As mentioned, I do not think it is really a leader in any single area.

I bought this little powerhouse, as a backup for my wife\u2019s laptop computer. She loves it. It does everything she likes to do on her laptop (surfing, e-mail, word processing etc.) and it is a lot more portable. She has had it now for about 3 months. As others have stated I too had problems when I first received this computer, especially during the initial set-up process. I was ready to take it back to the store for an exchange but decided to do some research on the internet about it first. I must say I am glad that I did that. I believe that ASUS was in such a hurry to get this new item out before Christmas that they lacked on the quality control. It was a gamble, but judging from the worldwide sales I guess it is paying off. I mean, what more could you ask for, this thing is a Laptop a Tablet and a Kindle. Once you update this computer correctly your problems will slowly go away. Here are some tips.1. Attach tablet to keyboard (listening for two faint clicks to make sure it is attached) and fully charge computer before any attempt to use it.2. Leave computer plugged in while going through the set-up process.3. During set-up when asked to go online skip that step and go back to it later.4. Once that process is done go in and set windows updates to check for updates but only install at your choosing.5. Now you can set up the computer to go online.  Find Asus Live Update Utility already installed on your computer and check for updates.6. You will probably see a list of updates that are needed, install the BIOS one first (the latest as of this review is 226) and then the others one at a time following any instructions that goes along with them.7. Go to PC settings and do a full recovery/ restore of Windows not refresh that only resets Windows while keeping your files intact. You want to put it back to factory settings. Think of it like tightening up a screw that came loose during transit.8. Go back to Asus Live Update to make sure the updates you installed are still okay. You will know if you keep clicking to check and nothing shows up. Bios is most important the rest you can put in later.9. Now go to Windows Update and install all updates one at a time.These are just some of the things I did to get this computer running well. Hopefully it can help others. It may seem like a lot of work but, this computer is well worth it. Keep in mind that Asus is always sending down updates through the Live Update Utility to address problems and improve performance. Many of the concerns that customers have had previously with this computer have went away through Asus Updates and Windows Updates. If you can get this computer for anything less than $500.00 you have received a good deal. This is a fast computer with a lot of capabilities. It is just like any other computer the more you install on it the slower it gets. Realizing it has a small processor it is still very quick even after you add a few programs. Here are some other points or ideas.1. Microsoft Office is already installed; all you need to do is put in the accompanied code.2. Connects to any wireless printer using the same procedure as any windows computer.3. Can install a 64 GB Micro Scandisk Extreme plus SD card (the card does not stick out stays flush with the computer) for extra storage.4. It has a Long battery life and resent updates will improve recharging time.5. Display is good ( if you use reading glasses it\u2019s even better)6. Use a computer skin or a leather / synthetic leather case to hide fingerprints on outer surface. The leather case will also act as padding.7. Use a stylus or screen cover to limit fingerprints on screen (my wife prefers the stylus).8. As mentioned earlier It can also be used like a Laptop, Tablet or a KindleThere are a lot more things I could say about this computer but the bottom line, this is a keeper. Windows 8.1 is constantly improving as is this Asus Computer. Make sure you keep up with the updates. Research any problems online using reviews and YouTube before getting frustrated with this computer. There are a lot of tips out there about Windows 8.1 and this computer. You can spend $1000.00 on a new TV, $2000.00 on a new computer, $30,000.00 on a new car etc. and still have problems with them. Anytime something is mass produced there will be problems. Next year this computer will have more features and a bigger price tag. Why wait to pay for extra features that you probably will never use.

Essig", "ReviewID": "R2433O3GDMNBOX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this primarily to test the performance of the Bay Trail processor and thus far I have been pleasantly surprised.  Gone are the old days of frustratingly slow Atom processors.  This device is the perfect evolution of the netbook.Build - Not bad at all for the price.  I believe it is the lightest Win8 10inch tablet and is about the same as my GF's Ipad2.  I like the slight visual texture on the back but hate the glossy.  I have seen so many Asus tablets that are lovely and not glossy, so I am disappointed that it was glossy.  Not really a big deal since I ended up putting a skin on mine.  The plastic around the bevel of the screen is a little soft and got a tiny ding when I bumped the edge against the box that the T100 came in.  Then again, the box was sharp enough to draw blood so maybe the plastic will be fine.  A tiny bit of flex, but there is only so much you can do with plastic of this caliber.  For the price, it is fantastic.Screen - Good screen with great viewing angles.  Plenty of brightness for me.  Colors seem a touch off (a little too yellow), so I am still trying to figure out if that is normal or not and see if I can adjust it.  Resolution might seem low, but it is great for a 10 inch screen, particularly if you spend a lot of time in desktop mode like I do.  I can't imagine how tiny 1080p would render text.  Using Win8 apps, you can notice the slightly lower resolution if holding close, but it is no different than something like the Ipad2.  Touch has been nice and responsive.Keyboard - The keyboard is definitely cramped and I am still getting used to it, but is fine for emails and short documents.  It is a little disappointing that they made the keys so short when I have seen Asus put much larger keys on similarly sized docks.  Not sure why they changed them.  Would definitely have been nice for a battery and an extra usb port in the dock, but for a free throw in, it is fantastic.  The trackpad isn't super responsive, but it is far more usable than some have said.  For anything that I really need some precision for, I will be using a mouse anyways (or just touch the screen).Performance - Pleasantly surprised by the performance.  The Metro UI screen scrolls smoothly and Win8 apps open quickly and run well so far.  For the desktop and more traditional programs, I haven't run into any issues.  Programs are definitely slow to install, and some, like Inkscape take a little longer to open than on my i5 desktop, but so far work without a problem.  I don't plan to do a lot of rendering or editing on this device, so performance is more than good enough.  I'd wager it would be good enough for 90% of regular users.  1080P video played without a hitch as has any video site that I have tried.  I was thinking originally that I would go with an i3 or i5 based tablet, but this has done well enough that I don't think that will be necessary now.  An important thing to note is that the battery life on this thing is stellar!  Easily over the 10 hour mark with mixed straight use at mid brightness.  Standby is great too.  When I use this as a consumption device in tablet mode, I go a couple days of use between charges.  So nice to have full windows functionality in a device so nice to hold and use.The only real thing I wish this had was a pressure sensitive pen, but I understand that that would have increased weight, thickness and price.  For the money, I can't be mad.  I got a capacitive pen and it works pretty well, just lacking that bit of precision that comes with an active digitizer.  OK for now, for as much as I would like to take handwritten notes or make amazing art on this device, I just don't do either enough to really stress about it.All in all, super pleased with this device and am amazed at the value.  To do better, you would be looking at something like the Dell Venue Pro 11, which has slightly better specs, the pen I'd love, but starts at $500 without keyboard.  I am surprised not more people are talking about this device in the mainstream.  Netbooks were so crappy, yet millions of people used them as their primary or secondary devices.  This bad boy is the perfect evolution.  Better screen, touch, much, much, much better performance, way better battery life and weight, multiple form factors, and at about the same price of the nicer netbooks.  Stunning value.  Highly recommended.", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "The whole is greater than the sum of the parts", "Author": "W. Young", "ReviewID": "REB1WHSBA7VJI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're just looking for a tablet for playing games, web browsing, social media and music and videos, there are better options than this available.  If you are looking for a notebook for running mainstream business apps, such as MS Office, there are also better options than this.  However, if you're looking for something that lets you do both, and at a very attractive price point, this is a great device for you.First, you get full Windows 8.1 (32-bit), instead of Windows RT.  This means you can run many legacy x86 Windows desktop applications.  Also, you get  full-featured Internet Explorer 11, which helps make up for the lack of Modern UI apps currently available in the Windows Store.  You can install Java, Shockwave, and other plugins. Built-in Adobe Flash allows you to watch video from services like Amazon Instant Video, YouTube and Vudu, which don't currently have apps available for them.  There are apps for some popular services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and Kindle.  Also, since this is true Windows 8.1, driver support for devices such as printers won't be a problem.Also, with the quad-core Bay Trail Atom Z3740 processor, 2GB of memory and solid state storage (I strongly recommend the 64GB version), performance is much improved over past netbook-sized PCs.  MS Office 2013 apps open quickly (Home and Student, with full-featured Excel, Word, PowerPoint and OneNote, is included).  3D games from the Windows Store, like Hydro Thunder, play great on the T100.  Xbox 360 controller support is also a plus.  Connectivity on the tablet is decent, with micro USB, micro HDMI, and MicroSD slots, as well as a 3.5mm stereo headphone/speaker jack.  Finally, battery life on the T100 is great.  It's advertised at 11 hours.  I haven't checked the life on mine, but it has lasted noticeably longer than the ASUS TF700 Android tablet that it replaced.The included keyboard/touchpad dock adds to the value of the tablet, since this is an extra cost on other tablets, although it has taken some getting used to.  The dock adds a full-sized USB 3.0 port, which gives you a lot of device connectivity options, including high-speed USB to Gigabit Ethernet adapters, and external hard drives, with USB 3.0's fast data transfer rate.  The keys on the keyboard are small, so those with large hands may have some frustration using it, and the touchpad leaves something to be desired.  You can connect a Bluetooth or USB keyboard or mouse (or both, with a USB hub).At this price point, it's not surprising that ASUS had to make some compromises in the T100.  The case is plastic, rather than metal cases other tablets, such as the Apple iPad or Microsoft Surface 2, use.  This does make it feel somewhat cheaper than a metal cased tablet, at least to me.  The tablet and keyboard dock both do feel sturdy, however.Also, the resolution on the 10.1\" display is only 1366x768, while other tablets have 1920x1080 and higher resolutions.  It's definitely not the equal of the Super IPS+ 1920x1200 display in my Transformer Pad Infinity, or the 2048x1536 resolution of the iPad's Retina display.  However, it's good enough for me, given the versatility of the T100.The T100 isn't the best at any single thing it does, but when you combine everything you get, especially for the price, it's the best value in a Windows tablet/small notebook right now, in my opinion, and is worth looking at if you want one device for business apps, multimedia content, web browsing, social media and tablet gaming.

Video's from web services, Remote Desktop for viewing your home recordings remotely, and Virtual drives for accessing otherwise unavailable games, the limitations of such a compact platform can be mitigated.The built in Bluetooth, WiFi, USB 3.0, crisp IPS 720+ HD display, USB charging instead of a proprietary charger, perfectly performing multi-touch on the display and 12+ hour battery life, rounds off this less than $400 bargain.AND, this beauty starts in an instant and only sips power while unplugged in sleep mode, meaning instant starts without having to power the thing off and only have around 8% less battery than when I fell asleep 7+ hours ago.CON'S:The built in WiFi is actually a 2-in-1 chip, bluetooth and wifi. While using the bluetooth the internet WILL RANDOMLY STOP RECEIVING... which means that if you are connected to WiFi for more than 2 hours with your bluetooth headset in, watching an awesome movie... it will just randomly stop working. Super annoying.Also, the bluetooth seems to share a bit of the processing bandwidth with the WiFi, which means a little slower internet connection. It's not a huge deal but can definitely detract from a 720p HD video experience because of slower communication rates.The USB 2.0 charging cable is incredibly short compared to a normal laptop. The charge time is also very very slow. With the brightness all the way up the battery will actually discharge while plugged in, while using it. Thankfully even at 50% brightness it is amazingly clear, crisp and bright. On that note, it has built in USB 3.0, which has MUCH higher amperage tolerances, what in the world was ASUS thinking not giving us USB 3.0 charging capabilities, KNOWING it would be backwards with USB 2.0 chargers and devices....The on-screen keyboard does NOT always show when I want it to... in fact the only time I can guarantee it showing up is when first logging into windows.ATKOSD2.exe is an absolute waste of manpower, skills, MY computers resources and my own personal sanity. What a horrible idea to even install that software into the laptop. It isn't even turned on (ATKOSD2.exe is a file name which means Asus Tool Key On Screen Display). Out of all the problems that I've had with this laptop, that one was the worst. And if you tell that file to show on screen, it will show the darn overlay continuously, which oscillates between \"AC Connected\" and \"AC Disconnected\"...I deleted that file as soon as I realized it was crashing my video games, causing my keyboard to not function, and eat up all my computer resources.Last problem I had was with the single USB 3.0 jack in the keyboard dock. Sometimes it decides to recognize older USB 2.0 devices, and most of the time not. Once it recognizes the device, it usually works 100% of the time thereafter, with the exception of printers.Overall, this was an exceptional value.

I actually liked what Windows 8 was trying to do, but noticed that it was designed for touch screen devices. With the ASUS Transformer Book the promise is delivered. This specific product, and the general class of touch-tablet/keyboard products really show what Windows 8.1 can be and I like it.I've found that the keyboard, though small, can hold up pretty good for me when doing a lot of typing. It's actually larger than an earlier ASUS netbook's keyboard (3-4 year old device) and the feedback is pretty clear. The touchpad works just fine, but I find preferring to use the touch screen itself when at all possible. This is a great hybrid of a product that easily serves as stand alone tablet and desk based portable. I can't wax enthusiastically enough about this.It DOES take a lot of time to recharge and I recommend you basically plug this in at night.

My son's $3,000 laptop can do that too, but he's got an auxiliary battery pack and it weighs a ton.The only specific thing I don't like about this product? The connection to the keyboard gives an ambiguous \"thunk\" rather than a satisfying \"click\" when connected. In early use I sometimes thought the keyboard was connected when it wasn't. I took a week or so to get a feel for when it truly was connected. Once the keyboard is seated, I find I can easily use this propped up on my chest with my glasses off as is my wont.

I have a Sandy Bridge i7-2600K desktop and an Ivy Bridge i5-3317U Ultrabook - so I know what power is - but this tablet does not disappoint.  It handles Netflix and 1080p videos just fine.  Sure, it won't run Photoshop or AutoCAD (well, it might but I didn't try), but it'll run StarCraft 2 on low settings at 30-40fps.  Some might complain about the modest screen resolution compared to the Nexus 10 or the iPad retina display, but have you ever tried running Windows at 1080p on a 10-11\" screen?  I have (on the Surface Pro), and Windows doesn't scale too well so text is either tiny or awkward.  Plus, iOS and Android (excluding Samsung's multi-view) do not let you run apps side by side.  With Windows 8 you can snap two Metro apps or run as many side by side as you want on the classic desktop.The tablet by itself is light and solid, the keyboard is fairly comfortable (and doesn't need to be charged), the multi-touch gestures on the trackpad work reasonably well, and the USB port is super convenient.

I have been searching for a replacement for a 2010 netbook that I used as a casual \"on the couch\" handy computer.  I wanted a tablet but absolutely needed to have Office for work and other uses AND a keyboard.  As others have noted, the ASUS comes with Office Home/Student which is perfect for my needs.  I have a desktop for heavy duty work and the ASUS zenbook for travel.  (I am not a gamer.)Getting used to Windows 8.1 (because I am used to 7) is a challenge but will be worth the effort. The ASUS found my wireless printer immediately and was a breeze to connect to other devices in the house. I followed the suggestions of other users when it arrived:  I charged it fully for 8 hours.  I went thru the setup and put it on my wireless network. Next, I changed the settings so that windows would download updates automatically but not install them. I checked ASUS live updates (none were needed UPDATED--checked again the next day and installed a bios 220 upgrade without issues).  Then, I changed the settings so that the device would not go into sleep into mode (other users have had issues with the Windows updates not completely successfully or even \"bricking\" the device).  Finally, I ran all the Windows updates and kept my fingers crossed.  After about 15 minutes these were complete and the computer had restarted.  All is well.  I will change the settings back to automatically installing updates in a few days.This device (or \"booklet\" as one reviewer termed it) is perfect for my needs (I can use as a Kindle reader and easily watch my Slingbox).

After seeing the reviews on this I decided to take the plunge and am very happy I did. For my usage it is just about perfect and I would change or add very little. The size and weight are perfect and the price is a steal. The screen is excellent - both videos and characters are sharp and clear. The touchpad is the first one I have ever used that works well, in fact, so well I seldom use my mouse. The touch screen as good as any of our other toys, including an LG G2 and several Fire HDs as well as a new 7\" HDX. The keyboard is excellent for my use - I am a lousy typist and use the 'hunt and peck' system. It is obviously smaller than a regular keyboard and might not be as good for an experienced typist. But, that said, this is a compact device and allowances must be made for that. The onscreen keyboard really great and large enough to use comfortably. Fit and finish are excellent although the back is a shiny fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out. It's not a big deal for me, however. I am coming from a 14\" Win 7 laptop (which has been resigned to the shelf) and it has taken me a couple of days to begin to find my way around the Win 8.1 - but the 8.1 is the 'cats meow' for me. I really like it. I had a problem signing in to my MS Live account the first day and ASUS Tech Support resolved my problem shortly. (MS tech support declined). The second day, Windows did a rather large update and after rebooting, I lost use of my touchpad. Again I contacted ASUS and they answered the phone and helped me resolve the problem - in English yet. So far, am very pleased with ASUS. With the 64GB native memory and an extra 32GB in the sd slot, I find I have plenty of memory even without the Skydrive and ASUSclouddrive .The frosting on the cake is the included free MS Office. Don't let the seemingly meager hardware specs fool you. This is a very snappy performer and does better than the Acer Aspire 14\" with a Pentium processor and 4GB memory.

After days of reading countless reviews and making my decision on what I wanted from a tablet/laptop, I pulled the trigger on the ASUS and it arrived in two days (love Amazon Prime)!As stated in the instructions and in reviews, I plugged in my new toy and let it charge for 8+ hours before turning it on.  Check.After (somewhat) patiently waiting, it was time to turn on my lil bundle of new tech happiness...or so I thought.  I turned on the system and quickly made my way through the initial setup.  At first, I thought this was necessary to use the keyboard as it did not yet work.  Well, turns out this is not the case.  The problem is the tablet portion would not stay seated in the keyboard dock.  I had to reseat it about 10 times for it to actually work...for about ten seconds...and then that nice little sound would go off; the one indicating connection between the keyboard and tablet was lost (this sound would later haunt me in my dreams that night).  So I re-seated it, again...and again...and again.....aaaand again.  At first this was really frustrating and certain colorful adjectives were thrown, but then it became a game to see who could adjust the tablet portion the least before causing the disconnect.Next issue, I did not notice it initially on a light background, but as I switched back and forth between light and dark backgrounds, I noticed what looked like a star saying hello...but alas, it was not a star, rather a dead pixel.  At first I thought I could over look this, but much like a squirrel to a dog, it constantly caught my attention and I could not avoid looking at it (think about the principal in movie Uncle Buck and you'll know what I mean).Finally, the system seemed to run a bit on the slower side after two or three applications were opened.  I realize it only has 2 Gb of memory, but the app running were not that intensive and should not have caused that much stress to to the system.OK, one more thing (and this is no fault of the tablet, but worth mentioning).  If you are in the market for a tablet or PC that plays well with the \"cool kid apps\", you may want to reconsider using a Windows based tablet/PC.  Microsoft attempts to make carbon copies of a lot of today's popular apps, but fails miserably in execution.I hope this helps and I wish you well in your search for tablet/laptop utopia.

I paid $450, knowing the average price was less because I needed the Transformer before tax season. 82 days into tax season and on the fifth time that I docked the tablet to the keyboard the screen cracked from the left port and spider up to the right in front of my eyes.  Dealing with ASUS has been a very slow arduous process.  It took me four calls to get an RMA number as ASUS's system was down.  All four agents seem to be reading from a script and stated that I needed to return the product and would not listen to the facts of the case.  They all just stated that there could be a \"potential\" charge and I would have to call back when the system was up.  They would not let me speak with a supervisor and said that I had to return the product before they could elevate the case.  Well, I crossed my fingers and sent the product back on April 3, 2014. I enclosed a letter explaining what happened, provided proof that I purchased a protective case and assured them that the product was not mishandled given there was not one scratch or dent on any surface of the product.  After checking several times with support, I finally got an email on April 17, 2014 stating that there would be a $137 charge to fix and return the product.  Given that I did not drop the tablet, had it in a protective cover and knew that I did not cause the crack, I called back today and asked if I could now speak with a supervisor since I had followed the instruction to first return the product.  Support (Megan) was very pleasant and said not to worry that a case manager could handle the review.  She put me at ease, but when I requested to be transfer to the case manager; Megan said unfortunately she is not available. To complicate matters the email that I received stated that if I did not pay for the repairs by 4/21 (in 4 days) ASUS would return my product without repairs.  Megan stated that it would take 2-4 business days for the case manager to return my call and she would ensure that the product was not returned until a case manager looked at my product, but given that no one else had this problem she was not hopeful. Now I have a very bad feeling that no one will be looking into my case, the computers were never down, and I will have wasted $28 shipping the product back to ASUS.  So now, I am close to $500 out of pocket.  I did a search and found that others had the same issue and several reviews had pointed out the poor construction of the screen.  In retrospect, I should have taken it to a local shop for repairs as it would have been cheaper, but given I was sure that ASUS would honor the warranty given the facts, I wasted the money on the postage that would have paid 50% of the cost to repair it locally.  I am sorry to say that I own all ASUS products and given how my case has been handled, I am now faced with the harsh reality of buying a back up computer as I use them all for business.  If I encountered this problem with all my systems during tax season, I would be out more than just a computer-I would have lost my business.

(I want everything on the tablet itself!)Why have an ipad or other non-Windows tablet when you can have it all on this wonderful device, which is a tablet or laptop at will - the keyboard pops on and off in a second. Its 10-inch screen is larger than an ipad or kindle 8.9, though a similar weight (1.2 lbs). Although it has a touchpad, I rarely use it - touching the screen takes the place of moving and clicking the mouse. (To right-click, hold the touch longer.) If there are several selections close together, your finger may seem too large to select the one you want, but as long as your touch is centered on the selection it will work. (Or use a capacitive-touch stylus.)I use this wonderful wifi tablet for email, shopping, googling, and even real work when away from my desktop. For folks who don't like Windows 8.1, all you do when you see the colorful screen full of tiles (icons) is tap the Desktop tile. When on the desktop or elsewhere, to change settings or shut down, swipe inwards from the right edge of the screen (Charms). If you ever get \"stuck\" within Windows 8.1 screens, press alt/F4 to exit.The 10-inch screen is great for reading PDF ebooks, such as those found on google books, internet archive, and reading sites such as oliphantfiction dot com. The best PDF reader when using it as a tablet is probably SumatraPDF. Touch or make a slight swipe to the right to page forward; make a slight swipe to the left to page backward; touch with two fingers to swap it in or out of reading mode. Also if you enlarge the page with a finger/thumb gesture, the larger page size will be retained when you page forward, which some PDF readers don't do. (You can still read kindle ebooks using Kindle for PC.)Added 5-30-2014:This device supports Widi - meaning you can wirelessly beam a video onto your HDTV. If the HDTV has Widi built in, you don't need anything else. If not, make sure your HDTV has a free HDMI port, then buy something like the Actiontec Screenbeam Pro (see my review).Almost forgot to mention a battery life issue: Battery life should be about 11 hours. If the battery seems to be draining quickly, even when not in use, the Bios may need updating. The first part is easy - go to the Asus T100TA downloads and download Bios 304 and the utility Winflash (windows bios flash utility). There is nothing to \"run\" in the traditional way. Updating the Bios takes many precise steps. If you phone Asus for support they will walk you through it. (There are several steps where you need to hold down a key for minutes at a time - don't release until told to.) If you are totally non-technical, you can mail in the T100TA to be upgraded.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for any use.", "Author": "SKishan", "ReviewID": "R12O7J99VYHGKQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for the past 3 weeks.

The screen was better than I expected and everything worked with no issues. I got Photoshop, Lightroom, and many other desktop applications on it. Beware that the metro \"apps\" will only install to your C: drive so watch out for that 32GB C drive space. At least Asus didn't created a recovery partition on 32GB models as they do on 64GB one, instead they put in a separate recovery prom. So far I found 32GB sufficient but I also have a 32GB TF card as D drive. One gripe is that the TF card sticks out too much and its easy to accidentally knock it out and lose it. This issue was solved by putting it in IVSO leather case which is pretty good. I could even dock it with the case on although the screen dust cover flap then hang behind the tablet. But it becomes less unwiedly once folded into a stand.The main complain I have is with the charging connector - not just for this but for any device that uses these micro-USB connectors as they are really hard to plug in.

I spent 6 hours researching, updating the Broadcom wireless drivers, change various settings and resetting the tablet to factory settings 3 times so far to try different combinations of drivers and network settings and it still did not connect to my wireless network.I am a techie, set up my own network and have 1 desktop running Ubuntu/Windows, 2 laptops running Windows 7, 1 laptop running XP, 2 iPads, 1 Galaxy Tab tablet, 1 Galaxy s3 and 1 s4 phone, 1 Airave VoIP, all on the same network peacefully and everything works, but not the T100.The folks on the Transformer Forum were exceptional in their effort to research and help each other to solve similar problems with wifi connection (or the lack of it and its stability).  When you see 175 posts just on this forum alone on this topic since February 2014, you know that this is a persistent problem.The ASUS Support web site provided the updates for BIOS and various drivers for the same issues.  However, there are no release notes as noted by members of the Transformer Forum so it's hard to tell which problems are being solved by which driver.  ASUS has a automatic update facility but it only works if you are connected to the Internet and since the T100 does not have an Ethernet port and wireless connection does not work, you are out of luck.I tried to contact ASUS online chat but they are not available due to the weekend schedule.  Will give it one more try by calling ASUS Monday night but if the call does not resolve the wifi connection issue, I have no choice but returning it to Amazon.  I would definitely appreciate a call from ASUS Support who could help me to resolve the wireless connection problem.*** June 4th Update ***ASUS Tech did not call me back so I decided to completely wipe the machine and reload everything from scratch, twice, and it now works like a charm.  I suspect that Windows 8 and the ASUS T100 together is potentially still a hit-or-miss kind of installation given the feedback of others.The laptop has been working very well since I reloaded Windows 8 from scratch.  Below are a few observations and tips:1.  Make sure that the screen docks into the keyboard in one smooth and firm motion (holding top of the screen with one hand and the dock hinge with the other hand and push them against each other), otherwise not all of the contacts are made and you need to enter the password using the screen instead of the keyboard.2.  Some users already mentioned this, the keyboard is not the most stable and is prone to sliding around on hard surfaces (desk, table, airplane tray) since it rests on 2 very tiny raised plastic ridges (part of the docking hinge).  I am planning to get 2 small rubber bump-stops and stick them next the plastic ridges to stop the machine from sliding around.  ASUS could improve this simple design next time by doing the same.3.  The screen does not open wide enough as a typical laptop would.  This is a compromise to prevent the screen, being heavier than the keyboard, to tip the whole thing over.  You could raise the table or lower your chair for better viewing angle or simply visit a local computer store to see if you could live with it.4. The machine is fast even with Windows 8, file save and retrieval is pleasantly fast (I ordered a 64 GB micro SD card to save files).  I would also recommend ordering a 16 GB USB drive (the partition will not back itself onto a 16 GB micro SD card) to back up the Windows 8 restore partition for safe keeping.  Once backed up, you can remove the partition to free up space on the 64 GB main memory.5.  For those of us who don't have (or don't want to buy) an external DVD drive to install software which come on CD-ROM, you could set up the T100 to be part of your home network (which has another computer with the CD-ROM drive available) and access the drive from your T100 to install your software.  I installed Quicken this way and it saved me money and a trip to the store to buy an external drive.6.  Given the installation glitches I had, I have not updated the BIOS until I am done with what I need to do right now.  Hopefully the update will lengthen battery life.I am \"upgrading\" my feedback to 4 stars.

But beyond that, a similar iPad would cost nearly $200 more and NOT have a physical keyboard or hard drive. So, value points definitely go to the Asus T100 and Windows 8.1.  Win 8 is definitely better than Android, although the Windows app store is somewhat pathetic.  So many of the apps that I have on both my iOS and Android devices are not available from Windows.  But taking the previous caveats into consideration, I love my new notebook/tablet. For one thing, there is an actual delete key (not just a backspace key that is called \"delete\") on the physical keyboard, something that is not available on either Apple or Android.  Plus this uses the same file system as all other Windows computers and as such makes adding and managing music, documents and other files really easy, especially when I have been using PC's for more than 20 years.  Only  four stars due to plastic construction and sad app store, but well the money in every other aspect.  If you are looking for a small notebook that can also double as a tablet, look no farther.  This is the real deal!!!UPDATE (4-29-2014) Be careful when downloading or installing third party programs from any source other than the app store.  I downloaded and installed Firefox and set it as the default - juat as I have done with any other Windows computer I have ever used.  This basically crashed the machine and I had to look on line to find out how to completely reset the T100 to factory specs.  Thankfully this worked and my notebook is just fine again.

I guess i'll start by saying that the keyboard and mouse are better than I expected and don't feel cheap and neither does the tablet, overall the devices feels very sturdy and beefy, I was expecting it to be light as a feather, have no weight and feel cheap, couldn't have been further from the truth, this thing feels quality and to me that means alot.The tablet snaps in the base really clean with a little pressure, which makes it more deep and secure. The tablet does not outweigh the keyboard it sits level and doesn't tip backwards like I thought it may, it's solid.Windows 8.1 itself is dreamy great and smooth install, just a few settings and it's running, no bloatware only 3 programs running after full install including features such as cloud storage. 37 GB storage left after full install. Games and applications can be installed to an additional MicroSD if you decide to buy one, I installed Steam to the MicroSD and a few games and they run fast and fluid off the MicroSD.I've only run a few games on the device so far, but what I have ran has run well such as Minecraft, Terraria and Guild Wars are all very playable and in the 20-30 fps zone with maxed graphics and resolution. I may amend this review later to include more game testing but since it runs what I wanted it's all i'm including in this review, needless to say it is adequate and will run some decent games and the games it runs look and are much better than android games obviously.The main reason I bought this though was for the included Microsoft Office Home and Student which not only is pre-installed, but comes with the official seal of purchase serial sticker in the package, so you just enter the serial code and keep and you're good to go, very easy. It also comes with an official warranty serial sticker included inside the manual for proof of ownership which is great. Also the screen is bright and the sound is great, both better than expected.This thing is worth the money, really nothing more to say. It doesn't feel cheap, it does everything a laptop does and has the convenience of also being a tablet....a Windows 8.1 tablet that is.... that you can detach and walk around the house while you do spreadsheets, watch a movie or continue a game while you do other things, that alone is worth the price of admission.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it but had one issue with the auto rotate", "Author": "Blwessels \"Blwessels\"", "ReviewID": "R70LSDJBTW4QB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just got this yesterday.  Have a Toshiiba Thrive tablet that I've had nothing but problems with and a larger laptop that I wanted to downsize. After pricing and seeing how expensive the Surface was I went with this much cheaper, yet similar laptop tablet combo that seemed to have all the same features I'd want with the Surface Pro 2, included keyboard and included Office (The Pro 2 gave you Office for a year).Found this a breeze to set up, keyboard attaches/detaches very easily.  Connecting to the internet is smooth and quick (biggest issue with my Thrive was how sluggish it was to go online).  The keyboard seems solid with my only complaint being that the mouse/touchpad part of it seems a little flimsy but I am using a wireless mouse with it so that's not an issue.I could have sworn when I was first checking things out that the screen did indeed auto rotate for me but last night when I wanted to settle down to read a book from my Kindle App it would not rotate and I started to look for some \"auto rotate\" feature and could not find anything anywhere.  This morning when I got up I looked through the questions people have asked about the product and some asked if this auto rotates and the answer was yes but mine wasn't doing that.So I did an online search and found a Asus Transformer forum where many were having this issue and found out how to get it to do that again.  Here's the cut and pasted solution for any having this issue: IT IS A SIMPLE FIX - First trick of troubleshooting:\"Device Manager>InvenSense Sensor Collection>Disable>EnableShould work like normalLittle rotation lock above brightness slider reappears\"If you notice, the last line says \"the little rotation lock above the brightness slider reappears\".  That was the case with me as well, that was gone until I did the fix so any reading this and thinking why didn't she just unlock it, well, the option to do that was not showing up.  Kind of weird but at least there is a fix.I'd give this five stars if it wasn't for that issue, shouldn't have had to go searching the web to find a way to turn my auto rotation back on and there is definitely an issue when it's messing up and the option to turn it back on disappears from view.In comparison to my Toshiba Thrive, this thing feels so much better.  Apps that are available in both the Windows App Store and Google Play  Apps store are working much smoother than they were on my Thrive and not booting me out.  I can't get a Candy Crush app from Windows but I can at least go to my Facebook page on this and play it.  I could get a Candy Crush app on my Thrive but I couldn't play it because it would freeze up on me immediately and boot me out no matter how many times I uninstalled it and reinstalled it.

A friend was able to plug in her thumb drive for me to get some files to edit for her. Worked great.

Asus! This is my first time purchasing an Asus product and thus far I am extremely pleased. This tablet exceeds my expectations.I have no complaints since I bought the T100 32 gig model a little over a week now. All functions of this device work well from battery, to charging time, the precision and responsiveness of the touch screen, the touch pad, etc. Overall, the performance of this tablet is excellent, it's very speedy running apps as well as full size software programs although I have not installed any heavy duty resource consuming software programs either, but with Intel's newest Bay Trail quad core processor, I don't anticipate having any issues for every day computing tasks using typical software applications including Microsoft games like solitaire and mahong.I also have a 7inch android tablet that has an Nvidia Tegra 3 quad core processor which runs superbly fast, but I needed and wanted a larger screen windows 8 tablet with similar hardware specs of my android device. So quad core processor, at least 2 gig of ram, bluetooth, mini or micro hdmi port etc. And then, getting a docking keyboard along with a full size USB port is a definite plus along with MS office home and student as part of the package. This sealed the deal for me.I really enjoy using windows 8 on a tablet, whereas before when I used windows 8 on non-touch PC's I did not like the experience so much. Now that I am using the T100 tablet/laptop, I can appreciate the logic of the hybrid OS design that Microsoft created because I am essentially using a hybrid touch screen device thus unleashing the full capabilities of windows 8 and this has resulted in a positive end user experience for me. I have been using this tablet every day since I bought it! It's hard to put it down and now I am not even interested in using my older high end dell laptop with windows 7 or my high performing android tablet anymore.For those of you who do not feel comfortable typing on the smaller T100 keyboard (and this will mostly be guys) I recommend using a full size Bluetooth keyboard. At least you could use a full size Bluetooth keyboard at home, although it may not be practical for travel. I paired one of my bluetooth keyboards to test the bluetooth feature on the tablet and it worked like a charm. I have not experienced any adverse hardware issues at this point, knock on wood.Overall the Asus Transformer T100 is a lovely gem of a tablet for the price!", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good", "Author": "Rob", "ReviewID": "R185NKT5BXP8Q7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little device.

I've had my Asus T100 tablet for about 2 weeks now and I am so happy with it. I'm glad I did a lot of research prior to making a purchase because I got the right product. The product is compact but still feels like and works like a computer that I can get real work done on. I already have an Ipad, but I have office work to do using Microsoft Office and the Ipad doesn't do the job. I was able to load my Microsoft Office 2010 package as well as a couple of other software packages. The choice to type or touch the screen works well and the T100 is small enough for me to turn it sideways to read documents without removing the keyboard if I don't want to.The only thing I'm disappointed about is that my USB modem doesn't work when plugged into the USB on this tablet. From my internet research, I've found that this is the case with other tablets too, not just the Asus T100. I already have a Cradlepoint Personal Hotspot that I purchased on Amazon.com that works with my USB modem so I will have to carry the hotspot at all times.

Forget about iPad and other Tablets.", "Author": "George Platopoulos", "ReviewID": "R3AWO5K8XHO4MU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great Tablet / Laptop / Workstation, as the title said, forget about iPad and other tablets, they don't hold a candle to this one.Unlike many other tablets, this is an actual PC packed into a tablet that runs the same version of Windows as the tower PC sitting under your desk would run.  In this case, this Asus runs Windows 8.1 (32bit).  It is powered by a quad core Intel Atom processor (1.3Ghz per core), has 2GB or RAM and a 64GB solid-state lighting fast Hard Drive, so it has plenty of Get-Up and Go.This Asus comes with a multifunction laptop keyboard & touchpad, the screen locks into the keyboard and releases with a touch of a button.  A nice thing here is that you don't get ripped off by having to spend $100-$200 on a keyboard like other tablets.  This base that encloses the keyboard & touchpad also has a full size USB 3.0 port.  (adapters are available to connect regular size USB devices into the Micro-USB port found on the tablet screen portion, as well)On the tablet portion of this Asus (the screen), you have volume control buttons, power/sleep button, speakers, Micro USB port, Micro HDMI port, Micro SD memory card port, Camera, Microphone and head phone jack.  In addition, Microsoft Office is included (minus outlook, access)The screen resolution and sharpness is awesome with precise and effortless touch screen and the screen rotation works great.So here are some useful accessories I found to make this Tablet / PC give even more than it already does.First thing I bought was a 64GB micro SD memory card, this instantly doubles your storage capacity to 128GB of storage without any bulk, it basically vanishes when you insert the card and you have a second hard drive now.  Large files such as photos and music get stored on my SD memory card, as well as a folder to archive applications that are downloaded from the web..ect.  This allows space to be free for speed sensitive items such as applications to run off the solid state hard drive.Next I bought a clear screen protector to protect the screen and a leather case that was made to fit this tablet whether the keyboard is attached or not to protect from accidental drops.Next was a 4 port USB Hub (the kind with connecting cable that is about 3 inches long permanently attached to the hub).  When the keyboard attached and I am working at my desk,  I plug this Hub into the full size USB port in the keyboard enclosure, and now have increased the number of USB ports by 400%.In this Hub, I connect the next thing I bought, which is a wireless mouse and my 1-TB external hard drive for backing up files, my MP3 player, and any other USB device you have.Next, I picked up an external USB  slim DVD reader/writer, if you need to burn some music or install a program you bought from the electronics store, you can do it.Next thing was a HDMI cable that has a Micro-HDMI connector (plugs into tablet) on one side and standard HDMI (plugs into monitor or HDTV) on the other.  I also bought a slight variation of this cable with the Micro-HDMI on one end and a DVI-D connector on the other, used to connect to digital computer monitors if they do not have a HDMI port..All these accessories will run under $100 total.I was impressed when I connected the tablet to a 24\"  LED computer monitor and I saw a perfect high resolution image.  I was more impressed when I connected the tablet to a 30\" LCD computer  monitor and again saw a perfect image.  When I connected the tablet to my 55\" HD LED TV, I was not sure how well it would work, but once again, a perfect full screen image appeared.What this means is, this does not only transform from tablet into laptop, but into a traditional PC as well.  I take this to work, connect a 24\" monitor, break out my wireless mouse and connect a standard USB PC Keyboard which I leave at the office, and I have now I have a workstation.One final bonus item here is I connect the HDMI cable from the tablet to my surround sound receiver which feeds video to the HDTV and sound to the surround sound speakers (HDMI carries both video and sound), and now I can download and watch movies or TV shows that are streamed from the web via this tablet or other sources on my HDTV with surround sound.In summary, this is a great very useful system, and your bank for your buck is incredible.", "Date": "February 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Frustrating!", "Author": "kelly peters", "ReviewID": "R1DUS3CEIZLH55", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Spent time setting it up, then when it went to sleep couldn't wake it up without a cold re-start.

I'm a college student, and purchased this device mainly for notes taking in class. I did NOT purchase it to replace a proper laptop/desktop, and did not expect any high performance out of this device. Yes it will run autocad, inventor, photoshop, but you are way better off with a proper computer(unless your computer is ancient).From my 2 weeks of using this device, I found that the main bottleneck of this tablet's performance is still the CPU. Yes the new atom Z3740 increased performance dramatically compared to the last version, but it is by no means FAST. I found it constantly turbo boosting to 1.8Ghz, and running at ~30-40% usage when playing a simple youtube video.I was amazed at the optimization of windows 8, initially I was very worried that the 2GB of RAM will simply not cut it, as I have 16GB in my desktop and 8GB in my laptop, and I'm constantly using up 4-5GB of the RAM when not doing much. But windows 8.1 amazed me, the RAM usage stayed at 0.9GB while idling, and I have never seen it above 1.7GB other than when I was installing new software or opening multiple applications. And even then the tablet does not feel \"laggy\", if there are any, it's from the CPU, which you will be finding is running at 100% usage. The RAM optimization is definitely better than windows 7, and miles ahead of XP and vista if anyone still uses those legacy OS...The internal storage is small, but I have about 32GB ish left after I installed my software that I will be using on this machine, which is not much. It is not fast, it is not a SSD, it's the same storage device found inside your typical tablet and smartphone. The read speed is fairly normal compared to a 7200rpm HDD, the write speed is extremely low. But you probably won't be installing stuff all day on this tablet so I don't think that will be too big of an issue.  Looks like I will not be putting in a microSD, as the space left is more than enough to store my pdf, ppt, excel, and word documents, but you do have the choice of adding another 64GB.I got about 5 days on a single charge of mainly standby, with occasional screen on time, at the end of the 5th day, i was at 27% charge. When I tried to use it for real, I got nearly 16 hours of battery life for word processing, this was way better than what I hoped. For mixed usage, Asus's estimate is about right, I got about 10-11 hours, and for watching video file with an external HDD connected, I got about 6 hours. This definitely gets the same if not more battery life than my Asus Tf300 which runs android 4.2.1., and yet this one runs a full blown x86 system. Intel's new atom bay-trail CPU might not be a performer, but the power draw is just amazingly low.Never tried to play games on it, and is not planning to do so, as this is not supposed to be used as a computer replacement anyway, just a way more useful tablet/notebook than ipad or android tablets at a fraction of the cost. I paid $379+tax for my device, and I think the current amazon price by sellers are just too high.Haven't seen any quality issues with my unit, some earlier batches may have issues. But if yours is manufactured in the later half of Dec 2013, you should be good.I can see how keyboard could be an issue for people who have large hands, or fingers rather, my hand size is considered average in males, and I do not find it very hard to get used to typing on it. In fact I typed this review on this device.My main complaints about this device is the very small right shift key..I keep hitting the up arrow when I want to hit the right shift key, for quotation marks, question marks etc.. they could've made the arrow key more compact and made the shift bigger.Also the keyboard and touchpad makes a lot of noise compared to my laptop. The touchpad mouse keys are especially bad, I try to avoid using the keys unless I have to right click something...but you can always use your fingers. Won't reduce a star because of it, simply because of the price point, if this was a more premium device, it would be a different story. There is also no backlit for the keyboard, but I don't look at the keyboard when I'm typing anyway, plus at sub$400 what can you expect?If you are an elderly person, or one with very bad eyesights, the fonts/icons/menus WILL BE SMALL. The DPI is pretty high on this tablet. So be aware of that before you purchase. It's not an issue if you use metro apps, but will be an issue if you want to work in desktop mode. I found the size to be fine for me, as I like smaller fonts/icons anyway to allow me to see more, when I showed it to my mother however, she claimed that it's \"tiny\" and it make her eyes hurt. The font sizes can be adjusted in the settings in windows 8 based on your preference, but even then she still says it's small for viewing in desktop mode.", "Date": "January 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "A solid little computer", "Author": "Dave in NH", "ReviewID": "R33ZZSQFAGACRO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this thinking it might be a good replacement for my I-Pad.

I found the touch screen and keyboard very responsive and it comes with a wide variety of windows type applications and is compatible with Office 2013.  It is a speedy machine, no delay between selecting the app and having it open right up.  I have rather large hands and fingers but did not find that a problem...but I would not want to type a 20 page thesis on it.  It's my first experience with windows 8.1 and for the most part, I don't see what all the negativity about that is all about.  While it allows two windows open side by side, it's sort of difficult on such a small screen.  The removable screen is a nice feature.  But, when it is connected it does not fold out all the way flat, and there were times when I wished the screen would tilt back just a bit further than it does.  During my usage I found the battery lasted about 8 hours.  Another nice feature is the ability to completely erase the machine back to its original \"out of the box\" settings with just two clicks.  Overall, if you are looking for a miniature windows 8 computer you will probably love this little package.

If it's any indication at all, Amazon has been sold out of this product several times already (still is currently) and was the number 1 top selling laptop on Amazon last I checked a few weeks back around Thanksgiving.  To provide a little background about how I use this machine, I am a college student who uses the T100 for note taking, entertainment, and general browsing.As a college student, I was looking for a computer that was light and would last all day so I could take it with me on the go that won't die in the middle of class.  I was looking at the Asus T100, several Windows ultrabooks, and the Macbook air.  However, when I thought about what I would be using this computer for, I couldn't justify spending $700-800 more on an ultrabook or Macbook when the T100 could easily last me all day through class for a mere $350.  Furthermore, I have a gaming desktop I use for anything power-intensive.  Compared to my old laptop which would die in the middle of class lasting only 1 hour, this laptop lasts an incredibly long time and can easily hit the report number of hours.I also needed a machine that could help me with productivity, and the Asus T100 definitely met that criteria as well.  As many have noted already, this machine comes with Microsoft office pre-installed (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote), which is a fantastic value considering that it would cost an additional $100 or so to buy it separately, and the Mac OS version of this software is still not up to par.  Furthermore, I also considered how useful a touchscreen would be for productivity, and so far from using it I can say that having a touchscreen has been extremely useful.  Enlarging pages with pinch-zoom is a breeze, scrolling is quick and accurate, and switching between multiple windows is quick.For the general user or student, this computer would easily fit their needs.  Don't be afraid of the atom processor or 2 gb of ram.  Atom processors have a bad name to them for being known for low-powered netbooks, but this new BayTrail atom is the perfect blend of energy efficiency, power, and speed.  I rarely ever run into any hiccups when I use the T100, and for what I use the computer for 2 gb or ram is sufficient even for full Windows 8.  In my opinion, the T100 is the nail in the coffin for Windows RT because the Surface 2 is more expensive, doesn't include a keyboard, and runs a dumbed-down version of Windows.  I expect to see many more of these sorts of tablet-laptop hybrids in the future because that is where Windows 8 really shines.  Asus has proven that you can indeed get the best of both worlds using the right hardware to support a machine that works well as a tablet and laptop, has the battery power of mobile devices, and can be used for both productivity and entertainment.That being said, the Asus T100 may not be for everyone.  For those looking for premium devices that look and feel high quality, you may wish to look elsewhere.  That's not to say this computer is extremely cheap looking, but I can definitely feel some rough edges on the tablet, can see numerous fingerprints on the back, and can hear the cheap touchpad every time I click it.  For those looking to do intensive gaming, extensive video editing, and other power-hungry tasks, I am not so sure that the processor and ram can handle those sorts of tasks efficiently.  I know for a fact that older games such as portal and Team Fortress 2 can run smoothly (there are many performance tests videos on YouTube).  LIke others have said, the keyboard is indeed smaller than a full-sized one, but I have small hands and can type very easily on it.  Because of the screen size, using the touch screen to select certain icons on desktop menus can be difficult at times, and I often have to resort to using the touchpad for more pinpoint accuracy.  If you are looking for a tablet first and laptop second, I personally think other Android/iOS options make superior tablets.  The 16:9 ratio of this tablet can be odd in portrait mode, and the Windows store as of now pales in comparison to Android/iOS.Overall, this product can't be beat for how much you get of it for how little you pay.  I am absolutely satisfied with this purchase and look forward to perhaps a more premium version of the Asus T100 with better materials and QC in the future.  The reason that this product has so many 1-star ratings is because the Asus T100 did have its glitches when it first came out.  To ensure that your computer operates as it should, definitely charge the computer for the 8 hours before turning on, update to bios 220 asap, do manual windows updates, and download the latest drivers on Asus's website.  Also, transformer forums is a great place to look up any other issues you may encounter.  I don't fault Asus for these issues because of how new this technology is and the lower price point.  Hopefully  Asus will have learned from this experience and will release more refined products in the future.

(I paid $379 for mine, though they were $299 for a bit the week before Black Friday.) So pleased to discover my expectations were ill-placed.I would say I spend about 10% of my time on it figuring out ways to circumvent Windows 8.1 and its many annoyances (although early on it was probably 40% of my time on it). The rest of the time is pure fun. I take it with me everywhere, using it mostly for email and calendar. But I've also edited meeting notes, Skyped, tethered it to my phone and checked email from my (parked) car, and most importantly, Cisco VPN'd to work and RDP'd to my desktop to work. (I'm a software developer and spend most of my time in Visual Studio.) It all worked like a dream.I almost never detach it from its keyboard but sometimes tablet mode comes in handy -- like when I was working on the water heater in my basement today and I wanted to be able to view the owner's manual PDF without being required to print it. Basically holding it and (gingerly) setting it down like I would a clipboard covered with paper.The touch screen takes some getting used to. Zeroing in on small buttons in gmail/Chrome for example. (I'm too cheap to buy a stylus and just use my pinky.) The built-in mail client that comes with Windows 8.1 is cute, but it's not integrated with gmail to the extent that I would like so I rarely use it.I did spend a little time checking out some of the games that you can download like Solitaire (the true benchmark of any Windows version.) Showing my step dad and mom (each around 70 years old) that they can play solitaire on a tablet while lying in bed was cool. My step dad is like \"where do I get one??\"It would have been better had the keyboard been Bluetooth-enabled, but that would have probably added to the price (and I can buy a Bluetooth keyboard if I really want one).I got the 64GB version, which has about 20GB free right now. I haven't installed that much, but I imagine a 32GB version would be largely useless.It says it has Office on it though it keeps trying to get me to sign up for Office 365 and use Skydrive. Not really interested in that and haven't had time to find the paperwork so I can activate the built-in version of Office. I also set up the Asus webstorage so it would stop nagging me about it, but I don't use that either. It hasn't once offered to install new updates, so I assume that's going on in the background. I haven't checked.It is perfectly silent, never gets very warm, there are no fans that I can detect.Don't expect it to be a full PC. Don't install a bunch of crap on it. It's got 2 GB of RAM.

The latter 2 are essentially entertainment toys, and there is nothing wrong with that of course. With a Windows tablet you can also perform productivity work. Indeed I am traveling with this tablet and the included keyboard in all my business trips and so far I have not regretted ones not having taken my laptop instead.Having said that, I also think this is without doubt the best value on the market. A very responsive Windows 8.1 tablet with inclusion of Office 2013 Home office and a detachable hardware keyboard which also works effectively as a stand and adds a full-size USB 3.0 port.The new 4-core Atom processor works really a lot better than the previous iteration. This is practically lag-free and I never feel slowed down in whatever I have to accomplish on a portable device like this (of course music or video encoding is not what you are supposed to use this for).The screen is very usable but not full-HD as some Android and all newer iOS tablets now offer. I have no complaints but if you see this in store displayed right next to an iPad Air the difference is noticeable. Again, this is consistent with its design. It is not as entertainment-oriented as an Apple tablet.Speakers are rather good, again for the intended usage. Battery life is great, I believe I managed to use it for about 8h during my last trip.The keyboard is quite comfortable, especially the keys. The track-pad buttons are, instead, way too hard and definitely unpleasant to use.Perhaps, in light of the first failure, the only doubts I still have concern its future reliability (hence the 4-star rating).

It arrived in short order and looked great. I followed the instructions, plugged it into the charger and waited. When I finally booted the system, I configured the PC. Everything looked great, but the keypad would not work. I tried connecting and disconnecting, booting and rebooting--nothing. Eventually, I looked on line, read the entire owner's manual, and then made the biggest mistake, I called ASUS customer service.I was not on hold long. When I explained my problem to the tech, she told me to plug in the keyboard and let it charge. Huh? There is no outlet to charge the keyboard, there was no \"power cord\" to charge the keyboard, and as far as anyone can tell, there is no battery in the keyboard. I waited on hold for a bit, she came back and changed the question I had asked, said that different models to the Transformer book had different specs, so mine, because it was built in 2013, did not have a charger for the keypad. When it became clear that she did not know what she was talking about, I asked to talk to a supervisor. She refused to let me, told me I could return the product to Amazon or send it to the company. If I sent it, a brand new computer, for repair, I could expect to wait 5 days to several weeks for the computer to be returned. Wow! I was not happy and ended the phone conversation.I called back, wanting to talk to a supervisor. This time I got R. on the phone. He told me no supervisors were available since everyone of them was in a meeting. Convenient... By that point, I was understandably upset, and my ire increased when he told me \"You were told you could return the product. I do not know why you are upset?\" Really? Eventually he stopped talking to me, left the line open so I could hear all of the background conversation--obviously outsourced outside of the US--and then he ended the call, sending me to a phone survey about the experience.I am returning the product to Amazon, less my $11 for return shipping and my 13$ screen protector fees for two reasons. Why would I want a product that comes defective and why would I want to deal with a company that has such poor customer service and does not care one bit about customer satisfaction. If you do not mind dealing with people who do not care about the product, the company, or the customer, order the product.

(huge savings!)Two: utilize One Note for your \"virtual note book\". For example: I named my notebook Spring 2014, then set up tabs for each of my classes. Within the named class tabs I added \"pages\" where I \"printed\" to one note from my college blackboard website; my syllabus, and all of my class modules (power point lectures, articles, etc). Each page is named for the module with sub-pages (ctrl n) for each section of material in that module. (tip: if you have a large print out, select print to one page - not multiple pages! - If single page does not show as an option \u25cb Click file / options / advanced * Scroll down to \"printing\" and un-check insert long printouts on multiple pages)*If you use onedrive (formerly skydrive) you can access all of your files during class as well (your papers, assignments, presentations, etc.) using your schools wi-fi. I highly recommend this as I use my laptop to create my papers/assignments and can work on them at anytime without worrying about having access to my work when I go straight to class with my ASUS, from my office.Three: During class type your notes right into the pages you have printed to, or downloaded into one note.You can access your text and even search to specific sections/words/phrases using ctrl f far faster then thumbing through your text bookFour: the best part - no more lugging heavy (expensive) printed text books and huge binders with tons of paper.Just make sure your tablet has a full charge and you are ready to go!As a final note - I have saved so much on the purchase of text books, paper, pens, folders and the like that my ASUS paid for itself with the savings. For classes I knew I didn't need to keep my text book, I rented, saving hundreds of dollars without even counting my savings on \"school supplies!\".In my opinion this is a must for any college student and has made my graduate career a breeze!", "Date": "May 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Does not display in 16:9 via HDMI 2nd display", "Author": "Paul Bismarck", "ReviewID": "R3A8KJ2PPKSZX1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After over a month of attempting a resolution with ASUS - started prior to the posting of this review - ASUS still places the cause of the issue on 2nd displays.  However, they acknowledge that it will work in 2nd display which is true.  However, all this demonstrates is that the display/monitor/HDMI port has the clear capability to display to a 2nd screen in full 16:9 display.  Their explanation is that it is not an issue with the T100 but the 2nd displays (many of them) which do not have the ability to adjust the display size to the output of the T100.  The flaw in this is that all 2nd displays actually display what is being transmitted to them via the HDMI connection based upon the SOURCE of the device that is sending the data/format to the 2nd display.  This is an automatic for 2nd displays regardless of what type of device is connected to the 2nd display including laptops, streaming devices (such as the Roku devices), set-top cable boxes, DVRs - anything connected via HDMI will, the 2nd display will automatically detect and display the content in the format it is being transmitted via the HDMI connection.  Duplicate display settings in the T100 should have no impact in this auto-detection and display on any device unless the T100 is only transmitting in 4:3 display size.  Since they are using a generic PnP display driver from 2006 prior to even Windows 7 much less Windows 8.1.  Their promotional videos show the T100 tablet displaying both on the tablet and 2nd display (a large flat-screen TV) perfectly in 2nd display.  For some strange reason ASUS will not all their employees to provide a contact phone number to anyone above the first level of tech/customer support or their US corporate offices.  Clearly they are not interested in resolving this although it is a simple fix.AVOID if you will ever be using this to display to a 2nd display.Overall it is a great tablet for the price.  However, if you hope to connect it to a 2nd display such as a TV or monitor it will NOT display in 16:9 size (fill the full screen of the 2nd display) but only displays what is on your table screen about 2/3 of the size on the 2nd display.  The only way to see it full size on the 2nd screen is to choose the option of 2nd display only (shows on the 2nd display but not on the table at the same time).  This means that you can't use the touch feature, but have to connect the keyboard and use the mouse.  Plus you have to look at the 2nd display to click on things.  I find this useless as it is most common if you are giving a presentation your back is to the 2nd display and you can't see it to move your mouse around and click on things.  Also, why purchase a \"tablet\" instead of a touch screen notebook if you have to use the keyboard and can't use the touch feature on this tablet.This is a known issue by ASUS but they don't point this out in any of their marketing of this unit nor do they have a fix for it and sounds like (at the time of this writing) that they plan on releasing a fix.So if you will be using the HDMI port to display to a 2nd display avoid this item and look at other brands where the 2nd display option actually work correctly.", "Date": "March 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Buy it.

I bought this because I wanted the versatility of using this as a tablet or laptop. Because it runs the full Windows 8.1 operating system, I was particularly attracted to this unit. I have not been disappointed! The keyboard works very well and is very convenient. It has one USB port which is all I really need to use to plug in a portable drive, etc. I also bought a Bluetooth mouse which I like to use, although it isn't necessary to get one since the touchpad works fine. I just find it a little more convenient to use sometimes. Everything has worked well and I am very happy with it so far. I have had it for about one week. The only thing I would mention is that you must be careful to either use the touchpad or a mouse to hit the shutdown selection because if you tap the screen to choose the shutdown option it is very easy to think that you have shutdown the tablet when you actually have only put it to sleep, because the two options are right next to each other and when you touch your finger to the screen it is easy to hit the wrong option by mistake, whereas if you use the mouse pointer you will normally be more accurate. Also, if you don't leave the charging cord plugged into the tablet when it is only sleeping the battery will drain to zero. I also have found that even though I shutdown the tablet properly, sometimes it will not boot up when I press the power button and this was a little disconcerting at first. I had to hold down the power button until the little light next to the button shut off temporarily and then press the power button again. Then it will boot up. This usually happens when I have left the tablet charging overnight. When it hasn't been charging overnight, then it will usually boot up right after pressing the power button, (if it had been shutdown properly). This has been my only concern with the unit but I am really very happy with everything so far. It is really nice to be able to use applications on this tablet that also run on Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP. I have a Windows RT tablet and cannot use these applications on it.

The only reason I took caution with the purchase is because I couldn't believe the deal I was getting.First of all, there are a few CONS: - Build quality really isn't there.  Now, I saw this in person at Best Buy, so I knew what to expect.  It's light and plasticky, but I didn't expect anything different from anything in this price range. - The trackpad is small and takes some getting used to. - DON'T EXPECT to expand your 64 GB storage with a high-speed SDXC card.Even when I plugged in a 90MBps read/80MBps write card (Samsung PRO card), the storage wouldn't exceed 24MBps read/write.  Just under 200Mbps.  That's a LOT slower than USB2.0, which realistically should top out at about 380Mbps or 47.5MBps. I don't know what kind of bus is powering this card slot, but it's NOT USB 2. - It doesn't have a terribly speedy SSD (150MBps read/50MBps write), but it's comparable to most low-end laptops, and more than adequate for most things. - RAM is not upgradeable.  That being said, the 2GB of RAM works well with most everything you'd do on it.  I put it thru a stress test, and Photoshop would crash if you tried doing anything fancy at all.  But multitasking on nearly anything else shouldn't be a problem.  Windows 8.1 was pretty well designed to be efficient with memory requirements. - BEWARE SCRATCHING THE BACK!  I would highly recommend a skin to protect the back of the tablet.  Skinomi has a great carbon-fiber skin that looks like it could be OEM on the Asus!  And they give you a free screen protector!  Don't bother protecting the base of the keyboard, it's got sturdy rubber feet.That being said, this little tablet has a lot going for it: - Cold startup time is incredibly fast! - Don't let the Intel Atom specs fool you, this overclocking little 1.33GHz processor ratchets up the speed when you want it too.  Enough to play games like Bioshock, Starcraft 2, and Civilization 5, albeit at low settings. - Speakers are nice and clear.  Not terribly loud, but I've never had a setting in which the \"adequate\" volume wasn't enough. - Keyboard dock is really pretty decent.  It's the smallest thing that I've ever felt comfortable typing on. - Gorilla Glass is a comforting thing to have, especially since I dislike the way screen protectors make your screen feel. - Onscreen keyboard is responsive and decent for quick typing...as long as you don't mind the keyboard taking up half of the screen (this is more a Windows 8.1 flaw than an ASUS flaw). - A host of ports, HDMI, MicroUSB, USB3.0 on the dock, and a headphone jack are wonderful to have.  Nice to know that Asus hasn't tried to use proprietary connectors.All in all, I have to say this:This tablet is SURPRISINGLY more than adequate!

All it took is an hour to make sure I installed all the updates before tablet could go to sleep.Machine is snappy, this is the first time intel has gotten its atom right.Tablet is plastic but you would not know it. Asus has learned from the mistakes of the past. Previous tablets allowed air between touch screen and glass. This one does not. Previous tablets had flimsy physical buttons that broke easily. This one has great sturdy buttons that are smooth and easy to work with.A lot of people did not like the keyboard for a variety of reasons. I am used to 10 inch keyboards. The only thing you need to know is that the trackpad sleeps so if you have not used it for 10 seconds or longer, the first click is a wake up touch which does nothing except get trackpad ready for use.The USB 3 port on the keyboard is a heaven sent. It makes you feel you are missing nothing from a $1000 desktop or ultrabook.Tablet with keyboard are still so light, you would have no problem using machine in your lap - couch potato heaven. Machine runs cool too, so no worries for future generations. Granted I have not played a graphics heavy game to see if it stays cool under more extreme conditions.Out of the box, 64 GB actually means 32-33 GB instead. This is not an asus specific problem. This is an industry wide problem. It is high time we are given 64 GB when we pay for 64 GB. Surely there is a way to put in enough storage in addition to OS requirements. But still as it stands, paying $350 for 10 inch tablet with keyboard and office is not a bad deal. It used to be for the same amount you got yourself a crappy low end laptop that froze so often and was too heavy and ran too hot and died in 2-3 hours unless you are near a power outlet.I am surprised with battery life.

In the spring/summer/fall, I go camping almost every weekend but wanted to continue writing. Sitting at a computer connected to the internet causes so many distractions. I knew writing while camping would really help me concentrate. The problem I had was I needed something portable to write on that didn't require power. My laptop doesn't last more than a few hours, and the only way to charge a device would be to run my car while it's charging. I started researching tablets and found this one had amazing reviews and included a full keyboard, Windows 8, and MS Office. The article I read stated the battery would last 11 hours. It lasts far longer than that with continuous use.I bought it at a store, as it was on sale for $379. When I got it home, it turned on right away. The battery was low, but there was enough for it to turn on. I charged it up. I know you aren't supposed to do it that way, but I'm an impatient rule breaker. I was surprised at how nice it felt. It doesn't feel cheap or fragile at all, and the keyboard is very nice. I saw some reviews that said people had issues with the track pad, but I don't. I can type very fast on the keyboard. My first weekend with this device, I wrote 20,000 words. I will mention that I am a woman with small, feminine hands and I find this keyboard to fit my hands well, although sometimes I fat finger the shift/enter/arrow key area. If you have large hands, you will still be able to type, but maybe not as fast as me.The battery life is just unbelievable. It lasted the whole weekend with heavy use without plugging it in. I am confident that I'll be able to take this camping with me and not have to worry about it dying.When I use this device, I feel like I'm in a movie with futuristic technology. I would definitely recommend it to anyone over any other device. It really has everything you need. If you want a small laptop for everyday things like browsing the internet, chatting, netflix on the go, etc, then this is for you. If you want an inexpensive computer for your kids, this is it.

It's very nice having the micro-sd slot, but as others have said, the card sticks out a little - I have never accidentally ejected it or anything.I have no trouble with the micro usb and micro hdmi ports next to each other. I use a micro hdmi to hdmi cable and it fits nicely next to the micro hdmi cable I have connected. It would be a problem if I were using just an adapter rather than a cable, but a cable is $6, so it is nothing to complain about. I would prefer a charge and hdmi port in the kayboard also so it could work as more of a docking station.The keyboard works nice. no backlight, but I am ok with it. It feels like a typical netbook keyboard. It is nice that it connects directly rather than via bluetooth. The touchpad on it is not great. it works, but it takes some getting used to. That and getting used to windows 8 at the same time is a challenge. The touchpad is fine for use while travelling, but if you intend to do any work with the tablet (which I do), get a bluetooth mouse. On the issue of the bluetooth mouse, I use a microsoft wedge touch mouse (by the way - awesome mouse), but I had to turn off a bluetooth option in the wifi adaptor properties on the tablet or the mouse did not work correctly. It took me awhile to figure that out.With a full size monitor, keyboard, and bluetooth mouse, this tablet has completely replaced my desktop in my home office (and I am a software developer, so that is saying something), my previous android tablet, and my laptop.

I have a problem with \"Battery mode\" or \"AC Mode\" popping up randomly, and I will get it fixed under warranty. Get a long USB cable with the tablet and the Illumishield screen protector. Without he screen protector, the tablet's screen will probably get scratched by the docking hinge as you insert/remove the tablet from the dock. It's also a surprisingly sturdy tablet. Unlike iPads, the tablet won't slip out of your hand- The back is extremely grippery. Yes, it's plastic. But if you're trying to choose whether to get this or the new iPad, get this. To get the same capabilities with an iPad is extremely expensive- $700 for the 64gb version and then a lot more for a keyboard, usb adapter (Appleport thing to USB), etc. And an iPad can't run Photoshop. As for a bad app selection, try Bluestacks-It lets you run android programs and it runs incredibly well. However, you have to force it to run in all 4 cores, or it only runs in 1 and it lags.

The windows 8.1 OS works well with the device, no major issues there.  The inclusion of a licensed copy of Office is a major +, this device combines productivity & recreation well. I'd give it 5 stars except for the fact it only has 1 usb port & the trackpad can be a little sluggish & the trackpad buttons feel cheap & they are noisy when pressed. Being that it's a touchscreen device I haven't spent much time using the trackpad however, so it can be considered negligible. The keyboard was surprisingly easy to type on as well, my hands didn't feel crowded & the keys were responsive. It also takes a long time to charge, i usually leave it overnight so I can't give an exact time frame, however, when it does charge the battery life is excellent.

Thank GOD they were out of the Notebook my husband was supposed to be getting me, even after he waited in line all night on Black Friday to get it. By the time he got to the electronics department, they had sold out of the Notebook I wanted and others comparable. I didn't want a tablet because I have medical conditions which make my hands shake, making it difficult for me to use many touch screens. I also hated his iPad (for many reasons listed below). Right as he was getting ready to leave the store, he noticed the ASUS Transformer which had something bigger sitting in front of it so it was difficult to see. He spent a little more than what he would have on the Notebook, but on Black Friday he still got a heck of a deal. And even if he had paid full price or had paid what the iPad costs, it would have been well worth the money.He had accidentally broken my previous computer so I had been using his IPad since I'm disabled and home all day. I absolutely hated the iPad! While I liked the convenience of a tablet for browsing recreationally, it sucked because of my shaking and the iPad is not user friendly for doing any true research or creating anything, I'm a Windows and Office girl all the way.The Onlive Office Desktop on the iPad never worked right and lost data all the time. The other document and presentation apps just don't compare with Office. The iPad would mysteriously lose stuff from \"Notes\" too. Because the iPad has no USB ports you couldn't easily backup data, and sending pics or other data was a huge pain in the a**! Likewise, the touch sensitivity on the iPad also sucks so I was constantly having difficulty typing. Siri doesn't understand what you're saying half the time either.Trying to get the cursor in the right place to correct things was next to impossible for me and having no arrow keys sucked.When he brought home the ASUS Transformer, I wasn't sure what to think at first. I had never heard of ASUS, and I'm not one of those techy geeks who knows a lot about brands and specs and I hate figuring out new devices. After using the Transformer for about 10 minutes, I was already in love with it. I was absolutely amazed that I can actually use the tablet even with my medical conditions. The touch sensitivity is just right, so I'm not constantly hitting things accidentally like on the iPad and I can easily tap what I'm trying to. It is thinner than the IPad, even with the keyboard attached. It's also lighter with the keyboard AND a case attached. So, it's much easier to carry around the house without dropping and easy to take it anywhere I go.It's also great because even with the detachable keyboard attached, the touch keyboard (which also has the choice of 10-key pad for numbers) is still available. You can also go back and forth between using the detachable keyboard and the touch screen. For example, I hate scrolling on a Notebook keyboard/mouse...so when I'm not using my wireless mouse, I can use the touch screen to scroll, but use the detachable keyboard to type or do other functions. It is also very easy to switch back and forth between the different programs/apps you are using.Also, unlike the iPad and some other tablets and devices, you can use the shortcuts like CTRL C & V to copy and paste, even with the onscreen keyboard. On the iPad and other touch devices, you have to VERY carefully select exactly what you want to cut or copy, (which is hard because of it's crappy sensitivity and my shaking), then tap for the cut, copy menu, then tap the right choice, then tap where you want to paste...etc, etc.. One of the hardest things for me to get used to on the iPad was having no CTRL Z.The apps install faster than on the iPad, and because of Windows and the icon size/customizable choices, your start page is aesthetically pleasing instead of just a bunch of the same size icons and same size tiny folders with icons in it. On this you can add and group whatever apps you want to main start pages, and if you're a minimalist like me, you can leave the ones you don't use as much on an \"all apps\" page, which is accessible with a simple swipe up (and can be listed alphabetically or by type).The ONLY bad thing I have to say is that we did have to return the first one because the battery would not charge at all (waiting 8 hours to find that out sucked), but I have had no problems with the second one.

For instance, I generally believe if you buy a printer that scans, you have a device that neither prints nor scans well. This is definitely a combo device. If you are torn between a laptop and a tablet, there are definitely some advantages to this device.- It is fast for tablet.- The touch screen is responsive.- The screen is of good quality.- You can use some PC programs, such as the included Microsoft Office, and even play the PC version of Minecraft.- It is lightweight and portable.What to consider if you are in the market for a laptop:- The screen size is only 10\". While this might be great for a road warrior, I find using a laptop with a screen this small somewhat awkward. You could also argue that a smaller screen uses less battery life and is better for travel.- For the price, you could have a laptop with a larger screen, a DVD drive, a larger hard drive, faster processor, and more RAM. In other words, you have chosen to sacrifice speed for portability.- The keyboard is surprisingly good, if slightly stiff, for a sub-standard sized keyboard.- The trackpad is terribly stiff, even after many hours of use. I only use it in laptop mode if I have a mouse plugged into it.What to consider if you are in the market for a tablet:- This looks less slick than other tablets of this size in this price range.- You are using a full version of Windows 8.x. At this time, the Windows app store is frustratingly small. If you plan to use this as a tablet, please take a look at the apps available for Windows. Hopefully the market place will grow by leaps and bounds, but right now there isn't much there. Obviously you will not be able to utilize apps available from Google Play.Overall, I am delighted with the speed of this device, especially considering the hardware it is sporting. I have not had any issues with speed. The Windows 8 learning curve is definitely high at first, but that is not the fault of this device and will be a problem with any full Windows bases touch screen device you purchase.The packaging is lovely and reminds me of higher end products.

It truly is a full windows laptop in a tablet form-factor.I've been using my 64GB model for over a month now.  Among the things it can do that an iPad of any flavor cannot:*  Print to my 5 year old deskjet, either wirelessly or via USB*  Play/Burn CD/DVD/BluRay (with an external drive)*  Run VMWare and/or Hyper-V*  Connect to my Wacom digitizing tablet*  Run full-blown Photoshop and Illustrator*  Run almost any legacy Windows application*  Play most Steam games*  Accept MicroSD without an additional ($$) adapter*  Recharge from any MicroUSB charger (though possibly slowly, depending on mA rating of charger)*  Connect multiple peripherals simultaneously via USB hub*  Connect USB thumb drive without additional adapter*  Connect second screen via micro-HDMI and have extended desktop.*  Will still be able to accept updates from 2+ years from nowThis is off the top of my head.  Among the \"warts\" this device has:*  Plastic constuction (you'll likely want to get a case for it anyway -- all tablets are FAR TOO easy to break)*  Not a retina display.  Not even remotely close. (But let's face facts: a really pretty screen only goes so far when your other funcationality is severely limited.  For me and many others, this is a decent tradeoff.  This screen does not suck.  It's not not uber high-res like the iPad)*  The manufacturer is Asus, and they have historically HORRIBLE post-sale support.  (this really is the worst thing about this tablet and the one that gave me the most pause).Having used Windows since the earliest days, I have been turned off by Windows 8 and the aggravating Metro UI.  With the release of Windows 8.1 and the ease of jumping between the deskop UI and Metro, this tablet does a great job straddling the funtionality of a true laptop and a tablet.  After a small amount of getting used to, I'm growing to like Windows 8.1.Many claim (correctly) that iOS has significantly more apps than any other tablet platform.  While this is true, how many apps does a person need?  1 million?  100,000?  The ability to install/run almost any legacy Windows app on this tablet is HUGE.While I'd still recommend an iPad to parents and anybody else to avoid getting tech-support phone calls, I'd eagerly recommend this to anyone reasonably computer savvy over the iPad.  Comparitively, the iPad is a beautiful, well-built, well-supported TOY that simply can't compare in terms of versatility and potential for productivity.

Lockwood", "ReviewID": "R3CFES7C70BLI9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Anyone who converts video or music generally will want to always have access to a \"real\" PC.  Also, a person who wants to backup music or video files to an external USB drive will more than likely want to have access to a PC.  This can serve in those capacities nicely, as well as convert to a large tablet to take to Starbucks or to just sit at home on the couch and browse the web.  The Windows 8.1 Metro style with its \"live tiles\" is easy to get used to and very nice looking.  I really have grown to like it, and have installed the Flipboard app, and several free games from the Windows store.  (The Kindle app is already installed and works very well.)  Plus there is a start button and desktop that looks very much like Windows 7 for the old school folks.  The Asus version I got comes with a license key for MS Office for Students and Home.  That's a nice plus if you need to work with Office documents, but I haven't installed it and probably won't.To sum up:Pros:-Lower price than most other large tablets-Operating system guaranteed to be updated for many years-Great battery life at ~12 hours-Included detachable keyboard-USB port for external drives, DVD burners or mice-Windows Metro, which includes very well designed apps for Bing news, health news, sports news, as well as a large collection of 3rd party apps such as Flipboard, Kindle, many popular games, etc.-Storage memory can be upgraded with a micro SD card, up to 64 gigabytes in sizeUses the standard micro USB cable for chargingBluetooth connectivity for use with speakers, bluetooth mice, etc.Free cloud storage thru MicrosoftFree cloud storage thru AsusCons:-Cannot play the latest/greatest PC games...for that you would need a desktop PC or a gamer notebook, either of which would cost a lot more than this device.-Battery cannot be removed by the user.-System memory cannot be upgraded any further than the included 2 gigabytes-Only 1 USB port, and that is on the keyboard-Camera is only 1.2 megapixels...obviously designed for Skyping but not for picture taking!Extended review:For the most part, this device will serve my needs for a Windows PC, plus a large format tablet.  Most of us have been reading the dire warnings for the upcoming security issues for PCs using Windows XP.  Both of my PCs run XP because I never had a reason to upgrade to Vista or Windows 7.  I know my current PCs don't have the capability to run Windows 8, so I was concerned. This PC solved that problem for me, as well as answered my need for a larger tablet.  I had considered an Ipad Air, but didn't want to pay $600-700 for one with sufficient storage that I wouldn't feel cramped.  I also considered an Android, but I have some concerns about security on those devices, plus the cost of a good one is up there with the Ipads.  And, this one has the keyboard included!Concerning security on Android: I have several Android devices and I love them except for the fact that the version of Android (or derivative version of Android) that each of them operate on are probably never going to be updated any further.  That means that all the security features being written into Kitkat will not be made available to those who have these so-called \"legacy\" devices.  This has been discussed on several tech web sites and is a serious concern.  To me this is the biggest problem with the practice of leaving it up to the device manufacturers (or the phone service carriers) to decide when/if my phone or tablet will ever receive any upgrades!  When a device is new, it may receive incremental upgrades, but simply put, there is no guarantee that it will receive even that, let alone a major upgrade such as from Jellybean to KitKat.  I also have a Kindle Fire and I have not seen Amazon come out with any security related updates, and no announcement seems forthcoming.  (You can invest in a third party software, the discussion of which is out of the scope of my review due to varying opinions about the effectiveness of such products verses something written into the operating system itself.  Keep in mind that you can also use a third party software with this Windows 8 tablet, thus having even more protection.  The best solutions seem to involve setting up a VPN (google it), which can be problematic depending on the device.)  Anyway, back to my review.  :)The OS on this PC will be updated by Microsoft for a number of years.  I want to emphasize the importance of this!  The Microsoft EOL schedule shows when support for each version of the Windows operating system will cease.  According to the EOL schedule, Win XP will not be supported after April, 8, 2014.  Considering that it was released well over a decade ago, I think that is more than fair.  The _Windows 8_ lifecycle is this: mainstream support will end January 9, 2018, but extended support will end January 10, 2023.  This means that for 4 more years, the whole operating system will receive updates, and for 9 years, there will be minimal support for updates.  Can you imagine a 4 year old Android or Iphone continuing to receive any OS updates at all?Talking more about the hardware:  Along with the included keyboard, other advantages to this device are the USB port on the keyboard that can accept a USB drive, mouse, etc. just like any other notebook PC. The speakers have good sound, the screen is bright and clear and has a great viewing angle.  Advanced core power-saving features provide extra long battery life, published number is approx. 11 hours.There is a slot on the tablet part of the device that will accept up to a 64 gig microSD card.  And, because we are talking Windows, you can store ANYTHING on the SD memory card...where Android only allows you to store pictures, music and videos on the external storage unless you root the device, and Apple Ipads don't even have an external slot!However, all is not perfect:  The screen resolution is below that of a comparable Android or Ipad tablet, but it is still 1366 x 768...not bad, but not even close to retina.  You would have to test the device and see if this is a problem for you, for me it was not a problem, in fact I'm generally at least 14-16 inches from the screen and at that distance, the screens on all these newer devices generally look the same.Also, the touchpad is extremely sensitive and must be disabled if typing on the included keyboard for extended amount of time.  If I leave it on while typing, my thumbs will contact it while I'm using the spacebar, and the cursor will end up getting moved to another spot on my document.  Very annoying if you are a touch typist!  Disabling the touchpad is easy, just hit the fn key plus the f9 key to toggle the touchpad on or off.  If you would prefer a mouse over the touchpad, you may install a wired mouse (or wireless mouse with USB dongle) in the USB port, or you can purchase a stand alone bluetooth mouse which will interface very nicely with the built-in bluetooth.  Going this route will leave the single USB port free for other uses.  I have an old Kensington bluetooth mouse that I have tested and it works fine for this.  Or, you can simply reach up and touch the screen instead of using a mouse at all.  The touchpad should have been made a little smaller so that there could be more room between it and the spacebar.  It would still be usable.The Bottom Line: I made this purchase after a lot of thought about the pros and cons of Ipad verses Android verses Windows.  I needed a machine that could do everything...be a \"PC with keyboard\" as well as a portable \"tablet\".  In my opinion, this device, even at $100 more than what I paid would serve those needs better than any other device currently available.  This is because of the included keyboard, flexibility with external devices thru the USB port, and micro SD slot for added storage.  Throw in the promise of full updates to the OS for the next 4 years and we have a winner in the longevity, flexibility, and usability categories.By the way, this whole review was typed on my T100...I can't imagine doing this on any tablet that didn't have a keyboard...Edit to add the following info from a comment to my review from D.M.Cook:The Micro SD slot will recognize a 64GB card. It may even do 128GB. They're a little pricey at this point, so I've not tested. Also, you can use the Micro USB charging port as a USB port with an OTG cable. With that, you can then connect any peripheral you want to the tablet itself (or, heck, connect a USB hub and connect multiple peripherals.)(I changed my review to reflect the ability to use 64GB card, but put the rest of his comments down here for ease of readability. -V.Lockwood)", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "great little laptop/tablet", "Author": "Wellywood", "ReviewID": "R1NTWF7JEKAJ9B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Was nervous getting this after many reviewers complained about issues with Windows upgrades.

My favorite is the all in one shopping app. The PC/tablet/notebook hooked up to my wireless printer without even needing to be set up.  The device comes with over a terabyte of cloud storage for all of your photos and music so virtually nothing goes on the tablet aside from what you want to keep there.  You can access the information from any PC or phone also.  Internet is very smooth and fast using both Internet Explorer and Chrome. Syncing your contacts is a snap, just setup a Hotmail account and import your contacts from Gmail or wherever.. I installed MS Office 13 Professional and it runs just as fast as my desktop.  Battery life is amazing. I can't think of a complaint and I typed this with my on screen keyboard!

Kudos to ASUS on design!  My only warning is that the laptop is top-heavy unlike previous generation laptops since all of the hardware is on top, so be careful not to let it tip!  I tried a wireless mouse on the tablet and it worked flawlessly.  I purchased a netbook sleeve to protect the device on trips since it is similar in size.  Also, I forgot to mention how cool it is that this device uses the same charger as my phone to charge, which means I can use my backup battery pack to charge it too just like my phone.  Amazing.

I can be fully charged in the morning and be at less than 50% at the end of the day with little to no use.  I checked some user forums and other users who experienced the same problem recommended updating the bios. However, I couldn't find any simple step-by-step instructions. I was able to figure this out from the forums as follows:1. Go to [...] Select \"Download Now\" for drivers, bios, etc.2. Select Model Manually. Select \"Notebook\" under Product. Select \"T100 Series\". (Do not select \"Eee\")3. Select \"T100TA\" and \"Windows 8.1 32bit\"4. Select \"Bios Utilities\" and download Windows BIOS Flash Utility onto your Asus T100. This will show up as \"WinFlash\" in your applications.  You will use this app to install the BIOS update.5. Go to BIOS and download \"BIOS 220\".  This is the latest version. This can be done on the Asus or a desktop PC.  It will be a zip file, so you'll need to unzip it before installation.

Small, light and with a VERY long battery life. I could watch 4-5 hours of movies on the plane and still have plenty of battery left. The dock connection between tablet and keyboard is solid and I am not afraid that it will be damaged when you pick it up by either part. Keyboard should have been made with a little bit heavier plastic or aluminum. It's not bad but has a little bit of flex to it. It is a budget combo so it is not perfect. For the price it is very good. Some people complained about the size of the bezel around the screen, I find it helpful to hold the tablet without fear of falling out of my hands. Surface of the screen and the back of the tablet is a major fingerprint magnet. As one other reviewer said Asus needs to talk to the guys who made kindle and make theirs too. Hopefully ASUS will work on their sleep mode because it does use too much battery (about 5-10% per day) comparing to my Mack and Kindle. I did update computer and windows software. Not a huge drawback but something to improve on. Keyboard works well even with my large \"sausage\" fingers. I mean it's not a full size but beats trying to type on the screen or one of those fake keyboard.  I bought couple mini SD cards for extra storage. Comes wit about 35GB free space on the main drive after all updates. I just find it easier to keep my music and TV programs on an SD card. Software has some glitches but, Hey it's Windows, wouldn't expect any different. No issues with blue screens, no starts and such seems to work well for the last month or so. It is stupid that IE acts different and opens in a different screen when opened from the desktop screen and from the windows 8 \"app\" screen. That should be integrated and go to the same place. All in all it works well, has a almost full windows office minus outlook (too bad Microsoft is not making enough from office to include outlook with it ).

Although another aside, many of the Windows 8.1 apps work terribly.  Its amazing how badly sometimes.  They are beautiful but never flow smoothly like iOS and Android apps do.  Anyway, with Office 2013 and full windows, the machine is perfect for someone who just wants to do the basic functions of Windows from time-to-time, but is also an excellent transitional device for those who realize that we are probably all (or most of us) are travelling into the cloud and having a slow (and slower everyday) local running device with endless updates and security problems.

Instead, I picked mine up at my local WalMart.  Since it is again available, I will go ahead and post a review.  I read all the reviews for the Asus T100 before buying, and like most others, I felt it was a great value except for the annoying, shiny, fingerprint-magnet surfaces.  So I bought the Skinomi TechSkin for it.  I had absolutely no problem installing it and had it on, pretty close to perfect, in under 30 minutes.  I do have a lot of experience installing similar products though.  Right now, the screen looks kind of grainy, but that should clear up completely within a day or so.  The result is excellent.  The Asus T100 looks so much better, and NO fingerprints ANYWHERE.  I am very happy with both products.Also, other reviews, and videos on YouTube, mentioned problems with the keyboard and trackpad.  I am happy to say that mine had none of those issues.  It might be unclear to people, as it was to me, that the bottom two corners of the trackpad are \"mouse\" buttons and depress slightly to click and select.While it does take a long time to charge fully (USB) it was usable right out of the box while plugged in.  i have used it heavily for several workdays now and have gone home each day with at least 30% charge left on it.I have very small hands, so typing on it is actually much easier for me than a standard sized keyboard.  I love it.  But I can see where it would be more difficult for someone like my husband.I have loaded it up with software, and as usual, have many things open at one time.  The Asus is keeping up with no noticeable lag in performance.The screen resolution is noticeably less than some other products ONLY IF YOU PLACE THEM SIDE-BY-SIDE.  Alone, it just looks like a nice, crisp, clear display.I was so excited about this product because it ships with full Windows 8.1 (which I love so far) and Office Home and Student 2013.  I was particularly excited about OneNote as I've been using a knockoff but compatible app on my iPad.  I am very disappointed in Office 2013 and OneNote in particular, as they've adopted a very austere look, much like iPad's OS7.  I hate them both.

Wow!", "Author": "Shannon Miklos", "ReviewID": "R24Z9K3VRKRSZK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I highly recommend this computer. And I'll tell you all the reasons why. (If you're a MAN with big fingers, than MAYBE not for you, some men w/big fingers don't adjust to a small keyboard, that's just anatomy.) I love my Asus! I purchased my Asus in early Dec. of 2013. Now over 4 months later I can honestly say I am beyond impressed with it. (After being so happy with this I bought an Asus MeMOPad HD 7-Inch tablet for my 11 yr. old son's birthday because I knew the Asus product wasn't going to let him or myself down, and he loves his!) Is there a learning curve due to windows 8.1 and a small keyboard? Of course, but they are slight! If you don't have the patience to learn a new system and work with a small keyboard, then stay with a traditional heavy regular laptop. I was researching computers for about 3 months before my purchase and stumbled across this one day. I wasn't looking for a 2-in-1, but this Asus computer was rendered from a search query w/what i was looking for, so I dug deeper. I read reviews and learned from them, like understanding when I bought it to charge it for a solid 10 hours before touching it. (For the battery life you get in return, I would of waited longer!) I was expecting a small keyboard, and read after a week or two of use that you get used to it. And I did. It's SO light weight you can take it anywhere! And it does everything I need it to!  It has a full size USB, and I was even able to download the drivers to use my old HP printer. The computer has wireless printing, but my printer doesn't, so I just plug in and print. Some people complained about sound, but seriously? Would you expect stereo sound from a phone? I bought a small (can carry in my purse) wireless (can be connected w/wire too) Pyramid speaker, I run it through the Bluetooth, and viola, all the sound you need! The BIG selling point for me? Microsoft office home and student 2013 edition free! (Mine was downloadable, but FREE). I am a grown woman who is in her first year of school. I knew I would be in need of a computer and Microsoft office Word for my English class this semester and this computer has allowed me to do everything I need and more. Any issues I have run into have to do with IE, and are issues of IE's integration with windows 8.1. The technology is just ahead of the browsers. There are a few keys on the keyboard which can cause you to jump somewhere unexpectedly, but that's because they are \"window\" keys and such. Once you're used to the lay out, it's not a big deal, and if you're in word and hit something, just use the undo option, no big deal. Some people complained about the plastic glossy top. If it was any kind of metal, the machine would be heavier. I'll take the portability over looks thank you. Some people complained that it looked/felt cheap. Seriously? I have a light weight computer that does everything I need, I couldn't be happier! I'm a mom, a part time college student, and part time server, I'm not in fashion contest. And I still think the machine looks great as is. And yes it's a touch screen, you're gonna get smudges, A quick swipe w/a cleaning cloth takes care of that. Any screen no matter how fancy is going to leave behind oils from your fingers. If you're in the market for a full functional computer, with office, that is lightweight, has amazing battery life, and detaches to be a tablet to boot, than this is a great find! Yes don't forget it's a tablet too! The screen isn't loaded with mega pixels, it's not super Hi-resolution, but it still has a great look! And you can buy a micro HDMI cord and hook it to your TV if you want to! There's just so much you can do with this computer! I wanted a touch screen laptop, and wasn't even sure if I would find one that had what I was looking for on the tight budget I had to deal with, and this little 2-in1 came along and took everything I thought I had learned from my researching and blew it out of the water. Asus isn't offering a sub-par product at a sub-par price. They're offering a quality product that can do what many others can do, for a lot less in many cases. That's the way to make a name for yourself and create a strong, loyal, customer base, something way too companies have lost sight of,or in this day and age have never had. As I said, I already bought a 2nd Asus product for my son, and will definitely by from this brand when another product is needed in the future.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Tech support problem", "Author": "IceMan", "ReviewID": "R31SF72199KOI4", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I like the t100.

Very happy with purchase.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3BAVQDN5YO6ZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Here's the deal, if you want something light that runs windows 8.1 with office and a keyboard all in one... then look no further. This unit was not purchased at Amazon, but I just wanted to share my experience to help those that are interested in it.I was looking for a desktop laptop replacement that I could easily transport from work and home. This seemed too good to be true, but it has lived up to it's ability. Now I say ability, because you have to know what you are buying.1.CPU: It isn't going to be the fasted thing since it has a 1.83 processor, but it isn't going to be slow either. The quad-core processor isn't an issue. It actually works just fine. I run office, photoshop CC, Illustrator CC, Indesign CC with no real problems. They all work fine. I use this now as my primary device, no more bulky laptop.2. RAM: 2GB RAM is plenty for windows 8.1 using just office and the browsers. It does max out with multiple apps open and large applications like photoshop as well. I just make sure I close unused apps and programs when in my bulky ram eating programs. No big deal, for this price you get a lot, we are just spoiled with the \"we want it all now\" mentality we have grown into having. A 4GB version would make this thing amazing.3.Video: Video playback is great, youtube playback and micro hdmi out work just fine.4: Keyboard & touchpad: Not the greatest, but it has one. The fact that it is included with this price is amazing! I actually connect a usb keyboard and bluetooth mouse to this for my heavy work. All other browsing and fun is used in tablet mode. It does drop the bluetooth connection with the mouse after a period of time, but remains paired. FN F2 keys applied twice turns on and off airplane mode, which reconnects my mouse. No big, don't know if it is the mouse (HP x4000b *known for connection issues) or the tablet. Either way, it is quick to fix the connection and I don't have to go through many settings to get back to work. This also works for a dropped WIFI connection, which I don't have issues with dropping connections like I've seen others.5.Battery: It lasts a long time. I don't have defined hours, but I can use it all day at work just on battery and bring it home to play with and charge at night. Or... use it all day at work while plugged in and bring it home to play with on battery for the night. You won't be displeased with it.6. Overall performance: I am very happy with this product and do recommend it if you are looking for a light production tablet/laptop device. I am an IT/webdesigner and it works great for me. For those doing heavy RAM eating work like video editing... the 2GB won't be enough, heck I max it out just in Photoshop. I just watch what is open and it suits me fine. Daily, I run Photoshop, InDesign, Wamp, Office, Notepad ++ and even remote into other computers. It works for me, just know it won't be a top performer... it does the job that I need it to do.As a side note, I did shop the Dell Venue Pro 11, Surface, Transformer Android version (forget T#, think is is T701 or something like that) and ultrabooks in the persuit of the \"biggest bang for the buck\". All others priced way too high for what I wanted to spend. This is what I chose and am very happy. I was skeptical and worried that it would be junk, but am glad I made the leap. Also, this may seem fanboyish and possibly fake for my hype... it's not ... all I can say haha.

Love that this has Windows 8 (x86) not Windows 8 RT.  So this means I can install any other .exe (executable) file that would work with my desktop.  The docking keyboard is a nice feature complete with USB 3.0.  Windows 8 is a challenge to learn but once you hit the acceptance phase of Win8 your good to go.  Pretty \"zippy\" for an Intel Atom Quad processor.  Office 2013 comes preinstalled but is really hard to manage with touch, I recommend a mouse or the touchpad.  Battery life is impressive, I play games on this most of the day and use it for work and I haven't killed it yet during the day but ready for the charger when I get home.  Plays lot games, shocking I know, but do not expect BF4 or anything like that.  Got it play Plants Vs Zombies, Pain Killers, SimCity4 and a few other Steam games have worked but all graphic settings need to be on low.  Once you see the Windows Store you will be glad you got the x86 version of Windows and not RT.CONS:  Never seen Windows 8 blue screen of death (BSOD) till I got this.  Gotten it three or four times now for an IRQ conflict which is really baffling since there is hardly anything to this tablet.  The back of this bad boy get really hot when playing a game but is fairly cool when just browsing the web.  Still having a few connectivity issues, have to disconnect and reconnect numerous times.  Freezes a few times, put it to sleep and plug it in and that's all she wrote.  My biggest complaint about this is the keyboard.  No additional battery and the left and right click on the touchpad feels and sound very cheap and the touchpad flakes out for a second or two.Overall I love this thing.  I don't blame ASUS for any issues with this other the touchpad but Windows 8 is a challenge to learn.  Having x86 Windows on the go is great.  MicroSD card sticks out a bit and gets bumped outta its socket from time to time but it allows you to double your storage while on the go.  I got this and ditched my ASUS Transformer TF700 for this and I miss the simplicity of Android but this makes work easier; being able to transfer files from my work laptop, to home desktop to my T100 helps me out greatly.

The battery life and performance is fantastic for any laptop, but truly amazing for such an inexpensive one.  It functions well as a tablet also, but is a little awkward in portrait mode given the widescreen aspect ratio.  Windows 8.1 is a remarkable operating system that functions well in both the multi-touch and laptop modes.  Also, it's easy to choose this over the Surface RT as it offers full Windows 8.1.  This means you can run full desktop applications and gives you access to desktop services such as Steam, iTunes, and Spotify (without paying for the premium verison).  This is a huge advantage over the iPad or Android tablets as well.  Plus, unlike other tablets, Windows devices run the full desktop version of the web including flash video and animations.  It even has the full version of MS Office (Home and Student)!My only criticisms would be the \"just okay\" build quality and cramped keyboard.  I also wish the performance was a bit better for desktop apps and games, but it's acceptable given the low price. Finally, the tablet apps available in the Windows store are lackluster, but that should improve with time.

Larger yes, but superior in every other way.Cons:- I wasn't impressed with the speed - it was actually quite slow even when only running one program.- keyboard is really cramped, and I have very small hands, so sorry for you big fellas :) I wouldn't call this a laptop. It competes more with the iPad/Kindle Fire crowd.- Will often not come out of hibernation easily, when you press the power button, and that has nothing to do with the battery life. It just doesn't always respond to the power button. Had to fiddle with it for 2-3 minutes several times to get it to come back on.- Charges incredibly slowly- immediately began having issues with it saying my hard drive was full (notice this doesn't have a large hard drive in general). however, i had not put any files on it, other than a handful of pictures (50 or less) and few apps, like facebook.Note: when I complained to the seller, I was told to do a factory reset and I confess I just sent it back at that point. B/c really? it's brand new and I already have to do that. I let it run the first setup seamlessly, so there was no issue with me somehow intervening in or interrupting it's normal first time setup process. I think there's fundamental issue in the software.Pros:- detachable keyboard designs is good. light weight, without feeling cheap. Screen is bright and colors are good.Summary: I'm not sure why you would buy this. If you want a real laptop, you can get something much faster, with a touchscreen, with more space for the same price through Dell. Yes it will be larger, but again - you're wanting a laptop, which I presume you want to type on comfortably and want a larger screen for reviewing things. IF you want a tablet, then again, superior products are available for less or about the same price. I have an ipad now through work, and it is also a superior experience to this in terms of the lightweight, keyboard and general tablet experience.

I fell for the marketing campaign and despite not being able to find one in a store to actually look at, I ordered two of them from Amazon. One for me and one for my partner.  My bad for not immediately opening it up and using it, but I waited until Christmas day and then only had one week to play with it before embarking on several months of overseas travel. I've been using it as my primary computer/internet connection for three months now.  Admittedly, I seem to be a slow adapter to Windows8. I hate it and find it clumsy and illogical to use. Of course, that's not Asus' fault but what is Asus' fault is the fact that my screen spontaneously jumps from one window or program to another. I'll be in the middle of writing an email, for example, and 'poof' I'm dumped out of email and find myself staring at the desktop.  Thanks to the way windows 8 is set up, it takes several clicks to return to where I was in my email. Then, 'poof' it happens again. This is a regular feature of this computer. Jump and dump the user from where she wants to be to somewhere else which requires several clicks to recover from. As mentioned, this happens while in email, it happens when surfing the web and when moving between pdf and word documents.  Another problem is the on/off button. It's not responsive so you have to keep repressing it, holding it down and eventually it may work. Or, it will embed itself into its socket and refuse to pop back up so out come the tweezers to pull it out so the machine can be powered up or down.  Then, when powering down, the machine will turn on the camera. What??!! I didn't ever even use the camera so why is the little camera indicator light coming on only when the machine is turned off? It took me several days to realize that this was happening. The good news is that there is now an explanation for why the battery would drain overnight if not plugged in. The bad news is that it has continued to happen every time I shut down for 3 months. The fix is to wait until the machine has finished the rest of the shutdown process and then press that finicky on/off button again and hold it for 5-10 seconds until the camera light also shuts down. Then the battery is preserved. I will give the battery its due, when in use it does have a long life. I can use the machine for pretty much all day without having to plug it in which is good because, as others have noted, the recharging cord is so short that you have to work right next to an outlet in order to have the machine plugged in. That's a fairly minor annoyance since the battery life is pretty good. (Note, I found that the cord is the same as the one for my kindle paperwhite which is much longer so I use that one if I need to work on the computer while it is plugged in)  That said, I have noticed that when I am not plugged in, the screen will dim for no reason - touching it or typing does not prevent or reverse this dimness. It will brighten up again on its own when it is ready. Those are the most compelling problems I've encountered. Other reviewers have covered much more thoroughly the other pros and cons of this machine. In fairness, I will note that my partner's machine seems not to suffer from the same afflictions that mine does (it is also used much less frequently) but my father bought himself one of these too - after seeing ours at Christmas. He returned his within a week because it had the same on/off button problem that mine has. He bought something else and is very happy with it. I'm going to replace mine as soon as I get the chance. Other reviewers have noted that this is a decent machine for travel, sound quality and light use but is not recommended to be used as your primary computer. I'd have to agree - in my opinion, it is too frustrating for frequent use.

Peavey", "ReviewID": "R1JHJQ45BOZU4H", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update (5/16/2014):Have had enough issues with the T100 for it to lose another star down to 3.  There are 3 main problems:1) Random periodic BSOD.  They do not happen too often but started a few months ago.  About once every few weeks I get a BSOD, which is annoying, but not device ending as it is so infrequent.2) Random turnoff/slow wake up. About once every few days, I will open up the tablet and the screen will stay dark.  Sometimes after about 20-30 seconds it will wake up to the login screen (battery is practically fully charged usually when this happens, so not a low battery issue).  Sometimes it wont come up at all and I'll just have to hold the power button down for a bit to do a hard/cold boot.  Once again, not the end of the world, but a minor annoyance.3) The dock.  Still having issues where it is always disconnecting and reconnecting.  As a tablet a keyboard is not a big deal, but the problem is this is a hybrid notebook (Asus themselves classify it as a notebook).  It can sometimes take me a couple minutes of moving the screen angle around to get it to recognize the keyboard is docked so I can use it (this is without disconnecting the screen, just moving the angle of how far it is opened.  I RARELY use the T100 without the dock connected and leave it connected 99% of the time.  It is definitely secured in there).  When I am typing, the small vibrations/movements from my typing can sometimes disconnect the dock and I will hear the annoying beeping sound of connect/disconnect several times and be unable to type.  I will then have to mess with it again until it lets me type.The 3rd problem has grown to such an annoying extent that I am updating the review and messaging Asus support.  Will update review again based on results of Asus support.Original Review (1/31/2014):I picked up the 64gb version of this Windows tablet/laptop during black Friday and have had a couple months of use to review it.  Bought it mainly for entertainment/internet/reading usage for a trip with plans to use for school as e reader.Pros: Great battery life, gaming capable (long as not a top end game, seems to handle what I throw at it, but heats up a bit if play for an extended period), full version of windows and Microsoft office, screen quality is good enough for regular reading (using it for all my textbooks) and has a microsd expansion slot (on tablet) and full sized USB 3.0 port (on the dock's side).In docked mode, do not have to worry about tablet heating up if you leave the dock sitting on cloth as you would with a regular laptop.  All the components are in the tablet/screen part.Also the one good thing I like about the dock is it holds up the tablet well and is well balanced.  Whatever angle I set it at, it stays at and doesn't tip over or anything.  This works well when using it for reading and you do not want to hold it long.Cons: Keyboard dock is sturdy and well built, but wont stay connected.  if move the 'laptop' around or touch the screen, will often lose its connection.  For many usages this is not too bad, but the full sized USB port is on the DOCK, not the laptop, so if you have any USB devices connected, it will lose it's connection as well when the dock loses its (not horrible in most cases, but potentially damaging depending on what you have connected).Also the dock connector is not a standard usb connection of any type, which isn't essential, but does probably limit the chance at it receiving many 3rd party options for docks and long term product support.  (keyboard is a little small, though expected for tablet docking.  I wouldn't mind the option of buying a larger dock/keyboard though so I could use a full sized docked keyboard instead if I so wished)And last con, which hopefully changes over time, is that you cannot install other operating systems on it or really boot from USB at all.  My first experience with uefi, but seems to take extra work to get it to boot anything else at all.  When I first got it, first thing I wanted to do was to use clonezilla to make a backup image of the ssd, but I never could get clonezilla to boot.Rating:  Really, at the price point and quality of the product, I would give it 5 stars if not for the Dock's connectivity issue.  I do not know if this is a manufacturer defect or product defect, but it is the only thing about this tablet that really bugs me.Recommend to others: I would definitely recommend this to others on a budget.  I think for tablets I definitely enjoy having a full windows OS on it and hard to beat at the price point.  If can afford a Surface Pro/Surface 2 Pro I would say go for that, otherwise this is a great second choice.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Quality deal on Hybrid", "Author": "David Morales", "ReviewID": "R2LIYO8ALFC4BD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Solid build.

I have purchased a separate adapter, which comes with a permanent and longer cable, for use while at home.  I have also purchased a longer USB cable with the appropriate connectors for use with the charger provided with the unit.  I will carry those items with me in when traveling.  The unit, after an initial 24 hours charging, cycled on and permitted setup with no problems.

The bay trail tablet was very smooth and works well, but unfortunately the initial one that I got was a lemon.  I went to the MS store near my house and they replaced the tablet due to the issues I was having with it.  I think Asus has a great product and would have given it 5 stars if they (Asus) did the following.Cons:1. Make the screen 10.6 or 11 inch and make the keyboard less cramped.2. QA is a huge issue, Asus needs to grow up and deal with the fact Microsoft has the Surface.  Asus is a excellent company that makes amazing products for the average consumer.  The lack in Quality Assurance is inexcusable, too many lemons are floating around and Asus needs to address this problem right away before they tarnish the Transformer product line.3. Microsoft needs to work harder with their partners, update pushes should be centralized.4. The feel could be better and if not metal at least hard rubberized back so the user doesn't feel like they are going to break it every time they use it.5.  The tablet should be rubberized so it can act as a built-in cover.Pros:  Many....just a few listed below1.  Asus packaged office 2013 student edition...2.  The non lemon version was smooth and very responsive.3.  Even though the resolution is a little lower than I would have expected, still looks great.4.  sound is surprisingly loud and clear.5.  light weight even with the keyboard.For the price it is an amazing product.  For those who are still having issues, before you return it to the place of purchase, and if you have a Microsoft store near by, have them take a look at it.  Its worth it, considering 64gb bay trail tablet is hard to come by at this price point.

The action is fine (chicklet keys), though obviously a bit cramped. No number pad which is to be expected (impossible on this size).* Windows 8.1 - this can be a bone of contention. I know many don't like W8 but in the Windows tablet world it's your only choice. And really, it's pretty good. For basic service I actually have begun to like the Metro interface, which works wonderfully in a touch environment (though it fails quite a bit in a mouse-driven system). I like the apps and the way they display news, travel, food and other topics, making it a really nice way to get the basics done. Going beyond that may require using desktop, which isn't as easy in touch, but you've always got the keyboard.* FULL Version of Office 2013 Home and Student.

If Microsoft had produced this tablet when Windows 8 launched I'm sure it would have been much more successful.The screen is not particularly high resolution but it is very clear, bright and has good color. I use my tablet for watch a lot of movies while traveling and it is great for that. The keyboard is excellent with good feel and travel on the keys and it is surprisingly comfortable to use considering the size. The trackpad is small but functional - although clicking seems to be limited to certain areas - it's not a highlight of the device. The way the tablet connects to the keyboard is excellent. It seems very sturdy and, when docked, it behaves just like a laptop. It is also easy to dock or undock.The performance has exceeded my expectations and it seems quite snappy as long as you do not open too many applications at once. My Windows Experience Index score is 4.1 which is not bad considering the 2 GB of RAM and Atom processor.There are three things I would change if I were designing this. I would offer a version with 128 GB of internal storage as 64 GB is not much once Windows has taken its share (which will only grow as updates get installed). The other strange thing to me is that there is a metal plate in the keyboard to provide the weight to keep the tablet from tipping backward when docked. Surely it would not have added too much to the cost to add a battery as the extra weight and extend the usage time of the system. At the moment I get 7 hours of continuous HD movie playback at full screen brightness, with speaker output and wireless etc. all turned on. I expect this can easily be extended to 8 hours with power optimizations but another battery in the keyboard, instead of dead weight, would have been useful. It should also have a GPS receiver built in.Despite these minor shortcomings I find that I can take this on trips and it is able to replace my laptop and its charger (for real work), an Android tablet (for watching movies on flights and listening to music while driving), and my TomTom (by using an external GPS receiver).

Ako", "ReviewID": "R1PZ90ZG3G02A0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I originally purchased the ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR with 10.1-Inch Detachable 2-in-1 Touchscreen & 64Gb of memory for my 9 year old daughter for Christmas. Amazon & the Microsoft Store sold it on or around Black Friday for $299. I never heard of the Asus T100 at that time but noticed it sold out quickly. I wait listed with Amazon & received it for $349 just before Christmas- a punctual delivery thanks to Amazon. I thought this would be a good computer for my daughter, whose school primarily uses Apple MacBook Pros & just started adding Microsoft Surface Pros. She prefers the version of Office with the Windows OS for most of her home/school work (after using both, I independently came to the same conclusion- it's a matter of taste I suppose). I mean what can you expect for that kind of money?After sharing this tablet/laptop for over 2 months, I found that my assumption was wrong. This is no toy. The Asus T100 is a great road warrior machine, with good battery life, Windows 8.1 OS, & a student version of Microsoft Office. This is much more suited for road work than a Chromebook because internet connections are uncertain in travel. There was a learning curve with 8.1, but it is short especially since it is configurable to boot to a more classic desktop (buried in settings on the Charm bar) & can quickly switch to metro if desired. I disagree with the critics/haters of WIN 8.1. It's all about choices & flexibility with the T100.My old Asus road machine was the Asus 1000HE netbook. I liked the form factor for road work, but it lacked performance with the old sluggish Atom processor. The T100 uses a much quicker & more efficient quad core Atom. I believe it beats Celeron & behaves more like an i3. Not bad for a road machine rated for 11 hours of battery operation. However, the 1000HE does have some advantages over the T100. I can easily swap batteries, which is useful on long flights (e.g. NY to Hawaii with stops). I can replace/upgrade memory on the 1000HE mobo. I can replace the hard drive on the 1000HE. The T100 cannot do any of those things that the old 1000HE can! I suspect that the life of the T100 will be limited to those items that cannot be replaced- a disposable electronic. However, this is not exclusive to the T100. Competitors to the Asus T100 have the same limitations. I don't think these features should have been sacrificed just to keep it thin. I don't mind a road machine that is a little thicker if it is more capable & reliable. I also wish that it has a non glare screen like the 1000HE which is more desirable on a road warrior machine. I also would not throw the T100 around since the case is plastic. My 9 year old daughter has used it with no problems so far, but this machine is not designed for a gorilla or Neanderthal. At this price it is designed to be replaced, but it is a fraction of the cost of an Apple or MS Surface Pro. So far so good though.Useful accessories: I purchased a HooToo\u00ae HT-UE01 3-Port USB 3.0 HUB with 10/100/1000 Gigabit Ethernet Converter for the T100 for $29, along with a Micro HDMI to HDMI Cable For Asus Eee Pad Transformer for $5, a Poetic SlimBook Case for ASUS Transformer Book T100 for $20, all from Amazon. All of those accessories work well with the T100. A 64 Gb micro SD memory card is less than $50 on Amazon & adds that much more to the existing 64 Gb for a total of 128 Gb, but it is slower than memory soldered on the mobo. I have retained my old netbook bag & mouse from the 1000HE, which fits the T100 perfectly & so did not have to purchase another. If you ever buy one of these, don't ever forget to update the BIOS- not difficult on the T100.My daughter & I are very happy with the Asus T100. I wrote this review on my daughter's T100. I noticed that as of 22FEB2014, Amazon is selling the T100 for $75 above the Asus list price of $399. I presume they are in short supply.

A nice hybrid laptop-tablet at a nice Price!Then like November I discover the ASUS Transformer Book T100TA-C1-GR 10.1-Inch Detachable 2-in-1 Touchscreen, It was interesting first at all by the price and things comes with in.After investigating and read a lot of reviews and reports I thought this really going to be the table I going to buy, and I did it!Get started!Isn't perfect. My came with four dead keyboard letters from the fabric (both alt's keys, ''\u00d1'' and key were suppose is it (I'm a Latino speaker) f9 and f3 both also dead). But fortunately aren't necessary keys.My worst fear was that I read that the BIOS could get crash when I update the system. Fortunately didn't happened. (Two weeks and hopes it won't happened ever.)THE GOOD:A nice combo convertible laptop-tablet with decent characteristics inside at a reasonable price. Brought it when the price was the lowest! 349 to low.Comes with keyboard with in the price. It\u2019s not that amazing keyboard, but works and helps. Better than nothing!! Right now I'm writing this review with this transformer book keyboard.Lattes Intel atom Quad core inside, let me play 1080p movies, some hi-res games, and other middle range multiple tasks easily with no notice.Mostly OUT-IN Ports needed in daily life. Micro-sd, audio in-out jack, Micro USB-charger-port, Micro HDM. Crispy but only one 3.0 USB Port.Original full windows 8.1 (isn't pro but do the work) with full Office Home ed. 2013.Kind of loud stereo speakers, not that high but lit higher considering it\u2019s a tablet.A 10 hours average battery life. Gets awake with me all day.Light and very slim.Rocker keys.Bluetooth 4.0 and wireless N.The Bad: fortunately are minor things.This weird keys board. The size doesn't bother me, it is the location strangely keys positioned! (Weird short right shift key and FN KEY get me writing errors)  NO ESCUSES ASUS! I already have a 10'' laptop and it keyboard (standard) is quite good. Yes, I get used to, but the experience could be better, please. And why only one USB port? I have to make miracles with it. Other side came with four letter keys dead (already say it).Sleepy touchpad.8 hours charging for get 10-11 hour of operating battery life. You must be start to think charge this thing when you are sleeping or you won\u2019t get full battery experience.This short USB charger multiple use-cable. Is only like 2 feet I think. It won\u2019t let me charge far away from an outlet!Finger prints everywhere!!!Only one camera. No rear.No full HD resolution screen, decent quality. Sunlight reflector, but brilliant enough and good for price.Some reviews said Bios get crash! My DOESN'T (that is very good, thanks god).Not for massive storage. With all necessary programs still left only 25 GB. So is more recommended this version rather the 32 GB version. You must start thinking put all you massive data on some wireless external HD perhaps.Last words:As already said it. Is not perfect, but for the price you get a good entry-level laptop with good adds. Some things have to be improve but in generally it really good comparing with other laptops convertibles equal range (this got better processor and cost less considering comes with keyboard).

Ok for short docs but I wouldn't want to do a 20 page paper on this without using an external keyboard.Also its a Microsoft machine so they want you to sign in to your Microsoft account to use just about any app on the T100. Drives me nuts. No I don't want to sign in just to see a calendar, thank you very much, and I dont want to store my Word documents on the 'cloud' or anywhere other than my own device, which fortunately, is still an option.Contrary to what I previously thought, MS Office is included, which has Word, Excel and Powerpoint. The Microsoft Key is in the box. Good thing I didn't throw that out. This takes the T100 out of the realm of 'toy' and into the area of 'usable light weight low power cost saving work machine'.

I didn't think much of it at first, the layout works, the touchpad works, the usb works. Shortly after using it I noticed that the touchpad was raised. Sure it pops right back down making that tape/glue like sound that I'm assuming it's held on with, but lo-and-behold after about 5 minutes the left corner has popped right back out!  I contacted amazon after debating if this issue, mainly cosmetic, was worth the hassle of a return. The only way to get the keyboard replaced is to send back the whole unit. So that is what I'm doing. I'll hopefully update with good news once the transaction is complete. (From my research this doesn't seem like a normal issue, the keyboard was probably assembled on a Friday)My advice is to make sure the touchpad is set in the keyboard before you start making it your own!

It needs a different texture on the back so it won't slip out of the hands. As a tablet it is still lacking many apps that are on my Galaxy Note 10.1 for me to completely switch tablets.

Saying I wish it had another inch or two (of screen size and width for the keyboard) led to the infamous \"That's what she said\" and snickers at same.  Ah, juvenile humor ;-)Seriously though, I bought this item sight unseen, something that I rarely do.  I had been coveting this item for a while, but had also been wishing a bit for an alternate product, a Dell Venue 11 Pro tablet.  I really went back and forth a good bit before purchasing, and almost snagged the DV11P but didn't thanks to lack of local inventory and a lack of follow-through on a promised \"trade-in\" offer at a competing retailer.  I went to the local retailer specifically to look at the DV11P (and possibly trade-in an older Windows XP laptop that was supposed to yield some credit in trade) and without having one there to see I went back to the office determined that I would probably purchase the DV11P.  That was the plan at least, until I dug through the reviews (here at Amazon) more and found myself questioning just how much I wanted that item and whether I should instead consider this item more instead.The more I read the reviews, the more I was convinced that while the DV11P would have been nice, it would also have been a bit of a gamble and on top of that it would have meant spending more to get the keyboard and/or dock to go with it if I wanted those items (and yes, I would have wanted them).  All told, I would probably have dropped 2x the cost of this item on a DV11P and the associated accessories compared to what I invested here.I should note, I do own a Dell Venue 8 Pro, along with an ASUS VivoBook X202E (and I have gotten one of those for wife 2.0 who enjoys using her's) and a host of other devices that I could use that also includes a Sony VAIO Fit Series 14-Inch Core i7 Touch Laptop which is running Windows 8.1 (now the updated version of same).  Given this range of devices, I'm still -- to borrow from the U2 song a bit -- not finding what I'm apparently looking for, a nice two-in-one tablet device that would have say the screen size of the VivoBook X202E mentioned above, while also being easily broken down into a separate keyboard and touchscreen tablet.  Really, if the VivoBook X202E was a convertible device, it would be just what I think I want, but then again it would likely leave me wishing that it was perhaps a bit skinnier and more compact so it would be easier to carry around :-/  D'oh, just can't seem to find my own happy place with these devices.After getting this device and getting a look at the keyboard, I can see why some of the others here have suggested the keyboard is a bit disappointing.  The smaller shift key on the right side of the keyboard is frustrating.  A little more width to the keyboard would have fixed that (I think).  It also would have resulted in - hopefully - slightly large keys all around.  It would have taken much there for me, but just a little more would have been nice.  What is here is usable, just not quite as much as I'd like (there's the opportunity for another 'that's what she said' comment to spring forth :-/ )The screen itself is nice.  Again, perhaps a little under-sized for what I had expected and hoped for, but not bad.  It is nicer than the LCD display (non-IPS) that the X202E has.  That particular screen is one that is best seen directly (head-on).  Viewing from the side offends the eyes of some that are easily bothered by such things (not that I notice it that much, but I know a few individuals that are bothered by the side viewing angles when looking at that screen, so I do recognize it can be a problem).  That is not at all a problem with the beautiful IPS display that is included on this tablet.  The display on this item looks good from virtually any angle (except, obviously, from behind the display :-p )The resolution is close to the same as I have on the DV8P, but in a larger screen that is easier to read and easier to touch the gadgets on when I'm trying to control things back in Windows 8.x's desktop mode.Having the touchpad on the keyboard dock here gives a user full mouse control where desired and eliminates any concern about having to lug additional accessories around as I might (and do to some extent) when I'm carrying the DV8P around.  No need for a mouse, no need to carry around the stylus.  No need to carry around a keyboard (such as the Microsoft Wedge keyboard that I have to use with that device).I wish that this device had about 2x the storage capacity (128GB would be pretty nice, compared to the 64GB, with roughly 37GB of user space available) built-in, and I also wish it had a bit more memory included, though Windows 8 (or Windows 8.1) runs well enough in the included 2GB of built-in RAM.I would note that the build quality is good for this device, perhaps into the nice range, though there are a few things to mention.  First, when I moved the MicroSD card that I had been using with the DV8P over to this device I found that the MicroSD card sticks out a bit and easily nudged to the point that I have concerns I could lose the memory card by carrying this transformer book around and simply brushing up against the memory card as it sticks out on the side of tablet.Similarly, I'm a bit disappointed/frustrated that the \"power button\" on the tablet is recessed more than I'd like making it a bit harder to press and use.  I expect that the power button should be easier to make use of (it is very easy to use on the DV8P and most other tablets that I have used).  It can be used on this tablet, but it is not something that I can just reach up/back and press lightly.  Instead it requires a bit more effort to insure that I'm hitting the button and making good contact with it.The plastic/carbon fiber type case on the back of the tablet is a virtual magnet for oily finger prints (as is the IPS display on the tablet).  It has a bit of a slick feel to it and might leave you concerned that you'd let the tablet slip through your fingers more easily than you wish.The keyboard sits sturdily enough when the tablet is snapped into place.  The tablet also snaps out easily enough.  When snapped into place, the tablet portion stands easily and offers enough ability to adjust the pitch to make it easy enough to view the screen while typing or using the touchpad.All told, I like this device, but would note that I would admit to a bit of buyers remorse.  Really, if the screen and keyboard were just a little bigger, I would probably have called myself ecstatic with my purchase.  As is, I would say that I had some thoughts that I might wind up doing as a friend does and let this one go at a bit of a bargain price so I could instead invest in another alternative.

I spoke with Asus tech, and I had to do a hard reset on the system... same problem so the unit went back to Amazon for replacement. On this, Amazon just rocks!  2 days later I got the replacement.So I am in luck this time. Everything came up and was working fine. Then I started to install software, which I quickly realize I have made a poor choice picking the T100TA H1. Software is defaulted to install on the C: drive, which is only 32GB. It didn't take long until I have to conscientiously pick and choose what to install.  There is a work around to force installation to a microxd card, in my case, it's is E:.  If I edit the regedit to force installation to E:, then the computer doesn't recognize programs that were installed in the C drive. So I either choose to install on C or  on E:, but not both. I am sure that some Windows gurus out there may have a solution how to do installation on both C and E, but for now, I will just have to settle with installation to C.  Hindsight is that I should have opt to get the T100TA C1 model, which has 64GB for the C: drive.  Then adding a 64GB microxd card for data would have been much better.The 500GB HDD in the keyboard does come handy for storage, and this is what attracting me to get the H1 model. Again, I quickly realize that I don't use the keyboard as often as I would do with my laptop.  Well, after all, I bought the system for the tablet... so duh on my part!  The HDD is a mechanical disk, and sooner of later, I am going to drop my T100, and I will loose my data.  So I decided to open up the keyboard and replace the HDD with an SSD. Now everything is faster, just a tad bit, and no more hearing the winding up noise of a mechanical drive. I suspect that I will get a little more battery life as well using the keyboard.I am getting used to the small screen, but overall I enjoy the idea of being able to do work and play anywhere without lugging my laptop around. Windows 8.1 is fast, but requires some major re-learning.  I am so used to Windows 7 that it has been frustrating at time not knowing what to do in Win 8.1. And one thing I can't stand is the lack of the briefcase in Win 8.1, so sync to my desktop was a problem until I found a work around.  Don't know why Microsoft just doesn't leave a good thing alone...The keyboard is small, no doubt about it, even for my small hands. The right shift key is next to the pageup key, which I constantly hit it... I found my cursor jumping to place I didn't intent it to, then I realize I hit the pageup key.... it takes some getting used to... but it is a good compromise for portability and weight. I do feel that the keyboard is somewhat flimsy... very much like a toy keyboard. Time will tell how well it holds up to constant use.The overall unit is well made. The tablet is a magnet for finger prints... so I use a case instead.  Since the tablet is touch type, I found my finger prints all over the screen; frequent cleaning doesn't help because I keep touching the screen... ha.. one of my pet peeves about dirty monitor... oh well, welcome to the tablet world I suppose.So in summary, if I would do this again, I would get the T100TA C1 model instead. It would have been nice if Asus would offer the 64GB version of the H1, then that would have been the ultimate portable transformer book... speaking of that, I wonder if Asus would be willing to upgrade my tablet with 64GB???", "Date": "May 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hate The Keyboard1", "Author": "Bernard Duchesne Jr", "ReviewID": "R3TU8L5O695HO8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Have been using the100TA for 5 months.

I tried the T100 as I was attracted by the keyboard.  However, it turns out to be too small for serious typing.  As such, I will use a full size keyboard when at home and hook it up to my 24 inches monitor.  While I am on the go, I will not bring it with me as well, so I will say the keyboard is right now quite useless to me.  What's more, it makes my purchase a stupid decision as it is the keyboard that prompted me to buy.  Its weight also makes me reluctant to have it on the go.  Right now, I am using the Toshiba for most of the time.  Have it on the go and hook it up to a wireless keyboard and monitor when at home.I will recommend this product to those who REALLY need the keyboard and have small hands.For those who need light weight Win8 tablet, go for the Miix2.For people like me, who need a portable tablet for occasional Office work, while wanted to avoid hassle of syncing the data when at home, I will strongly recommend the Toshiba Encore, or probably the Acer one (I have not tried it though ).", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome tablet, keyboard dock was... sketchy", "Author": "TJ Wagenknecht", "ReviewID": "R51OEWQ8PTWYE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this tablet through my school, who bought it through Amazon.

Note to the ladies: can't use this keyboard with fingernails!My irk - the irk that lessened this review by a whole star - is the placement the micro USB and the micro HDMI ports.  Which rocket surgeon thought that putting them 2mm apart was a stellar idea!!  Did anyone actually TEST it with adapters??  If you need to power the tablet while using the HDMI port for, say, a monitor (so I don't actually go blind), you will need an HDMI adapter CABLE (read: expensive), not just the adapter (read: cheaper).  The adapter doesn't fit when the power cable is plugged in.Since it only has 1 (full-size) USB port I bought a bluetooth mouse that works like a charm.  The screen is crystal clear and the sound from the speakers is not bad.  It's a shame they don't yet make the 64GB SSD with the 500GB HD in the keyboard.

The good is that for the price, compared to the Surface Pro 2, you more or less get a similar product and specs. The size is a bit smaller than expected just by looking at the photo (take a measuring tape or ruler and draw it out), but it's light and sturdy.What I have not seen in the reviews is that it's sssslllllloooooow. Maybe it's just my IP, but all other devices in the house work well on the network. Maybe it's the version of Windows 8 that came pre-installed, because non-browsing actions also have a hitch in its giddy-up. Also, clicking the tablet into the keyboard is a bit cumbersome.

Yay!  I am quite computer software literate, but do not know much about technical aspects.  I think this tablet has areas which are less sensitive to touch than others.  Microsoft chose to put the x to close a program or window in the same area where one could get to the \"command bar\" that pops up when swiping from the right of the screen.  On the tablet, when I try to close the app (or program as it used to be called), the command bar pops up, instead of closing the window.  The popup keyboard is in the all the time. Since I am not a touch typist, I have to open and close the keyboard all the time to see what I am typing.  That is annoying.  Surely the OS can shrink the program or website to eliminate this overlap?  Also, a right click with a mouse on a mistyped word is NOT replaced by a tap on the word, because that brings up the keyboard.  For some reason re-sizing is not available for all websites as it is in my phone.

Another issue was the \"on\" button would not work sometimes. And most recently the charger gets very hot, so I cannot leave plugged in for enough time to charge it.I like that the battery lasts 11 hours, but it does require a long time to charge, no problem if you are consistent with using it during the day and leaving it plugged in all night.I do not think you can turn it on while charging though, but maybe that is this particular issue I was having with the \"on\" button.I looked on the internet and there is a way to \"reset\" the start by pressing two buttons at once, and the reset worked once but after that it did not work.Anyway, I really liked the size, battery life, touchscreen/netbook and windows 8 features, but I was hoping not to have so many little issues on the first month of usage.

Check the battery using the Windows 8 battery diagnostics log, and found that the battery capacity has decreased from 31,000 mWh to 22,000 mWh. At this rate of battery deterioration, this unit may not work after 2 years of ownership. Other than the battery issue and low available usable drive space, this unit is great.

Windows updates when first setup will take a long time. Some folks are talking about issues with the tablet dying in the middle of updates. And the advice to change the updates from auto may hurt some non techies. What I did was set up power plans that did not let the tablets sleep, shut down the drives, or turn the screen off.  It is simple just go to Control panel, then looking at it with large Icons click on Power options. The default is balanced or power saver. Just set up a custom one that does not allow any slowdown when using it for updates or long scans.  Here is a link to how to do that with screen shots.[...]Then just remember that Microsoft releases their updates on the second Tuesday of each month and next will update on May 13th. Just remember to switch your power plan back to balanced or however you prefer it for battery and plugged in for day to day use, then remember to switch to your never turn off power plan when plugged in just before long scans or updates.

It's not as if it's a load bearing structure in your house or something...It doesn't have to work that hard. Mail, the odd document, social media and download video clips off the GoPro. So why not an iPad or cheap Android tab? Simple - if you want to run specialized windows applications (in my case engine ECU flash and GPS mapping software) then you're really only left with one choice for a new touch device, and that's something that runs full Windows 8.1. The T100 handles all of this flawlessly. Apart from the Windows 8 learning curve, there's nothing I've yet found that I don't like about this one. Yes the 64GB internal storage that comes with it is a bit on the small side, but I didn't get the T100 to be my primary storage device. The 64GB MicroSD that I bought to go with it gives me plenty enough for a few days worth of GoPro clips, and there's always USB flash drives if even that runs out of space.Battery life is fantastic. It'll go all day with light to moderate usage. One thing to note though - if it's asleep in a bag and gets bumped around a bit (common on the excuses that pass for rural roads in Australia) it can open to the point it wakes itself up and sits there draining the battery. If you're going to put it away for a while and not look at it, hibernate it or shut it down. The 1 minute of your life you lose waiting for it to start back up is orders of magnitude less annoying than a dead battery, believe me.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is, well, it's not a Surface Pro is it? And it would have been nice to have the USB in the side of the screen half rather than the keyboard half.

I am a long-time iPad, Mac OS X, and Win 7 user.  This was my first exposure to Win 8.  While IMHO Windows 8 leaves a lot to be desired, this tablet definitely makes the best of it.  The construction has a solid enough feel for the price range.  The tablet feels sturdy and not too hefty (probably twice the weight of my iPad Air), but it handles well thanks to the curved back and large bezel.  The keyboard feels cheaper and has a cheaper tactile feel.  The touchpad is loud to click, but a tap works too, which saves the noise if you are in a quiet environment.  If you are in a meeting, that touchpad click could be disruptive (yes, it's that noticeable).  The responsiveness of the touch screen was very good, as is the accuracy.  I had no trouble touching article hyperlinks, on CNN for example, and the web site came up quickly.  The resolution and clarity of the screen are fine, comparable to an iPad 2; and I found the color to be very rich and clean (albeit I am not a graphics pro, so for the casual user at least, the color is fine).  The tablet separates from the keyboard base easily and without missing a beat, and connects back up just as easily.  The touch screen is quite a fingerprint magnet, as is the back of the tablet, so you will need to carry a small tablet cloth with you to keep it clean.  The hard drive is limited in size, but should be adequate if you will be using this computer for word processing, spreadsheets, email, etc.  Battery life while playing  a movie, browsing and doing some email and work processing was about 4.5 hours.  Not too bad.  The charger cord is a short USB cord with a separate wall unit.  You will need a longer USB cord if you want to have the tablet plugged in while using it.

During the initial set up I didn't find windows to be too intuitive, it left my fingers scrambling just to find some menus. But after fifteen or so minutes -- I fell in love with Windows 8 (W8). Not because W8 is a looker, the tiles are kind of annoying. But because it offers a great amount of freedom, something that you truly have to work for on a Mac. W8 runs smoothly and the Asus Transformer didn't stutter as I kept tabbing up the windows, trying to cause it slow down. It finally gave way once Photoshop was opened and I started to play around with it. But normal to even moderately advanced workloads were handled without an issue.Enough about W8, let's talk about the build quality. Floored! No other way to put it. Asus' tablet doesn't feel cheap. It's not exactly high grade but you do get a wonderful feeling of stability. Snapping the tablet onto the keyboard requires just the right amount of pressure and the button releases smoothly. The keyboard is OK. If your hands are big you may have an issue; my husband grew frustrated, he's also 6'5' and has paws for hands, but I found it easy to use. The spacing is a bit tight and the trackpad ... well, there is room for improvement there, at times it just didn't work, but it was more hit than miss. As a tablet, it is more than serviceable, the screen is not the brightest, but it does offer great clarity and color. And my swipes and taps registered on their first attempts.Now, for what I really love about this tablet - OFFICE! It comes with a license, you can get to work right away on it. Just use the Office Card License that's in the box and you're good to go. I had no issues pairing up my printer with my tablet, I transferred over a few files and printed without any issues. I also wrote this review using this Transformer! The Transformer reminds me of those netbooks that were all the rage a few years back, I have two. I really liked them. They allowed me to get work done and still not be weighed down. This truly takes the netbook to another level, it's just easier; lighter and more fun to use. That has to do with the tech involved. Apps have become a necessity. Microsoft's store is lacking in that department. But there are some that are truly useful, you may find some that are just fun to have around.Asus' Transformer is a near excellent piece of hardware and a true bargain.

Amazon arranged UPS to come and picked it up, and I got the credit back. However, I went ahead and did a second purchase the following week as I did want to have one that works. I was more careful this time. BIOS is version 304. I charged the unit for 11 hours, though it didn't reach 100%. The next day I started it anyway, the power was about 95%. I selected not to automatically perform Windows update during initial setup. Tested every apps displayed, installed a couple of new apps from the Store, tested. Tested Mail, Desktop, internet connection. Installed iTunes and Chrome, tested. Activated MS Office and tested all modules. Then manually selected updates to perform. While doing this, the battery was being drained even when connected and charging. I had to power it off once in a while (Charging was so slow!) and come back. The power didn't reach 100% either the second day. I let it charged overnight the second night. The third day the power reached 100%. After a few days charging seems getting 'normal'. I was able to create a recovery copy on a 8 GB USB drive. I registered the unit today. I am keeping this one.

Short Comparison to Dell Venue 8 Pro", "Author": "S. Catalin", "ReviewID": "RIB15002E7OEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Update:Battery problems are now solved. I have disabled the automatic installation and downloading of Windows Updates (only leaved notifications of new updates) and tinkered a bit with the Keyboard power options in Device Manager (disabled the \"allow this device to wake up computer\" in Properties for the HID Keyboard). Applications that continuously listen for notifications may also play a role (try uninstalling Facebook temporarily). While this is not something that non-IT people knows how to do, it fixed my problems and now the tablet drains only 15% over 3 days, which is great.My rating is now 5 stars for this combo. It's really great !After buying a Dell Venue 8 Pro for myself, I also bought an Asus T100 for a close member of my family and I can use it any time I want. I know many people are cross-shopping these two tablets.Build quality is significantly higher on the Dell Venue 8 Pro, but the Asus T100 feels very good too, especially for the price. The T100 screen glass feels like plastic instead of glass initially, the screen surface feels hard to glide figers on. But it becomes useable after some time, after some finger grease settles on it. I think it is missing some special coating specific to high-quality touch screens.The screen viewing angles are nothing short of amazing. Crisp text and basically no color distortion at any angle. Very good screen, even if not extremely bright. It also enters a \"reading mode\" when you launch a PDF file or in other (not sure which) conditions. The screen colors get warmer in that mode.Unfortunately, the T100 has some significant shortcomings (besides its obvious advantages like a large screen and free keyboard dock): battery drains much faster at idle/sleep, even after flashing the latest 220 BIOS and the latest Windows and Asus updates as of 12/28/2013. This happens especially when docked to the keyboard. While the Dell Venue 8 Pro can stay in connected stand-by for like 5-7 days, the Asus T100 drains in 24 hours if docked or ~2 days if removed from dock. It also drains faster with usage. Don't get me wrong, the battery life with use is very good, it can be like 7-10 hours. But overall something is wrong with the T100 battery life at this time, hopefully it's fixable via some updates, but I am afraid it may have something to do with hardware too. It's not easy or cheap to implement connected stand-by with low battery usage. The charging time is quite slow too, making you keep the laptop with the charger connected most of the time.Keyboard on the T100 feels very good, keys are a tiny bit smaller than on the previous \"netbooks\" but insigificantly so. You get used to them and become productive in 1-2 days. Much better than a touch screen keyboard. Trackpad is as good as any notebook trackpad but only after you uninstall the Asus SmartGestures software and flash the 220 BIOS.The Asus T100 docking mechanism is very good and stable, with one shortcoming of a too narrow maximum screen tilting angle. Sometimes you wish you could tilt the screen more.All in all, if the T100 fixes its battery and stand-by problems it's a near perfect convertible tablet/laptop. But right now I cannot fully recommend it because it is not mobile enough due to the battery draining issues. Instead I would recommend the Venue 8 Pro with the official wireless keyboard case (unless you absolutely need a larger screen).", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "A very good tablet/laptop, if one did not get a defective unit.", "Author": "NJ buyer", "ReviewID": "RXUNL1GFWR2F2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Although I got this product on Nov 15, I held off giving a review until I have used it for more than a month.Having read of other reviews in which the tablet crashed during set-up, I was very disappointed when my crashed during the windows update and wouldn't reboot for half an hour. Finally, after several attempts, the machine rebooted and I immediately restored the factory default settings, updated windows, and DISABLED all ASUS updates. I've never updated the BIOS, nor will I take such a risk.I have been using the machine for 5-6 hours on weekdays and even took it on a 2-week trip to Mexico.

That said, I believe this is a wonderful little 2-in-1 and it's a good product for many people. I've had my Transformer Book for a couple months now and so far I really love it, so I'll try to lay out some of the pros and cons for you.Cons:-Doesn't have a ton of internal storage. 64gbs isn't a huge number these days, but you can expand with an sd card.-Processing power could be an issue if you work in certain fields, but in my daily use as a student I've had zero problems so far.-Doesn't come with wacom technology like the Surface and some other tablets do. You can use a capactive stylus with it, but all that's going to do is mimic your finger. If you need pressure sensativity for drawing, say if you're an artist, an aspiring architect, etc, this may not be the tablet you need.-Camera. Not the highest quality camera I've had in a tablet or laptop, but not horrible. Also, no back camera.Pros-Price.-Battery Life! As long as you make sure to power down or put it to sleep, this thing will hold a charge forever. I'm interested to see how the battery holds up over time, but thus far it is awesome.-Decent Speakers. Nothing to write home about, but much better than some laptops I've had. They are loud enough to watch a show on Netflix or whatever else I need to hear. I do prefer my headphones for music, though, just for maximum quality.-Lightweight, especially without the dock. This thing isn't heavy to begin with, but if you're going somewhere you don't want to lug any extra weight you can just leave the dock at home and the tablet is ready to go.-Size. This is obviously a matter of pure opinion, but I think this is a good medium size.

About two days after i received it, it would not come on no matter what i did. I looked online and eventually found that it suffers from an issue called something like deep sleep mode and requires that you hold the power button for fifteen seconds, let go, and then hold it again until the asus screen pops up. Now that i know the trick, there are no problems.Another thing is the outrageously, and sometimes comically, short charging cable. It can not be larger than three feet, which may sound like plenty but can be quite a problem when you have to rearrange all of the people sitting at the table with you so that you can be close enough to the outlet to plug in. I have moved more giant tables, and rearranged whole groups of friends and laboratory partners just to be able to charge it. The good thing is the battery life is incredible so if you charge it the night before you likely wont need a charger. I have used it on a full charge heavily throughout a day starting at 8 in the morning and still had 30% of battery life left at six at night. Having said that, I don't know if there are extensions out there but if so, get one!Another thing, which is to be expected with such a small device, is the small size of the keyboard. you get used to it, but it is different and requires practice. I also have large hands.This is not a computer that really can be used comfortably on your lap as it often feels top heavy and threatens to fall backwards. There is no issue in the slightest if you leave it on a desk or convert to tablet mode. Im not saying It can not be done, as i often do use it on my lap, but it feels unnerving, and you kind of have to keep your palms on it at all times to keep it from falling backwards like a scuba diver.All together this is a great little device, and i highly recommend for students who will be carrying in backpack as it is remarkably light and small and fits perfectly in a backpack (or purse i would think).", "Date": "March 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love this tablet", "Author": "Housing Guru", "ReviewID": "R1U4Z9JGRNS7Y6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I use this everyday for business and wow!

I turned off the Bluetooth radio as I had no intention of using it, and soon found out that the standby battery life didn't like that.  If you turn off Bluetooth, the standby mode takes almost as much power as being on, in my experience.  I pulled it off the charger after being plugged in all night and went to work... and came home to a laptop/tablet that didn't want to turn on.  Plugged it back in and it came back to life, with a flat battery.  With Bluetooth enabled (regardless of you intentions of using it) the standby battery drain is merely disappointing rather than appalling.The wireless frequently went south, requiring a reboot to recover.  No amount of asking it to reconnect would do.Sometimes it just didn't wake up, and I had to hold the power button for 10-15 seconds a few times to get it to come back to life.  The broken wifi and failure to wake up were very disruptive to getting anything done at all on the tablet.

But the reason I really like it is that I don't use it much.What i really wanted was a fully functional Win 8 transformer that i could use at work.  I wanted it to be responsive and not lag too much.  I also wanted to be able to type on it as needed.  Lastly I wanted it to run all day on a single charge.  It does meet all these criteria, however a few of the functions aren't that good:1) The mousepad is really bad.  I mean it's barely usable.  This isn't so awful because the screen is touch enabled but the screen also does not always register touches.2) The system lags sometimes.  It isn't terrible but it is bad enough to be annoying.  If you're used ta a very responsive Android device you're going to notice the lag.3) The app store is laughable...there are almost no Win 8 apps.On the upside:1) It is a truly fully functional Win 8 device.  No limitations--anything you could install on a desktop you can install here too.2) The screen pops off easily and you have a tablet.3) The screen is nice, sharp, bright and clear4) It comes with MS Office which is obviously nice.Overall I'd say this is a good limited use device.  i don't think you'd want to buy this as your primary laptop because it can be awkward to use on a lap, or in bed, etc.  However, for people who want a Win 8 device for meetings at work it's great.  You'll be able to do things like install Skype, or GoToMeeting or anything at all that works on Win 8.  It also has a very long battery life so you don't have to worry about running out of juice.  The little tiny mousepad it comes with is very awkward to use and I find it very frustrating.  Also, the 'aim' on the touchscreen isn't great even after calibrating it twice.

However, after going through all the set-up instructions, my keyboard did not work after my initial log-in to Microsoft.  The tablet worked great and I am getting used to Windows 8.1.  But if I wanted just a tablet I would have bought one.  I discussed this with ASUS support personnel once via their on-line chat where they went through several steps, refreshed my computer, etc.  (NOTE:  I am not a computer  person,  more like \"turn it on and type\".)  That did not work.  Called and talked to an actual person who tried many things, but still no go.  So, I was told to send my computer to ASUS (free shipping both ways) and they would look at it.  Got it back a week later, but they keyboard still would not work after my initial log-in to Microsoft.  This was frustrating because I knew the keyboard worked because I could always type the initial log-in.  So, after scrolling through Amazon, ASUS, and Microsoft, forums/reviews, I finally saw something about a filter.  By the grace of God, I remembered stumbling across this somewhere in the set-up stuff (I think where the Narrator part is) and I was able to turn off the keyboard filter.  Finally, after 2+ weeks, I was able to use the keyboard for my Office programs.  YEAH.Another issue I have is that the instructions are so limited.  As I said, I am not computer savvy, and I need more detailed instructions in WRITTEN form in a booklet.  I did not see anything in any instructions I saw, that addressed the issues I was having.  It was such a simple thing (turn off the keyboard filter), but I ended up sending my computer to ASUS and almost returned it.  Also, the camera photos are not very sharp/clear.  Nevertheless, I love the portability and flexibility of this product.

(I will post this same review in Amazon under each device.)1. ASUS Transformer T100 hybrid tablet/notebook \u20282. Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 10.1 Tablet\u20283. Google Nexus 10 tabletI also looked at an iPad Air.  They are way overpriced.  And I still have a grudge against Apple for the 2012 hard drive recall they had on our 27\" iMac.  It was a total disaster.  We didn't lose any data but it took weeks and endless phone calls to get it running right again.After spending a day getting used to Windows 8, I thought the ASUS might be the one I was going to keep.  I actually only tried it for two days.  Early on day three I shut it down only to have it remain on the \"Shutting Down\" screen for an extended time period.  So I powered it off.  Apparently, my bad.  Subsequently it would not reboot into Windows, reset or repair even after talking with ASUS Tech Support.  They asked me to return it to them for repair.  I declined and returned it to Wally World.I liked the ASUS.  It was attractive but a fingerprint magnet both front and back. And it was more difficult to use than Android.  The two issues that bothered me most were the lack of a Swype app and the complications of dictation.  The best Swype-type app in the Windows Store is TouchPal.  It ain't that good.  First of all the virtual keyboard is large. Your finger has to cover a lot of real estate to enter characters.  Also, the word prediction accuracy sucks. Windows-supported dictation was not that accurate, so I had to go into Google to dictate.  This was not nearly as handy as being in a Google operating system to begin with.  I use Swype and dictation a lot.The mentioned issues relate to Windows 8 not the physical unit.  I liked the ASUS unit enough that I discovered they make several similar models running Android.  After checking these out I found they were either running old versions of Android or cost a couple of hundred dollars more than the two Samsung models mentioned here.  So, that ended that.It was hard to choose between the Nexus and the Galaxy,  Both are made by Samsung.  I waited several weeks to see if a new Nexus 10 was coming out but to no avail.As far as looks go, the Galaxy is very thin and attractive.  In my opinion it is as nice looking as an iPad even though it has more plastic.  I had the white one so fingerprints were not that visible.  The Galaxy gets compliments for its narrow bezels.  However these are really a functional negative. They cause you to touch and activate stuff on the screen accidentally quite often.  Makes me suspect the iPad has the same problem.  There are a lot of complaints about the large area of sensitivity for the three built-in keys at the bottom of the Galaxy.  However I thought this was minor compared to the narrow side bezels.  (You can probably negate the side bezel problem by putting the unit in a folio case. It could give you more to hang onto.) The speakers are on the top of the sides and are easy to cover up when holding the unit.Though made by Samsung, because Google's name is on it the Nexus is first in line for Android updates. It has already downloaded the latest Android version, KitKat.  It will also be the first to get future updates since there is no manufacturer software OS overlay to wait for.  It is pure Android--no bloatware.  In terms of specs, the Nexus blows the other two units away.  The broad bezels may not be as attractive but they give you something to hang onto without accidental screen touches.  The Nexus' rubber-like coating on the back is better for grip and not a fingerprint magnet.  Less bling but more practical. The Nexus' speakers are on the on the front, the best place.Even though I did not keep the Galaxy and its specs are much less impressive than the Nexus, I found it perfectly satisfactory for my needs.  I do mainly Web browsing, Email, some text and spreadsheet documents and a few non-graphic intensive games. I bought all of these units from local big box stores.  The Nexus 10 was $400 and the two Samsung units were only about $30 less.After considerable researching of portable Bluetooth keyboards, I ordered and just received a Kensington KeyFolio Pro 2 Universal Case and Keyboard.  I bought this from Amazon and will review it when I have had it for awhile.  So far this looks like a terrific and attractive accessory  I will probably keep the Nexus in the protective case without the keyboard most of the time.  I will use the keyboard when I do a lot of data entry.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice portable Windows laptop/tablet (Laplet?)", "Author": "Peter M Ornstein", "ReviewID": "R1VQ11M4CDSYAD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hard to rate the hardware since my experience is so intertwined with Windows 8.1.  My experience has been filled with both satisfaction and frustration.  Starting from the beginning - I opened the package and the first instruction is to charge the tablet for 8 hours before even thinking about using it on battery power.  OK - if that is what it takes.  Then during set-up, it wanted to connect via WIFI to my router.  Since I have my router locked down with a MAC filter, I needed to find the tablet's MAC address before connecting to WIFI.  So I skipped the activation step.  The next question is how to find the IP address?  It was not on the tablet or on the box.  After doing a Google search using another computer, I finally figured the secret handshake I needed to perform in Windows 8.1 to get that information (type cmd in START, then type ipconfig /all in the cmd box).  It would have been quite helpful had that basic information been more readily accessible.  The next issue was getting a Microsoft account set up so I can access Skydrive.  I kept getting an error message saying it could not set up the account.  I spent about an hour trying to figure this out, including resetting the operating system several times thinking that there must have been something I missed in the original setup.  At my wits end, I decided to detach the keyboard from the tablet and try it again.  It worked!!  (Why????!  Note to Asus - fix this.)So, now I am reasonably set up and am loading some other core programs that will allow me do web development, such as setting up the IIS server (consulted Dr. Google to figure this out) and loading PHP, MySQL and Dreamweaver.  The other main task I need to accomplish is to see how the tablet can and will interface with a VGA device.  Since the tablet has only a micro HDMI port, and a USB port on the keypad, I need to find a converter.  If I get that all to work, the tablet will meet my core needs - which is why I chose a Windows machine. <- Since I wrote this, it took me HOURS to get mysql, php, and Dreamweaver set up on the IIS server (note: IIS server is a Windows feature that you need to access from the Programs menu in the Control Panel).  While I am not sure exactly how I ultimately got it all to work, I think it had something to do with running the various programs \"as Administrator\" (right click the program in the START menu to see this option).Some reflections on use.  The screen is small and type is tiny.  The keyboard is cramped and the trackpad seems to have a mind of its own, but overall it is not unusable. I also wish the computer had more ports.  But the computer is soooo portable, and it is fully functional.  In sum, I am pleased with the computer, especially as I think I can probably get used to the operating system.  If you are new to Windows 8.1, like me, plan on hours utter frustration until you get to learn it.  Hard to understand why Microsoft went this route.

It seems to be pretty solid hardware, the screen is nice and nothing bad can be said for value of a touch screen tablet including docking keyboard, Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Office Home and Student at a great price.My use of this is primarily for work - I needed something ultra-portable to take notes while on jobs (I am an independent Tech Support consultant), so having MS Word to manage my notes via Dropbox is the ticket.  The keyboard is a bit cramped but I am getting used to it and I prefer it over the touch screen keyboard by far. The touchpad is the device's hardware weak point - nothing a wireless USB mouse doesn\u2019t handle easily.  I am not a fan of Windows 8 but am still getting used to it.However, I just sent it back to the repair center at ASUS. There seems to be a battery drain issue on mine.  It did take a full overnight charge out of the box before I could use it. I was excited to fire it up and start customizing Windows 8, apps, etc.  I like to use it for an hour or so, and then put it into sleep mode so I can pick it up a few hours later and continue.  I used the Windows 8 power settings to choose sleep (as opposed to the function keys on the keyboard) and the next time I went to wake it up and use it the device simply did not wake up.  I thought something was funny so I continued to test this pattern of use the next several days and was consistently disappointed.  It seems it didn\u2019t sleep at all but instead stayed on and drained the battery quickly while not in use.  Sometimes I can hear the camera taking pictures while closed with the keyboard which surely must drain the battery.So then I just started turning it off. Unfortunately, the battery drains overnight even after fully charged and turned off.  Strangely, if I leave it plugged in and charging overnight (fully charged) and then unplug it and use it right away, the battery seems to drain normally.  I can use it a full 6 to 8 hours before it drains down to 20-30%.  Because of this I thought maybe I was doing something wrong to power it off or put it to sleep.  So I worked with ASUS support tech that reviewed it all with me and had me do a hard power reset.  Then I tried it again for the next several days. Problem remains. Still loses charge if I don\u2019t use it for a day despite being fully charged and powered off.

The touchpad needed set up to my requirements and speed. Not perfect but I can get used to it. I left all the ASUS software intact.

It did nothing. It was broken. Not a huge deal as there was another two or three options to set the volume and I didn't want to return it as there were no more in stock.

I finally got round to having a look this morning.Before I was about to start I loaded the Tune In app for some back ground music. BIG mistake. It crashed and rebooted the system. Then it started boot looping, claiming it was fixing the system, fixing it, then back to claiming it was being fixed. I had to do a factory restore. The Win 8 factory restore is infuriating but that's OK..just something to deal with.So I started the restore and it went in to a restore boot loop. I logged in to my account five times and five times it just hung, after crashing every time it rebooted.

After rebooting to the recovery menu (hit F9 as soon as the screen flashes when powered on) I tried several repair, restore and complete windows re-installs to no avail. I found the latest bios file on the ASUS support site and extracted the file to a thumbdrive. The Transformer recognized the thumbdrive immediately so I was able to use Advanced Options in recovery to update the bios. After updating the bios I did a complete system restore and even after installing all of the Windows 8.1 updates everything appears to be working normally.Conclusion: I give ASUS 1 stars for launching a product with such a buggy bios.

I have a MacBook Pro, so playing around with Windows was very fun and exciting. I enjoy the productivity that the T100 has to offer. It has a full Microsoft Office pack (including Powerpoint, Word, OneNote, Excel, Access). I enjoy this device nicely.I followed many advices on Amazon reviews, saying to turn off and manually install Windows Update, and then I used Asus Live Update to install the BIOS 220. Everything is working nicely and the battery is perfect. 11 hours.The keyboard is tight and compact, but I have a bit of smaller sized hand so it works best with me. And yes, it is true that the mouse is unresponsive and that you should turn off Smart Gesture.The reason I deducted a star is because I found it annoying that the ride to Asus T100 was not smooth. Many people would be turned off by the fact that their device is not running smoothly from the get-go and that Windows is messing up. But the device is overall really nice.I could imagine myself having a lot of productivity on this device.However, I am going to return this device. Why? Well... I already have a MacBook Pro, so why intend more money wasting? However, for those who really wants to get nice tablet that is affordable and has full Windows 8.1, then I would recommend this product to them.

Well, I can only compare my disappointment to ...when you finally date that cute, fabulous person and then you discover they have a very bad breath. I hope you smile because there are too many sadder things in life;)I am not an IT person (some of you will say \"of course\" marking my review as \"not helpful\"). I am an average user who needed a very first tablet with a keyboard. Simply a second device to travel with, to browse internet, watch Netflix, writing emails and to type a lot. And Asus T100 seemed to be that perfect choice. I am a Windows person but old enough to use old school alt+F4, ctrl+c / v or x and other Norton Commander keyboard shortcuts. Therefore I need a keyboard since I think Win 8.1 touch screen only ....still needs an improvement. I will definitely miss Windows XP or Win 7 when they become completely not updateable. I am rather a technically conservative person who always used Dell PCs and Nokia phones. I have never been attracted to any apple core devices since I find i-gadgets simply faux-Bohemian. But I wanted to try this Asus product because times change. There is no Saab anymore and people fell in love for instance with Infinity cars. Yes, it is a metaphor and should not be taken literally. Generally, I consider T100 a perfect supplement to your first PC a/o laptop, bigger and more operable than your Smartphone. I chose T100 because of the price, because of having a keyboard and because of being a fantastic 2 in 1. Otherwise I would end buying a tablet, an extra keyboard, an extra folio/cover/stand or sleeve.PROS:Design: Very handy and sleek. I would even say comfy. It feels great both as a tablet and as a laptop.Size: Pretty ideal. Smaller than your first laptop yet bigger and better than your smartphone.Weight: Not too light but also not too heavy delivering a sense of sturdiness and comfort.Speed: Truly fast. Quick and responsive. Very fast web browsing, loading quickly even heavy loaded websites.Keyboard: I love it. It resembles me in size the Dell Mini 10v. Responsive. Sturdy but I also have small hands so perhaps I am not objective.Battery: An absolute winner. Amazing, simply incomparable battery life.Price: Simply unbeatable. Not to mention free MS Office although I had no chance to use it.AVERAGE: screen. Not bad at all but not a killer. Actually nice for the price paid.CONS:Hardware/software issues: I was unable to complete MS Office installation. PC tablets with the latest MS Office are being advertised as \"you can have your office anywhere working, printing, downloading\" etc. Well, I was not even able to have a desk in my \"new office\":( I do not blame MS for that. If there are so many issues with MS Office installation (please read the other reviews), ASUS should simply recall those T100s and fix the problem. It is a big \"no, no\" when people are trying to install and use something truly basic. For the first impression there are no second chances. And, I apologize, but I am not going to call and spend hours with Asus help desk trying to fix that. Especially that during the installation, the unit froze, then switched off and I was not even able to restart it or to reboot it. The start button was unresponsive and the screen was black with occasional semi-blink like being about to restart. Yes, the battery was 100% full before I started the installation.Camera: 1.2 MP is like having a nice, brand new 2014 convertible with a ...0.6L engine. No rear camera. If it is supposed to be a real tablet and we are in 2013, it should have two cameras and not just the front one. Even my smartphone has both. It should be a versatile device: not for Skype only, but also for taking pictures or shooting videos. Of course it saved money, keeping the price under $400 but a compromise should not mean compromising.Conclusion:I am not saying a definite NO to it. And this is why I am leaving 3 stars. Furthermore if I do not find a working (flawlessly) clone of it... I may even buy it again. I will just wait couple of months when the T100 series gets improved.

The second machine I had about 3 weeks, learning how to use it and adding apps. I liked the keyboard, although my fingers would often find keys they should not be using and then we'd have to go back and edit. However, there were a number of system updates that came through and seemed to screw things up - the tablet would get hung up and after calling the help desk, learned the \"trick\" of holding the power button down for 20 seconds, plug in the AC and then restart. That worked a number of times. However, the last time I had been using the web, and walked away for a time. Upon my return, I noticed the machine was off, although I did not turn it off. I thought it was doing an upgrade however, when I turned it back on, the screen kept blinking on and off. I turned it off again, then turned it back on. The start screen came up, but when I launched an app, all I got was the blue screen of death. All the apps were not working. I called the Asus tech support, who told me \"this was an unusual problem\" and we needed to refresh the machine, which meant going back to the factory model and loosing all apps I downloaded. So we try that, however, it asked for a \"recovery key\" which Tech Support said it should not be asking and they could not help me. The screen was dead to the touch, the keyboard was dead. I could access the web only. They suggested I return it to the store (Best Buy) and they would repair it for me. At this point, less than 30 days old, I said no way. This was a POS, the second machine I had, and I expected it to work - not have to be repaired less than 30 days old. The Geek Squad got the same results when I returned it.

It's ASUS, and they're used to making these great tablet/laptop computers2. Pretty nice Screen. Believe it or not I actually kinda like this screen more than my Nexus 10's screen. I know it's of less quality, but the pixel density makes more sense for watching HD video and stuff. Also, backgrounds look good on this thing as opposed to having to find the ridiculously absurd 2556x1600 picture size for the Nexus 10.Cons1. Build quality is lacking. The volume buttons creak, and feel like they might come off or something. The lid doesn't feel like it fully closes with the help of gravity. The trackpad is god awful, and almost so annoying that I'd rather not use it at all (and I'm not generally a trackpad hater).WHEN USING AS A TABLETPROS1. Access to desktop mode in windows.

Obviously, it's not going to be the most powerful machine ever, but it's nice to have access to that kind of stuff while on the go with only a tablet.2. Great touch navigation in desktop mode. I was also really surprised to see find out just how well navigating desktop mode with touch works. I have no trouble opening and closing tabs in chrome, navigating through the file browser, or browsing web pages. Touch input seems to really have advanced in desktop mode, when compared to Windows 7, and I definitely give Microsoft Kudos for this.CONS1. The apps, man. The apps. The app store for Windows 8 is measly at best. I can't even begin to explain how bad it is, compared to android (which is what I'm used to for touch interfaces). When you find an app for a service that you need, it's usually not made by the developer of that service (i.e. youtube is \"touche for youtube\", and soundcloud is \"Clouder!\"). When it is made by the developer, it seems that they either have to submit entirely to Microsofts idea that every app can be squeezed into a 'modern' UI or work really hard to develop against the grain. I can't even explain how unnatural it feels to browse Amazon by scrolling through tiles horizontally, for example. Why Microsoft? Why can't you just let Amazon design their app the way they did for the other touch operating systems?2. Really piss poor UI. Just, in general, getting used to using Windows 8, especially in \"modern\" mode, is a troubling experience. I've experienced annoyance after annoyance. I can't stress this enough. I REALLY don't like it. Overall, the tablet side of things is so annoying, that I pretty much just never use it in tablet mode, even if I'm using it without the keyboard dock. I'd rather use desktop mode while using it as a tablet than use tablet mode, which is just a poor experience. Nuff said.WHEN USING AS A LAPTOPPROS1. Full Windows 8.1. This can absolutely not be understated for me. Having access to chrome, Adobe products, and all other windows desktop apps is necessary if you're going to get a windows tablet/laptop hybrid. You do NOT want to be stuck with just windows RT apps. If this was a Windows RT hybrid, I would not have been able to read any of my digital textbooks on this machine, as the touch version of the Kindle app doesn't even work with textbooks. Seriously, don't consider a windows RT computer. Just don't.CONS1. The keyboard is tiny. Like.. Really tiny. I knew it wasn't full sized, but I didn't realize that it would be THAT small. I have owned a netbook in the past made by Asus, and the keys, while small, were still easy and comfortable to type on. On this device however, I find myself making \"the claw\", because not only is the keyboard more narrow, but it's less deep as well. Meaning you don't really have to reach at all to reach the top row of keys. This makes it really difficult to take notes quickly, or type up papers, etc. BIG con for me.2. The speed, while much better than previous intel atom processors, is still not really that great. Yes, you're not going to have to wait like 15 seconds for chrome to open a new tab, but it's common to have to wait 2-3 seconds for text to catch up to what you just typed. It's also common to have apps take up to 10 seconds or so to start up. It's weird though, because it's not all the time, and sometimes it seems to be pretty responsive, but other times it's pretty annoyingly slow. I think overall this has more to do with windows that it does the machine itself.3. Bare minimum screen size. While the screen real estate (the amount that you can see on the scree) is pretty great, the size of the screen (the physical size that is) is pretty small and will definitely take some time getting used to. Having 1368x768 pixels in just 10.1 inches causes everything in desktop mode to be really tiny, and I find myself crouching in to get as close to the screen as possible most times. Granted, I have great vision, and I'd definitely prefer to be able to see many tiny words on a screen, than very few large words, but it's still fatiguing to use this in desktop mode for too long, and I've found that it definitely keeps from being as productive as I would like to be on it.All in All, I've decided to return it and go with a more powerful and slightly larger hp detachable for $100 more. I'd still like to have it be able to convert into a tablet, just in case a good version of windows 8 does come out (there are rumors), I just don't want to put up with the negatives of having a tiny screen in laptop mode since the update is still in the air.", "Date": "March 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Insanely buggy device... or a few bad apples", "Author": "qp", "ReviewID": "R1CITAKZKIS1WV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Where do I begin with this product..... there are so many bugs... windows updates causing it to crash and requiring a recovery reset.

Previously I used an iPad 3 with a Belkin keyboard to take notes at meetings, review documents and send quick emails in a work setting. The iPad was my second computing device - I had a laptop, but I needed something lighter and with longer battery life to lug around from meeting to meeting. The iPad fit my needs, except for the terrible file management choices that Apple made, which make routine tasks like adding (non-picture) attachments to an email reply almost impossible.Enter Asus T100. At least on paper, this has everything that I needed: small size, physical keyboard, long battery life, and an operating system that pays attention to productivity driven users.What I like about it:- battery life is as expected, when using the device- the core Windows experience is still there. Boring, but it gets out of the way for productivity tasks, unlike iOS7- touch screen laptops are the way of the future.What I dislike:- software integration isn't Asus / Microsoft's strong suit. You have to put up with random annoyances like the the volume overlay not disappearing off the screen once you're done with it, or the software keyboard appearing on screen even when the physical keyboard is connected.- I've also encountered more serious bugs, like the physical software going AWOL - turning itself off. To get it back - a machine reset was necessary.- the thing that's really disappointing is that in spite of the long battery life, the Asus / Microsoft combo hasn't quite mastered the standby. This thing would be dead in 24 hours, whether I use it or not. My iPad could last on standby for weeks.- the Windows 8 split personality. Two applications for OneNote, both fighting for control of my notes. In general, the metro style apps are a bit too design oriented, and sometimes that does get in the way of their functionality.- What good is being able to touch the screen, if I can't pinch to zoom? Most Windows programs support this, but on a 10 inch device, you really need this. Chrome (the web browser) does not support pinch to zoom, which basically makes it unusable. Pity, because IE (both versions) are not as good.- Asus bloatware. I keep ignoring their offers for backup and other useless stuff. I'd gladly pay a bit more to be left alone.- Physical design is mediocre. Buttons can't be controlled by feel only (I've pressed the Windows button numerous types when I was trying to operate volume), the trackpad doesn't have any feel to it, the keys are uncomfortable (after using the Belkin keyboard for the iPad, I know it's possible to make a decent small keyboard)In the end, this does the job, but barely.

The dock has a keyboard, a USB 3.0 SuperSpeed port and a built-in battery, so it's quite heavy, in fact almost as heavy as the tablet itself at a little over 1.2 pounds.  So together the tablet and the dock, which make the whole thing look like a portable DVD or Blu-ray player, weigh about 2.5 pounds, heavier than the Toshiba Z full-featured laptop with 13-inch, higher-resolution screen.  The tablet's battery is rated for 6 hours, and the dock's battery for 5 hours, for a total of 11 hours.  I haven't used the dock that much because it actually feels heavier than the 1.2 pound spec says!  On the tablet, the battery life does feel solid, close to the 6 hours rated, with WiFi turned on.I like the tablet itself a lot!  The only complaint I have is it lacks a central front Windows button, like the one you find on the Surface, the Toshiba Encore, the Lenovo Miix 2, etc.  Here the Windows button is situated on one of the shorter sides, and unmarked, so it's super-difficult to locate it unless you truly memorize its exact location. The button on my review unit, received from Vine is also half-broken as it takes two very hard presses to work each time, not pleasant.  Luckily, Windows 8.1 includes the Start icon which brings you back to the Start Screen with one tap.Otherwise the tablet is pretty good.  It weighs a  little over 1.2 pounds.  It has the latest energy-efficient Intel processor, and it works really fast.  The screen is beautiful and touch points responsive to my taps and scrolls and holds.  I don't have any problem using the touch screen.  My review unit comes with 32GB of storage, about 8 of which is taken by the hidden recovery partition, but apparently it's easy to copy this recovery partition to a USB drive and reclaim the storage for regular use.  I put in a 64GB micro-sd card to store files, although nowadays I store most of my files including music and video files on Skydrive, Microsoft's cloud-based storage.

In short, the juice isn't worth the squeeze.I wanted it to work. I ignored the red flags. I tried to change the T100 for the better, but to no avail.It all started when I walked into my local store to pick one up -- they said they pulled the transformer tablets due to \"issues\". That should have been the first warning sign, but I ignored it.The issues kept on coming. From not turning off properly to crashing to basic well established programs like box flie sync that was throwing issues that didn't even exist on the forums.I wasn't fortunate enough to try the 2.16 BIOS. It was pulled from the ASUS website before I had the chance (I even tried the 3rd party mirror links but Winflash didn't like the file). Maybe the new BIOS would have changed things, maybe not, but my return window was calling and my faith in Asus dwindling.Between all the mixed reviews (flag #2) and frustrated stories in the forums (flag #3), what finally put the nail in the coffin was hearing my family say \"hey, we haven't seen you around for a few days, is everything OK?\" - this is a surefire sign you have been struggling too much with your tablet.The T100 has the right ingredients but the wrong execution. The battery life, speed, and SDD are stellar in this thing, and I hope future generations can learn from the T100.

I am a computer god.  I have used about every operating system since before DOS.  I spend most of my time in a Linux shell.  I wanted something light and portable enough to take with me everywhere to access my other machines/servers and do some lightweight, emergency-type work.  It is not my main machine.  For this, it is absolutely fantastic, although I would upgrade in a second if this ever comes out with a 12-13\" screen and full-size keyboard.  The processor, memory, disk, etc., are adequate for the tasks I expect to perform on it.HOWEVER, it has major power problems.  The buttons, in general, including the touch/track pad are the cheapest I've ever seen.  Holding the power button to get it to turn on/off is literally a pain.  90% of the time, it will just not power off.  It takes 10 seconds before the tiny charging light blinks, but most of the time it reboots and powers right back up.  Yes, that's right.  I have a product I can't even turn off.  Well, the battery life is great, so I should not worry.  But, I am experiencing totally weird things regarding power.  I have all the latest Windows updates and the latest BIOS 304.  Apparently, this computer has had a LOT of power problems.  My first day was fine, and I was impressed by the battery life, excepted for being frustrated by the problem of not being able to turn it off.  My second day, after being fully charged, I took it to my kid's sports practice, opened it up, and it was off.  I powered it back on, and it showed 0% battery.  It had shut off due to draining the battery.  This is after being in sleep for maybe 1 hour.  Ridiculous.  No matter what I did -- power off, etc., it always came back up at 0%.  When I got home, I plugged it into the USB charger, and checked it a little while later, expecting it to take many hours to charge, and it was fully charged after 1.5 hours which is impossible.This thing has power problems.  BIG TIME.  As I type this, it is currently running fine, but I am really leery to keep it.  Any more glitches, and it's going back.

My remedy for this is to upload a free 3rd party app called CLAM SHELL (Google windows 8, clam shell).

It appears to be a great deal.  However, the tablet didn't sit very well within the keyboard so it always took some pushing.  Along with that, the on keyboard mouse was pretty useless as it was a bit unresponsive and often movements I tried to make were imprecise or changed screens on me without my intention.  I practically only used as a tablet but the onscreen keyboard takes up so much space it's hard to work effectively with it in excel, etc.Well, this morning I went to dock it into the keyboard base and as I pushed it in a tiny crack was induced in the screen right near where the left insert to the base is located.  Of course, shortly after, the crack now runs from top to bottom of the screen and the tablet is unusable.  I call Asus, naively expecting an apology and a path to get this thing fixed ASAP.  What I got, even after talking to a manager (Mikhael) was to be informed that my warranty has been invalidated due to physical damage and that my only course to fix was to send to them, at my cost, get repaired, at my cost, and sent back to me, at my cost.  It was like talking to robots.  I guess I'm just another jerk that cracks his screen for fun and tries to claim it's a warranty item.  Absolutely no concern for them about the image that this review would give the product or Asus or that I wouldn't ever buy another product from asus as long as I live.  There isn't even another phone number they could suggest to call.  Got same answer on online chat...Ironically, I'm writing this on my ipad that I've had for 3yrs and never had the slightest issue with.  Anyway, this product is cheap, the customer care is even cheaper, and unless you have a lot of time to waste, I would stay away from Asus products by any name (Nexus, etc.).  They're not local, their a pain to deal with, they have robots working in customer service, they don't care at all, and their products are cheap in quality and design.

After spending a couple of hours setting this tablet computer up for my son (most of it spent in the tedious, intrusive and time-consuming creation of Microsoft accounts, as demanded by the unit's configuration programming...), the little tablet, keyboard and touchpad all appear to be functioning normally.  The keyboard keys have minimal travel, but they do provide reasonable tactile feedback.  The touchpad (which did not work on the first unit that I received) is somewhat slow and inaccurate, but it's functional enough for my 9 year-old son.Because both hardware and software appear to be working properly on this replacement unit, I have upgraded my original \"1 star\" review to \"3 stars,\" at this time.

The two models have complementary faults and strengths. The Vivotab Smart is a well made package with a slow processor and technical issues (wifi; battery drain, and others) that Asus never resolved. The new T100 seems to have a lot more power, is more stable, but I would have to describe its physical construction as junk. This starts with the tablet, which has a hollow, very plastic feel to it. It has more flex, rough edges, and just a cheap feel - almost like a toy. The keyboard is worse. Mine came warped like others have reported. I had to bend it so that the front edge lay flat. The back is supported on 2 rubber tabs when the tablet is raised. The result is that the entire keyboard flexes when you type and the keys have a hollow feel, again, almost like a toy. Also, the width of the keyboard is the same as the previous one, but the keys are not as tall. i.e. the keys are narrow rectangles rather than square. It therefore feels much more cramped than the previous keyboard. Other disappointments are the screen, which is much less bright than the previous version, lack of rear camera, and lower res front camera.

Things generally seemed smooth, programs seemed to run in the desktop mode pretty well too.  I was a little surprised that I didn't have more trouble with the touchscreen while using desktop apps, but I found it pretty good and didn't end up mistyping/miss hitting the icons much at all.  It was generally nicer than the samsung chromebook that I bought it to replace.So, the problems:1) It works better as a laptop than as a tablet. a) This is especially clear when using the desktop mode while holding it in portrait mode.  The way the screen arranges itself makes it difficult to really to too much that way.  Holding it in landscape style it was better b) It is quite heavy.  I think I might have been biased after using a nexus 7 (both 2012 and 2013 models) for so long.  It probably isn't quite as heavy as my old HP touchpad, but it's not that comfortable either. c) It feels rather flimsy especially at the back.  I was worried that it would easily break and even looked for some kind of back cover to make it feel stronger (at $18 the only one I found seemed a bit costly for a problem I should not have had!). d) I really quite liked the dock and liked the way it sat in the dock and found myself not using it as a tablet much at all. e) While windows 8.1 is getting more and better apps there are still quite a few holes in the selection compared to an android.  Again, another reason to use it as a laptop, not a tablet.The issue or question for me therefore became - why shouldn't I get a small touchscreen laptop that is likely to be more powerful, have more storage, feel less flimsy, etc?I can see why people like these and they do have many things going for them, but the compromise between a laptop and a tablet was too much of a compromise for me to deal with in the end.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pay Garbage Prices, Get Garbage", "Author": "Michelle Erica Green \"The Little Review\"", "ReviewID": "RVCKJKZWQEP37", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got it, opened the box, started it up, spent five hours configuring, machine said I needed to reboot several times; on last reboot (triggered by ASUS' own bloatware, the Webstorage program) I got \"0xc000021a error\" -- first recovery effort sent me to get a BitLocker recovery key that let me boot halfway before another critical error, second recovery effort and I can't get past the startup screen.

Let me open my remarks with saying that with my long experience with the many releases of Windows (from 3.1 to 7) nothing comes even close to how bad this is. It is almost unusable. I pity the people who get it and are less experienced than I am. I think the ASUS hardware is excellent (although heavier than I expected), in my opinion all the problems are caused by the OS. The lack of the START button is unforgiveable. There is a 3rd party addition which can be downloaded (called Classic Shell) which helps. Also there is another downloadable help called \"God Mode\" this allows tuning the system's myriad parameters. The poorly implemented separate \"metro\" interface (for the apps that mimic Android or Apple online apps) and the \"aero\" interface (like the current Win 7 interface) make it very confusing.All this I could have lived with, however in 2 days it crashed 3 times and in each case I was forced to recover to the original setup, thereby losing everything I had done. Mind you the crashes were not caused by doing anything very fancy, they just happened. The last one occurred after I set everything up to my liking and was about to take a full backup. I started the backup program and it advised me that there is an update to it and suggested I download it before running it. When it crashed during the download this was the final straw. I packed up the beast and returned it to Amazon. I must say they were very nice about it and I promptly received a full refund. One more thing: two programs that loaded and ran perfectly in Win 7 could not be loaded here and yes, they were important programs for me.I must say there were features I liked, like the preloaded Netflix and the ease of connecting to printers on the network and to other computers (XP and Win 7 both) and the \"free\" Office 2013 included.

I bought this device because most of the tablets on the market such as the ipads and androids have limited functionality. Windows 8 pro on a tablet for only 400$? Sounded like a bargain to me. Asus is ripping us off. Other than the fact that the device is made of cheap material (I didn't really mind that), there are more serious issues with this device. Let's start with the keyboard dock. The keyboard dock seems very fragile. It feels like something that will easily break within a couple months. I didn't really mind its cramped size (I have small hands so I was able to type pretty fast on it). I also didn't have much trouble with the touch pad. Yes, it does lag from time to time but it's really not too big of an issue, especially once you play with the settings. The biggest issue I found with the dock is that it easily disconnects from the tablet. Unless the dock is on a hard surface, it will NOT connect to the tablet. You will have to push the tablet very hard into the dock and you might just break it while doing that. If you're thinking of using this tablet on desktop mode without the dock, forget about it. If you're just going to use the tablet version of windows on this device, you might as well get the surface rt.Other than the keyboard dock, I just hate the feel of the screen. It feels hard and sticky. Typing on the onscreen keyboard isn't pleasant. Which is why a good keyboard dock is essential. Even the screen on my original kindle fire feels better. Basically, this device fails as a tablet and as a laptop.Only thing I really liked about this device was windows 8 pro, the sound, and the battery. The battery really does last all day. Despite my issues with the keyboard dock and the screen, I was willing to keep the device. So, what happened?Well, I was using it this morning and it just froze up. I had to turn it off. Ever since then, it has not been able to reboot.It freezes at the ''Preparing automatic repair screen.'' If it wasn't for this I'd have at least rated this 3 stars. But what good is a dead tablet? I will be requesting a return as soon as possible. I'll be much more careful in my next purchase.I've had a lot of laughs reading one star reviews. I never thought it would happen to me.Update: I think I've figured out the problem. I was blaming Asus but this is really Microsoft's fault. What's crashing these computers is windows 8 updates. I bought a new laptop and it froze while updating. I turned it off and it got stuck at the loading screen trying to update, just like the Asus. Fortunately since it was a laptop I was able to get to the recovery screen and refresh the operating system. Since then I've permanently disabled all windows updates and haven't had any issues. I'm sure the same would work on the asus BEFORE windows updates crash it. Despite this however, I still think this is a 2-3 star device at best and wouldn't buy it again even if the price dropped to $250 because of the issues I listed above. I would give it another star but I think its current average (3.6 out of 5) is way too generous.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Ready for Prime Time", "Author": "D.

It started shutting off randomly and very frequently. I called tech support, they told me if I did a factory reset they were 99.999999999% sure that it would fix my problem - I did what they instructed and it did NOT fix the problem. I sent it in to be serviced, paid over $200 for a new motherboard and hard drive disk. When I got it back, it was not fixed; it immediately shut off. I sent it back in AGAIN to be \"fixed\" and when I got it back it worked for about one month. Now it is doing the exact thing that they supposedly \"fixed\", which is spontaneously shutting off. So now I have to send it back in AGAIN for the THIRD time, and at this point, I have very little confidence that the problem will be fixed, as it was not fixed the previous two times it was sent in. I have never been so disappointed in a product. I will NEVER BUY AN ASUS AGAIN. For being a new company, you would think they would at least have better tech support/customer service since they are having to compete with Apple, Dell etc. They're product is sub-par and their tech support and computer technicians seem incompetent and uneducated about the product that they are selling. I usually never complain about products, I just won't give them my business anymore, but I paid almost $800 for this piece-of-crap laptop that has been the bain of my existence for the past 6 months. I had a lot of expensive architecture software that I lost and that I can't get back. SO-heed my words, if you want a quality product and you have expensive software that you'd like to keep, DON'T BUY AN ASUS, THEY ARE ABSOLUTE GARBAGE.", "Date": "April 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "did not come with office loaded and no product key", "Author": "John D", "ReviewID": "R546OC5LT2EE5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I must say that I have been very pleased with amazon thus far because I have not had a problem.  now that I have a problem I can't get help.

I have a Nexus 7 tablet also manufactured by ASUS and it's got the brightness that which you can use outdoor without much problem but with this ASUS T100, it's DARK! Even if you raise the brightness all the way up it's still lag behind the Nexus 7 with only half way adjusted in brightness. I hate that! This is the same issues I had with Samsung products as well.  This tablet bad enough that it's built with glass screen so you already get the mirror effect but with the lack of brightness it's impossible to view it in the daylight! I hang out at outdoor coffee shops and write blogs and with this tablet, it's impossible! If you're asking about whether this tablet could be a defect, it's NOT. Try placing it next to iPad or Google Nexus 7 and you'll see a huge difference in lack of brightness with ASUS T100.  Another problem with this tablet is the font and image sizes, it's way too small when in desktop mode. I opened the Control Panel window and you can barely see the fonts and images.  The folders are so small that you can't use fingers to select it. And yes, you CAN'T expand the control panel window either so you're stuck with the smallness of the images and fonts.  I have a beat up old HP Mini Netbook I bought 3 years ago for $299 and it's the same screen size as this ASUS but you can see all the fonts and images as they are much bigger by default.  Ridiculous that these two problems are not mentioned in the reviews, both here and Youtube.
