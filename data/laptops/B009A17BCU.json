I ordered this a week before Christmas, was expecting delivery on Monday, the 24th, received it on Friday, the 21st.  Daughter was ecstatic about early delivery and LOVES it!!!!  Charged it up and she's been on it non-stop for the last three days.  Took her a bit to get the hang of Windows 8, but says it works 1000 times better then the Windows Vista that was on her last laptop.  Fast Processing and outstanding color, picture nice and big for watching movies. More than enough storage space for all her music files.  Very happy with purchase.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Loved it!", "Author": "Patrice H.", "ReviewID": "RGH1HCBV5P4HN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Loved that I have the windows 8!

When I use it more I might begin to like it better.  We have other computers with Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.  This computer replaced the one which had Vista which I didn't like.  I would like this computer better if it had a numeric keyboard on the right side.  Other brand laptops with a 15.5\" screen do have the numeric keyboard on the right.

Now that I have it, I am having fun exploring and learning and experimenting.  I have a window 8 cell phone, so I thought it wouldn't be a big adjustment; and yet, WOW!  Learn. Ing. Curve!  But so far I'm happy.  I am pretty good with using computers and when I have a new program it usually doesn't take me long to figure it out, so I am having fun exploring and what not.  If you are like my husband though, someone who does not do change well, buyer beware.  To me though, it just means he will leave my laptop alone!

Due to this can't play any half decent games.  Don't touch the touch pad.  It has a mind of it's own.  The touch pad doesn't know whether it's supposed to act like a touch pad on a laptop, or a touch screen on a smart phone, therefore it randomly selects what it wants to do.  Do not rest your palms on the laptop.  You will end up in strange and unknown places within the computer.  For a non-smart phone user, Windows 8 is the most unfriendly program I have ever used.  Just trying to shut down the computer is an ordeal.  Have to find just the right spot in the lower right corner.  Then catch the \"settings\" button before it disappears.  Now catch the Power button.  Now shut off.  What a pain.  What ever happened to the start/shut down icon?  Everything else most people without Iphones want to do is hidden and you have to figure out how to find it.  All in all I'd say this computer and windows 8 were designed to drive people to the nut house.  I would never recommend this computer to anyone.

If you have problems registering for a Microsoft account, the computer is useless. And if you make a mistake when registering for this account, you cannot reset the computer to delete the incorrect informaiton.  Consequently, you cannot get into the applications. After 5 resets and 8 hours of frustration with little help from Tech Support (HP & Microsoft), I returned the computer to Amazon.  Based on my research, it's almost impossible to buy a computer today that doesn't have Windows 8. Be extremely careful when you are registering for the Microsoft account. Otherwise, you will get locked out and have to return the PC because you cannot use any of the applications.  Windows 8 is not my friend.Amazon was great about refunding my money.
