Just recently the screen started coming apart from the hinge.  The machine internals are good.  It's fast and has nice graphics.  However, it looks like HP cut corners on the quality of materials and workmanship, keyboard, screen bezel, and overall construction of the computer.  If the outside were as good as the inside, this would be an excellent machine priced right.  At $700 - $800, I think it is overpriced for the type of quality and value it offers.

The sound system is amazing with the Beats Audio. As a resident of a studio, I like that I can get some nice sounds without additional hardware (e.g., standalone sound system.) The big screen is helpful and the speed of an ultrabook is phenomenal.

Three times back to service center and they can't fix it. Now they want a technician to come to my house as though that will make a difference. Now we learn that all available technicians are off for the holidays so its now Dec 27 and we wait until Jan 2 to schedule an appointment. Have asked for a refund several times but that is just not in the cards. I will never buy from HP again (and we buy alot around here as we both work through our computers). Bad job HP, very bad job.12/28/2012...after Peter (see his post below) emailed regarding this issue the representative that we've been dealing with all along called again. His purpose was to confirm (again) that we have an appointment to see a technician in our home to review the issue. So after several weeks of back and forth with the service center now we can wait another 10 days for a technician (they are all off for the holidays I am told). We said to Jamie again that what we want is a refund.The best companies to deal with would have long ago taken this lemon back...companies such as Amazon and Costco would immediately end our dissatisfaction...but in this case we purchased directly from HP who only seems to care about their own internal metrics. Next step after the technician visits I will be posting the positive outcome or the videos of this Lemon Laptop will be posted on YouTube and every other social media I can find. Yes, we are upset. This was a birthday gift from my wife and she is way more upset then I am.01/04/13...the technician invested 2 hours of his time and could not get the laptop to act up. He watched a couple of my videos but in the end determined there was nothing wrong with it. Within hours after he left the screen froze up again. i made another video and called customer support. Now we wait for a call back.January 9, 2013 update...we have filed complaints with the BBB and Attorney Generals Office because HP cannot fix the problem and will not offer a refund or an exchange.", "Date": "January 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Crashed after One Year", "Author": "Ajax15", "ReviewID": "R76PDL6JQPJHS", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My hard drive crashed 2 weeks after the one-year warranty expired.

It's necessary to carefully pry this thing open with both hands.  Most new Ultra-books are designed to open smoothly with one hand. NOPE, NOT THIS ONE.Try to open it with one hand at your own peril, the entire laptop lifts up and flips over.Mine fell off the counter this way, smashed the corner and broke off a piece of the case.OK, it's only cosmetic, but here's the other issue.  Since it was delivered, I had been getting the blue screen of death (BSOD) from a failing SSD card.  I was getting ready to send it into HP before \"the fall.\"  Now that it was \"dropped\", HP refused to fix the SSD under warranty (obviously, dropping it didn't break the SSD).So, I spent the $60, bought an SSD card and fixed it myself - everything was working great.Then it happened...My sister asked to borrow my new HP Envy - OK Sis, no problem.I began to demonstrate what NOT TO DO so this thing doesn't break.The stupid piece of junk slipped off my finger about 4 inches from the counter.Guess what, it died! From a 3-4 inch slip. Dead at 6 months old. Give me a break!Call me an idiot for not knowing how to open a laptop, but this is just simply bad design.In the past I bought a new HP laptop every two years.NOT ANYMORE!  I will NEVER buy another HP.", "Date": "April 8, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008BIG2LY"}}
