{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perspective of a Civil Engineer and Computer Technician", "Author": "Joel Novas", "ReviewID": "RXA1TMM5KZEYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First of all, excuse my English, is limited.I am a computer technician and civil engineer.First experience:This laptop is well built, feels good quality. I bought other laptops in this price range and this has been the best in quality.1. COSTThe cost of this laptop is very high compared to the technical specifications of other laptops in the same price range.Example:a) Lenovo Y510 serie 59405668 at $899.00 ( [...] )b) MSI G Series GE60 2OC-097US at $1,099.00 ( B00EARZHA2 )2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS2.1. Processor4th Generation Intel\u00ae Core(tm) i7-4700MQ processor (6MB Cache, up to 3.4GHz)One of the Best on the market. Powerful for any use.NOTE: The cpu clock is 2.4GHz and can be OC up to 3.4GHz (Intel Turbo Boost Technology)2.2. Operating SystemWindows\u00ae 7 Home Premium 64-bit, EnglishWell, for me, Win7 for standard screens (non touch screen) and Win8 for touch screen. I consider as good idea to have Win7 on this laptop.2.3. Memory8GB Dual Channel DDR3L at 1600MHzMemory enough and is expandable to 16GB. Keep in mind that you only have 2 slot of ram and both are in use (2 x 4GB).2.4. Hard Drive750GB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/sIt is ridiculous to find in a ''high-performance laptop'' one HDD, but this 750GB 7200RPM SATA 6Gb/s is good enough. I recommend to buy a SSD. You can expand to 2 disc and 1 msata (3 disc in total).2.5. Video CardNVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GT 750M with 1GB GDDR5There is a noticeable difference between video cards (GT 750M 1GB Vs. GT 750M 2GB). This laptop inlcuides GT 750 1GB wich is less powerful. It is for beginners, but you will not be wrong with this video.2.6. Display (problems with that)14\" WLED FHD (1920 x 1080) Anti-Glare DisplayWell, well, well.. Outstanding but... I found a problem with this screen. Apparently in the left bottom corner, the display shows some light, some sort of stain when you have a dark background.I've had two of this and both have had the same problem.Keep that in mind !2.7. Wireless (problems with that)Killer NIC 1202 802.11n WiFi and Bluetooth 4.0I do not have much to say, not AC (AC is the ultimate wireless conection) and have experienced loss of signal continuously in both laptops. It is getting worse.Keep that in mind too !2.8. Optical DriveSlot-Loading 8x SuperMulti Drive (DVD/R/RW)Standard specifications but its mode of use is great, as the Dell XPS model and Apple computers.2.9. TemperatureWell done for Dell, the cooling system is very good, is maintained at acceptable temperatures the system.An average of 85c for hours of intense play, with ambient temperature of 25c.2.10. Battery6-cell Lithium Ion 69 wHrDuration time:a) Playing almost nothingb) Surfing in the Internet and runs some programs almost 2:30 hrsIt is take too long time to charge the battery.3. OVER ALLParticularly, this laptop has many functions and features that are amazing. One of them is AlienFX Lighting Zones.The vast majority of these features and extras can be seen on YouTube.I will not bore you with that, but I can tell you that those features and extras worth every penny.I RECOMMEND this laptop to anyone who needs a relatively portable and powerful laptop, is not good for serious gaming, but you can play them all.Consider the possible Display problems and Wireless I already have had.", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "In love", "Author": "Briggs", "ReviewID": "R2CEU7ITO2A08S", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is amazing. I used to be one of those people that believed Alienware was overpriced. While that may be true for their desktops considering how easy it is to build one, laptops are not as easy. Not to mention you can't really pick your chassis when doing a build on one. I now know where the extra cost goes to with these. Everything is laid out so perfect, from the over sized palm rests to the SIMPLE to remove bottom plate for expandability. The R&D; on this machine is fantastic. This thing is built for a gamer on the go. So far my only complaint would be the amount of light bleed I get on my screen but that can be overlooked.Is it heavy? - yesis it thick? - yesis it a sexy well thought out polished machine? - Absolutely!", "Date": "January 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop, terrible support from Dell", "Author": "Joe Francis", "ReviewID": "R23J22786D364E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have had a terrible experience regarding the warranty of my Alienware 14 I had a recent issue with the mainboard of my Alienware M14. A technician was dispatched to install a new mainboard, but there were a couple of issues with the service:1.) The technician did not insert the cable to my optical drive, therefore the dvd-rom was not working2.) The left hand \u201ctron light\" on my laptop is always green. Even in \u201cgo dark\" mode. Even after uninstalling and reinstalling Alienware Command Center.3.) The technician changed my sata mode from AHCI to RAID, requiring me to reinstall the operating system. He left when I could not get the machine to boot. Therefore he did not know about the other two issues.sent 2nd tech, who couldn't do basic troubleshooting.This so far had me missing 2 days\u2019 work, and a laptop that did not work properly. This is unacceptable and made me very dissatisfied, but the supervisor I spoke to next is the reason I will likely never purchase a Dell product again. . I called after the technician left to complain and requested a supervisor contact, and the supervisor who responded replied that she would like to talk to me about the issue. I gave her my telephone number and told her that I was available in the evenings after 7 PM Eastern. She called at 4:00 PM, I was unable to take her call. I emailed her and let her know what the issue is, and mentioned to her that I would like to pay the difference and be sent an Alienware 17 that I had be considering as a replacement to the 14 that is defective, as compensation for my lost time and inconvenience. She responded that she could not provide that to me, and offered me an extension on my warranty. I declined, given that the warranty had already cost me 2 days of lost wages from time i had to take off for the technicians to come to my house, and even then, not fix the problem. She then told me that she would have a technician call me after 7 PM to go through troubleshooting She was rude and condescending. She told me that it was impossible, and offered no solution at all. I thanked her for her time and informed her that I would have to sell the laptop and purchase one that I could get better support for. I asked her if the warranty was transferable, and had to ask her several times before she told me that it was. I tried to end the call, then she started lecturing me on how I wasn't accepting her solutions (she hadn't offered any) and how what I was asking for was just impossible. She told me that she was going to escalate the issue with the field technician, and when I tried to ask her which technician, since there were problems with both technicians, she started yelling over top of me. I asked to speak with her supervisor, and she said \u201cNo, you listen to ME now\". I disconnected the call. My Alienware 14 still does not work properly and no one has provided a solution that I can work with.", "Date": "May 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "Xinyu Jiang", "ReviewID": "RAF82AO9EDYJ8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is really perfect when I use it!

Didn't have part so they wanted to send me a refurbished one!?!? A month later they couldn't find an appropriate refurb sent me brand new comp.... It showed up with broken keyboard.... They refused to send me new computer and made me wait for a technician to come by house.  I went almost 4 months without a working comp.  the worst part of  experience was trying to deal with Alienware / dell on phone... So rude to deal with made me feel like they were doing me a favor .... Never understood they sent me a broken comp and replaced with broken comp...
