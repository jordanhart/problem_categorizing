Very easy to use and I still have not noticed any flaws after a week of use. I cannot say whether this computer is ideal for word processing and such programs as this laptop is not being used for that. But as an entertainment device, this things gets an A+. Asus nails it again.", "Date": "January 15, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "AMD A6-3420 Quad Core , 4GB DDR3 1333 MHz SDRAM\n15.6\" HD display with 1366 x 768 resolution for a crystal-clear view\n500GB 5400RPM,WAVE Keyboard with number key pad,Webcam\nATI HD 6520G,VGA, 2 - USB 2.0, 1-USB 3.0\nDL DVDRW/CD-RW reads and writes a variety of formats", "Name": "ASUS X53Z Series 15.6\" Laptop, AMD A6-3420 Quad Core Processor, 4GB, 500GB, WiFi+WebCam -Mocha", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Bp0iEJ5cL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B008UYNEP6"}}
