{"Reviews": [{"Title": "One of the best under $700 notebooks", "Author": "Jeff Carroll", "ReviewID": "R10326OSJ0RU2J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just received my Asus UL30A-X5 yesterday. After much review, and a try-out with an Acer 1410, I decided that I wanted a full-sized chiclet/island keyboard and the larger screen. I'm already quite pleased with my decision. At the <$700 price point, this is an excellent notebook.Pros- Keyboard. A pleasure to type on.- Touchpad. It drags at first, but once you get some finger oil on it, and change the pointer speed, it's one of the best that I've used. Very smooth two finger scroller. Support for customized two and three finger click.- Screen. Bright and easy to read at 30 degree angles.- Battery life. Yes, it will do over 10 hours.- Weight/size. 1 inch thin and very light.- Body. Love the brushed black metal look on the case.- Asus facial recognition login. Didn't think that I would care, but it's nice to have the computer log in, without touch, when I'm sitting in front of it.- Asus FastBoot (not the BIOS fast boot). This lets you configure which programs load during startup and which load after. Speeds up the boot quite a bit.- Decent speakers. Not ear-destroying, but suitable for the size. Much better than most netbooks.Cons- Placement of touchpad. It still registers my palm as I'm typing even at the extreme setting. Downloaded the new touchpad driver, but that didn't fix.  Still looking for a solution. This is by far the most frustrating problem. UPDATE: The TouchFreeze utility seems to almost fix the issue.- Case still shows fingerprints.- Web cam is low res and has difficulty in low light (haven't tried different drivers yet).", "Date": "October 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Excellent Ultra-Portable Laptop at a Great Price!", "Author": "TJ", "ReviewID": "R3Q382L1L7Q7DB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently purchased the Asus UL30A-X5 through Amazon and am very pleased with my decision.  Let me first begin by briefly explaining what I was looking for in a new laptop, as I believe that will give the reader better information when deciding if this laptop is right for them.  I am currently a student on a budget and was looking for the following: 1) Less than $700 in price, 2) Screen size between 13-14\", 3) Windows 7 already installed (I didn't want an older computer with Vista that I would have to manually upgrade to Win 7 myself), 4) At least 320GB HD, 3 GB DDR3 RAM, and a Pentium Core 2 Duo SU7300 equivalent or greater processor, 5) Thin and light, and 6) 4+ solid hours of battery life.  Although a netbook offers a small size and easy portability, I didn't want to sacrifice power and performance for everyday tasks.  On the other hand, I also didn't want a large \"desktop replacement\" laptop that would be a hassle to carry around or difficult to take with me anytime I was away from home.  In summary, I wanted a laptop that offered a good combination of power, performance, and size for my money.  With that being said, here is my impression thus far after 2 days of using this computer:Pros:-Performance: Able to smoothly and efficiently handle everything I have wanted to do to this point.  It is even faster than my 3 year old 15.6\" Dell Inspiron that I originally paid $1300 for at the time.-Size and Weight: Couldn't be happier with the sleek look and light weight. It looks even better in person than in the pictures.-Quality: Some people may think you are sacrificing quality for a laptop with these specs for under $700.  I think this computer is built very well, and would argue it stands up to the much more expensive or name-brand models in the same class.-Warranty: The accidental protection warranty offers an extra piece of mind, which is also something not often included without an additional cost in other laptops.-Keyboard:  Very easy to use, great design!-Mousepad: I love the textured touchpad on this model.  It is difficult to see in the pictures, but the touchpad is actually not a traditional \"pad\", but a bunch of tiny dots that track the movement of your finger.  Also, I really like the extra features such as being able to scroll up or down a page by using two fingers anywhere on the pad.Cons:-The only thing that I am not too excited about is the small (or \"smaller\" when compared to my larger laptop) mouse buttons below the touchpad.  This might be something that just takes a little getting used to, but it is more difficult to click the buttons than on my older laptop.  Again, this is my first 13.3\" laptop so it probably just comes with the nature of a smaller laptop and I will get used to it with time, but it's just something I wanted to point out if you are transitioning from a large laptop to a smaller one.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase.  Sure, there are better laptops on the market as some will argue, but only if you are willing to spend $1000+.  This computer definitely earns \"5 stars\" and I think anyone who is looking for an affordable, ultra-portable laptop with powerful performance will be very happy as well.", "Date": "October 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cheap and good", "Author": "A. Quan", "ReviewID": "R2UD82PZMDEAYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really love this computer despite the facts that it has some issues. I really like the finish, it's very thin, less than 1 inch, but by no means is thinner than the macbook air. The casing is very sexy, it looks very nice from all angles. The keyboard is amazing, the only problem is that it has a little flex but its not the end of the world I can type pretty well. The most annoying thing might be the touchpad, whenever you type and you have your hands positioned close to it, the touchpad might register some click while you type. A lot of people are talking about the battery life of this computer that it won't even reach 10 hours, I can confirm I get 11+ hours on this lappie, Windows 7 is much more energy efficient than Vista (note: I tested under wireless off, lowest screen brightness, power saving mode, word 2007).  I really enjoy the price point its less than $700, which is the perfect price for the performance.PROS: - Stylish, very sexy looking. - Keyboard feels amazing. - Multi-touch track pad works well - Fast compared to a netbook (C2D, 4GB DDR3) - Battery life 11+ hours - Smart Logon, very nice cool feature - Big hard drive 500GB - LED screen has nice viewing angles - Very light and portable - The charger is very small and portable too. - Loud quality speakers from small size - Warranty, 1 Year of accidental Damage - Price its a deal!CONS: - Fingerprint magnet (inside and outside) - Loud Hard drive (a little annoying) - Little flex on the keyboard - ASUS bloatware - Intel GMA4500MHD, where's the UL30A-VT? can't do gaming - It doesn't cook, do laundry, or cleans my room.This computer is perfect for students, and travelers.

Floyd", "ReviewID": "R277820YF09ZJE", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Update 11/14: I've decided that I'm going to return this laptop.  The glossy display is too reflective.  It's not really that noticeable if you are looking at a web page with a white background with the brightness turned all the way up, but in almost every case it's just too glossy for my tastes.  Also, as mentioned blow, this display fails horribly for sharing the screen for something such as watching a movie.  If they swapped out the display and trackpad, this would be the perfect budget laptop.---I was torn between this product and the Acer Aspire Timeline.  I ultimately decided to go with this product because of the battery life claim.  Obviously the battery life claim on ANY laptop is quoted using settings that will not be reflective of the typical user.One of my biggest concerns with this laptop was the processor.  I was not sure if it would be able to handle my daily computing activities.  This machine is by no means a powerhouse, but it is more than capable.  As long as you do not need to do anything such as gaming or multimedia editing, you should be fine with this laptop.  This machine is capable of playing HD videos with a little extra left over for background tasks.Notes:- While you do receive recovery DVDs, if you need to take advantage of them you will need to get an external DVD drive.  I have heard some reports that some external DVD drives do not receive enough power through one USB port and require either a powered USB hub or plugging the drive into two USB ports.  (This is why USB cables for portable HDD and portable disc drives have two heads.)  I am pleased to say that the Samsung USB 2.0 8x DVD Writer External Optical Drive for Mac and PC SE-S084C/RSBN (Gloss Black) works perfectly with just one USB plug.- The power brick can get hot.  One review claimed it got as hot as 130 F.  I have not personally experienced temperatures this extreme.Usage: Microsoft Office, Web Browsing, Media PlayerPros:- Great balance between speed and battery life.- The keyboard is fantastic.- Very lightweight and portable.- The laptop does not get so warm that it is uncomfortable in your lap.- The laptop has a very sleek look.- Excellent value for the price.  Even on top of the specs, they throw in one year of accidental damage protection.  That's an incredible value.- The fans are very quiet even when they are on.- Comes with little bloatware.- Ability to play HD movies with no tweaking whatsoever (using VLC).  Keep in mind that Adobe Flash will soon be releasing an update that will push HD decoding off to the GPU.  If the new 1080p at YouTube is choppy for you now, just wait for the new version to come out.Cons:- The screen is very glossy and reflective.- I've really discovered that the viewing angles aren't all that great if you want more than one person to look at your screen at one time for something such as watching a movie together.- The track-pad is less than ideal.  The track-pad tends to move the cursor position while you are typing.  The gestures are nice, but I found that the scrolling doesn't register.  The trackpad utility is greatly lacking in features.- The hard disk squeaks.  It's not terribly loud, but you will notice if you have no other background noise.- The chassis is indeed a fingerprint magnet.  Again, this seems to be an issue with every make and every model laptop these days.- No back-lit keyboard.  This is not necessarily a bad thing since a back-lit keyboard would drain on the battery.", "Date": "November 11, 2009"}, {"Title": "I'm very pleased with my UL30A-X5!", "Author": "Dave the Love Enforcer", "ReviewID": "R1KJ8KBTM3OHT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little laptop is a wonder. It's a beautiful piece of hardware, runs very quick, multitasks great, is dead silent, and I'm getting 10-12 hours of battery life on stock configuration.I've never seen anything like this; you just keep using it and using it and using it. Even when I've got every MS Office program running at once + a bunch of Firefox tabs + iTunes playing music, I still get 6-7 hours.I was pleasantly surprised how little bloatware came with it. The only annoying piece of software I really needed to uninstall was some antivirus program. MS Office Home/Student came preinstalled on a free trial, but I was going to use that anyway so they saved me the installation.Windows 7 runs great on this laptop. Power management and networking features work beautifully. The great sleep/wake functionality in Windows 7 makes startup time largely irrelevant, but even when you do have to start up from scratch it's nice and speedy. There are lots of nice little touches to this machine that let you know Asus is a really class act. Things like attractive on-screen displays for volume and brightness adjustment for example.My only nitpick is that the trackpad is a little jumpy. It's a little hard to land the cursor onto some of the smaller buttons, like scrollbar arrows. This is probably a driver issue, so it likely will be fixed soon enough. The keyboard is very spacious and pleasant to type on.Overall I'm extremely satisfied with my UL30A-X5.", "Date": "November 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome, period.", "Author": "B.

Best Lap Top I've owned", "Author": "A. Toye \"310art\"", "ReviewID": "R3HOT71XJARUMU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using laptops for close to 20 years.  This is actually the most powerful and the least expensive laptop I have owned.  The interesting thing that this machine has is the \"express gate\" boot up.  If you don't read the intro instructions you might miss that it has 2 \"on\" buttons. One on the right and one the left.  The left side on button boots up a linux based operating system in about 15 seconds.  It really basic and only offers a web browser, a music and photo program.  This fast boot is great for just checking your email or surfing the web.  Since it is linux based and separate from your windows 7 operating system, it's like a MAC, viruses or spyware has no effect.  What a concept.  Actually, in that web browser, other than saving passwords and bookmarks, it does not let you saving anything or download anything to the harddrive.  You can save it to a memory stick if you want to save attachments or a download.I have also partitioned the 500 gig harddrive to set up a third operating system for my linux ubuntu.  But that is another story.  The windows 7 operating system works great and very stable.The major things I like about the ul30a are:  1. Prefect size of keyboard.  2. Great screen  3. Super fast  4. Super large harddrive  5. My estimate of battery life is around 6-7 hours.  I have never run it down to zero. But I don't think i will get the 10 to 12 hours Asus advertises.  One of the differences between the ul30a-x5 and the ul30a-x2 is the x5 has a 6 cell battery and the x2 has a 8 cell battery.  (also the x2 is silver and has a 2 year replacement warranty.  The x5 has a 1 year warranty)  6. Asus ExpressGate fastboot.  When you want to turn it off, you don't even have to go thur shutdown.  Just close the screen and next time you turn on the expressgate, it is a totally fresh startup,  ie it doesn't waste energy in hibernation or sleep. because it don't save anything.  7. I have not had any problems with the wifi reception.  It has in fact been very strong.  8. Great builtin speakers and great sound.Things I don't like about the ul30a:  1. When i am in expressgate or ubuntu, the cursor jumps around while i am typing.  I don't notice this in windows 7.  (is anyone else having this problem?)  2. It could be a little lighter.  (I wish i could have compared it to the ul20a.  The ul20a is lighter but a little smaller with only a 250 gig harddrive and 2 gigs ram instead of 4 gigs. Has anyone out there used the 20a and the 30a?)  3. The webcam shows an upside down picture of me in ubuntu.I did have a problem with my first UL30A.  The switch in the hindge the causes the laptop to go into sleep or hibernation mode was faulty and the laptop went into sleep mode when the screen was moved.  Amazon to their credit was very good and sent me a replacement within 5 days.  And this was just before Xmas.Update March 13, 2012It ran fine for 2 years.  Then one day it died.  I hit sleep and it never woke up.  I sent it to Asus.  They said i needed a new motherboard and LAN but I declined the repair because it was $460 for parts and $65 for labour.  They did not charge me for the service and returned the computer for free.  I think that it is just a loose connection on the motherboard because the laptop is now working fine as long i remove one of the 2 gig ram chips.  If anyone has any ideas that would be helpful.  I still love this computer but I reduced the rating by one star to 4 because of the problem.", "Date": "January 3, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent in Every Way!", "Author": "R. D.

I love everything about it! The screen is sharp and bright, the keyboard is well laid out and a pleasure to use, it's fast, light, good looking, has lots of RAM, a large hard drive, plenty of USB ports (3), great speakers for a laptop, exceptional battery life, runs cool and quiet, boots quickly, well priced considering all the features, and seems quite solid. The touchpad is easy to use, although I turned off \"tapping\" (a unless, annoying feature of laptops, IMHO). Its size is perfect for travel, although perhaps a bit small as a desktop replacement. It doesn't come with any software to speak of, which is fine with me as I install my own software. The ExpressGate feature is not of much interest to me -- the resolution is lower than when in Windows, it doesn't do e-mail, and I can wait a few extra seconds to view the web.

This is a great little laptop, but minor niggles and annoying design choices keep it from being the perfect notebook/thin-and-light computer.The pros, as so many others have written it down before me: light-weight, powerful-enough for most purposes (I haven't tried running my Igor Pro codes on this yet), Win7 is pretty cool (I skipped Vista; Win7 = Vista cleaned up?), pretty nice speakers*, long battery life (though I get only 5-6 hours, but w/o battery saving mode or with, but running an external webcam**.)  Small power adapter.  Smart-login (using the included webcam) works on-and-off, depending on the lighting conditions (d-uh!) and on the security settings you employ (I have it on the factory-default.)  Large hard-drive.The cons and niggles, or what in my view prevents this little nugget from being a true contender:1) *Speakers face downwards! So when it's on my lap, I have to be careful not to cover the speakers, otherwise the neat sound gets muffled.UPDATE: From the ASUS website, \"The angle of the speakers also allows audio to be `bounced' upwards from any surface to provide better amplification, delivering a wider frequency range, which in turn produces lower pitches that allow users to hear every reverberation of the drums, as well as every note in pitch perfect quality.\" Ummm... sure.2) The battery was initially tight in it's slot, but has started jiggling (yes, I have locked it properly.)  Duct tape? :-)3) The price of being a sub-4lb notebook: no optical drive.  I just purchased an eMedia guitar learning software pack - which comes as a CD - and had to dig out my old external DVD-writer.  I am hoping that most of my not-on-TV-movie-watching and software will be downloads. [Thankfully, the eMedia upgrade from v4, which I have, to v5 is a download.]4) Dirt and finger-print magnet.5) I tried removing the plastic from the touch-pad, but it started behaving erratically (glue remnants from the sticker?), so I put the plastic back on.  I use an external mouse (trackball) when possible.6) **Webcam is just 0.3 MP, which is barely OK for video-chats.  I use an external, higher-resolution webcam to record my dog when I am away (she's getting over separation anxiety issues.)7) UPDATE: Just remembered: No Bluetooth (available on the Vt series.)

Hope that you don't have any issues.About ASUS service:I purchased the UL30A-X5 from Amazon the day it was released.  After about a week of use, I began to have problems with the hard drive (unsure if it was a problem with the drive itself or perhaps the connection to the motherboard).  The HDD is the most delicate part of a laptop, so I wasn't upset because it happens.  I called ASUS and explained the problem, and they told me I could either return the laptop (and pay for my own shipping materials; they wouldn't send a box) or they could send me a new hard drive, but I would have to pay to ship the old one back.  I chose to return the laptop since I still had my Amazon shipping materials.  They also wanted me to FAX a copy of my receipt, and said the department that processes returns could not accept an emailed scan because they didn't have an email address.  They kept the laptop for 2 weeks after receiving it.  I called several times in the meantime, and the CSRs never had any information on the repair status or estimated time to repair.  They have an online tool where you can supposedly look up your repair status with your RMA number, but it never worked for me.  They told me I would be notified whenever it was fixed, but I never was.  Delivery requires a signature, so not sending me a notice or tracking number (so I would know when to be home to receive it) was quite an omission.  To their credit, they did replace the entire laptop, but the entire process was inferior to the experiences I've had with returns to both HP and Dell.About the laptop itself:PROS:-One of the lightest laptops for its screen size.  From the moment I received the shipping box I was amazed at how light it was.-Battery life is very good, although shorter than that of the UL30A-A2 and similar models (it comes with a 4400 mAh battery versus a 5600).  I get about 6-8 hours out of it under normal usage.-Processor isn't a powerhouse but everything runs smoothly.  Windows 7 works great on it. 4GB DDR3 RAM means no stuttering even with many applications going at once.-Keyboard is full size and keys are evenly spaced.  I have long fingers but can still type perfectly, unlike with a netbook.-Plenty of ports, inc. HDMI output-The brushed aluminum lid does look great, especially in black!-Price represents outstanding valueCONS:-Has a high-pitched whine sometimes, I think from the HDD spinning up.  Only noticeable whenever when the room is very quiet, and only because the rest of the laptop (particularly the fans) are so quiet.-No optical drive. You can use Daemon Tools Lite for reading .iso files, but if Windows is corrupted it might make restoring difficult.  The laptop does come with a recovery DVD, although you would have to find an external DVD reader that will work without Windows drivers if you ever needed to restore it.-Screen is really glossy and reflective.-Weak webcam-Comes with a moderate amount of bloatware (including trial media burning and label making software for the non-existent optical drive)Overall I am very pleased with the laptop (now that I finally have a working one after a month!)  I'm not sure I would consider it a desktop replacement, but if you already have a desktop at home/work or your computing needs are light, it makes an excellent travel companion.  It's shortcomings are greatly outweighed by its positives.

The display is great, clear and vibrant, sound is quite good but don't expect low bass tones, the speakers are too small, but there's good volume.The drive is partitioned into C: and D: when it comes, and using Windows 7 is not that difficult.  I am a Windows 7 neophyte having used XP for years.  I like Windows 7 - once you get used to how the menu displays, and you can adjust some of the menu features to suit your needs.  The \"find program\" feature just above the start button helps you find where functions/programs are that are not readily apparent when you first start.  Overall the Windows 7 experience for me has been fine, different, but better.  I like it.I also purchased Acronis True Image so I could create drive backups - this is a program I've been using for years and it is the best imaging software available so you have peace of mind regarding your system crashing.  You can set up another boot partition and write a drive image directly to the internal drive, another image to the D: partition, and it can be copied to USB external drive or DVDs.  Check Acronis out, it's great.Overall I am 100% satisfied with the laptop, it's features, speed, looks, ease of use, etc.  It's quiet, cool, and has no flaws.  By the way, don't believe the 12-hour battery life advertising.  If you are running the laptop at full display (default), and you run on the batteries, the indicator says about 6 hours.  I expect if you dim the laptop some that time lengthens.  Either way it's plenty of time to run on batteries, and it charges back up pretty fast.  There's a very good review on [...], besides the one here on Amazon.I have absolutely no regrets on this purchase, and I read tons of reviews, and compared small profile laptops for at least two months before buying the Asus UL30A-X5.  If I needed another small laptop, I'd buy another.One last thing, as you know from considering this laptop, the screen is small when compared to a standard 15\" laptop, so not all web pages display in full view so you have to scroll down a little more, so keep this in mind if you buy this item.  The fact that it is so light, portable, user-friendly, and fast, clear, bright, quiet and a smooth piece of electronic engineering overweighed this for me.Take out your credit card and buy the Asus if you are hesitating, you won't be sorry.", "Date": "March 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Asus UL30A-X5 Great laptop", "Author": "Nenad Petrovic", "ReviewID": "R3U24R7K0392ZJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have this laptop over a week now and I'm VERY happy with it.

Windows 7 works very well with this machine setup, and despite the low processor speed, I found this laptop does a lot of the common tasks very well.The only real downside I have with the UL30A is the material construction.

Wouldn't necessarily recommend this notebook as your only notebook unless you didn't need a graphics card or an optical drive but if you did, why are you looking at this notebook?This is a thin and light notebook so that means it between a netbook (which is garbage) and a full featured notebook. Thin and light notebooks have a low voltage CPU, no optical drive, no video card (more than likely), long battery life and perhaps a SSD drive. The best thing to compare this to is a Dell Adamo. But an Adamo cost more than twice as much and it's not worth twice as much over this. For those Mac people (yes your are a people) the 13\" Macbook Pro is basically the same dimensions and the same thickness however it has a graphics card and an optical drive. Even though I never owned a Mac I was contemplating it. The Mac does cost 1000, though you might be able to get one for 900 after rebate. Processor is faster too but less RAM and battery life is not as long.Before I give my review some people complained you can't play games. Well you can play games. You just can't play games with high frame rates those would be your first person shooters and auto racing games. I don't play those games so I don't care. I played Tales of Monkey Island (great series BTW) on it for a bit and it played well. Now I won't lie to you, it wasn't as smooth as on my desktop but it played about 85% comparably. The frames didn't lag just the cursor moved slow. Could be because I was using the touchpad, I didn't have a mouse. Played well enough to enjoy the game.You also say you can't edit video and use Maya on the computer, true. But who would want to? You need a 3 button mouse for Maya and who wants to model on a 13 inch screen with a 1366x768 resolution? The horror. Also if you are going to edit video chances are you need an optical drive and you probably would want a bigger screen as well. This isn't the notebook for that stuff. A desktop is way better for that unless you need to edit in the field on the go.The notebook is pretty fast and good at multitasking. Photoshop 64 bit runs well on it. The notebook is also ultra quite, you don't even know it's on. It did make some noise though when I was streaming video online. That was the only time it made noise though. It also doesn't get hot when on your lap, which is great, because most notebooks are like a heating pad. I played some 1080 HD video I shot with my camcorder over an external hard drive. It played it really well no lag time or anything. This is important since I want to get an external Blu Ray drive since no computer under 1800 comes with one built-in. That's why I didn't care if it had an optical drive because no notebook has the drive I want.Battery life test, I went on a flight across country. First flight was about 4 hours and 15 minutes. I used the notebook probably for about 3 and half hours or more. On the second flight I used it for about 20 minutes cause I fell asleep for most of the flight. So total time was probably 4 hours usage. It had about 63% battery left. It probably would go for 9 hours. Important thing to keep in mind is that if you want the long battery life you need to keep the brightness way down. I took it off the built-in settings. In order to get about 9 hours the brightness needs to be about 2 of the slider notches above the lowest settings. So the third setting in from the left. Now that isn't very bright but it is bright enough to see and do things on the notebook. If you make the screen any brighter you will lose battery life. I don't see how you can get 12 hours unless it is on the lowest brightness setting and you don't do much other than surf the web. But what's the point? So don't buy this and expect 12 hours or regular usage it won't happen.Someone said the viewing angles aren't the greatest. Well yes if you stand up and look at the screen it's washed you can't see it. But if you are directly in front of it you can see fine. You can also view it off centered to the left and right and see the screen fine. It's like any other notebook screen. If you have the brightness as high as it goes, the screen is really bright and I do mean bright!The only negatives are, yes it does pick up a lot of fingerprints. But so do all gadgets these days. The webcam really does suck. Not sure why they would put a 0.3MP camera in a notebook made in 2009, but they did. Not that MP is the only thing that matters for quality but still. I'll probably never use it anyway but it is nice to have if you need it. For the life of me I can't use the multi-gesture touchpad. Now I did have problems on a Mac so maybe it's just me. But I can never get it to scroll and when I finally do it is like ultra sensitive and goes all the way in that direction. Not a big deal it's more of a gimmick but maybe I'll get the hang of it.I wish the processor was a little faster but it's still good, so thumbs up by me.

I am a college student (Engineer) and this laptop is perfect for productivity around campus all day, as well as entertainment in the form of music and video. I did fair amount of research before my purchase, and know what I'm talking about.Here is a quick rundown of the specs and my comments on each one.* 1.3GHz Intel SU7300 Core 2 Duo Processor-- Very Fast processor, runs windows7 perfectly. Better processor than all other thin and lights in this price range. Don't be mislead by the low speed specs. This ultra low voltage processor is the key to having great battery life.* 4GB of DDR3 RAM, 2 slots, 4GB Max-- Better quality RAM than most other laptops, 4GB is more than enough for some multitasking. (I currently have 5 firefox tabs open, itunes, and Word to type this review.) Non-upgradeable, I wish there was a little room for future enhancements, not a deal breaker.* 500GB SATA Hard Drive (5400 RPM)-- More space than I need. I've had no problems with the hard drive making noise.* 13.3\" HD LED LCD Display-- Very bright display. It is GLOSSY, don't understand why everyone hates the gloss, I like it, videos look sharp.*Intel GMA 4500MH-- Average graphics card. I am not a gamer, or a video editor, and therefore have no need for the intense graphics.*0.3M Webcam-- Terrible web cam. It is very low resolution. Very slow, grainy, and dark. The facial login feature didn't really work. This is the only hardware on the laptop that is not top notch. oh well.* Windows 7 Home Premium Operating System (64 bit)-- Love windows 7. File transfer was very convenient, took a while using the wireless option, but automatically transferred all of my documents, internet settings, and some preferences.* Aesthetics-- Very sexy machine. Black aluminum outside finish is nice, gets some fingerprints. Interior glossy black plastic looks nice, gets a lot of fingerprints. My macbook toting roommate is envious.*Battery-- Mine gets about 8 hours on the entertainment setting. Make sure you lock the batter in properly, there are two locking slides. Ive read some complaints about the battery not fitting snugly, mine is pretty secure.*Track pad-- Nice, not great not terrible. Much better than HP's trackpad. Not as good as Sony's. Multi touch works great.*Keyboard-- Nice size and keys have a good bounce. Right hand shift key is small and I am still getting used to it. There is a little flex when typing.*No Optical Disk Drive-- Who cares?*Expressgate-- this is a Linux based OS that lets you surf, skype, IM, and view pictures. Have not used it extensively, but can say it actually does boot in 8 seconds. The web browser is sub-par, so if you want to browse for more than, well 8 seconds... Just use Windows (boots in 30-45 seconds).As previously mentioned I am and engineering student, have have installed MATLAB and SolidWorks and both work great. You can be confident that this laptop will run big, processor heavy programs to do any design, simulation, or programming. Oh and it can run Facebook like a boss.At the end of the day, I love this laptop and would recommend it to anyone looking for portability, functionality, and some sex-appeal.

Kwon \"dkwon\"", "ReviewID": "R1TLKZ67XGNIUV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Buyer beware. If you're considering this laptop because 10 hr+ battery life is a priority for you, look again. This laptop does not have anywhere near the 12 hours battery life as advertised. The most i've seen the battery life icon give it in Windows is 8 hrs (for just a few seconds before it dropped to 6) but in reality, real life time is more like 4-5 hrs of continuous use (word processing, internet surfing, emails). Decent battery life but not near the 8-10 hrs reviewers have been giving. Why the discrepancy? Here's what I've determined. The UL30A-X5 comes with an 8 cell battery but rated at 4800 mah (65wh). Just looking on ebay, there are 8 cell batteries rated at 5600 mah (85wh) or more for the UL30A which would give it better life. Plus, you can get 12 cell 7800mah (112wh) batteries which I presume would give you perhaps more than the 12 hrs as advertised for about $70 on ebay. But this laptop doesn't come with it either one of those longer life batteries. So long story short, I'm guessing that ASUS has swapped out the battery which gave the UL30A 12 hr battery life with a smaller capacity one that gives you good battery life, but not the 12 hrs as advertised. Nowhere on the laptop itself (you know how they advertise features using stickers) or packaging does ASUS advertise 12 hr battery life for this model. Just in the Amazon product description, the customer reviews, and in older laptop reviews can you find mention of the 12 hr battery life. Very misleading.Otherwise, the keyboard is good for typing. Screen is nice but overall, the computer is too glossy for my liking. Looks cheap. Speed is great for playing even 1080p video streams. Blu-ray compatibility test (cyberlink BD and 3D advisor) tells me this computer can play blu-ray no problem (just need to connect an external BD player). Wireless connection is fast with N connection. Speakers are good for a small laptop. Boot up time is 55 seconds from off to the Windows desktop. There is a nifty 8 second bootup feature which dumps you into DVD player, Internet and skype almost instantly. But the resolution is fuzzy so i don't know why you'd want to surf the web this way. Hard drive speed, while it's only 5400 rpm, is fast and quiet. In fact, this laptop is very quiet and stays fairly cool. And it is thin and very, very light.In conclusion, I was prepared to live with a glossy computer, slower cpu and smaller screen because of the long battery life. But now I'm stuck with a laptop that is an older core duo and I still don't have super long battery life. You can get a much more functional laptop (ie. DVD burner included and at least an i3 processor) which is only a bit heavier with similar battery life to this ASUS for the same price. But here's a thought. If I get an extra 12 cell battery off ebay for $70 and keep the current 8 cell for backup, I should be able to run almost 14-18 hrs continuously before I have to charge.

This was a heavy 15.6\"/dedicated graphics, thick machine which ended up also being a pain to lug around.  I looked into netbooks and decided that they were really too small for what I needed. I have a desktop but wanted something for travel and around the house.If you are considering between this and a netbook, get this!THE REVIEW:WeightAfter opening everything up Windows 7 finally got configured and I could start using the laptop. First of all this machine is LIGHT! I was surprised when I put the battery in how light it really is. At the same time the laptop feels solid, so you don't have that trade-off between quality materials and weight reduction. Ultra-portable is definitely a great way to describe it.Feel/AestheticsAs I said, the laptop feels absolutely solid. Even thought the inside is made of shiny black plastic, it's not thin. The lid/screen moves easily on the hinges, while at the same time not sliding to the sides or left to right. Also, the screen does a good job of staying where you set it and not sliding down toward the closed position. Speaking of, the lid closes well without any noticeable gaps as some laptops have. The one complaint about the laptop's aesthetics is that is shows off fingerprints like crazy. any time you touch it (the lid or the body) you get a nice fat print of whatever hand was there - this is not a big deal since you can just wipe it down, but still a minor annoyance. Finally, a few people have complained that the screen is too glossy. It is very glossy, but not enough  to make it difficult to use, and this is only an issue when the screen is very dark. Once you star using programs you can't even notice it.Usability/FeaturesObviously you are getting something without a DVD+/- RW so you lose some weight and bulk, but also the feature. Look into the ASUS SDRW-08D1S-U as an external solution, it's pretty solid as well. I got that as a combo purchase with this and it works well. It looks like it goes together. It's noteworthy that you are asked to make a DVD backup when you fist boot up - but they also give you a driver and OS Cd, as well as a recovery partition. (Side note: They actually have 3 partitions, 1 recovery (hidden), 1 OS, 1 Data. I merged the Data and OS). You will probably neve use fast gate btw, it's fun, but not that worth it. (FastGate is their linux program that boots the computer in 10 seconds and does basic web browsing and music playing... maybe that's why they have 3 partitions! Uh Oh.. more on that later.There is plenty of power under the hood here. The 4GB of RAM makes it snappy, although this is somewhat undermined by a slower processor (my desktop has 1Gb Ram (PC5200) and a C2D @ 3.1 Ghz, sometimes if feels faster). Overall things seem to run well. Windows 7 has a lot of services in the background and if you don't uninstall ASUS's features then they will run too. Speaking of, you should uninstall most of them. They are pointless. Keep the Power4Gear though. Also, another way that you are saving battery is with integrated graphics. I was worried about Intel's 4500HD but I did some research and didn't see too much knocking it down. Integrated is never going to compare well to dedicated graphics, but what are you really using this laptop for? If you want graphics, get a different model (Asus has plenty of other great ones). Also, my old laptop which had a dedicated card had a LOUD fan and got VERY hot. This the UL30A- series has stay cool technology which actually does work. While the laptop might get a bit warm, it is never very much and it takes a while of being in the same spot. I can't say I've found it to be truly uncomfortable on either the top or bottom.One other complaint that I have is the sound quality. It's pretty terrible - when you have the laptop on your lap. The speakers are on the underside of the chassis so your legs will muffle it. Supposedly this is some sound enhancing technique that bounces the sound off of a table to give it more definition, but that sounds like a stretch. Nonetheless, the laptop does sounds better when I set it down in front of me, not so much as to 'WOW' me, but enough to interest me and make note.I also tested the HDMI output. I grabbed a HD (720p) video from YouTube and played it over HDMI. There was some slight stuttering (barely noticeable) when played on my TV, but I think this is from VLC (the media player) indexing files as well as the laptop showing the clip both in its own screen and passing it to the TV. I need to try this JUST on the TV, but I think it will be fine. I played some full 1080 clips on the TV as well and they looked fine. I can say that I am confident the HDMI is solid and will perform admirably. I was surprised at how well it handled normal use and the second video - especially for an integrated graphics card.Next, the battery. I saw a lot of questions about what size it is, how many cells, what's the length, etc. Well, it boils down to this - it depends on what you do. I was running 3 or 4 installations and burning a CD and it dropped pretty quickly. I saw 4:10 at only 68%. However, after I was finished, I kept using the laptop (web browsing, music, etc) and was still at 4 hours when the battery decreased to 54%. So it is all relative to what you are using the laptop for. In full disclosure I have tweaked the settings on Power4Gear. I don't need the brightness up in Quiet Office. Since the screen is usually the largest consumer of battery, I felt that it was worth it. P4G also lets you set upper limits on the CPU, so I changed that just a bit. Oh, and the stickers on the laptop say 10 hours, not 12. It doesn't matter because you can only realistically expect 8 hours at most, but I still wish there was more consistency (see the RMA section below too).I don't have a better place to put this, but the webcam is fine. 0./3 mega pixels is low, and I did notice that there was a large lag in what it picked up (try waving), but for quick video chat where you are just sitting there talking - it's fine.RMA!Finally, my problems section.I am RMA'ing this unit to fix the keyboard. I know I just put up a glowing (almost) review of the unit, but this was manufactured and things can go wrong. I hope this helps people who have not seen a review of their customer service. ASUS always ranks high in this category and I agree with that. Someone said that when looking at the same price point most laptops have the same specs, so it comes down to feel, aesthetics, and customer service - great summation!) Ok, on with it. The left side of the keyboard is loose and it makes an annoying ringing/jingling sound when you type. I was in a meeting and had to stop because it was that noticeable. This is not a functional problem, rather an annoyance. When you pay $600 for a laptop, this shouldn't be an issue. So I called them. It was easy, I was talking to a person after only 2 menu's (so 15 seconds or less) and they gave me two options: 1) they send me a keyboard and I do it or 2) I send it in. I chose the second not because I can't but because if they do it, I don't have to deal with warranty problems in the future if they should come up. So I'll be without my laptop for 2 weeks. They also pay shipping both ways, so it's ok. Oh, and I hear different things different places, its a 1 year manufacturers, and a 1 (parallel) year of Accidental coverage. I thought it was 24mos.Pros:LightGreat battery performancePowerfulCheap!HDMI outCons:The KeyboardPre-installed junkSpeaker placementMajor Complaint:I had to RMA the keyboardBottom Line: Get it. I give the laptop a 9.5 / 10. I really wish there were other things in here like an SSD and USB 3.0, but I paid $600 for it.

Movies and YouTube look great (no jitters), and Ubuntu runs with all its extra visual effects.

I have no idea what could be causing it, but its a minor detail.Pros:Great battery, averaged around 6-8 hours with fairly heavy use.Great display and graphics, I have the screen to almost minimum brightness and its still crispCool design, both visually and thermally, very lightweightTrackpad, the different actions you can make with just the pad are cool, it definitely saves a lot of time.Keyboard, it seems to be the perfect size for most hands.Cons:Sometimes it can act a little squirrelly, i think thats more the OS fault.Trackpad, It can be really touchy, I would STRONGLY recommend manually updating the drivers for this, Windows Update seems to miss it.Random Flex on the keyboard surface, more of a nuisance than a problem though.Missing or broken drivers, you would think all the drivers would be up to date but oh well, again just annoying.Overall I would recommend this laptop, do make sure to manually update all the nessecary drivers off of the Asus website, it will fix the webcam issue and the trackpad issue.", "Date": "March 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "Wonderful Product", "Author": "M.

I want to quickly clarify a few things that I read in other reviews.- some people mentioned that the battery life was only 6 hours instead of the stated 10-12 hours. I disagree, as long as you have Wifi off, do not run heavy multimedia applications (like watching movies) and are in the power saving mode, you will get 10-12 hours.- some people said the battery was loose. I noticed this too, when you put the battery in, it only clips in on the right side of the laptop. There is a small switch (next to a read lock symbol) on the left that you manually have to lock.

It lasts about 8 hours for me, and I am I suppose what you would call a \"power user\" (programming, lots of browsers open, music playing, external monitor, etc.), so I am quite pleased.The performance is not at the level of a full-fledged Core 2 Duo laptop, but it is leaps and bounds ahead of the Atom processor (I also have a netbook). The graphics card can indeed play 720p and 1080p movies, but not as smoothly as an Nvidia graphics card. 2-D and 3-D rendering are also not as smooth, and external monitor and TV support is not as good as I would like. Intel graphics cards seem to pump out really high-contrast and high-sharpness output to external displays. Regardless, I was well aware of the fact that this laptop had an Intel graphics card, so this stuff really doesn't count against the review.The touchpad does have issues with registering palm touches. I've heard of utilities you can install to circumvent this issue, I just haven't looked into them yet. I also installed Ubuntu on it, and the touchpad is even worse. It registers ANY touch at all. Sometimes I don't even notice I have touched it. Yet again, I have not looked into a solution (haven't been using Linux much this past month), just thought it would be useful to mention. The multitouch features are very handy though - love the two-finger scrolling and the three-finger right click. From a design sense, I like how the touchpad is flush with the casing, although I do admit my hand will sometimes slip off the pad and I don't notice right away. Not often though. The mouse buttons are kind of hard to press, but I really don't care because I mainly use tapping.If you do use a Linux distribution often, the drivers in the Ubuntu distros for the wifi card are not spectacular. I get lots of disconnects. I tried to hunt down a better version back in October to no avail, although I should probably check again, since it is a newer wifi chipset and a new driver may have been released...The keyboard is really stellar. The key sizes are consistent and well-spaced. Typing is really quite nice on it.The screen sucks, although I am picky. I also don't count this against the review, since less expensive laptops never have nice screens (with the exception of ASUS's 1005HA netbook). Viewing angles are limited, but there is a sweet spot that is pretty tolerable.You can purchase the UL30VT-X1 for $150 more if you want overclockability and Nvidia GT210M graphics. In the end, I wish I would have, as a nicer video card and faster CPU would hit the sweet spot for me (although it wasn't available when I purchased this). However, this is a lot of laptop for the price, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something faster than a netbook with great battery life and portability.", "Date": "December 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "An Amazing Laptop for the $$$", "Author": "Jared S.

I returned it within the first 30 days because I just wasn't impressed with this laptop at all. MAYBE it could be argued that it's worth $600 but I decided that I'd rather take that amount and put it toward a better laptop.Construction leaves a LOT to be desired. It's made out of hard plastic, maybe that's the norm these days, but I didn't find it sturdy enough to be confident that nothing would damage it easily.In all honesty, this laptop was literally NO FASTER (and in some cases slower) than my 5 year old Sony Vaio laptop. I was pretty astonished by this and had expected that technology would have improved more in the last 5 years than this. My vaio has a single core, 2.0 Ghz processor, a 100 GB hard drive (5400 rpm) and 2G RAM. I haven't done anything on either laptop other than the normal web browsing and using common programs like Microsoft office, pdfs, play music and watch dvds.I also found Windows 7 to be INCREDIBLY resource heavy and slow! I even put it in XP mode - looks and functions like XP, no frills. And still it was eating up my memory and this thing comes with 4g RAM!I honestly am not happy with Microsoft, nor was I happy with this product. I'm one of those who never saw a problem with Windows XP in the first place to necessitate an upgrade. I think everyone knows that Vista was a huge fail and really, I think the only reason why people are so excited about Windows 7 is because Vista was so bad that 7 now looks like a life saver in comparison. I'll stop my rant now.If you don't have high expectations than you might be satisfied with this computer. It was very light, I can say that about it, and it did look pretty nice with incredible battery life. But otherwise I think it'd be wiser to take your $600 and put it toward a better system.

The keyboard is surprisingly nice to type on. It's by far the best laptop keyboard I've ever used. I thought it might be a little cramped, but it's virtually the same size as full-sized laptop keyboards. The multitouch pad is nice and very intuitive to use.

They could tone down the gloss on the screen, too. The touchpad is a little sensitive, as others have said, but it really hasn't caused me much trouble, and I figure it can be fixed by tweaking the settings a bit. I haven't noticed the chassis squeaking that some reviewers have complained about. Also, it comes with a lot of Asus bloatware installed, but that's easy enough to remove. The dual partition setup on the hard drive is a little more annoying, but it can be fixed.If you don't want the drive split in two partitions, just go into the built-in system recovery utility BEFORE you set up the computer by pressing F9 during bootup. Then you can recover Windows to the entire hard drive rather than just the first partition.

The ASUS SmartLogOn software was a cool feature initially, until I tried to use Skype for a video call with my wife.  Apparently the SmartLogOn facial recognition software runs continuously in the background, which makes it so that no other programs can use the webcam.  Unfortunately it seems like this problem has been brought up to ASUS several times with no posted resolution or software update to the SmartLogOn software.  Until ASUS pays attention, the best solution seems to be uninstalling the SmartLogOn software and restarting your notebook, which worked for me.  What is otherwise a budget friendly thin and light with a great feature set (for what I needed), is hindered by the fact that it doesn't even work with the ASUS webcam image capture software much less Skype, YouTube, GoogleTalk etc out of the box... which is really really sad.

Don't look anything else.The color is also nice black. The laptop is everthing that they said to be(except one little fact, I will discuss below)I ordered the laptop for my school use(I am in health professional school), and program didn't run on my previous netbook(LG X130, they are super fast and reliable netbook by the way). UPS, lost my shipment and thankfully Amazon.com acted fast and got my laptop pretty fast(I am always amazed with Amazon's service).First time I unwrapped it, it was beauty. So light without battery, I thought i was just picking up 1-subject notebook. Even with battery it is way much lighter than my 1-subject binder(some papers inside). The screen size is great, sound great, the touch pad works great. Here is some pros and cons.Pros:1. Nice looking laptop2. Very portable(light and thin, weight just about same or less than my 10inch netbook)3. window 7 works fast after some tweak and after remove bloatwares.4. Touch pad works great.5. Mac-like keyboard with great feedback and comportable size.6. Very cool(temperature wise) laptop. put on your belly and never felt heat.7. Very well-built(it's solid feeling. My unit's battery fits perfectly without any empty space(battery doesn't feel lose it all, once you lock it)8. FAST. I don't know about quad core, but for dual core and portable laptop it's faster than you ever needs.(I can't say anything about hard-core game play because I don't play games on my laptop. I play on my Xbox360 or PS3)9. Good HDMI connect with plenty USB plugs.10. Sound is above average laptop speaker.11. Screen is nice except the glossy-feel.(it doesn't really bother me)Cons:1. In US model, the right Shift is smaller than I would like to be (first few times I pressed 'up' button instead of right SHIFT key).- this is biggest cons to me.2. battery does not last as advertised. But they to last pretty long(~8 to 9 hours with lower brightness. Brightness controls most of battery drain in my opinion)3. Angle of view(this is complain from my friend. I personally use this is personal laptop and doesn't want too many people to see what I do on laptop in class or in public. so I like this feature but everyone have different preference)I am somewhat laptop lover and collector(I usually buy laptops every 6month and not really into desktop, that's my dad's specialty), I own about 5 laptops(including 17inch samsung laptop and ACER TIMELINE, Dell xps laptop, etc)and couple of Netbooks(eeepc 901, LG Xnote X130) at this moment(countless previous laptops since the 8-bit and 16-bit computer). I would rather carry around UL30a-x5 than netbook. Netbooks are great but too small and performance is nowhere close to regular laptop. I would probably compare this to ACER timeline, but in most all of spec-wise, ASUS beats ACER(Acer's timeline is great thin laptop but built quality is no where near my standard)ASUS is pretty well-established company, and they know what consumer wants. They have evolved alot since eeepc. I recommended Asus to my friends and they love it. You can't ignore the 'free 1-time replacement' deal.(I have never used it but feels like good insurance).So, if you are looking to by thin stylish laptop, that is for school or personal use, not hard-core game, then don't hasitate to buy this one. You will not regret it.P.S: with Wi-fi issue, I never had any problems(I have to admit, I was worried about this issue before I purchased UL30A-x5, but didn't happen to me).

Bear in mind that I had tried an ACER ultralight and already knew I was willing to give up a built in DVD in exchange for lighter weight. I already had an external LG DVD writer that I used with my netbook, which is now gathering dust.  The screen is bright and vivid with outstanding contrast and excellent response. I have adapted to glossy, reflective screens and do not use it where glare would be a problem. Internet TV looks fine but darker DVD movies don't show well. The hardware can handle the video fine but the screen image is often too shadowy (not sure of the technical term for this). There is a built in utility that is designed to optimize the screen settings for different purposes but I have not experimented with it, since I rarely watch DVD's on my laptop. The build quality is good, though there are a couple of spots where the plastic gives a bit, as though the frame pieces did not mesh exactly. If this were an issue for me, I would have spent twice as much and bought a Lenovo. The touchpad has taken some getting used to, and it does respond to accidental thumb strikes when typing.

It's become a cliche, but my overall sense is that everything seems to \"just work\" -- the power button is right where I would have put it, the keyboard layout seems natural, there is no obvious bottleneck in doing ordinary things, the cool features are understated and don't draw unnecessary attention to themselves, and the balance seems just right when you pick it up with one hand.", "Date": "January 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great notebook, but not perfect", "Author": "PnNm", "ReviewID": "R2WO3U2TNSEIK0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "From the reviews here, you would think that this computer is perfect (i.e. with not one flaw). I got mine a few days ago, and I can tell you it's as close to perfect as you will find in a laptop.  I was a netbook early adopter (EeePC 701, with a roomy 4 GB solid-state hard drive!), and was left unsatisfied by the small screen size (7\") and the severe lack of computing power.  Needless to say, the ASUS UL30A is a step up in terms of performance and features, and one that manages to keep the light weight and small form factor.First of all, the computer is beautiful: thin and polished.  However, I don't think it will turn heads the way the Dell Vostro v13 will.  I especially like the island keyboard and the brushed aluminum cover. And it's not just looks, this computer has a big hard drive, plenty of DDR3 memory, and a good Core 2 Duo processor.But what drew me towards this laptop was the impressive battery life.  Although I'm not getting the quoted 12 hours of battery life (more like 8 hours), I am very happy with being able to go through a day's work or a plane trip on one charge.  The Power4Gear software is a rarity: an OEM software that you'd want to keep.  The default settings are pretty good, and should probably work well for most people.There's a few things I would change, however.  I would prefer to have two mousepad buttons instead of one, and the button could be a bit thicker.  The power cord connector should pull out easily, such that in case someone trips over the cord the laptop doesn't come down crashing.  Finally, I would have liked dedicated volume buttons instead of the dedicated PgUp/PgDn ones.Overall, I think this computer provides a better value than its competitors (the Vostro v13, for example).

I had to act fast and get myself a brand new laptop since I need one for basically everything I do in life. So the first thing I did was check out amazon to see what kind of laptops they had and their specs and prices. This laptop's description immediately caught my eye. Thin and light? 12 hour battery?! That would be amazing after the fat and heavy, 10 minute battery laptop I used to have. The price looked really good as well. But being the frugal shopper that I am, I decided not to act too quickly and go to my local Best Buy, Costco, and Fry's before I make any decision. Everything they had in the stores did not even compare to this laptop in my eyes. Yes, some computers had the new i3, i4, and i5 processors, and other spiffy specs, but that really did not mean too much to me. As a college student all I was looking for was something that was: 1) very portable, 2) long battery life-- have you any idea how irritating it is to find a darn outlet inside a large lecture hall? 3) ~13 inches--anything bigger is too bulky to carry around 4) affordable 5) any operating system other than Vista. This computer best fit my criteria, and after reading all the positive reviews about it, I decided to place the order.I just received my laptop yesterday, and I have to say. It's beautiful. The first thing I noticed when I took the computer out of its box was that it was very sleek looking, slim, and super light. Great! I open the laptop and I see a BUNCH of stickers and protective coverings. No problem, everything came off clean. The only thing I noticed was that the touch pad area had residual stickiness that made it very difficult to slide my finger across the pad. But the stickiness seemed to just vanish after using it a little, and it works great. I like how it isn't the traditional touch pad, but has little dots that sense your finger instead. Setup was pretty simple. I let it do its thing for about 10-15 minutes, then it asked me to make a username and password, and set up my internet connection and it was good to go. The keyboard is very nice to type on too. One of my friends pointed out that the design looked similar to that of a macbook. It comes pre-installed with a couple Asus programs that I probably would never use as well as some anti-virus program that I had never head of. But that was pretty easy to deal with. Uninstalling programs doesn't take a genius. So far everything has been running very smoothly, no issues to report yet.My only beef with this laptop is that it does not have a DVD drive, and I depended on my old laptop to burn DVDs and CDs as well as hook it up to my TV to watch movies. They don't really advertise this fact on the product description, so I was pretty sad about that. So I go back on Amazon and notice that a lot of the people who purchased this laptop also bought Asus's external DVD drive/recorder, so of course I had to take a look. It was just what I was missing, so I go ahead and buy that as well. Problem solved! I guess the lack of a DVD drive just a sacrifice we have to make in exchange for how light this laptop is.I actually took this laptop with me to work yesterday and my manager really liked it. He then called out a couple more of his staff to take a look. It was amusing to watch them all crowd around my computer and admire it. But anyway, all in all, if you are considering buying this laptop, I would say go for it. Especially if you have similar criteria to mine.

Just don't play mmo's or use torrents and don't use youtube sparingly unless your in a hotspot and you should be well under the 5gb limit.Furthermore you should check out DUO touch which can turn you laptop into a tablet pc. it's actually only awkward looking but in someways better (definitely cheaper) than buying an actual tablet pc. you can turn you laptop upside down so that the screen is where your keybaord should be and manually invert the screen in control panel. Excellent for a thin and light like this. DUO = $120.I'll try these things and if they work well I'll update this review.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "nice for the price, power, silence and the size", "Author": "parah salin \"gimme wind\"", "ReviewID": "R204GV2554YDI2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Display is glossy. hand resting spots below keyboard are shiny and get greasy fast with your palms on them. mouse pad is sick, but sensitive cuz its close to the space bar. good looking brushed metal top, wish it were on the inside too, so it wouldnt get so greasy and catch dust. makes no noise at all, running processor intensive software and parallel computing..might breathe hard sometimes and feel warm air out the side, but i guess this ulv processor is the way to go...battery only lasts 5.5 hours in windows with all my stuff installed and only browsing the internet, maybe in asus mode it lasts longer if you're just surfing or chating or listening to music on some headphones. display does flash when i plug in the hdmi sometimes, others its fine...and the audio works sometimes, others not. i found you just have to cycle thru the display options with the fn button and itll work. very light weight, again, wish it were all brushed metal cuz sometimes i feel like i'm squeezing it when i hold it like a book to my side, and ive noticed there is a spot where it does rub that has begun to fade. and its so small i wouldnt mind it being a bit more robust with a little more weight.", "Date": "January 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "G.

The mousepad is sticky: the fingers don't slide easily (my ACER netbook worked great).  When speaking with an ASUS tec rep, I turned the laptop over to read the model number for him and a tic-tic-tic... sounded for 15 seconds (maybe a fan?).  He didn't know what it might have been.  I bought a security cable only to find out that the ASUS hole is too small for the cable size I bought (the only size I could find).  When I do find a small diameter cable I worry that it will be hard to manage because it is very close to the power input plug.  The user manual that came with the laptop is a few pages only.  I tried to set up Speech Recognition, but it couldn't hear any sound.  I phoned a tec rep to ask where the builtin microphone is and after literally being on hold for almost 15 minutes while he looked for the location, I hung up and rephoned.  This rep, after some time, located the pinhole mike and we established that it was working (but not enough for Speech Recog).  He also told me how to download the full manual.  Before I found out a regular manual exists, I phoned tec support to find out what the 4 symbols mean that are just below the mousebar; another 5 minutes to determine what they represent.  I spoke with 3 men and all had accents very hard to understand (located in Freemont CA) (but I have lost some hearing, so maybe that was the problem); one woman was easy to understand.  Yesterday (I've had the laptop 2 days) the screen went crazy; the battery indicator said 2 hours+ remained, but when I plugged in the power the screen returned to normal.  For a 64 bit dual core, it seems slow, but that could be an Internet problem.  I am no expert with laptops, and I wish ASUS would make things easier for us novices.
