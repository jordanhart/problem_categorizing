Bought this Dell for size of screen & keyboard--husband has large fingers. Other smaller keyboards too sensitive. We didn't want expensive touch screen. This keyboard easy to use, mouse pad works well, screen excellent pixalls & color, great price for quality product (so far). We had Windows7 so had to adapt to Windows8, different but easy to use, change always frightens folks but I like Windows8 so far. Has some software loaded we didn't need but computers are packaged that way. Comes with Windows security & free McAfee security. The Dell was easy to set up & configure, no book manual to store in desk since tutorial is loaded right up front for you. Dell weight is kinda heavy for back pack but great for lap, desk or sitting in bed. Speakers are ok but after market are better for music & video lovers. We didn't need large data storage so this Dell brings price down. Would buy again, BUT, we bought Square Trade warranty since we haven't gotten quality China products lately--damn shame!! Important NOTE: don't leave laptop turned on atop bed covers or cloth, can cause heat build up & fire--a college student died in bed after falling asleep with it on.", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for a great price", "Author": "Victoria J. Mejia-Gewe", "ReviewID": "R33OBC35UONZFL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had to make the difficult move from an old Toshiba laptop with XP to finding a new laptop that would have Windows 8. My husband and I have been very satisfied with this purchase in the couple months we've owned this computer. I like the large screen that is nicer on my eyes than others, which easily trigger migraines in me.I won't go into technical details because I'm not a computer techie. I merely found some laptops that interested me, and I called the Amazon computer help desk for assistance in understanding which model best fit our needs. Imagine how impressed I was when the woman from Amazon actually recommended the cheaper model, since I'm nit a gamer, and the only added benefit from that model was in playing computer games.So far, we love the computer and have not had any problems at all since we got it!And how can you go wrong with this great price?", "Date": "November 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far So good", "Author": "T. Marshall \"alden\"", "ReviewID": "R9QYZAW6KMZ5M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was able to easily upgrade to 8GB buying a single 4GB memory module for $40, and I found this laptop on refurb for about 330 with no problems at all.  Plastic on back seems a bit flimsy, more like a hard black rubber, but it works.  Easy if slow to upgrade to 8.1 and to fix the minor OS issues, the only issue I had was that WiFi was higher priority than Ethernet, this is a matter of moving the Ethernet network over the Wifi in network management.  Like the big screen and higher resolution and low power CPU.", "Date": "October 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Happy", "Author": "Theresa M.

Dell support is a delight, they stay with you until you are satisfied and even ask that you call back if not.  They will gladly connect your (any name) printer to your Dell lap top, etc.  I'm very pleased with my new Dell 17-3721 lap top and recommend that you purchase the same.  Great product, excellent buy.

Larger keys for large hands is a plus along with the large screen for easy viewing not requiring reading glasses.  Windows 8 works fine since an upgrade from XP was necessary.

After being on the phone with them for an hour, we decided to send it in for repair. I use this computer for business and had important information on it that I was unable to backup. They said they would back everything up for me at no charge. After a week I received the computer back with a note on it saying they could not fix it. I called Dell support. They informed me since I had information I didn't want erased, they could not work on it. I explained what I was told prior to sending it in. They said for $120.00 they would back everything up. I was on the phone with them for 3 1/2 hours. I was transfered to 9 different people. After being on the phone they realized that everything on the computer was already erased! Since they felt so horrible, they decided they would send someone out to the house to replace the hard drive. Lets hope this computer does not break again! Very upset!

I also play games on Facebook with it.  I love the dimpled finish, not that it hides fingerprints or anything, I just like it.  Two complaints:  a) the placement of the mouse.  It is centered on the Keyboard, not including the numeral pad and it just feels...  Off!  I think the placement of the mouse should be centered on the surface of the whole keypad, not just the letters.  I purchased a wireless mouse for use with it.  b) Windows 8!!!
