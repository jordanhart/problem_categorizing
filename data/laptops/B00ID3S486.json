Shipping was fast and product arrived in new condition. I set it up in the company conference room to put it throuhg its paces. All of the usb's, the disc drive, VGA output wireless etc. worked fine. The touchpad seemed inconsistent. Sometimes it responded to a light touch and sometimes it took more pressure. Vertical scrolling was reveresed so I opened the touchpad control. Reversed was checked so I un-checked. No change.I rebooted, no change. The horizontal scrolling stopped working alltogether. tried on-line support. The touchpad model in the computer wasn't covered. Called Toshiba tech support. Routed to several techs. None were familiar with installed touchpad. The last one said \"send it back\" so I did.", "Date": "April 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "SO SLOW, terrible trackpad, just awful", "Author": "P.S.", "ReviewID": "R5PIGZIQQIBW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This was supposed to be the latest and greatest, fastest processor, tons of memory...  all of that...  well, it SUCKS.  Terrible laptop, I had to return it and I might go Mac I'm so fed up with PC's.  First, this laptop is HUGE.  Second, the trackpad is awful, doesn't click right, feels weird, doesn't respond to touches well.  Third, it's so slow!  Out of the box and it took forever to open any programs or do anything.  I nearly went Office Space on it before I could return it.", "Date": "April 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "WORST laptop ever.", "Author": "G. Balint \"pointeshoes15\"", "ReviewID": "R1ET1V420NXGI6", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this a couple of months ago when it was \"S70-ABT2N22\" from the Toshiba website, and I agree with the other negative review written here; it says \"backlit\" and shows it in photos, but the one I received was NOT backlit. The mouse pad/buttons were virtually impossible to use (I had to use BOTH hands to even partially use it...I had to purchase a wireless mouse--NOT from Toshiba--the next day). Then, 7 short weeks after purchasing, it DIED. RUN don't walk from this terrible excuse for technology. Toshiba made me pay another $25 to send it back! ABSURD! Their \"customer service\" is a joke...it's been a month, and I still don't have the computer back! I was originally told \"7-10 business days\" and it would be fixed...I tried submitting a complaint to Toshiba's complaint dept and I was ignored. Never again will I purchase a Toshiba product. I encourage you to go for something reliable, like Dell or HP (and HP laptops have remote controls, \u2665\u2665\u2665)", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "excellent machine", "Author": "Carolyn S.
