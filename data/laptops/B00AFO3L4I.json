It was about the same price as what the Dell website offered, but I went with Amazon and this seller because they could ship faster and cheaper with my Prime account.I had a warranty issue so I called Dell customer service.  I had my service tag number, receipt, everything, but Dell told me the computer is registered to another owner.  I went round and around with Dell but they told me point blank that if I can't provide the name and address of the original owner they will not honor the warranty.  I asked Amazon about it and Amazon said I've got to take it up with the seller.To make a long story short, a friend helped me out and the computer works now.  If you want to buy a laptop at premium price and get no warranty and a smack down from the manufacturer, the shipper, and the seller, then buy from these guys.", "Date": "April 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "ratings", "Author": "Ryan", "ReviewID": "R1HPT1J3U3YF6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This product met my expectations.
