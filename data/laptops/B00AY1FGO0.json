Love the quad core and generous memory.  Works well.2.  Network card cannot connect to 5ghz routers.  2.4ghz is the limit.  Had to get a USB 5Ghz network adapter.3.  Toshiba phone support charges $69.95 per incident.  Hung up.  Figured out my issue later.  Saved $69.95.4.  Windows 8 is a bear imho.  Downgraded to 7.5.  Downgrading is no picnic.  There is a hardware setting to prevent booting from CD/DVD.  Took a bit to get through that.  Had to repartition the disk since the W8 file system is different than W7.  Got it working.  Not all Toshiba drivers for this laptop are Windows 7 compatible.  Spent the next 3 hours fishing for drivers.  Got it all working in the end - but what a journey.", "Date": "October 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "don't like it at all", "Author": "Alla Friedman", "ReviewID": "R2DOJLYA2UKSY5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Didn't have a chane to expirianse yhe produkt ,the mouth pad froze up right after the registration .
