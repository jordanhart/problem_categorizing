Crane", "ReviewID": "R2OV8IMNXD2OHJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The system itself is clean and came with the original disc and a good battery. The power adapter was breaking apart on the end but I had another. (Standard Dell Laptop Power Supply)My bigger issue was that the Shift Key's just didn't work, I had not even noticed the back lighting was not working until I push one of the shift keys rather hard and suddenly it started working and the back light came on. Almost like the connector was not all the way in but I could find no proof of that. It leaves me uneasy on wither or not the system will continue working or give me issues again.The laptop itself seems more than powerful enough and had no really wear to speak of besides very minor scratches on the top as described. I really with the Keyboard didn't leave me so concerned on if it will keep working for me or not.", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "not good refurbished", "Author": "Rene", "ReviewID": "R7Y56CLQDJM1K", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "it was suposed to a refurbished but it seems its just used computer with heavy wear and tear. but overall its just ok.", "Date": "February 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Money well spent!", "Author": "juneman65", "ReviewID": "R3AK5SJ3OGYVJ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this laptop because I was looking for a speedy computer at a reasonable price.

But I got the delivery and it is a very nice computer...the sound is AWFULL. Turned all the way up, it can barely be heard from 2 feet away. And although these have cameras, this one doesn't work. Contacted the seller who said that this \"particular computer doesn't have a camera...it does, just doesn't work. When asked about the sound, they said they were sorry if I was disappointed, and that I could send it back for a refund, but I don't want to be without a computer (I use it for my real estate business), and the sound & camera would be nice, but I thought that it was a simple enough request to send  me a usb camera and speaker or instruct me as to how I could try to improve/fix the audio/video on this one. Long story short, the laptop works fine and I really like it. It would be nice if I had an instruction book as I have never owned a Dell, but finding info online is not that difficult. I am grateful for the computer at a much lower price than new, and hope that it holds up for a very long time. Overall, I would order another from this seller, but ask them to verify that the onboard camera and sound are in good working order.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003O7R6JY"}}
