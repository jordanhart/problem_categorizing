I researched all possible competing laptops and none came close.  After using this product for a month, I have concluded the following:Pros:1.  Speed of computer is superb2.  Starcraft 2 on ULTRA settings run flawlessly3.  Can run multiple games (Counterstrike, diablo 3, and starcraft with no lag simultaneously)Cons:1.  Hard drive could be faster 5400rpm.  If you have a a little extra money then just replace the hard drive with a SSD.2.  Screen sometimes looks a little grey. But thats during daylight.  At night its awesome.So concluding, I would definitely recommend this to any wanting a high end gaming laptop for a reasonable price.Also, at [...]  they have an older model backpack solid black, that is a ROG official backpack for 17.3 inch laptops for 49.99.  Pick that up right away as its a great sale.", "Date": "July 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very good laptop...but", "Author": "R. Wagner", "ReviewID": "R35V4QD8S4M5CU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had the Asus G75V for nearly a year now. Very quick unit and very reliable. The only down side, and this is a big one, is the piece of crap touch pad that they use. It it total junk. The cursor jumps all over the place and selects things that you don't want to select. It does this even with the sensitivity turned way down. Using an external mouse is somewhat better but it is still annoying. Other than that I would highly recommend this unit.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Somewhat Disappointed", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R3S731PQN6BHYJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had pretty high hopes for this laptop considering the incredible reviews from multiple online retailers. The laptop is indeed very sturdy, and based on the specs seems like a really great buy. But there's a reason this laptop seems like a great deal:1. It comes with a ridiculously large amount of bloatware. Upon initial boot you'll find dozens of useless programs.2. It doesn't come with Office.3. The screen resolution is poor for the price. Definitely a visible step down from G75VW-TS72 screen.4. The touchpad has a raised bump on it. This could just be a defect with the one I received. It's just noticeable enough to be annoying.Overall I would recommend spending a little more to get a better model.", "Date": "August 8, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "ASUS G75VW-TS71 Gaming Notebook\n3rd generation Intel Core i7-3610QM 2.3GHz, 12GB DDR3, 500GB HDD, Blu-ray Player/DVDRW, 2GB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660M, 17.3\" Display, Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "ASUS G75 17.3\" i7 12GB/500GB/GTX 660M Win7 NB", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41P5TN-ttIL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B007YHMA0A"}}
