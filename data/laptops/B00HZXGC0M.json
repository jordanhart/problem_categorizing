I'd also want to note that this item is sold/shipped by a 3rd party seller not Amazon.com  Please don't buy this if priced over $259, as its being price gouged.This model: x550s is is from the budget line non-touch 15\" category by Asus.  You maybe asking your self, \"what can I get from this $250 notebook\" \"is it enough for my needs\" \"Am I wasting my time reading this lousy review?\"To give you guys an idea what type of user experience to expect from this machine, ive made this table below. rating goes form: Excellent>Average>Poor<><>Expected Performance Meter<><><>ENTERTAINMENT<>[Poor] PC Gaming or [Poor to Average] Minecraft, Microsoft Store games, Facebook Gaming[Average] Social Media surfing (Twitter,Facebook,Linkedin)[Poor] Video Chatting (Skype)[Average] Streaming Shows HD (Netlfix,Youtube,Hulu,iTunes)[Average] Music Library (iTunes,Amazon MP3,Lastfm,Spotify)<>PRODUCTIVITY<>[Average] MS Office Suite[Average] TurboTax, Quickbooks[Average] Education Free Courses (from basic algebra at Udacity to Advanced MIT's Open Courseware)<>EXPRESS YOUR CREATIVITY<>[POOR] Music Creation (create music recodings, Audacity)[POOR Photoshop editing (Photoshop Elements)[POOR] Video Editing (Sony Vegas/MovieStudio, Adobe Premier)[POOR Website development (Adobe Dreamweaver CS3)This product line has been in the market since summer 2013,  its backbone is being ran by an entry level CPU, Celeron1007U which is a processor based on IvyBridge early 2013. [CPU Passmark Score: 1642]Although it competes against other processors such as AMD E sieres or AMD A4-1200 at the same sub $320 15\" budget notbook market, this Intel Celeron1007U is +40% [CPU Passmark Score: 1642] > AMD E, A4 series [CPU Passmark Score: 650-750].  Keep that in mind...Asus has improved their overall product with this X551 series entry level notebooks.  Unlike other manufactures this budget notebook does not feel as cheap as the competition.  Its of course still made out of plastic but imo it still has a very good sturdy feel to it.Its missing an Optical Drive, although you could buy your own external usb disc drive here at amazon for less than $30 if you really need it. Preinstalled with windows 8 and not 8.1, so when you decide to get the free Windows 8.1 upgrade at MS store, expect 2.5hr upgrade time duration. Another Con is the webcam because it has a low quality picture during video calls.  If web video calls / Skype is important to you, I strongly suggest to stop reading here and look at another product.  Again this is an entry priced notebooks so sometimes companies will try to cut some corners to keep the prices down and for this model, its the camera not having HD resolution.Luckily decided not to cut corners on critical components such as the RAM and Memory.  At 4GM Ram +500 Hard Drive space its good to see no cutting corners here.  But sadly this notebook is not Ram upgradable, 4GB is its max capacity. (unconfirmed)THe keyboard layout is slightly narrow, raised but has a clicking noise. especially the space bar.THe Trackpad's surface perimeter is much wider.  Its supports multi gestures, thus the reason for the large trackpad design says Asus.  I myself would make multiple errors because my palm would accidentally rest on the trackpad while navigating. A little frustrating at first but you do get used to it after a few uses.There's nothing special on the display panel, just your regular budget TN panel at 720p resolution range.  The notebook could run hot if pushed to the limits, which is easy to do.in addition I'll also share with you guys some of my favorite picks for 2014 Amazon laptops.

An \"Administrators\" account is a backdoor route viruses/malware uses get in and cause unrecoverable distruction to your data. With Admin rights those malware can easily infect deep within your \"recovery partitions'! meaning, these's not turning back and you're royally screwed. Theres many more problems that can happen but I think you already get my point.GOALS: 1) Don't use your Main MS Account as an\" Adminitrator\" but instead \"standard\"  2) Create a secondary account called \"local account\" and set that up as the Administrator instead.Account Management: steps creating a local account(administrator) and MS Account(standard)Charms search: type\"control panel\" > \"User's Accounts and Family Safety\" > \"Remove User account\" > \" Add a new user in PC settings \" located at bottom of window > Bringing you to Metro > click \"add Account\" > \"Sign in without MS accout\" located at bottom of page > \"Local Accout\" > create new user name and PWYou have 2 options on Signing IN1) Microsoft account or 2) Local Account1) Create or sign in with your MAIN Microsoft Account. If you already an MS account or uses windows phones/ xbox live or Hotmail/live/MSN email address you can use these as well to link those services to 1 master MS Account.2) Create a Local Account. Thise secondary account will not connect to MS's ecosytem but only in your local computer. I identical to USERS login on Windows 7,Vista,XP etc.Once you've setup these two accounts, you must set each account type to: >Change ACCOUNT TYPE for Main MS Account to \"Standard\"Change ACCOUNT TYPE for 2ndary Local Account to \"Administrator\"Please do these steps, it only takes 5minutes.  Its a small price to pay considering, it may  potentially rescue your entire data from a completely erasing your data after sending it for repairs.__________________________________________________________________________Making Back ups/ EtcAnother tip is to make a recovery image.First install Setup all your programs , setup your custom settings, etcAfter personalizing your PC.  > Its time to Create a Recovery Image right after you've set everything up.  This image will allow you to revert back to this pc's state in time, and in perfect working order.Sometimes system recovery doesn't solve your problems so having secondary backup plan like Recovery Image is key.________________________________________________________________________Not optional, must practice these 3 regular computing habits.#1  (Install McAfee Antivirus, which is now free starting 2014, per Intel's 2014 Keynote at CES) or Paid programs such as Kaspersky Internet Security 2014  is the leading software in the market today. $50.  These programs scans your system automatically, so set it and forget it.#2  (Install MalwareBytes/free, scan your pc every month with this program or sooner when you feel like your system is sluggish or seeing webpages poping up that you didnt click)  Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.#3  (Install Superantispyware/free, Scan pc every 2wks)Because this is a free software, as a user you must manually start the scaning process or by buying retail version you'll unlock the auto scan scheduler feature.Its ok skip a few scans between months, although not advisable, especially if your a heavy web surfing maniac spending 2-3 hrs daily websurfing not just facebooking.  But please dont go without using all 3 programs more than 5-8 Months in between scans.________________________________________________________________________Another way to avoid  spreading your personal information out there into the wild unknowingly is to un-google yourself.yes ladies and gents! google or yahoo especially yahoo LOL..... but google is key here.Microsoft sells Primarily Software.Apple sells Primarily HardwareGoogle sells neither, that's why their products are so CHEAP, once they suckered in their backdoor ridden ecosystem, Google Inc. sells your information to advertisers,  All their services is based on mining for your data, in essense their user's becomes the \"product\" being sold!_____________________________________________________________________________________________________Steps in upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1  (2-3hrs)Key here is to ensure your windows 8 is fully updated before upgrading to win8.1Therefore repeatedly \"check of updates\" on windowsHow to upgrade to windows 8.1 for dummies.Step 1: Go to Metro and not desktopStep 2: Start typing : \"Control Panel\"Step 3: Click \"Windows Update\" > \"Check for Update\"Step 4: install updatesStep 5: restart computerStep 6: Repeat step 1 -5 until result \"no more updates\"Step 7: Run HP Update client, install all updates from HP to ensure all drivers and bugfixes are updated.( or whichever OEM you may have, lenovo,dell, sony etc.)Step 8: Uninstall your Antivirus Software (important) then RESTART PCStep 9: Go to Windows Store and upgrade to 8.1Step 10: leave computer on for 2hrs as it upgrades.Step 11: Repeat Steps 1 - 7Step 12: if you're not a complete fool, 8.1 upgrade should be straight forward. \\After steps 1-8 ONLY THEN you should install WIndows 8.1 at the marketplace. Goodluck.(note: steps above removes a lot of failures users experience after 8.1 update)___________________________________________________________Not many want to shell out their dollars on Office 360  if all they intend of using is standard word processors.you can use a free web version of office calledBing.com search:  \"MS Office Web Apps\"just sign in with the same  MS Account user name used on your PC.", "Date": "February 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "A STEAL.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2XPVZCCCY6TF8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "ASUS has one of the best motherboards out there.This computer has great ram and drive making it a real steal for the price.The first thing it noticed when I opened it was that the screen is huge!!The first thing I did was update everything, and install an antivirus, and this computer runs extremely quickly now.A lot of people who have Windows 7 are skeptics about Windows 8 or 8.1.However, the icons you usually see are just a default menu that has an icon which takes you to the window 7 desktop screen.The look is too sexy.I recommend it for anyone who is trying to buy an affordable laptop for school, recording, or anything really.BUY THIS.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "AWESOME", "Author": "Angel Gonzales", "ReviewID": "RDYWV0XEPSCYB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop came as pictured !
