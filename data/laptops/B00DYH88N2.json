{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Fast mid-range laptop", "Author": "Andrea Polk", "ReviewID": "R1E9QC3Z7YOCR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Recently I picked up this laptop locally for four hundred (very good price with these specs...).  I'm an intermediate to advanced PC user who tends to be a bit picky when it comes to speed, stability and features.  I don't do a lot of gaming, but I do enjoy photo and video editing, as well as working on my blog while listening to iTunes radio.  I need a bit more than a basic laptop such as the HP Pavilion 2000 series offers, but cannot justify paying big bucks for a Macbook at this time.  Thus when this one came up on New Years Day at such a stellar deal, I jumped at it.Sleekbooks and Ultrabooks like the Asus S500CA-SI30401U 15.6-Inch Touchscreen Ultrabook don't have DVD drives built into them. This makes them more lightweight and less bulky than laptops with these drives.That means that I'll be using an external DVD drive (USB powered)like this one: Samsung  8x Slim DVD+/-RW Slim USB External Drive, Black SE-208DB/TSBS when I want to burn a disc, play a movie on a disc or install a program that requires a disc.  These drives are only about thirty bucks, so it's really not a big deal to me.  Especially since I won't be needing it all the time.I love that this laptop has a speedy AMD A10 processor paired with 4MB of L2 cache and 6GB of RAM.  I also love that it has a full sized backlit keyboard, media reader, webcam, BEATS audio (although it's not a huge perk...), and big hard drive with upgradeable RAM to 16GB .  Bluetooth enabled and a HDMI port added in at this price point are all great selling points to me.It's a mid-range laptop that suits my need for speed and portability.  Enhanced graphics and sound make this laptop enjoyable to use for entertainment purposes such as online gaming and streaming Netflix, and pairing it with my Bluetooth headset is a breeze.NOTE: **This is NOT the touchscreen model Sleekbook.  If it says 'TouchSmart' in the description - you have a touchscreen model.TIP:  The laptop comes with Windows 8, but you can easily upgrade for FREE to Windows 8.1 on the Microsoft site in 'downloads'.  I suggest you do this out of the box, especially if you're making the move from Windows 7.  You'll gain the 'Start' button back by doing this, and some added stability upgrades.The worst I can say about it at this point is that it does get a bit warmer than expected.  Warm, but not hot, I choose to use it with a laptop cooling pad: Cooler Master NotePal X-Slim Ultra-Slim Laptop Cooling Pad with 160mm Fan (R9-NBC-XSLI-GP) when I have it at my desk.  I do not notice any extreme fan noise which to me would indicate the PC is working too hard to stay cool, which is good.  (Will update the review if that changes with extended use.)Overall, I'm very pleased with this purchase.  I would recommend this laptop to others who want a bit more bells and whistles than the average budget PC with the potential for up to 5 hours of battery life, but don't want to pay a premium price for the perks.UPDATE: 1/5/14Great graphics and camera on this one! Plays games like Battlefield 3 without a hitch.  Very fast - but it does run hotter than some, so get a Cooler Master NotePal X-Slim Ultra-Slim Laptop Cooling Pad with 160mm Fan (R9-NBC-XSLI-GP) or similar to assist in keeping things cool. You may also note a bit more noise from the hard drive than some other laptops.  I think it may be due to the thin nature of this one - without the DVD drive to diffuse some of the noise in the case.**I did buy (2) of these - one has a slightly larger hard drive and touch screen. It too runs hot, but if the prices are compatible, I'd choose it for the touch screen functionality.
