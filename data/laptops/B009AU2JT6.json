I did have to go through a lengthy setup process with HP Support (by phone), but they did that mostly by remoting-in to the computer (so that I didn't have to do all that much myself).  The support had mostly to do with installing all of the software updates to the Operating System which had been issued since the computer was first built.At any rate.... once that was all completed it's been running full-tilt for nearly two months with NO issues at all.  Batttery life is really good, and it gives ample warning when the level it getting low.The \"form factor\" (size) as well as its having a solid-state drive (as opposed to a spinning hard drive), REALLY make it perfect for my mobile lifestyle..  I am far less \"afraid\" to take it along on a car ride or bumpy subway...It's a KEEPER!", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent machine", "Author": "Tango Mike Alpha", "ReviewID": "R1SIVST7NZROGN", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First I want to say that this is my first ultrabook. I am not going to repeat what other reviewers have said but I would just like to say a few things:1. this is by no competition the single fastest devise I ever have. I intentionally say devise since it boots even faster than any of my smart phones, tablets, or even my old but trusty Nokia E63 (not so smart) phone. this includes logging in and connecting to the local WiFi.2. on the downside, there is only a single thing that I wish HP has done right: the activity LEDs. now placing these on the side is not a smart idea since it simply becomes irrelevant. I'm (and other people probably) not going to lean to the side of my laptop each time I want to know if the HDD (SDD) is busy. this should have been placed on top, preferably by the power button where it is always visible.I will update this once something new happens.Update 18/Sep/2013I have two more cons that I discovered from day to day usage:1. The keyboard is not that good. SHIFT sometimes does not register, some keys (nothing particular) also fail to register or register as adjacent keys. Now some might say that this is me typing wrong, believe me this is not the case. Most of the time anyway.2. The touch pad buttons are a joke. right clicking results in left clicking most of the time, so I was forced to use a mouse. this makes the point of carrying and using an ultrabook simply mute. The multi-touch feature is AWESOME though. Zooming, and scrolling have never been easier. Only wish the buttons would work as they're supposed to.I still consider this the best PC experience I've had since upgrading my AMD 100 to Intel Pentiom 233 MMX which is why I just can't bring myself to take another star", "Date": "August 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Extremely disappointed in HP", "Author": "Ok", "ReviewID": "R1FK4ZQTGBF2PG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The screen of this laptop is literally about to snap off. The left hinge is snapping off and taking the screen with it. This happened within the first couple months of owning the laptop. On top of all of this several screws have fallen out making clicking of the trackpad shoddy. This is the laptop from hell. Never purchasing another HP product again in my life.Words cannot express how saddened I am how this company treats their customers. All representatives are very rude and disrespectful. It is actually impossible to speak with anybody that can help you. The Philippines transfer me to India, India transfers me to Philippines, Philippines transfer me to California, California transfers me back to executive office in the Philippines. I wish I was making this stuff up.

I go to college and I have to bring my laptop to school often, so I wanted something small and lightweight.  I looked at dell (which was what my previous laptop was), but nothing interested me.  I even looked at a Macbook Air, but then I realized I didn't want a Mac for a computer.  Then I found this Ultrabook and the specs were everything I wanted.  Also, I have never saw a better looking computer than this.  The brushed look is amazing and the light up keyboard is awesome.  Besides the looks, this computer is extremely fast for being so thin.  I haven't done anything that makes this computer lag yet.  The beats audio sounds nice and it can get very loud for an Ultrabook.  Also, for it's purpose of taking it to school, it is so light that I sometimes get scared that I forgot it at home, which is great.Of course, this Ultrabook isn't perfect.  One reason is that the touch pad is sometimes erratic.  Sometimes I try to move the pointer slightly and it jumps to somewhere else.  Also, I don't like when the left and right buttons are attached to the touch pad because sometimes when I am trying to click something, the pointer moves and I miss whatever I am trying to click.  These aren't big problems, but they can be irritating at times.  I use a mouse at almost all times, so it doesn't affect me most of the time.  The other problem is not really the computer's fault, but the computer comes with it.  The problem is of course Windows 8, which is horrible.  I have never used the app mode of Windows 8 because it's useless and more difficult to use, so I just use desktop mode all the time.  The only reason why I keep Windows 8 on this computer is because it is somewhat faster than Windows 7.Besides those small problems, I really love this Ultrabook!", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "great product!", "Author": "ALICIA HAMMOND", "ReviewID": "R4E5HV1NYXY4C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "lightweight, fast and sleek! windows 8 took a little time to get used to, but otherwise, it's a fantastic purchase!", "Date": "April 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent sleep/wake-up times", "Author": "Poulomi Pal", "ReviewID": "RDVUD92SFHR2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Starts up and wakes up within seconds.

First let's hit the good points.  It is small and light.  It has a solid state drive. It is fast enough for basic tasks. That is about it.1) Crummy low-resolution screen.  Most android phones have higher resolution.  The ONLY way this laptop is useful for productivity work is with external monitors (I added 2). It is bright enough, and viewing angle is decent.2) 4 GB ram soldered in - that is right no upgrade to 8 or 16 GB.3) weak island keyboard - this is true of most recent laptops, but please somebody offer a real keyboard.4) average touchpad with no individual buttons.  I would never buy myself any laptop without a pointer stick in the keyboard, perhaps I'm out of touch, but I find them much easier to use.I would NEVER consider buying one of these.  If I were to consider a laptop with similar features, it would need to be in an 11\" size to make it easier to travel with and cost about 1/2 as much, because the value is very poor.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "HAd to send this junk laptop 2 times foor warranty for a just 4 months old laptop, really bad quality and hardware of HP laptops", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RUZ30FZ01WRDV", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop more or less 4 months ago, and since then I have had to send it to HP warranty service 2 times!!!It's incredible how bad this laptop is considering the price isn't as cheap as other laptops.
