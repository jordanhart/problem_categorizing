{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Has the potential to be better", "Author": "Vic", "ReviewID": "RZMQI4B6RB3ZM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Being a loyal HP consumer for more than a decade, I feel that their 2000-2B16NR model fell short from impressing me in terms of performance. In a one-week period, I have had several blue screens of death after performing critical Windows Updates. Its AMD E1-1200 1.4GHz CPU can barely handle two Firefox Tabs (websites like Facebook, Youtube, and Pandora perform poorly) and the Task Manager without hitting the 100% speed limit. According to the store where I purchased this device, Fingerhut, claimed that the laptop had two RAM sticks of 2GB each. Since I am a PC geek, I discovered that it only had one 4GB RAM @ DDR3/PC3-12800 stick--which explains why the CPU struggles to handle more than one task online.UPDATE (5-5-2013): I can't even watch online HD videos effectively even with high-speed, 15-mbps internet. What's the point of having an HD video card?Recommendation to HP and those who own this model: to enhance your laptop's performance, get a bang for the buck, and if you're running on 64-bit Windows 8, UPGRADE YOUR RAM (if you have 4GB, boost it to 8GB).", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Computer and reasonable price.", "Author": "Jim", "ReviewID": "R2Z7E0FKYTBJKH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great Computer and reasonable price.The HD is large enough and 4g ram is really good.

This is my first HP computer I normally buy Toshiba. I wasn't too impressed with the speed, so increase the RAM to 8gb and put in a WD scorpio black hard drive. After that i could tell a big difference in the performance.  Now its pretty good for how cheap it was. Im not a big fan of Windows 8. I liked 7 a lot better. But Windows 8 isn't that hard to navigate, its just a big learning curve. All in all the computer is good for everyday use and watching movies. I wouldn't use this for gaming if thats your sort of thing.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awful", "Author": "lollypop", "ReviewID": "RH706WY7Y3QO6", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have now had this Notebook for about four months and it is pretty awful.  I have had a lot of laptops through work and for personal use and this is by far the worst one I have ever had.  Many, many blue screens of death, restarts, etc.  I had to stop using Mozilla Firefox as my browser because this device could not seem to handle it  - it would just shut down.  Typing is almost impossible because the cursor just seems to move and jump around.  You'll be typing a sentence and then it will suddently just start inserting your words somewhere else in the document, e-mail, etc.  Very frustrating.  Now, the screen has gone completely blank.  I can tell that everything is on, but, I can't see anything.  I've tried connecting to an external monitor and I only get a quick flash of the screen before it too goes blank.  I do not recommend this laptop at all.  I have told my kids that if they can somehow fix it, they can have it.  I will go buy something else; and, not an HP after this experience.", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "My Workhorse", "Author": "Kilt Master", "ReviewID": "R3GM3VNWUO2QUT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I need a laptop for my work, and this one does everything I need.

When my Dell hit 10 years of age, I made the mistake of buying this piece of junk.  It is 11 months old, and has suffered two (2) failed hard drives and one failed motherboard.  When it dies, they send you a box in which to return it.  I saved the box - I'll probably need it again.  Good battery life, nice display, poor keyboard (and like another reviewer, I sometimes get the cursor jumping problem), but no good qualities can overcome the lack of reliability.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "hp laptop", "Author": "hp", "ReviewID": "R303BU0SKY0YPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The laptop is per expectation and beyond.
