It is exactly as advertised and performs well.  I read that others have had problems with the battery, but I've had no problems with mine.  If it continues to perform as well as it does now, I will be completely satisfied.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "HP Refurbished System", "Author": "Carol", "ReviewID": "R33MOP79Q4MP97", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The item itself is in great shape.  I was able to load my software without problems and software works well.  I need to purchase a new battery.  Battery does not charge while plugged into wall.  Icon says \"not charging\".  Disappointed but age has its problems.I don't recall if the ad said battery was or was not in working order.  System has lots of speed.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Simply Mahvelous", "Author": "MasonB", "ReviewID": "R1FX53YEU9UD5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Yep - a positive review on a refurbished computer.  Simply Mahvelous!I waited a time before writing this review.  I bought this laptop for traveling - AND because - at $200.00 - it was so Cheap!  Whenever we get a REALLY good deal in the human society, there is serious cause for pessism.  If you buy from a bear or a frog - no problem.  Just take it home and use it.  No need to ask any questions.  You don't see them screwing each other over for a few dishonest dollars.  But humanity is a different animal - and of course - I thought the thing would have spat up something disgusting - and died by now.I used it for a time on my treadmill, etc, and, as it was still with us- eventually set it up for my wife - who loves the blazing speed of the thing.  Just have a look at those specs.  This computer isn't a dog, and it isn't GrandMa's computer system either.  With Win 7 installed, and more horse power than you can shake a stick at - this computer REALLY performs.There are no anomalous behaviors with the thing either.  Unexplained shutdowns, weird crashes, blank screens, dead peripherals (however temporary) NONE of that.  Just solid computing power you can sit your website and critical applications on top of - and DEPEND on it when the chips are down.It came well packaged and well protected from damage.  So why only four stars?  The unit shipped with an old battery that won't stay charged for the expected time.  In a day or two, it will discharge - even if not under use.  That may not seem like a big deal - and it isn't (I guess) - but it makes me wonder if a company realizes that it shoots itself in the foot when doing something like this.  Had they installed a decent battery, I could have recommended the thing whole-heartedly.  AS things are, however - I have to raise the spector of Caveat Emptor.Anyway - want a good computer for $200 or even LESS?  Consider a refurbished HP Laptop like this one.  I think you will be pleasantly surprised.", "Date": "April 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "14\" HP Refurbished Laptop", "Author": "ron", "ReviewID": "R39RPNJGKGC93D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to admit I was somewhat concerned ordering a refurbished office laptop...even from HP of whom I already own 3 others....but all brand new. After putting it to the test for a few weeks, I found it to be quite acceptable in every way . The clarity of the widescreen & the speed of the processor will make it the pefect laptop to be my secondary computer.  HP will always be my brand of choice in computers !!", "Date": "September 3, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B005AKRF12"}}
