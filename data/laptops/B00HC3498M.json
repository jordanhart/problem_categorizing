This computer is great for that. The graphics card is the best you can get for a $600 budget so you can run games but you will have to turn down the settings on the newest games. Windows 8.1 isn't so bad coming from XP or 7 once you install classic shell. Webcam is great quality. Touchpad is nice and big and works well. Two downsides though: speakers are low quality on the bottom. Sound ok sitting on a solid desk though. No CD/DVD drive. You'll have to buy an external one for about $30 if you want one. Neither of these things were selling points for me but just be advised.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Hard to beat, dollar for dollar.", "Author": "Matthew", "ReviewID": "R2W09ACXIKPJZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this laptop for about a week and I don't regret the purchase yet. This is not a fancy, brushed aluminum ultrabook (plastic construction- but attractive) but it isn't a big clunker either. I think if you got a deal in this price range, you might get something a little more ergonomically refined but that isn't why you're going to buy this one...What set this one apart was specs:core i5- 4200U8BG ramDedicated graphics card.Under 600 bucks.It's one of the few options in this range with that much RAM and a dedicated graphics card. So far it is blowing through normal tasks. I've downloaded libre Office and set up my desktop without a hitch. Also installed LOTR and is running fine at reasonably high settings. If you are looking for a budget laptop with a good processor and the dedicated graphics card to maybe play a game once in a while, then I'm not sure there is anything in this price range that can beat this one.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "I am happy with this purchase.", "Author": "I <3 Amazon", "ReviewID": "RA0O4P6PFGBUH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this laptop from Amazon on February 28th, and I received it on March 6th.  I went with the standard (and free) shipping service.I am writing this review on March 27, three weeks after I received the laptop.I ordered this laptop so that I could play Second Life, which runs entirely on OpenGL (instead of DirectX).My previous laptop was a HP Pavilion dv6875se that had a 15.6\" screen, glossy casing, NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS, and Duo Core CPU.  In comparison to that one, this Acer's NVIDIA GeForce Gt 820M rezzes textures noticeably faster and I have a better FPS in the game.  Also, the Second Life game only uses like 10-25% CPU on this Acer, whereas on my previous HP Pavilion it used 70-100% (when it gets to 95-100%, it freezes up the computer).  The 14\" screen is a good size screen for me.  I thought bigger was better, but I had tried a Lenovo Z710 with a 17.3\" screen and it was more screen than I needed.  This laptop is also only 4.63 lbs, instead of the 6.14 lbs that my previous laptop was.  I also like how the casing isn't as much as a fingerprint magnet as the HP was.  I like how the casing is a Misty Silver, instead of White, and I like the dotted pattern design on the casing.  Oh, and the HP Pavilion would drive me nuts because it had a QuickPlay control button area that would power on the computer with the slightest brush of your hand.  I know that it is expected that this Acer would out-perform my old HP, because it is newer, but I'm just really happy that I traded up and now have a better computer that does all I need and want it to do.My HP died on me on January 11, 2014, and I was looking at computers in the $600-850 range.  There were two Acers that I was interested in, but one was Sold Out and the other had an AMD Crossfire GPU.  After some research, I learned that AMD GPU's are not as OpenGL friendly as NVIDIA GPU's, and that the Crossfire technology does not work with Second Life.  In fact, one expert on the Toms Hardware website, and an Amazon customer who purchased the Acer w/AMD Crossfire, explained to me that it only used the Dedicated GPU on newer games that ran on DirectX 10 or 11.  If you had an older game that ran on DirectX 9, or OpenGL, it would only use the Integrated GPU (even if your settings told it to use the better GPU).  So after learning that I could not purchase the Sold Out Acer, or the Acer w/ AMD Crossfire GPU, I started looking at other laptops.  I started to shy away from Acer because it seemed that the other Acer laptops that had Dedicated GPUs were a bit pricier and I noticed some weirdness with the keyboards.  The Enter key was L-shaped, and on some of the Acer laptops, some keys were moved around.  Like the |\\ key was moved to the bottom left, where it should be above the Enter key.  So that's when I started looking at other brands like ASUS and Lenovo.  I ended up buying a Lenovo Z710 on February 10, 2014, and it was a horrible experience.  After updating from Windows 8.0 to 8.1, installing all required software updates, and downloading my game, my game crashed a hundred times a day due to OpenGL driver, kernel driver, and TDR issues.  FYI, I tried every single recommended fix, and none of them worked.  Each time that the game crashed, I could not start it back up again (I did try closing the process from the Task Manager).  I had to reboot the computer every time the game crashed, because it was a graphic card failure.  Also, the error messages would flood my screen, and would keep opening up one after another. Closing them would not do any good.  So, in the end, I had to return the Lenovo, and that is when I discovered this new Acer E1-472G-6648 that was in my price range.  One thing about these 14\" Acers that I like is that it doesn't have a Numerical Keypad on the right hand side.  I much prefer the keyboard on these 14\" ones over the Acers that have the 15.3\" screens.So about my experience with this laptop so far.  My first impression was that the keyboard was a bit difficult to use and hurt my fingers.  But after a week, I have grown completely used to it, and the keyboard is a part of my fingers now.  I like how solid the keys feel and how they have a textured surface on them.  The touch-pad mouse also has textured feel to it, but one bad thing about it is that it is ultra sensitive.  Just the heat from my left palm was enough to make my mouse cursor move around.  Thankfully Acer is awesome and they have a FN + F7 Key combo that disables the touch-pad mouse.  Since I am always using a wireless USB mouse, I don't see a reason to deduct a star here.  The USB ports were a bit tight at first, but now I can get things in and out of them with no problem.  The headphone/microphone jack is close to the left USB port, but not enough to deduct one or 1/2-1/4 stars.  The entire design and the features (webcam, speakers, etc.) are good and work fine, so I am happy.  The only thing I would have changed is the Enter key.  I don't get why it is L-Shaped, but it is no big deal.  The keys are all conveniently placed, easy to find, and easy to get to.One thing you will love about this particular Acer is that it comes pre-loaded with Windows 8.1 instead of Windows 8.0.  That saves you the time and hassle of installing all the Windows 8.0 updates, downloading Windows 8.1 from the Windows Store, and then installing Windows 8.1.  For those of you who don't like or are scared of Windows 8.1, don't be.  I freaking hated the idea of Windows 8.0.  I seriously considered switching to Mac O/S or Linux.  I thought maybe I should buy older laptops that have Vista (I don't hate Vista like most people do) or Windows 7 pre-installed.  So I have been using Windows 8.1 for several weeks now.  Honestly, I got used to it in the first 1-3 days, but then again I am good about customizing my computers.  The first thing you will probably want to do is have the computer boot straight to the Desktop.  To do this, right click on the Taskbar, and click on Properties.  Go to the Navigation Tab, under Start Screen settings, and you will probably want to put a check in those first two check-boxes.  Next, you might want to unpin all programs from the Start Screen.  You can still get to all those programs in the All Apps section, which can be accessed by the tiny arrow on the bottom of the Start Screen.  Take some time to organize your All Apps section.  If there is an App there you don't need, uninstall it.  You can also organize how your Apps are displayed by right clicking the App, and going to 'File Location' and then either delete the shortcut or move it around.  This really goes a long way in \"organizing\" your App screen.  Pin the most important programs that you use to your Taskbar, and then pin other programs that are important but not as important, to the Start Screen (where you unpinned everything earlier).  Finally, you can get on Google and find some tweaks.  There is a tweak for removing SkyDrive from your computer.  I don't like SkyDrive because I don't feel the need to have my personal files on the internet somewhere, where there is no guarantee to privacy and where there is no guarantee that the content won't be deleted.  They only give you like 5-8 GB of space anyway.  Why not just use a Portable Flash Drive disk?  There is another tweak that lets you get directly to the log-in screen where you type your password, instead of having to first click on some picture screen.  Little tweaks like this can go a long way to improving your user experience.  As for Navigating the Windows 8.1, it might take some of you longer to know where is what, but just remember that you can right click the Start Menu button to find most things instead of digging around in the Charm Window.  The hardest thing for me to get used to was powering down the computer. I am used to left clicking the Start Menu button, instead of right clicking it.  However, since I made it so that my Power Button powers off my computer instead of putting it to Sleep, I just use the Power Button now.For $600, I don't think you can go wrong with purchasing this laptop, unless you are one of those people who need the very best specs on everything.  If that's the case, you should invest $1,000 - $2,000 for your idea of a perfect gaming laptop, and don't bother criticizing this one.  I think this laptop is good for games though.  The only game I play is Second Life, but I'm getting around 50-60 FPS, which is good.  I'm very happy with that.  I am sorry if my Review sounded like rambling or was difficult to read, but I felt that writing a Review was better than not writing one at all.  If at any time this laptop dies on me, or I start having problems, I will be sure to update this Review.  So if you don't see an update from me, then know this - I still consider this a 5 Star purchase.  Thank you, and I hope you found something in this Review that was useful.  Peace.UPDATE: I just wanted to add three more things that I forgot to mention before.  One is that the power cord is an adequate length, pretty standard on what you would find on most laptops, but I do wish it was as long as the one on my previous HP Pavilion.  No biggie.  Nothing to take away points for.  Also, it's really cool that this Acer does not continuously charge your battery while the laptop is plugged in.  I discovered this by accident.  I don't know how low your battery needs to be before it starts charging, and it can probably be changed in settings, but at least it doesn't keep charging the battery when it is at 100%.  And finally, when I first received this laptop, I tried to install updates to the Intel and NVIDIA graphic drivers.  However, this was not possible.  You can only install updates for these two drivers from the Acer website.  This was strange to me, but since my Second Life game works perfectly, I don't have any complaints.  This is my fourth Acer laptop over the past 8 years, and I am happy with it.  (I pawned the first laptop because I needed Greyhound bus fare after getting stranded in Florida, I dropped the second laptop and shattered the screen, and I still have my 6 year old Acer Aspire One 8.9\" screen laptop).", "Date": "March 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Light Weight, Nice Screen", "Author": "C.

Just the right size (14\"), keyboard with a good feel, all the needed connections, lightweight and very good graphics for a reasonable price. Like having 8gb of RAM and an i5 Intel core. Would have preferred a solid state drive or a hybrid but likely will add later. Still getting used to Windows 8.1 but will likely keep although if get a new drive, may consider installing Windows 7 instead.However, the biggest problem has been getting a reliable internet connection. The wireless adapter that originally came with this laptop is an Qualcomm Atheros AR956x Wireless Network Adapter and it does not work well with Windows 8.1 at all. Constantly lost the WiFi signal and had to reconnect multiple times even though all other computers using my home WiFi router (ASUS RT65u) connected consistently and remained connected--including a new HP computer also using Windows 8.1. I tried upgrading driver and found that the one on Acer website is relatively old/the same that came with this laptop--even though I have found newer drivers elsewhere. I installed newer version of driver and this still did not correct the problem. After many hours of searching Google and seeing what others had said about this adapter and the problems that likely related to its older and perhaps cheaper components, I decided to change to an Intel adapter that others online had indicated fixed this problem. Purchased an Intel 6235 since has both WiFi and Bluetooth as does the Qualcomm but more reliable based on others experience. Intel also has a newer model, 7260 that also has Bluetooth that likely would work as well and may have better features since designed to work with the newer Haswell processors this computer has but I decided to go with the one others indicated worked for them. Took a relatively short time to replace and regretfully I may have invalidated my warranty but the bottom line is that it fit well and works great--much faster and more stable connection than before using the same 2.4Ghz connection even though it is a dual channel adapter and I can use the 5Ghz channel if I want. This was a significant flaw for me with this laptop that I hope Acer will address with this model. Adapter only cost $22 and the time spent replacing but now this is the computer that I was hoping to buy and it works great. Would now rate the laptop closer to a 5 with this flaw corrected.PS: I have worked with building computers before so this solution may not help others but it worked for me. Also it is not as easy to replace the hard drive and wireless adapters as is the case with my other Acer laptop and other laptops I have had previously since there are not places to directly access these components--you have to loosen the whole bottom base, lift the keyboard up and then relatively easy to replace.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "product arrived and screen flickered out of box", "Author": "Harry Rubin Jr.", "ReviewID": "RQNTV6FM7B6BY", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I went with this because it was inexpensive.

Yeoman", "ReviewID": "R1PQLVCFA3257M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I one-starred this to get people's attention. It's an okay laptop, but definitely not the best pick. There are computers here on Amazon that perform better in 400-500$ price range. Perform better at everything, including games. In fact, it is -26% less efficient than a laptop priced closer to $500 on this very site. Observe:[...]As you can see, the Radeon AMD HD 8650 is better than Geforce 820M. As an integrated graphics card that is usually partnered with A10 AMD Advanced Processing Units, how can Radeon HD 8650 be 26% better than a dedicated graphics card like the Geforce 820M?In the past, most computer experts would tell that even the worst dedicated graphics card is better than the best integrated one. That's been ambiguous for years and as of 2014 is pretty much false. Games like World of Warcraft and Skyrim have formed a new market of people who try to combine their gaming with other recreational and professional needs that laptops are particularly suited to serving. In the early-mid 2000s, a gaming laptop that was capable of anything ran from 1000 dollars for mediocrity to 2000-3000 for something comparable to a desktop. Too expensive for the young professionals who are also gamers, which usually meant they had to buy separate hardware (a console or a mid-level desktop) to get their gaming fix as a supplement to their laptop.To tap into this blooming market, companies like Radeon and GeForce have tried to manufacture new hardware that is capable of playing games at least at a console-level with a $400-600 range laptop.Since my mid-range $1,200 desktop that I built in 2008 runs equal or better than the new consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One), a laptop that plays games at a console-level would be considered terrible among hardened computer veterans.While GeForce (the premier graphics card manufacturer in the desktop market) approached this by trying to create a smaller more efficient dedicated graphics card, Radeon has pushed integrated processors and graphics cards into new technological territory, which as of the Radeon AMD HD 8650 is 26% superior to this Geforce 820M, as illustrated in the link I provided.As I said, the Radeon AMD HD 8650 and the HD just beneath it are usually partnered with an AMD A10-5750M processing unit. It it this combination of the graphics card with the processor that makes it \"Integrated\" as opposed to \"dedicated.\" The specs aren't always listed where integrated technology is concerned, so you have to poke around the Internet to make sure. There are plenty of A10 laptops (made by the biggest companies -- Asus, Acer, Toshiba, Dell, etc, etc) on this site that cost $600, and with Radeon AMD HD 8650 you know that it is a better buy than Geforce 820M.However, these laptops are usually available at better prices. For example, as of the date of this review Walmart is running an in-store special (advertised but not available on the Internet) for HP laptops using this technology for about $450, and it comes with Battlefield 4. Yep, that's 26% better performance for -$150 less.You can find slightly less lofty deals offered in places like Newegg and Staples. They're on Amazon too, but they tend to run out faster. Regardless, if you can confirm A10 and AMD Radeon HD 8650 for $600 or less, you've got yourself a better laptop than this one.The \"8650\" is key. As you can see, a slightly older AMD Radeon HD 8330 performs -50% less efficiently than a Geforce 820M.[...]", "Date": "March 24, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$599.99", "Features": "Intel Core i5-4200U 1.6 GHz (3 MB Cache)\n8 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n500 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n14-Inch Screen, NVIDIA GeForce GT 820M\nWindows 8.1, 4-hour battery life", "Name": "Acer E1-472G-6648 14-Inch Laptop (Misty Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/414p7eEUeTL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HC3498M"}}
