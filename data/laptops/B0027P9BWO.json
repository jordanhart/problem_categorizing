I have owned this laptop for about 4 months, and have not had any issues with it, nor did its previous owner. I'm going to call Sony today to see if I can have the fan replaced. Other than the issue with the fan, this laptop is AMAZING! It even has this little light on the front of the laptop that glows! :D That is a reason enough alone to buy this! lol", "Date": "June 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "cooling fan make loud noise???", "Author": "nicotonx", "ReviewID": "R1GNOFSPF75EZL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "yes it make loud noise but Sony will fix it for you, and its free, they extended its manufacturer warranty for 2 or 3 yrs i think.. just give them a call or visit there website, they will send someone to your laptop repair at your place, they already fix mine and it works OK now..", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Previous Sony Purchaser - Good Quality Machines", "Author": "diante", "ReviewID": "RXYZYA602G9CF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is the 2nd Sony Vaio brand laptop I've owned. Overall, I feel quite comfortable in my purchase. Many others have reported an issue with the fan on this laptop. Although I have to agree that the fan does make some noises, I don't experience unreasonable volume of the fan or other operational issues. Since it is a laptop, and requires ventilation, I also use an external cooling pad while the laptop is on for several hours at a time and have never experienced over-heating or unwarranted shut downs. Anyone who uses a laptop for extended periods of time should look into purchasing one (they're relatively cheap, ranging about $10 to $30) and allow the laptop to breathe, especially when it's placed on soft surfaces like furniture, pillows, or your lap. Also, Sony has agreed to repair the fan relating to this model. Information for this can be found here: [...]. As with many technological devices, they all have their issues. I feel Sony products are very well made and they're support service programs are quite on top of any issues that arise. Additionally, they're customer service is very helpful as well. I highly recommend.", "Date": "August 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great latptop", "Author": "K. Guan", "ReviewID": "R25VB6GW0618N8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got this laptop in pink and I've had it for a couple months now. I absolutely love how it looks and runs, but I agree with the other review that said the fan was a little loud. For the most part, it's pretty quiet, but when I run a CD or play a game, it gets really loud. Other than that, this laptop is great. If you're a college student like myself and looking for a reliable laptop, I'd say this would be a good choice. Hasn't failed me yet!", "Date": "October 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "3 issues make this a bad model", "Author": "Gonzalo Velasco C.", "ReviewID": "R2ZEE4CCA0KILB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My wife bough one of this in 2009. As every other reviewer had pointed out, there was a problem with the fan (issue #1) noisy and defective. Also, (issue #2) the LCD started to blink in the bottom, first just a line, then a 1.5 cm wide band. We were lucky that it was another defective part in all the series, so Sony took the laptop for a month and a half and returned it with 2 new parts (LCD and cooler). Last, but not least, issue #3: the software is really annoying. A welcome manager gives a \"not working\" message, and the system says it's \"searching for solutions\" (never getting one), and Windows Vista is absolutely slow. The DualCore CPU means nothing.After we decided and reinstalled the whole system (with the factory restore utility) it remained slow and the welcome manager (now working) even when clicking on the \"don't open this automatically every time I turn my computer on\" option, keeps running during the start up!!?? and when you click on \"close\", it takes for ever to close down.Sony must have offered a free upgrade to Window 7 for this series, and include the Sony software and extra problems solutions in the upgrade, for sure.As long as the hardware is solid and not presenting new issues, formatting it and installing a Linux OS is the best deal for this laptop model. The machine runs cool, then!", "Date": "April 10, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0027P9BWO"}}
