I was looking for a powerful laptop, that can keep up with my demands. Also something sleek and sturdy. I wanted a macbook pro but of course they are expensive. Then I saw this laptop and I said hey! This is exactly what I need. I don't mind not having a disk drive i have a portable one.I love that the keyboard is illuminated and you have a option to turn it off, it also has a dedicated number pad, that was important to me. The Steel chassis feels amazing, nice crisp edges, its a beautiful machine.After setting this up I upgraded to Windows 8.1 Most of the apps on Windows are 3rd party, windows needs to acquire more apps.However if your looking for a great high quality premium machine to do work, social media, music, games, and just a all around general laptop the Inspiron 7000 Ultrabook is for you.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good computer, great for price", "Author": "Douglas Leppard", "ReviewID": "R1BEEO5FD9OQ6O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My Win 7 Dell crashed and I needed an upgrade.Very pleased by this one.Below I listed what I wanted in computer and if it had it or not the Y it had the option and the O it didn't.Must haves for computer I wanted:Y 500gb HD (has 750gb)Y 6-8 GB RAM and expandable (has 6gb expands to 16gb)Y Windows 8 (not excited but had to make jump)Y 2 USB (it has 4!!!!)Y HDMI portY Touch screen (if you have windows 8 don\u2019t get one unless has touch screen)Nice to have:Y Bluetooth 4.0Y Multimedia porto Easily removable battery exchange (no have to take the whole back of computer off)o Easily exchangeable HD (no have to take the whole back of computer off)o Easily add RAM (no have to take the whole back of computer off, but you can do it)o Solid State HD (bummer will add in future)o DVD nice to have but can go withoutY Back lit keyboard (this was what finally sold me on this computer)Bottom line have it for almost two weeks and like it.

This laptop has not disappointed me at all! I always get compliments on it when I am in the library. People ask me what kind of laptop it is. The keyboard is great and responsive. Another plus is that the keyboard is backlit. The trackpad is huge and comfortable. The design of this laptop is spectacular. Aluminum and thin. I have heard of problems with the wifi being slow, but my wifi is not slow at all. It is super fast. I even had a computer technologist test the laptop speed along with the wifi speed, and it passed with flying colors. The only complaint I have about this laptop is that it is a bit on the heavier side for such a thing laptop. However, that is not a deal breaker for such an affordable yet competitive laptop.", "Date": "May 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "I Love it", "Author": "Isaac winfield", "ReviewID": "R2NE23YQOTM94K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my Dell Inspiron from bst buy as well and I have had no issues with it!

Speakers are tin and the touch pad is choppy. Hard to give a review of the hardware. The machine was slow and took a long time to boot, but this is likely because it shipped with a faulty hard drive. The drive died completely in the third week out of the box. About half the data on the hard drive was completely lost. Dell is currently shipping me another HDD which they cheerfully requested I install myself. I would not buy this laptop again.
