I was so impressed with the features that came with it.  All I needed are included in this one magnificent light unit plus Windows 7 is the best OS so far.  You don't have to spend that much for a good laptop try this and you will never regret it... you'll even have extra cash for a wireless all-in-one printer.", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good laptop bad sound", "Author": "Richard L. Adams", "ReviewID": "R3V9MNX9AL4Z1Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop for my wife 3 weeks ago. In that time we have had a chance to try it out. I agree with most of the other reviews as far as most of the features of this unit. The only problem we have is in the speaker. It comes with only one speaker which you cannot hear. I called Acer service and was told by someone in India, that there is no cure for the problem. He said because there is only one speaker, there is low volume. It is a shame because the rest of the unit works so well. If you use headphones the sound is excellent,but if you use the external speaker be prepared to put your ear next to it to hear.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great laptop", "Author": "Aaron H.", "ReviewID": "R2DMVU60EXWH3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop about a month ago. Very fast and quiet operation. The screen is vibrant & very clear. Great price for this system.It acts and feels like a $900 piece.Acer does an awesome job,LOVE their products.I plugged my nastolgic Juster 660 HIFI 3-d speakers and viola,great instant surround.The 1 stereo speaker is small yet audible&stereo.I; do wish it had 2,however,just for convenience.DVD multi is great as is the webcam and it's options.Deleting some chub programs made it even quicker. I would recommend this to anyone-again top of the line for the money.", "Date": "November 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Lap top for the price", "Author": "lettergram", "ReviewID": "R2VK1A0LR19W9Q", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I would recommend this computer for anyone who wishes to own a computer with a number pad, low cost, and fairly good insides. The down side is the lack of a battery life. This is over come by the prepossessing power, and number pad in my opinion. I have no major issues to report, and I enjoy the computer very much, especially for the price.", "Date": "September 19, 2010"}, {"Title": "good deal laptop", "Author": "weedfan", "ReviewID": "RIDQKM0YWTFCA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "my first laptop...works well with internet(mainly wat i got it 4). the built in wifi is great 2(tried it at the library,mcdonalds, n arbys,free of course.works best wen inside of building, but does work outside too). it is a dual core, wouldnt get anything less. it would b 2 slow(cpubenchmark 4 research). jus luv the portability n great lookin laptop overall! love the price 2. jus wish i couldve gotten it cheaper like the other peeps that reviewed this laptop. 1 thing i didnt like nothing major of course, jus prefer vista over 7. overall great laptop, get u 1!

I saw it in the walmart ad and it was for 329$. Asked my hubby on how he think about it, and he said it sure is promising. It has windows 7 OS, multi-use CD/DVD, multi-in-1 card reader like SD card reader/slot etc, battery/slot, webcam, 3 gigabytes RAM DDR3 and 250 Gigabyte Hard drive and has wifi in it. Very nice 15.6 inch screen. Fast in uploading images and searches in the internet. Can open lots of windows which is cool for me since I only have a Dell Latitude before. Bright screen. The only downside is that it only has 2 usb slots. Hubby says it's a powerful little machine. I love it!", "Date": "August 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Owned mine for over three years", "Author": "Stephen J. Tofani", "ReviewID": "RJ1DT9QNHUC8T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My Acer 5734z-4836 worked fine for about two and a half years, then both keys that give you a period broke. I have to use an external keyboard to write an email address. The low volume single speaker has always been a minor issue. I had a Thinkpad and a Toshiba for over six years each that never gave me these issues.", "Date": "January 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great laptop for home/personal use", "Author": "Rough Customer", "ReviewID": "R2HNLT5QAYICUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We got this laptop for my wife but agreed to share the use, and it is a fine little laptop computer.  Wireless connection to web, has a built in CD/DVD drive, a port for SD chips, two USB ports, and a built in vid camera above the screen.  the keyboard is nice, easy to use and the screen is large enough, and tilts back so that you can use the laptop when it is sitting at a lower postion so your hands feel comfy on the keyboard.  We also bought a separate wireless mouse but the touchpad is easy to use and responsive, there is a handy button to turn the touchpad on or off.The battery seems to work fine and lasts about 3 1/2 hours and the AC connection cord works well and is long enough. Plenty of RAM and hard drive.  Can't think of a single thing to say bad about this computer, very pleased!edit: now it is Nov.3 and I am still extremely pleased with this great laptop...ease of use, battery life, screen size, color, brightness..the keyboard is great, the \"controls\" are easy to use and \"user friendly\" asb far as knowing what everything is even for a novice like myself.  I do suggest that buyers of this unit consider buying a cordless mouse (USB port type) and a carrying case for the computer that can hold the mouse and power cord, etc.  I rarely ammend my reviews but this laptop is a dandy and I do recommend it for everyone who wants to get a reasonably priced, high performance laptop with all the normal bells and whistles.", "Date": "September 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice laptop for the price.", "Author": "sirak", "ReviewID": "R3EHZTDOPZ7R65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been doing some comparisons with other models of the Acer Aspire laptops and this one is a better value than the Acer Aspire AS5251-1805 which costs $100 more.
