Lost internet connection frequently.  Made many efforts to fix it, changed channels on the router etc.  Would not stay on.  It seems others have had the same problem.  I really wanted to like it but it was terrible.  Returned it easily.  Seller Gizmo4life was great.  Amazon was great.  Bought a Lenovo Thinkpad and it is great.", "Date": "November 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "No WiFi connection", "Author": "Elena Sorokova", "ReviewID": "R11T3UP05NHD9E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had to return it as it would not connect to the wifi router. To be more precise, it would connect to it only when staying very close to it. If you were in another room from the router, it won't see it. That's so not appropriate for a modern laptop. As I can see, it's acommon issue of this model.", "Date": "March 2, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$547.70", "Features": "Intel Pentium 2020M\n4 GB DDR3\n750 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n14-Inch Screen\nWindows 7 Home Premium 64-bit", "Name": "Acer Aspire E1-431-4404 14-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51foCpAcZBL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00F0RCBXW"}}
