{"Reviews": [{"Title": "What did you do HP?", "Author": "SLMaven \"SLMaven\"", "ReviewID": "R1NS6JWC7UU17U", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have owned several HP laptops and have never been disappointed in an HP laptop, until this one.  Basically I have two complaints (1)  I have no idea what I am hitting that's causing this problem, but the oversized mousepad resizes EVERY screen in EVERY program I'm using if I graze it \"wrong\". In typing this review, my screen has resized three different times and I have no idea what I've done to make that happen.  I assume there's got to be a way to shut it off, but several quick internet searches haven't provided a solution.  Even the HP site does not provide an explanation as to how their mousepad works.  It offers suggestions on how to turn it off completely, but does not explain how to turn of the resizing mechanism.  (2)  This keyboard is the most uncomfortable keyboard I've ever used. There's too much extra plastic and the end of the keyboard to make room for the stupid oversized mousepad.  Consequently, when I find myself typing a lot the edge of the laptop (which is about five inches away from the bottom of the keyboard) drives into your forearms.  It makes typing so uncomfortable.  I don't know how HP has gotten in right so many times, but with this one, has gotten it so wrong.", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "Intel Core_i5_2450M|#Core i5-2450M 2.5 GHz\n4 GB SDRAM\n500 GB 7200 rpm Hard Drive   Solid-State Drive\n15.6-Inch Screen\nWindows 7 Professional , 6.75hours Battery Life", "Name": "HP 6560b A7J96UT#ABA 15.6-Inch Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Ekc72N7DL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00723QY08"}}
