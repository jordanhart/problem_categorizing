I was kinda a skeptic cause its Amazon page really didn't have much information on the Laptop or anything.. But it arrived all brand new and in mint condition.. I am happy with this laptop :)I must revise this review.... Dell do not make good laptops. The video card is going bad.. my DVD players freeze every few seconds.. the screen just goes black for no reason... dont waste your money.. spend a little extra and upgrade to a Apple or Sony.. its pays off in the long run", "Date": "October 30, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2GB DDR3-1333 RAM\nAMD SempronTM V160\n15.6\" HD TrueLife LED-backlit Display\n250GB 5,400RPM Hard Drive\nMicrosoft Windows 7 Home Premium (64-bit) 3D Black", "Name": "Dell Inspiron M5030 Laptop Computer 3D Black", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51nwDsRY1vL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004MN6UFA"}}
