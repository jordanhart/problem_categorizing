I use it to play games like Star Wars online and War Thunder. I can play these on high quality with no issues with lag and looks great. My only complaint with this laptop is the keyboard although it is pretty easy to get use to. The touch pad isn't really worth using but a USB mouse makes it worth it. I recommend completely updating this laptop and the NVIIDIA driver completely. Right now i am using the current beta driver and it works good with my games.

I was given the Driver Power State Failure error message although I had not downloaded and installed any driver update!The next day, the laptop started just fine and I thought that the episode from the day before was just a minor glitch and forgot about it.However, the same thing happened after I \u2013 this time knowingly - updated an outdated driver (I just followed a notification from the taskbar). This time the trouble was more serious: The laptop oscillated between the startup screen, a black screen, and eventually the blue screen with the Driver Power State Failure. This went on for at least half an hour. Eventually I forced the system to shut down. Repeated attempts to get back into the system failed.I called Lenovo\u2019s customer support hoping somebody would talk me through the process of starting this brand-new Windows 8 machine in Safe Mode so that I would be able to uninstall the driver. The lady, however, had no idea what I as talking about. Instead, she had me remove the power cord and the battery. As these actions did not change anything, she eventually diagnosed a defective hardware component.Left to my own devices, I called a more knowledgeable friend who did not know either how to start a Windows 8 machine in Safe Mode. Eventually I had no other choice than to do system recovery which - by default - erases everything. Two weeks of hard work are wasted!While I can handle tragedies like that with older computers, a system crash on a brand-new machine is unacceptable. (My 7 \u2013 year old HP laptop never crashed! And I do everything on my computers besides gaming!)Another bigger issue is the battery: A fully charged battery lasts just for one and a half hours, at the most.I give it two stars (and not just one) because I really liked the crisp display, the backlit keyboard, and the light-weight.I am going to return this laptop and order a different IdeaPad from Lenovo, hopefully with more luck!P.S. In the meantime, I\u2019ve read other reviews and found that others have remarked about driver issues.", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "good bang for the buck", "Author": "Scott A.

Beck", "ReviewID": "R2IOV0BHHVG1FY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this computer (from amazon) based on the specs. My previous laptop was a Lenovo Ideapad y550p. I had nothing but good experiences and decided to purchase another.  As soon as I received the computer I replaced the hard drive with a new one and installed windows 7 Pro 64 bit. I installed the windows 7 drivers from the Lenovo website and immediately encountered my first problems. All of the drivers seemed to install properly BUT, the device manager showed two unknown USB devices. The computer ran well (excepting a few nvidia blue screens while gaming). More troubling was the following. Even with the battery FULLY CHARGED , if the computer was shut down for more than a few hours, it WOULD NOT START until the charger was plugged in. I tried removing and re installing drivers but, the results were always the same. My next step was to switch back to the factory hard drive. I set the the bios back to the original settings and booted into windows 8.0. I downloaded and installed (from the microsoft store ) the 8.1 update. So far so good. Windows update then installed numerous other updates and things seemed to be progressing smoothly. I checked the device manager , and lo and behold, the two unknown usb devices had been found! I deduced that they are tied to the Lenovo power management software. I decided to give windows 8.1 a try despite the conflicting reviews. I began enjoying the laptop. The features all worked, performance and ergonomics were satisfying in my daily use. EXCEPT, and oh boy, do I mean EXCEPT, the same power problem existed. Nothing I tried could get the thing to start after many down hours EXCEPT plugging in the charger. This was very troubling as I consider myself somewhat of an advanced user-( have built several dozen desktop systems). Internet searches revealed many others with the exact same problem. None of these users seemed to have successfully resolved their power issue. Next step was Lenovo technical support. First, I must say that all of my wait times were reasonable, and the techs were very courteous and seemed knowledgeable. I spent a few hours going through settings with them and allowed remote access to my laptop. The net result was no change. OK now I give up and send it back to be repaired. No problem right!? I mean Lenovo says seven day turn around. Well they acknowledged receiving the computer on April 25. Today (May 6) I get a voice mail from Lenovos service center that I can expect the laptop to be shipped back June 13th (Friday the 13th ironically enough ) due to back ordered parts. I'm glad I missed the call because I don't believe that I would have remained very polite If I had actually spoken to the caller!!  To me this kind of delay for a BRAND NEW model computer Is not just unacceptable, It's UNFORGIVABLE. The things are being built every day so, what's this BS excuse about back ordered parts?So in summary let me just say, NO, NO, NO, NO....HELL NO!!!!", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Lenovo Laptop", "Author": "SO \"mentor4success\"", "ReviewID": "R2CYDI3NSPF2B9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love this computer more than I needed but the price was so good and this is a good brand..picked up another laptop for the my son in college not as expensive as this one but what a deal on both!", "Date": "December 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Old computer died...", "Author": "DEVILDOCMOM \"DEVILDOCMOM\"", "ReviewID": "R3SK15PSY4QY2Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted my tech guru (my son) to pick one out for me...he has this laptop and loves it so suggested this for me and I am enjoying mine.

The NVIDIA OpenGL driver lost connection with the display driver due to excceeding the Windows Time-Out limit and is unable to continue.  The application must close.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I basically bought this laptop so that I could play Second Life.  It's the only 'game' that I play.  $850 is cheap for a laptop with these specs.  I bought the Model #59387520 version that had Windows 8.0 instead of Windows 8.1 while it was on sale.  It would be extremely difficult to find a 17.3\" screen with a high resolution (1920 x 1080) for under $1,100.  There was an ASUS laptop that around $150-250 more (I can't remember, it's been two weeks since I did all my research), but I felt this Lenovo would be better.  I was really anxious to try out this laptop.  A NVIDIA GeForce GT 745M is supposed to be noticeably better than an entry-level NVIDIA GeForce GT 720M.  And this has an i7 processor with a fast clock speed (2.4 GHz).  I felt that this would be a laptop that I could have for many years and truly enjoy Second Life with.When I received my laptop, the first thing I had to do was install all the available Window upgrades.  This is necessary if you want to install the free Windows 8.1 update from the Windows Store.  After I installed the Windows 8.1 update, I updated all available drivers and software (Adobe Flash, Java, Intel Driver, NVIDIA driver, etc.).  I also removed all apps that I did not need, which was basically all of them.  Then I installed the viewer for Second Life and tried to play my game.  Compared to my last laptop that had a NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS, the textures rezzed noticeably faster.  That made me happy.  But then I would get one of those aforementioned error messages which would crash my game.  When the game crashed, it did not shut out right away.  It just hanged there with a 'Not Responding' message.  I had to manually click the close box at the top right.  Also, the error messages kept flooding the screen.  I'd close it and another one would open again.  If I did nothing, it would just open up one after another.  If I tried to close them, they would still keep opening.  The error messages would not go away.  Also, I could not start up the game again.  I thought that maybe the game was still running in the background, so I tried to manually close the game from the Task Manager and that did not work.  The only way to get rid of the error messages and start the game again was to restart the computer.I experienced this a billion times (yeah I'm exaggerating on the exact number, but I want you to get the full effect of my horrible experience) everyday for a week.  I tried every fix imaginable.  I made sure that the Second Life game was running on the NVIDIA GPU by adding it to the list of 3D Programs in the NVIDIA Control Panel.  I tried changing the Power management mode from Adaptive to Prefer maximum performance.  I tried changing the desktop screen resolution.  I tried reducing the game's graphic preference to the lowest possible settings.  I tried disabling TDR.  I tried setting TDR to different numbers - 8, 60, 120, and 1,000.  I tried playing around with other TDR registry keys.  I tried changing all the other game settings in the 3D Programs menu on the NVIDIA Control Panel.  I tried installing older versions of NVIDIA driver.  I even used CCleaner and Display Driver Installer to make sure that my NVIDIA driver installs were clean.It was the most horrible experience ever.  I have a six year old Acer Aspire ZG6, 8.9\" laptop, with Windows XP and an integrated Intel GMA 960 GPU that never crashed while playing Second Life.  Sure, it was slow, but I could play Second Life nonstop for as long as I wanted.  I had a HP Pavilion dv6875se laptop with Windows Vista and a NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS GPU that also never crashed.  And yet this freaking Lenovo made me crash while playing Second Life an infinite number of times per day and I was forced to restart the computer each time, whereas on my other computers the game program just closed and I could open it back up again right away.After I returned the laptop, I found the following link where other customers experienced the same problems:[...]I have no idea what is causing this.  Is it because of the way Lenovo built their laptops?  Is it because of TDR changes in Windows 8?  Is it because of the quality of NVIDIA chips today, or that particular GT 745M, or did I just get a faulty chip or laptop?  I don't know.UPDATE: Amazon issued me a full refund and also paid for shipping to mail it back to them.  I bought a different laptop, the Acer E1-472G-6648, and it has no problems whatsoever, so it didn't have anything to do with the Windows 8.x O/S platform.In summary, BUYER BEWARE!!!", "Date": "February 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent machine, two niggles", "Author": "E.

I might even say I like it!  if you've never seen a 17\" screen laptop before, make sure you see one in the flesh before you order one.... I didn't and received a beast I wasn't expecting!The first niggle I have is the keyboard.  It works really well with the central section of it, but the extremities don't function well and it doesn't always work.  I use the keyboard a lot for shortcuts and the CTRL key in the bottom left corner is the worst offender.  The zero on the keypad is also too small, but at least it has a keypadThe second niggle is the F4 button.  It will only ever be 'close window'.  I've researched this and it is a Lenovo programming 'feature'.  It's very annoying because I use F4 for 'repeat last command' in MS Office.The third niggle I've just remembered (!) is the battery life.  It's not great, but then it's not a mac :)The speakers sound great for the kind of music I listen to (Jason Mraz, Philip Phillips, unplugged acoustic stuff etc).  They wouldn't be suitable for anything heavier really, but if you're gaming, you'll have your headphones or surround setup anyway.  The control on the EQ and Dolby etc is very good for 'free' software though, including full graphic EQ, compression, as well as some preset EQ too.  Audio recording is interesting and it appears to come through very syllabic, like someone wacked up the high frequencies.  I've checked the EQ settings and it's not that, so it's a bit of a mystery, but not a niggle really :)Anyway, that's all.

Construction is of good quality as i would expect from Lenovo, and the 17\" screen is beautiful.

Looked better than the Xbox 360 version. The real problems started with Civ5. Upon launching Civ 5, you are given a choice of launching with, DirectX9, DirectX 10/11, or Touchscreen enabled for Win 8.1. I chose win 8.1. and the graphics were horrible. That is where I learned how the video cards work in tandem and it was running off of the Intel 4600HD chip. Switched it to use the Nvidia GT745M and when the game loads, it has the BSOD at the title screen. The game will work flawlessly in DX9 mode.Next up, Photoshop CS6. basic functions work, but any 3D functions or tools like the Oil Painting filter will crash the nvidia drivers and sometimes give the system the BSOD.Downloaded a benchmark program called  Heaven DX11. Laptop will run flawlessly in DX9 and OpenGL, but DX11 will crash the drivers.I've tried 3 different sets of Nvidia drivers, even did a system restore. and get the same results. There seems to be a real problems with this and similar model Lenovo laptops, usually with the Nvidia GT745M chip and DX11 as other people seem to have similar issues, as evidence by these links to Lenovo and Nvidia forums.[...][...]There doesn't seem to be a solution to these problems, and I am thinking i may have to return this laptop before i get stuck with a lemon.UPDATE 2/23/2014The new Nvidia drivers, 334.89 seems to take major steps towards fixing my issues.
