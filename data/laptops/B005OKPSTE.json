After uninstalling all the bloatware, downloading the latest bios and drivers from both Samsung and AMD this laptop posts the following WEI...Processor: 6.9 (Just shy of a typical quad-core desktop cpu)RAM: 6.9 (probably due to latency and cpu speed)2D Graphics: 5.9 (far above most on-board graphics)3D Graphics: 6.5 (amazing since it costs $100 or more for a GPU equal to this rating)Hard Drive: 5.9 (standard for any 7200 RPM drive)With all this said, I had to install more RAM and add an SSD on my other laptop to meet this level of performance.  So, I'm very impressed to say the least.Note: To truly see performance gains with this laptop be certain to 1)uninstall all bloatware, 2) update the BIOS and all drivers from samsung.com, 3) use the grpahics card auto-detect from AMD.com and install the latest Catalyst driver, and finally 4) clean the registry.  The laptop will run 20-30% faster than out of the box if you do.", "Date": "March 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "powerful... even for games", "Author": "J. Brookes \"Jason B\"", "ReviewID": "R1SMSK420ARHEJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I chose this laptop because it has the AMD A-series A8 chip... This is a powerful integrated graphics processor for a mid/low-end laptop and I'm surprised just how great a deal this machine is. The game performance is impressive - according to a few reports online (youtube videos and PC harwdare test sites) compared to Intel i3 with integrated graphics it's double in terms of games performance) and it's very fast in Sketchup too. I almost went for the newer model suggested... but that only had an A6 chip... if you need a little extra performance buy this computer, you won't regret it. Speakers are average (ie weak) but not a deal breaker for me. Nice a light, LOVE the fast start feature - that's awesome.

He dropped is last laptop to many times.  He can play SWTOR, Skyrim, ME3 and a few other newer games with no problem (and do school work).  It does get hot when playing some games but I have him use one of those fans that plug into the usb port just to be safe.

It has nice large buttons, which makea loud but not distracting click when you push them.Display/OutputsThe screen doesn't show glare even in direct light which is great.It has an HDMI Out port for HDTV display capability and a VGA port for those who would want to setup a second monitor or TV with VGA (which I have used and it works flawlessly)InputsIt has 3 USB 2.0 ports these are good for using mice, cables, or nearly anything with a USB output.A Headphone-In and Microphone-In which is perfect for Skype or listening to pretty much anything on the laptop.Built-in WebcamThere is a built-in webcam, I think it puts out good quality for a built-in camera. But usually I need to turn on the low light compensation because my house has bad lighting at times.Built-in MicrophoneI like that it has a built-in microphone as well. Although I don't really use it as I have a microphone already. It is still good to have that option if some gets messed up.DVD DriveNow onto the disc drive. Yes, the laptop has a DVD burner which I am very happy about, as many computers (especially newer models) are losing the disc drive completely.Operating SystemThe laptop had Windows 7 Home Premium out of the box. Which is great. After about 5 or so months of using Windows 7 I upgraded to Windows 8 and I have not had any real major problems. Other than program compatibility issues and some pre-installed programs randomly deleting from my computer I am not having any problems with the laptop whatsoever.Battery LifeThe battery isn't usually what I use for power but on high performance I was able to get at least 4 hours out of the battery.I haven't tried any other power settings. As I likely run off of the AC Adapter.AC AdapterThe AC adapter which comes with the laptop is perfect, unlike my Toshiba which went through maybe 3 Ac adapters within the 4 years I used it. The plug is great and it isn't separated from it's housing when you plug it in. It stays where it should.I am hoping this will help some looking for a good review.", "Date": "April 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Best PC i have ever owned", "Author": "Price", "ReviewID": "R10UH415QAXW5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is only ONE minor detail i can complain about is the touchpad, it kinda comes up on one corner and sometimes interferes with usage, sometimes. Which ALL laptops have crappy touchpads, this has to be one of the better ones(although i use a mouse most of the time for games). as for the way it runs, it does everything i need it to, watch movies, listen to music, play all the pc games i download. it runs really well. even most tower pcs ive had crap out on me when playing certain games. With this i am able to run games at their near highest settings with no lag, Near highest settings because i turn off shadows in games, not really needed IMO. the speakers get pretty loud for a laptop, i hardly ever have it at full volume. I have had it for just about a year so far and it just is amazing :D", "Date": "June 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Temporary Review - General PC User", "Author": "Buyer \"Buyer\"", "ReviewID": "R3TKHSOU7HKULR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is my first day with the laptop. I am just a general user (music, video, MS Office, web browsing), so this is just for the feel/ease of use: - Track pad is nice. Good position and just sensitive enough. It does the Mac scrolling thing (2 fingers). - Feel of keyboard is great for me. I saw some complaints below, but it all makes sense; keys are a good size, it's not squished. I like that there aren't any touch buttons. Those things suck (had some on my HP Pavilion and they rarely worked right). - It never specifies, but the entire computer is matte (including screen) and black - Really fast start up and resume, with that Samsung sleep to wake thing. Seems to work well. - Samsung usually loads its products with tons of crap (I have the Tab too), but didn't do much of that with this laptop. - Comes with an OS recovery CD - Don't know about battery life yet, but other posts have good options for maximizing it. - It does get a little hot, specifically on the left side (right by where you plug in the power adapter). Kinda strange, but maybe it's b/c I'm installing/uninstalling a bunch of stuff right now. It might be that my entire Dropbox has been syncing for a while. - Isn't heavy, definitely not an Ultrabook/Air but good option if you want a 15\" screen. Feels compact. - Charging it now, and it's going up pretty fast. - Speakers are nice, nothing fabulous. Sounds comes from a long bar extending across the entire laptop. Doesn't get that loud, but what do you expect...I'll change this review to a 5 if I love it after a few weeks, or knock it down if anything bad happens. Overall, I'd say for under $600 this is a great deal. I can see this thing lasting me a while (I don't game though).

Olson", "ReviewID": "R1LFBL0NWO3WDL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the new Samsung Laptop for two weeks and it is marvelous. Windows 7 is slightly different than Vista so I had to adjust my approach a bit to get my programs & data loaded, but all that went fairly smoothly. No problem with it locating my wireless network; however, I did have to call HP to get the Samsung to recognize my HP printer (had the same problem with my old laptop so it must be an HP thing). Yes, the Samsung start is fast; beautiful color screen; can have several programs open & easily switch among them. My previous laptop was a 17\", but I actually like this 15.6\" much better. The screen size is plenty big enough for Netflix movies; the laptop is so much lighter & easier to cart around. Someone  mentioned that the zero on the numeric keypad is inconveniently placed directly to the right of the right arrow key. As a bookkeeper, I agree. I must be very careful.  The only other thing is that I constantly mis-type because the keys seem to need a firmer touch that I'm used to.
