{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent ultraportable laptop", "Author": "M. Russo", "ReviewID": "R2EXLF4RY11Z2N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I actually bought mine on eBay and assembled it from various working parts (for around less than two hundred dollars total, mind you), and must admit that I'm really in love with this machine.To begin with, I previously owned a Thinkpad x120e; a slightly smaller machine with a Dual-Core AMD E-350 processor and integrated Radeon HD 6310 (I believe they're referred to as APU's by AMD). The Thinkpad x120e was a real trooper, handling all my basic tasks with finesse. I also used it for light gaming, and found that Oblivion, New Vegas, Fable, F.E.A.R, and a few other games ran decently when well optimized.It didn't run a lot of the games I really wanted to play, though. Such as Tomb Raider, Crusader Kings II, Europa Universalis IV, etc. And beyond that, the x120e's AMD CPU ran HOT! I'm talking about idling at 60 C and regularly reaching temperatures approaching 80 C under load. In comes the next generation x131e I assembled; and wha-la, not only is the machine nearly twice as powerful, but my max temps don't tend to exceed 65 C, and the machine idles at 48 C. On top of that, many of the games I mentioned above that couldn't run now run flawlessly (as well as Mirror's Edge, which I enjoy a lot). Like the Thinkpad x120e before it, it can run Photoshop CS6, Firefox with a dozen tabs open, and Microsoft Excel at a brisk pace. Unlike netbooks, it can also be loaded with 8 GB's of RAM.Admittedly these machines are presumably \"Chromebooks\". That's probably in a bid to use them as student machines and keep costs very low. It doesn't justify their surprisingly high cost. A 16 GB SSD is nothing; my machine didn't come with a hard drive at all, but I immediately put a 240 GB SSD and Windows 8 into it. It runs like a dream and cold boots in ~10 seconds. Be aware that standard 9.5mm hard drives or SSD's with the 9.5mm spacers don't seem to fit in this; it was built for 7.5mm hard drives.So, let me go ahead and list some pros and cons:PROS: - Full sized island keyboard. The buttons feel very responsive. - Strong processor. You might not think so for a Celeron, but its performance equals the slightly older Intel Core i3-2357M. I believe newer models of the x131e feature a Core i5-3317U that handily beats both. I can't wait to get my hands on one of those motherboards to replace this one. But until then, as someone who regularly indulges in light gaming, this is excellent for the small package.- The Trackpoint knob is recessed a little more and feels a little lighter. It feels easier and more accurate to manipulate than previous Thinkpads.- The footprint of the laptop is rectangular. The previous x120e technically had a smaller footprint, but the battery poked out the back about an inch. Thus the x131e's overall footprint is identical to the x120e's, but the battery is recessed, so there's nothing \"poking out\".- USB 3.0 ports!- mSATA capability. This allows you to plug in a second SSD hard drive into the Mini-PCIe slot and double your potential hard drive capacity. The x120e didn't have mSATA capability.- Legendary build quality. The laptop has a lot of cute features that really exemplify the care put into its design, such as the red LED's put into the Thinkpad logo. The case is made of thick ABS plastic and the screen has a rubberized coating along the perimeter. The underside panel that allows you to access the motherboard for upgrades is metal. Coupled with the 6-cell battery, this might make the laptop a little heavier, but it's clear that it would do just fine in a fall. Plus six hours of battery life never hurt.- SIM card slot, and the ability to plug in a 3G-4G Mini-PCIe receiver. The Thinkpad x120e and x131e both feature an extra set of cables that plug into the antennas integrated into the screen, presumably to allow both 3G and WiFi usage shared over the same antennas. It would be amazing to have internet access anywhere.CONS:- In general it does feel a bit heavy for an ultraportable laptop. This is mostly a consequence of the above-described build quality, but it is noticeable in my laptop bag after having normalized cheaper netbooks.- Being a laptop, airflow is needed to keep the densely packed electronics cool. This laptop has considerable air ports, but, they're on the bottom of the machine. This means that if you seat the laptop on a soft surface, such as a bed or couch, you'll notice the temperatures increase dramatically. I find that this is a weakness of most Thinkpads.- The new recessed battery design and the design of the screen hinges means that the back of the laptop has been rendered inaccessible to ports. As a result the VGA port and power input have been shifted to the left and right sides respectively. This isn't a huge deal, but it was really convenient to have the port on the back for power, because it meant you didn't get an annoying cable crossover whether the cable was feeding from the left or the right.- The hinges seem weaker. The x120e's hinges seemed to be made of machined block aluminum and were rock-solid. These hinges are strong too, but not nearly as strong in my opinion. I don't know how well they'd hold up in a fall, although they're admittedly cheap and easy to replace.- I hate mousepads. However, even though this one is very nice and textured, it's also raised a bit (the x120e had an issue where it was difficult to access the periphery because it was recessed, and collected dirt). However it was raised without a corresponding raise of the trackpoint buttons. So, using the trackpoint left and right click can result in mousepad bumps, and it doesn't feel as authoritative. This isn't a problem for me since I disabled the mousepad, but it may be a little disappointing for trackpad fans.- The BIOS retains the function for the Function - Control Key swap, but the function and control keys are sized differently on this keyboard and can't be swapped. Thus the function key remains in the bottom left corner, which takes some getting used to.CONCLUSION:All right, that's a lot of stuff and probably nobody will even read it at this rate. But with that said, even with the cons mentioned above, I think this is a really great little laptop. If you can find it on the cheap or are savvy and can assemble one from parts, I strongly suggest that you hunt around on eBay, because its pros outweigh its problems.", "Date": "June 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "Bought as a gift, owner loves it", "Author": "xenoterracide", "ReviewID": "RCFE0BZQCNFJ8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this as a gift for a girlfriend, she needed a computer she could use for accessing web pages and google docs at school. She's not computer savvy and likes this more than the macbook she can't take with her (it's a shared computer). I own a Carbon X1, and about the only thing I found surprising trying this out is that this is both smaller, but heavier than my Carbon X1, I would have expected it to be lighter, or at least the same weight (obviously I could have read the specs and know that, it's just my bad assumption), so I'm removing a star for it being on the heavier than I'd like side, but that's not a complaint for her.", "Date": "June 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great product - Thanks!", "Author": "Carrie Hawk", "ReviewID": "R1RC5DSQBC2SN9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My dog bit the box to get at the mail carrier - but the product was GREAT!!!!
