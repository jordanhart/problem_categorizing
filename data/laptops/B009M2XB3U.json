{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Gaming Powerhouse for a reasonable price.", "Author": "Bradley Proctor", "ReviewID": "R2SUKN1NJUJ2EQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I noticed some weak reviews for this product and am quite disgusted. I bought this unit from Best Buy and have so far been impressed. I typically am a desktop user, in fact, I normally custom build my own rigs. I was in the market for a laptop, and didn't want to frustrate myself with custom building one so I shopped around a lot. For the price, it will be difficult to beat this machine. The only laptops that will come close (Dell XPS, AlienWare, and MSI) would all likely cost and extra $500-$1000. Every game I have played so far (Portal 2, Skyrim, etc) have ran on ultra settings with extremely great frame rates. Now for the Pros and cons:Pros: Great heat displacement, it has two large exhaust ports on the backside of the machine. This keeps the heat off of the bottom and allows for \"lap-top\" computing. Processing speed is amazing. Cost is low, but shop around, I got it at Bust Buy for $200 cheaper (though the build is not exact to this model make your own decisions as to what you need). Back-lit key board is extremely neat. Large vibrant HD screen. Its not loaded down with a bunch of bloatware and demos. GTX 660M is a great GPU for most all (with the exception of the have to have the most expensive and overkill, melt your face GPU) users. Additional port for secondary HDD. Easy access for upgrades to HDD an memory. Ivy Bridge! This thing has blistering fast multi-app processing power!Cons (and the reason for 4 stars): The biggest drawback for me is the 1TB HDD, as it is slow (5400 RPM). For this reason alone Windows Experience Index rated it a 5.9. All other ratings were mid to upper 7's. Shame on you Asus. For $130 buy a 128GB SSD from Amazon and up your computing potential. Just use the 1TB as a slave. It is bulky, but to be expected as it is a gaming lappy. Good luck trying to find a case that fits it.Lastly the power brick is enormous and the battery is lucky to give you 1.5 hrs unplugged. Again, this is a gaming laptop so this is to be expected.Other thoughts: The pros highly out weigh the cons! For the price this Republic of Gamers laptop by Asus is a great investment.2 Year Update: I still use this laptop daily. Again it still runs almost all of my games on Ultra settings. Boot time is still about 9 seconds (Keeping in mind I did install a Solid State Drive). I use this laptop for audio editing as well. This is an important note as audio editing on my previous custom built PC and HP laptop was frustrating. Adding filters or even saving a file could take minutes. With this laptop, it is instantaneous. 2 years in and still the best computer purchase I have ever made!", "Date": "May 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent power, annoying audio bug.", "Author": "Greg Siegel", "ReviewID": "R11G1QA3D1S7MS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Everything you've read in the other reviews about its power is true. Portal 2, Skyrim, etc. all look beautiful on this laptop. The matte screen with full 1080p resolution is very nice and easy on the eye. The jet engine fans on the back of the laptop have allowed for hours of gaming without feeling like I could flip the laptop over and grill an egg.Now, some issues. One is that the space bar is not as responsive as I would like on a gaming keyboard. If I have my thumb too far over to one side, it will fail to register the press. This being the jump key in a lot of games, one can imagine the annoyance this has caused (I've run straight off of platforms like a dork).The major issue, however, is that the subwoofer will sometimes play when you have headphones in. For a while, every time I started a media source that had audio, I would have to pull out my headphones and reinsert. This is quite annoying when you are trying to play something in a crowded room, or when someone in your house is sleeping. I uninstalled the drivers and let windows install its own, but now it mutes the audio until I click mute then unmute again. I don't know what is going on with this audio chipset, but there appear to be some kinks to iron out.The audio issue is not a dealbreaker for me, as the laptop really is quite nice looking with excellent performance.I am hoping an update in the future will make my $1300 purchase perform as it should.", "Date": "August 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great machine for the money!", "Author": "technojunkie", "ReviewID": "R1KW78JOQCMYRC", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm not a super gaming computer geek, but i know computers well and am an avid console gamer. I like playing fighting games like SFIV and the like and I also love first person shooters, action games, etc. Well so far I am VERY impressed with this behemouth of a machine! Not that street fighter is the most graphically intensive game, but i was coming from runing on my macbook pro under bootcamp with windows 7. Night and day difference. I can crank up all the settings including 8x antialiasing and the frame rate is stunning. no lag whatsoever. full screen full resolution all the bells and whistles enabled. Just Cause 2 i couldn't get the same with everything maxed out, but you probably would need a higher end machine to do that. With everything maxed out i was getting like 20fps but when i turned off the GPU water effect and toned down a couple other things i was getting a solid 60fps on the in game benchmark tests. Batman arkham asylum and the newer arkham city look positively stunning and smooooooth. The picture is great on this machine and the sound is quite good especially with the subwoofer. The power supply practically needs it own carrying case! Seriously this is the biggest brick i've ever seen on a notebook. The keyboard is very nice as is the track pad. the buttons on the trackpad have quite a bit of travel and feel kind of soft, but not mushy. The track pad also supports two finger rotation and pinch to zoom and 2 finger scrolling and 3 finger aero conrol of the windows 7 windows ala macbook (although it's nowhere near as smooth as the mac, but i didn't get this machine for smooth window navigation). I LOVE the rubberized feel of the plastic of the case. I also love that the machine doesn't come with 100 pieces of \"bloatware\"the 750gb hard drivecomes partitioned with about 300 (drive c) for OS and other programs and then a drive D (presumably for your gaming data) is about 400gb. There is still an open expansion bay for another hard drive I believe. Now remember, this is kind of the \"bottom of the line\" G75 with the 2gb graphics card (the 660) and the processors on the higher end units run a bit faster. So far the machine stays quite cool and it not even as noisey as my macbook pro (and not nearly as hot, you could make toast on my macbook when i was runing games in bootcamp). I don't know a lot about gaming machines but i've read that you can't just look at the graphics card or the processor but you have to look at everything together including how well the machine can cool itself because that can affect how well the gpu runs. I'm sure there are faster notebooks out there, but for 1500 bucks I am beside myself. I use an xbox 360 wireless controller and it works flawlessly, just make sure you download the 64bit driver from microsoft. For steam users, install it to the larger partition (the D drive). There is plenty of room on the 400gb partition. Even if every game you use is 10gb (which they usually are not) That's a lot of games with no external drive and you still have the C partition to store files on, plus you can always get another drive installed. I'm giving it 4 stars just to be conservative, but so far the only thing that's a bit off-putting is it's sheer size. it's much deeper than my 17 inch macbook and won't even fit (width-wise) into the sleeve of my 17inch backpack although it barely fits the length. I had to order an alienware backpack that accomodates the larger machines with the 17.3 screens. I travel A LOT and it is going to be really fantastic to have a complete gaming library with me wherever I go! Unless you're an uber-geek I would highly recommend this unit. Im sure it will do me for several years, but then again, technology is such that you're constantly kicking yourself for not waiting for the next better, faster, quieter, cooler, more power efficient thing to come along.Oh, by the way, the unit is lighter than it appears. Still heavy, but it is a desktop replacment, so that's just part and parcel...Hope this helps", "Date": "May 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic Gaming Power at a Midrange Price", "Author": "Shef", "ReviewID": "R2X5A1CF4H5V8J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought my new Asus Laptop June 2 at a Best Buy.  The unit I received has slightly different specs than the one listed here however they are minimal.  The laptop I purchased has only 8gigs of RAM instead of 16 but has a 1TB Hard Drive.  Besides that it is the same machine.  However, I found it at Best Buy for 1299 instead of 1499 (which is rare because I never expect Best Buy to have the best price).  I ended up paying 1566 after 5% tax but that included two year comprehensive warranty, Microsoft office, and two years of antivirus which I couldn't pass up.  I went straight home to try it out and so far I am impressed.  The unit looks beautiful with the matte screen and the fingerprint resistant finish.  The resolution is stunning and the backlit keyboard is solid. (though the keys feel a bit cheap I am not at all concerned)As my main concern was graphics, the first thing I did was download Skyrim from Steam.  Booting up the game for the first time showed me how this unit is worth every penny.  Many reviews talk generally about the graphics of their system but at the end of the day, I want to be able to say how it handles specific games.  That being said, Skyrim looks FANTASTIC.  I played it on my xbox360 in HD and the performance on this laptop makes the 360 version look like its from the 90's.  The lighting effects, graphical details, and resolution are all amazing and the smooth framerate blew me away.  I couldn't believe how well it was rendering the dense foliage and textures without missing a beat.  I am confident this baby will run anything I throw at it for years to come.  I also noticed that getting my music onto ITunes was fast as well.  On my old computers, uploading hundreds of files into the program often caused it to crash and took hours.  I got all my music up in a matter of minutes.One thing I did notice was the vibrations of the DVD drive when it is reading a disk.  I didn't worry at all but you always prefer quiet disk drives.  As I don't plan on using much media from DVD/CD's the concern is minimal.  Also the sound quality is rich and there seems to be a built in sub woofer but the volume doesn't quite reach loud enough for my tastes.  However, I have external speakers whenever I really need great volume so this is another non issue for me.  I have yet to find any real cons to this system yet although I have only had it for a day.The computer runs very quiet and looks like a professional/nerdy mix of materials and design.  I would also like to emphasize that I did lots of research before arriving at this laptop.  I found that it had minimal negative reviews with many good ones that matched my graphical expectations and price point.  While some people may complain about the hefty size of the computer or the large AC adapter brick that accompanies the unit, you must remember that this is a desktop replacement gaming laptop and it serves its role admirably.  I would strongly recommend this laptop to anyone looking for a gaming powerhouse laptop without breaking the bank and is willing to sacrifice portability for power.**Update**I bought a SanDisk 120 GIG SSD on Amazon and went to Best Buy to let them install it.  The warrenty I purchased covered the instalation and migration of the OS to the SSD.  It took them three days to complete the job and I now have both hard drives in the machine: the 120SSD and the 1Terabyte 5400RMP-HHD.  I have to say it was a great idea to upgrade.  My computer boots in 20 seconds (as oppsed to about 60 before)I was able to load saves in Skyrim in five second as opposed to 10-15 seconds.  This is as fast as I have ever seen a computer run.  I store all OS related files and programs as well as games on the SSD and my music, docs, and movies on the HHD.  The people at best buy did remove the recovery partition, but I can take it back if something happens.  I highly reccomend doing a similar upgrade if you have an in store warrenty or if you know how to do it yourself.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very nice powerful laptop with minor problems", "Author": "Sergey Antopolskiy", "ReviewID": "R2ZBOIBDLE8MS1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this laptop from Amazon around a month ago. I planned to use it for analyzing my data in Matlab and gaming. Mainly as desktop replacement, but also for travels to conferences, collaborators, etc. I think I made the right choice, since up to now I am completely satisfied. Computer performance is extraordinary good, design is neat, keyboard is good.I experienced one unpleasant problem which I managed to solve. The computer every now and then (couple of times in an hour or so) makes a latency spike for about 1-2 sec, during which nothing works and if you happen to listen to music or watching a movie, it will make horrible screeching sound. I am pretty tolerant person, so I didn't care until this thing started to interfere with my League of Legend tournaments (2 sec lag in a wrong place equals to loosing a 45 min game). So I went online, and found this thread on the Republic of Gamers forum rog.asus.com/forum/showthread.php?14960-G75VW-random-audio-and-graphics-spike). It turns out that many people have this problem with G75. Someone on the forum reported that uninstalling McAfee antivirus worked for him. I tried and it worked for me too. I do not experience this problem anymore. But I have to warn you that some other people report that this solution doesn't work for them.There are other minor problems, which I want to report.1. When the computer came, the bottom rim of the screen was detached, that is, disconnected from the screen itself. I fixed it by gently pushing onto the rim, so the holders on the other side went inside the corpus where they belong.2. Sometimes, if I use a headset, the computer doesn't give audio output into earphones, but instead gives it to the speakers (sometimes both speakers and earphones at the same time). So I have to unplug headset and plug it in again. (RESOLVED)3. Touchpad works strange in double touch mode. It is supposed to implement mac-like scrolling with double touch, but it works only half of the time. I found that it works better if you touch it sort of ridiculously gentle, like almost to pressure at all. Well, anyway I don't use this function. (RESOLVED)Update-02/12/2013: Still very satisfied. Had no further problems, computer works very stable. Problem with headset has been solved in latest audio card patch. Touchpad scrolling works fine too, turns out I wasn't using it right: for bottom-up scrolling you are supposed to make double touch in vertical axis, but I was making in horizontal.Update-11/09/2013: Having the laptop over a year now. Never let me down (well, it crashed once when I connected it to a projector, but that was it). I started to notice though that speakers on some other laptops are far better than on this one, so if you're sensitive to this, you might consider something else. Same goes for the screen. If you plan to do some serious photo-editing, make sure you're comfortable with the screen. The screen is great actually, because it is matte. Not only it doesn't reflect much light, but also eyes do not tire so easy. But it does look a little more bleak compared to some glossy screens (e.g. the one of new macbooks).One of the great things about this laptop I've really appreciated when I got sick and lied in bed is that you can actually work with it on your laps or in bed. Unlike most laptops which get air from below, G75 draws air from the top and pushes it behind. It will never overheat and you can meliorate your fever suffering with some Skyrim play-through :) (good god this game is long.)", "Date": "July 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice machine", "Author": "Robert M. Matthews", "ReviewID": "R2PYSSYE8JVPWI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have only had this notebook for two days now and would like to focus this review on my first impressions and experiences with it.  I received it two days ago when I got home from work.  After charging the battery for a couple of hours I turned it on and it went through a process of setting up some things in Windows and I had to enter my wireless key.  Everything went smoothly.  I was surprised to see only five icons on the desktop-- Recycle Bin, Asus Vibe Fun Center (whatever that is)Asus Web Storage, eManual, and McAfee!  I suspected that there might be some anti-virus software lurking and sure enough, a one month free trial from McAfee which I had five days to activate!  Amazon didn't say anything about that.So, knowing I would need to have an anti-virus program, I went to the McAfee website to activate the temporary account and ended up buying a year's subscription online for around $70 and downloaded it.  Before it could download, McAfee had to first uninstall the free one month anti-virus trial program.  I guess if I opted out it would have been up to me to figure out how to uninstall it entirely before installing Norton.  Anyway, I bought it from them and everything seems OK.Now the first order of business was to create the four Recovery DVD's.  Using some HP DVD+R 4.7GB, the first DVD took 45 minutes to burn, the second and third 10 minutes each, and the fourth 7 minutes for a total of 72 minutes.  Had I checked the box \"Fully verify data when burning disc\" it would have been longer.After waiting through many Windows updates, the machine seemed to be functioning very well.  I downloaded Google Chrome and installed Adobe Lightroom 4 without any problems at all.  I noticed a previous reviewer had a blue screen due to playing a you tube music video, so I tried one from Little Richard and it worked perfectly.  If Richard can't give you a BSOD, nobody can!I was hesitant to get a 17 inch screen, thinking that it would be too small for gaming, but when you sit in front of this notebook it looks a lot larger than 17 inches!  I love it, and the matte finish is excellent, as is the illuminated keyboard (you can vary the intensity).  I feel very good about buying this notebook.  I originally ordered the model with the gtx 670 video card, but I had it backordered for ten days and nothing was happening, so I got this one.  I don't think it will matter much to me because I am more interested in photography than gaming, except when it comes to Thief.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "The machine runs like a dream", "Author": "Michael W.

I have not been much of a gamer so I cannot speak to that but I bought this laptop because of the reviews I have read over the years how the game machines are pretty close on par with workstations.I bought this to really focus on Corel Painter 12 to work on files that are pretty large and with higher resolution so that I might be able to produce limited edition gicles directly from the digital painting.  I am hoping this will be a step in the right direction.I am still in the process of installing programs onto the machine...but even this process seems to be lightning fast to my other computers.I read all the reviews so far so I wanted to add that my machine seems to work perfectly...no problems with the space bar and the feedback and comfort of the keyboard is great.I will add to this comment over the next few days as I begin to work in the programs I have.

Brailsford", "ReviewID": "R1UGHOAUCHZCGB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After doing a bit of research, reading the reviews, and comparing prices of other mid range and higher end systems out there, I decided on the ASUS G75VW-AH71 - the one with Windows 8, less Ram than the AS71, and a graphics card that was going to give me around 5 fps more on average - the NVidia GTX 670M.  The AS71 model is listed as coming with the 660M, and although there were some negative things about the 670M, the positives tipped the scales and I decided to fork out the extra $170.I got the laptop in the mail yesterday, and it is awesome.... except it has the 660M Video card.  I would not have paid an extra $170 for Windows 8 and half the RAM.  Especially when there are specials out there that let up upgrade 7 to 8 for as little as 15 bucks, and 8 gigs of ram is about $40.I've searched around, and can't find anything that says the 670M would show as a 660M in both device manager and through NVidia's online detection tool.  Everything out there says there are some issues with an updated driver, but those posts talk about the card being correctly detected as a 670M and not a 660M.I have contacted Amazon and we are working on an exchange.  I will update this review once I receive the exchange based on the video card and the exchange experience.  This is my first negative experience with a product ordered from Amazon - and although I'm not a frequent reviewer, I am a frequent buyer.Fingers Crossed I can update this to 5 stars!*********Update 11/16/12I received the replacement today via UPS.  Definitely a very fast turnaround time; however upon opening the machine, it's still got the 660M NVidia card.HOWEVERI called Amazon right away, and as with the previous call got a super helpful person on the line.  They offered another exchange and I brought up the possibility that the specs were not matching on the product page instead of that the laptop itself was wrong.  I will admit I was on hold off and on for a while, but the rep checked in with me regularly, and communicated really well about what was being done while he was away.  The customer service is definitely well beyond any company I have worked with as a consumer in the last 5 - 10 years.As I write this update, the product has the \"temporarily unavailable\" disclaimer due to the difference in product specs.  I was offered a full refund, but as I really DO like the laptop, and my only real concern was the price difference for a video card with less video RAM, and the additional $$ I spent to upgrade to 16 GB of system RAM, we worked out a deal that wasn't just to my satisfaction, it was well beyond my expectations.Thank You Amazon for making me feel like a valued customer without having to work for it.", "Date": "November 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Machine for the Price", "Author": "isbelldl", "ReviewID": "R1B8WUW7S28WB5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First, a clarification. The specs listed are contradictory.

The screen is beautiful. The trackpad works well. I've been able to run Minecraft at max settings with 60+fps, & Mechwarrior Online at max settings around 25-30fps. The fans are quiet & effective. The case seems well built, & a large panel on the bottom provides easy access to the hard drive bays, 2 open RAM slots, & one of the fans. The other fan is accessible from a separate panel.The computer does have some minor issues, but nothing I can't deal with. They keyboard is mediocre. Not bad to type on, but not as good as the Vaio laptop I've used. Locating volume controls on fn+f10 through fn+f12 was a poor design choice. I would rather see them on fn+f2 through fn+f4, swapping places with keyboard brightness settings & the wireless switch. They're my most used fn command, & yet the hardest to reach. The home/pgup/pgdn/end layout is also a bit unintuitive to me. The one upside is a bump on the w key to help find wasd when gaming. The speakers are decent, but not great. The subwoofer receives a full range signal, & with the factory drivers may play even with headphones plugged in. Updated drivers will fix the headphones issue. Check the ROG forums for a link.In summary:Pros:- Good performance for price- Great screen- Stays cool & quiet- Seems well built- Easily accessible/upgradable RAM slots (2 of 4) & HDD bays- Raised bump on w key for wasd when gaming.- Decent trackpadCons:- Mediocre keyboard, not the greatest layout.- Mediocre speakers, must update drivers to work properly with headphonesI would buy this laptop again.Edit: Trackpad is much more responsive after turning off the delay in the PC Settings menu.

Charlemagne \"123\"", "ReviewID": "R3T5TX0ECY91OB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The ASUS G75VW is a great laptop - even if you aren't into gaming. The CPU and video card aren't the highest spec available, but they're 95% of the way there, allowing you to have a cooler running laptop and lower cost, while getting most of the performance the high end hardware have.The 1080p display is really good, my laptop had no dead pixels, the refresh rate is excellent, as is color reproduction. There have been several bad reviews about this laptop's display, but they appear to all come from the G75VW-BBK5 (a BestBuy specific model) which appears to use a different display than the other G75VW's. So buyer be warned when cross shopping.The 750 gig hard drive has multiple partitions, some users complain about it, or about the recovery partition being unusable. If you really must reclaim the space used by the recovery partition, please be aware that Microsoft's disk tool won't let you touch the recovery partition. There are multiple freeware software available that will let you delete it. This isn't ASUS's fault, it's just how MS deals with recovery disks.The keyboard has a chicklet style design. I was worried it would make it difficult to type on, but the keys are actually very nice to type with. The backlight on the keyboard is adjustable too.Some people have complained about the audio on the laptop - I haven't had any issue with it. The sound is quite nice, and as good as you can expect from small speakers in a small housing. Obviously you won't get full 7.1 surround sound that your $3000 home stereo would produce. The audio is clear, sharp, and even has decent base. I did note some audio break up at higher volume levels, but it's far from being an issue as the system is loud even at lower volume levels.The wireless card seems to work well. I have run it on mixed network as well as wireless-N only networks. Speeds have been good, no disconnects.The laptop has two big fan vents on the bottom. They not only push air out the back, but they're directly connected to the cpu/graphics card and cool them at the same time. They are big enough that they make virtually no sound when running (smaller fans will spin faster and make more buzzing sounds).The laptop has two hard drive bays. Only one is used for the AS71. They are accessible from the bottom of the laptop by removing a single screw. The laptop has full SATA3 specs. For $100, I purchased a 128gig SSD and placed it in the first slot. I then reinstalled Windows7. Boot up time is ten seconds for windows 7, and seven seconds for Fedora 17. The laptop is faster than my (first generation) i7 desktop which also has a SSD and 16 gig ram.With the above configuration, Windows Experience lists the laptop with:Processor: 7.6Graphics: 7.3Memory: 7.9Hard Disk: 7.9Max score is 7.9.The AS71 comes with all 4 ram slots used up - 4 gigs each, for a total of 16 gigs. This is supposedly the max amount of ram the laptop can use, but I've read on forums that users have been able to install 8 gig sticks of ram without issue (for a total of 32 gig).There are a few potential down sides to this laptop:1. The laptop is about 10 lbs, and the ac adapter is 2 lbs. While the display is 17.3\", the laptop itself is even larger than that. All of this makes the laptop bulky and difficult to transport. I don't think this is an issue for most as this is really a desktop replacement that can be portable when needed. I would not recommend it to someone who had to constantly move about.2. Battery life is just over 2 hours. Again, as with point #1, this is a desktop replacement, and shouldn't be directly compared with ultra mobile laptops that can get 10+ hours of life. The ultra mobile laptops wouldn't compare in performance to this either.3. The laptop lid is soft. I can press down on the lid and it gives. When opening the lid from the center, the top bezel will snap out of place (It doesn't look any different from normal) but I know it was out of place when I later shut the lid and a snapping sound is heard. The solution to this is to open the lid by grasping each top corner with your hands (instead of the center). The laptop is heavy enough that you can open the lid this way and it avoids bending the screen bezel.All in all, the only thing I would like to see is a firmer plastic (or metal) housing on the laptop. It's not to say that the laptop is flimsy or built poorly (It's designed quite nicely), I just don't like hardware that flexes, especially when it's by the display.There are a lot of pros, but you'll buy a laptop that best fits what you want to do with it. The only thing I'll mention as a pro is that most laptops that have a 3rd gen i7 laptop, 16 gigs of ram, 1080p display at 17.3\", will cost you upwards of $2000. My first choice wasn't ASUS (frankly at this price point, I was worried there would be extreme cost cutting that would result with a cheap laptop that wouldn't last), but after a lot of research, it was a toss up between this and the Samsung. Samsung's came with half the ram and so I opted to try the ASUS instead.

First is that the letter Q on the keyboard has to be pressed really hard to get it register, and the other is a refresh issue with the LCD panel which has no good fix, but rather a band-aid that was discovered by other users.If you have this issue you can find a solution atrog(dot)asus(dot)com/forum/showthread.php?5536-Asus-G74-screen-flicker-(dark-backgrounds-and-low-brightness)&p;=108570&viewfull;=1#post108570The Q key issue gets very annoying after a while, but to get it fixed the RMA process will take at least two weeks (as conveyed to me by ASUS reps) and I find myself debating if it's worth it. All kinds of problems can happen during shipment and improper care by ASUS technical staff, plus I won't have my main workstation for at least two weeks.If this wasn't otherwise a great laptop I would have given 1 star.", "Date": "November 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Powerhouse gaming machine for a great price.", "Author": "JOHN SPANGLER \"Johnny Spang\"", "ReviewID": "R15FHACOP2U0SE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My friend from work watch me unpack it, and his first response was \"oh my lord, look at that thing! That is awesome!\"I used to be all about Console gaming, but all that changed when I broke down and decided to get this machine. I heard so much about Steam and PC gaming and finally decided to take the time to get PC for my gaming needs. I did plentiful research, and ASUS was always mentioned when getting a Gaming machine laptop. Without question, this is the most satisfying purchase I've made in my life for any gaming experience. Including all consoles. This is a beast of a machine, has the best graphics I've ever seen in my life for any game I put to it. While I'm no expert on specs and tech stuff, I do know that the graphics on this machine blow away anything I've seen on the PS3 and XBOX 360. I've Ran Skyrim, Sleeping Dogs, Amnesia, and have downloaded several games from Steam lately. Batman A.C. looks like a movie, the graphics are downright sickening how wonderful they are. I have most games running at the absolute highest graphic resolution. It's being pushed to the max, yet doesn't seem to be breaking a sweat. I connected my video via HDMI to a Sanyo 30 inch TV. Again, graphics are crystal clear, sharp, smooth and lively. I didn't know PC gaming could be so amazing. For a controller, I plugged an XBOX 360 controller to it and worked perfectly. (I had to download drivers from the Internet, but was very simple) 85% of the games out there now let you use a controller, and the 360 one is the one I'd say for you to get! As a standalone laptop, it works great. It's not something I recommend taking places, it's pretty heavy and can get hot in your lap especially if you're gaming. I recommend getting a laptop tray to keep on the floor on your lap to keep it from overheating. I've yet to have it overheat on me, and hasn't been hot to the touch yet. The speakers alone are worth a mention for the laptop itself. Easily the best sound I've heard coming out of a laptop. Headphones and speakers are still recommended though.If you're looking for a laptop to play games, you found the right one. This laptop will fit the bill.

I added the Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2x4GB)  DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop  Memory (CMSX8GX3M2A1600C9) to my order (the Windows 8 option I chose lacked RAM for some reason) and installed it before booting for the first time.As I've done with other reviews on products that have already had a large number of reviews, I'll give my impressions in a list form of pros and cons.Pros:- It's fast. I've not run any serious games and probably never will, but on a regular basis, I might have several large Excel files open, one or two Word files, a PDF or two, Outlook, Chrome with twenty or thirty windows open, ACDSee 6, iTunes, and maybe a card or other small game lurking in the background and this ASUS doesn't seem to know it's doing any work at all. I love it.- The screen is beautiful. Fully adjustable brightness from the keyboard and whole slew of display settings (thanks to NVIDIA software) make the display easy to adjust for any situation.- The keyboard is great. The product description calls it a \"tilt-up\" design. It's hard for me to pinpoint exactly what it is, but I find that this is perhaps the most comfortable notebook keyboard designs I've ever tried. The area where you rest your palms sits roughly a quarter inch higher than the level of the keyboard and the whole keyboard platform seems to slope gently upward. The back-lit adjustable brightness of the keyboard comes in very handy when watching TV with the wife in a darkened room while typing Amazon product reviews.- Four USB 3.0 ports as well as a Thunderbolt port offer a variety of high speed connectionsCons:- This notebook is huge. So huge in fact that it's difficult to find a case that will hold it. The power adapter is literally close to the size of a brick. I'm not gigging the star rating for this fact, but it's something that perspective buyers should be aware of. I bought the Targus Drifter II Backpack Designed for 17-Inch Laptop TSB239US (Black/Gray) and the computer won't quite fit in the intended padded and strapped pocket, but will comfortably fit in the slightly less protected main backpack compartment.- My computer has something rattling around inside it. I noticed it when my Targus backpack arrived a few days after my computer and I unplugged it and picked it up to see if I could fit it into my new case. There was a definite rattle inside the computer case that sounds to me like a screw rolling around. I removed the battery, RAM & fan covers and tilted the case around and could hear the object moving all the way from one side of the computer to another, but never did get it to shake out. I'm gigging the star rating one star for this. I'm sure that this isn't a common occurrence, and maybe it will never cause computer failure, but I can't help wondering if that little screw might not land on something and cause a short some day.All in all, this is a great computer for my purposes. If it weren't for the rattle, I'd give it 4.5 stars (if that were possible).

It looks and runs amazing with everything on SUPER DOOM mode, and the awesome speakers and subwoofer just complete the package!Stuff I didnt know and love until I recieved it:The whole thing is covered in matte, rubbery non slip stuff which means it wont budge even during the most intense gaming!!  Around the keys however its bullet aluminum, and it looks freakin awesome. Didn't remember reading the keys were backlight but they are, woot, and the sub is on the bottom of the laptop on the left. So in normal game position (fingers on or around w-a-s-d) the sub rumbles under my wrist and gives my game a whole new effect!I was concerned about the thickness and weight but it really doesn't seem to bad, I'm hoping it fits in the bag I ordered but we'll see.....The battery pack is also a BRICK! Its huge and heavy and can get kind of warm so be aware of where u set it.

Thinking nothing of it used it for some time and finally rebooted after updating GTX660M driver. The G75 is bricked @ this point,only the power light is on and the fans. Screen, gpu, hdd, sdd, usb, dvd - DEAD !!!Now, I live in Brooklyn so I hand delivered this Asus to Datavision in NYC on Nov. 11th, today is Nov. 27th and I sitting here writing this on a '06 Toshiba Satellite A135 :/ & my damn Asus is still in Datavision.The people there are telling me Asus DID NOT SEND THE MOTHERBOARD YET !!!! They tried to contact Asus headquarters in Cali. by E-mail - no response for two days !!! I'm trying to call them myself, but there's never anyone available.So now I'm here for 15 days without my G75 and the goddamn company is not responding, @ Datavision I don't even have to give them the repair # the guy just knows me by voice :(ASUS Support sucks just like many people said. I wish I could just get my PC back fast, exchange it, get my money back and go with MSi brand, since I tired of waiting for a High-End GPU option in Asus G, or even the damn G75VX release.ASUS WARRANTY REPAIR IS TRASH !!! ZERO COURTESY !The five stars remain since the G75VW is amazing when working, but people representing the company are good for nothing.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Asus G75VW-AS71: This is my first 17+\" laptop.I did own Asus K53SV-A1 which I loved, but I just shipped it today since I got this beast.In a glance the G75VW doesn't look as elegant and sexy as my K53SV. I'll go further and say it looks kinda boring with it's shades of gray, but that all changes when You start it up the first time.If You're buying a PC for it's looks then this isn't the one for You, but if You're a pro-gamer on some days and like to get in 1080p HD action and destruction then You've found a match!!!!Since last year when I got my previous Asus laptop I'm hooked on their products. Fair pricing with great value and reliability make this brand my first choice every time.This G75 is no different and comes packed with high-end hardware that will keep You in the game for the next year or two.Since it's a gaming PC I have to mention BF3.Battlefield 3 runs like a monster: 1080p + ambient occlusion + anti-alising + ultra detail (shadows on high) and I run @ 45 - 60 FPS.My kill ratio and points/min jumped like crazy since everything runs so much smoother. The GTX660M never gets hot like GT540M (85*C @ BF3) I had before and manages to squeeze out so much performance, 16GB SO-DIMM RAM loads all games @ lightning speeds and the i7 3610QM processor edits 1080p video like my i5 2410M did on 480p - super fast.This here is a Battlefield 3 Certified Gaming Laptop in my book :D I'm a Bf fan so I don't really know how other games will run, but with these specs You just can't go wrong!I'm a proud new owner of this Asus G75VW ROG for less then a week and realize that it's too early to give it a mark, but so far the ROG delivers everything that was promised to me.In some time I'll do an update on this product to let anyone interested know it works out.'Till then Peace!UPDATE:Well we just passed September and the G75 is running as strong as the first day I had it............Tried a couple of more games (Ultra detail) GTA4 + car mods + IC Enchancer 1080p 30-50fps :) the game looks amazing. Since I have the G75 I think I edited over 3TB of 1080p and HD+ video and uploaded to Youtube using my old Toshiba Satellite, the i7 had enough power reserve that it never gets hotter than 70*C working for straight 30min. of video conversion. Since last time I had a pleasure of using a MSi GT70ONE with GTX 670M 3GB, 12GB RAM & 3610QM i7 and gotta say even though the GTX 670M has more power and is definitely faster mine the temps this MSi reached were just sad. 80*C after 20min. of BF 3 1080p gameplay :/ GTX 660M should have more memory (I wish:D) since this GPU never, let me repeat this NEVER gets hotter than 64-65*C - You can keep it on Your lap making this rig the only gaming laptop I've seen that is capable of this :DIn general: I read many bad reviews mentioning the screen or GPU not working, myself never had even the slightest problem with this G75VW, just like the K53SV it's a great machine that makes me happy every time I start it up and never wastes my time with blue screens and freezes (come to think f it I never seen a blue screen since my K53 or had a AsusTek product fail - that speaks to me about their quality, since I had PCs that showed me nothing but errors in the past).Every product has defects and writing reviews about those defects doesn't make sense to me, one should only review something You were actually able to use, that said I do understand the frustration coming from a broken computer as well.Anyway, in my opinion this is the best PC I ever had I can't really think of any major negative I should mention.One thing I would like to see happen would be AsusTek releasing a GTX 680M 4GB powered G75VW - it's long over due .Peace.", "Date": "July 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent", "Author": "Peter Harvey", "ReviewID": "R3TZW55FUYTKI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Amazing game graphics abilities.

That i5 impressed me, so I stayed with the brand when I wanted an upgrade. Looking at the specs I could see the drive the G75VW ships with is slow at 5400rpm, so when I bought the laptop I also picked up a 120GB SATA3 SSD. Installing the SSD was easy and required only a small Philips head screwdriver for all screws along with a wide flathead screwdriver to help pop open the bottom cover. Keep in mind if you do the upgrade instead of an authorized repair center the ASUS warranty may be canceled. Instead of BIOS the ASUS machine uses the newer UEFI, which is actually simpler than BIOS. Read about UEFI on Wikipedia.org. The laptop has two bays along with a frame over each bay.  The drive bays have slightly different placements for the screws that hold the frame on top of the drive- this is not a serious problem, just know you may have to adjust the frame or flip the frame around if you move the original drive into the other bay. One of the ASUS drivers on the CD is hardcoded to exist on drive C:, which means  if you intend to put the OS on the new SSD you need to configure the SSD to be drive C. EaseUS Personal Partition Master is free, but you need a mild understand of UEFI.  When I installed the LiveUpdate package from the CD to my SSD, the system froze. LiveUpdate is NOT needed, so skip it. One reviewer complained the pointer tray in front of the keyboard was sloppily installed, but from his complaints I could tell he had not removed the cellophane covering the tray, which is a little difficult and you might even think there is no cellophane to remove.

Amazon was going to wait until they received the defective laptop before shipping me another. After I complained they did me the favor of sending a replacement immediately. The laptop arrived in a box that had had a rough life (the first laptop box was pristine). In addition the bottom panel was not completely seated. Since the packing is so good this only meant that someone had opened laptop and was too hurried to close the panel properly.

Although I followed the process outlined on the Asus web site the upgrade resulted in this shutdown issue. Eventually I did a clean install but still had the same problem until I updated the BIOS. My log shows I have not had a shut down in the two months since.I am giving this unit 4 stars since the first unit failed. Also this is the bottom model in the Asus G75 line so there are better units. Still I agree that this is an incredible laptop for the price. The cooling power is great since it is designed to handle GPUs that draw lots more power. The laptop handles everything I throw at it. definitely happ now.

I open up 5 to 6 browser windows, some programming editors, and leave music running in the background- I load up windows in a virtual box. Where as Windows 7 takes a toll on most laptops, on this laptop, I can run Ubuntu, then run Windows on TOP of that at the SAME TIME, and the laptop still doesn't slow down the least bit.- Leave several files downloading- Leave some data-mining software running in the background which is one of the most cpu/harddrive intensive things you can doVery often, I'll do all of the above all at once, and yes, the laptop still handles it like a champ.

As of today, I will be sending it back. Below are the Pros and Cons of this machine.Pros:Speed - This machine was quick to boot and ran everything I threw at it with ease.Graphics - Everything looks great! I can run most games on max settings with max AA and not see any dip in framerate.Aesthetics - This laptops looks large and in-charge. It is power hungry, and shows it.Cons:Wifi - Wifi is intermittent on the RoG line of laptops. You can confirm this on the ASUS forums. Losing connectivity multiple times over the course of a day is annoying (especially when gaming).Graphics on battery power - This machine is HORRIBLE when forced to run on battery power. Although I don't plan on using it on batter often, it is a pain to struggle through a game in what looks like a slideshow.Backlit keyboard - Light bleeds through the keys. This looks cheap.Windows 8 - Ok. I have nothing bad to say about Windows 8. I actually like it. BUT - OEMs no longer include stickers on the bottom of machines so that you have access to your key. Good luck on installing Windows on a new hard drive without pirating a CD. ASUS was no help, nor was Microsoft.ASUS Software - The ASUS software would not install on my new ssd (thus new Windows install). I contacted ASUS and was alerted that I MUST be using the original HD for this to function.Overall a good laptop, but the shortcomings were not something I could not workaround. This leads me to have to give the RoG G75 two stars.

I bought this one because it had way more power than the Best Buy edition, which was cheaper.  However, for 250 dollars more, you get 16 GB of the fasted RAM available for this laptop (1600 Mhz), a faster harddrive, and a FULL HD screen along with much better warranty offers from Asus and Square Trade if you want an extended warranty.  (I got one because my G50Vt-X1's graphics card died after only three years, and had problems long before it died from overheating.)  This laptop allows you to access the fan housing in order to clean out accumulated dust without voiding the warranty.  That is crucial to protecting the graphics card from overheating.  The dual fan assembly was a major reason I bought this laptop.That being said, it is equipped with a pathetic Atheros wireless network card that has an effective range of about 5 feet tops.  After wasting countless hours \"configuring\" Windows to recognize wireless networks all around me, I finally just unplugged it and carried it to the room with the transmitter and set it down about 3 feet from it -- instant internet access!  No more problems.  If you plan to use an ethernet cable, this laptop will probably be ok, but it cannot connect to wireless networks more than 5 feet away, so keep that in mind before buying.  It is a hardware issue, as many have compained about the Atheros nic card's lack of range.For gaming it does fine, which is what I bought it for.  I am still amazed that the intake air vents are on the bottom of the \"laptop\" since this guarrantees a constant inflow of lint and dust, or no air inflow at all.  When will they learn?I don't recommend carrying it around, as the weight is significant and just lifting it can damage the CD drive on the left side, which bends when I pick up the laptop.  I put it on a cooling fan platform just so I would not need to grip the laptop when moving it around.  I think this is really the first laptop that is truly a desktop replacement, as it is nearly as big as a desktop itself.  The screen is great!  I really do like it and I like that it can be connected to an even larger screen if need be.I think my sons will enjoy playing games on this laptop, and I do recommend the laminated skin they are offering since the rubber surface is not easy to clean once there is an oily fingerprint on it.  (I think they knew that).  I also recommend a wireless bluetooth mouse instead of using the trackpad, but I do like the positive click of the pad buttons.  The backlit keyboard is a great idea for late night usage when others are asleep.So, for the money, I think this is a pretty good deal.  I am giving it a 4 because of the weak wireless card that will make it difficult or impossible to connect to the internet unless you have your own transmitter nearby.  Since I do not plan to use it for internet surfing, this is not an issue for me, but might be a serious issue for others.UPDATE:  After taking my laptop to the public library, I set it up as far as possible from the wireless transmitter, and it did detect the network and connected to it, but the signal strength was poor.  As I moved it toward the router, it improved, but never reached full signal strength.  It did work fine at the library, but then there were no walls involved.  I think this network card will only work with routers close by, but it does seem to work.  It is not nearly as good as my G50vt-x1 wireless network card, which I am using to write this from home.

Didn't get the laptop back until 1/28. on 2/8 I call because the power adaptor has stopped working.  I verified that it was the adaptor by replacing it with one from another Asus laptop with the same power specs. First I was required to argue with the agent about if the product was under warranty(because Dec to Feb is always more that 90days) but he would gladly sell me a new adaptor. Finally agreed that an in warranty rma was justified. Explain to me how it would happen exactly as before and we would be down for another 2+ weeks. When I asked if we could do something to make it faster like some sort of advanced replacement, I was told no.  I asked to talk to a supervisor because I figured since this was the second issue a higher level of service was warranted. Robert a supervisor in the support department told me that was policy. oh and what the agent didn't make clear is they wanted me to send in the entire laptop again because the adaptor doesn't have a part # or serial #.  If that didn't annoy me, while I was looking at the adaptor I noticed it had a part # ADP-150NB D  and right below that is a serial number. Did Robert like that? Didn't matter policy is policy I can send everything in if I wanted a replacement.  Their policy saved them money, I will take the $50 it cost to ship the laptop the first time and buy a generic power adaptor.

It's not really meant to be on a lap, I don't think, as it is rather heavy, but if you don't mind that, you'll find that most of the heat exhausts out of the back. It gets a little warm underneath during longer sessions, so I may yet get a cooling pad, but it's not a huge concern. (And frankly, this behemoth is really all I can handle on my lap. *insert dirty joke here*)-Huge, good looking screen that is all but glare-proof.-Backlit keyboard. (Fn f4)-Comfortable hand rests.Cons:-The mousepad. Sometimes it doesn't respond for a few seconds, and sometimes, it senses a tap when I'm pretty sure I'm not tapping. It's also big, which is itself fine, but it means that when controlling using \"wasd\", you are going to brush it. Not a huge problem, as Fn f9 will turn the touch pad off, but kind of annoying.-It's only technically portable. The awesome cooling fans and the associated vents do mean that there is a small selection of bags that will fit it. (May I suggest the Everki Beacon laptop bag with gaming console sleeve, for which I am about to write a positive review when I am done here?)-Friggin' Windows 8, man. But there aren't many laptops without it. Suck it up, I guess. That's my advice.Overall, for the price, I feel like I got a great deal.

Save yourself the hassle and go with Samsung, Alienware, MSI, or whatever other manufacturer, but stay FAR away from Asus.

First, the basics:The package arrived on time, and in good condition.  The computer was very simple to start, and setup to my desires.  The video card needed an updated driver, but everything else was up to date.  There was some \"fluff\" software, but nothing too annoying.  The computer looks sharp, and most settings are easily changed.  I especially liked the backlit keyboardGraphically, the computer works great.  Its able to run most games on the highest, or second highest setting.  I ran Skyrim, heavily loaded with high-res texture mods with no issues at all.  Nvidia is also extremely easy to deal with if you're unfamiliar with drivers and software.Sound wise, this computer is a bit of a failure, though not in a \"game breaking\" way.  The speakers are lackluster, and don't put out too much sound.  The computer also has an awful time recognizing sound hardware.  If you're in the middle of a game, and your SO asks you to kill the sound, your only option is to mute it (which is easy given shortcut keys on the keyboard), or to exit the game, and put in headphones.  The laptop will not input any already running sound into the headphones, so you must completely shut down whatever game/video/program, you're running, put in headphones, then restart.  Even then you will occasionally get sound on both the speakers, and headphones, forcing another full restart.If you'd have asked me what I thought about this laptop two weeks ago, I would have said 4 stars.  Its a great computer, that runs fantastically, for a reasonable price.  However, exactly one week after the manufacturer warranty expired my computer refused to start.  While I am not an expert, I believe the BIOS card has broken.  Luckily I had purchased a warranty (via square trade, so far service has been great).  Even if I hadn't purchased a warranty, I am confident that Amazon.com would repair/replace it given how close it is to the original warranty.  Nonetheless, it is unacceptable for a product this expensive, to have such a fundamental failure, so early in its service life.While I will continue to use this computer if it can be repaired, I definitely won't purchase an ASUS again, and I strongly recommend any one thinking of purchasing this laptop to get am extended warranty with it.", "Date": "October 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Stop and read this before purchasing", "Author": "K. Roark", "ReviewID": "R15XSTUE02EGKD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had my Asus G75 series (nVidia 660m, 16gb ram, win. 7) for nearly six months now and love the machine. I feel it's the perfect fit for the average-to-avid gamer/college student, and at a price that can't be beaten. That being said, here are my biggest gripes and most important pieces of advice for anyone who's considering a purchase.1. The audio bug many reviews speak of was/is a driver-related issue. If you have no gripes about day-1 updating (you should always do this anyway) then the issue is resolved after installing the updated audio and chipset drivers.2. Asus' customer service isn't as poor as some would make it out to be. I've spoken with them often about the audio issue (and another issue I've had that I'll cover later in more detail) and have always dealt with helpful and generally knowledgeable people.3. The touchpad is buggy at times. Even after turning the multi-touch function off (highly recommended, it's not usually worth using), I still experience issues where the cursor will jump either to the far left or near-bottom of the screen. It's most pronounced when dragging the scroll bar on a browser page, but can occur at any time. This issue is confined to the touchpad though, so it won't be a problem when using a mouse.4. The 660m is plenty to run most games at max to near-max settings without any issues. Some complaints of the card not keeping up come from the same issue my machine has.And the big issue, which is the whole reason I'm taking the time to write this review:5. The G75 comes standard with an Atheros wireless card. The issue arises from Atheros' hit-or-miss driver and card production. In short, you may/will have lag spikes due to DPC latency. In layman's terms, WiFi gaming can be anywhere from flawless to completely unplayable. Asus can't fix it over the phone if one of their driver updates or a clean windows install doesn't fix it, it's really a hassle, and the odds of the problem popping back up are medium to high. My suggestion to you if seriously considering this or any Asus laptop is to have an online PC builder such as xoticpc or any other reputable site you trust build one for you with an upgraded wireless card. You'll spend $50-100 more and miss out on amazon prime 2-day shipping if you have the option, but it's well worth it to avoid the hassle and still keep your Asus factory warranty. In addition, you can also grab a few more bells and whistles if you want them while you're there.Were I able to go back six months and make a different decision on which high-end laptop I purchased, the only thing I would change would be the wireless card.

I think this was because the AC plug was right next to the fan and the computer itself was basically a blowdryer, billowing out hot air.
