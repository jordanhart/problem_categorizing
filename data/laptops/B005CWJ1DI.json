I had the HP Envy 17. i7 with 8 gb of ram 640 gb hd as my last computer.I like windows 7, its a very good platform. But I think I've been turned into an Apple guy. The computer like others say is beautiful, but along with that it's well made. The keyboard not having a numbers pad took some getting used to but the lay out of the keys with backlighting is great. The speakers aren't great but they are good enough. The startup & shutdown is fast. I've added windows7 to it so I have it if I need it.The battery doesn't last 7 hours but it does last quite awhile, much longer than my HP with extended battery did. The battery life makes it great for school as I dont have to charge it in class. The only time its gets hot is watching flash videos.

Let me also state that this is not my first macbook or apple product either. I have a macbook (2006), an iPad, iPhone and multiple iPods. But after having opened the packaging on my latest Macbook pro, I cannot believe how easy to use and frustration free it is compared to the PC. The trackpad is simply magical, Browsing has become a pleasure again, after having suffered with kludgy gestures with the Fujitsu, it feels like a dream to be browsing and pretty much doing anything on the Macbook pro. I am a heavy trackpad user normally and this is a dream come true for me. Of course this is still early days for me and I have not really put the performance of the macbook to test yet  and am hoping to update my review once the honeymoon phase wears off.

This time around I had it held at the sorting facility.The MacBook was easy to setup and start using just like previous Macs I have owned. One thing I like is that the Macbook comes out of sleep very quickly and is ready to go. Others have complained about the battery life but I haven't had any problems. I use it for college to write papers and do research. The new gestures in OS Lion toke a little bit to get used to but not a big deal.

The trackpad and battery are such great conveniences especially since I'm using mine for college. It looks great, runs great, and EXCELLENT customer service from Apple.Alright I've spent 30 minutes trying to think of other things that I like about this laptop. Now here's the thing, it's probably just me, but I don't see anything that makes this laptop better than a PC. My main reason of getting this laptop was to see how great it was, since everyone was talking about it, and recommending it to me. I've had it for 4 months now, and I have no clear idea of how it could beat a laptop that's half its price. I love playing Starcraft 2, but I have to run it on the lowest settings, while my PC with the same specifications can run it on high. So either right now, there's nothing different, or I'm not utilizing my Macbook Pro to its fullest potential. If I am, someone please comment so I could get a better experience with this.Don't get me wrong, it's still a great laptop, and I love the thing, but I do regret switching. I swear I'm not a troll looking to start a PC vs Mac war, I just want to state my opinions, and hopefully someone tells me whether I'm wrong or right with a reason why.EDIT: Let's make this clear, I didn't buy this laptop for gaming. I bought it mainly based on recommendations, battery life, and durability.Thanks Nathan and Geib, I just ordered the 8 GB RAM, and it should be here soon. I don't think I would've searched for them since, I didn't think they'd be that cheap (well... not cheap, but a low price compared to what I was thinking haha).As for viruses, I never got them with my PC, but it's nice to know that it's not just luck that I'm not getting them lol.", "Date": "November 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "expensive but wow", "Author": "Mike5m", "ReviewID": "R1ROS93F0OLJOZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "awesome computer ive had since they released this version only downside is it gets pretty hot when playing games or movies.

My machine was loaded with the Lion OS, and while I didn't find the interface to be as wonderful as I was told, I was fairly satisfied with my experience until last week.  My hard drive died.  I backed up my data regularly, so this was only a disappointment in having to spend the additional money on a new one within a year of purchasing the laptop.  However, retrieving the OS through Internet Recovery has been a nightmare.  I can't simply download the software from a PC and then load it to my Mac. That's not an option at all.  It must be downloaded from the non-functioning Mac through Apple's servers that error out every time I try to download it through Internet Recovery. I connected the machine via ethernet cable to my modem and temporarily turned off network security in order to download the OS.  To absolutely no avail, it never would download! Because this wasn't under warranty, I would be charged $100 for an authorized repair provider to load it to my machine.  Absolutely ridiculous! Apple advertises there is no need to purchase a copy of the OS (and no longer offers another way to purchase a copy of it), since it can be retrieved through Internet Recovery. That method should work!  I've checked and double-checked, and there is no reason on my end for these Internet recovery errors to continuously occur. Since Apple no longer sells the thumb drive with Lion loaded, I had to go through a third party to purchase it (still less than taking it to a repair shop).  Should I have created my own recovery thumb drive prior to this occurring?  Clearly, I'd say yes now, and have always created bootable cd's for my PC's in the past.  However, Apple advertises a service that supposedly allows the user to always have access to the OS in emergencies such as these, but it fails to deliver as advertised.  This is a big issue, in my opinion, and has definitely turned me off of their overpriced products.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Worth the price", "Author": "Gerald", "ReviewID": "R33TEITAY3VGP6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After considering many lower cost PC options, I went with the MacBook.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Overall design factors include a superior track pad interface, solid construction, back-lit keyboard, superior OS, terrific display, etc.  There are some higher end PC notebook solutions available but the cost difference really isn't that much between these solutions and the MacBook.  You get what you pay for and them some with this MacBook.I have no need to use an external mouse with this notebook due to an inferior track-pad interface found on most PC notebooks.  I have observed that the mouse pointer will jump around at times on PC notebooks due to sensitivity issues.  Other reviewers have observed the same behavior. This is likely due to the sensing of the palm by the track-pad.  Additionally, the track-pad on the PC solutions is often too small.  Often, these solutions need to include at least two buttons for left and right clicking and sometimes four just to accommodate users who are accustom to using buttons on the top or bottom of the track-pad.  The track-pad on the MacBook is a button itself and that is all that is needed.  Apple in effect is telling users to evolve and you will be better off.One thing worth noting about the MacBook is it does have sharp edges.  This allows the notebook to close such that there is no gap around the perimeter of the notebook.  However, if you are a user that rests your wrists on the notebook while typing instead of letting them float above the keypad, you will get many creases on your wrists and will likely feel some irritation.  This may ultimately result in more significant wrist injuries. When I first started using this notebook, my wrists did exhibit these creases so I adjusted my typing position by floating my hands above the keyboard as recommended.  Problem solved!  Apple design engineers are in effect saying \"learn to type correctly.\"  Additionally, I purchased the following item to place the MacBook in a slanted orientation.  It also helps with heat dissipation and is very portable.  Having the notebook in the slanted orientation will also fix the issue with the sharp edges if you insist on not floating your hands above the keyboard while typing. I highly recommend it:Hercules X-Stand Ergonomic Portable Natural Airflow Cooling Stand For all 12-17\" Laptop / Notebook ComputersI decided to go with the 1680 x 1050 display rather than the lower resolution display.  I believe that this is definitely worth the extra money.  Additionally, I considered the matte screen to mitigate the effects of screen reflections but ultimately decided to go with the glossy screen due to its vibrancy.  There can be issues with reflections so if you are a user that has a window directly behind you or work in an environment that has bright lights, you may want to opt for the matte screen. Reflections have not been an issue for me.  I recommend the glossy screen for most users.My system has 8 Gig of RAM.  Running a few applications will eat up memory fairly quickly.  Once memory runs low, the OS will need to swap memory to the hard disk thus compromising performance.  According to Apple, use of RAM that is not exactly the same as what is specified (same specs and manufacture) will void the warranty.  You may want to consider that if you are looking at the possibility of adding your own RAM which you can do for significantly less than what Apple charges which is $200 for 4 Gig more than the base model which has 4 Gig of RAM itself.  Contact Apple first if you have any doubts about such warranty issues.In summary,  all of the components of the MacBook are integrated so well with the OS that it is truly the superior solution. This is simply because Apple has virtually complete control of the OS and hardware.  Without going into the technical details here, this makes a huge difference when compared to solutions based on Windows that need to accommodate multiple hardware platforms from many notebook manufactures.", "Date": "February 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop - Long time mac user", "Author": "Yolanda", "ReviewID": "R5NUQGHW7JP7D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was little concern about the battery and heat before my purchase because all reports that has been posted on the internet.

The switch wasn't nearly as painful as I expected and I still haven't mastered all of the quirks that are different between mac & windows; command v. control for example.

I was very surprised on how well the product was designed and the pleasure one gets just looking at it, its by far the best looking laptop out there, but once I started using it became apparent that I was in for a surprise.  I know a little more than the average user about computers and will let you know the pros and cons as I experienced them.Pros- Best laptop design out there. Very nice Aluminum design.- Very Good battery life.  Once the brightness is adjusted to auto.- Best trackpad i've ever used.  It can recognized whether I have 3 fingers on it or just one.  Great.- Backlit keyboard.  Very nice and it turns on automatically depending on light.- Great Webcam.  The webcam is great, very nice resolution.- Solid State Drive.  I payed extra for it but its definately worth it.Semi-consThese Semi cons are because of the awesome design.- Only 2 usb ports.- No additional battery support or interchangable for that matter. The battery is good but not infinite, need more juice.- Can't support mini discs but then again barely anyone uses those, but I mention it because I bought a amplified wifi adaptor that brought one and had to save the drivers on hd first.CONS (hardware)Where do I start there are so many cons that I will just focus on the ones that affected me directly.- No Bluray drive.  I have a PS3, tons of blurays and couldn't take any of my movies with me on the road.- No USB 3.0 support.  I bought a hard drive that is usb 3.0 but couldnt take advantage of the speed.  I have an internal SSD and the speed would've helped.- No HDMI built in. I had to buy a separate adaptor for it, this is a con because I payed $2200 for my Mac and I didn't want to spend more money.- The fan kept coming on when I was running Parallels in order to use much needed Windows features (read the other cons to know why).  A laptop fan helped ease that but I noticed the Aluminum was coming back to bite me on this one as it was loud.CONS (software)This is where I don't like this machine. At first it seemed I didn't need anything else and I would be able to do everything, but then it became apparent that I would be needing a lot.- No NTFS write support.  I found myself trying to copy things into my old hard drive and couldn't do it.  I would drag files to it and they wouldn't drop, no warning, nothing.  I did some research and found out that you can't do that without buying software.  At least Mac OS should let you know it's not supported, instead they choose not to let you know. Linux even supports this.- No games.  No games worth playing are available for the MacOS, I wanted to play some games on my down time and was surprised as to the games that are actually available.- Lack of software.  If I wanted to find a software for whatever it may be, all I had to do was search and I was almost guaranteed to find it for windows, with the Mac is kind of a surprise, \"like wow it's on the Mac too, sweet\".  Windows would be needed for lots of business programs.- Quicktime player.  I was wondering exactly what does Quicktime support and basically 2 file formats which didn't work for me since most of my stuff is in Divx and WMV.  I had to download VLC.  The main reason why this is a CON is because i shouldn't have to download a tool for every little thing I want to do.- Using Windows.  This is a con because Apple sells their operating system as the most advance but yet feel the need to include bootcamp so you can put Windows.  I don't get it but there are even companies that sell software so you can run windows within Mac OS which clearly fixes a lot of problems with Mac, but it shouldn't come down to that.  Windows doesn't support you to use MAC OS (even though Apple makes it illegal) or linux for that matter and i'm not talking about dual boot or virtual machines, I'm talking about using them at the same time like with Fusion or Parallels (virtual but integrates windows with Mac OS). The way I feel is that if you say your operating system is the best you shouldn't include a way to use the inferior one.  Obviously Mac OS lost points with me on that one, basically saying that they lack features and you should use Windows.- No customization.  You basically can't customize anything and I mean anything. its hard to find programs on there also, if you dont have them on the dock.The list can go on but these were things that bothered me and when you factor in price, this is not the best thing I couldve done for $2200 plus all the software.It looks nice but in the end falls short to live up to the hype of replacing a windows machine for the more advanced user.  I need the ability to own the system and customise it however I please.  In the end I decided to go back to a Windows 7  machine which can do anything Lion can do and much much more.  One of the main selling points was the lack of viruses for Mac, but I noticed that if you don't go looking around the internet for free stuff from shady sites or clicking spam, you shouldn't even need anti-virus for your Mac or PC.  Windows PCs are bigger targets due to more than 90 percent of the computers out there.I went back to the Apple store to return the product and they tried selling me on keeping it by telling me it can do all this stuff but once I started asking the hard questions I started getting \"it's a Mac\" from the salesperson, like I was supposed to forget about what I use a computer for and keep cause \"mac is cool\".  In my research the only thing that a Mac can do that a windows machine can't is run Apple made software like Final Cut Pro.  It became apparent at the Apple store that the main feature it offers is the ability to run Windows.I didn't like the product and hope my review will be able to educate someone on the fence on whether it is worth the price.  People will disagree with my review I'm sure but I have wrote the honest truth and no one can argue with the facts.  In the commercials Apple makes it sound like it's the most advanced thing ever and in the end maybe its too advance, coming from the future where no one uses Bluray, USB 3.0 or does actual work on their computers just surf the web and spend hours of time building ficticious farms.Thanks.Final word: Audi talks trash on BMW but doesn't feel the need to include a way to use a BMW engine in their cars.

Stephens", "ReviewID": "R1KX4NJRUHCKQR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Let me explain the title.Later this year, Apple will probably be replacing the current Macbook Pros with a machine more similar to the airs, no more optical drives, no native ethernet port and so on. So I decided to get this machine before they are gone for good. I have a 2008 Macbook unibody (the last model before they were called pros), and it has worked like a charm from day one, but it is getting older and will be used as a backup machine now that I have this one.I'm not going to get into the Apple/PC battle in this review, if you don't like Apple products, don't buy them. That will be all I will say on the matter.Now for this machine, I ordered a Seagate Momentus XT drive from newegg.com item #N82E16822148837. It is a 7200 rpm, 32 MB Cache, 6.0 Gb/s, Solid State Hybrid drive.(Check the reviews). I also ordered Corsair 16 Gb DDR3 1333 (PC3 10600) item #N82E16820233251. I got the machine and immediately switched out the ram and hard drive with the above mentioned items. After that, I turned the machine on, held command R, booted the computer from Apple's servers, restored from my Time Capsule backups, and I was in business. The ram was recognized, the hard drive is running like a charm. I now have a quad core proceesor, 16 Gb of ram and a hard drive that is almost as fast as an SSD, but with the the storage capacity of a traditional HDD. I am very happy with this machine and it should serve me for many years to come. BTW, I took the hard drive that came out of this machine and put it in my old Macbook, which only had a 250 Gb HDD, everything is working well. On a personal note, BACK UP YOUR HARD DRIVE. You can either use the Time Machine program that comes with your machine, or a free program called Super Duper, which clones you HDD. Your life will be soooo much easier if you back up your information. This machine is like any other multiple component machine, you may get a bad component from time to time, that should not make you hate the whole machine. I hope this review helps someone and gives them some useful information and ideas.

Our selection is the 15 inch Mackbook Pro. Its the latest and greatest version. Overall it isnt bad, its just a laptop that happens to run Max OSX. I was never a really big fan of Macs mainly due to they charge more then what it would cost to build it better as a IBM Compatible. So lets get down to the nitty gritty.Pros, figure it like any other laptop other then it runs apples OSX. Which mind you is not your only option, you can dual boot to windows if you want, which I do. Excellent picture quality. Its slim and light weight.The Cons, I can be really picky here but will just put in the majors. Battery life is not even in the same zip code as they claim it should be misrepresentation for an out right lie on Apples part. It gets hot and I mean really hot if you run it with any kind of a workload. So you will need a laptop cooler that blows directly on the bottom of the case. You also get hit with Apples proprietary hardware ripoffs. Anything and I mean ANYTHING you want to do will require an apple product and it will cost you an arm and a leg. DO NOT buy from any apple to mac specialty store. Amazon sells it for about a fifth of what they want. I run my laptop through my widescreen monitor, apple wants 30 bucks for the adapter I got it off amazon for 6 bucks.I could REALLY pick it apart but will go gentle on it it is reliable and does good for 3d work. But if given a choice I would have picked an IBM compatible over a mac without even thinking about it.Wish I could give it half a star would be two and a half, I am not impressed for the insanely over price they are asking. Pick an windows laptop for one third the price and do the same job. I just didnt get a choice with it being the schools laptop of choice.

The Mac OS also crashed upon using bootcamp to install Windows 7 (I had to re-install the entire Mac OS). I was recommended Macbooks for being the best Windows laptops (even though I did not purchase it for that reason entirely), however this is very far from the truth.Most users of these Macbooks will not tell you the serious heating issues these laptops bring. It is almost required to download a fan manager for your mac because it is believed that the manufacturers did not set the speeds appropriately. However, the downside to raising the speed of your fan is that you're degrading the integrity of your system greatly.The monitor has serious glare issues and is set so low on the Macbook it can cause neck pains for anyone at 6-foot.Also, these laptops are NOT durable by any means. I have scratches all over mine from just placing it into my bag. And please do not pick it up with a cd/dvd inside the system, else you can very easily get it stuck. Not to mention knock the alignment off of your hard-drive (done it countless times and froze the OS).The keyboard feels cheaply made. The keys are flimsy and takes some time getting used to.The macbook also comes with a very small amount of peripherals. No SD card slot, HDMI, VGA, and lack of any ability to get a bluray player into it. Also, the USB slots are terribly placed (some USB components will block the other USB ports).The Macbooks sacrifice their comfort for looking pretty. And to be honest, I rather have my computer be comfortable and work as a tool for my advantage, than to make it look pretty.
