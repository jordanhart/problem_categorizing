Patterson", "ReviewID": "R9B3T39WITIDR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I base my review and rating on expected performance and overall quality for the price.This is a cheap laptop. HP looks like they cut corners every which way they could while giving it just enough to do what it should. You're not going to play the latest big-title games at even medium settings, if at all. You're not going to edit serious and heavy video. But for basic work and school, it more than suffices. It is slow, but for this class of laptop, it's still acceptable. The HP emblem on the cover is cheap; it looks screen printed. Nonetheless, my model has two USB 2.0 ports and a 3.0 port. The screen is good, keys are comfortable, and touchpad is responsive.It came with Windows 8, but I bought it strictly for Linux. This is a new system, with a recent video adapter that has limited Linux support. I couldn't get Fedora or Mint installed, but Bodhi Linux hopped on without complaints.Overall, for the price this is a fair deal. If you're looking for a basic laptop for light work or school work, this should be fine for your needs.", "Date": "May 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Jorge Dorta", "ReviewID": "RX2BBZSBIJ1B2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I didn't buy this computer from Amazon however it is a great computer.

HP is aware of the problem but does nothing about it.  Several repair places specialize in repair/replacing HP motherboards (haven't tried them), but it's expensive.  Please peruse the HP support forum and you'll see the lack of support for these poorly designed pc's.  I will never buy HP again.", "Date": "May 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Microsoft's WeI benchmark score, the raw numbers instead of a numbing rant. / 4.1 out of 8", "Author": "Anonymous \"Anonymous\"", "ReviewID": "RT0CMND1ZQDM5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Microsoft's WeI indicts it for 4.1 out of possible 8.The Microsoft Windows cash register in the drive thru lane scores better.Read the reviews at WalMart (the 15-G019 \"W M\" initials WalMart has the clout to demand)  if the specific gripes interest you since this model was specifically designed for maximum shelf appeal from customers less interested in researching the specs underneath.Commonly used Linux distro's struggle with the anemic AMD regardless if FGLRX drivers are pre-merged into Casper or gambling with modprobe, the hassles are endless and my excessive usage of jargon dispels naysayers reluctant to accept the brutal observation.Ubuntu 13 and LTS12, Mint from 16-14 all howled in protest and recoiled differently when determining compatible video before dropping into bash with barely an apology.IRONICALLY, BackTrack 5.3 loves the video driver and powers the 1GB Ethernet and WiFi w/o complaints, but foolishly  connecting a no longer supported operating system vulnerable to three year old attacks doesn't require explanation and anyone familiar with BT has already speculated that executing any security testing under these conditions just slaughtered the CPU making the whole setup unusable until removing the AC and battery.The rest of the box is superb, the optical drive is modern and fast when installed in a different computer, the robust BIOS simultaneously supports UEFI and CSM enabling the rescue of a marooned UEFI locked drive salvaged from a Toshiba last seen flung into oncoming traffic.The LCD is luxurious, the web cam is better than average, everything about the HP is above par until you turn it on.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.99", "Features": "AMD E1-2100\n4GB, 500GB, Webcam\nSupermulti DVD Burner, 15.6\" LED\nWindows 8.1", "Name": "HP Pavilion 15-g019wm Notebook PC, AMD E1-2100, 4GB, 500GB, Supermulti DVD Burner, 15.6\" LED, Webcam, Windows 8.1", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/418IrPoz2iL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IO54MLQ"}}
