They did everything in their power to make it a positive buying experience.  My transaction with that company was great.Second - It's a laptop all right.  Speakers are great.  Windows 8 tiles seem pointless.  Webcam is fine.  Two weeks in and the computer already seems to lag a bit when downloading, starting applications, or loading webpages, but who knows where in the process it's being slowed down.  All in all it's a good computer, but what gets me is the backlit keyboard.  It doesn't have one!  It's sold as having one, has a sticker right on the wrist-rest that says it has one, but the S55-A5176 does NOT have backlit keys.  If it does (as some reviews have said) it's hidden so well that it might as well not exist.  I've scoured the interwebs and found no cntrl key combo that works, no BIOS setting to flip at startup, nothing.  It doesn't take away from the experience, but what's up with that?", "Date": "March 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "Well-equipped and powerful!
