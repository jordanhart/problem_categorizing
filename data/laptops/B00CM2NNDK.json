{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Ultrabook with a few quirks that you may get used to quickly", "Author": "Al Gator \"Al\"", "ReviewID": "R2EKZDU9UFIEWA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "SECOND UPDATE===================(1) Speakers(2) Build(3) Temperature/fan noise(4) Tips(5) General Thoughts(1) Speakers: I know some of the professional reviews said they aren't the greatest but they are not terrible for the size.  No, you're not going to get blown away and you're not going to get deep bass.  The built-in speakers are located around the hinge, facing up and slightly toward the screen.  The sound doesn't get distorted at max volume and fills a standard room pretty adequately at max volume.  I'm sure the small size also provided some challenges for the engineering team, so I'm not disappointed.(2) Build: The more I play with it, I'm not convinced that it's mainly carbon fiber.  I sense that there is a decent amount of \"plastic-y\" material in there but I'm not complaining.  The only issue it gives me is the accuracy of the trackpad when not on a hard surface (see the second update to this review below).(3) Temperature/fan noise:  OK, I'll concede a little here with some of the other reviewers.  I'm not so concerned with the noise as much as I am with the durability of components that heat up this much.  Yes, when the fan gets going, the exiting air temperature is very hot, and the underside of the laptop is as well.  SpeedFan reported temps as high as 78 degrees Celsius (172 degrees F)!!  That's hotter than any other desktop or mobile computer I've owned without additional heat-mitigating mechanisms.  I just hope the components are able to handle that temp--at least it's an SSD instead of a traditional platter.  It's also a little bit away from the hot components.  The extended battery gives a little relief since it pushes the laptop up a little like a stand.(4) Tips: There are quite a number of Sony updates to install including a firmware/BIOS update.  When you click on the assist button the updates are listed under \"software\" instead of \"updates\".  I got an error message installing Intel Anti-Theft indicating that the device was not compatible with it.  It is.  I was able to fix it by going into the BIOS settings and clicking on enable TPM and AT (even though it already was).  After a few reboots, it recognized it OK.  One thing that drove me crazy until I figured it out... the only way to get to the UEFI and BIOS settings was from a \"shutdown\" state, then pushing the \"assist\" button.Another tip, this doesn't use the camera for light sensor as some have speculated.  It uses the dedicated sensor next to the \"assist\" button.  I personally do not like this since if a directional light is shining down on the device but not lighting the surrounding, it is thrown off.  I have LED lighting in the main room of my house and it is constantly auto-adjusting the brightness.  I believe there is a way to turn this off but I haven't played with it.  It also has issues with adjusting brightness when your arm blocks the light for a few seconds.  Why would your arm do that you say?  Oh, I don't know, maybe because it's a TOUCHSCREEN laptop!!  Come on Sony, so perfect in every other way!  Again, not so bad that I would return it.  I still think it's one of the best Haswell Ultrabooks on the market.Purchase tips in the first updated review below.(5) General thoughts:  I haven't bothered to fix my Android tablet yet (the Asus TF300T is a pain to replace the digitizer unlike any other device I've owned).  This has all but replaced my netbook and tablet that were used previously for separate tasks.  All in a footprint smaller than either one individually.  I am looking forward to the Windows 8.1 improvements.  I have not installed the preview.  I want to wait for the more stable release.  On another note, the Intel Anti-Theft is $6.99 for one year on Amazon here.Intel 1 Year Anti Theft Service for Ultrabooks and Laptops  Totally worth it for me.  I take this everywhere.FIRST UPDATE AFTER flying with this (and for the first time, without an additional tablet)===================(1) TRAVEL THOUGHTS(2) CASES(3) OTHER QUIRKS (\"Flex\", touchpad, wifi, fan)(4) TABLET REPLACEMENT?(5) PURCHASE TIPS(6) TAKE APART/DISASSEMBLY(1) TRAVEL THOUGHTS At first I thought a 13.3\" device would be too big to use on the airplane comfortably especially if someone in front of me reclined.  I must say this was not the case--furthermore, this is where the touchscreen really shines.  Since it is very light, I can hold it closer to me and use it like a tablet without having the keyboard get in my way.  The on-screen keyboard also helps for this.  I had to ask my colleague to hold the laptop for a second and when I handed it to him he was shocked at how light it weighed!(2) CASES: The EasyAcc 13.3 inch Laptop Sleeve Bag Case Cover Neoprene Shock Resistant Pouch Protective Handbag for Apple Macbook Air 13, Macbook Pro 13, Acer Aspire S3, Asus Zenbook UX31, Lenovo IdeaPad U300s, Samsung SERIES 9 NP900X3B, Toshiba Satellite Z830, SONY S... did NOT fit this ultrabook so be careful which MacBook Air Cases you choose.  I ended up using this Case Logic QNS-113 13.3-Inch EVA Molded Laptop / Macbook Air / Pro Retina Display Sleeve (Black) because it also lets me use the ultrabook in the case itself and I can also stash my second really thin screen (GeChic OnLap--read my review there) GeChic On-Lap 1302 13.3 USB Powered Thin Slim LCD Monitor with ThunderBolt/Mini Display Port Adapter for Apple Macbook Pro Air 13 in the same case!  I can also use the Case Logic 14\" Case Logic LAPS-114 14-Inch Laptop Sleeve (Black) but it doesn't let me use the laptop in its case.  TSA had no issues with either case and I didn't have to remove the ultrabook.(3) OTHER QUIRKS: So, I think I have figured out the problem with some people reporting touchpad sensitivity and issues.  The chassis is carbon fiber and has some \"flex\" to it.  Therefore, if the ultrabook is not fully on a hard surface, and more specifically, half on a hard surface and the palmrest hanging off, the touchpad must be getting compressed inside somewhere as it bends between the palmrest and the touchpad.  That is the only time I had issues.  If it were fully on a hard or soft surface it operated normally.  Imagine taking the laptop and pushing down on the palmrest while it is half over the side of a desk.  That is what seems to be happening with me at least.  Easy enough for me to adjust so it's a non-issue for me.The fan noise that people are complaining about I must admit can get annoying sometimes, but I have not tried too much in the way of intensive operations yet.  The initial DropBox sync (about 7GB for me) kicked up the fan a lot and it was noticeable.  In airports and other areas, it wasn't too much of a distraction, but time will tell if I will be the \"weirdo\" with the noisy machine in day to day meetings, etc.  Ah well, I guess I will have to avoid playing video games during my business meetings!I did not experience any major Wifi issues other than with networks that do not broadcast SSID's.  There are a large number of Sony firmware updates available so I would suggest installing them if you are experiencing issues with bluetooth, wifi, and NFC (which I haven't tried yet).  My problem is that the Sony Vaio Update app keeps getting an error so I will contact Sony shortly.(4) TABLET REPLACEMENT? My Asus TF300T's digitizer broke prior to my flight and it's a pain to replace so I haven't done that yet.  Needless to say, I've used the Sony Vaio Pro 13 in many situations that I would have used the tablet for and honestly, I feel less restricted than under Android limitations (read: multitasking, productivity office apps, etc.).  I have all but replaced it and since it actually weighs less than my TF300T with keyboard dock, I'm happy to be using this.  Yes, it's a little bit large for some situations, so I might hold out and get a decent 8\" Bay Trail tablet when they are released later in the year.(5) PURCHASE TIPS: So, after playing with this for a while, and knowing that some options are pretty expensive, here is what I can offer: most of the components are fixed and not upgradeable.  If you can afford it, go with the highest processor and memory that you can.  The memory is soldered to the main board.  The SSD, however, is Samsung's new XP941 PCIe \"M.2\" form factor SDD.  While they are not available for sale (that I could find) other than to OEMs right now, it is likely they will appear in the market soon.  Going from the base 128GB, it costs $220 for 256GB and $720 or so for the 512GB.  While the speeds are among the fastest you will see today for SSD, I might be willing to hold off on that, especially since it appears to be user-replaceable (no confirmation on that but see below).  Your best shot is to keep searching for them online and see when they pop up cheaper in the future.(6) TAKE-APART AND DISASSEMBLY:  While I have not tried it yet, there is now a good tear-down video [...] and pictures [...] so you can see for yourself.ORIGINAL REVIEW:===================In this review:(1) In the box(2) PROs (+)(3) CONs/Quirks (-)(4) Windows Experience Index Ratings, Battery Life, and Performance Observations(5) Extended sheet battery thoughts(6) Thoughts on travel/portability/business use(7) General Thoughts and Thoughts on tablet replacement(1) In the box: power cord and adapter with neat USB port in transformer, brief setup pamphlet, VGA Adapter.I thought I would include this section because there was some confusion as to whether the USB-powered Ethernet wireless router that attaches to the power adapter was included.  Sadly, it is not.  It is also not listed as available for sale (as of this date) in the US.  If you need the part number (since it's hard to find), it's VGP-WAR100 and is available on Sony Asia's website [...](2) PROs- Great battery life  (later)- Super thin AND great battery life!- full-size spacing on keys- Tight integration between hardware and Windows 8 (even some 8.1 features done Sony-style on Windows 8.0)- Screen lifts for the most part with one hand (better than I could have expected)- brightness is decent- Carbon fiber build seems flimsy (because it bends) but actually feels and appears to be durable (if that makes sense)- Really light.- Did I mention that it's really thin and light?(3) CONs/Quirks (not all are really terrible and I've overcome some as described)- Yes, there is a known WiFi issue.  Supposedly, Sony is working on a fix though not all their stores and call centers are familiar with it.  However, that being said, I did not experience any major issues.  Just in case, I have a WiFi adapter I can use if needed.- For me: lack of Thunderbolt port is a disappointment but I understand that Sony had to sacrifice some things for such a thin laptop.  I would have preferred Thunderbolt over HDMI but that is just me and the market supports the decision to stick with HDMI right now.- Lack of Gb Ethernet.  Really wished it had this but a lot of ultrabooks are forgoing this option these days.  To overcome this, I purchased a nifty Asus USB router (see below under travel)- The large amount of flex in the build makes using the touchscreen difficult to use or at least not as \"seamless\" as it could be.  The screen vibrates back and forth a lot with each press making for a slightly uncomfortable but bearable experience.  It certainly does not replace a tablet feel (nor is it meant to so no stars deducted).  It's just that it feels like the touchscreen could have been left out altogether but I must admit I still use it extensively over the touchpad (but maybe not over a travel mouse).- The sheet battery is not flush to the device (more on that below under the \"extended battery\" section).- The keyboard is a little awkward for me, but to be fair, I'm accustomed to a 12.1\" netbook keyboard.  The keys for me are spaced too far apart but I can still type pretty fast and it doesn't seem like it will take a lot of getting used to.- The lights for the backlit keyboard are visible from underneath the keys when you are looking at the device.  It's kind of annoying and I wish it were just the letters that were lit instead of an outline of the keys.- Silly dedicated \"assist\" button launches Sony's troubleshooting and repair/recovery apps.  I'd rather be able to customize a dedicated hardware button (and maybe I can?)(4) Windows Experience Index, battery life, and other performance measuresOverall: 6.3 (internal HD4000 graphics being the limiting factor)CPU: 7.1  (NOTE: This is for a Core i7 model, the rest of this review is relevant to this model)RAM: 7.6Graphics: 6.3Gaming Graphics: 6.3HDD: 8.6It isn't meant to be a super high-end gaming machine.  The idea here is thin and light...but seriously, it does a pretty darn good job at everything else while it's at it.  Data transfer rates are extremely good.  If I get a chance, I'll post some samples.Battery Life is really really good.  I use Battery Bar and it varies it's estimate based on use but going from a full charge on just the main battery without the extended sheet battery, it varies between 7-8.5 hours, way over Sony's 6.5 hours estimate.  To be fair, I have only been installing software and not anything otherwise intensive.  With the extended battery which is almost double capacity, I would easily believe Sony's 13-14 hour claim and then some.  Time will tell and I will update if this changes.Performance is pretty snappy and I haven't noticed any major hiccups but to be fair, I haven't done a whole lot other than web browsing and software installation.  I'll update as time goes on if it changes.(5) Extended Sheet battery thoughts:Honestly, I have mixed feelings.  Since there are really no pictures for this model, I thought I would post this so you have a good idea of what it is like.  I will post a picture soon as well.  For starters, it does NOT sit flush with the laptop.  In other words, it adds a significant amount of depth (almost double) but at least it is a smaller footprint and not the whole side of the laptop.  It serves as a stand while it is attached.  One thing I do wish: the cover for the connector for the extended battery can be difficult to remove form the laptop (it has a spot to reattach to the extended batteyr to hold it in place but even that is a pain to do in a hurry.  If I have to switch batteries in a hurry or switch to the extended, it can be irritating.  A sliding cover would have been more practical (but I'm not sure if it's feasible space-wise)(6) Travel and portability thoughts:For me, extended batteries are almost a necessity and I'm so used to just ordering them that I ordered it with the device.  As I am using this, I am actually thinking I wouldn't need it if I were just replacing my netbook/laptop.  Since the sheet battery adds such significant battery life, I might use it to replace what I normally defer to my Asus TF300T tablet for (notes, travel, work on airplanes/trains, etc.).I will update this review soon--I have ordered two different MacBook Air cases and will see how they fare.I also ordered the Asus WL-300NUL pocket WiFi router (ASUS Multi-Mode Pocket Router (WL-330NUL).  This can be used in much the same way as the Sony part I mentioned above with the added benefit that it can also be used as a USB ethernet adapter and standard WiFi adapter as well.For travel, I also ordered a USB combo mini outlet surge protector Satechi Compact USB Surge Protector for Charging MP3 Players, iPhone, Blackberry, Android, and Windows Mobile Phones and an inline surge protector TRC 90510-10 Lap Top Surge Protector 3-Wire which should arrive soon.(7) General Thoughts and Thoughts on Tablet replacement:I was really hoping for a Haswell ultrabook convertible that would double as my desktop via a nice Thunderbolt dock for two monitors, GbE, USB 3.0 drives, etc.  I was hoping for said ultrabook to also double as a tablet and take advantage of Window 8 handwriting recognition with a digitizer (this does not have a digitizer).  In the end, while this may have been a purchase out of frustration in waiting or the \"perfect\" device to come along, I think I am happy with it.  The near-instant on feature is nice so that certainly helps in pushing the case to replace my tablet.  I can still think of a need for a decent tablet with digitizer (perhaps a future \"mini\" Windows 8 tablet with Bay Trail?).  I thought about the Sony Duo 13 as well but the limited one angle kind of was a dealbreaker for me.  In retrospect, it might be more of what I was looking for.  The trackpad is becoming more and more of an after-thought for me as I use the touchscreen more so the fact that it is much smaller on the Duo may not be bad.  At least it isn't behind the keyboard like on the recently announced Samsung device.  The Asus Transformer Book Trio is probably the closest to what I wanted but it may not be released until much later this year.  For now, I would say I'm very happy with the purchase and will continue to evaluate my needs as I go on in terms of living without a tablet.I do hope that Thunderbolt becomes more common and is standard in the near future.  Partly due to cost and partly due to ignorance, I think people are missing out on something great that might be too early for it's own good.  It's almost like the \"Apple Newton\" was way ahead of its time and didn't succeed because of ignorance and cost until Palm released their version of the PDA when the market was \"ready\" for it.  I'm hoping this is the time for TB.", "Date": "July 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing Machine", "Author": "Drake", "ReviewID": "R2N6AO5KMT81ST", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this ultrabook. If you need to have the most portable laptop, look no further. At 2.3 pounds, this Vaio feels like nothing in my bag. The weight was the main selling point for me. I'm a student who constantly traverses campus with books and a laptop, and having something that weighs far less than my textbooks is a dream. Coming from a laptop that weighed nearly 6 pounds to this featherweight is a huge burden lifted from my shoulders.I would like to address some issues other owners are reporting with this machine. I have absolutely zero wi-fi problems. I'm getting exactly the same reception, speed and stability from this laptop and every other wi-fi device I own. It worked great for me out of the box.Some others also say the trackpad is awful. Honestly, I'm not really sure what kind of problems they're having with their trackpad. Mine works near flawlessly. There is an occasional hiccup when it fails to recognize my two-finger scrolling gesture for a brief second, but it happens rarely. Tracking is solid and smooth. Palm rejection is also excellent. No more jumping four lines of text while typing a paper!The fan noise can be an issue for some. Honestly, simple web browsing or word processing, this machine is silent. I have it running on the battery most of the time in the \"silent\" mode located in the Vaio control panel, and any ambient noise drowns out the whisper coming from the side of this device. Now, any type of huge processor strain will make the fan whirl just like any other device. My only complaint is the fan can be a little to aggressive while watching HD videos, but the noise from the video still drowns out the fan for the most part.Speaking of HD videos, the screen on this Vaio is absolutely sublime. Compared to the Macbook Air, screen quality is no contest. The viewing angles and sharpness on the Vaio are unmatched by the Air. Only other Windows ultrabooks(Acer S7, Samsung Ativ 9, Asus Zenbook Inifinity) can compare in screen quality. Some of those might have a higher resolution than the Vaio, but at 13\", 1920x1080 looks as sharp as I could possibly imagine. Colors are vibrant, blacks are deep, and whites are pure. There is a slight grain to it, but that's just an anti-glare coating. It's no matte display, but it does a better job at reflecting rays of light than a standard glossy display. For me, it's worth the trade off.The keyboard, for an ultrabook, is way above my expectations. I've felt some very shallow key strokes on other machines, but the click-clack from this Vaio is satisfying. Key travel is plenty for such a thin device. I have no problems with keystrokes not registering. The back lighting is also very nice. It is very even with very little bleed when looked at head on. I love having the lighting dim when not in use, then suddenly illuminate my keyboard when my fingers begin striking the keys.Port selection is decent enough. Two USB 3.0 with one supporting sleep charge, full size HDMI, a deep SD card slot with no stick out(unlike some Apple machines), a headphone/mic jack and charging. There is also a very handy USB 2.0 port on the power brick, so I can charge my smartphone from the brick instead of having to take up a USB port. Great add on feature!Build quality on this laptop has been a highly contested issue. Yes, the frame of the laptop can flex if you put ample force on it. But at normal typing pressure, the keyboard flex is minimal to nonexistent. It's a trade off for the 2.3 pound package. The carbon fiber keyboard deck has a nice matte, textured finish to it. It feels very premium. There are no panel gaps to speak of. The palm rest has a contrasted brushed aluminum which never gets too cold or hot to the touch. Sony also made the design so when the lid is closed, the screen is lifted slightly above the keyboard, so the keys do not rub against this beautiful display. I also love the slight angle created by the bottom of the hinge when the laptop is fully open. It makes for a lovely typing experience.Overall performance from the machine is blazingly fast. It boots in around 3 seconds, wakes from sleep instantly and opens apps in the blink of an eye. The new PCIe SSD gets 1000 mb/s reads and 900 writes! The processor and integrated GPU are enough for anything you would normally throw at an ultrabook.Battery life is probably the only let down on the device. I usually can get around 6-8 hours on my normal usage of web browsing, watching videos, and typing. It's enough to get me through the day, but it's no 10 hours from the MBA. If you need more runtime, Sony offers a sheet battery that doubles the runtime, and keeps the total weight of the device equal to the MBA.Overall, I am extremely happy with this laptop. I was worried reading the horror stories online about the terrible wi-fi and so on, but they are extremely small sample cases. My machine works flawlessly. I would without a second thought recommend this Vaio to anyone looking for a premium Windows ultrabook.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not Great", "Author": "D. Chisholm \"Dave\"", "ReviewID": "R2EAT72AHY6MBF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was in the market in a powerful yet light laptop and this one seemed to fit the bill. Got it home, and was rather impressed by how light and thin the laptop was, and how beautiful the screen was. Then I started typing and found I really didn't like the keyboard layout, the bottom half of the large return key was notched out in the bottom left quarter, so I ended up often missing the return key hitting the quote key.Then came by far the worst part, the track pad. I don't generally use mice with my laptops and a good trackpad is critical for me, and this one is terrible. It is not very sensitive, the cursor jumps around at times, and clicking often doesn't work. Even worse is that when you lightly press on the trackpad, you can feel the whole trackpad move, and it makes a noise when doing this. It does this the whole time you are moving your finger around the trackpad and drove me crazy. And just to be clear, I am talking about pressing lightly enough to where you are not actually \"clicking\" the trackpad.The way Sony got this laptop so light is by making it \"supposedly\" out of carbon fibre, the problem is this makes the entire laptop flex, and really badly at that. I don't know how much it can actually take, and it could end up not being a problem, but just carrying the laptop from one of the corners feels like you are going to snap the palm rest. There just isn't much structure here, maybe it will make it take a fall better, who knows, but it feels horrible.Lastly, sony loads this up with their software, and that software is terrible as all their applications are slow and crash often. There is one application that gives you a bunch of messages about your system, this program took over a minute to load.... On a laptop with a very fast SSD that can boot in something like 7 seconds.With all that said, the keyboard itself was pleasant enough (aside from the layout I am not used to), and the screen is great. If anything 1080p might be too much for a laptop this size because some text was just straining to read, hopefully windows 8 will get updated with better scaling for high resolution, smaller screens. The touchscreen also works well enough, but I wish the screen's hinges were stronger as the screen would wobble around a bit when touching it.The fan was also rather noisy, even on the silent profile in the Vaio Control Center, and speaking of loud the speakers weren't. Battery Life was also rather unimpressive, especially for a Haswell chip, but I'm sure windows 8 has more to do with that than anything.The SSD is awesome, fast as all heck, and 8 gigs of ram (4 will suffice for most too) is more than enough for pretty much any regular user. The CPU and GPU seemed to hold up to normal use just fine, but will not handle gaming very well.Overall, the cons just outweighed the pro for me (get it?). Ended up returning the laptop.*************I should also note that I experienced no issues with Wifi, but I believe sony or intel patched that issue. I am not sure if all the reviews complaining of horrible wifi are relevant now.", "Date": "September 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Amazing laptop, but one glaring issue", "Author": "aooga", "ReviewID": "R34RCAWBWVJZBH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "**UPDATE**The temps on this laptop can get very hot if you don't watch them. I got to 73C today just watching Netflix. I even wiped the drive and reinstalled from the recovery partition and it still does it.And to comment on other people saying the screen is glossy, I actually don't find it glossy at all. Its actually a weird middle between glossy and matte. I don't know what Sony did. Its nice though.**OLD REVIEW**Just as a intro, I didn't buy this laptop on Amazon, so it wont say verified purchase, but I did buy this laptop and still have it with me, so you can be assured that this is a real review. I absolutely love this laptop. Everything is amazingly fast and snappy, the trackpad is smooth and gestures handle very well, almost as well as a Mac.The keyboard is also pretty great. It feels like I'm typing on a desktop keyboard because of how much travel the keys actually have. I think this is the most I've ever seen in an ultrabook. Now for the best thing about this laptop.The weight. Its incredible. When I took the laptop home with me, I was actually worried that the box didn't have the laptop in it! (It did). This thing feels as light as my tablet.Now for the screen, its a full 1080p screen, the clarity is good, and so are the viewing angles. Surprisingly, they're not as good as an IPS screen, but more than acceptable. The touch is also responsive. The one thing that I did have to do is when I got it, the screen was really sticky and I couldn't slide my finger on it. I cleaned it with some rubbing alcohol and now its as smooth as anything else.But, there is one major (to me) issue. The fan noise is horrific. Even when I'm just browsing the internet, the fans are on at ~4000-5000 RPM according to Core Temp. And the weird thing, is that they SHOULD be on at the temps I'm getting. On idle, its around 50C. I've used many other ultrabooks and I know that's not normal. In fact, I unplugged the fan of a Lenovo Yoga (It was also loud) and it never exceeded 55C even when watching movies. This can't be fixed with an update because the laptop actually DOES run hot, so the fans are needed. I checked for any CPU hogging apps, but the CPU is never over 10% utilization in Task Manager. I know I don't have a defective unit, because I already took it back and replaced it once. Oh, and the SONY Vaio Control Center fan options don't do anything to control the fan.I think other than that, this laptop is amazing. If you never use your laptop in a Library, Classroom, or another quiet place, It would be 5 stars for you. But Its just way too loud for me.I feel that to deserve 5 stars, it need to be perfect, and this laptop comes close, but isn't. If anyone/Sony somehow releases an update to quiet those fans, I'll change my review. It would be 5 stars, but the fan and the flex on the body knock off one star for me.To sum up:PROS:- Amazing Screen- Roomy and comfortable keyboard- Smooth trackpad- VERY light- Looks great- No bloatware at all (since I bought it from the Microsoft Store)CONS:- Fan noise is terrible- Some amount of flex in the body makes it feel weak", "Date": "June 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "The return of the King", "Author": "Redfan", "ReviewID": "R1JA272KD07G43", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought the laptop in a Sony store after falling in love the moment I saw it. It is simply stunning. There is no going back to my Ideapad now. This is the kind of technology that Sony stopped producing in the last decade. Boot up in 3-5 seconds. Shuts down in 5. Applications start instantaneously, excellent wifi range. Killer display. Responsive touch(on internet explorer, Firefox unfortunately isn't optimized for Win 8)Seven hours battery .The body is a bit flexy-but I think that was the intention, to keep it flexible so it can stand the rigors of being handled around, and at 1 kilogram-it WILL be handled around.Track pad misses some taps- but it is by far one of the best non-apple trackpads.I went to the Apple store to see if I let my heart rule over the mind (the supposed 12 hour battery life of the new Air), and I simply came back, clenching my Vaio closer to me. Drab heavy silver slabs.

Rathbone", "ReviewID": "R1QKV2PMYJMK44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As of writing, the only laptop that really compares to this is the Macbook Air.  You do get less battery life with the Vaio, however in exchange you get a faster processor, higher resolution screen, smaller machine, lighter machine, touch screen, faster SSD drive (sony uses PCI-E connector), better screen (according to reviews I saw, the triluminous display is better than MBA's screen.So, In my mind it's worth it.  I've only had it for a few days but I can tell you it's pretty good at playing Civilization 5 and web browsing.  The touch screen is handy for both these tasks actually.  Also, a good thing to note is the SD card fits all the way into the laptop instead of sticking out like on some other laptops.What do I dislike about this laptop?If I am resting my hands on the laptop and trying to click using the track pad, it sometimes doesn't work.  Because of the way the carbon fiber body flexes, it sometimes flexes in such a way that makes it impossible to click.  To get around this, i have to raise my hands a little bit, then I can click.  This is a little annoying.Also, I have found that it is not possible to boot from the SD card slot.  This will probably not matter to most people, but I was hoping I could boot an alternate linux partition that would exist on the SD card to save space on the SSD drive.  I dont' want to put it on the SSD because I'll only occasionally need to boot into that OS.  This means I will have to use a USB drive to hold my Linux partition.  Life is difficult sometimes.I purchased the base model with 4GB memory and 128GB SSD.  It's still great.  Exactly what I was looking for in a laptop. Sleek, thin and fairly fast.  If you're considering a Macbook air, in my opinion this is worth the premium unless you really want to use OSX.Update:If possible install a fresh version of windows 8.1 onto this laptop.

THe wifi that ships with the computer only stays connected for about 5 minutes before disconnecting. Which of course isn't long enough for Sony's INCREDIBLY slow support site download of the newer 80MB driver (45 minutes to download...). Had to manually download on another computer and copy over on USB to actually get it installed. Now the Wifi works for a few hours, and then stops connecting to websites, even though it shows full bars on the Wifi meter. There are dozens of complaints about the Wifi (25 pages and counting on one support thread) on the Sony site.The hardware otherwise is fine, though I want to know where they get off charging 80$ for an extra power cord. It does have a usb charging port on the back of the power supply brick, but the sony answer to not having a magsafe connection ala Apple, is to make the cord so loose that it falls out all the time.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Design / reliability issues, don't buy", "Author": "Ivan Gill", "ReviewID": "R28NXWKJBSV62L", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "My First Impressions was this is an am amazing machine and a perfect evolution from the SZ and the Z.The GoodGreat screen,Decent Keyboard.Can work all day on battery with the 2nd battery attached (but only just it's more like 8 hours than 18 hours battery life.There is an option in the vaio control centre to swicth between active and passive cooling.

It actually works well when you get used to it. What is poor is the left and right buttons. There are no separate buttons and pressing on the bottom left and right corners of the Touchpad doesn't work!! The sweet spot for them is about 2cm in from each corner.

SAND they still don't have a fix. f this isn't resolved.I bought the carbon Fibre i7 option. Passive cooling through the case is nothing like as good as a Metal cased Acer S3 at 1/3 the price or a mac book air etc. The result is the CPu is constantly clocked down for thermal management even with active cooling. I can only manage short bursts at full speed. The result of ths is my Acer S3 i5 Gen3 laptop is consederabley faster than this i7 Gen4 (Haswell)I could forgive the performance throttling to get the leight weight and amazing battery life, I would buy the i5 instead of wasting money on the i7.However the Wi-Fi is unforgivable, the machine is a clunker, I am going back to my 3 year old Sony Z", "Date": "December 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good, but not for the faint of heart", "Author": "Thomas C.
