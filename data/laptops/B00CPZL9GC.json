I like the way the NE series is put together. The keyboard layout is fantastic. Specially the Function Keys(F1-F12). They are setup so when pressed alone, what is pictured on them is what action is taken. No more useless keys for beginners. It has a nice screen with good graphics, even looks great when using the HDMI output. It has WiFi and Bluetooth. Had only 2 downfalls since purchase. One downfall, though minor, is that there is no internal optical drive(ie: cd/dvd rom). If you install one on your own you void the warranty, so buy an external USB drive. The second downfall is that I had some minor issues shortly after setup(mouse pad issues, screen going blank, etc....), DON'T BE ALARMED. All I did was run a system refresh with the help of Gateway. Has been PERFECT ever since. So I don't believe what others are saying about this laptop. Other than that, the laptop is great for the price and is perfect for students, general everyday users or for those getting their first. Comes with enough hard drive space and memory for most people. I would recommend this to other, definitely. Just not to those who are deep into high end gaming or programs that need a lot of system resources.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not for the price!", "Author": "Tess Krane", "ReviewID": "R3H1W6MHW4EBR1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Really, you need to specify there is no optical drive included especially at this price.

Rose", "ReviewID": "R35NQJITC8EJB8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Note that if you buy this, you will have to get an external CD/DVD drive. This computer has been listed at $199.99 at Target before (where I purchased mine) and will likely continue to go down in price until it is phased out. It's cost effective, but you do not have the benefit of a CD/DVD drive already being a part of the computer. Also, with Windows 8, it does take some getting use to. Furthermore, you have to purchase Microsoft Office electronically and download that since there is not an internal drive to install the 2007 or 2010 disc versions and since there is not a trial version existing on the computer itself. As a side note, I noticed with the newer versions of Office they are only licensed for one computer, with the exception of the $200+ Office suites.If you decide to buy this computer, do yourself a favor and buy an external DVD drive (with external drives priced the way they are, I'd recommend going with a Blu-Ray external drive). Beyond this, find a free word processor and free spreadsheet program and you should be set.This computer would be great if this had an internal disc drive, but for the price point, it's pretty hard to beat unless you get an Asus or Acer.", "Date": "December 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "excellent product", "Author": "Rosaura", "ReviewID": "R1TGG955STMXN3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "came very fast at this time bellisima'm using is the only thing is the processor that is very slow but the rest I really love the camera to best thanks for such a good product and attention.", "Date": "February 24, 2014"}, {"Title": "PERFECT XMAS GIFT!

However, after going through 5-6 older $300 lap tops, I have to say this is the worst screen quality I have ever seen.  The contrast is harsh, the sharpness is very low and the general skin tones are unrealistic.  To be clear, the problems are with jpeg files and video, not graphics.If you plan to watch anything of quality, just skip this series of Gateway.  Regardless of how I adjust it, the same things I watched on my $300 D**l which just died are just trash on this machine.  They really cut corners here.  If this is the future of LED technology, I want none of it.Added:  I am beginning to wonder about this screen.  I tried everything I could to adjust the screen and could not make it better.  Then, for a different issue, I have had to do a few recovery cycles going back and forth and back and forth, ending up where I started and now the screen looks much better.  Very odd.", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CPZL9GC"}}
