Huston", "ReviewID": "R2F09E4HSVO9WP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "this laptop is what it is - a cobbled together, undocumented frankenstein of a notebook.first, the good: battery life is great. not record setting, but perfectly acceptable. I was skeptical of windows 7, but it's turned out to be pretty damn solid.the guts are quality components. i've had zero issues with any of the hardware. it's fast and just all around good.now the bad:this is an off brand laptop, so you wont be getting apple or dell build quality. it's a bit flimsy. the display is not good. it has an extremely limited vertical viewing angle. blacks are more gray than anything. it only looks good viewed dead on in a semi-dark room. the trackpad is inaccurate and it is not possible to disable tap-to-click. this wouldnt be a big deal except that it is very easy to brush it when typing, which will move the cursor to wherever the mouse is. this is a constant pain and the #1 thing i wish MSI would address. I have buttons for clicking, I do not need nor want tap-to click.everything else is fine - the HDMI is sweet, the optical drive is fast and capable, 3gb is plenty of RAM, and the hard drive is adequate. the keyboard is acceptable - nothing special, and it takes some getting used to it being offset due to the numeric keypad.but it's cheap. damn cheap. cheaper than any other similarly spec'd laptop. and that is its saving grace.you have to understand, MSI is not traditionally a laptop manufacturer, they are laptop assemblers. this computer is cobbled together from whatever parts they had laying around, thus the wonky numpad keyboard and subpar trackpad, as well as lack of drivers and support. it is what it is - cheap with good specs but disappointing execution, all of which can be forgiven when you consider the price. would i recommend this laptop? not really. I'd throw another $100-$200 and get a dell if I could go back. but it's not terrible. if you know cars, you know the toyota corolla is a solid vehicle. well, think of this as a geo prism, a corolla clone, rebadged and done up with a cheaper interior. but under the hood it's still a corolla.one last gripe - the friggin LEDs under the mouse buttons are bright as hell and completely useless. I covered mine up with some electrical tape.", "Date": "June 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "powerful laptop for good price", "Author": "Bilal Choudhry", "ReviewID": "R2Q27NB05OC07Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop from tigerdirect and i am very pleased with it. For under 400 dollars this thing is a beast. The dual core celeron is fast and it can be overclocked to around 3 ghz. The laptop is light and has good build quality too. I would recommend this laptop to any average consumer.", "Date": "December 20, 2009"}, {"Title": "Cheap make computer from Taiwan", "Author": "tram", "ReviewID": "R30IDJ0JXSABJM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was impressed of Taiwan brand like Asus because of the build quality. I thought of giving MSI a try since it s also make from Taiwan and it has a reputation for great motherboard. I bought this product less than 1 year ago but very unhappy about the quality of itBeside from the pro which is surprisingly cheap for a poor college student, there are tons of cons:I constantly have to restart because some internal problem . The build quality is cheap and the customer service will not do anything about it because they will blame on you for physical damage . My problem with this computer build quality is that the frame glue came off less than 1 year use. The lid have some problem with closing ( One side of the lid joint wont move) and plus, I have some hard time with keeping the lid open on it all at some angle ( and yes, within one year of use, no abuse, no dropping)I would advice not to purchase this product AT ALL, you dont want to mess with their customer service", "Date": "December 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Good Price, Excelent Performance", "Author": "H.

The only problem it's that the battery lasts only 2:30 hours of activity, but if you customize the power saver option, and decreese the processor level to a 50% of maximum, usage, the battery last up to 4 hours.With his celeron processor, give's an excelent option for internet and multimedia.And inlcudes webcam and microphone built in, so you can use skype, or other videoconference with an excelent performanceAn excelent computer, with a very low price,", "Date": "February 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS", "Author": "Dante Nicastro \"45 rpm'S\"", "ReviewID": "R90RL0OA4L8M3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "COMPUTER WORKS GREAT , FELL IN THE PRICE RANGE , DOES THE JOB FOR WHAT i AM USING FOR ..
