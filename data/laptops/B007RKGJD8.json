{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great 3D laptop.", "Author": "Ychen", "ReviewID": "RXGICF7SHQOYY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pro: A cheaper high end gaming laptop that's comparable to Alienware.  It has 3d function making your gaming experience much more in depth.  Screen is sharp and will not glare. Keyboard is crisp with a metallic gun finish.  Blue-ray player is always a nice addition along with the back lit key for working in the dark. Internal memory and hard drive is easy accessible for upgrade. 1.5 Tb harddrive is massive.Con: Some bugs with the sound system where the subwoofer doesn't turn off until the lowest decibel. The resting pad is changed into a foamy texture instead of the soft rubber texture from G74x. This version comes with only 12 Gb instead of 16 Gb, but you have an easy access slot for expand.  There are 2 hard drives but they are both partitioned giving you 4 smaller hard drives, not sure why they did that.  3D function is great but it turns down the screen resolution when in use and makes your backlit keyboard into a strobe light.  Kinda wish they had one of the hard drive for loading OS as SSD.Conclusion:  This is a great machine, you will like it if you can afford it.  The 3D function is the key here, so if you don't really care for that, go with the G75vw-DS72.  It is a faster computer for $100 less.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "Satisfied with this laptop!", "Author": "Dev", "ReviewID": "R32DPX4FKHJNT6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this laptop for almost 2 months (Bought in Aug 2012). So far it's been pretty solid. Everything works out of the box - no crashes so far.I bought this from Amazon. The box included the following:1. Laptop2. Laptop Bag3. 1 pair of Nvidia 3D vision glasses (3D vision emitter is built into the laptop). Glasses comes with a soft material pouch to store it in and keep it from getting dust. You may need a hard case to protect it if you want to travel with it in your bag!4. Manuals and driver CD5. Soft cloth to wipe laptop screen. 3D glasses also came with a cloth to keep it clean.6. Power adaptor - As other people have mentioned - this is pretty big. It also gets hot so be sure to place it in a safe spot where you won't touch it and keep it away from surfaces that might be damaged by heat.7. Gaming mouseAs mentioned by others, there are 2x 750 GB hard drives running at 7200 RPM. There are 4 partitions across these 2 hard drives. I was considering swapping out one of the hard drives with an SSD drive for booting and games but after using the laptop for the past 2 months I found that there doesn't seem to be any noticeable hard drive lag. I mostly play \"The Lord of the Rings Online\" and haven't experienced hard drive lag. My home PC definitely benefitted from an SSD upgrade but I'd say this laptop has performance comparable to my PC even with just the 7200 RPM hard drives in it.Others may get more mileage with an SSD upgrade depending on the games being played etc. For me, I'll hold off on an SSD upgrade since the laptop seems to be pretty fast as is!The laptop comes with 1 month of McAfee Internet Security (subscription automatically activated on first boot). After this expired I uninstalled it and I'm using Microsoft Security Essentials (free). You have the option to purchase an extension to the McAfee Internet Security subscription if you wish.Also of note:Don't forget to register your laptop online to ensure your warranty is put into effect! There's a card in the box with instructions to follow. I believe the laptop must be registered within a month of purchase - I don't recall the exact time frame at the moment.3D:I tested this with Mafia 2. The 3D experience was comparable to my home PC which is hooked up to a 40\" Samsung UN40C7000 3D TV. The PC has an Nvidia GTX470 video card and the TV has its own 3D glasses (no 3D vision as with the laptop). Mafia 2 on my PC and on the laptop is comparable. The 3D effect is more enjoyable on a large screen but there's no issue with the 3D on the laptop. Also, \"The Lord of the Rings Online\" came up in 3D at first launch without needing to be configured first. The 3D effect in this game is pretty impressive. I prefer to play it in 2D though since 3D is a little uncomfortable for long gaming periods. It's nice to switch to 3D in between to sight see. I also watched Tron 3D blue ray to test out the blu ray drive and 3D movies. This was good and confirmed that you can watch 3D movies with the included software.Overall - great laptop. Good performance, met all my expectations and runs my favourite game without issue.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "A good mix of power and affordability", "Author": "Chris Sutton", "ReviewID": "R2GJNC7YD8NAG4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So far, I've enjoyed my new RoG laptop to the fullest.  It has a great aesthetic, and doesn't skimp on performance.  The 1 Year Accidental Damage coverage is amazing as always.  The system comes with a pre-installed gadget that lets you switch from \"high performance\" to \"battery saving\", essentially throttling the proccesor and GPU to extend off-cable life.  The stereoscopic 3D on this model is quite good, though it wasn't my main reason for the purchase.  There are a few downsides, but nothing too terrible.  Like most gaming laptops, it is very large and heavy, has low battery life (about 2 1/2 hours), and gets hot quickly (ventilation is excellent, however, and I haven't noticed any performance issues related to heat).  The keyboard has a nice feel to it, but occasionally will not register a button press (I think this is a result of not pressing hard enough).  The partitioned hard drive is a bit odd (I found that using one for storage, one for Steam, and one for all other games worked well).  The system comes with the typical bloatware, easy to remove.  Overall, I am pleased with my purchase.", "Date": "July 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "If you like random Hangs, Freezes, and System lockups. Buy the G75VW-DS73-3D!", "Author": "--", "ReviewID": "R7AI0ASSXYP3Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Updated November 2012.I cannot recommend the G75VW-DS73-3D which is a pity as it's a nice looking machine when its working. In fairness to Asus after months of haggling they sent me a replacement G75 at their expense. But it has the exact same hangs freezes and system lockups! Is this coincidence? A bad batch perhaps? I don't know, so I'll leave it to the prospective buyer to decide.... Nvidia Driver updates do not fix the problem believe me I've tried, and Asus VIP support is the absolute worst!If you want to know what problems you might face with this laptop read this letter below to Asus that I sent after test driving a second G75 for a month. Incidentally, a common fault is that both G75's also had wrongly configured Atheros Ethernet slow upload speeds, making me think additional patch(s) weren't run at the time of the build. Either that or its an outright bad batch of G75's with bad 670m GPU's. Either way Asus have no solution. I will probably sell mine 2nd hand and buy a Samsung because I looked at the Samsung Series 7 and regret not buying it, as the Nvidia 675 appears more stable.If anyone has any questions about the G75 I can answer them in the comments section. For instance is the 3D worth it? In my view: NO! Playing for hours will almost certainly give you headaches as the 3D is not as comfortable as watching a 3D movie at the cinema. Basically the active shutter glasses approach causes strain on the eyes. Moreover the 3D means every game is darker, and even with brightness turned up within the game and in the power options, the clarity is not as good.Dear Asus,You misunderstand the problem. Please read carefully! I'm certain thesystem freezes are solely due to the buggy 670m GPU. How do I knowthis? Because the system can occasionally recover from a pendingcrash. When it can, it logs this message :-\"Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered.\"Most other times it fails to recover, and the system hangs which thenrequires a hard reboot. Either way the symptoms are always the same!But I'm sure you know this already from internal testing?! Or are yousaying that both of my G75's are part of a rare bad batch? I have afeeling that the Samsung Series 7 with the 675 is more stable andthat's why there are less complaints about it.To directly address your question though. I choose to rebuild the newG75 from scratch. The system image / Windows Easy Transfer optionsweren't that useful anyway. But so far on the new G75, I've onlyinstalled the basic programs. So I've held off installing lots ofgames and the game design software that I use, such as Unity 3D, UDKand Blender etc.Also note, the crashes mostly happen on the Desktop when merely usingExplorer, or Firefox with plug-ins / JavaScript disabled. Or runningIE with basic plug-ins enabled or just using MS Office. Please note thatfollowing on from Asus-ROG postings on G75 hangs, the new G75 has disabled :-A. all anti-virus software (uninstalled),B. all unneeded Services...C. all Scheduled Tasks...D. all registry RUN commands & updaters etc.", "Date": "June 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "didn't work", "Author": "Ddobrasil", "ReviewID": "R14VFDB7K4I68T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "got it turned it on, blue screen of death, had to run the maintenance utility to format it back to factory settings,once functioning it would constantly freeze, i would get the blue screens, sometimes it would stay stuck in a rebooting loop, nvidia video card driver would crash constantly, not a great experience for an asus product", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "horrible customer service from asus", "Author": "Imran", "ReviewID": "R1T7GNNFBRQUO2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "**update**i have sent the laptop for repair atleast 4 times now. now they finally claimed (after a year and a half) that the laptop is not repair-able and they would exchange it. think twice before buying anything from asus!!!.

After checking things out, I chose the Asus G75VW. I am pleased (understatement). It's made for gaming (though it could be used otherwise), so it's set up for that, and I don't have to do anything more than install games and play. It's fast, has a lot of storage, and amazing 3D. It's really heavy, it's not a lap-top, and they suggest not using it on your lap, so I have a tiny table to hold it while I'm gaming. Works great. The big screen is very wide, so even the widest-screen movies work well. When I want to watch movies nobody else wants to see, I use that with headphones.Over-all, my PC experience here is exhilarating. The hardware is extremely sturdy. The only negative is the disk drive tray seems just a tad flimsy, but then I've not really tested it.I suggested my wife get an Asus as a new business machine (far too heavy for air travel though), but her company bought her something else.

I'm impressed by the load times, I didn't think they would be anything special.

This leads to two problems; at first you'll be accidentally clicking things with the side of your palm while gaming, then after a while the sweat from your hand slowly builds up under the touchpad where it disables it. At some point you don't have to worry about it anymore because the part of the touchpad that your hand touches won't even work anymore. But still, poor design choice by ASUS. However since this is a gaming laptop most owners will be using a mouse rather than the touchpad so it's not a big deal imo.The keyboard is not as sensitive as I would like, it definitely takes getting used to. You have to press the keys kind of hard or they don't register, especially the spacebar, which causes some frustrating moments in games.When it's not plugged in there is a noticeable skipping when you play graphics-intensive games, it's like every 2 seconds or so the screen freezes for a half second. The gpu requires more power than the battery can provide.If you're a Starcraft 2 player you should know that there are occasional visual artifacts (which are fixed mid-game by a simple ctrl-alt-delete but it's still annoying). That's the only game I've had any problem with.Other thoughts:Really nice laptop overall. But in my opinion the 3D/120hz monitor are not worth the extra price, so unless you've already experienced 3D and really love it, you should just get the cheaper G75, and use the extra money for a SSD or keyboard or something.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Overall Machine.", "Author": "Brian Maier", "ReviewID": "R1P9AL2QP0NG5T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned my Asus for over a year (bought it just before Windows 8.0 became standard on all machines, wasn't jumping on that band wagon to #3!!).  So far, system performance has been great but I'll go over that in a second.  I spent several weeks looking and reading reviews for a new laptop before I came on this one and could not complain about the price for what the device comes with.  Big highlights I noticed and drew me in to this laptop was the: I7 processor, GeForce 670m graphics processor /w 3 GB dedicated graphics and full 3d setup, and the BD/DVD burner (major plus).  This system was to replace my desktop and had to have the power to be able to do VM Machines (for testing OSs and Software), capable of playing high-end games with max settings (or close to it) with decent FPS, a BD reader (why I said the BD/DVD Burner was a major plus), and mobility to go on the move (provided with the bag and everything, nice touch if you ask me).Now for the pros and cons (these are from what I\u2019ve seen and dealt with over the last year):Pros:- Full setup: Includes Carrying Bag, 3D Glasses, and decent gaming mouse (with modifiable DPI).- I7 Processor with minimum of 12 GBs of Ram: No real problems with slow-downs even with several VMs running (utilizing the processor utilization boosts this \uf04a)- BD Burner: capable of reading and burning Blu-ray DVDs is really nice.- 3D Ready: While the Nvidia Software can be annoying at times, it is ready and can be used for most games (not everything is compatible with 3D yet).  (For those who have issues of playing with 3D on all the time, I suggest you modify the Depth bar to a lower setting until you get used to it.)- Built-in 5.1 surround sound: Pretty nice while watching movies and playing games but a decent set of desktop speakers with provide depth that the small speakers the laptop includes can\u2019t.- USB 3.0 Ports: Quite fast when you can get your hands on USB 3.0 devices.Cons:- Video-playing software (Roxio CinePlayer) that came with the laptop hasn\u2019t been updated in the last year: While it can pay 3D movies, the newer Blu-rays aren\u2019t supported by this software and actually cause problems with the laptop interface with the BD/DVD drive.  Suggest owning or buying separate Video playing software.- Ram Placement: While half (2) of the ram is accessible on the bottom half of the motherboard, the other half of the ram slots are not accessible unless you take the entire laptop apart (which voids the warranty).- For those of you who like to lockdown your computers BIOS password interface doesn\u2019t accept special characters: While the BIOS password setup will accept special characters when inputting the password, the unlocking interface wouldn\u2019t accept the any special characters causing you to have to get your BIOS flashed.- Sound card Driver issues:-- If you leave anything plugged into the headphone jack and walk away, you\u2019ll find the sound comes out of both the speakers and the device coming out of the headphone jack.  Minor nescience but can cause some problems for users.  Adjusting the volume will cause the driver to fix this issue.-- The sound tends to come out of the subwoofer regardless of what was plugged into the headphone jack: I don\u2019t know if that is a driver issue or card issue and didn\u2019t notice anything until someone said something about it.  Went into sound driver and turned down the subwoofer to compensate.- Built-in Wireless card doesn\u2019t handle abuse: Heavy usage on the wireless card has actually caused it to become reliable for extended periods of time.Overall: Outside of its many problems, I still think it\u2019s a great laptop.  Some of the fixes are as easy as going a different way about things.  Example: For the wireless card issues, get an external one ($25-$50 fix).My experience: I\u2019ve been working with or on computers for over a decade in multiple different environments (mostly as system admin).
