The unit has never worked properly, continually crashing, reseting, and not connecting to WiFi. I have tried all available fixes, including searching online for help. I have installed updates, reset the device, restored the device to factory settings and nothing works. It continues to shut down and reset itself every few minutes, making it not usable. I finally resorted to returning it to Amazon, and found it past the return date, with no customer service to help make it right. I spent $250 on a big paper weight. I am dissapointed that Amazon wont help to replace a defective product.Update: I sent it back to Samsung and they refused to help. They claim my \" 3rd party charger\" (which I had to buy right after, because the Samsung one broke) CAUSED my problems... Nevermind that about 1 million other customers have the same problem. It's all over the Internet about the crashing problem... Do they all have \"3rd party chargers\" too? No. I bought Samsung instead of acer because I trusted Samsung. No more... They have lost me and everyone I can pass the word to as a customer.", "Date": "February 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "indispensable for mobile writers", "Author": "Satoru Isaka", "ReviewID": "R2AJH48GB1DCSC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First of all, I really appreciate all the reviewers who shared their experience.  Both positive and negative reviews provided great insights into an exciting new product with some unknowns.  I received the 3G version of Samsung Chromebook 11.6\" from Amazon a few days ago, and my experience so far has been very positive.  I'll focus on less-discussed topics, i.e. Language inputs, Verizon 3G, Bluetooth, USB ports, and useful Apps for Chromebook.Language - I write documents in English and Japanese, so the ability to input and switch between the two is very important to me.  I'm very pleased with Chrome OS in this regard for two reasons.  First, it's easy to add and configure multiple languages and input methods.  Go to Settings, add a language, and select input methods.  There appear to be more than 50 language options available.  Second, it's a one-click operation (press Shift-Alt) to switch between languages.  The Japanese fonts are limited at the moment, but for now, I'm very happy with this.Verizon 3G - Since this is a cloud device and my mobile workstation, the ability to connect both WLAN and WWAN is important to me.  I paid the extra $80 upfront (price difference between 3G and non-3G versions at Amazon) for the WWAN capability and 100MB/mo for 2 years included.  Activating the Verizon 3G was easy and took about 3 minutes.  I was connected immediately at a reasonable 2.4 Mbps download, 0.8 Mbps upload speed, measured by Speakeasy, San Francisco hub.  3G is not supposed to be used when I'm connected to both WiFi and 3G, so in theory I should be able to conserve my 100MB quota while I'm on Wifi.  However, as expected, 3G was used even when Wifi was available.  Wifi connection sometimes fails or takes a moment to connect/reconnect, especially waking from sleep mode.  When that happens, 3G mode kicks in immediately, eating into the allotted quota.  To avoid this, disable 3G while using Wifi, and enable 3G only when needed.  Enabling/disabling 3G or Wifi is a simple three-click operation.USB ports - I plugged in a USB mouse (MS 4000), and it worked without any noticeable delay.  That was actually a pleasant surprise because I'm used to the Windows behavior that normally takes a few moments of checking and installing drivers.  I did not see such delay in Chromebook, that's nice.  I also connected my USB drive (WD 300GB) and it worked fine.  A folder window popped up with all the content displayed.  Both USB and USB 3.0 ports worked just the same.Bluetooth - I tried my Bluetooth mouse (MS 5000).  Unlike USB mouse, I had to go into Settings and configure Bluetooth in order to make it work.  Chrome Settings is a one-stop shop for all configurations, so once you get used to it, it doesn't feel like a chore to make changes, unlike Windows . . .Once enabled and paired a device, the mouse worked fine.  However, whenever I turn off my BT mouse or put Chromebook in sleep mode, I have to wait for the mouse to reconnect, which takes about 5 seconds.  The USB mouse does not have such delay.  My understanding is that this Chromebook does not work with Bluetooth audio devices yet.Useful Apps for Chromebook - Over the past few years, I gradually transitioned from using MS Word/Excel/Powerpoint to OpenOffice Writer/Calc/Impress, and now to Google Docs/Sheets/Slides.  There are increasingly many useful apps, in particular I like LucidChart for diagramming, Pixlr Editor for image editing, and shiftEdit for coding in Perl, PHP, and Javascript.Chrome Remote Desktop is a very useful tool for Chromebook, works like VNC or pcAnywhere.  The response is fast, display is clear, it almost feels like I'm actually sitting in front of my main PC.  It was very nice to be able to access Quickbooks, Outlook, and local files that I did not upload, while sitting in a cafe.Speech Recognizer is a voice dictation app.  It makes use of Google Chrome Speech API, wrapped in a simple Google Search-like interface.  The Chromebook's built-in microphone works very well for me.  I tried both English (USA) and Japanese to dictate, and the recognition accuracy was excellent.As many of you discovered, the Chromebook is not for everyone.  But soon it will find its users and become indispensable for people like me.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for my needs", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2XZLYWDQ8IUQ1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Can't add much more technical details - plenty of people have covered it.  However, want to make clear to people considering this purchase: know what you are buying.  You cannot run Windows applications and if you need to, get something else.  Personally, I was already entrenched in the Google web apps - have used GDocs exclusively for a couple of years.  If you work on several devices, GDrive is the easiest ever.  My last netbook was an Asus.  I consider this along the lines of a netbook as it is lightweight and inexpensive. It has a perfect size for my older eyes in comparison to my netbook- it seems much bigger. It works great.  No, the screen is not the absolute best. No, it is not made of aluminum, but it feels as sturdy as any laptop/netbook I have owned.  For 250 bucks, this is looovely! I am very happy with this purchase.For teachers - you can run Power School by downloading an extension called RNDR. Download your gradebook.  Go to your downloads and click on the http link, not the download.  It will open the RNDR page and then the gradebook - it is a bit slower opening, but then works the same.  I'm sure there are other java apps that people need to use and this extension should work.  If there is one that you need to use a lot, google the name and chromebook and you can confirm if it works from posts.I want to reiterate- buy this expecting a netbook with a bigger screen and great form factor. This is not a cheap Mac, nothing like it.  You are not going to have popping images on this little laptop, but you can get work done and feel confident that if you lose it, it gets stolen or your kid drops it down the stairs, you are not going to lose all your work nor cry due to your loss.Have fun, everybody.Editing to say a few more things.  After using this for a couple of days, I like it more and more.  The keyboard is great. Took me a while to get use to the two finger scrolling on the track pad and was concerned about that, but now it feels normal.  Going between my Nexus 7 and this, I was a bit worried about the resolution and mat screen on this, but again that has proven to be no big deal - the mat screen is better for working in sunlight by far.  There is a slightly more yellow (not like yellow-yellow, just not that bright white of Nexus/tablets) to the screen that concerned me, but again, even that seems to make more sense for extended typing, etc - it is just not as bright/straining on your eyes.Also, the desktop sharing app works GREAT!  Full screen and I'm practically using my Ubuntu desktop on this thing.

That being said, the avg person should find that it performs everything they need outside of a few minor caveats; so here they are:Chrome OS is NOT for you if...1) You MUST use iTunes. If you have an iDevice and plan on using this to sync music, contacts, etc. It's simply not going to work. However if you only plan on listening to music and your library is on another machine you can use Google's Music uploader to add your songs to the Google Music web interface.2) You want to use this as your only computer with a printer that doesn't have Google Cloud Print support. If you have a PC or Mac on your network configuring Google Cloud Print is simple even with the oldest of computers.3) You must use Micro$oft Office and are not okay with either Google Docs or the new Office 365 web apps.Chrome OS IS for you if....1) You realize that there are modern web only alternatives for almost anything you would do on a PC.2) You want to use this as a secondary device that is more productive than a tablet.3) You want computer maintenance to be a thing of the past and want a device that \"just works\".Now I have read some of the negative reviews and seeing M$'s new Scroogled campaign let me clear up a few things:1) Netflix does work to a satisfactory level with minor performance issues. It helps to have all other tabs closed.2) This is a very thin and light plastic device with a VERY small power adapter. So if you abuse your electronics you might consider the HP Chromebook 11 (which has been pulled for now but I'm sure will reappear when they solve the heat issues with the power adapter)3) There are no added privacy issues over simply using the Chrome browser or Android. Other than logging on with a Google account there is nothing that says that you actually have to use their services. You can still use your favorite mail, calendar and even search engine.4) I have never had a crash (that I have noticed, it takes about 20 sec to restart and opens to the same tabs).In the interest of full disclosure I will say that there is the occasional task that I want to perform that cannot be done in Chrome OS, however there are multiple options to remote into my desktop in order to accomplish what I want to do. Chrome has a new easy to use remote access application that is very simple with the only downside being that it doesn't resize the display of the target device to match like RDP. Speaking of which, there is a native RDP app that works quite well, but usually requires being on the same network. Same goes for VNC. The last free alternative that I have used and it works quite well is LogMeIn.", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for the price", "Author": "S Lee", "ReviewID": "R3T8HSYJ3KU6PU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros-1. Fast boot up.  About 12 seconds when powered off.  About 1 second from sleep.2. Google Drive integration is fantastic.3. Setup took less than two minutes.  Core functionality built in right out of the box including office compatibility etc.4. Battery life is awesome.5. Design - Lightweight, great keyboard and touchpad.  While others have complained about the screen, I have no problems with it.Cons-1. Doesn't support Netflix2. Doesn't support Amazon Instant Video3. Out of the box native video support is limited.  You'll have to convert your videos to a supported format in order to play them from a flash drive.4. Application installations are limited to the chrome webstore (but I knew that ahead of time).Overall, I think this is a great purchase.  While there are some limitations, I believe this is a great price point for the hardware and included software.  This would be a perfect laptop for a student in college or high school considering that all office files are compatible using Google's Sheets, Slides, and Docs applications.  If your already in the Google world this is a no-brainer.11/14/12 Update - The latest Chrome OS update seems to have fixed the Amazon Instant Video issue.  I'm now able to stream from that service.

Power \"nlp trainer\"", "ReviewID": "RT6HEINYM1FS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I don't know if you're like me, but I have three desires. One, the protection of my data. Two, portability. Three, a smaller laptop type device with all the capabilities of a typical laptop.My previous computer crashed due to a defective hard drive, and I found myself taking the longest time before buying the Chromebook. I also wanted something better than a typical tablet. Make no mistake this is a tablet on steroids. It is not a pc, but it is close offering most of benefits of a pc, and in some respects offers considerable advatages.I bought it at a well known national retailer for about the same price as Amazon. What made me decide to buy this computer was the excellent advice given by someone from google who worked at the store.May I say that in terms of sophistication and ease of use it far exceeds a tablet device. I own a Nook, but I would not use it for buying an airline ticket, for example.The following made me decide to buy:100 gb of free storage for two years, offering considerable saving on online storage.Able after easy setup to walk out of the store with it working.The possibility of google cloud printing.The fact that you press a button and it's on, like a calculator.It updates automatically.It has in built antivirus protection, so you do not have to purchase software.You have the full benefit of the google technology, including drive.You have a wide range of apps available, particularly for document production, and its compatible with MS Office, and ODT.It also has pdf apps that are excellent, and you can easily convert a document into a pdf for easy printing..Other factors I liked after purchasing.It's light, compact, and easy to carry.It's very quick at connecting to new networks if you're roaming.It has great battery life about 6.5 hours, and this can vary depending on the nature of your usage.It even has an indicator which tells how much battery life is left.Google Drive offers you the opportunity to sign in and access your documents from anywhere.You can also create documents from anywhere, and even share documents online and allow other people to edit your document.Comparison to full pc laptop. For an extra $50 you can buy a laptop.On this computer you can do most but not all of what you can do on a regular computer. This is an absolutely excellent internet computing device. It's quick, and can process a lot of content, and you can have multiple windows open simultaneously without any noticeable slowdown. Unlike a regular PC it will never slow down.Automatic updates mean you never have to shut down it down like a regular pc to make updates.It does not have a cd player, so if cd burning is important, this is not for you. You can listen to your music collection on google cloud. I can easily listen to my amazon cloud music for example.It works with apps not with software. There are plenty of applications you can get at the google store many for free.I found that I cannot use Snagit on this computer to capture content. I use my pc for that.I love streaming movies on this machine. The pictures are crisp and vibrant, the sound excellent.I could watch a movie in bed without any of the awkward balancing you might have with a regular pc.Around the same time I bought this I also got a regular Dell PC. By comparison this is way faster to get going on. The Windows 8 apps on my new PC I found very annoying. They do not seem to work very well, and it's like running an obstacle course to get to a regular desktop setting.Although the google cloud printing was a major selling point, I went to another national retailer and bought an Epson 3520, which the salesperson assured me was cloud compatible. It's the most up to date. But when I attempted to integrate it with this machine it was not cloud compatible. So, if you do go for a cloud ready printer, research the makes and models before you go to the store, as salespeople do not always know.I like to Skype, so that was one of the considerations of getting the Chromebook which does not have skype. It does have calling and video calling capabilities called google talk, which I assume are comparable to skype.ExperienceI find that I love the Chromebook, and I tend to use it more than my two regular laptops, which I would be reluctant to take anywhere when I have this more compact, lightweight portable alternative. This is the number one seller in it's category on Amazon, and Samsung makes an excellent machine.As it's a Linux based operating system you will become acquainted with the Google Chrome browsing instead of window. The google drive you can access anywhere even from a different computer, and access your original bookmarks. I bookmark many sites, and I found the bookmarking somewhat preferable on the windows explorer browser.One of the ideas I love is the online storage, which means I could be in a different country yet still able to access 100 gb of content online, which offers considerable advantages over a tablet.I find this to be great hybrid between the tablet and laptop, and I highly recommend it.I think you will love it, and I hope this was helpful.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "A True Netbook", "Author": "matt kramer", "ReviewID": "R38C0F2NQMWYIV", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The chromebook is exactly what a netbook should have been.  It is basically a cheap device that lets you surf the internet with the convenience of a keyboard....nothing more and nothing less.  I actually prefer this to an ipad or any other tablet for two simple reason.  1) it is half the price of an ipad and 2) it has a physical keyboard.  By no means does the device feel cheap.  I would say you are getting far more quality than $250 worth.  The best way to describe the keyboard would be a that of a macbook air, but slightly cheaper feeling (more plastic).  The trackpad is also very good...better than 3/4 of the ones on current PC's.  I am use to using a mac, so you can change the trackpad to scroll similarly by going to trackpad settings in the chrome browser and choosing \"enable simple scrolling\".All in all this is a fantastic netbook. I would also like to note the apps are kind of useless b.c they are basically just bookmarks to the websites.  Battery life is a solid 7 hours, and the device runs smooth as butter.  The only thing I have noticed that is strange is the trackpad is god awful if you are charging the device and using it.  This may be fixed with an update, but the trackpad becomes very buggy.******updated*******After a little more time with the device, there are a few things I cannot get passed.  I previously mentioned the trackpad acting up when charging, and it seems like that is not the only thing.  The graphics become very glitchy and render the device unusable while charging.  Also, I have started to notice a very annoying flicker while using the browser, which is also a big deal since 100% of the time that is where my time is spent.  There is a strong possibility that my device is defective since I have not seen mention of these problems.  The flicker occurs when I move the mouse around and have chrome open, and it is mostly noticeable at the top of the screen.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Good Second Computer", "Author": "Macjoubert", "ReviewID": "R3P4OC5MFO4FZY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I received this a day back and am overall satisfied. Could have been better but I accept the product with its limitations and still see inherent value in its price point in recommending it, albeit to a different audience.First of all I had high hopes for this, I am tired of the Windows and Apple monopolies on OSes, I wanted something light, completely connected to the web as most of my needs are web based, hence the Chromebook.Likes: Ease of use, the thing is a little tiger, just trying and trying to provide you with different Use Cases for it.The keyboard though small, is ample to type on within 20 mins I was back to Windows level speed.The new keys are actually an improvement over regular Fn keys, I use them way more.Build quality is decent, I did notice that the screen can bend when pressure is applied, but the screen itself is nice and crisp.Music and video play well, there are native apps for them, pretty neat out of the box.Whole presentation is clear, and clean I like it.The laptop worked with my keyboard/mouse combo through USB but I didnt like not using the new keys so reverted back to the laptop keyboard.Free 100gb from Google, Im a cloud person, and have transferred all my documents to Google Drive and Skydrive, so this works seamlessly for me. Love it.ConsI was really hoping this would be a primary computer replacement, alas I doubt it:1) I cant connect to my monitor, I purchased a HDMI to DVI adapter and there is no output.Major annoyance(I know Google is working on a fix though, along with extended desktop)2) Citrix receiver doesnt work properly and the .ica files can't open, big annoyance.3) If it doesnt work on my current monitor I doubt it would work on the Apple display I planned on purchasing.Otherwise it's great, Im planning on buying 1 more for generic use around the house.If I find answers to my Con list i'll update the review, or if someone has answers please reply.Update1: I checked the HDMI output to a TV and another Monitor and it worked pretty well, so im guess it's a problem with my monitor.

Received it after about 10 days of wait.I love this machine as a pick-it-up-and-browse from anywhere in the house machine. I'm a heavy user of the google ecosystem, and that only adds to the usability of this little chromebook. For someone like me who uses a lot of web based products, or content (Google docs, Evernote, picasa, news sites, youtube, Google Maps, wikipedia, Wolfram Alpha...), all you need is a machine that has a good browser. And this one has the ultra-fast and nimble Chrome. Since I already use Chrome as the default browser from my Linux, Windows and Mac machines... and even from my Android phone, chromebook use feels like a very familiar environment.Tablets have their use, but for me, they are not ideal for extended news reading, or watching a video, for example. One has to hold them by hand. This chromebook can be set on a pillow, or on the lap comfortably. I'm writing this review from the chromebook, and I've been using this thing for the last 2 hours and it is barely warm to the touch.Redeeming 100gb of Google Drive space offer is simple. Just launch the google drive icon and you will be prompted to redeem the offer. Once you claim the 100gb, the next owner of the chromebook will not get the 100gb. Also, google claims that if you return the chromebook, the 100gb of space will be revoked.I easily changed the touchpad settings to mimic the MacBook air type swiping action. All my chrome bookmarks got imported into the chromebook right away.We have a MacBook Air at home, along with two windows based laptops and a few desktop machines.  I already am using this machine for all of my in-home mobile use.  This is a great sidekick for most of my non work related stuff.  However, I do use Microsoft Office apps for certain things, as also some multimedia software as a hobby. And for those, I still definitely need my dual monitor desktop, with all the extra pixels to enhance productivity. For all my research and work needs, a fully fledged laptop or a dual monitor desktop is indispensable; This chromebook just fills a different, but very important need and it does it admirably well.Looks good. Is sturdy to hold. Reasonable sound quality. Not a chromebook problem, but Spotify doesn't work on ChromeOS, since it is not a web/cloud based app.  Amazon cloud player works flawlessly... (even better sounding with headphones). No Netflix support yet on  this Chromebook, though I suspect that support will come soon.UPDATE Nov 4:After two days of use, I still have extremely positive feedback about this machine.  Outside my home office, this is now my goto machine. I'm barely using my tablets now.I quickly needed to figure out two things: CAPS Lock and Page Up and Page Down operations, since the keyboard does not have dedicated keys for these.  Instead of a CAPS lock key, the chromebook has a \"Search\" key at that location. To activate CAPS lock, one has to press <Alt><Search> keys. To deactivate, pressing either <Alt> or <Shift> keys will suffice. For Page Up/down actions, press <Alt><Up-arrow-key> or <Alt><Down-arrow-key>.Search for \"chromeos shortcuts\" on google, and one of the top pages will be a nicely laid out Google help page with a number of shortcuts.Another point of interest: Multiple usersBy default, Chromebook will allow anyone with a gmail address to login, though the very first gmail address that logs in will become the \"owner\".  Any user that logs in to the Chromebook, can use the Google offline storage drive. This will not conflict with other users.  Chromebook also allows a simple \"Guest login\".  Someone who logs into the chromebook can login as a guest using his or her google id. They can browse the net, check their email, etc, but will not be able to use their google drive in offline mode.Now, the \"owner\" can also limit which \"users\" are permitted to use the chromebook, by typing in a \"whitelist\" of google ids in a Settings field.  I setup my chromebook to allow my family members to login as regular users. This way, they can access their google drive space in offline mode as well.  Any visitors to our house who want to borrow the machine for a bit can login in the Guest mode.I tried Google Hangout yesterday. Works very well. There was one point where the person on the other send thought I muted my microphone, while I did not. We could not reproduce that scenario again. I also turned off my Wirelss router and tried to login to the chromebook. I was successful. I could access offline files, and modify them. I was also able to create an Google Doc in the offline mode.  Once I turned on my Wireless router, my offline changes immediately got synced to the Cloud Google drive storage. I checked this from another PC right after I switched on the WiFi router. All this is what I expected, but I wanted to make sure that it works that way. I'm happy it did.  This machine is going to be a keeper.Yes, the screen quality is not as awesome as that of the MacBook Air.  But, it is quite adequate for the purposes I mentioned and I'm really enjoying the experience so far.<Ctrl><Shift><L> quickly locks the screen if you need to leave your chromebook in a hurry. Any other user who chances upon the machine while locked has the option to \"Sign out\", unless they know your password (of course).

My tablet's accelerometer and gyroscope were getting frustratingly slow, my netbook was always slow, and I wanted something with a larger screen and attached keyboard; even though I have a Bluetooth keyboard for my tablet.  Since I am a proficient typist, I tried out the Samsung and the other company's $199 version and was very impressed with the Samsung's keyboard and over-all performance of the computer.  So here are my PROS and CONS:PROS- Fast bootup time and extremely fast from Sleep Mode.  When booting up or coming out of sleep, you will need to wait a few seconds to be connected with your WiFi -- then it's full-speed ahead.- The first time Set Up procedure took under five minutes to sync all my Chrome Browser, from my desktop, bookmarks, extensions, themes, etc. and Gmail contacts, messages, etc.  What a joy to be able to get down to using this new computer instantly.- Trackpad is a joy to use.  I did slow its speed down somewhat to make it less \"active.\"  The two finger movements need a little practice, but once you get use to it the functions are easy to maneuver.- My wireless mouse works perfectly with the Chromebook but I only used it once so far.  The trackpad is so easy to use that I have begun to prefer it -- possibly since I have been using my tablet for 1 1/2 years and there may be this touch transference.- I switched the Search Key to make it a CAPS lock key.  Glad there is this option.- Since I don't plan on doing any word processing, spreadsheets, photo editing, slideshows, etc. on the computer; my searching the internet, doing e-mails, streaming music and television episodes are flawless.- I find the viewing angle more than acceptable.  Sure it does \"wash out\" if you look too far up or down; but the screen's hinge is rugged and stays in place at the most desireable viewing angle.- Even though it is made of plastic and does have a very slight bend if you want to bend it, the computer is rugged and light-weight.  Going from an 8.9\" screen tablet to this 11.6\" computer does put a slight weight to the holding factor, but the computer is very well balance.- I am getting at least the advertised 6.5 hours of battery life.- There is no \"Save\" or \"Save As\" function when doing word processing (or at least I haven't found it); but everything is automatically saved in the Cloud on Google Drive.  That saves a few keystrokes.- Using CTRL-ALT-? is a great idea to see all the functions available with the keyboard when using key combinations.- The volume is more than adequate.  The speakers put out about three times more volume than my tablet.  Sure they are not part of a 2.1 stereo configuration, but they work well.  Using quality earbuds or over-the-ear earphones improves sound quality.CONS- Why is there a Search Key and a Search icon?  This is why I changed the key to a CAPS lock.  A minor annoyance.- Keyboard keys are not backlit.  I suppose that is to keep the cost and weight to a minimum.- No replaceable battery.  For $249 when the battery is depleated -- buy another Chromebook.- One final, minor annoyance:  Opening the Samsung Chromebook is a tight process.

I use my chromebook to view notes that professors post as well as to take notes of my own in google docs.  I also use it for web assignments and to browse the internet.  I have personally used multiple computers running windows as well as macbooks and this is by far the best computer I have had for these purposes so far.  Although it is not a very customizable/powerful computer it gets the job done for these purposes.  I can shut my computer down in between every class because the boot time for me is less than 7 seconds!  It took me about an hour to get used to google docs and after that I was in love with it.The computer is so fast and the hardware (keyboard, ports, touchpad, etc) are also excellent.  The touchpad is every bit as good as an apple touchpad and the keyboard is nearly there.

The first thing I took note of when using the chromebook for the first time was how easy it was to set it up and make it personal. There is a handy one screen guide to walk you through the process. It is all pretty straight forward and if you are a user of google chrome, you pretty much have it in the bag already.I set up the chromebook and downloaded the apps I would need to use offline and found the process simple and satisfying. Typing on the chromebook is pretty much the same as on any other keyboard with the noted exception that the keys have somewhat large spaces between them which can cause my typing to be a little awkward since I am used to my laptop where the keys are all close together.The screen has beautiful even illumination and the apps download very quickly.

I'm a little spoiled coming from a mechanical keyboard.TrackpadBig enough, quality enough, responsive and has good two finger scrolling. A little loud on clicks, but if that's an issue, you may just become a tapper and not a clicker.DisplayFrom reading the reviews I thought the display would be horrible.

I spend most of my computer time doing various word processing activities, and for that my very nice tablet is no reasonable substitute for a desktop computer. This Chromebook however, is perfect. It's inexpensive, lightweight, simple, and ready to use right out of the box.Because it's lightweight and doesn't get hot, it's very comfortable to sit with a Chromebook actually on your lap--something I haven't found to be true with other laptops. The plastic cover looks almost as good as the heavier casings on more expensive laptops, but it is easy to scratch so be careful. I'll review two aspects of the Chromebook--its functionality for word processing and its use as a back-and-forth to school computer for students.For word processing:  I hadn't used Google Docs much before I got the Chromebook, but it's a fine substitute for Word--the only thing I really  miss from Word is the ability to get synonyms with just a right click. I still use Word on my desktop computer, but since Google Docs can turn Word documents into Google Doc documents and visa versa it's possible to go back and forth between Word on my regular computer and Google Docs on my Chromebook very easily. I assumed I would end up wanting to get a bluetooth mouse, especially for the many times that I have to cut and paste while writing, but the trackpad is completely simple to use for this and for everything a mouse does so I haven't bothered. The keyboard keys are nicely spaced, not crowded. One thing I especially love about word processing on the Chromebook is that since it boots up and is ready to go so quickly I can grab a few minutes here and there to write--times that would be impractical on my desktop with its longer come to life time. Also with the Chromebook it's possible to write anywhere, including places without an internet connection since Google Docs can be used off-line.For students:  The students I see in my tutoring business have been very taken with the Chromebook, and after trying mine at least one of my students will be getting her own for Christmas. Her parents had been planning on getting her an iPad, but the Chromebook is both less expensive and more functional. Without buying any extra software students can research, write and print reports, essays or homework on it, and many of my students have already started using Google Docs instead of Word  because it allows for collaboration when they are doing group projects.  Most young people  are comfortable storing things in the cloud or moving things off and on flash drives so the small amount of storage isn't an issue for them , and the Chromebook's light weight is a real plus considering how heavy their backpacks can be. The Chrome Store has a lot of apps, always an enticement, and most of them free. Then there is the cool factor--the Chromebook looks good, and who doesn't appreciate that in an electronic device?I'm not ready to give up my desktop computer, with its large amount of storage and ability to add software, but as a second computer I could not be happier with my Chromebook.

I am a principal at a elementary school, and I purchased this to see what it was like, with a mind towards using it with a 1-to-1 initiative next year. My 8th grade son is very computer-literate, so I gave it to him to try out and report about. On the positive side, it seemed to work well while it worked, and he was able to produce pretty good materials with it. He enjoyed using it.However, several months after he received it, it failed. Specifically, overnight it developed a crack from one corner to another, under the glass, that rendered the device worthless. I looked for signs that it was dropped, abused, or something else, even though I didn't see it at home. There were none. To top it off, he had been storing it in the box it came in, for safety, and overnight, it was rendered worthless.No problem, I thought, I will just return it to Amazon. But they will not accept it, due to the several months having passed. OK, I thought, Samsung will do something. Not so. Any damage to the pixels under the screen is not under warranty, and will cost more than the device to repair. So I am out of luck here.When I google \"Samsung Chromebook cracked screen\" I get a whole bevy of hits, mostly inexplicable. When I spoke to an IT person who did computer repair, he just shrugged, but said he had seen/heard of the same problem.So, what did I resolve from this experience?1) Discourage everyone I know from purchasing a Samsung Chromebook due to structural unsoundness, unless it comes with an iron-clad replacement warranty. Even then, the time and effort to get a response from Samsung has pretty much soured me from purchasing anything they make ever again.2) Encourage people not to order this type of equipment from Amazon, since they state in their policy that your only recourse is talking to the manufacturer, and that failed in this case. Newegg or CDW, here I come!3) Keep my eyes open for the inevitable class-action lawsuit against Samsung, where I will end up getting a $13 gift certificate towards a future purchase of their materials, if I am lucky. :)4) Encourage anyone who is skeptical of my claims to look it up on Google before they purchase this product.5) Write my first review of anything on Amazon to inform those who might want to purchase it, to encourage just such a process.In a sense, the experiment worked. I have certainly gotten feedback on our expected purchase of Samsung Chromebooks for our school. So I am not ungrateful.

Intellisol, the company that is handling the repair, will label it as physical damage and tell you to deal with Samsung's customer service if you want to dispute it.

It is absolutely perfect for my needs. I'm not a \"tech geek\" or anything but I definitely appreciate being able to have a laptop which is extremely lightweight and so easy to bring with me just about everywhere. As a college student, this compact device is better than having a tablet as it is compatible with certain programs which the tablet I have is not. It is just as convenient, but more useful to me.I love how simple and quick everything is. Start up is within seconds, no loading screens, no nonsense. Log in and go. Also, shutting down is only seconds as well. My previous laptop had issues with shutdown and I couldn't close the screen until it was completely shut down or else it would interrupt the process. That usually took a few minutes. With the Chromebook, it's click, shut, and go. And shutting down rather than just closing saves battery life, even though that really is not an issue. While being used, it's currently calculating I have 90% battery left which adds up to 7 hours and 12 minutes. This is just great!With the exception of getting used to the placement of the keys on the keyboard (slightly different from a standard keyboard) I really enjoy how quiet typing is. I can sit and work on emails or papers in the library or at night without disturbing anyone because the keys aren't making a loud ticking noise as I am typing.Another feature, which was a huge selling point as I have had issues in the past, is the lack of fan and moving parts. It is very frustrating to have a laptop which can't be placed in your lap because it gets too hot. This laptop is always cool, which the exception of one spot which is barely lukewarm.Getting use to the smaller screen and type was an adjustment at first, but there is a setting feature which allows you to enlarge the type on a page without having to zoom into the screen which I like.Essentially, the Chromebook is great! It takes a little bit of getting used to but the adjustment only takes a short time. I'm sure there are some other things I haven't discovered and I haven't had a chance to get a good look through all of the apps available. The only small complaint that I have is the inability to stream on Netflix. I guess it's not compatible with the OS yet but they're working on it. But it's only a small complaint because I can use my tablet to watch Netflix and in that case I'm able to work on the laptop while watching movies and shows considering both of them are small and don't take up too much space.Overall, I am very happy with my new \"toy.\" I've been bringing it with me everywhere I go!**UPDATE**Should have done this sooner. Unfortunately I had to drop my rating on this product only because within a few months I was no longer able to use it. Due to one fall from a counter top to a carpeted floor, my power adapter apparently suffered some unseen damage. (It landed flat on the bottom as it slid off the counter.) This caused the area around the adapter port to somehow overheat and melt. The damage was not immediately obvious to me and the next time I went to unplug my computer, the tiny metal piece snapped off inside the port itself. Because this was caused by a drop and I sadly had not purchased the extra warranty which covers drops, there was nothing I could do. I've considered purchasing another Chromebook, but with the adapter being so fragile, along with the strange sort of malfunction, I'm not sure I want to take that risk.

However, if what you need to do is limited to working in a web browser and you want a high-value computer (inexpensive), these are superb for a number of reasons:  - On a windows/mac laptop if you lose it you're almost certainly losing some data/customization.  With a chromebook you can buy a new one, login and you're back to normal.  You could easily mix up your and your kid's chromebook and not notice with the exception of stickers.  - You need not manage software.  I'm a software engineer and it drives me nuts having to apply updates and patches and troubleshoot why I can't delete files in windows, etc.  These problems are just not there on a chromebook.  - Guest computer.  Not something I thought I'd care about, but it's really nice to be able to hand this to someone visiting.  It's on your network and they can login with their own account or use the guest mode.  A friend of mine was really amazed when his various chrome plugins and bookmarks appeared.On the downside:  - Chromebooks are not extremely fast.  However, the battery life is excellent and it's quite inexpensive which make up for it.  Perhaps if they are popular enough faster versions will emerge.  I have no problem playing YouTube in full screen, but compared to my primary computer (a high eng macbook pro; over 10x the price) it feels somewhat sluggish.  - There are specific things you expect a computer to do which won't work, or which will need some special hardware or effort.  For example:  - Printing.  You _can_ print, but will need a \"cloud-ready\" printer which you probably don't have OR will need to print via another computer which has cloud-print software setup.  - Legacy software.  You can't use any software that you'd install from media.  Basically anything that this computer will do needs to be in the operating system (chromeos, which will improve over time), or software which is implemented as a web application.  The capabilities of this kind of software is improving as well but you're not going to be able to run things like quicken, word, photoshop, etc.  You can likely find web-variants of this kind of software but it will be different and likely more limited than what you're used to -- at least for awhile.I've also owned an earlier Chromebook, the cr-48 and while the \"matte black\" finish of that unit had it's charm, the Samsung is superior in every way that matters.In summary: If you understand the limitations and benefits of this model you'll be extremely pleased with ChromeOS and the Samsung chromebook.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for a Student and Light Use", "Author": "J.M.", "ReviewID": "R2D41NBO94GSNG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Wow.

You don't know how excited that makes me.The Chromebook is light weight and tiny. You barely feel it's there in your bag. I've gotten many complements on how cute it is. I've read about some people being unhappy with the quality of the screen. I honestly don't notice it at all. It's matte, which I actually prefer. When going back to my laptop, it takes some time to get used to the glossy glare of a normal screen. If I wanted to watch an HD movie, I'd look into buying a TV. It plays Netflix very well.Browsing the web is quick and easy. It has a HDMI port. Also has two USB ports, so the storage isn't lacking. I keep everything on Google Drive and then when I know I won't be working on it again, transfer it to my laptop or USB.Don't kid yourself. For $250 you aren't getting a state of the art computer, but you certainly do get more than you paid for. It's a functional, easy, simple, and, most importantly, productive piece of technology. I'm not worried for it to get a little banged up with the normal wear and tear of bringing it around because of the price. It's definitely priced to be used functionally!Would recommend to a student or someone who wants something for browsing.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Chromebook - the GREAT and errr, not so great", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RH6NJOEKIWBQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First, I am a huge fan of the Chromebooks and had one of the last generation from my work.  I bought the $250 Chromebook about two months ago as a personal laptop and have been very happy with it.First thing to know, THIS IS NOT A REGULAR LAPTOP.  You don't download and run programs like you do with Windows or Macs.  Imagine everything you do in your web browser like mail, Google Docs, Facebook, Netflix, Hulu, web browser games, etc. Please make sure you understand what this laptop is and does.  I use it for school and only the thing that didn't work for me was MiniTab, a statistical program which only runs on windows.If you had an older version of a Chromebook, this is much lighter and thinner!  I consider it a perfect travel laptop and have taken it on a couple of trips already.  There is a trade-off between battery life and CPU speed, because the Samsung 5 was slower (to the point of being a negative) but the battery life was 9+ hours - really.  I downloaded movie AVIs and literally watched movies for a 6 hour flight.  So, overall I am happy with the trade-off and like the beefier CPU with 6 hours of battery.  The extra USB port is good as I like to have a wireless mouse and sometimes put in a USB key.Security wise, you can not ask for a better laptop.  All code is signed and downloaded from Google.  You can not add software unless you put it in developer mode, which you can clearly see warnings to avoid confusion.  No malware can exist and Google has hacking bake-offs to find and pay information security researchers.Overall, the 'Poor Mans MacBook Air' is a total winner at $250.  Really: no virus, patching, reloading stuff, and the typical computer things you have to do.  Patches apply automatically and since everything is stored in the cloud, you can wipe it and be working in minutes.Last thing, if you need PC remote control - there is a Chrome Remote from Google.

I have/had the first Samsung chromebook, Chromebox, 550, and now just received the new $249 Chromebook today.For $249 it is a steal. Great looks (80% of a Macbook Air). I wanted to focus this review to give insight to people already using other chromebooks.1) Screen - The screen is nothing like the first 2 versions from Samsung. This is a cheaper screen that is very noticeable side by side. Many others mention about the viewing angle losing brightness, I agree. I also have a cloudy into (almost the wrong hue) on my screen. Very similar to my first notebook in 1998. Samsung, if you have a better option -please use it. This is the most glaring thing versus the 550.2) Design - LOVE IT! After comparing the two, I want the screen of the 550 pushed into the form factor of this new one. Measurably more thin without the rounded plastic feel that has dogged the first two Samsung chromebooks.3) Sound - It is like going back to the original Samsung chromebook. Almost half the volume of the 550. Ok, but don't expect the volume.4) Speed - Do not notice issues here.In summary, I would love if they made an option for $50-$100 more with a 12.5\" - 13\" higher quality screen (seems like enough room, as there is a large bezel around this new one). Also wished they would upgrade the speakers and volume. Put these two things into the current size and design and you have a STRONG business/higher end machine (for $299-$349, no more $449 chromebooks please as it defeats the purpose). That said, this is a great value for what it is and I strongly feel every house should have this laying around (you will use it more then a tablet). I just wish they had a higher quality machine like the 550 in this design (at a lower price point).", "Date": "November 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "The Chromebook's time has come!", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R240ULNXGWT91V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "While I was always a fan of the Chromebook concept of an easy-to-use, virus free, and quick-to-start laptop via which you interacted only with web sites (which most of us do most of the time), Google pitched it wrong at first by making the darned things more expensive than PC laptops that could do much more for no more money. Potential users who avoided Chromebooks for this reason were missing the point, but still they stayed away.With the launch of the new model Chromebook as well as the earlier Chromebox, and with some recent changes to the Chrome OS, I think that the Chromebook's time may finally have come. This is because several things have happened since the first Chromebooks were launched in 2011:* The Chrome OS has been given a \"desktop\" style interface, which makes it more \"familiar\" to traditional PC users.* The ability to use the Chromebook off-line (not connected to the Internet) to edit documents and to play media files from a USB stick or SD card (or from your Downloads folder) has been improved.* Windows / Intel \"ultrabooks\" have come on the market; which has played into Google's hands by raising the price that users expect to pay for a sleek, fast start-up \"netbook\"... thus making Chromebooks now look more reasonably priced.* The new October 2012 Chromebook is in any case much more reasonably priced, it looks nice, and it performs well.* Finally, with the plethora of touchscheen tablets and the introduction of Windows 8, the Chromebook may have found a niche by sticking with the more traditional keyboard + touchpad + screen format.You don't get a manual with your new Chromebook (or with any computer these days) but The Chrome Book (Second Edition) was published to coincide with the new model Chromebook.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Surfing", "Author": "P.

I mean, what were you expecting from computer this price?So the reason why I rated 4 stars, is because it does what I want to do, but lacks a bit. I am a student, that types reports, essays, does charts and whatnot. Surfing the internet, Facebook, YouTube. It does everything I want it to do in this laptop. Long battery life, cool.The reason why I took one star of was because of the printing and the way it stores files. Printer doesn't work. Well, for your average printer that doesn't need wifi-the classic ones-it doesn't. It needs wifi to register. I'd consider checking what printers work on Chromebooks and checking if your printer matches. It wasn't too much of a bother with me because I have a computer, and I could just print it out over the Google Drive. Another thing is the files. The files such as Google Docs or Spreadsheet, they are online files that are stored in Google Drive. What this means is: You can't access your files unless you have it in your Flash Drive. Because this doesn't have hard drive-which can be a pro because that's what allows it to be slim. You could still make filles, and they automatically go to your Google drive once you have wifi.Bottom Line: If you aren't planning for a internet file downloading, and just typing and surfing the web, this is for you.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "I CAN'T PRINT!!!", "Author": "Fancy-pntz", "ReviewID": "R2BK4CLDAMVT34", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I was so excited about the Chromebook.

All the other times I printed from school, anyways what I found out is that I can't use a classic printer to print from here. Meaning I CANNOT plug a printer on to here and print.

First of all, when I first took it out of the box and booted it up for the first time, it was really buggy, the touchpad was wonky, things loaded very slowly, and it was just really bad. However after I shut it down and rebooted it (all of which took only 15 seconds by the way, which is fantastic), I was told that Chrome was now downloading a \"critical update.\" After this, things have just been amazing. This really is a testament to how far and fast Chrome has and can improve. Plus, there's an update for Chrome every ~6 weeks which just makes things absolutely amazing.  KEYBOARD: in a word, amazing. The island- style chiclet keys have great travel and feedback, are extremely comfortable and easy to type on, and within the first 30 minutes of using the Chromebook I was typing error free and at my usual speed. The keyboard is probably one of the best features of this laptop. There's also function keys up top that control brightness, volume, and various other things, which is really handy.  TRACKPAD: I love this. It feels great and works just like the trackpad on higher-end machines. Two-finger scrolling works great, and while there is the occasional hiccup where it doesn't register the second finger, it's a very minor thing and doesn't happen often. There's also three/four finger gestures that allow you to navigate between different tabs if you swipe left/right on the trackpad with three/four fingers. And as expected, there's tap-to-click as well as standard press-trackpad-to-click. My only wish is that Google/Samsung would add pinch-to-zoom gesture on the trackpad.  BATTERY: in addition to the keyboard, this is one of the shining features of the Chromebook. As a test, I used it today from 12:45 PM nonstop until 6:10 PM, browsing, reading, and watching tv shows. I bet if I didn't stream any video it could've lasted even longer. There's no question whether or not this will last a full day of work/school- it definitely will. And if you're working offline, maybe on the train or on the bus, it'll probably last even longer. The battery is wonderful- one of the reasons why I chose the Samsung Chromebook over the Acer C7 version, which has an estimated battery life of only 3 hours.  SCREEN: very standard. It definitely is usable, sure, but it's not going to blow your socks off with colors, resolution, or anything like that. It gets the job done, and the matte finish helps it with glare, but the brightness has to be set at about 75-80% brightness to view comfortably.  CHROME OS: a mixed bag. If you're comfortable with Chrome already and already use Google's vast suite of online products (i.e Gmail, Youtube, Maps, Drive, Search, Translate etc) you'll have no problem with it. However, if you depend on desktop programs such as Photoshop, CAD, offline MS Office (there's SkyDrive which is basically MS's online word processing program- sort of like what Google's Drive does), you'll either have to find basic replacements from the Chrome Web Store, or simply make do without them. Not only that, once you're offline your Chromebook's functionality is severely limited. You can still edit and create documents and such on (offline enabled) Drive, and view and compose new emails on the Offline Gmail app, and some other things if you find the right app for it, but mostly, there isn't much you can do once you're out of range of a WiFi hotspot. If you plan on using this at home 24/7 however, this shouldn't be a problem.  BUILD QUALITY: not very good. While the plastic is solid and feels sturdy enough, it's very easily scratched, so it's best to purchase a sleeve or case of some sort to keep it safe whenever you're not using it. In fact, it's so easily scratched, I've already found three or four scuffs and scratches on the top and bottom even though I've literally carried it around on a pillow, and used it on top of the foam that came in the packaging. Very unpleasant. But for the price, I guess that's a tradeoff you'll have to live with.  WRAPUP: I'm very pleased with this. It works like I expected, has great battery life and keyboard quality, and although the screen isn't that good, and the build quality is less than stellar, they're two things I'll just have to live with. Just know what you're buying, folks. This isn't an ultrabook nor is it even a standard laptop. It's a Chromebook, and if you buy this expecting to GET a Chromebook, you'll be quite happy. Don't buy this expecting the same functionality of a full-blown Windows or OSX machine, because you will be disappointed. For it's purpose, it's a great device.  However, I have recently come across some complaints online about the screen spontaneously breaking on its own without even being touched or dropped or damaged in the least. I have no idea what might cause this, and my Chromebook seems to have no problem so far, but I really hope those are isolated occurrences.  I'll update this review as time passes if anything comes up, or if my views change, but until then feel free to leave any questions you guys might have. I'll try to help the best I can!-------------------UPDATE 1:  I recently bought a case for my Chromebook- it's called the iPearl mCover case. It's a snap-on plastic shell for the top and bottom, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to protect their Chromebook. This laptop on its own feels very thin and flimsy, but now it's much more solid with the case on it. I've also written a review on the case on the product listing here: iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6\" Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi or 3G) laptop - CLEAR (and for anyone wondering, I am not advertising for this company. This is my honest experience with their product).-------------------UPDATE 2:  After using the Chromebook for multiple months, I can safely say that this is a great computer who does the majority of their work online. The battery life continues to be great, with 5-6 hours of continuous use (or about 3 when streaming video). One complaint I have is how the Chromebook ships with a proprietary charger (micro-USB port like the HP Chromebook 11 would have been far more handy and convenient). The keyboard keys and trackpad feel as responsive and clicky as ever as well, and everything in general has been great even after extended use. I have not experienced the 'spontaneous screen crack' that other people have been victims of, for which I am very glad. It seems those issues really are only limited to earlier models, and that the build quality issues have been ironed out.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is not a laptop", "Author": "Jeff Sauri", "ReviewID": "RYF363DZM43HI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you can wrap your mind around the fact that this is not a laptop, and if you are invested in the Google ecosystem, you will love this device.

If you dont use gmail, and have never heard of google docs and the cloud is something that rain comes out of, then the chromebook may not be for you.After repeatedly checking package tracking on Amazon, the status on my Chromebook order finally changed to \"Shipped\" and I called my town's post office to confirm it was indeed there. The guy running the place was amazed i knew it was there, since he had not done any final scans on his boxes. Needless to say, i rushed home and got ready to open my new Chromebook.Due to noisy and nosy kids i won't be able to do the google hangout like i wanted to, so a good written review will have to do.The Samsung 303C12 Chromebook (MSRP $249.99)Unboxing: Nothing spectacular. Multi-language quick start guide, some safety precaution stuff, basically nothing to read. ONE THING THAT DID KIND OF UPSET ME..NO CHROME STICKER! I have watched a few unboxings on youtube and everyone got a cool chrome logo sticker. Slightly bummed out.Comes with a pretty small (in comparison to other laptops) AC power supply with a fairly long cord.Looks and feel: Picking it up for the first time, i knew right away that the claims of it being lightweight and portable were true. I'd say it weighs about half as much as my CR-48. I could see myself carrying this around a lot, it is uber light. Very slim and smooth lines. The majority of the ports are along the back edge, with the exception of the headphone jack and the SD card slot, which are up on the upper left hand side. I didn't feel any flimsiness about it at all. The only \"blemish\" i have about the case is the rounded hinge on the lid. The look Samsung was going for here was the Macbook Air, it is pretty obvious that this is a clone of that when it comes to styling. The keyboard is a dream to type on, even better than the CR-48. The key buttons remind me a lot of a macbook. It has the chrome keys along the top replacing the traditional F1-F10 keys and the CAPS LOCK key is replaced by a search key.Actual use: First boot up was quick and fast, just have to select some geographic things and then point it to your wireless connection. Then you log in with your Google ID and it goes to the desktop. Earlier versions of ChromeOS didnt have the desktop, but now youre presented with a nice background picture and icons on the bottom right and a clock on the bottom right along with wifi gauge and battery life indicator. Very windows like in that regard.But one thing for sure, you would have to be a big believer in google services such as gmail, docs, calendar, maps, picasa and others to get full use out of a chromebook. I am making the transition to nothing but chromebooks in my house and so far everyone is getting things done with few complaints.Performance wise it works quite well, there is no fan, it doesnt get hot and renders webpages well. I havent had any issues with youtube, netflix, hulu, or any other streaming media site. Flash and PDF viewer is built in, so there is no need to go hunt down plugins from adobe.Your portal for additional apps is the chrome web store, with just about everything you need there. Word is out that this is going to get a makeover soon and look more along the lines of the Google play store for android devices.The chromebook does have a webcam, while not a HD cam it will do the job for just talking to others. Skype is not supported so face to face networking is handled by using Google+ Hangouts. Adding people is as simple as getting their gmail from them. And hangouts has the ability to video chat with up to 9 people at once.Battery life is stated at 6 and a half hours and depending on use, it will get that easily. Probably a little less if youre doing nothing on it but watching Netflix.The screen is a matte finish to reduce glare and looks very nice. I have no issues with at all with it.The touchpad...well what can i say about this...im a longtime desktop computer user and i dislike touchpads of any sort. The first thing i did was plug in my wireless mouse so i didnt have to use it. But it is usable, and from all reports works very well, and the tracking speed can be adjusted in settings.All in all, this is a great device.

I loved it, so I ordered one of my own. It's wonderful. Easy to use, great keyboard, fast. It was perfect for my needs. I couldn't find anything I didn't like about it. . . EXCEPT it wouldn't hold the wifi connection at home. I could use it for 10-15 minutes and then it would lose the connection and just try over and over to reconnect. When it did finally reconnect, it would be for only a few seconds or minutes. I visited the most popular Chromebook users groups and found that this is a common problem. The Chromebook doeesn't hold the signals from some routers, apparently.  It gets a little murky about exactly what causes it. There were all sorts of suggestions about how to handle the problem--reset this, disable that, get closer to the router, etc.--but I'm not tech savvy, and no one could say what the solution definitely was. I called Cisco, the maker of the router I own, to get help with some of the suggestions and perhaps get to the root of the problem. They would have been happy to help me for the low, low price of $200. I tried two other Samsung Chromebooks at home without success, so I believe it is something to do with my network.

This is unfortunate as while Chrome OS certainly has several limitations compared to more traditional computing setups, what it is capable of doing, it does very well.I went with this Samsung rendition of the Chromebook over the competing (and cheaper) Acer edition primarily because of the 16 GB solid state drive that Samsung included.  The Acer machine might be more spacious but you'll find that you have little use for all of that space on a machine that is built entirely on accessing the Cloud (and, frankly, the numerous services that Google offers).  If ultra-fast boot times and complete silence from the machine are both things that you are looking for, then this little Samsung with its 16 GB SSD delivers.  I timed the initial boot at a brisk 28 seconds and the only hiccup from unpacking to browsing the internet came when I was accessing my Google credentials.  I've had problems with my Google password in the past so I use 2-step verification.  For those unfamiliar with Google's security services this involves Google sending a text message to my cell phone in order to authenticate my identity.  Once I had my code and was signed in, Google synced up all my data instantly.After a few minutes of clicking through a brief tutorial \"app\" that Google includes to help bring people up to speed with their new computer (and the different way that Chrome OS handles some things) I was happily browsing the internet.  My first stop on the Cloud? Amazon MP3 to pull up all my music and get some Journey playing while I checked out the rest of my new computer.  Most Chrome users are probably going to be interested in Google services like Google Music but I was very happy that a third party web \"app\" like Amazon MP3 worked without a hitch.  Like many people, I don't do everything through Google so it is good to know that Chrome OS is diverse.  Anything you can do in your traditional PC's Chrome browser, you'll find you should be able to do within Chrome OS (essentially a glorified version of Chrome).Build quality on the machine is pretty impressive for a laptop that costs less than $300.  Some reviews I've seen have complained about the poor quality of the plastic and while it won't win any awards, especially if you set it next to a Macbook, it manages to look stylish and feels firm enough.  The entire machine only ways around two pounds and everything about it is sleek.  The keyboard is a particularly bright spot with spacious, spread out keys, that look more at home on an iProduct than a cheap, low-end computer.  In fact, I can guarantee that the excellent quality of the keyboard's build has led to this review being needlessly wordy.I threw several different websites at the computer including Amazon MP3, Youtube, NBC News, and a few hobby pages that I go to and Chrome was able to render them with a snap.  After spending close to a year on my smartphone and Nexus 7, I forgot what it was like to browse the web in its full glory and if website use is your primary goal, you'll be very happy with how snappy Chrome OS makes the internet run.  Even with seven tabs open, I'm till running smoothly.  I was also pleased to discover that the audio quality on the machine's internal speakers is fairly decent though I did pick up some background noise.The Chromebook obviously isn't for everyone: it needs the internet to function and if you live in a rural area with spotty internet connection and poor access to wi-fi networks, the Chromebook is sure to disappoint.  If you are seriously considering this machine (or any Chromebook for that matter) you need to ask yourself how much of what you do on a computer involves the internet.

After one week of constant use, I am very pleased with my purchase. I would like to begin by saying that my \"main\" computer is a 15.5\" Sony Vaio that dual-boots Ubuntu and LinuxMint. I am a student and was looking for something that would be a more portable as I run back and forth from home to university. I browsed the latest laptops at Best Buy and was not ready to commit to funding any of the new models I saw. Then, I came across the Chromebook section and decided $249 was a perfect price and it appeared that the machine had all the basic requirements I would need. To my great disappointment, Best Buy was sold out so I immediately came home and ordered one from amazon.Who Should Buy a Chromebook?Anyone who wants a more portable laptop and only needs a computer for writing documents, browsing the web or watching videos should really consider a Chromebook. Also, any first-time laptop owners who just want to do simple tasks would benefit from having a Chromebook because they are so easy to use and you do not have to worry about licences, updates or viruses. If you need specific software or play a lot of games, the Chromebook would not be a good replacement.What I Like:Set-up - Setting up a Chromebook is the easiest set up I have every gone through. If you have a google account, all you do is login using that information, select your wi-fi network and time zone and everything is ready for you. If you use the Chrome web browser, all of your tabs are synced.Size - 11.6\" seems so small compared to my 15.5\" laptop, but the Chromebook's size makes it easily portable. The screen size has only been an issue on a few select website where I needed to adjust the page view, but otherwise I feel I adjusted very well to the smaller size.Keyboard - The Chromebook's keyboard is one of its best features. I love typing on this little machine. The size of the keys and the space between the keys is perfect. Instead of function keys above the numbers, the Chromebook has smart keys to better navigate the Chrome browser. Also, screen and volume adjustment keys are in this same row, making controlling your machine a lot easier than trying to remember which function key does what. There is no page up or down keys, but a series of keyboard shortcuts found on the Chromebook's website will show you how to achieve those tasks.Trackpad - I love the larger trackpad, so much more intuitive and useful than the standard PC trackpads. I have noticed this style is catching on in other PC brands (thanks Apple).Solid State Drive - One of the main reasons I chose the Samsung Chromebook over the Acer Chromebook, other than aesthetics, was the SSD. Although only 16GB, with Google Drive's 100GB cloud storage, I have plenty of room for my files and pictures. When I am using the Chromebook, several tabs open and typing away, I am still surprised how the machine makes NO noise. The casing never gets hot, I have noticed it becomes warm while in use, but that is to be expected and is not a distraction. The fast and soundless SSD leads me to my following point . . .Battery Life - This is the best feature of the Chromebook. I have clocked in over 6 hours of battery life before charging. I have yet to run the battery down lower than 25% because I never need to! The simplicity of the operating system (Chrome OS) and the fact that the traditional hard drive with moving parts has been replaced by a flash drive absolutely contributes to the Chromebook's lasting battery life. Of course, when I am on batter power, I turn the brightness down. I no longer even bother bringing the power cord with me to school since I can get plenty of work done between charges.Things I'm Getting Used To . . .I was an early adopter to the Chrome web browser because it was always the fastest on the operating systems I used. With that said, I would consider myself very familiar with how to use the Chrome features. However, using Chrome OS was an adjustment for me, because it was different than what I was used to. Not worse or harder, just different. I had to get used to using Google Drive instead of Dropbox and using Google Docs instead of LibreOffice or MS Word. Also, I still have my other laptop that I needed to figure out how to sync with my new Chromebook to make switching between machines seamless. After a few days, I was able to figure out a system that worked for me.Also, the Chromebook doesn't give you a lot of control over how your desktop looks. Yes you can change the background image and arrange the apps however you like, you can even choose to have the dock disappear. Other than that, very little is left to the user to configure. I believe this is intentional to make using the Chromebook the easiest experience for the majority of users.Although it has not been an issue yet, I would like to mention that I wish that the memory was 4GB instead of 2GG mostly for longevity reasons. I will have to update this review if that becomes an apparent issue in the future.To summarize, I love the Chromebook and it certainly makes a very good laptop replacement, for now. It works great for my needs and since I am always around wi-fi. Also, this laptop is beautiful. Looks aren't everything, but beautiful things sure are inspiring.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Web Appliance - That's what it is!", "Author": "Kent Vaughn", "ReviewID": "RZ5TMIMDGVZK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not going to go into great detail about the Samsung 11.6\" Chromebook in this review.  I've read many of the reviews and I can say that there are others that have covered this is great detail already.  But I'll throw in my viewpoint on a few items.  First, as most have indicated - This isn't a Windows PC, so if that is what you are looking to purchase (or replace), then most likely you'll find a few critical elements missing (oh, such as being able to install Windows Software) that will be a deal breaker.  It is absolutely critical that purchasers of this device understand what it is and what it isn't.So what is it?  I like to call it a Web Appliance, because that's where it excels.  It's a small computer with keyboard that gets you access to the Internet & Cloud based computing.  So can you only use it for Web browsing?  No, it can be much more than that if you are willing to move away from the Windows PC paradigm of computing and consider Apps, in particular Google Apps/Docs to do your work.  If you are, then this little machine can cover (almost all) web browsing needs, (light) word processing, presentation and spreadsheet work.  But you'll be using Google Docs for that effort which isn't MS Office, but for most work is sufficient.Another sweet spot for me is the simple fact that I have had it with Windows PC, as powerful and capable as they can be, they are optimal for about 6 months.. then the SW hogs takeover and within a year or two your machine is dreadfully slow and needs a full re-format and reinstall of Windows.  Then the cycle starts over.  BTW, I'm a PC guy - I've only ever had MS Windows PC and still figure I need at least one functioning Windows PC in the house.  I use Adobe products (Lightroom / Photoshop) and to do that I still need a full functioning Mac or PC.  So devices like the Chromebook don't fully replace those, but sure simplify keeping a family of 6 up and running with basic computing needs and internet access.  And moving to Cloud computing and document storage simplify data access and backup.Negatives:  I'm not concerned about things the chromebook never claimed to do.  But there are some features  that Chromebooks claim to do that they either don't do or don't do well.  First - Printing.  There is no easy way to print to (most) existing home printers.  You can set it up to use Google Cloud print - it does work, but not without it's share of  hassles.  I do use it that way, but then I have to go to my full featured PC and log into my Google Account.  Then it works seamlessly.  But if your PC is in sleep mode or off, no go.  The print job is queued.  (The exception to this is if you have a true cloud enabled printer, then you can print directly.  But for most of us that means buying a new printer as our existing printers won't have that capability.)  SECOND:  Streaming, such as Netflix.  On the particular Chromebook device I purchased, Netflix is not supported.  This seems to be a big miss by Google.  They are working on it and I'm guessing it will get there, but Streaming is the future of media delivery and Chromebooks need to support it as much as possible.  Streaming is a Cloud feature, right?  THIRD:  Keyboard/Mouse - Awesome keyboard physically, but there is a bit of a learning curve on a few items if you've only ever used MAC/PC solutions.  But I'll give Google/Chrome credit - if people learn how to use both the onscreen keyboard help or the online help system, help is very much available.  You just have to be a bit patient to learn the system.We've had our Chromebook just for over a month.  That's far too short a time period to make any claims as to it's stability or longevity.  But our experience in my family has been positive so far.  It's working for what I purchased it for.  It's small, light, great battery life and works (almost) instantly on startup which means it's great for a quick glace at that email that has that address that you need as you run out the door.  If you're looking for that extra device to get on the web, do email, facebook, some light word processing, then I do think Chromebook is a great solution.", "Date": "January 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "For the price, a good deal", "Author": "Archturiat Baumann", "ReviewID": "RY52Y2UV45WU7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, let's just get this out of the way.  If you come to a Chromebook expecting a machine to run the latest games on or with expectations that it will do the same things as a $500 Windows laptop, you've come to the wrong place.That said, if what you are looking for is a reasonably well-built lightweight machine that provides solid basic applications at a low cost, this is a great choice.  Yes, it's just a machine that runs \"just a web browser.\"  But if you let that limit your view of what's possible, you're missing out.Even inside Google's ecosystem lies enough power to provide most of your needs.  A good solid word processor, a spreadsheet, a usable \"forms\" application for basic databases, and even a presentation graphics package.  Throw in Google Mail and Picasa, and what else does a novice computer user need?  Facebook, YouTube, and even some of the video services (although, because of its reliance on Microsoft Silverlight, sadly not Netflix) all run beautifully.  It also does a fine job of playing local media stored on a thumb drive or even a small hard drive.Even advanced users will find something to like about this Chromebook.  It's super lightweight, all solid state, and the 6-hour battery life is perfect for a \"second laptop\" around the house or for the long excursions where carrying a full-function laptop is too much weight.  Samsung's build quality is fantastic, especially for such a low-cost product. I'm a systems administrator, and it makes a perfect go-anywhere SSH and RDP terminal at a low-cost and light weight.Chrome's \"offline mode\" does a superb job of letting you use Google Drive's features without needing a full-time net connection, so much of what makes this a usable machine doesn't need a tether to the network to work.  As more and more applications are developed to support \"offlining\" (which is not just limited to Chromebooks) this will only improve.No, it's not a replacement (yet) for a full-function computer for everybody.

While being limited to the browser and a few other apps, the chromebook is also technically limited to what the internet has to offer! Which is a shitload, fellas. It's as if you entered a beautiful life-supporting planet. Actually to more accurately put it, you can do most things an average user would need to use on the Chrome OS. However, the Chromebook should not be treated as a desktop replacement. A PC will always be much more better for high intensity tasks such as video editing and gaming. While the 3g edition is not available, tethering is still very possible on phones! FoxFi (tethering) worked flawlessly with the Chromebook.In preparation of going to the Google Cloud, I've been using the Google Play Music Manager and Chrome already. The Google Play music player is quite impressive; you can easily edit song info, album photos, etc very easily. You're playing music that you've uploaded to the cloud with it too, and you're always welcome to download all your music from it from any PC. I'm pretty certain you can still listen to music off-line if you've downloaded it.One of the things that impressed me was the sound quality. The sound really exceeded my expectations... it not being complete junk! The build quality also is very good and looks flawless. It has a fan-less design as well, so there's pretty much no noise being produced. The track pad is highly acclaimed by other reviewers, but I found myself struggling to use it. However I was already not a fan of track pads since I learned that you could not play Counter-Strike 1.6 on it years ago. Heh. There's also the SD expansion slot too fellas, but I've seen in a review that it doesn't fit flush into the laptop, but most laptops are like that. The keyboard is a pretty good size itself, but I was mistyping a few things but that's simply because I'm too used to a keyboard. The charger is very small, but what worries me is that the charging pin may break from being too thin. The performance feels very similar to my quad-core desktop, that is loaded with an SSD as well.This series does have bluetooth support, and it was not mentioned much in many reviews. My BackBeat 903 bluetooth headset didn't seem to pair properly so I'm not too sure if bluetooth audio sets will work on the Chromebook, but BT Mice are definitely supported. USB storage devices work pretty well too, but I have yet to test playing videos or movies off of them. There are specific file formats that the Chromebook can play, so make sure you have files converted.The only thing that I found to dislike was the matte screen. I'm simply used to glossy screens and find matte doesn't look very sophisticated on electronical devices. Taking a look at glossy and matte photos may change your view on it. Well actually, to add to the disliking, Google really needs to step up because they've been slacking their asses off with Netflix support for the past few weeks but I do believe it was functional at one point on other chrome books.Ultimately, Google and Samsung deserve some high fives, and most general users should enjoy this notebook.

It was my tertiary computer and for when I wanted to travel with something lightweight that could access the internet so I could check emails and write.Then I happened to be ill at home and actually managed to spend enough time on it that the battery was running out while I still wanted to be on it, so I plugged it in. And the mouse stopped working. Unplugged it and it worked fine. Plugged it in, the mouse was all messed up. This points to a short in the hardware somewhere, and a dangerous one at that, so I contacted Samsun support and they walked me through the troubleshooting procedures, which is fine, that's protocol, and when that didn't fix it, had me send it in to be fixed. All well and good.And then I got it back. The sheet with it said there was a software issue having to do with startup and they'd fixed it.

But no, because I'm alleging that the first service company damaged the machine, I have to have it sent back to me, I have to take a picture of the damage to send to Samsung, then I have to send it to the first company.

Like all Windows PCs, it has slowed significantly overtime and the battery has begin to fail. I cant make it more than 45 min on battery and besides that, it is heavy. So I always kept it on my desk and I spent a good 4 hours a day working on it as a Web Engineer. I also am a full time student so I need it for writing papers, doing hw online, making spreadsheets, etc. I was always using a flash drive to carry my files around campus and to work. I can say that I am an advanced computer user and I spend a lot of time working on a PC.I purchased the Samsung Chromebook over the summer, and I have only opened the HP laptop once since then. And that was to see if it still worked so I could sell it.Google advertises these as a supplementary laptop, and I think that is a mistake. There is no reason not use this as a primary laptop for 90% of people. I think that there are a lot of misunderstanding concerning Chrome OS that are limiting the sales of these. In addition there are several things aspects of Mac and Windows PCs that people are not willing to break away from due to a brainwashing of advertisements. I am a firm believer that people should use what works for them, so please don't look at me as a snob. I would like to address some ideas that I have heard tossed around by electronics consumers, because many of these ideas are misleading.1. This computer is not powerful enough for my use!So many people are used to seeing Intel core i5's sold in PCs, that the idea of any weaker processor will make their machine useless. This is simply false, I can stream videos online and use multiple apps simultaneously. Windows PCs need strong processors and more RAM because they are running so many background processes as part of the operating system. For the ChromeOS, there is no need for so much horsepower. (although new Chromebooks (Acer C720, HP 14) do offer this)2. I need Microsoft Word and Excel! If I don't have these I can't do my work!You can use FREE WEBAPP VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT WORD AND EXCEL ON SKYDRIVE.LIVE.COM. For whatever reason, nobody knows about this. If you have never tried these before, I strongly encourage you to open a new tab and go to skydrive.live.com right now and sign up. These are free versions of Microsoft Software, produced by Microsoft  available at no charge. I understand that documents need to be created in the Microsoft format, but for personal use only docs, I have come to prefer Google Docs formats because they are lightweight applications. I only see the tools I actually use in the applications.3. I dont want to be online at all times! Google is going to steal my information!This is so crazy I won't even address it. If you really feel this way, then stop looking at Chromebooks because nobody is going to be able to sell you on them.4. 16 GB on-board storage is not enough!I will admit i was worried about switching to Cloud Storage, but Google Drive has been an excellent choice for me personally. I use many different computers throughout my day, and I have all my files with me once I sign into Chrome. If you have ever lost a flash drive before, you know my pain. With Google Drive, your data will never corrupt, and you will never lose your data. You may think that you do not have internet access at all times, but try to think of the last time you wanted to work on a file and you didn't have a wifi connection. the only time I have felt this is commuting to work, and driving long distances. If you use these times to work on documents then you will have to set your documents to be available offline.5. I use specific software that only runs on Windows!This is the only real reason I have ever heard not to buy a Chromebook. I understand plenty of people use Windows software to perform their work. This obviously won't be available for your Chromebook. However, ChromeRDP allows you to remote to any Windows PC. I use this frequently to remote to my work PC from home, and it is so easy to use.6. For only $250, this hardware must be junk!My Samsung Chromebook has had no issued so far, and I rarely hear of screen problems. The 16 GB SSD is almost invincible. These new SolidStateDrives are not like old, noisy, harddrives that would frequently break. With no moving parts in the laptop, we will see that hardware problems will be very very rare. Plus, Samsung is a high-quality hardware manufacturer so you should not be worried about this.My Rating of several Aspects:Processor and RAM Performance: 3/5  These are not designed to be maximum power PCs, but the chipset included is definitely sufficient for all of my needs.Screen: 3/5  The matte finish reduces glare, but I do miss the glossy finish that is so common now.Keyboard: 4/5  This is the best keyboard I have ever typed on, including Mac keyboards. The chiclet style keys are excellent and I type through essays quickly with few errors.Structural Sturdiness: 4/5  This is not the anodized aluminum that Macs are known for, no matter how visually similar it looks. But the strength of the case on this computer is impressive and competes with any <$600 laptop.Design: 5/5  This thing is great for a lightweight laptop that you can take anywhere. I bought a caselogic sleeve for about $15 and I can throw this in my backpack with books and anything else and never worry about it breaking.FINAL NOTE: THE NEW ACER C720 IS A MORE POWERFUL VERSION OF THIS SAMSUNG MODEL FOR THE SAME PRICE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. ALSO DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE RISKS OF BUYING ANY CHROMEBOOK USED. THEY ARE EASILY RESET TO FACTORY SETTINGS.I can check email, listen to music, work on servers remotely via SSH or Chrome RDP, write essays with Google docs or the FREE MICROSOFT WORD AND EXCEL on skydrive.live.com that nobody seems to know about.

It was constantly on back order on Amazon, so I just ordered it on Nov. 10th.  Nov. 16th I got an ETA of end of November delivery but it actually shipped Nov. 21st. Model-S/N sticker on the bottom has an Oct 2012 factory date.I ordered from Canada and used a cross border shipping service to get it here.  This added about $100 to the price, but a chunk of that was 13% HST taxes, there was no duty, and the shipping charge was fair, especially when you consider that Amazon did not charge a U.S. tax and shipping was free.So, if you want this and it says it's on back order, I recommend to just order it and you should get it fairly quickly.  And be sure to post a review.  These are new products and could disrupt the M$ and Apple's of the world, meaning greater choices for us through greater competition. Fair reviews are helpful in encouraging people to give this product a try. I think Google has a winner!This Samsung Chromebook performs flawlessly and *as advertised*.  Many lower ratings of this Chromebook on Amazon are actually rooted in buyers not doing a basic overview of this product before purchasing.  Most complaints are because you can't load Windows programs (.exe), they did not know this is essentially an internet kiosk with nearly everything residing in \"the cloud\" (No, it does not come with and you cannot install MS Word/Excel) or did not realize Netflix does not yet work (it will one day; be patient - consider it an \"early adopter tax\" and relax, knowing you're living on the \"bleeding edge\").This machine is simple and just works. Nothing complicated about it.  If you're a techie, you can move from the \"stable\" channel to \"beta\" or \"developer.\"  Otherwise, just leave it the way it comes and it will simply work.-It boots fast, it shuts down fast and it browses fast. Boot and shut down is faster than any computer I have ever owned.-No viruses, so no need to purchase additional virus software.-Upgrades without any intervention.-Great battery life. Better than the 6.5 hour spec, in my case.-Having read all the reviews of the mediocre screen, I will say that it is better than I anticipated.  I have to turn down the brightness in a dark room.  Limited viewing angles but not an issue for me.  I like the matte screen, as there are no reflections. I would pay $50 more for a great IPS screen but this is perfectly fine, especially for a $250 laptop.-Great keyboard.  Really great keyboard.  Way better than my much sleeker, much more expensive ASUS Zenbook UX21 ultrabook or our our brick of a Dell laptop.  It has tonnes of available keyboard shortcuts.  People say that there is no delete key and you must do an alt+backspace (or something like that) to delete, but this is not my experience.  The backspace deletes the previous letter(s) you typed.  That's all I need it to do.  I love the integrated search/back/forward/reload/maximize keys.  Great modern additions.-No issues with the touchpad.  I'm not a touchpad fan at all (read: hate them); this one doesn't annoy me, which is saying a lot.  Two finger scrolling of pages is perfect.-small power cord.  No one ever mentions this in laptop reviews but it's important, and as many power cords are massive bricks, making it far less portable.-Be sure to buy a sleeve/case for this, as the plastic casing will scratch easily, no different than similar products (Have you ever seen a \"well used\" Macbook Air?  Not pretty).-Printing to my flaky HP eprint printer works flawlessly.TIP: I use Google's 2-step verification (multi-factor authentication), which I recommend everyone try out (use all the backup options when you set it up).  Be sure to try it for 30 days before making up your mind, as the extra sign on step takes getting used to.  If you use it, too, and want your Chromebook to be \"trusted\" (does not require a verification code every time you sign in) after providing the verification code the first time, under Settings > Users > Manage Other Users > check: Show Usernames and Photos on Sign-in Screen (default).  ** If you want to force a verification code every single boot (what I do), do NOT check: Show Usernames and Photos on Sign-in Screen.  This will require you enter your username, password and verification each time.  Warning: It will also require you to have internet access to sign in.These are good, solid little machines.  Google and Samsung have figured out a path to success.  Now, let's see if they can increase supply to match demand and then keep up the marketing effort to build market share.  I wouldn't touch the Acer model, though, and hope that Google keeps the price down without resorting to allowing bad pieces of hardware on to the market with this OS on it. First impressions count and bad hardware will hurt them in the long run.  They should be picky and this great Samsung Chromebook should become the minimum standard, not the gold standard.I plan to buy one or two for the kids to do their homework on after testing this for a few months, so they are not grabbing this one constantly. If it breaks, I can live with the $250 loss.  If it gets stolen, valuable documents will still be accessible in \"the cloud.\"  The constant auto-save and previous versioning of Google docs has saved us numerous homework headaches.As far as first impressions for this Samsung Chromebook, it's great.  It just works, as it should.  No more, no less.  Faster than most machines and, hopefully, it will continue to improve rapidly, as people try out Chrome OS for the first time.This Samsung Chromebook is the sleeper hit of the year.Hope you found this review helpful.

I got it about 10 months ago (just before last Christmas; it was one of the first produced) and have been using it every day since.Pros:* Price point.  Can't beat that.* Weight.  It honestly feels like I'm not carrying anything - I once picked up the neoprene case and almost didn't realize it was empty.* Battery life.  I kid you not, I have gotten 7 hours out of the battery.  That's 7 hours of use, not 7 hours with the monitor off in sleep mode.* Boot speed.  Almost a year in, boot speed is the same as it always was, and it gets me to the login screen in 3 seconds.  Full login in under 10 seconds.* Crash recovery.  When the computer or a window crashes, Chrome reopens everything the way it was.Cons:* The body is made of plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal, but if you pick it up by the palm rest (like most people do) it causes the touchpad to click.  Likewise, if you rest too much weight on your palms, it causes the mouse to click spontaneously.* As an extension of that, the SD card slot has a door on it.  The plastic on it is total crap.  I can't pinpoint any abuse that would cause this, but mine broke off.* Video capabilities.  The computer can't handle youtube videos in high resolution, much less if you load an AVI onto the machine.* Remember, no executable files.  Everyone should know this already, but you can't install programs on this machine.  Just Chrome extensions.* Processor power.  As best I can tell, for tabs containing mild graphics, the machine maxes out around 5-8 tabs.  I think it may have a memory leak as well, as windows left open for over 24 hours have a habit of crashing.Basically, this is a great computer at an unbeatable price, but you need to go into it being aware of its limitations or you will be disappointed.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm loving it!", "Author": "Julie H. Rose", "ReviewID": "R12955DRJGS506", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used an Apple computer of some sort since they came out. My old Macbook was showing the signs of imminent death and so I was planning on buying a MacBook Air. There's no Apple store near me, so I went to a Big Store (where I thought I'd get to try one). Nope. They had iPads and Windows laptops, but no MacBook Airs. I noticed the Chromebook display and checked them out.After looking at the iPads, I was (understandably) not impressed with the screen on the Samsung. Still, I tried it. The keyboard seemed really nice, nicer than the one on my MacBook. The touchpad, though a bit small for my taste, seemed responsive. The fact that it was plastic escaped me until I read a review. Oh, it's \"fake aluminum!\" Well, I don't care. It's a nicely designed machine. But, I didn't buy it then. I went home to research and think about whether I would be happy with using Chrome and no programs.So, I analyzed my computer usage for about a week and made the plunge. At $248, it seemed like a decent risk. After all, I've been spending almost a thousand dollars every three years for the latest Mac (yes, that's how long they've all lasted me). If I wound up using the Chromebook for a short while, or only when I'm out, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.I've had the machine for a week now, and I'm thrilled. I love a good deal, and the Chromebook is that. No, it doesn't have a gorgeous screen. It looks kinda grainy (and yes, I know that's not tech talk). However, I have discovered that a matte screen is easier on my eyes, and so I'm glad. The keyboard is indeed very nice; the keys are big, and there's just the right amount of \"bounce\" for my taste. There's some odd spacing issues for some keyboard shortcuts, but I assume I'll get used to them.I could care less that it's plastic. It doesn't have a plastic feel, and it is a very nice design. I wish the keyboard could be backlit when needed, but at this price, I won't quibble.I expected it to just be Chrome, but there's a nice files manager if one plugs in a hard drive or thumb drive. There's enough Google apps to do most jobs I need to do. MS Office online is a bit too \"lite\" for me, but I expect I'll manage. I don't use any specialized software for my work.The only serious complaint I have is that Bluetooth doesn't work on speakers right now. Really? I have to plug them in? That's a serious oversight that Google ought to fix asap.But still, this computer is a great deal, and I'm tickled that I didn't spent much money on it. It seems ridiculous to spend $750 more to get a MacBook Air. That's what I'm comparing this to. This computer is light, stylish, easier than heck to use, doesn't use Windows (thank goodness), and has some really lovely OS touches that took this ex-Mac user less than an hour to figure out.If you're looking for a computer to get online with, to bring on trips, and don't use Photoshop, or CAD/CAM, or any other \"serious\" programs, look no further for your next computer. It'll make you feel smart that you saved so much money. Go out and spent the rest of something totally frivolous. Me? I don't need an aluminum chassis machine. This is a tool for the mind, not an automobile.So, with a few problems, 5 stars (easily)! If the screen was better & Google fixed the Bluetooth issue, I'd give it ten stars. Oh yeah, I can't.

I also satisfied my need for something Apple with an iPhone 4S (but I will be upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 when my contract is up at the end of the year. Sorry, Apple, I don't want your ugly gold iPhone.) ANYWAY. I love this Chromebook. It is the best deal for the price. If you looking for a computer to give a teenager or a college kid it's great for that. Transferring between Google Docs and Microsoft Word (or the other programs) is simple, so that's not an excuse to not buy the Chromebook. It takes some time getting used to how everything runs but once you get it it is simple. If you love keyboard shortcuts, the Chromebook is full of them. This machine is versatile and sleek (it really looks like a MacBook Air but is a fraction of the cost). It is very light and portable. It has a good battery life and charges quickly. If you're already using Google Chrome as your browser, doing typical internet things is exactly the same.Things I Do With The Chromebook:-Watch TV/Netflix. Unplug the HDMI cable from your cable box and put it in the Chromebook. You can mirror the screens or use the TV as a second monitor. Anyway, I can stream movies quickly right on to the TV.-Listen to music. I have a two Bluetooth speakers and the Chromebook connects right to them. With the Pandora app, you're good to rock out.-Work. I can create docs using Google's apps, save them to the drive and then open them on my PC in a Microsoft program if necessary.-Social media stuff. It's the same as on a traditional computer.I know I'm not using the device to its full potential and there are so many more uses and applications. The reps at a Best Buy are great and will talk to you about how to make the Chromebook do what you want it to do.I'm pretty sure I will be purchasing two more Chromebooks during the holiday season (on Amazon).Happy browsing!UPDATE: I've had this Chromebook for 10 months. It still works perfectly (minus the normal hiccups that would come from having my Chromebook set on the Beta channel. Dev scares me though.)

Since it was a busy few days at work, I didn't notice my Chromebook had been sitting in a puddle of water for two days (when I finally had time to sit in front of the TV again; remember I have separate work computer...). I was pretty disappointed. I knew I could buy another Chromebook...BUT this was my modded-out personalized Chromebook and I didn't want to reprogram all of my settings. I turned it over and let all of the water drip out. When I was sure there was no water left in it I plugged it in and let it charge up--when I plugged the charger in the light went on--this is a really good sign. I let it charge for about 2 hours.

Prior to this device, I was taking notes in a good, old-fashioned notebook, which was fine... I guess. My note taking in class was goodish, but during second semester my note taking was phenomenal. Using Google Drive, I could organize my notes into specific class topics, as well as certain units and class dates. Not only did this benefit me, but it was much easier to email the notes that I took to other classmates who had missed class than it used to be to lend them my notebook and get it back later that week. Taking notes in Google Drive is life changing even if it were only for one thing: the search function. If I'm supposed to study about the Renaissance in Europe, and certain things about Italy are spread out across the semester, I no longer have to page through my notebook and try to find Italy in my notes. All I need to do is type \"Italy\" into the search bar and it automatically shows me all of my documents that have Italy in them.

There used to be a problem with the video playback which caused the computer to be severely bogged down while watching YouTube, but it has been resolved as far as I can tell.

The unit kept restarting randomly, freezing and crashing for no apparent reason. I troubleshooted the issue and attempted to repair it following the advice of Google Forums, reliable tech web articles and Samsung Support, but none of this resolved the issue. The issues were so severe and frustrating that I considered returning it and not ever buying a Google/Samsung product ever again.My girlfriend recommended returning it for an exchange unit and I followed her advice (thankfully!).

Assuming that the first faulty unit I received was an exception, the Samsung Chromebook is an amazing product!Structurally, the unit is solid, very lightweight and even though it's made of plastic, it looks and feels sleek. The screen is bright and the image detail is great. The keyboard is a delight, the keys are firm and springy and seem to take abuse and fast typing. The trackpad is responsive and the gesture controls are cool.Performance-wise, the unit is amazing! It boots up in seconds (around 8) and the apps/browser runs smooth. There are some noticeable delays in screen renderings when scrolling, some skips on videos when changing tabs and some minor lagging when more apps or tabs are running. You have to remember, this is a $250 unit, so it won't run like a supercomputer. You cannot expect immediate tab switching or super smooth multitasking, but for an obsessive and highly critical guy, the unit works magnificently.Regarding the Google-ish aspects of the computer, this will force you to use Google Docs, Drive and the other Google Apps and this is totally a good thing!

This thing is only $5.99 via Prime and is the best built charger I have ever purchased.  See my review of it.Main ReviewI bought my Chromebook used in \"Like New\" condition from Amazon Warehouse Deals for $189.  It had a dented and opened box but it appeared to be unused.This review will focus on daily use from a traveling salesman.  I fly once per week and stay 3 nights per week in hotels.  My goal is to have something light, quick to start, easy to use, and fulfill my basic tasks.I unpacked it, plugged in the charger, turned it on, logged into my  Google account, launched Chrome, signed into my wifi, and started surfing.  I did not read anything to get started.I have a 13\" Toshiba laptop, a 10\" Toshiba Thrive Tablet, and Droid 2 cell phone.  This device is rapidly replacing everything but the cell.  Since I use the cell to tether the Chromebook for internet access when needed the are now a pair.I use this to surf, read both gmail and corporate Exchange email, do light spreadsheets, word docs, and even power point in their Google Docs equivalent programs, read Kindle books (which are down loadable), and listen to streamed music and down loaded to the SD card music.  I can even stream Amazon Prime and Netflix.  I have also accessed my corporate reports on a COGNOS system.I have paired it via bluetooth with a mouse and keyboard and hooked it to my 50\" plasma tv and played Angry Birds.  I also opened some web pages, printed them via Google Cloud Print, and downloaded them to read later.This by far the best technology buy I have ever made.hint: use \"swap enable\" for better performance, make sure download some apps, books, and games for offline use.I will update periodically as I try it over a range uses , apps, and settings,May 22:  Two days on the road:  This thing is light and thin which makes it easy to carry.  Used it on a 2 hour flight with no wifi and read a downloaded book and worked on a letter and a spreadsheet.  Loved the way it fires up in about 30 seconds.  Logged onto hotel wifi and streamed Amazon and Netflix with no problems.  Added some more apps and downloaded Angry Birds for offline play.  Have not found a way to store music internally so I am buying a micro usb card (the kind that barely protrude from the slot).  Next thing up is to figure out how to download some email for offline use and trying out Office 365.  I went two days of light use never turning it off and I still have 30% battery.May 30:  Duh, downloaded music into Google Play Music for offline listening.  It is very basic but good enough for the very little time I am not streaming Slacker.  I am finding mixed reviews on using 365 on a Chromebook so for now I am learning to live with Google Docs and use my Win8 laptop for just very intense spreadsheets.June 11:  Office 365 can only be used online and not installed on a Chromebook.  Office Apps by Microsoft is free if you have Microsoft Skydrive.  It is ran online but it is real Office programs with all the functionality most users will need.  I would not recommend Google docs for document creation but it is fine for light editing. So I now use my Win 7 laptop, anchored in my office, for MS Office document creation, use Google Docs offline if I must edit while away from wifi which is very rare, and use Office Apps while on the road with wifi.  Which means the Chrome is still my road device of choice.  The instant on and small form factor make it irresistible.Wifi/Bluetooth tethering via my droid is working great so I almost never am without web access.Durability is fine.

They have both a Linux based Kernel (roughly the word for core software engine) but Android has many Java based elements (one of the reasons why the 'controllers'(Sun Microsystems) of Java sewed Google.  So Android apps need some adjustment to run in the Google Chrome OS environment, which is a completely browser based OS with its roots in Linux.  It would be easier to simply use Android (have access to all the apps) or the other, and there have been rumors that they merge (unlikely but possible?!).  There is good reason for Google to have Chrome OS to compete with Windows, so who knows.  So when I said it's a tablet with a keyboard (see review below), it really is kind of its own thing.  It would be nice if it was a tablet with a keyboard (Android apps 100% no issue).  No matter what, Google has invested a lot in Google Chrome and will support it in the future.  It's just important to note that the Chromebook is at least a great web browser enabled tool, but it's not a complete substitute for a Windows laptop or MacBook Pro with all the s/w installed on a local base.  Web based apps will have some delays and will depend on a decent wifi connection, and how busy the webservers are running other people's apps etc etc.  But it's a neat tool.  You have to understand what you are buying here though.  It's not a traditional laptop as we are used to.This is really neat for on the go or browsing the web on the sofa.It is basically a tablet with a very decent keyboard (to me the same keyboard quality as an Apple MacBook Air or MacBook Pro (this one is nicely backlit), both of which I own and use...Samsung makes the Apple processors in the USA as well as the ones inside this ChromeBook, of course totally different CPUs) and mouse pad (the screen is not a touch screen to not mislead you with the term tablet).  And this is key to understand:  the technology and the micro chip powering this is a processor powering many Samsung tablets; it's for mobile use and concepts.  I should also mention that I am electronics engineer and that I am involved with what's inside that unit.  I purchased this for someone who needed a computer that is portable and can get all the things done young people in particular 'need' ... You Tube, Facebook, Twitter etcThe computing power available in this unit gets it all done sufficiently.  The idea of this unit is that it runs OS Google Chrome and that everything is cloud based, meaning you store most of your stuff on the web primarily (and 16GB of local storage to hold apps and immediately needed stuff) , so it's accessible on any computer anywhere in the world even if you do not carry your Chrome Book with you.  Therefore the 16GB local storage are enough for most people, and the unit comes with 100GB of cloud based storage (Google Drive Cloud Storage) (free for 2 years and then a nominal fee, check with Google).  This chrome book has 2GB DDR3 RAM and a 16 GB Solid State Drive (no mechanical harddrive), sufficient to not limit you (and there is an SD card reader for more stuff).  What's important to have is the WiFi connection, so you can browse the web and use the cloud storage and use all your apps (Of course you can play locally stored apps like angry bird etc).  This computer has a very good wifi radio with all the standards running (wifi 802.11 a/b/g/n 2x2).  It also has blue tooth, so you can stream your music channels from Pandora to an external Bluetooth compatible speaker system for example.  Works great.The machine is as good as the apps you use (word processing, spreadsheet etc) in rough terms.  There is software/apps to be productive on the go, play,read, or browse the web (with wifi connection) or 'socialize' with Facebook etc...I meant to say use social media ;-).This Chromebook is connectivity itself.  It has the newest USB 3.0 port and also a USB2.0 port to afford all compatibility and speed.  It has a HDMI port, so you can playback anything on your big screen.  There is an SD card reader.  And as mentioned wifi of course (the lifeline to make this what it is for) and the Bluetooth interface (3.0). There are internal stereo speakers (ok) and headphone/mic connectivity.  External storage is really unlimited (the web itself or in more practical terms all the web server space you 'own/lease' , so you are not limited by the previously mentioned 100GB of free for 2 years Google Drive Cloud Storage (you can rent more) and there are other safe on-line storage solutions which you can access from anywhere in the world with or without your chrome book).  So the future of your stuff does not depend on the lifetime of your Chromebook in case you end its life going diving with it.The screen is a low-glare matte screen in HD quality (11.6\" with 1366 x 768 pixels), which you can appreciate if you ever owned a MacBook Air etc and you cannot control the lighting situation.The battery can last a lot longer than 6 hours (I have seen 8 hours), officially 6.5 hours average.Booting up is about instant due to the solid state storage (and the operating system) once the machine had been set up with google credentials and the wifi, which takes 'no time'.  The Chromebook updates automatically and because everything is cloud based, virus protection is build in and there is no extra software required for that, so really completely carefree operation.I wish I had this option a few years ago when I purchased my MacBook Air for ~ $1500.  Of course this Chromebook is high quality plastic, but it is surprisingly solid considering the cost of this ChromeBook.Overall this gets 5 stars for what this unit delivers from functionality to value to ease of operation.

The Samsung Chromebook is meant to be just a Chrome browser packed in a quiet, lightweight machine.  If you want to install Windows, Microsoft Office or iTunes (or any program), this isn't the laptop for you.  I think it makes a great secondary computer.  I have an older 13\" Macbook that I use in clamshell mode with in external monitor as a desktop.  I have that for when I need to access websites that my Chromebook can't, like a school site the uses Silverlight.  For most of my web surfing and email, I prefer my Chromebook.  The keyboard is really good (a bit slicker than a Macbook, but still good) and the trackpad is responsive (not perfect, but good).  The battery lasts a long time, especially when the screen brightness is lower.  I can even use Remote Desktop to get back to my main computer if I need to do something I can't do on my Chromebook.  The Chromebook is ideal for times when you want to just grab a computer and browse because it starts up VERY quickly and has a good keyboard.  It is lightweight enough that taking it to school isn't a chore.  The computing speed is pretty good, there is no annoying fan or excessive heat to burn your legs.  If you don't like Google Docs or Chrome, don't get this machine.  Google Docs and the other Google Drive apps are the primary productivity apps and I have found them useful for my light word processing needs.  I feel that I am able to get a lot more work done on this than on a tablet with a keyboard.  I find connecting a Bluetooth keyboard to a tablet very frustrating because of the inevitable lag.

I have not been disappointed.About me:I really wanted something that I could use to casually browse the internet and do some light word processing. I'm pretty integrated with the Google ecosystem (gmail, google docs, android phone) and rely on Amazon's Cloud Player for all of my music needs. That said, pretty much everything I do on my computer is web-based.Things I like:-The computer itself is really light and sturdy, and also pretty stylish (a few of my friends thought that it was a small Macbook Air when they first saw it).  It doesn't feel cheap, but it also isn't something that would make me hesitant to throw it on the couch or in my book bag. I'm going to be backpacking within a month and can't wait to bring this along. I don't even think that I'll bring a case.-Battery life is great. I haven't pushed the battery to its limit, but I'll frequently do some work on my computer at Starbucks for a few hours at a time and have never run out of juice or had any need to bring the charger.-Price point. At $250, you can't be the price on this thing.-Noise.  This computer makes no noise whatsoever. It also doesn't heat up, like my previous laptops have.-Slots. There are lots of different cable slots and memory card slots.Ares for improvement:-Sound quality. The speakers on this computer are pretty weak and my music doesn't sound very good unless I plug in some nice headphones.-Performance. There is generally some lag when web pages load, but it's not a big issue for me.My advice to anyone considering a Chromebook is to consider your actual needs. I read a bunch of complaints in the reviews  about how your chromebook becomes pretty much useless if there isn't an internet connection. In my own experience, every computer is pretty useless without the internet nowadays, so it wasn't a determining factor for me.

I use google everything but was not sold that this device could satisfy my needs. The first few days I was pretty convinced that I was going to need to take this chromebook back. I then learned a few tricks about the OS that I liked and remembered that this is afterall a $250 laptop.I was interested in this particular model because it runs an ARM cpu and that should promise better battery life. Furthermore, as Ubuntu (linux distro) keeps pushing into the phone market Linux support for ARM is getting stronger everyday. In fact, if wanted this \"chromebook\" will run Ubuntu 13.04, I have done it and it works remarkably well.At first I wanted to compare this device to my nexus 4 or $3000 gaming computer. Neither of which is a fair comparison and led to my immediate dissatisfaction with the device.I broke out my old Asus EEE PC netbook and decided to compare against that. The EEE PC never satisfied my needs in regards to battery life and overall functionality; particularly it had WiFi issues at my University and would rarely go more than 3 hours between charges. I also had to shut it off to put it in my bag and thus take a minute or so booting back up at the beginning of every class.This chromebook appears to easily go its advertised 6.5 hours. I would estimate I am getting about 7 to 8 hours per full charge actually. The display is adequate but you won't be watching movies with friends or doing any work outside. The screen is a matte finish which to me is ideal for its application. The device produces very little heat, could even just be heat trapped from my own body when using it on my lap, thus I have no issues closing it and throwing it in a book bag. Next, even if I did shut it down, this thing is reliably booting up in just under 10 seconds.Obviously this is not my gaming computer or even nexus 4, I say that because most of everything you can do on it is ran from the chrome web browser. As mentioned before I am an avid user of Google products, so the transition to google docs, google calendar, etc was not difficult or foreign to me.So what changed. Well first knowing I can use Ubuntu if I want and that it runs better than it did on my EEE PC (direct comparison). Secondly learning how to open webapps in a way that tricks me into thinking its a native app. I know this is silly but I don't like the idea of everything I open being a tab in chrome. You can \"right click\" and change the way \"apps\" open and one such way is to open in a window. For me this makes for a cleaner user experience.The software is constantly being updated and is completely seamless to the user. I have \"wiped the device\" a few times now and logging back in everything is just as you left it minus files locally stored, welcome to the cloud. Early versions of the software apparently had issues with the major video streaming services. I have used netflix, hulu, youtube, and amazon with no issues.Pros-Price-Battery Life-Seamless user experience-Option of Ubuntu as an OS-Weight-Bluetooth Audio A2DP support in newest Beta releaseCons-Few native apps (Gotten better since Google I/O 2013 and introduction of packaged apps)-lack of bluetooth audio (fixed as of May 24, 2013 on Beta channel)After a week with this laptop I am pretty sure I will be keeping it.

There are no native apps which means no Microsoft Word, Office, Excel, no Adobe Photoshop, no software you download to the laptop itself.

With that said, there is some use offline as well.I love this laptop. It does everything I need it to when I being it to class with me. I use Google Drive to store all of the information from my classes. Since it doesn't run Microsoft, I export everything to the Google equivalent and it works fantastically. Other than PowerPoints not opening in Google Slides if they are over a certain size (which I remedy by using my library's computers to cut the presentation into two, then upload it to Drive). I collaborate with my lab groups using Google Docs, and all of the websites I need for homework (blackboard, mastering physics, reddit) run smoothly.The battery life (I usually get around 6 or 7 hours depending on how bring I keep the screen) combined with the small charger are great when I am on campus the whole day. I don't have to lug around my primary laptop (which is over 7 pounds) just to take notes, do problems, or write papers. It connects to the wireless at my school flawlessly (which can be a pain in especially crowded areas), due to the a/b/g/n connectivity capabilities.

No more ten minute set up procedures, simply log in and you have a running computer. I had it runnning and charging for over six hours and no more lap heat. To me thats the worst part of laptops. You are sitting there grinding on your work and suddenly your lap is sweating.I would reccoment this to anyone, especially someone who is tired of getting calls from grandma asking how to check her emails.No you cant play world of Warcraft or black ops on this.

Over the first two months and many automatic updates later, I have a smooth operating, 6+ hour battery life, fantastic machine.The gap between Chromebooks and traditional mac/pc's is slimmer than many people make it out to be. Yes this machine cannot do much offline aside from watching previously downloaded video on the 15 gb drive or using the google editing suite as long as it is installed (docs, presentations, spreadsheets). Comparing what most people use their mac/pc's for when internet is not available, the typical user will have similar if not identical useability.My biggest highlight of this machine is the stability of the Chrome operating system. Malware, viruses, and other problems that bog down pc's (and mac's to a lesser degree) don't do a single blessed thing to performance of my Chromebook. I'll make a guess this is thanks to the unique cloud software setup from Google that keeps viruses at bay, and performance at a high and stable level.For $250, you will not find a comparable computer with performance or parts that can keep up. The 6+ hour battery keeps me up and working (or playing :p) much longer than I had before. This chromebook is a great jumping point as a second computer for the traveling professional, or even a primary machine for the typical internet browsing person.What this is for:- web browsing- word editing (through google docs)- use of web applications- online video up to 720p (1080p works but I notice that the frame rate per second is a little slow for my liking)What this is NOT for:- complex data editing (excel, access, other database software that is not available)- photo editing (again, not isntallable software)- games that require high amounts of RAM and CPU power", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent for what it is and a great value", "Author": "Margaret Picky", "ReviewID": "R34ZVS3N6LWQY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Chromebook is perhaps the best value in an electronic device that I have ever owned.  I was already a heavy user of Google services (browser, mail, calendar, documents, music, videos, talk, etc.) so it was not a hard decision to buy one when this new version came out, primarily for taking notes during an evening literature course.  My regular computer is a Mac mini.The Chromebook was on backorder but when it came back in stock, I placed the order and it arrived the afternoon before the first class.  It is so simple and intuitive that I was able to get it set up and become familiar enough with it to take notes in class that evening without any problems, although I did go a few minutes early to set up the Wi-Fi.  It also allows me to have access to Kindle books while in class for the discussion.It really is much better than I expected it to be.  I was surprised at how thin and attractive it is compared to the photographs\u2014they make it look clunky.  It is about the size of a standard spiral-bound notebook.  Even the power brick is small.From reading the reviews, I was very worried about the quality of the screen and its brightness but the matte screen is ideal for my use and it is more than bright enough\u2014I don't even keep it on high.  I was also worried that it would look and feel cheap, flex, and scratch easily.  It is definitely plastic and not metal but I appreciate the how light it is and have not had trouble with it scratching and the hinge is sturdy.  The only way it feels cheap is that concentrated pressure on the back of the lid will cause ripples in the screen.  It is not the most powerful computer as far as storage and RAM but I think of it as a tablet with a keyboard rather than as a laptop.Other things I really like are how it starts up almost instantly, the excellent quality of the keyboard and touchpad, how easily it connects to Wi-Fi, and the attractive design. The design is also very thoughtful in little ways such as the slot to open it with, the placement of the headphone jack, and the special function keys.There are definitely some things I don't like.  It is very difficult to select text with the touchpad so at home, I use a wireless mouse when I want to copy & paste or format text.  Every once in a while, when I am taking notes, the Google Docs tab crashes and says \"Aw, Snap!\"  I have never lost anything and it is easy to recover from that by opening a new tab but it is aggravating and I don't know why it happens.  I also do not feel 100% comfortable using public Wi-Fi so I have sometimes used it in class without connecting to it.Overall, though, I really like the Samsung Chromebook.

It is super thin and extremely light (lighter than most all laptops including ultrabooks), and has a nice keyboard and trackpad that feel very Macbook Air-ish.Software:The software on the Chromebook if you don't already know is Chrome OS. It is built around the Google Chrome internet browser, so everything you do is online, with the exception of offline Google docs. Chromebooks are used to be cloud computing devices. With that being said, if you don't use the Google ecosystem you might not be the most satisfied with Chromebook, because Chrome OS relies deeply on Google integration (Google Drive, Google Chrome, Google Play Music, and pretty much everything Google).Using this Chromebook:My experience with the laptop has been very good so far. This Chromebook is good enough for most daily tasks on the web. (And is as a mentioned above, is a great piece of hardware for the price). If all you want to do is go on the web and you want something simple, and easy to use, then this is a good device for you. The fact that it awakes from sleep so quickly and is instantly ready to go is really great. What you are giving up with a cheap device like this is, is performance. Since it is a lower end device, and the specs are not as beefed up as something like the Chromebook Pixel, you don't get the fastest web experience. Don't get me wrong, websites load very quickly and it is a stable experience, however, the web performance is not quite buttery smooth. Scrolling thru content filled web pages can be a little choppy, and YouTube videos can be stuttery at times, but for the most part, when streaming HD videos from YouTube and other sites such as Netflix, the experience is good enough. Also, Chrome OS does not support full PC or Mac programs so if that is something that you were expecting from this Chromebook, then I would suggest you look elsewhere. I would also suggest this Chromebook as a secondary computer.", "Date": "April 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great computer", "Author": "izzojackal", "ReviewID": "R2ALRN05J9KIXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this little computer and get compliments on it all the time.

That's a lot of what I do on a computer.This sumsung chromebook suits that purpose very well, especially for the $250 price. It has a good keyboard, although I prefer the keyboard on the CR-48 (google's prototype machine from a couple of years back) which has more bounce in the keys. The trackpad is much better than the CR-48. But what really makes this special is that it's lightweight and quiet (no fan).Because of the light weight, ironically, it's easier to do tablet like reading on it than a tablet. Often I find myself holding  it with one hand, my left, underneath the keyboard, while my right hand scrolls on the trackpad. Because of the weight distribution of the L shape of a screen/keyboard laptop, it's more comfortable to balance in my palm than trying to hold a flat tablet with one hand.I should mention the experience I had with a defect unit. I originally bought this on Amazon several months ago. The one thing that I didn't like about it was that the screen looked \"grainy\", not very clear. But, because I had bought the unit online and had not been able to demo it in the store, I assumed that was the way it was. The screen over time started to flicker and turn blue on the sides. I eventually returned it and bought another unit. With this second unit, the screen is not grainy; it's much better than the first one ever was. If I would have demoed it in the store I would have realized the first one was a defect and returned it right away.As far as the chrome OS is concerned, I enjoy the fast boot up times and easy maintenance of having an OS dedicated to a browser. I do however, like to use a linux shell for some of my work/research/fun. Although there a lot of online options via the browser, like Cloud 9, I like to have my own local machine to play with. I recently bought a Raspberry Pi (only $35 dollars) for this purpose.I have the Raspberry Pi in the basement, plugged in to the ethernet and always on. I use the chrome plug in \"Secure Shell\" to connect to the raspberry pi and do linux shell stuff. It's fast and seamless.

But I'm telling you, once you get the hang of using Google Docs for typing documents, Google slides for creating presentations, Google Calendar for setting dates, etc., you will not want to go back. If you lose your Chromebook or find yourself without it, you can go onto any device that connects to the Internet and find your documents, presentation, calendar, etc.Technically, you don't even need a Chromebook to use those products, just a Google account. But then you wouldn't have such an efficient, fast machine to use them on--and why would you ever want that?---------Just a couple notes on the downsides:1. Printing is an issue if you don't have a \"Cloud Print Ready\" printer. Since I don't, my computer scientist husband had to find a work-around.2. You cannot download external programs.

I tried the setup per Google and it hasn't worked yet.  Basically what I have to do is go to another computer, log into the Google account, and then print from there.

This major price-shift in the chromebook line took it from (IMHO) overpriced, to competitively priced. Because of the new price-point, you can think about this as a budget friendly laptop (if you use mostly web apps) or tablet replacement. Especially if you're someone who does a lot of typing and isn't a fan of doing it on tablet screens!I don't use it much myself, but I've talked with the recipient extensively, and this is a summary of their thoughts. They're a professional video editor who uses this as a supplemental portable computer when traveling, or just around the house where the have wi-fi and don't want to be chained to a serious editing station computer.Form: This is a compact, sexy looking laptop. Although it's plastic, it's well built, slim, and finished to look like brushed aluminum. Very nice. Notably, the keyboard is a full sized for normal human hands. I sort of expected it to feel cramped, but it feels normal sized and eminently usable.Specs: Screen is 1366-by-768 (16:9) so while you won't be able to view full 1080p video, 720 video looks great though. Dual Core processor w/ 2gb ram made web browsing with numerous tabs open quite snappy. Performance does drop off a bit if you're one of those crazy people who has to have 20 or 30 or 40+ tabs open at the same time. Camera is unequivocally made for things like skype, not for taking high-def pictures, but it suits its purpose just fine. For ports, you've got one each of USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and HDMI, so you can connect a mouse if you want or link it up to your TV for streaming HD video! There is a card reader for SD/SDHC/SDXC and audio has a mic input and headphone output. Local storage is somewhat compact at 16gb, but this is compensated by google drive access (100gb free for two years!) and can be supplemented by dropbox, amazon cloud, skydrive, etc.Web Apps: The giftee already lived extensively in the google web-app environment so they jumped right in! When I purchased it, this came with two years of 100gb google drive storage. Pretty cool. Otherwise web apps and such work just the way you expect them to work.Overall: If you want a super portable and very stylish laptop, you're comfortable working in the google environment of web apps, you have ready access to wi-fi, and you're on a budget so you don't want to shell out ~$1000 for a mac air, this is a fantastic product.Negatives:1) You really need to have wi-fi access to use this most effectively. Evaluate your wi-fi accessibility carefully before you take the plunge, and note that your local storage is limited to 16gb. Without that extra 100gb of google drive, or access to your dropbox/amazon cloud/skydrive you can easily feel the constrained.2) There is no support for netflix. Presently, every chromebook EXCEPT for this one (Samsung, ARM based) can stream netflix. Hulu and Amazon streaming both work fine but this is a pretty glaring negative for folks who are thinking about a chromebook for its portability and access to web apps.EDIT:The Samsung Chromebook now supports netflix streaming. I'll leave the original review for posterity, but negative #2 is effectively removed. I don't think it bumps this chromebook up to a 5th star, as negative #1 still stands, but it's a very nice improvement, and I'm very glad that google/samsung kept their commitment to netflix support!", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the teenager in the house", "Author": "Jessica J.

I have tried various android tablets, and iPad, and MAc / Windows laptops. The Macbook Air my wife had was the closest but still I prefer the Chromebook so far. The main reasons are the instant on and connected (no waiting for anything what so ever after opening the lid). In addition the the browsing using the trackpad is very much like the MacbookAir (responsive scrolling with two fingers). The browsing experience is flawless so far, and seems really fast.Second, I wanted something to watch Amazon Instant Videos on, and while I have only watched a couple of trailers so far everything has been great. The speakers are pretty bad, but I use headphones for that.Third, I wanted to have a laptop up with ESPN Gamecast on during football games (and I expect to do the same during NASCAR season). I like to keep an eye on the stats without waiting for the TV to fill me in. The built in base (because it has a keyboard) keeps the screen at a great angle to look over and see without having to go pick it up.Finally, I wanted something I can take on business trips to watch videos. I will update my review when I have actually done this but it looks plausible to download videos and watch them from an SD card.I have tried many iterations (and frankly I have purchased from BestBuy because I can return them more easily after trying them for a few weeks). I have tried the MacbookAir ($1100 was way too pricey to meet these needs, but equally effective as the Chromebook). Various android tablets (the Slider was almost there but touching the screen to scroll, small keyboard, and screen angle). The google nexus 7 (great for reading in bed but not sitting next to the couch).The things that you probably still need a laptop for are Office apps (rollapps openOffice beta looks promising though), anything you need to VPN into to get to your corporate apps, and any windows only apps that have to be installed. Also printing is special. You have to use Google cloud print, which means you either get a cloud print ready printer, or on a computer that does have the printer drivers installed open chrome and use that to print through.Overall I am extremely impressed and happy with this purchase. $250 and does most everything I need. I would think that if I had kids that needed a laptop this would be ideal as well.

You're not expecting this to look or feel like a Macbook Air (neither the display nor the trackpad are going to meet THAT expectation, but they are better than other \"netbooks\" you may have used).Just buy it. It's $249 bucks for a little portable laptop that has a baked in backup and sync plan. Anything you do on it out in the field can be pulled right back up from your main desktop Chrome browser. It turns on fast and it weighs about as much as a paperback book. Make sure you have plenty of Wi-FI or hotspot access because otherwise it's not going to do much for you (there are 2 USB ports, so you could plug in a Cellular data stick if you have one).One thing I'm still experimenting with is the output to external monitors. The graphics card is fast and clean enough, but perhaps not configurable to every external monitor you can think of. Sometimes it mirrors, sometimes it only displays on the external monitor. That's an HDMI cable connection, by the way.So, look... here's a little 11\" solid state netbook you can hand off to your younger kids and not have a heart attack everytime they're quiet for 30 seconds (there's a guest login account that will act like an incognito browser, without saving any settings or history). As of right now Google is giving out 100 GB of drive storage free for a couple years along with these... you redeem it through a \"Goodies\" window upon initial setup. You don't get to return the laptop and keep the cloud storage, though.Bottom line, it's a solid build of an excellent concept.

If you do not adapt to change well/quickly, your mileage may vary with the Samsung Chromebook.I ordered this particular machine because it is capable of doing all of the things that a beginning college student needs, and for the least amount of money. The things I consider \"needs\" are the ability to take notes, edit documents, create documents, and access online content (yes the Chromebook supports Flash Player).Typical User Experience Summary:My experience with the Chromebook has been quite pleasant after one week of use. I have gotten accustomed to the Internet-based applications, and enjoy them on my college's free Wi-Fi network each day I have class. I take notes with the Scratchpad app in my Math, English, Psychology and History classes and my notes are immediately backed up to Google Drive after any modification to a document. No hassle with the usual File-> Save As that you experience in Windows or Mac OS X. After each edit or addition to a document, the Chromebook will sync and back up any document you are working with and you can just close it when you're finished. While the Chromebook cannot load an install of Microsoft Office for Word, PowerPoint, or Excel, you CAN edit MS Office documents in the free web-based application called Google Docs, which is free to anyone with a Google account (you don't even need a Chromebook to use Google Docs).Technical Information:I usually get 1.5 days of use on a single charge with medium-high brightness settings, and I am very pleased with these results. The internal ARM CPU/GPU combo keeps the laptop running pretty cool, with the occasional warm feeling after extended amounts of use (make note of WARM, not HOT). The display is clear and of good quality at 1366x768 resolution, and the brightness settings are varied enough to suit anyone's preferences with a quick adjustment from the Brightness keys on the top of the keyboard.Short Version:The impressive stuff:-battery life is fantastic, easily 1-1.5 days of life on a single charge if you don't max out the brightness 24/7-boot time is around 5-7 seconds, shut down time about the same if not a little quicker-all of the included FREE Google software runs excellently, quick and easy to pick up in one sitting-most of the Google apps can sync with Android devices should there be an Android version of the application i.e. Chrome Browser, Google Drive, Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Keep, Google Play Music, etc.-can handle quite a few Browser tabs open with little performance drop-laptop runs cool, rarely gets a little warm. Never gets hot to the touch.The (minor) disappointments:-HD video playback in YouTube is just not possible. It is choppy, and will eventually freeze to the point of just audio running. Must play YouTube videos at 360/480p to get a steady and easily viewable stream.-No LED backlighting on the keyboard keys. Just realized how useful a feature like this would be, as I am typing this review in the dark while watching a movie.-the build seems to be very cheap, all plastic.

I think the people that have been disappointed are the ones that do not fully understand the features of Chromebook and what it is mean to do/not meant to do.  It's all about expectations!I got Chromebook specifically for graduate school.  My husband just picked one up for college. We both already have access to a PC with Microsoft Office through our gaming laptops and also available for use at school and the local library.  For us, this is a supplementary device that we both plan to use specifically for note-taking, internet browsing, school email to communicate with professors and classmates, accessing course materials, reading and researching PDF articles, and word processing via Google Drive.Chromebook might be the right device for you IF you meet one or more of the following:- low or basic tech needs - internet browsing, use of online apps- already using Google products such as Gmail/familiarity with their products- basic use of word processing, spreadsheets, presentations- you will be in an area with free wifi whenever you plan to use this device (home, school, library, coffee shop, etc.)- you plan for Chromebook to be a supplementary or secondary device (read: you already have a computer or access to a computer at home)- you are open minded and willing to try new things!Chromebook is 2.4 pounds, has approximately 6 hours of battery life, and is fun and easy to use.  It is smaller than my clipboard and fits in my backpack right between my notebooks and textbooks.  The weight, long battery life, and quick boot and shutdown time (seriously, it is up and running in SECONDS) make this an awesome computer for students.Although Chromebook is extremely portable, it is not necessarily a good fit for a frequent traveler that does not have access to reliable wifi.  Nor is it a good fit for someone that actually NEEDS to run the full suite of Microsoft Office or other programs.  It is not a gaming laptop.  Let's be honest though, most people just use computers for email, web browsing, and visiting various social media sites.  If that sounds like you then I think you should give Chromebook a try!If you are a student, I highly recommend Chromebook as your primary machine for school.  If you really are worried about the fact that you will not have access to MS office or other specific programs then I recommend that you check with your school library or computer lab to see if the programs are available there.

While there isn't much horsepower under the hood, the components are a good fit for the ChromeOS vision.  Performance is snappy.  The form factor is small, light, and extremely portable.  I'm pleased with the build quality for the price (though it still won't compare with anything that costs 3x as much).  Touchpad works well and has some multi-touch functionality (e.g. 2-finger scrolling).  The keyboard has a well-designed layout (nothing really funky) and is comfortable to type on (comparable to the chiclet keyboard on my Vaio F Series as well as Macbook Air and Pro keyboards).I bought the Chromebook for grad school use in lieu of my 17 inch desktop replacement.  I'm a pretty heavy user of Google Drive (formerly Google Docs).  My use case is not tied to any software that requires a specific OS.  The Chromebook has been perfect for me for school use.  It's actually supplanted my Vaio for casual use when I don't need Windows-specific software or raw horsepower.  If you're interested in Ubuntu Linux, both Crouton and Chrubuntu are easy to install.While I love my Chromebook, there are areas which will hopefully be improved in successive models.  The screen is one of the lowest quality panels on any contemporary laptop.  This is expected at this price point, but it's the only thing that consistently reminds me that I'm using a sub-$250 device.  From an aesthetic standpoint, the hinge where the screen meets the laptop body is a bit ugly compared to higher-end laptops.  I'm happier that the hinge seems structurally sound and works well, but it is a small nitpick.Overall, I can't imagine being more pleased for such a low-priced computer.  There are definite limitations that should rule this computer out in many use cases, but it's a phenomenal value at what it does well.  If you're comfortable living almost entirely in the cloud, I don't know if there's a better value out there.  If you own a desktop or not-very-portable laptop and would like an ultraportable 2nd computer for light use, this Chromebook is a phenomenal complement.  If you want something cheap that won't be a disaster if it's lost, stolen, or dropped, $250 is about as little as you can pay for a computer.A little about myself:I'm a tech geek.  Between home and work, I've used a wide number of computers and devices.  I consider this Chromebook the best value of the devices I've owned.

I wanted to try it all, and see where my mobile needs led me.  Honestly, if I had bought this first, I'm not sure I would have bothered with the tablets.  Tablets are probably superior for games, and consuming entertainment media, which I can't do that much, due to limited internet access.  I love that I can sit on the porch and type away, or read the news, research topics of interest, and I don't have to hold the screen, as a tablet requires.  I didn't even bother to read the Quick Start Guide; the Chromebook just leads you along - and I'm barely tech literate.  As I needed to learn how to do things like Copy and Paste, access the Bookmarks bar, Zoom on the screen etc, I just 'Googled' my question to find the answer.  Google has made sure that detailed, clear and easy instructions are right there online, for all my questions so far.  I cannot believe that this tiny laptop was less than half the price of my 10 inch tablet.  I also bought a 32 GB SanDisk Cruzer Fit usb drive and it is so tiny you can barely see that it's inserted behind the hinge.  It's easy to be mobile with that little flash drive inserted - just leave it in.  I haven't tried an SD card yet, but I've read that it sticks out beyond the little door; too bad, it would be nice if it fit neatly inside, like a micro sd card does on a phone or tablet.  I am new to Googe Drive, but so far I love it.  I don't think I will use it for larger files like photos, because my internet is via my cell phone, and I have to watch my data consumption.  But for documents it's great; easy and accessible from all my devices.  All my old documents that happened to be in Google Docs magically appeared in the list!  Like old pals.  And even with Google Drive, you have the option of storing the documents on the usb drive.  The keyboard is a little harder touch than I'm used to, but I'm adapting quickly.  It's a nice keyboard; feels solid.  Battery life seems like it would be around 5 - 6 hours of continuous use.

If you're the type of person who uses a computer to browse on the internet, or you're just a big Google fan, then you are going to love the Chromebook. As a student, I don't bring my Chromebook to school because we're given cheap laptops to use. So, in terms of assignments and such, I use Google Drive to make documents like writing papers, essays, etc. This way I can start an assignment at school and without having to transport a laptop I can access and finish that same assignment at home on my Chromebook. Yes, you can do this with laptops other than the Chromebook, but I still wanted to make that point.  If you're looking for a laptop that has all the bells and whistles that an overpriced Apple product may provide, then you may want to reconsider the Chromebook. Before buying mine, I often found myself comparing the Samsung Chromebook with the Apple Macbook Air, even though I'm not an Apple fan (that's a whole other story) and the fact that these two laptops are in totally different leagues. I do admit, though, that the Apple Macbook Air is a very nice product in terms of design and what not, but it seemed that it had too much for what I really needed because I was just looking for a laptop that I could use to go on Facebook, check my email, etc. I did look at a few tablets, but I wanted to be able to do school work so a keyboard was definitely needed. Since my purchase, I've found that the Chromebook is really just a tablet with a keyboard which was perfect! Although dubbed a laptop, the Chromebook acts like a tablet due to the fact that you have applications, which you can easily access from the Chrome Web Store and/or Google Playstore, and it has limited space on the computer itself (although you can always store files on Google Drive). However, you can do things on the Chromebook that you can't on a tablet. For instance, my Dad owns a tablet and when trying to access Hulu, it requires that you have Hulu Plus to watch its content while the Chromebook doesn't have a problem. I know this may not be a defining factor in considering what you want, but for me that was pretty important.  When I first bought this laptop, Netflix initially didn't work on Chromebooks. Since then, the problem has been fixed and I've been using Netflix steadily for the past few months.  In terms of the laptop itself, and not on what it does, I've had absolutely no problems with the design. I really like the keyboard, where all letters are in lowercase (neat and different than those of other laptops), a search key replaces the standard caps lock key, and you have all the \"shortcut keys\" at the very top of the keyboard with options like full screen, brightness, sound, refresh button, and multiple tabs key. The keyboard is really nice, though my only complaint would be that the keys don't light up in the dark so if you're using the Chromebook in an area of limited light, then you have to use the light from the screen to see what you're typing. The mouse is really easy to use, you can scroll up and down pages by using two fingers on the mouse pad. The screen isn't glossy like the Macbook Air, but I found that its matte finish is much better because you don't have as much reflection on the screen. The speaker quality is pretty decent for its size and for having the speakers be on the bottom of the laptop (but the curvature design of the bottom makes it so it doesn't get too muffled). Although the laptop can be easily susceptible to scratches, it still has a sleek design and finish and I honestly don't mind the scratches on mine because I didn't buy it for what it looks like but more of what it can do.  There is a standard 3.5 mm audio input on the side with usb ports, hdmi cable port, and charger port on the back. There's also a decent front facing camera, but if you're one to take selfies, I advise that you use a cell phone or an actual camera if you want the best quality. The laptop is incredibly light and it really does turn on in less than 10 seconds, so if a restart is needed for an update and such, it doesn't take much time to do so.  SUMMARY: I didn't mean to go so in depth, but I honestly was so excited to write this review because I've been praising my Chromebook for the past 6 months and figured it was time to tell the world. If you are looking for a laptop primarily for internet use then don't look any farther because the Chromebook is perfect for you. It's light, and with a case you can take it just about anywhere. It really does turn on in about 8 seconds, so they weren't lying. The battery lasts for hours, so I don't need to recharge that often. However, because of its unique operating system and being heavily focused on using wi-fi, if you don't have wireless, then the Chromebook will be pretty useless. Yes, there are some offline apps you can use, but let me repeat, only some.  SUMMARY OF SUMMARY (this is it, I promise): Samsung claims that their Chromebook is for everyone but it definitely isn't. Before buying mine, I did a LOT of research and took a chance on the Chromebook and I have been very happy with it so far. I advise you to do some research on your own, and if you think that the Chromebook is right for you, then go for it.", "Date": "August 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect", "Author": "Pat Roberts", "ReviewID": "R3Q6VLMEROGD9M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Chromebook is  perfect for our needs.

I tried both the Samsung and Acer in store. My friend also had an Acer, which I used for a couple of days for about 4-hour periods.

The Windows 7 PC I could have trucked along with for a few more years, but the Windows 8 PC was a joke. Windows 8 looks so cool on the Surface commercials, but it's just ridiculous on a laptop. So I returned it after 2 weeks and bought my Chromebook just to tide me over till I could choose a 'real' PC and decide where to land in the new Windows landscape. I'll never go back. Windows 8 made me a Chromer for life. The first 2 weeks I had it I had to watch TV on it cause my TV got stole up too, and it was fantastic. Netflix and most of my U-verse online content looked great. Surprisingly, the sound was much better than the Windows 8 machine I'd had for a bit.If I could, I'd shave off like a 3rd of a star on account of there is no delete key. I really miss that and am not getting used to being without it.  I'd also nick that 5th star a bit for the action of the mouse 'buttons' embedded in the touchpad. You have to really bang them to activate, so selecting text is very awkward. I have to use my left hand to hold down the left mouse 'button' in order to select. But I am getting used to that. Also, weirdly, the camera APP that comes with the Chromebook, doesn't work. At all. Apparently everyone knows that and the solution is to just go to the play store and get a new one. It's almost like you're being set up to see how easy it is to replace software compared to a PC. I was alarmed at first that something so fundamental didn't work; but 10 seconds later, when I had a new app that worked perfectly, I was sold on the Chromebook.Overall, I love it and am perfectly happy with the Google Drive universe.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for students! I'm really impressed!", "Author": "Michelle Webb", "ReviewID": "R13X065OYB9NQG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So I'm a busy college student who who was looking for a laptop that wouldn't cost me a fortune. Being a student, I was looking for something that was easy to throw in my backpack, had a long battery life, and was easy to take notes with (with a word processor or slide presentation). After having the Samsung Chromebook for about a week, I have to say that so far I'm really impressed.Specifically, I've been really impressed with how the Chromebook has performed. I've been carrying it around in my backpack and have used it during all of my lectures. The battery lasts a lot longer than I was expecting, even with the screen set on the highest brightness setting, the battery has lasted the entire school day (around 5-6 hours).Keep in mind that for $230, you have to sacrifice a few things. There is very little internal memory, but with Google Drive and/or a flash drive, this is something that shouldn't be a deal breaker. Also, it does take a little bit of time to get used to the Google operating system if you haven't used it before, but after only a week I already am feeling pretty comfortable with it. I have used Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calender for a few years now, so the transition was pretty smooth. If you aren't very well acquainted with these Google products, then this product might not be for you since it is powered by these apps.If you are a hardcore gamer, photographer, or are into some other computer-dependent hobby, then be weary of buying a Chromebook since a lot of games/programs that you may want to download might not be compatible with a Chrome Operating system.The take home message: if you consider yourself somewhat tech savvy and don't mind getting used to a new operating system, then get the Samsung Chromebook! I am very happy with my purchase and don't have any regrets!", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price, not for everyone", "Author": "Emileigh", "ReviewID": "R2OHQLH0OJ93FJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my disabled sister who lives with me.  The Chromebook looked good to replace my old iBook which she used for email and looking at photos from her son who lives across country.  However the iBook had no camera, and she will shortly be a grandmother, so \"perfect, this has a web cam\" and she can do video conferencing.  I have a Samsung Galaxy 10.1 tablet, like it and it does web conferencing so this seemed to be a great solution.The first Chromebook that was shipped was horrible.  The net speed was terrible (.2 MB/S download) and a search on the internet showed that this was a systemic problem.  However after more research including a lot of Speedtest sessions, it was clear this one had a hardware problem, and Amazon exchanged it overnight.  The new one works just fine for what we intended it to do.The Pros are:- Price is definitely good.  Even my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 cost more.- Size and weight is perfect.I might just buy another for traveling and leave my Viao at home.- Keyboard has nice sized keys that are well marked.  Very nice for a senior.- Graphics quality is very good for something so small.  The screen is nice and bright- Apps - they are just what you need though more on that later- Performance.  Even though it's a slightly slower processor, there is a GPU that takes off some of the load- Tweaks.  You can use quite a few tweeks to Chrome if you do some research in the forums.- Dual Band WiFi - nice to have it on a 5.6Ghz channel then the crowded 2.4Ghz- Battery Life seems to be really good, about 10 hours more or less- WebCam resolution and response are very goodThe Cons are:- It's not windows (and this seems to be a lot of complaints, though not mine)- The Wifi range isn't great - I have a 3000 ft/sq ranch and it can't go to the side opposite the house to the router.  I had to install a second wireless gateway in her room - no biggie but not expected.- Power management.  Its good, but if you put it to sleep it doesn't give you any alerts because it turns off the WiFi connection and can't get calls.  There is an app that will let you work around this however.- Keyboard (minor).  I think this is also a ChromeOS problem, but to do things like cap's lock you have to remember a keyboard shortcut.- Google's ChromeOS (generally - see my comments)- No Skype.  Most business folks won't appreciate this omission.- No printing without Cloudprint (which I don't like, I shouldn't have to go to the outside of my workgroup to print.)ChromeOS seems to me to be quite immature compared to Android, and I wonder if the two teams at Google ever talk to each other.  While Android (4.04) on my Galaxy is polished and sleek, ChromeOS feels clunky and reminds me of a mashup between Mac OSX (which I think was 10.0) and Windows 95. Except there is no concept of shortcuts that you can put on the desktop.  It took a while for Android to improve, and hopefully ChromeOS will too. Or maybe it will be replaced with Android.  If not, my understanding is I can have options to hack in any one of three different linux distributions.Other notes on Apps:Mail - nice and familiar GMail client.Video Conferencing - not good at all.  It relies on Google Hangouts which no one likes (sorry google - GMail Talk was better)  Skype is easy to use and Hangouts are not.  It's really that simple.Office Apps - light but nice for most users.  MS Office is far too bloated now IMHOSUMMARY:  On the whole, if you are on a budget and  want a light weight, compact netbook with good video and ergonomics, this is the one to buy.  If you are a poweruser with a need for speed, you should probably consider paying more for a top end Chromebook or a machine from Apple or running Windows.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price!", "Author": "Brianna", "ReviewID": "R2Y29P7IMZSSMC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really enjoy this chrome book.

It still does word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations and stores them locally.  There is no disk drive to fragment or to fail.Because the Chrome OS really lives on the Web, it is automatically updated without intervention from you.  It is invulnerable to viruses.  So you do not need to have antivirus software slowing you down and emptying your wallet.  It automatically saves all documents as you work.  You cannot fail to save something.  Software updates, both OS and applications, are free and automatic.It is not going to run your Windows or MacOS or Linux software.

I'm still exploring apps but there appear to be plenty of useful ones. It charges quickly and the charge lasts a considerable time. The sound is adequate and fine when externally connected. It is not as sturdy as most laptops so one has to be a little careful with handling. I've read that pressure on the plastic top can crack the screen so I just don't sit anything on it or squeeze it. I don't think for my purposes that it will completely replace my laptop but, for the price, it is a handy and convenient tool and I don't have to lug my laptop around.

It resembles a cheaper MAC Book (Imagine that!).Display quality overall is pretty nice.100GB of Google Drive space for 2 years (this is a promotion).Fanless cooling.  It's 100% silent.Comfortable to type on.Cons:Battery life is short in my opinion.  I get about 3-4 hours of continuous use, I expected more.No illuminated keyboard (personal preference, but would've been nice).Video playback can be choppy at times.

I own a dell studio 15 and I was getting tired of lugging it around and having to fight for tables with outlets when studying at a coffee shop, or only getting an hour's work done before it died. I needed something smaller, lighter, and with a better battery life. While I would love a macbook air, I'm not in a position to spend $1200 for a device at this time. That's when I started looking at Chromebooks. The only hangup I had was that I had to be online to get any use out of it, and then I realized that I am always online. It takes a little bit to get it set up the way I wanted it but after that it does everything I need it to, I can even access my iCloud account online and update my to do list and calendar.  Well, almost. There are certain test that I have to take for school that I need a regular PC for, and then there is my iTunes account. For those I use my laptop at home. Even then I can remotely access my computer from anywhere. I love writing on it, the keyboard is very good. I used it on a trip to DC, and was able to get work done on the train gong up and back. The fact that I usually only charge it at night like a cell phone is a plus.  I will warn anyone who is considering buying one that this is not for those who need to replace their powerful PC, the lack of significant hardrive space and Chrome's limited OS will frustrate someone coming from a Macbook pro or other $1000 computer. This is for those who are already comfortable working in the cloud, or need a small, light, second computer with a great battery. If that's you then I highly recommend it.  As far as word processing goes, I have a skydrive account. I can access all of my documents, open them with the online version of Microsoft office. I'm a creature of habit and I don't like Google docs for daily use. I'm not really big photo social media guy, I only use Linked in and Facebook so I cannot speak to that for anyone. If I listen to music I use Google play and synced all of my iTunes music to it so I have access to everything I own. I rarely use the speakers, I prefer headphones as I am often out in public. I don't watch movies on the Chromebook, I only watch lectures for school and they are usually of poor video quality to begin with. If I'm gonna watch a movie I'll watch it on my HD tv at home, never really understood the need to watch movies on tiny screens. (I know I'm a boring old man).

I think it looks beautiful and its also very light. I did a lot of research on this product, and I know it is a web based system. Really all I do on my main computer is use Google chrome to do all my homework and access apps. I never use exe files at all all my resources are readily available online. So this Chromebook is a plus. I think it is great to carry around in your backpack at school and I am hoping it can last for the next four years. It seems pretty durable even though it is plastic. I love the matte screen because it reduced glare and fingerprinting. It literally looks like a Mac book air from far away. It really does! I really like that as well. I would recommend this product as a secondary computer to use for travel and school work and bringing on the go. You should also have your main computer, like pc mac or something, because I don't think the Chromebook qualifies as a main computer. It is like a tablet but better. On the ipad you cant view like flash stuff but on the Chromebook, it is an ACTUAL browser. This Samsung Chromebook is going to be very useful for me because I use google apps such as Google Drive (the most), google search, chrome, youtube alot. And also other web apps like turnitin and Engrade. I can access online textbooks with no problem. I can use this in the library after school because my school library computers are often always all full after school.

I previously had a Macbook Air that recently died a bit prematurely, so I thought I would give this Chromebook a shot.Firstly, I really like the size of the laptop.  It's very small and lightweight, and yet the keyboard and trackpad feel really good.  I am very picky about my laptop trackpads, having been spoiled by my Air.  Most Windows laptops have horrible trackpads and I was very concerned about going to this one.  However, the accuracy is excellent and the gestures are pretty good.  I don't think they are quite up to par with the Macs, but for this price point the trackpad is better than Windows laptops that are three times this price.As far as the operating system itself, color me impressed.  I was a user of Google Chrome already and heavily invested into Google web apps, so that transition wasn't hard at all.  I did find myself looking for some viable Chrome-based alternatives to software that I used on my PC, like a VNC client.  To date, I haven't found a single piece of software that I need on a daily basis on a laptop that doesn't have a Chrome app for it.The only negative thing I can say is that the ARM processor in this guy can sometimes get a little sluggish on graphically intensive pages, but mostly it's smooth.  High definition video is just fine most of the time, but some pages can still slow it down to a crawl.  I have tweaked a couple of settings and blocked some web elements from loading and that seemed to improve it greatly.  I definitely recommend this Samsung Chromebook and Chrombooks in general.

First of all, I have never really owned anything by Samsung. Actually, I thought Samsung was quite inferior to the other brands out there, but I will say that my opinion has changed completely. A month ago I was experiencing some problems with my desktop so I bought this Chromebook as a cheap solution...and I absolutely love it. It is very lightweight. I love that it doesn't have any fans, so there is no fear of it overheating. I've not had any trouble logging onto any websites. Believe me, I'll let Netflix play all night and I have not had any issues with the it cutting off at all. The volume is very very nice. The screen is average. The size is great for handling.The keys are soundless. Every now and then the Chromebook will shutdown on its own in order to update everything, but it's very rare and it saves absolutely everything. Unfortunately, my only real complaint about the Chromebook is that the cover must have been made out of very cheap material because I've only had it for a month and there are scratches all over the top. However, Samsung sells these really cool protective skins. I found some at Decalgirls.com for like 20 bucks and they work really really well. (AND NO, THEY AREN'T JUST FOR GIRLS< YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEM HOWEVER YOU LIKE). I would not advise an older, working individual to buy one simply because this is more fit for college students. It is no different from an Ipad, but you cannot treat it as an apple product. Samsung WILL NOT cooperate with Itunes, but you already know that. Of course, you need the internet for absolutely everything on it. As a college student, I need the internet daily anyways so that isn't an issue for me.  All in all, the Samsung Chromebook is cheap, yet has great features on it.

I am using a netbook that I bought 3 years ago, using WinXP,and it has slowed down badly over time.  Can't even play Youtube videos without stuttering any more, sometimes to the point where I give up trying to watch.  If the chromebook can deliver a device that won't have that problem, I'd love it.  So that's why I bought it.  The execution of the idea, I found, has a couple issues.  First, I had some difficulties with the keyboard and trackpad.  And then I found out that the particular device I had is defective.  Those two issues are discussed in more detail, in the next two paragraphs.I only used this device for a few hours last evening, when it functioned normally.  It was pretty nice then, with a nice bright screen and everything very intuitive and easy to use.  On the downside, I thought the cursor movement in response to the trackpad was a bit slow, even after I found the \"settings\" and set it for max speed.  Also, Chrome doesn't seem to have a setting that makes the cursor fly all the way to the edge of a window once you have set it in motion, which you get with Windows.  The cursor only moves as long as your finger is in contact with the trackpad and moving.  However, the trackpad does have 2-finger scrolling, and a tap with 2 fingers gives you a \"right click,\" which are nice features.  I was going to keep the device and study up on all the features, and I figured it would get easier for me to use with practice on this particular keyboard and trackpad.Unfortunately, this morning I discovered that my unit is defective.  On the third boot-up, the trackpad had stopped working.  The cursor would barely respond, if at all, to finger movements across the trackpad.  Samsung customer service is good, BTW (this is my 2d Samsung laptop).  I got them on the phone, and these were the troubleshooting steps they had me try:  (1) re-boot - which I had already tried before phoning them, (2) tap the \"escape\" key several times - no change there (3) do a \"drumroll\" with two fingers on the trackpad - no joy (4) do a factory reset, using the following keys, held down together:  Shift - Ctrl - Alt - R.  After the factory reset (which the Chromebook calls a \"powerwash\") the trackpad became responsive for a minute or two.  But before I could even get back to connecting with my wifi, it cut out again.Bottom line:  I would have liked to use this device for a longer period of time before reviewing it.  Based on what I was able to do with it, I felt it was about a 3 - 4 because of my criticisms of the keyboard and trackpad that I wrote in paragrah 2.  In light of the defect in this example of the system, I'm going with 3 stars.  I'll send this back for refund, and apply the money to getting a PC or Mac.  I'm glad there is a 3d choice out there now, but at the moment I guess it is not for me.Edit, later on: I didn't get the device packed up and sent back right away, so I gave it one more chance last evening. Starting over from the most recent reset to factory settings, I used it to edit text, happily, for a few hours. I take back what I said about \"not enough travel in the keys.\" I seem to have adjusted, and the typing was OK. BUT, once the power got low enough for the device to prompt me to plug it in - bam, as soon as I plugged in the power supply, the trackpad stopped working properly again.

This feels like it weighs less than most of my tablets (Asus Transformer Prime, iPad2) and packs just as easily as any of them.4) The speed in which it connects is fast -- no matter where I go.5) I received 100Gb of additional space on Google DriveThe bad:1) There is a slight noise in the trackpad area where my wrist rests. It sounds like it pops up and down -- but this is intermittent and hasn't even happened in a week.2) I have had some trouble finding a few networks when I've traveled -- networks that I can find on my phone and/or tablets. In one case I gave up and just used the TPrime with the attached keyboard.Overall, I would highly recommend this computer if you use Google products extensively, if you use the internet extensively, and/or if you do not need proprietary software installed on your laptop.

It's a very similar experience from my MacBook Air -- chiclet style keys with a good \"pop.\" The only downside is that the shortcut keys on the top row are arranged different from my MBA. I find myself accidentally hitting the 'back' and 'forward' button on the Chromebook while trying to dim the screen and so on.My Favorites:Music/Cloud SyncDuring my undergrad years I was a huge music snob (oh university radios) and had accumulated tons of music. It was a nightmare trying to transfer them whenever I would upgrade laptops. I tried lugging around a external HDD large enough, but found myself defeating the whole point of having a laptop. I was really glad when Google Music offered 20,000 songs (I was at about 19,000, I hope they'll allow more in the future) as I can have access to my music collection wherever I go. The Google Music App with my iPhone works well with my unlimited Data plan from StraightTalk.. I really don't know the last time I actually synced music files onto it! I do notice that the music player plug in will crash on the Chromebook if I pause and resume too quickly.Apple's iDrive or iCloud or ... iWhatever was always so confusing to me. 'Oh it's called iDrive now? Wait now I have 10gb allotted for pictures? Huh?' whereas Google it just synced everything on its own. I was fortunate enough to have a Legacy Plan so I'm not worried on running out of space any time soon. Also the additional 100GB/2years included was a pleasant surprise. The best part was that the Google Drive space is independent of my music collection! I'm a hobby photographer so it's nice to know that my pictures are safe floating around in the cloud space.I dug around and found that my Legacy plan will stay intact after the 2 years, and if I have accessed the free 100GB, those files will still be available with the caveat that I won't be able to add more files to my Gdrive. Unless I pay for additional space of course.I have an iPhone that I changed to use Chrome by default via Cydia. I love that it syncs all my bookmarks and surfing history across my gear. I briefly had a Nexus 4, but had to stick with the iPhone because most of my medical software are on iOS only. It wasn't a preference of brands, I just want convenience as my backpack gets more full with each new gadget out on the market!Documents/Office ProductivityI also find myself no longer dependent on thumb drives. I work as a researcher for a hospital so I'm constantly hopping back and forth free computers to enter in data or make corrections. We recently made the jump to Google Docs so that we can all edit documents simultaneously. Before this, if someone had left a certain document open on the network, others would not be able to edit it. A huge hassle as a witch hunt would ensue to find which \"n00b\" left the document open. Oh lab grunts.Cons:Netflix/AVI playbackLike others have mentioned, Netflix is still not available on this certain model. I hope it gets fixed soon!AVI playback seems hit or miss for meConclusion:So I had bought this on a whim, the price tag was really appealing and I bought it as a toy. Little did I know it would become part of my professional life.I wish I had waited for the 3G model, 100mb/month doesn't seem much but I could see it being extremely handy in a cinch. I was waiting for a flight back home at LaGuardia where the only option was to pay for Boingo.

I make my living off the Internet and was working within 5 minutes of taking my SC out of the box. I can't add anything more than all the previous posters have so I'll leave a few tips & tricks:ALT + backspace is the delete keyIf Hulu is jerky set Hulu to HIGH, not HD or AUTO. Netflix is on the way. YouTube works fine.The screen is fine - gets better with use. If you stand to either side of the SC or hang from your chandelier you can't see the image but I don't stand to the side and I hate chandeliers so I sit in front of all my devices and in that position the screen on the SC is fine. It would be nice if Sammy or Google would add a contrast slider as that would bring out the image.I never liked standalone progs so have been in the cloud before it was named the cloud. I put everything up on Google Drive and it all seems to work fine - films stream okay on the SC, music sounds good, images look cool, docs appear as they should. Put Google Drive on all your devices and you'll have global access to all your stuff. I haven't used SD cards, thumb drives, etc on the SC as I'll either temporarily copy something over (like a film I want to watch on a trip somewhere) or leave it on the Drive.Sound is good - I think the SC has a spatializer because it gives a surround sound effect out of 2 small speakers. Sound is really good with headphones or through a speaker systemA light touch on the touch pad works for me - real gentle. Once you get used to using 2 fingers for certain options you'll be zipping around.Connection to WiFi was instant for me - I know some have had problems. I set up my printer connected to my Windows desktop on Google Cloud Print a few months ago during an idle moment so was pleasantly surprised when I was able to print immediately from my SC.It's cute but it's plastic so keep that in mind if you're going out & about and don't leave it anywhere it can be sat on. My Sammy netbook could probably take being sat on, my Sammy Chromebook - well, I think not, so be warned.That's all I can think of. The SC is a fabulous new way of computing for those of us that live online and don't need exe progs. I can't recommend it highly enough.

I'm using it even more often than I thought I would.  I have a high end desktop with a linux OS, a Dell laptop with Win7, a Nexus 7 and this Chromebook.  So far, the Chromebook is getting the most use.  The form factor, long battery life, full-fledged browser, and instant on make this device more compelling than the others.  I had considered buying a MacBook Air to use as a \"couch computer\" but this one does the job for a quarter of the price.  Note that I didn't say it does everything the Air does, because it doesn't, but it does all the things I was going to do with the Air.I think it's better to compare this Chromebook to mobile devices rather than to a full-fledged laptop, even though I'm using it more like a laptop.  That opinion may change over time as more HTML5 capabilities are utilized on the net, but even as a mobile device, this beats every tablet out there.  It has a nice keyboard, a very nice trackpad, full-fledged applications (I'm so sick of truncated browsers and email apps on Android and IOS), and a large screen that's much better than I expected, given some of the feedback I've read.One other plus - the 100GB of space on Google Drive for two years is worth almost half the asking price of this little machine.The only downside I see to this is the limited capability of web apps.  Like I said before, that may change, but until then, I don't think I could live with this being my only computer.  I need vector and bitmap drawing programs, sound editing, desktop publishing, etc.  These are robust apps and while they do have web based counterparts, that functionality is limited by bandwidth and feature sets.Over all, I'm VERY happy with my new Chromebook, and I'm looking forward to the changes that will be coming for Chrome OS in the future.", "Date": "December 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Product is not satisfactory for normal day to day use - Update", "Author": "WILLIAM G MEYERS", "ReviewID": "R38GAC6J5ZDE7M", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I like the concept of using the web for applications.

I wanted to wait until I'd had it awhile to write a review. While I do wish it had more than one standard USB port, the webcam isn't the greatest and of all things, I sometimes miss the delete key but overall, I really like this computer. I use it a lot, take it everywhere and have rarely had any trouble with it and what trouble I've had has never been anything that couldn't be solved by closing some tabs or, at the most, restarting it. It has no problem picking up wi-fi signals most anywhere I am and that's been really helpful, much more so than trying to work on my phone.It's incredibly light and compact. As others have said because it has a solid state hard drive, there's no fan, so it's also incredibly quiet and while it does get warm during extended use, even if I'm using it all day, it never gets as hot as previous laptops did after even short periods of use. It keeps my lap about as warm as the average house cat, as opposed to burning my legs after twenty minutes.I frequently watch Netflix on my Chromebook. It keeps up, even if I have other tabs open. Usually, if anything goes wrong, it's Netflix and not the Chromebook. I've notice YouTube will occasionally get glitchy if I try to multitask while watching a video. The same can be said of Bandcamp but as far as streaming music from my Google Drive while typing or doing research, it usually works without any trouble. That said, the cloud storage aspect took some getting used to. I've learned to use the Scratchpad (Chrome OS equivalent of WordPad in Windows) rather than Google Docs to get my ideas out, so that I can access stuff even if I don't have internet and then when things are closer to being finalized, I use Docs to format everything and do my final drafts. With Sync, it uploads my Scratchpad files to my drive, so I can access them from my phone and other computers, as well.The app system is pretty good. I've yet to pay for an app and I have been able to find most anything I could need and install it quickly. There are lots of similar apps, so sometimes it's a matter of trying two or three and seeing which suits my needs. Some run internally, others open in the browser and connect online. Some of the latter can take awhile to load. It's not dissimilar to Android in that way. For all I know about computers and smartphones, it could be exactly the same.If anyone has any questions, I'd be happy to do my best to answer them.

It's a very sharp looking little machine. As everyone says, you open it up, and it automatically starts right up in no time at all. No bloated and expensive operating system to load here. The screen size suits me fine, and the sound is okay. There's only 16G of storage, but with with an SD card slot and two USB connections, you really have as much storage as you need. Need more storage? Just buy another SD card.It's Google-centric of course, so you're automatically signed into all your Google accounts - gmail, youtube, drive and so on. Obviously, nothing is truly secure and private in the cloud, but I find using Drive for writing documents to be extremely convenient. No need to worry about losing anything, it's always up there in the cloud. I can get to my documents from my phone, my Nexus, or any connected computer, anywhere I go. You can also work on your documents if you happen to be offline, and it will auto-save locally and update to the cloud as soon as you're connected again. Again, really convenient.Like most people, I often use my computer to surf the net. I've been using Chrome for a long time, and it works well on the Chromebook, naturally. It's also easy to view photos with the Chromebook, whether your pictures are on an SD card, or on the Chromebook drive.As quickly as the Chromebook starts, it's just as quick shutting down. No need to twiddle your thumbs waiting for the OS to do its housekeeping. So far, the battery seems to be more than adequate. No problem there.So far, the only negative (and the only reason for just 4 stars) is printing. I haven't been able to get my Chromebook to work with my printer, and I don't think Cloud printing will be of any use for me. If I could print with my Chromebook, it's an easy 5 stars.

I'm currently using it for web browsing, email, and simple image processing, but this fall, I took it with me on a cross USA bicycle tour where I also used it to create web pages - 45 of them - on the crazyguyonabike.com web site. Without wifi, I used Pixlr Touch Up to edit and re-size images for my web pages and Text to create the text for the pages. Then, when I had wifi, I used Chrome to upload the text and images and edit the web pages after crazyguy  created them using my images and text.My tour was from North Carolina to California. Roughly in the middle of the tour, in Norton, Kansas, I dropped my Chromebook. I was in line at a McDs, getting a snack. My Chromebook was tucked under my left arm. Ir slipped out and fell about four feet to the tile floor. It hit on one corner, bounced several times and clattered to rest on the floor. As I picked it up, some one said \"Did it break?\" and I replied, \"I don't know.\" After I got my snack and sat down. I opened it and saw no damage, so I turned it on and used it to check my email.After I got to my motel that night. I noticed that many of the clips that hold the the plastic shells around both the display and the main part of the computer were opened. I carefully worked around both shells, pressing them back together and all of the  clips that were open clicked back into place. The only damage I could fine was a little marring, about 1/4\" wide, on the front left corner. I don't think any of the many laptop computers I have owned, including several Toughbooks, would have survived that fall with so little damage.Since I use it for photo editing, I wish it had more accurate color rendering on its display. Since I camp sometimes on tour and may be away from power outlets for several days, I also wish it had a swap-able battery so I could carry a spare. Its battery is replaceable, but that requires removing the bottom shell and unscrewing six screws which I wouldn't want to do on tour. Battery life is good - around six hours - and I carry an Anker external battery brick which can power the Chrome book for another four or five hours. That is good enough for me to create several days of web pages off line when I am camping.", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Awesome Laptop I no Longer need Windows PCs", "Author": "Tony Coppola", "ReviewID": "R1YUCVXP7A790K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you use Google chrome as your browser you will be a big fan of this Laptop.

The cheap hardware is a problem:  some keys stick, other keys have to be pushed extra hard, typing too fast makes it jump to another page, overheats in a few hours and locks up.  It's streamlining means it's missing some keys; you have to remember and use combinations instead.  This includes the delete key--kind of an important key for me--very irritating!  When it gets hot after a few hours, weird things happen, s.a. when I use the touchpad, the whole page moves instead of just the cursor; the cursor keeps changing shape and function on its own; can't scroll up and down; finally it freezes and google has to reboot.  This is the worst computer I've ever owned!  Speed is its best quality, but that doesn't count for much when I have to turn it off because it keeps freezing.

My initial thoughts were something along the lines of \"How am I going to survive with only the internet,\" and \"How can I live without Skype?!?\" I used Skype for daily communication, so when my PC broke, I was devastated. No matter what my initial thoughts were, I love this Chromebook. Whether using it to speed through essays with it's super-comfortable keyboard, or browsing the web at speeds faster than any of my computers prior, I do not regret my purchase in the least.Compatibility-  For those of you worried about losing your Microsoft Office, don't be. While it does not run it, the Chromebook comes packed with Google Drive, an office suite I find just as capable as MS Office. Everything is stored in the cloud (Which you get 100 gigabytes extra for free in, by the way) by Google, so I feel my data won't get blown away by server errors. For the gamers out there, this does not run ANY programs other than the web browser and its various extensions. However, you can still do a lot with it. (See Productivity)Productivity-  Is it possible to be productive on a Chromebook? In my experience, yes. As a matter of fact, I found myself more productive on a Chromebook, as I had less distractions in all. As I've said, Google Drive comes bundled, along with 100 GB free of cloud storage. It may be a bit more difficult to be productive offline, but this is solved with the 3G model. You are never offline. Verizon offers up 100 MB of free 3G- which is more than enough for me, considering I almost never leave my router.Form Factor-  The Chromebook is light, and slim too. As a student, the last thing I need are more things weighing down my bookbag- and with the Chromebook, I can drop it in my bookbag without worry. It is extremely easy to carry, and I absolutely love the keyboard. It is comfortable, sleek, and due to it's island-style, I make many less typos. Also- I get around 9-12 hours of battery life out of this thing with the brightness set low. That is AMAZING.Conclusion-  If you are a student that only needs the web, go for it. If you are an adult that mainly uses Facebook and checks your bank account- get it. The only demographic I wouldn't recommend it to would be gamers. For the rest of the population, there may be minor drawbacks, but since there is a suitable image editor on the Chromebook, nearly everyone should be fine.The battery life is phenomenal, so it's perfect for people who are always on the go.

I boxed it up and sent it in, and within a week I had it back in full working order. The entire process cost me nothing. The system was wiped, so when I powered it up it was the screen that pops up when first purchasing the device, but that's part of the beauty of a Chromebook. All I needed to do was log in, and the whole thing loaded up exactly as if nothing had happened (minus a few files I had stored on the hard drive, but that is to be expected after a hard reset.)I've owned a handful of Samsung devices in the past, but this was the first time I'd needed a repair. The experience was completely painless from start to finish, and much quicker than I could have expected.One other thing, I won't be re-installing Ubuntu. I've set the \"Chrome Remote Desktop\" application to mirror my PC, and it is a really, really seamless experience, so for the few times I need to use Firefox, I use that app in the Chrome OS.

Very clean design with round edges.- Light as well. I can see myself carrying this around with one hand easily.- Decent-sized and responsive keypad. This is easily a deal-maker.- Nice and big trackpad. Supports multi-touch.- Chrome Web Store has plenty of apps to do whatever you want.Cons: (let's keep in mind that this is a $150-200 notebook)- Screen lacks contrast, saturation and has a rather narrow viewing angle.- Trackpad is just nice, not great. Limited multi-touch gestures.- A little slow. Maybe it's ChromeOS, maybe it's the hardware. But doesn't run as smooth as I'd like it to.- Just web apps. But hey, it's a Chromebook.

And at $250, it sounded perfect for me.A little about me: I bought a 1st-gen Kindle Fire last spring, and I love that for reading and light web-browsing on the go. Then last summer I got a Samsung Galaxy S3, and that basically took over for my Kindle, except for being able to read books (I probably should have just gone with a cheaper kindle then...). But neither the Kindle Fire nor the S3 give me good web browsing abilities.So far, this Chromebook fits my needs very well. It's small, it's light, it has surprisingly nice speakers, and WOW, it's so QUIET!! I'm also surprised at how FAST it boots up. Even from being completely powered off. And how fast it shuts down! Really nice. No more waiting for programs to load in the background!!I've never used a Chiclet keyboard before, so this is my first time using one (and it's a little difficult. Most keyboards I use are more cramped than this. For example, I think the \"backspace\" key is kind of far away, so I keep hitting the equals sign accidentally). The trackpad could be better.

Since I couldn't really afford anything, I got the Chromebook on a whim about a week ago.  Tonight I was forced to learn how to use it quickly after my Macbook died and I lost the paper I was working on.  I found an emailed version, uploaded it into Google Docs, hooked up the Chromebook to my WiFi printer (Epson Workforce 645), and I am very pleased.  The brightness and quality of display, as well as the included apps had me pleasantly delighted.  The Chrome store is also pretty fun to look through, and has many apps that I already use on my Macbook (incl. Dropbox, which has all my school docs).  It plays video well so far, and apparently is also capable of sharing remote desktop to another computer, and uploading iTunes libraries into its native music player.

This is a new interpretation of that. I am reviewing this for someone who has no idea what a Chromebook is or who it is for.A Chromebook in some ways is similar to a tablet with a made in keyboard. Chromebook has a very small operating system that you can't break, doesn't get viruses and essentially updates itself.  What you get in that simplicity is basically no maintenance-- great for those who know very little about computers, tend to always get infected with spyware, those who may not be tech-savvy, etc. and only need to get online for email, internet browsing, youtube playing-- the normal basics.What you get more than a tablet is a full regular keyboard and touchpad. You get a browser and all of the Google Apps family of \"Microsoft Office equivalents\" of documents, spreadsheet, and others. You get access to the Chrome store for other web-apps. You won't get everything here, but the store is expanding rapidly.What you get less than a PC is that you can't install Windows applications and some offline applications that work without an internet connection. The Chromebook is really the true 'netbook. It expects an internet connection at almost all times to be most useful and enjoyable.Let's not joke: this thing is super cheap. And in many ways looks like an 11.6\" Macbook Air. If you're on an absolute budget and can only afford this Chromebook, it is quite sleek and adequate for the money. That being said if you're a premium hardware snob you'll be disappointed-- the touchpad is not nearly as sensitive as a premium (or Apple) touchpad, it has a hollow cheap-ish click and the keyboard is a bit hollow. That being said, if you are new to computers, don't be bothered by those descriptions: You'll only notice those drawbacks if you've already tasted the sweet nectar of a premium high end laptop that's build from metal.This one is built with plastic and it feels like it was intentionally imaged after the Macbook Air 11.6\" or other Ultrabooks. This is a good thing. The unit is slim in most aspects and is quite visually appealing compared to other Chromebooks. The charger brick is tiny. The charging jack is tiny. The battery life is very good but the horsepower under the hood is light-- don't expect to have 20 tabs open in Chrome and get great performance.This is Chromebook reloaded-- and it's clearly moving in the right direction. They have a concept Chrome operating system and that idea of limited but bulletproof will entice some and turn off others. Either you're in or your not. Once you're in, the appearance and design matter, and that's where this evolution is compared to previous Chromebooks.I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 for the hollow touchpad and hollow keyboard feeling. I also had to return my first one because the device kept locking up. That was a random fluke bad unit and I didn't detract for that because a lifetime of tech purchases has told me that even the best have occasional failures.If you're just looking to touch your toes in the Chromebook, this is my recommended option.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "GimpyK", "ReviewID": "R2GSQ7RBMK2IQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband just surprised me with a chromebook for my birthday.

Therefore, no things like Skype until Google decides they want to add it, if ever.- The power button is right above the backspace, and right were delete usually is, so dont miss! ;)- The mouse pad, and clicker are one thing, therefore, if you are using 1 finger to navigate, and the other to click, you may end up moving the mouse in two different directionsThe ugly:Nothing yet... it's pretty sleek lookin!Verdict (TL/DR) - It's a great laptop.  The size and weight make it insanely portable, but also make it feel like it is not very tough, so you are likely to have to take good care of it in your travels.  The Google OS doesnt fail as hard as I was assuming it would have, but it does severely limit the point of having a laptop.  For those of you who want a laptop, and plan to use it a lot for Skype, dont get a Chromebook.  However, if you are more of a Google Hangouts person, it should be fine for you.

This Chromebook has achieved a remarkable market position when one considers the combination of its competitive price-point, seamless cloud-based performance and battery life, and appealing hardware design that makes even the $999 low-end MacBook Air look like a massive rip-off.Yes, Samsung's XE303C12 does not (yet- see Gmail Offline) run well-known applications from its local storage, and privacy may be a concern with its cloud-based storage of user data.

The convenience gain: data backup and operating system maintenance procedures are now automatic and free-of-charge, and damage or theft to your computer will not result in major data loss. Just change your Google password and buy another reasonably-priced $249 Chromebook and your worries are minimized.

This Chromebook is fantastic in every way, shape and form. The only thing that I have not been able to do with it is log in to an enterprise Microsoft Sharepoint server, but that is not a huge deal to me. I have been able to do almost anything else I would ever want to do with it. I use it every night to use Google Video Chat with my girlfriend, and the only issues I see with that are typically when the internet is slow. Nothing client-based.Logmein and Chrome Remote Desktop make for fantastic remote desktop solutions, and both work very well on the Chromebook. That is great for me because a 17.6\" gaming laptop is heavy to carry around, so if I must use Windows then I can always remote in to it from anywhere. It also helps to know that (finally) Logmein is working on an extension for Google Chrome, in case that is an important service for you.I have not had any issues with pages loading on the Chromebook. They all seem to work as they are supposed to. Even though it runs on a mobile processor, I do not notice any lag or anything like that even with 1080p video playback. Boot time is consistently under 10 seconds and time to resume from sleep is virtually instantaneous.If you are an avid user of Google services, then the Chromebook will work great for you. I use Google Drive quite frequently and the free 100gb comes in handy for me. It is great to use Google Docs when I am on the run because I can resume my work anywhere from any computer. The only issue I have with that is when typing its equivalent of a Word Document, you cannot merge cells in a table. Oh well.Battery life is great too, with an average of 6 hours on general web browsing, 4.5 for video chat.If there is anything you need to do on a Windows computer, more than likely there is a free web-based solution. For that matter, I even found a web-based alternative to Photoshop!Unlike many operating systems, updates are not something you have to think about anymore.

The Chromebook satisfied all of my desires for a super-fast functional netbook so well that when my parents' desktop PC broke down, I knew precisely what to buy them for my father's 60th - this newer Chromebook.After setting it up for them - a doddle really, enter the password for your wireless connection and ensure you have a Google account and that's it - I showed them how easy it was to use. Simply open or close the Chromebook's lid to turn it on and off. Boot speed is literally seconds. Updates are necessary though these are few and far between and also take literally seconds to update. And browsing is completely straightforward - Chrome looks simpler as a browser than IE.Comparing my Chromebook and this newer Chromebook, there are some differences that are noticeable. On the newer model, the power cable plugs into the back, which is also where the USB slots are, while the 550 plugs onto the left hand side where the USB slots are also housed. Battery life on my 550 is a couple hours longer, the screen is larger, and it looks sleeker - the newer model folds up leaving a kind of line at the back making it look a bit clunky, design wise. Then again my 550 is also pricier (though with the cash-back offer Samsung ran when I bought it at PC World, the difference was only fifty pounds).But in terms of speed and browsing, there's no noticeable difference. My parents are delighted with the Chromebook and love the speed and ease with which they can go online, check email, and then turn it off all within a minute whereas their old desktop clunker took about 15 minutes to fully start up and, when it did, browsing the internet was a slow and joyless activity (my father's words).The speed of Chromebook's boot up time is because the OS is in the Cloud (internet storage) so without an internet connection, this device is more or less worthless - this is why I've kept my Vaio for Office, movies, and downloads. It also doesn't have a disc drive so you can't play DVDs or Blu-Rays on it, and you can't download on to it, so no iTunes, or anything that requires downloading - the plus side being you don't need anti-virus software as no viruses can download onto your machine.For those looking for an affordable and easy to use device but don't like tablets and prefer using a mouse and keyboard (a lot more people than you think) then Chromebook is for me, and now my parents, the only way to go.", "Date": "January 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Thank you Google/Samsung!", "Author": "Jonathan", "ReviewID": "RNBW0J0NVO3QB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this chromebook for myself in early dec, and it hasn't left my side since.

It's still bigger than the tablet I have, which measures in at 10.1 inches. If you have bad eyes or like a bigger screen on your laptop, this probably isn't for you, unless you're planning on hooking up the HDMI out to an external monitor. The desktop environment looks remarkably similar to a Windows PC. The icons you will use most are in the lower left hand corner, where you would normally find the start bar. This laptop is fast and responsive. I generally keep up about 8-10 tabs on my browser, and this thing has no problem handling that. It really does boot up in 10 seconds (and in my experience, less than that). No waiting through windows boot screens, no antivirus updates to manage.I love the keyboard. It's a chiclet style keyboard, similar to what you'd see on a Mac air, but it is very fun to type on. The touchpad is pretty big, which is good, and you can either tap or click to select things. I'm not super impressed with the responsiveness of the trackpad, but I'll reserve judgement until I've messed around with the sensitivity settings a little.The lower right hand has the date and time, as well as a battery meter. Clicking on it gets you to the settings and allows you to see how much time the laptop thinks you'll get out of the battery. Fun fact: when you plug the laptop in, that timer changes to show you how much longer it will take before it's charged. While we're on the topic of battery life, I haven't really gotten a chance to put the computer through it's paces, but I have been taking it to class with me on Thursdays, where I'm in class from 11:30am-10pm, and I use it for a couple hours at a time, several times throughout the day. I left it sitting, off, in my backpack until Friday night when I got home from work (about 9pm) and just for funsies I flipped it on to see how dead the battery was, and to my surprise, there was still juice in it. I was pretty impressed, especially because some of the other laptops I've bought in the past really suck down the battery, even while on standy. I'll post more as I get more time in with it.I'm pretty deeply entrenched in the Google ecosystem, so I was already familiar with alot of the products; Docs, Spreadsheets, Music, Chrome, etc. I love all of them. They run great, and I can still take notes in class in offline mode if there isn't wifi available (which is almost never). Google Docs is just as good as Microsoft word, and lets you do cloud printing. What's not to love?Overall: I love it. The screen looks better than I expected (especially from a $250 laptop) and the boot time is a thing of beauty. I would definitely recommend this to anyone thinking about getting a cheap computer. This is the perfect laptop for someone who really only does browser-based computing. If you're not sure if that's you, think about what you actually do on the computer. How often do you run a CD with software on it? Are there any specific programs you need to be able to run (like Photoshop or music editing software)? If not, and you're like me, then all you probably do is email, Facebook, Google searches, stream music, and do some word processing, all of which you can do on this laptop.Update 5/31/13: I've now had my Chromebook for about 5 months now. I'm still very happy with my purchase. I've been able to use it quite a bit, and up until recently, I've used it as my main computer at home. Overall, I would still say this laptop is worth the money and I would definitely recommend it to others. The battery on this laptop is pretty good for casual use, but if you're a power user, i.e., you do some marathon computing sessions where you're using it for a 4-5 hours solid, you'll want to keep it plugged in. During the school year, I had about a four hour break between classes where I'd usually have to write papers. 9/10 times it would last the entire duration, and this was after being up for about 4-5 hours previously. A weird thing I discovered with the headphone port; I plugged in some speakers at home that I would leave in the computer all the time. However, sometimes when I woke the computer up and tried to play something that required sound, nothing would come out until I unplugged and replugged the speakers. This is a minor inconvenience for me, since normally I use the built in laptop speakers, but I thought it worth mentioning. Like I said before, overall, I love the computer. The more I use it, the more I like it. And it's still just as fast now as it was the day I bought it. I've tinkered around with the touchpad settings and it's better the more sensitive you set it. I've also set it on the beta channel, which means I get to try out new features of the Chromebook software before they hit the mainstream.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent ultra portable internet computer", "Author": "J. Limandri", "ReviewID": "R1TMH52CUY3Y4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love my chromebook. For the price its an excellent ultra portable internet computer.  Their advertising says its for everyone and I disagree with that.  To me for certain people this device is as good or better than the most expensive laptops available.  But for some users it may be too limited.  Hardware wise I think the keyboard is very good and full size, much better than I expected.  The touch pad is excellent, and I am not a big fan of using touch pads over a mouse.  The screen is good.  Its a little washed out and dull but its decent.  The screen is very good with glare.  The hardware performance is very good.  A little below a higher end desktop or laptop though.  On most web pages esp if you don't have many tabs open its as good as any higher end computer.  But some pages especially with many tabs open it doesn't perform as well as a higher end computer.  Video play back was very good. I played up to 720p without any problems.  Sometimes when the video first stared there was  a stutter but then it played flawless after that.  With 1080p it stuttered.  Software wise I think its a good system for most people but not for everyone.  I don't think chromebook would be a power users main computer.  I consider myself a power user but for me its a secondary ultra portable computer.  I think its great for people who mostly turn on their computer and just open the brower.  It also does a little more than a regular browser, there is google's cloud office suite google drive.  There are also other apps and addons that can do stuff you expect from a computer.  I think this device nails it for what it is trying to be.  An ultraportable cloud computer.  Its what netbooks should have been.  I think a lot of people buying ipads or windows 8 laptops would actually get value out of this device...but that depends on the users needs.  Can't wait to see next years which will likely be based on Samsungs 8 core processor.

I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews, and finally purchased one after I got some extra spending cash and a credit card. I bought this for school and of course personal use, and it's absolutely perfect--in regards to what I thought it would be and what it can do.First off, disregard reviews from customers who are unsatisfied with the limitations of the Chromebook. If you didn't know it couldn't do something you desired, it's on your part; you should have done research into what exactly a Chromebook can and can't do.So yes, it's essentially a quick and simple computer that goes online. I'll be using this for writing papers, and doing all online related work for school. Quick shotgun of my personal assessment: very fast boot-up time as expected, keyboard is fantastic (very Mac-esque, one of the few things I like about macbooks), battery time is great, display is great (really), haven't tested the camera yet, trackpad could be better (at times, it's a bit off but not a big deal and it's working fine now), sound is great, build quality is great.Anyway, feel free to shoot any questions you may have about the Chromebook. I love Google and all, but I'm not biased enough to disregard the truth of any flaws.Edit - Random miscellaneous things: headphone needs to be pushed in very firmly into the jack, bottom of laptop gets warm/hot but definitely nowhere as hot as a normal laptop with a standard processor.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Chromebook", "Author": "Samuel L.

Expecting it to do anything else and your expecting to much. Yes it may play SOME video file types and audio but it is hardly built for that and a normal machine with VLC or some other video player will do the job vastly better. Your limited to using online services to do anything, but have offline Google Docs/Scratchpad and a couple other things. There is the 2 years worth of 100gb online storage, which is good for backing up files online so you can quickly access them on the go since your 16gb HD will get filled quickly if you try to use it. I personally just use the 100gb free storage for backing up files off site.If your buying this with the expectation of using the 100gb of online storage as if it was a hard drive, don't. It's best used as a backup of your data and to quickly upload your newly made files in Google Docs and such so you can access it anywhere with an Internet connection. As trying to rely on an Internet connection to get the data isn't a good way to go about it, and sometimes it has taken a few minutes for things to show up in the Google Drive folder on the laptop itself. Which trust me put me into a bit of a panic after I wrote a 4 page essay and it wasn't appearing when I needed to submit it in a few hours. After 10min or so it finally appeared. This is one of the small bugs or shortcomings I found with the OS, there were 1-2 other bugs I found after I thoroughly put it through it paces in the last few weeks. May sound like a lot, but honestly I find more on my primary Win 7 desktop machine in the same time frame, the difference is that I have other options in terms of programs on the Windows machine so I can ignore it. Where as with this I have to work with it.What everyone says is true the boot time is incredibly fast. Never felt the need to time it myself. It will get your online so you can check emails/facebook/etc. With me I personally bought it for school, which means I will end up using Google docs for notes and writing assignment (than putting it into a real word processor before submitting, so I can use spelling/grammar check). As well and researching assignments all of which this thing will do quite well.What this laptop is though is the exact definition of K.I.S.S (Keep It Short and Simple). It is a stripped down OS with cheap quality hardware which was selected to give the best user experience, not benchmark experience. The arm A15 1.7ghz dual core is more than capable of handling all tasks this was designed for (Internet) and the SSD provides a quick boot experience, quality keyboard/touchpad and overall build quality. The only grip here is with the screen with bad viewing angels, and how the light sensor keeps adjusting the screen too much based on the light condition.The OS itself is one of the things I like the most. It is highly sandboxed with how the OS was designed, with updates pushed silently in the background. And all the user data is encrypted with 128bit encryption, and quite a bit of other encryption found in various other places in the OS using the TPM. Something I won't go into as it's a good read if you look into it, and some of it goes over my head so I'd rather not spread false information. For me the encryption part is quite important as it is a laptop and will be used on the go and having it lost/stolen will just mean I lose the device itself and not half to worry about personal information being compromised. Assuming it is powered down, or signed off not just a locked screen (and you used a good strong password). The OS also has a \"Self Healing\" which I hear some people refer to it as, when the computer turns on it checks against a known good version of itself to check for tampering and if there is any tampering it will use that instead of the tampered version.The biggest strength this laptop has is also it's weakness. It is built with simplicity in mind. It carries the mentality of \"If it works it works, if it doesn't it doesn't\" there are pretty much no workarounds to that (K.I.S.S as I referred to it earlier). Where as with a Window or \"real\" Linux based machine there is almost always a workaround you can do to get the job done. Where as with this if something doesn't work your out of luck, your not given the ability to install any actual programs or any real control in the computer settings. The amount of control in the computer settings is what you find in the Chrome Browser and a few other small settings which I wouldn't mind someone computer illiterate play with (AKA no real ability to change anything). But you do have the option to change the \"search key\" back to \"caps lock\" if you choose to do so. Though personally I found more use for the search key as it brings up the minimized taskbar and will search the Internet and various other things for you.In short this laptop is made to be used on the Internet, nothing more nothing less. If you want a laptop to do basic web browsing on the cheap this is for you. If you want something to write up paper and do web browsing, you can do that to. But I highly recommend loading up what you write into a real word processor so you can take advantage of spelling/grammar check and all the other features Google Docs doesn't provide or provide a good enough version of as I find it quite basic. In terms of buying this for school, I find it would be quite good for that so far from playing with it for the last several weeks though I haven't had a chance to try it out in class myself yet. As I already put several notes into Google docs so far, and have had great battery life with this. You can easily make it through any class without charging.And to answer your question you may be asking yourself. Yes it's a great little laptop and worth buying IF you can manage to work within it's limitations. If you want to know if you can, install chrome on your computer and try to use nothing but that and Google docs, Google drive, and other Google web based programs for a day or two. The rest of the OS is quite simple to learn, it took me less than 10min to figure out almost everything I could do with it due to having experience with Chrome Browser.

Still you can only check one gMail account at a time via a browser.  On the sly, I installed the native ChromeOS Remote Desktop on my work machine to get around the VPN issue and it works.

I have to remember to shut off the host display if I'm remote desktopping.Initial Review:-----------------My first impressions having this for 24 hours.  Feeling a bit disappointed with the features it lacks as my original purpose was to use it to connect to my work network.  VPN support is very limited as of March 2013 -- Two types of LT2P/IPSec and an OpenVPN.  My office uses PPTP so this poses a huge problem.  And I found an app that allows you to connect directly to the Windows Remote Desktop protocol for work.I was expecting this to be the Cubic Zirconia to the Macbook Air and it is!

At first it was a huge pain in the ass. It certainly does take some getting use to but once you know how to use this device it is amazing. My biggest complaint, after acknowledging all of the major drawbacks of having a chromebook, was that this device couldn't play certain video formats at first. The workaround was to rename the videos to mp4, was pretty easy but very annoying when your watching a Supernatural marathon and that means over 75+ renames. You certainly can not get by with having this chromebook as your main computer unless all you do is Google Chrome because that is ALL it is. It does not have it's own apps. If you add an \"app\" from the Chrome Webstore it downloads a link which will open up your \"app\" in a tab. Clicking on settings will also take you to another tab in chrome. It is ALL chrome, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Once you understand that this is not a Windows or Mac or Linux computer you will start to see how easy it is to use, since it is only a web browser and nothing more. For this reason it would be perfect for kids or old people that don't know much about computers. It boots up in under 10 seconds, including time to input password. It goes from sleep to fully on in under 2 seconds. I don't know about the rest of you but that is ridiculously fast! Thousand dollar computers can't even do that, well none that I know of. The speakers are VERY LOUD! I am not an audiophile but the speakers are much more than I was expecting. The only con about them is you can cover them easily if you put them on your lap but it is still more than usable. The screen doesn't wow me but I wasn't expecting much. I like the matte display as it greatly reduces reflection. The keyboard feels pretty good. The trackpad feels decent, not premium but much better than some other ones. My only complaint with the trackpad is if you lift it up and click on things there is a possibility that it may get stuck but can easily be fixed by putting it down and clicking it again. I do a lot of homework on this. I completely forgo Microsoft Word and the other Office programs and I use Google Docs for everything. I love Google Drive. Not only does it have everything you need for work but when I have group projects, which is all the time, it is a LOT more convenient and very helpful being able to collaborate together in real time. Cloud storage is amazing too, especially with videos and how Google Drive has a YouTube player, doesn't actually upload videos to YouTube, that streams videos you upload. Incredibly cool when I am at school or at a friend's house and don't want to the movie but I can stream it. The 100GB is insane too, it doesn't even count the Google apps like Docs or Presentation! The battery life on this machine is amazing as well. I never need to use it more than several hours at a time and when i'm not using it I charge it. Regardless the battery life is easily 6hrs+. This is also INCREDIBLY light and thin as well. I would say that this feels lighter than the MacBook Air. Despite being plastic I feel like this is a premium device when I use it.

Living in Brussels (Belgium), this particular chromebook is not officially available in the European mainland as far as I know. This is the first drawback, it costs me additional fees to get it here via an intermediary company.Before I start with the critics I want to state that I serieously recommend this product to every everyday user of the internet. It is way better and efficient than using a much more expensive tablet. I think that most of the positive critics are already widely known due to Googles campaign and other news media writing about this product. So I will predominantly focus on the not so great experiences I sometimes had with this product the first few weeks after I received it.Startup, screen, speakersOn the functioning of the Chromebook: It works great! Seriously fast startup time as well as opening files etc. (due to the 16gb SSD) the screen is very clear and the speakers work fine. Keep in mind that I say this with the price category in mind. it is not a full-HD screen and the speakers are small and of mediocre quality compared to any high-end stereo system. Still equal or better than most notebooks I used.Bodythe plastic body is again of low cost quality but suffices when treated when care you'd expect from a notebook user. the four pads on the bottom that are used for support are working well, when on a hard surface it does not slip. A serious drawback is the thickness of the rubber supporters. just a small grain of hard material can cause loads of scratches on the bottom side. Like most notebooks the battery gets quite warm when using the charger or watching a long video like a movie. The absence of a hard drive (no fan) helps not getting overheated though.keyboard and touchpadthe keyboard is GREAT. I really like that Google kept the standard size despite of having a relatively small screen. It works great. not flaws whatsoever. Instead of the Caps-lock key there is a search key. Example of added application value: having a lot of bookmarks, it is much more efficient to just hit the search button and type the first 2-3 letters of the webpage, enter, of you gothe touchpad is another story; it works very precise, the clicking and tapping as well. But when the chromebook is charging, half of the time the touchpad is not precise at all. up and down, left and right movements are far from precise and diagonal movement is just impossible. One will see a zig-zag snake movement.Functioning Chrome OSChrome OS is working smooth most of the time. It is told that although it is a very stripped down operating system it works perfectly for its main goal: Getting the user the best internet experience. In my opinion this works great most of the time but there were several instances, especially when streaming videos and using the full screen mode, that the screen just goes black and one had to use the escape button to get it back working again. other more serious problems occurred also when in the same situation as mentioned before but then the whole system would all of a sudden shut down, for no reason. the last system failure I have experienced also for several times was that it just got stuck when playing a video in full screen mode. In the manual there is no solution for such a situation mentioned but i just pressed the on/off button for several seconds and the system would restart like nothing went down. So the stability of the system is seriously debatable in my opinion. fingers crossed that the automatic updates will solve these problems...Last point I want to critisize, is that loads of programs are not compatible (yet) with Chrome OS. Applications like Skype and Silverlight do not work on Chrome OS. Maybe because the group of users is still relatively small or maybe for other reasons. I hope google or the simple increase of Chrome OS user would change the minds of the companies that do not have made there applications Chrome OS compatible.Looking back at the above mentioned criticism, I do not want to create an image of this chromebook to be not good.

I still can't believe this laptop is only $250. I have been an Apple user since 1989 and this is the first non-Apple computer I've ever purchased. I got this as a second (or third) computer as I have an iMac as my main system and an ailing MBP circa 2007 that is still chugging along. I was looking at replacing the MBP with a Macbook Air, but was balking at the pricetag. I really didn't need it to do any heavy lifting in terms of video, photo or web work, but mainly to catch up on email, keep up with scheduling, do some research and use office documents. I've since found a lot more uses for it...For me the killer app on this system is the Remote Desktop app which means that you can access your main system remotely and use any app on that system, save to Google Drive or Drop Box and you're good to go while away from your office. It is small, light and very quick. I've had zero issues in the three weeks I've had it. I'm happy to be free of Apple's spinning beachball (curiously never happens when I'm buying something from their store...), the weight of my old MBP and am super happy that this cost me a sixth of the cost of a Macbook Air!!!Cloud computing is easy to get used to. Google makes it ridiculously easy. They will need to beef up their app store to make this viable in the long term and I believe they will do it.A quick note for Canadian customers. You're going to have to purchase this in the US and bring it back with you. A lot of Google's products like Google Play for music and movies don't work in Canada which really sucks. You only need the wifi version as the 3G is pointless here. There are plenty of great apps to do what you normally do in those bloated, overly expensive Mac apps (can't speak for Windows), it's just a question of finding the appropriate equivalent. To be honest, my MBP is sitting on my desk with the lid shut collecting dust. I don't have to think twice to take the Chromebook with me as it is so small and light. The build quality is really impressive, maybe not as sexy as a MBA, but definitely well built. Samsung and Google have really done an incredible job! Well done!!! I can't recommend this little laptop and Chrome OS highly enough. If you're on the fence, get off and pull the trigger.Now please get those great apps working in Canada.

I know that this is not due to ANY misuse as my there is no cross device usage between my wife and I (she has her ipad etc. and has been away for work for the duration) and it shut down perfectly fine.To reiterate, there has been NO PHYSICAL DAMAGE, there isn't a mark on the thing, no drops, no knocks, the screen has been opened from the center at all times so there is no twisting.  Just...spiderweb cracks everywhere.  Apparently this is classed as physical damage and user error by Samsung so their warranty doesn't cover it.  I googled the issue and found MANY other people finding the same thing, also reporting that Samsung don't seem to be aware of it (also be aware that most extended warranties that do not explicitly state repair of user error damage will not cover this e.x best buy).  $250 might be cheap but I expect something to work for longer than nine monthI'm basically left with a brick now unless I want to go to the trouble of trying to find a replacement screen from screen surgeons or someone.  A shame, I have a samsung phone, fridge, dishwasher, microwave, soundbar, and am writing this on a samsung tv. and this is the first product that I'm ashamed to have bought into so readily, it feels cheap (but acceptable for such a low price) but the sheer poor screen build quality and lack of owning up to the problem have soured me on at least another of these products from them.  I'll be looking elsewhere for a replacement.  I'm sure that thousands of you don't have this problem, but I've just became one of those one star people whom I always look at and wonder \"Why one star if everyone else loves it\", for things like this.=============================This arrived yesterday, came well packaged and secure (though only paper was used by amazon to secure the chromebook box within the main package).  After unboxing and turning on (for some reason it would only turn on the first time when it was connected to the mains power supply despite it then being at 98%, it's been on and off since then, I think it could have been a user problem?) the setup couldn't be simpler, just log in using your google account...and that's it.The build quality for the price is excelled, nothing felt 'hollow' or unsupported, the keyboard is very satisfying to use, as is the trackpad and multi touch.  I thought that the screen wouldn't be very bright having read some of the other reviews but at max brightness it was definitely bright enough for me!  I happened to find 1/2 to 2/3 brightness better to work at.  The keys looks nice and the dedicated browsing buttons are great and take the place of F1-F12 etc.(as you no longer need F keys).  my only turn off is that after typing for a few hours there was already a patina of grease on the space bar  from my thumb (I was my hands, honestly!) that I'm going to keep on top of with chlorox wipes (I guess it's good for hygiene) but that surprised me as it took a 'long' time for my last laptop to show this shine on its keys (mostly because I was wearing the plastic away from use).All the 'apps' work as you would expect and look basically like their online counterparts (most of the apps are just links to the online versions) though you can use documents offline and they will be uploaded next time you connect to the internet, you can also choose to sync your google documents and download your files for use offline (not sure how this will work if I go over the storage limit of the chromebook...or where they're kept when they can be used offline as they're not in the \"files\" folder.Connectability seems good, USB ports, AV out, SD card slots etc. all present, the power supply seems a weak spot in the back if you knock it off a table or drop it, looks like it's waiting to snap off due to it being very thin.  I heard that the bottom scratches easily so assumed that it had no support pads but it does...so I can only assume people are resting it on their laps on ... zips or something, it seems fine to me.Battery length...is awesome.  I sat and types for 3 hours + online last night on 2/3 brightness and the adaptive battery monitor but me at around 55-60% with 4 hours left at that useage level so it definitely does what I need it to in that aspect.As we all know, Netflix is not working at the moment on this due to the ARM processor but it looks like it's in the works, hulu works as does pandora etc. and crunchyroll for those who like anime so that's nice.You can easily customize the background etc. and the in built camera/mic is nice for vid chatting though you're currently limited to google vid etc.  having the guest option is a nice touch, I can just hold the power button once, log off and someone else is on instantly to browse around (basically puts it into incognito mode so nothing is saved).  Startup time is around 9-10 seconds to the desktop depending on how fast you can type your password but it's about 7-8 seconds to the main login screen as promised.Google drive is easily upgraded and adds onto whatever google drive is associated with the first account you log in with.  I'm still not sure how to get my internet passes but I'll worry about that when I actually a) need them b) go on an airline where I can use them.  I don't think I could ever use my 5gb so 105gb is a massive amount.  I haven't tried streaming video from google drive (not sure if that's even possible) but if it is that could be a nice compromise from movies on a flash drive/SD card.Google remote looks promising if you don't mind keeping your main pc on at home as you could theoretically load programs on that and remote control it to display on the chromebook (correct me if I'm wrong).Once I've used it more regularly I'll update this with any problems I've found but so far Samsung appear to have hit it out of the park and I have zero actual complaints (no start errors requiring reloads that other users seem to have). Would definitely recommend.------------------------------------------Edit: 4/9/2013I use my chromebook for my extended campus program (about 5 hours at a time) and I've never yet ran out of battery or came close, with lower brightness settings, not using speakers etc.  just wireless and typing I can get 8 hours.  Average life is dot on 6 hours as promised.  As a build issue I have noticed that the trackpad on the bottom right is a little lower than the left, easier to click, I don't know if this was intended but it hasn't gotten worse and it's not that noticeable but I thought I'd mention it.The auto update works flawlessly (I had a minor issue when I changed my google password but once it connected to the wifi it asked me to update it), you get to use sites like hulu and crackle along with Netflix (I hear, I haven't tried yet myself but apparently this has been a recent change!)If you're looking for a replacement for your desktop pc (or even your traditional OS laptop) this isn't for you, if you're looking to supplement it, go right ahead, you won't regret it.Also I've never seen any of the problems that the 1 stars have mentioned, black screens, dead, having to push reset, not finding wireless etc.  I think it could have been a bad  early batch.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware of Samsung warranty practices", "Author": "John E.

It is very simple, small, light weight, and practically virus proof.

My other computer would no longer turn on and had a million problems.

It seems to be really high quality, and it's just an amazing laptop in general. I'm a high school student so I really wanted a laptop that wasn't too big, worked fast, was light and thin, and was easy to write on and browse the internet--I got all of those things in this! I would highly recommend this for anyone, even older people. It's so simple to use, and the software is really good. People that prefer larger screens might not care for it, but I think it's the perfect size, and the good graphics and software make up for it I think. This laptop reminds me a lot of a Macbook. True to their word, the computer turns on in less than 8 seconds, and when it's in sleep mode and you open the lid it turns on in probably 2 seconds. The keyboard and mouse pad is really nice too. It might take a while to get used to some of the shortcuts you have to use on here, like the copy and paste, but I've already gotten the hang of it and it's really easy. The keyboard is really easy to type on, and I really like the feel of it. If you like keys that are more thick and press down more than you might not like this, but I think it's really good. I honestly have no complaints, and I wouldn't change anything. I have noticed that the screen and lid of the computer gets a little smudgy, but that was really no big deal for me and you can easily wipe it off with your sleeve or a cloth. Also I know that a lot of people use their computers to watch Netflix and or stream it onto their TV, and it works perfectly! I think the graphics are really good, and the sound really isn't bad at all. Since I've only had this for less than a day I'll write an update later on to say how I'm liking it and how it's holding up, but if you're looking for a fast and thin computer that won't get viruses, I think this would be the perfect laptop for you. They even give you a free 100GB storage for Google Drive that you can store photos, videos, and writing documents in, and I've found that really helpful.Here's a list of pros and cons I've come up with and then that's it! Hope this was helpful.PROS:-Very fast and reliable-Thin and light weight so you can easily carry it places-Pretty decent webcam so you can video chat with people-Updates software automatically so you always have the latest stuff-Easy for browsing the web and writing-Not very expensive!CONS:-No disk drive-No iTunes, only Google Music-You can't download games or software like Minecraft", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Don't Waste Your Money On This", "Author": "Lawrence", "ReviewID": "RAT5T1BMFL9L2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Had this less than six months and it began randomly shutting down and restarting.

That being said, here's my review.I got this fast as ever from Amazon (Thanks Prime). Unboxing wasn't spectacular, but hey, who cares really. It didn't start when I first picked it up, but when I plugged it in, it started right away, and the battery had about 75% charge. I thought it was weird it didn't start up immediately but no big deal.Battery Life: Amazing! This thing really does last 6.5 hours on a charge (a full charge is just over an hour) which is pretty spectacular for a laptop these days.Screen: It's slightly lackluster. The resolution is good, but it just doesn't have that 'pop' that most of the expensive laptops have these days. There's also an angle 'issue' that if you're not at the right viewing angle, it's a bit hard to see it, but hey, that's why it opens more...OS: I love the Chrome operating system, and I use the browser on my desktop. It's great having everything the same when you go to another computer. It's fast, responsive, and works well. I haven't had an issue yet.Keyboard: I really like it. I'm kind of picky about laptop keyboards so I don't like most, but this one feels good, although not top of the line. I'm a big guy with larger hands, but they fit nicely on the keyboard without any problems.Wifi: This works great, and was easy to connect.Webcam: This is probably the worst part of the product. With technology the way it is, there's no reason there can't be a webcam that doesn't lag and have bad lighting like this one does. I haven't used it much, but I don't see it as a great means of communication as it's not good quality and could be frustrating to another used trying to see me.Each purchase comes with a free 100GB of could storage from Amazon which is more than anyone should need. I don't have problems saving things to the cloud, as it's easy to do and keeps the computer itself from getting bogged down like older ones seem to do. There is a slight learning curve for this thing as it isn't Windows, but if you know your way around a computer this is not a problem.Overall I love this thing and I'm glad I finally got it. The plastic is a bit cheap feeling, but for under $300 after taxes and shipping it's well worth it! If you're looking for a piece of equipment for younger kids, students, or just for browsing the internet or working on documents, this is the best option out there!", "Date": "January 14, 2014"}, {"Title": "Perfect for writing and the Internet", "Author": "Gordon E.

The piece of code that allows you to do this is called \"Crouton\", and is freely available from a GitHub repository with a very simple set of installation instructions included. It is developed mainly by a guy from Google, and it's been getting quite a bit of traction lately.After installing a version of Ubuntu using Crouton, along with the XFCE desktop, I was very surprised at the overall responsiveness of the system, as well as at how easy it is to switch from Ubuntu to Crome OS with a simple keyboard shortcut.Granted, there are some things that still need some more work (e.g. playing videos and flash support out of the box), but given how easy it is to switch from one OS to the other (videos and flash are totally supported in Chrome OS), it's not really a deal breaker for me. I was not really expecting this from such a cheap laptop.In terms of the hardware, I found the keyboard comparable in quality to the ones in recent models of the MacBook Air. The laptop itself, as you can see in the pictures, is pretty slim and lightweight, something I appreciate since I hate carrying around heavy laptops. The touchpad quality is good, but I do miss the support for a full range of gestures found in Apple's computers. One thing I do wish this laptop had is a larger SSD. 16 GB of storage means you will need to keep a lot of your data in an external drive (it's true Google does give you 100GB of free cloud storage for two years, but unless you have a really fast Internet connection, this is no replacement for a hard drive if you're moving around large files). Again, not a deal breaker for me, but something to keep in mind.Overall, it turned out to be an excellent laptop for me once I installed Crouton (and Ubuntu) on it.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Holiday gift for an electric enginner, a big success!", "Author": "gene D.", "ReviewID": "R1DGLNWDLHBEUL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my electric engineer guy friend, not young by any means, so as not to mistake \"likeing this very much\" with stars in his eyes.

Got one of these for my daughter for Christmas (I already have had one for 6 months). Within 10 minutes she was editing a doc from her google docs account, was also looking at tumbler feeds and messaging back-and-forth with 2 different people through facebook, and was adding extensions and apps to the browser based system. And she never even cracked the plastic bag the \"start-up guide\" came in. She's 14 - enough said.2. Went camping with 2 chromebooks (I have one and my significant other has one too - she has also posted a favorable review of her's here) and they performed flawlessly in temps well below freezing. We were tent camping and it got down to around *20 and these things still picked up a park wifi signal and didn't turn into toasters or anything like that. I know this means something because her iPhone went into freakout mode from the cold at around *35. We have also dropped these a few times, had cats lay all over them, tossed them in backpacks that got bumped around, etc. While I wouldn't recommend ANY of this, I'm just pointing out that these little babies are pretty tough. There is no \"super-delicate\" glass screen that will crack if you breath on it funny, or very cheep keyboard that will spring apart the first time you hit one with any force.Update - This thing even got a few ounces of coffee spilled on it and stopped working for all of 15 minutes. A little time under the hair dryer to get things right, and it is back up and running. I'm thinking this thing is a plastic tank.Update 4/9/2014 - the Chromebook I got my daughter now never leaves her side. And the one we use at home sat in a puddle of water overnight thanks to active cats knocking a cup over. Let it dry out for 2 days and it fired right up with no problems (again, I would not recommend this activity).

Yate", "ReviewID": "R3E3Y99GEFLVLN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would like to start by saying how cool this device is, I got it for my father for Christmas who had a 1904 laptop and we both love it. My father utilizes the computer mainly to browse the internet, listen to music, watch youTube, chat and email. I believe this was the very perfect gift for him because his old laptop was crashing on him because it was getting old it was really heavy and it wasn't holding a charge. It is very simple to use even for a not so computer savvy person.The chromebook is very light, it is lighter than my Kindle Fire(previous Generation) is compact and just the right size. it is not too big or too small. I believe the 11.6 inch is a pretty decent size for what my dad uses the computer for. We were watching youTube videos while browsing the internet and the computer does its job very effortless. We also own a smart TV and my dad was so trilled that he can stream videos from his laptop into the TV without having to download the video into the computer and putting it in a memory stick. You can also use the HDMI connection into the TV, however the Bluetooth option is a lot better because he can play the video and browse the internet at the same time.Whenever my father wants to write a document he can use Google docs which converts a word document automatically into a Microsoft Document, also you can save the document into  your Google Drive which gives you 115 GB of memory for FREE for two years that\u2019s a huge savings right there including the fact that you don\u2019t have to buy programs to write a simple document. In addition it comes with antivirus so you just turn the computer on and browse it up!!! Note: that this computer does not work like a regular Microsoft computer it only downloads apps.When we first opened it, we just logged on with our current Gmail account and uploaded some of the free apps. It was fast and easy we tested the apps, and we uploaded 500 songs I owned in iTubes into Google music player from the old computer without any hassles.Over all this computer is very useful , practical, compact and it is great for somebody who just uses it for Web, video, chatting and email, I find it even better than a tablet.

It was a step that I wanted to take because I now do everything in the cloud, and have an Android phone and tablet.So, the limitations are:- Can only print to Google cloud ready printers. Or classic printers that are connected to a PC.YOU CANNOT DIRECTLY CONNECT A USB PRINTER TO A CHROMEBOOK, which renders my older Wi-Fi/Bluetooth printer, that is not cloud compatible, useless with my Chromebook. Fortunately, I can print to my husbands B&W; laser printer, but not my awesome color photo printer.- If you are planning on using this to replace a windows laptop or tower, you may need an external monitor, keyboard and mouse.I have a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse that uses the same USB dongle (Logitech's Unifying hardware that can connect up to 6 peripherals to one USB dongle.). This is great to save one of the two USB ports. I would have a printer in the other port... if it worked, but instead it has my phone charger in it. Have also ordered a 20\" Samsung HDMI monitor. This Chromebook does have an HDMI port.- New keyboard shortcuts to learn, and some standard keys not there.E.g. delete - you have to press Alt+Backspace. This is pretty easy to get used to, but not a problem if you have an external keyboard, where all of the regular keys work just the way they should.The number pad on the external wireless keyboard does not work with the built in calculator app on the Chromebook. The number pad works in general text situations only. That's too bad.- Video camera is not awesome.But it works and is acceptable. However - Google Chromebook DOES NOT SUPPORT SKYPE. That's right, you cannot use Skype on this baby. Instead, you are encouraged to use Google Hangouts. I would love to, but none of my chat friends are on there - ha.Those limitations might be deal breakers for some, but I am still happy with my Samsung Chromebook.

The chromebook has allowed me to do that and much more. Working strictly from the cloud takes some getting used to and so does crossing over from whatever typical word processors or spreadsheets you are used to using, but once you do the benefit of being able to access those docs and spreadsheets (or presentations, etc.) from anywhere outweighs the learning curve. I thought that not having a large hard drive would bug me but since I use my desktop for all downloads it really hasn't hindered anything I've tried to do. I would insert a caveat here and that being, if you don't have another computer (laptop with a large hard drive or desktop), I wouldn't choose this computer simply because there are some things that chrome os (although I love it) cannot do and you don't have storage space for large downloads.The price point is also a huge plus for many of us students who don't the discretionary income to drop on a macbook.

Matthews", "ReviewID": "R3IQRTJGYIEQXF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A review for the mature crowd, on using the Chromebook as your go to computer.  It actually is a 5 star but I gave it 4 because the size leaves just a little on the \"wanting/needs\" list.I've been using computers since 1979 and now at 72 I\u2019m using a Samsung 11.3\u201d Chromebook and the whole Google Chrome OS experience.  At 250 bucks it\u2019s a great deal for what it does because it does it flawlessly, with minor exceptions.  The Chromebook size is almost perfect as a convenient door into the internet.  At about the size of a pad of paper it has all you need.  All the positive marketing points of the machine and Google Chrome OS system are true. For the majority of the population it fills our needs and is as simple as it gets.  If you use MS Internet Explorer the first thing you will notice is Google Chrome has eliminated every annoying attribute MS-IE ever invented.  Be honest with yourself and think about what you really do on your personal home computer.  If you feel the need for a Microsoft OS along with all the annoying security and daily updates in addition to the same for MS Office on a 1500 buck desktop maybe you should consider incorporating your family and hiring an IT guy too.  Personally I feel Google is the future of internet computing for the world.As to the negative aspects of using the Chromebook as my \u201cgo to\u201d computer.  After three weeks of using the Samsung 11.3\" Chromebook the screen is still difficult to see and hard on my eyes.  Adjustments have been made for larger fonts and color changes have been made on some reading materials.  Could be because this reviewer wears bifocal eye glasses but it\u2019s more than that.  There just isn\u2019t much real estate to move things around especially when it comes to photos.  The clarity of the screen just doesn't pop out at you as would be the case in the Chromebook Pixel (I\u2019m assuming).  However more to the point is the color or contrast on some web pages.  An example is Google Calendar,  the type just doesn't have good contrast.. One major problem on some web pages is the page does not fit on the screen.  I\u2019m not a web designer so  I\u2019m not sure where the problem is, the web, the Chromebook or Google. An example: I was on the Delta Airline reservations site and I could not use it to make my reservations because some of the page was overlaid and jumbled.  Same problems happened on many other sites where you have selection options in ordering things.Again, for the 250 bucks delivered into your house it is a steal.  It is really the perfect \u201crecliner\u201d companion for wireless surfing the web and general research/entertainment needs. Plus Google has so many \u201capps\u201d you could spend the rest of your life just setting those up for \u201cwhatever\u201d.", "Date": "October 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good to have", "Author": "J.

Its battery is good (but does not last as much as they promise). Due to google cloud storage you do not miss hard disk (though it gets very expensive after a point).My biggest complain is about the invisible button on the touch pad. You can click on the lower half of the touch pad to \"left click\". But in this product the button gets stuck. So it is as good as you are clicking and holding it down for a very very long time. Some times it does not come back unless you click a second time. I have three of these devices and ALL of them have the problem. So they probably have whole batch of faulty devices out there.Another problem with the touch pad is its ability to detect multi-touch. I have noticed that a lot of times it fails to detect multi-touch and you end up \"left clicking\" when you intend to write click. Samsung is trying to copy Apple Macs by providing only left click, but they need to realize that if they need to do a good job of it. A lot of people will prefer to have two separate buttons instead of one so it is ok to stick to old fashioned design.Another very serious flaw is that this device is UNACCEPTABLY (I cannot emphasize it more) slow when browsing pictures from my camera (connected via USB). It may be the software or the hardware, I do not know. But my 6 year old Toshiba laptop does a much better job of it.But it is a perfect device for people whose primary computing needs are email/facebook/netflix.

I currently have a 17.1\" laptop that I had been using but the weight and size made traveling and using it annoying. While sitting in a meeting I talked with somebody who was using a Chromebook and thought that this might be my solution. I had tried an ipad and other tablets but the onscreen keyboard and/or using a keyboard accessory was not a perfect solution because writing papers and taking notes required too many steps (plug in keybaord, switching between apps while multi-tasking between research/ writing, and finding a place to store my work that would be accessible by my PC/Laptop later). I have owned the Chromebook for about 3 weeks now and can say that this was the BEST solution for my situation, not perfect but best.Why it worked for me:- Instant on: The Chromebook is ready to run and go right away (like a tablet)- Good keyboard: Its keyboard is sufficient and easy to use (like a PC)- No distractions: I am not distracted by updating or unnecessary tasks because this is almost completely a cloud experience- Compact and light: Easily fits in my bag without. No need to buy a special bag to carry this around with you.- Great battery life: I sit in class on weekends for 6 hours or more, when fully charged my chromebook has lasted.- Easy to use: Chrome OS is simple- Connected: Chrome OS connects really well with my laptop and work PCThings I didn't like:- Its painted, I pull this in and out of my bag because of that the outside of the Chromebook has ugly scratches. I am not a fan of adding cases to my devices to protect their finish.- The screen is good, but I would have like something a bit brighter.Other things to know:- if you dont have wifi available or a hotspot you may be limited with what you can do. Google docs and such are available offline but work best when you are connected.- This is a SECONDARY device. This is not a replacement for your PC or laptop, but rather a way to become more mobile. IF you are considering this for your primary then you should expect to work mostly in cloud storage and know that certain things like gaming, photoshoping, etc can be done but not as easily or well done on a PC.- The price is great! I have lost devices before due to theft, damage, and disorganization.

First off, the build quality is amazing for the price.. It feels much sturdier than my netbook..  I also like the size of the device slightly better than the netbook.. I like SMALL laptops which is the reason I loved netbooks.. This laptop is slightly larger than a netbook but not big.I have read a lot of reviews talking about the screen quality.  I for one have not had a problem with screen quality.  Coming from a netbook, this screen is MUCH MUCH better..I have read other reviews speaking about the speed.. Again, coming from a netbook, this is a big improvement.  With that being said I have had no speed problems.  It runs fast, and can handle several tabs open at once.  I no longer dread loading up the laptop now..3G is great and I love the internet options.  The 100 free MB is mostly all I use but I love being able to purchase more monthly without a Verizon account..  I just purchase it when and if I need it!There are however a few problems.1.) I need access to Sheets..  There is no offline access to sheets at the time of this review.  This is the reason I purchased the 3g version..  The 100 MB of free internet is plenty to edit sheets while on the go.  I only purchase extra internet if I need to. I hope in the future I can have access to my sheets offline2.) Printing takes a little work and gone are the days of plugging your laptop into any printer and finding the driver. I hate the printing on the chromebook..

The small screen takes some getting used to, and it is certainly not something to 'work' with. But it's great for doing most of your web stuff... email, reading, video, music. The sound is very good considering how tiny and light this thing is.I would probably get the larger screen next time, but for now this is the perfect device to leisurely browse the web and check social sites (even shop) while relaxing outside or on the couch. Battery life is very good, startup is very quick, and overall a great experience for those not needing much.It might take a while to get used to the trackpad, and the slightly different key configuration (no buttons for trackpad, no delete or capslock or page up/down for keyboard) but remember what this notebook is for...  simple stuff at a simple price.Why only 4 stars? I just didn't want to say it was the greatest thing in the world. It has it's limitations, AS designed. If you are looking for something that is just for email and browsing, and maybe watching netflix, this thing is great.

The screen, while nice enough, uses a very matte surface to reduce glare, which causes it to look a bit dull, and slightly dirty.

I easily sync using GoogleDrive, Dropbox, SkyDrive and Evernote, so I have just about immediate access to all the files I need anytime as long as I'm connected to a network.  Ability to put into full-screen mode using [shift + screen] buttons to maximize viewing space and that works pretty well.  No moving parts so it should be more durable and battery lasts longer - I think this laptop is better than the cheaper Acer chromebook, which has a spinning hard disk.  Battery life is fantastic, it's lightweight, doesn't get hot, and I can use the small solid state hard drive to download/upload files between my accounts.Cons: Audio is poor, viewing the screen from an angle (from sides or above/below) is not great, and the hinge in the back prevents the screen from tilting back more than 45% (which is only an issue because of the usable viewing screen angle).  Can't print using USB connections, instead have to use network printer (not an issue for me, but might be for some). Can't replace my business laptop because Microsoft Office applications (powerpoint and excel for me) have no good online equivalent - online version of Office is limited and far too slow (although I can view any Office document using SkyDrive, which is nice since Google sheets and slides can't always render the images well).Overall, I think this is a great product that fills a niche use for me - everyday use at home and going out to a cafe to work.  It's definitely a value play and can't deliver on all the features I need for business, but they don't market it as such anyway.

PLEASE do your research and know what the computer is capable of doing and not doing.  It's not a complete replacement for a windows/mac PC.My only beef with this upon unboxing and start-up was I kept getting very slow web page load times and even kept getting kicked off my home wifi network (that previously had worked without problems on a PC).  As you can imagine this was very frustrating at first, obviously smooth internet connectivity is crucial to get the most out of a Chromebook.Did some research and found this was not an uncommon problem with this model Chromebook (Samsung 550).  Do a google search for \"chomebook wifi connectivity problems\" or similar and you'll see what I'm talking about.In short, to fix this I had to tweak 2 of my home WiFi routers settings.  This forced me to educate myself on some WiFi \"lingo\".FULL DISCLOSURE:  I am not a tech geek, these steps below are just to point you in the right direction if you are having similar issues, not a comprehensive step by step!  Your mileage may vary!1.  To remedy slow page load times, I had to change my encryption settings on my wifi router from WEP (a setting NO ONE should be using, I learned) to WPA2-PSK.  This is a much more secure setting anyway and seems to work with chromebooks that are having very slow page load times running off home wifi (not 3G).2.  To remedy the issue of occasionally (often) losing my wifi connection, I had to change my wifi router's network mode (ie:  b/g/n) to just broadcasting on the g network only.  Apparently if you live in an area where other wifi networks are broadcasting on mixed modes, the Samsung 550s get \"confused\" and will bump you off.

The good news is it's very light, the bad is that it feels somewhat cheap and plastic-y.  I don't like the matte screen at all as things don't look sharp and clear, whether text or images.  I tried hooking it up via HDMI to my 24\" ASUS monitor and even there the image quality was poor.  I'm used to Windows and the big monitor and crisp looking images and text and don't want to regress to the level the Chromebook is at.I also didn't like the trackpad.  It had that annoying tendency of jumping the cursor just as you went to click the button part of the pad.  You're better off using the tap to click as that avoids the jumping.  BTW, it seems the trackpads on many of the new devices coming out are a bit flaky.I wasn't impressed with Chrome OS.  It didn't seem snappy or fast or robust.  Once again it felt like a big regression from using Windows 7 or 8 or Android 4.2.  I kept wanting to touch the screen as I'm spoiled by touch enabled devices and thought how much I'd rather just spend a little more (well actually about double more) and get a Windows 8 touchscreen device.

My iPad mini is too difficult for typing notes.I was able to use a MacBook Pro silicone keyboard protector for the Chromebook, but I had to trim the edges. They keys are very much like a Mac's, which is another reason I decided to go with this instead of a typical Acer netbook. Much easier for me on switching between laptops.I ignored any of the poor reviews about the video playback because I didn't need that. The screen is odd to me. The closest thing I can think of to describe it is that it's like an LCD TV. Very matte but sharp in a way. Check it out at Best Buy to see if it bothers you or not. The Acer Chromebook has a glass-like screen which I would have preferred. But this had better specs: 6.5 hrs battery life + 2.4 lbs vs. 3 hrs + 3 lbs.I wasn't too familiar with Chrome OS, but I had the browser on my Macbook. It syncs up pretty well and all of my bookmarks/apps/history/cache transferred nicely (the browser is attached to the google account you use for the browser/GDrive). I'd recommend downloading and playing around with the Chrome Browser to see if you are okay using it. The OS seems to be completely based around the Chrome browser and its apps.The speakers are surprisingly strong and are under the laptop near the front feet.

The power button is lit but the screen is asleep. I had to hold the power button until the machine turns off... and then turn it back on.Many others have this problem and the current go-arounds are switching to the beta channel (since Google is aware of the problem and apparently fixed it in the next update) or logging off before you close it (which I prefer... but looking forward to the update).My two cents:Keep in mind that this, much like other programs, is a work in progress and requires a certain amount of patience and perspective. Google isn't afraid to have people experimenting with the products to make them better. Contrary to other unhappy users, I don't feel as if Google/Samsung have cheated me in any way and I think the pros are outweighing the cons. I mean, why do people think there are always new versions of everything? Mac OSX 10.8.2, Windows 8, etc. There will always be bugs that will have to be worked out and Chrome is a young OS. If anything, I feel like we're helping the OS reach its potential.*UPDATE* (6 months later)I haven't had problems with the Chromebook since the sleep problem and that was fixed a week after I wrote that.The Chromebook has been working just fine!", "Date": "January 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beware of printer hook-up", "Author": "Buyer127", "ReviewID": "RASCHE5OHXYAK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Samsung Chromebook itself works well and is reasonably responsive for light to moderate internet use.

It is absolutely fabulous. I have been using it every day for over week now. It really can do just about anything my laptop could do, as well as my desktop.  A desktop is required for storage, burning DVD's and the like as there is no optical drive on the Chromebook. The hard drive is also very small, by today's standards.However, with the available Chrome extensions; tasks such as documents, spread sheets, reading books and basic computer games are all a breeze. Not to mention of course, the internet and email.Battery life is amazing. Upon getting it, I charged it, once it was fully charged, it lasted 2-1/2 days of off and on use for hours at a time - battery was down to 34%. Charging it is also quite fast. At that point, it took 1-1/2 hours to fully charge *while* using it!Set up? There is none. Turn it on, if you are good to go. If you are already a Chrome user, everything is right there for you. There are some minor adjustments/tweaking you can make such as desktop background, font size and scrolling method. It really could not be more simple.The screen size, 11.7\" is quite adequate, the touch pad is HUGE and very easy to navigate even for me who has always had a problem using touch pads. Not with this. It takes a few times to learn the finger(s) gestures for right click type commands, but from then on, it's a breeze. I did try using a USB mouse and it worked, but it was a bit sluggish. But again, it is quite easy to navigate using the touchpad and I really have not needed to use a mouse.At 2.4 pounds and less than 1/2\" thick, I am looking forward to putting this in my backpack on my next vacation as opposed to the Netbook or laptop!  I had read some reviews that the case scratches easily? So far, I've not found that to be true. But then, I am not a child and do use care when using my electronics. I bought the Case Logic LAPS-111 sleeve and it fits snugly and was a good investment since it doesn't add much to the size of the Chromebook, yet offers more than enough protection.Two days after getting this, I sold my laptop and Netbook - there was no need for either. I love that as soon as you open the lid,it is instant on. I really cannot say enough good things about this product.  If you're on the fence about buying one of these?

I read many reviews before I made my purchase, so I already knew what I was getting. I have a Windows 7 desktop and 2 Sony laptops, so I really didn't need my Chromebook for the functions for which I use my regular computers (mostly image and video editing). I needed a fast and simple path online and something more portable than my laptops, but still with a full-size keyboard. My Chromebook was the perfect solution. It starts almost instantly, and I'm online before my other computers are finished booting. It's very light and perfect for travel, and I have been getting more than 6 hours of use from the battery-- sometimes even 7 hours. I'm very happy with the suite of Google applications included. I had never used GoogleDocs before, but I found it easy to use, and for me, preferable to Word. I like that I can export from the Google applications to Microsoft applications if I need to, but mostly I simply keep my documents online in my GoogleDrive-- which I also love. With the Android GoogleDrive app on my phone, I have access to my files all of the time. The Chromebook is fast enough when I am surfing online, and I have never had any problems-- even with watching HD movies on Netflix. It is very convenient that the Chromebook has 2 USB ports (1 USB 3.0), an SD card slot, and an HDMI port. My USB ports instantly recognized my terabyte portable drive and every other USB storage device that I connected (also my wireless mouse, which I prefer over the trackpad). The HDMI port means that I don't need any other device to stream movies to my high definition television. I simply plug in my Chromebook into a TV HDMI port, and I'm ready to go. The Chrome operating system has been much improved (as promised) since I bought my Chromebook. Originally, the picture viewer would frequently hang up when viewing a large number of files, and the movie player couldn't play .AVI movies from my external drive without sputtering and skipping frames. After several automatic updates, both issues have been completely resolved. (The music player does not play .wma files, so you will have to convert them to .mp3.) I'm very happy with my Chromebook.

There are a ton of keyboard short-cuts (remember WordPrefect?  Yeah, it's like that!)*  Touchpad is decent but has no buttons.  The gestures are a little different than Windows/Mac.  Will take some getting use to.*  Light weight because of mostly plastic materials.  Doesn't scream cheap but it may not hold up too well in the long run.  However I do love the design.*  The screen hinge is on top so the screen won't open all the way flat (viewing angle is still good thou).*  Battery charges fully in about 2 hours and last about 4 hours watching mostly videos.*  Video runs smoothly.*  Great WIFI antenna.*  Gets a little warm sitting on the lap.For me, both the Apple iPad and the Android tablets failed to become my full-time computer replacement.

Over all it's really nice, no fan, runs quietly, no overheating. It doesn't have a caps lock button :/ but that doesn't really bother me. It might just have a shortcut to use it but haven't looked for that yet. Surfing the net is great and again...it's so darn light. Only thing I don't like is the fact that as long as someone has a google account, they can add user and sign in so be careful as it can be stolen easily and secondly, it restarts automatically for updates. So u'll be doing work or watching a video and the screen would blank out to update which is like literally 2 seconds. Good thing is that the work is saved already so you don't lose it and everything that was open at the time automatically reopens. The updates don't happen that often. It just gets annoying when u're watching a movie cuz it starts over and u have to skip through lol. I would definitely look past that minor problem and refer this to a friend which I have already done so get one if u're thinking about it.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Fit!", "Author": "Annaliese", "ReviewID": "R3V80SM3O6BIT5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a simple computer to do the most basic functions (i.e. web surfing, blogging, document creation, etc.) and this was a slam dunk.

I know I have not seen anyone with it or really read any reviews on it. Well guess what I got one to review. I was shocked at how small and thin it was. Plugin right out the box its ready to set up. As a mom i was worried about it getting too hot and burning one of the kids, My old laptop would leave places on my leg if i had it on my lap but this thing is hardly warm after using it all day. Now its not like any other computer everything is done in the cloud nothing is saved on your computer but a few things. Mostly just you logon info and settings. Now don't worry if you end up needing help its much easier to find and get it then any other computer. It charged in just a few hours. I will tell you that the power last longer than my old laptop I had a few years ago. I even can fit in my purse with no issues and my back doesn't hurt after word. Oak has even got a hold of it a few times. As a mom I really love it. Now as a tech there are a few things that are drawbacks. Java does not work with it, which is fine if you use it for simple everyday things. It is great for blogging and I do recommend it for bloggers here is why. You get a large amount of google drive space free. If you install chrome on your PC you can sync all your bookmarks and files in just a few sec. I use an android phone so all my bookmarks are synced on it too. It makes it so easy to blog on the go. Now because everything is on the cloud you use apps just like on android phones. It does take sometime to get use too using but if you go threw the get started screen you will understand it in no time. The cost is well worth it.

The problem with a web-based OS is that it's completely useless without a connection. And during the times that it can connect, I oftentimes have to refresh the tab before the page renders (otherwise, I get an error about the website not being available).The pages load very very slowly, too.

I currently own a fast gaming PC and i don't have an iPad or any other way to browse the web elsewhere other than my computer desk. The battery life lasts easily through a day and when i lightly use it i only need to charge it every third day. The only con is that the webcam isnt good at all (i dont use it anyways, but for $250 you get what you pay for) and the plastic body gets scratched really easy. If you have a case for when it is not being used you shouldn't run into the issue i ran into.Personally, i cannot stand super slow web browsing, but the Chromebook is speedy even when i have around 5 tabs open.

It makes it easy for you to control a computer at home remotely with your Chromebook through the internet.  It is easy to set up and it works great (as long as you have a decent internet connection wherever you are).

On the other hand, it seems to discharge quickly in storage.  I think it  has something to do with how you shut it down, but it isn't obvious.  It should probably default to a full shutdown when you close the lid, or have some way of detecting when it is discharging while doing nothing.It is also odd to have a device which is so internet (and Google) dependent.

(While I originally considered an ultra-book, I decided to keep separate applications with sensitive data like Quicken from other cloud-based documents. Based on that concern, I elected to maintain a home-based laptop and to buy the Chrome Book for on the go.) At $249, you cannot beat the price for the Chrome Book.The Chrome Book is extremely light-weight (~2 pounds) and meets my standards for portability. The keyboard is very comfortable and easier to use than a touch screen with either a stylus or an add-on keyboard. (I admit that I find it challenging to type on a touch screen and that I don't like fingerprints.) The device looks stylish.From a set-up perspective, it is important to ensure that your wi-fi encryption is set to WPA2. (Our router was originally set to use the older standard of WEP.) When I first turned on the Chrome Book, the device was extremely slow - taking many minutes to access a web page. As soon as I changed the encryption standard, the Chrome Book speed became good and responsive. If you are currently using WPA2, set-up is as easy as turning on the device and signing into Gmail.If you don't have wi-fi access, the Chrome Book does allow you off-line access to both Gmail and Google Drive.To gain full utility from this device, you need to buy-in to using Gmail and Google Drive. (You can access MS Office docs on a flash drive.) I have been impressed by the collaboration capabilities with Documents on Drive. (If you are committed to using Outlook or another reader to access your mail locally, the Chrome Book will NOT work for you.)Google makes available 100GB of storage on Drive for 2 years if you buy a Chrome Book. In order to take advantage of this storage, you need to search for Chrome Book \"goodies\" online.A disappointment with the Chrome Book is that you cannot access the New York Times application with off-line availability. (You can sign in and read the NY Times with the Skimmer application. You need wi-fi connectivity to use the Skimmer.) While I pay for an online Times subscription, the Chrome tablet application will not work. Every time you try to access an article, it prompts you to log-in but it then routes you back to the home page instead of opening the article. (If you look at the reviews on the Chrome Store web site, many users report the same problem.)While the Kindle Cloud application will allow you to access your newest book via the Chrome Book, it will not allow you to access your subscriptions.)I think this is a good device if you want a portable gadget for office functionality. If you are traveling and want access to entertainment, I don't think this is the optimal device.

This is a great small, light laptop that's great use when lounging on the couch or to travel with, especially when your main focus is to simply browse the web. There are certainly other useful ways to use this (games and apps), but I think the target audience here are people that prefer to browse the web on a device with a keyboard (which sets this apart from a tablet), and may use it for other tasks sporadically.The one issue I have is that I tend to have \"heavy hands\" when I type or use the track pad. By this, I mean that I put a lot of weight on the palms of my hands on each side of the track pad (below the keys). I use a 13\" macbook as my main computer and this has never been an issue; however, with the plastic construction, this is an issue with the chromebook.The issue is when I use the track pad with my right hand. I leave my left palm resting to the left of the track pad and when I do, \"clicking\" the trackpad by pressing down doesn't work. There is a software feature which allows you to tap the mouse for clicks, but the issue I'm talking about is the physical click by depressing the track pad. The times this is most noticeable are the following:- When resting the laptop on a soft surface, such as your lap- When the laptop is on a hard surface, but the front of the laptop hangs over the edge a bit.- This is kind of hard to explain, but sometimes when I'm walking around with my laptop, I hold it with my left hand with my four fingers on the bottom of the left side, and my thumb on the top, squeezing on the laptop with a firm grip. This allows me to use the trackpad when I'm standing, walking around...  When holding the laptop like this, the trackpad click also fails. This is probably not a practice done my most people though :)* If the chromebook is on a hard surface (table) without hanging over the edge, this issue is not seen.What's more interesting is that this only happens if your hand is pressed down on the left side of the track pad. If you use your left hand to control the track pad, (with a heavy right hand), you won't notice this issue.I think having a macbook with it's aluminum unibody has given me bad habits because the construction is so solid, but when we're talking about a $1,500 price difference between the macbook and chromebook, I think it's understandable. The chromebook is a $250 laptop and you can't expect the construction to be on par with macbook. This is just a small annoyance and when it happens, I just have to remember to lift my left hand to allow the the track pad to work properly.Aside from that, I love the chromebook and find myself using it more than my macbook now because it's so light and convenient -- not to mention, you feel more comfortable casually carrying it around since you are less concerned with damaging an electronic device that is so cheap :).Sorry, one more thing -- There is no right-click with the chromebook -- you use a two finger click for a right-click functionality (one finger for left click). I like this, but when you are using multiple laptops, it's easy to forget.**** Update ****I have a terrible time streaming youtube vidoes which is why I'm assuming netflix is STILL not supported. Youtube definitely has its own issues, but I have streamed the same video side-by-side with my chromebook and macbook, and have no issues with the macbook. Furthermore, my download speed is 45mbps and upload is 5mbps, so this is not a bandwidth issue.You can pause the video and allow it to buffer (youtube only buffers so much so it may be necessary to pause several times while watching a video), but should that really be necessary? Chromebook has capable hardware, so this must be a software issue. They have fixed another major annoyance I had to deal with for a few weeks (chromebook wouldn't \"wake up\" when opening the lid and a hard reboot was necessary). I hold out hope this will also be addressed, but I would probably give this review 3 1/2 stars at this point and find myself having to switch back to my macbook more and more.If you like to stream a lot of video, I would NOT recommend this laptop at this point :)", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Simple to operate", "Author": "Michael Grattan", "ReviewID": "RT5H3AOGVL80V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I work in IT and am a firm believer in the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) rule.

It is fast and easy to use. It feels like a Mac.Buy two or three. They really are a nice machine for cruising the web and working with cloud based applications.They are not a primary computer though.

I went through the steps on my mac to configure the printer and share it with my son's account so that he could print. For some reason I couldn't get it to work (but was able to follow the steps pretty easily), he still could not print.  So ok, maybe that is just a technical issue that can be resolved, but read below.Also it is unclear but I'm fairly certain this other computer (used to configure the printer) has to actually be on and in the house. So that is a big drawback especially since my printer is a laptop I carry with me. So the chromebook could be home and I could be out and my son won't be able to print (even if we solved the technical issue in paragraph 1).So bottom line is that printing is an issue. To get around this, for a paper my son had to hand in at school, he wrote it on his chromebook, shared it with me via Google docs and I opened it on my mac and printed it.

Seriously, the approx. $100 prepaid for two years of lightweight 3g service is money well spent.o  The iPearl hardshell case is unobtrusive and adds some needed rigidity and protection.o  If you plan on taking this device anywhere I think a protection plan is a good idea.

All in all, it is very good. Not excellent, but very good. The pros: it turns on in only a few seconds, it is super light, the battery life is wonderful, I can write documents on Google Docs and do all the interneting I need to. The cons: it is definitely not a laptop. Google Docs and all the other Word-analogous programs are ok, but inferior to Word. There are just so many little things that Google Docs cannot do. I can't figure out how to make my default text anything besides Ariel size 11. I can't copy and paste more than one image at once. If I export a Google Doc as a Word Doc, the margins will be messed up. And, most frustratingly, somehow Times New Roman size 12 font is larger in Google Docs than it is in Microsoft Word, because if I copy and paste something it'll be a different length. Also, be warned: Google Spreadsheets are FAR inferior to Excel. They cannot do trend lines, which is kind of the most important thing that a spreadsheet analysis program does (for me, at least), so that's unfortunate. Google Drive will just NOT sync with my files on my laptop, even when I let it upload for hours and it says it's finished. I have to upload everything directly with Chrome, I can't rely on putting files in the folder that shows up in the My Computer tab. For some reason my mouse will disappear periodically and it takes a few minutes of frantic clicking and/or typing before it will reappear. And my Chromebook is only three months old. Basically, what I've had to do is cut back my real laptop use to just Excel and other programs I need for work, and then use the Chromebook for all the internet and writing I have to do. Which is working fine, and definitely hurt my wallet less than a new computer would have. The Chromebook is great for carrying around and using on the go. But it is not a computer, and the limited functions it has probably don't cut it (as the only computer-like device) for a lot of people these days. The Chromebook probably would be great for kids or older people who only need word processing and the internet though.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, with some flaws", "Author": "Hi Desert", "ReviewID": "R1HK346N8VH99H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this computer to use for taking online college classes. The speed of the wifi, ease of setup (really, there's essentially no setup), battery life, and price are exceptional. The keyboard is good -- nice satisfying feel, although not on part with a desktop's keyboard. In general I've found the system easy to use, but there are a few exasperating things about Chrome that will pop up now and again and leave me tearing out my hair. For instance: you can't access documents stored on the computer when you're offline (or maybe you can and I haven't figured it out yet). It's also difficult to find documents on the computer, say something that you downloaded. This system is obviously set up to work online, and only online. Google's apps like Sheet and Doc work pretty well, but if you're used to Microsoft you'll find that Google's products are generally awkward and slightly inferior reproductions. They do, however, work for all your basic needs and the free online storage lets me access them at home, work, wherever I can get online. If you can work exclusively online and need to surf the web, write basic documents, and want an inexpensive way to do it, this chromebook is a solid choice -- just not perfect.

I'll speak personally from how this has helped me in my specific situation, in case there is someone who may be in a similar situation.There are a few things about me that made me a great fit for this product:1) I own a desktop computerThere are some things I need a desktop for, and I have a desktop computer for those occasions. Interestingly, one of the things I learned is how little I really needed my desktop. I packed it away and didn't bother unpacking it for two months now. If anything it's probably a good thing that I can't play video games on this thing, so if you're a recovered game addict with relapsing tendencies (like yours truly), that's something to consider. But there are some things I'll definitely need the desktop for, such as photo editing, which I will eventually need to unpack the desktop to do.2) I use Google everything (gmail, drive, calendar, etc.)And so do a lot of my friends, making it very easy to work on Google and share my work with others. The suite of Google office products are pretty handy, and for most uses is more than sufficient. Because google docs do not count against your size limit on Google Drive, it feels like unlimited storage to me, and I've done just fine without any additional storage.3) I use Amazon Prime (mainly for movies, Kindle books)The vast majority of \"apps\" that you can add on the chromebook do little more than provide you a link, turning the bottom bar into a glorified \"favorites\" bar. The kindle is one exception, since you are able to download books for offline reading. Since I watch all my movies through Amazon Prime, it's not a big deal that there's no DVD player.4) I intend to carry this around all over the placeThis is ideal for carrying around because it's light and thin (I just leave it in my bag and I never think \"dang it, I shouldn't have brought my laptop today\") the battery life is great (I never really have to bring the charger unless I forgot to charge it the night before) and it's cheap (I've dropped it and I've dropped the bag it's in many times, but it hasn't broken yet, and I wouldn't be totally bummed as I would be if I dropped some other really expensive thin light laptop).5) The places I go have wifi anywayStarbuck's, McDonald's, school, library, etc. In my neighborhood there are a lot of places to go for free wifi.A few reasons why this product was not a good fit:1) Skydrive is not that good.This isn't Google's fault, but it does affect my review of whether or not you should buy this chromebook, because the chromebook is only as good as the apps that what it can run in the browser. The truth is that Skydrive is nowhere close to the much more robust Google Drive. It technically does a lot of the same things, and in some ways it is indeed better than Google drive at handling MS Office documents, but I've had too many instances where the website would fail and I would lose something I had been working on. No matter how many bells and whistles it has, the fact that it can't reliably work on things has made me lose hope on skydrive, so now if I really want to fine-tune a MS Office document, I have to find a PC.2) It's kind of weak sauce.It's okay with most things, and I can watch movies on it full-screen, but sometimes it's just slow, especially if you have a lot of tabs open. I've learned to be a lot more disciplined about tab-closing, and that's helped, but at some point the thing is just slow, and when I'm trying to work with two windows at the same time, scheduling things and responding to e-mails and such, there's a slight lag that will make things take longer than they would otherwise.CONCLUSION:If you're a no-frills kind of person and you're looking for something like this, then I recommend it, especially if you're broke like me. It doesn't have a lot of (or any, really) bells or whistles, but it can get quite a bit done. The times are a-changin', and as the cloud expands in the size and diversity of products they offer, this will become even more useful over time.", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "One of a kind laptop.", "Author": "jeffdell91", "ReviewID": "R2VA2ZP84802UL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This Chromebook is a great laptop.

The laptop is very aesthetically pleasing and takes many design cues from Apple's Macbook Air. It is very sturdy and feels \"dense and significant\" despite its  extremely light weight.The only drawback I've found so far is that in stead of a Caps-Lock button, there is a \"search\" button. This is particularly a problem for me because I am one of the (apparently) few people who use the Caps-Lock instead of the shift button. However, it is  especially a problem because the search button interrupts my typing when I forget to use the shift key. In fact, I've done it several times during this review. This may not be a problem for most people, but its worth pointing out in case anyone is like me.All in all, this is a great device.

My mother got it for me for Christmas(I am using her account to write this), after I was saving up for it for 6 months. I did not figure that mom would get it for me, so I chose the cheapest but best quality laptop I could find. This seemed perfect for me, considering that I usually only use the internet on the family computer. I looked forward to all the features that this computer held. It seemed perfect. Now, after trying it, my first impression is that it is not as good as I imagined it, but for a first laptop, it does not disappoint.  The Chromebook is very small and lightweight, making it easy to carry around. The design is very sleek and modern, with very nice color, if a bit dull. I am considering buying a skin for it, but if not, it is still very nice. The keyboard is amazing. The keys are just far enough away to make it easy to type. There are a few downsides, though. For one thing, there is no caps lock. It is slightly unnerving, since I am used to it being where the search button is now. I am sure I will get used to it after a while. The only other problem is one of my keys, the \"W\", does not work well. It keeps getting stuck. I am pretty sure that is not for all the Chromebooks, though. Other than those problems, the keyboard manages to hold up to it's expectations. I was a bit confused about where the charger hole was. It and the audio jack are very similar looking, but the charger hole is smaller and on the back. After only a little time, the computer started getting warm, but not too terribly. In fact, it is quite nice for the winter. Overall, the design seemed to be nearly as I hoped it would be, just with a couple small problems.  Setup was much simpler than I thought that it would be. You just have to connect to your internet and log into Google. The update took a bit, but that was expected. It was ready within minutes, and I did not have to get help from anyone else (like I usually do, not being very tech savvy). This was very nice. The getting started page that comes up once you finish setting it up was very helpful, and quickly taught me the basics of the Chromebook.  I have not tried out all the apps, but the ones I have tried seem to work well. The camera is very nice, although I wish that you were able to make videos. However, when you save a picture from the camera into the file app, it is unable to open it. Apparently, I need to get an app that can open the picture. I looked online, and am unable to find such app. If you know what app I need, please tell me, so that I can actually open pictures from the camera app. Other apps I used included Google documents, calculator, and scratchpad. All seem to work fine.  Internet has no large problems apart from the inability to use Netflix. Everything seems to work quickly and nicely. Sound and screen are okay, but not amazing. I have seen better, but I have seen way worse. Battery life seems to be nice.  So all in all, my first impression is that it does nicely for a first computer, or maybe as a secondary computer.

Don't have enought experience to give it a higher review, but I am raising it from a one to a three because it works, but the instructions need work.

My other complaint is that Google won't give the 100GB chromebook storage offer to this particular Chromebook for whatever reason. I was hoping to have the storage for this since it's so small but now I'm going to have to use flash drives and NAS storage. Other than that though, it's been great.

Now when it's too loud it vibrates the plastic itself making this horrible sound. It's solved by lowering the volume or holding down the side with the speaker but it's kinda sad that it's just starting to do this for really no real reason.EDIT 4 5/26/2014: Now the door for the SD card bay just broke for no reason.

The idea appeals to me because I have Google deeply integrated into my work life. I wanted to like this version but wish I could send it back. The first Chromebook I bought was a Samsung 12.5\" with an Atom processor. The same problem plagued that model as the newer version. Its too slow and the system strains under any load beyond the most basic work. In reference to the newer Samsung, one reviewer said that video runs fine as long as its less than 1080P. I find any video viewing to be irritating to deal with because it is so slow to start. The same reviewer wrote you could open 6 tabs at the same time without degrading performance. I have not found that to be true. The track pad is better on the new model than the old one but still falls short in smooth and accurate performance. I like the keyboard on both models except for the the lack of a forward erasure key. From a layman's perspective it seems to me this unit would profit greatly from a better processor and/or more memory. Perhaps that would require a fan.

I bought mine thinking it would be something akin to a real computer and I've been unpleasantly surprised ever since when I wanted to do things like play games, write documents, experiment with doing simple coding etc.  The other big problem I have with it is that it is a continuation of the Google tracking model where they collect your personal data and send it out to third parties for profit.  There's a free OS out there called Chromium which the Google modify for these systems so that it syncs in with the wider Google complex allowing them to track you better.

I am a student of linguistics, so I need to have PRAAT software on my computer. I also need to have a compiler like Code::Blocks for the electives in computer science I took. I need to have everything backed up multiple times: in the cloud, on the hard-drive, and on an external hard drive, as well.  Can my Samsung Chromebook do all that? Not really.However, the Chromebook is super lightweight, it stays charged for far longer than all my laptops and tablets, it even gives the option of linking this Chromebook to my desktop pc (that is Chrome\u2019s remote access and it is available on the Chromebook already, but you will need to download remote access to your second device in order to connect)! It does have the basics for me: google docs (like word), google slides (like powerpoint), google sheets (like excel) and google photos. It also has shortcuts to youtube, which I have found to be convenient.I use it mainly for writing, reading emails, and combing through the library\u2019s academic journal databases. If I was allowed to install software, I would have more programs running on this than there is right now. As is, I cannot install PRAAT, nor Code::Blocks, which is frustrating. Now, when I need to write code or record audio files, I bring my other Samsung laptop, the Samsung series 7 gamer, orange laptop. I hate doing this. I don\u2019t like taking my gaming laptop outside of the house because it was expensive and it weighs a lot (and has a 17.3 inch screen). So, I have my everyday, minimalist Chromebook with me almost all the time and when I don\u2019t it is because I needed a specific program to run and Chromebook cannot run outside software. This is the Chromebook\u2019s achilles heel, and when I need something not so minimalist, I have to lug around my gaming laptop and leave the Chromebook at home.This works for me, mainly because I already own a collection of electronics and I have back-up computers lying around. If you are strapped for cash, however, and you need your Chromebook to allow programs like SPSS (statistics software) to be installed, I would recommend you look at another computer. I understand that outside software can have security problems, but that is the internet in general at the moment, and the fact that I cannot install software programs is the main reason for the 2 star deduction. I would love to give this Chromebook five stars! Sadly, the issue with the lack of available software programs deserves a 1 star deduction.The other star deduction is because google is attempting to recreate major applications in their own style (i.e. Google sheets versus Microsoft Word and Secure Shell app for Code::Blocks). This counts as a star deduction because I then had to spend a prolonged period of time researching which google app equivalent I needed, hunt it down, add it, and then learn how it works. For example, Code:Blocks is straightforward. Secure Shell (which I used in my introduction to programming class) is structured differently. At first, I spent about an hour reading through internet forums about how to write code in Chromebooks. I finally found Secure Shell, but by that time I was frustrated. I can only imagine what this would be like for someone who does not have backup computers.I guess what I am trying to say is that one must buy a Chromebook already prepared to learn new software applications, because you will. Also, it is a bit puzzling to find downloads. Everything opens up on the web and saves to the web. One has to fiddle with the control panel to save it offline.Here are the reasons for my three stars: superlight weight! Compact! Charge lasts a long time! No need for anti-virus! The Chromebook\u2019s minimalist approach can be seen as a positive for some people! As soon as I lift the lid up, my Chromebook powers up in seconds! Inexpensive! Everything saves to the Cloud! I recommend the Chromebook for anyone who needs something only for essential cloud-based tasks. It also seems like it would make a cheap alternative for students at Universities, especially if their campus is like mine and spends quite a bit of money enticing students to walk in and buy a macbook...To sum up, the Chromebook is a minimalistic computer that works better than great for basic tasks but is below par when it comes to ease of use (because of all the googling I had to do to find the equivalent of Code:Blocks and Audacity) and functionality.One last note, I tried connecting a classroom projector to my Chromebook in order to show a powerpoint presentation, all to no avail. The Chromebook projected only the wallpaper on my screen (a picture of a fox), and completely ignored the google slides presentation that was clearly visible on the computer screen. I never did learn how to make that work.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": "11.6 inches Display\nSamsung Exynos 5250 Dual Core Processor\n2 GB DDR3L RAM 16 GB Solid
