I ordered a T530 and received a T61 instead!  I was so pissed, but I decided to review it and give it a chance anyway.  After close examination I discovered a few things:1.  It wasn't a 2.66 dual core, but a 2.33 dual core instead.2.  It said 4GB when i bought it, but received a 2GB system instead.  Was it faulty advertizing?  Did they really mean expandable to 4GB?3.  It did not have an NVIDIA NVS 5400M, Intel HD 4000 Graphics Card4.  It did not have a 500GB HDDYet, I will keep it, because for the price, it is still a reasonable deal.  However, its the principal of the matter.  I do not like to be deceived.", "Date": "August 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B008AZT4W2"}}
