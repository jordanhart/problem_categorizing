{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An In-depth review", "Author": "Jon G. \"Avid Gamer and Tech\"", "ReviewID": "R38BX7N5NOTB02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "**This review was originally written for the M17xr4 with 7970m graphics, 1600x900 screen, i7 3610m processor, and 6gb RAM, which i own. That being said, the rest is the same and the processor difference is very, very minimal since the 3630 is simply the \"refresh\" of the 3610, and NOT a new generation of processor. Anything marked** may not apply to the model you have purchased.Now, on to the review. I will try to give an unbiased opinion as I have done months and months of research, comparing and contrasting every modern gaming laptop. This review will be fairly in depth (Should be for a $1800+ laptop), and I will try to be detailed, but also universal in describing details, so that you don't have to know any extreme technical jargon to understand the review as well as giving an up-to-date one. Enough said.The Build:First things first the build quality is excellent, and this will be the first thing you notice as you un-box and remove it from its protective casing. I researched for months on purchasing a high-end/Gaming computer, and i have learned very much about numerous modern gaming computers and components. Most of the reviews on amazon and on review websites have stated its build quality is of the highest grade and that it is one of the biggest selling points for this laptop, and for good reason. The laptop feels solid, secured, and a bit heavy (weighs in at about 9.5lbs). In my opinion, not overweight considering the amount of components stuffed into this thing. The rubbery matte texture compliments it's sturdiness well, and to me was a great material choice for this laptop as it resists fingerprints rather well and will not show scratches as aluminum or plastic will. Not to mention keeping the laptop light, and relatively cool. I dare you to find a better looking laptop (my opinion) that is more sleek and with better build quality (not opinion) than this one. The reason i put up with the weight over say a Sager NP9170 is that this M17xr4 is the thinnest 17inch gaming laptop with these components i could find. I'll take thinner to lighter any day considering, i will be hauling this in a excellent backpack (Everki Beacon or swiss gear) Where the 1 to 2 pound gain over the NP9170 will not be noticeable. Your port selection is numerous and above average, even for gaming laptops. 4 USB 3.0 ports (2 on the left, 2 on your other left), 1 USB 2.0/Esata combo (right) which is also a sleep and charge port which does just that (allows you to charge your phone, iPod or usb charging device while the laptop is asleep or even completely off). VGA, HDMI and Display port video outs (all left), 2 headphone jacks, 1 mic input, as well as an SPDIF optical out (All left). One cool feature is that the Soundcard software included can be used to configure the audio ports to do anything, For example configure all 4 ports to be headphone jacks, or 2 line -in ports. An HDMI-in (right) (not existent in any other laptop I could find. Trust me, I looked. More on this in \"other features\" below). Last but not least a 9 in 1 card reader above the optical drive (right) and a Kensington lock (left). The cooling system is well engineered with 3 intakes on the bottom, and 2 exhausts on the back, the left one being for the processor, and the right being for the graphics card. I can't tell you how nice it is having the exhaust shoot out the back instead of the bottom into your lap. You might think you lap will block the intakes but they are almost designed with a peak and valley structure, to allow lap use without block to the intakes. Don't get me wrong this laptop can get warm on the bottom especially during gaming, but it is rare I game on my lap. And when using a laptop pad or cooling pad, you won't notice it at all \uf04a. The individual laptop exhausts are nice, first they limit noise to 1 fan most of the time, secondly they are effective and accurate at temp detection (i.e. Gaming, the GPU fan ramps up, Heavy app use or multitasking the CPU fan ramps up) not to mention the entire system is silent during basic and medium use.Components:I will go into greater detail of the components i have added separately or replaced later in the review. For now, the components it comes with. First off the processor, The Intel i7 3630m is the baseline mobile model for i7 cores in laptops. It is snappy, and has no problem devouring numerous tasks at a time. For gaming an i7 core IS MORE than enough considering most games don't utilize 4 cores to begin with (exception: Farcry 3). In fact you would do just fine for gaming if this laptop had an i5 core and you would not notice a frame rate difference.**On to the Graphics, this laptop uses a combination of AMD Radeon 7970m ( Nvidia 675m on this model) discrete or dedicated card, in concurrence with an Intel HD 4000 integrated chip. First the 7970m, this is a nasty card that destroys most any game, modern or old. You can comment on this review, and I can test a game you might want me to play and let you know how it preforms. To name a few recent ones it preforms extremely well with that I have played. Black ops 2 (not very difficult for any machine), Battlefield 3 run great maxed out, Arkham city runs great, Farcry 3 runs insane on this laptop due to its great scaling on all 4 processor cores (all though I have had some crashes with this game). I've even played as recent as the Crysis 3 beta which runs great since the new drivers update. I cannot stress this enough, the ability to play such high-end games with such good results, all on-the-go, is a crazy feat to me. I run this laptop to a 27 inch monitor most of the time and it's hard to believe the graphics are coming from my laptop and not a desktop. Comparing it to the GTX 680m recently released by Nvidia, the 7970m in my opinion is on par with it, and even runs certain games better according to benchmarks. That being said in power consumption and cooling is better with the 680m. The biggest difference is the price. When I looked to configure my laptop on Dell or Xotic PC, the price difference is over $350 which is simply not justifiable, even for a Nvidia fan boy. I knew and researched both the 680m, 7970m before I even wanted to purchase here, so seeing that amazon had the 7970, it only pushed me further to buy here. Intel HD 4000 is simply an integrated graphics chip which is used for anything but high-end games and uses MUCH less power. Heck, it will even run older games or less resource hogging ones great. AMD uses \"Enduro\" technology to switch between the 2 graphics solutions based upon your power source (battery or plugged in) and application (Video game vs. Google chrome) this all can be configured manually, but by default your computer switches to the Intel HD 4000 when on battery power EVEN if you are trying to run a high-end game. But like I said, this can be changed manually with a combination of power and graphics setting changes. All that being said, the drivers are a bit faulty, especially with windows 8. I could not decide whether to install AMD's drivers for the 7970m from their website or Dell's which seemed outdated. I spoke to a few Alienware techs on this issue. All said that it is preferable to use Dell's drivers, but AMD's should be compatible. I noticed some performance loss using Dell's driver version, so I cleared the drivers completely and installed AMD's 13.2 version which had updates for the Crysis 3 beta.* For your hardrive and standard 7200rpm Seagate 750gb drive. Nothing special here. See my upgrade.* For RAM you got 6gb** (8gb on this model) of 1600mhz DDR3 ram in one 4gb stick and one 2 gb stick** (2x4 probably on this model). Fine amount of Ram,I was going to upgrade anyways so I didn't care.* Wi-Fi card is an Intel Centrino 2230, great reception, great speeds wireless N as well as 2.4ghz/5.8ghz bands. Not much else to say* Standard DVD/CDRW that is a slot-load drive. I happen to prefer slot-load over tray load because: one, sleeker looking, and 2 no worrying about having a clumsy tray slide out and hit something, getting stuck, breaking, etc.* For your sound card you get a SoundBlaster Recon3Di instead of a basic sound card, paired with a pair of Klipsch speakers, it sounds great. Where it really shines is when you hook this laptop up via optical or analog (stereo out) and tweak settings in the SoundBlaster control panel. I found the Rock preset to improve the sound even more. This excellent sound card is a rare and welcome addition to a gaming laptop. The speakers definitely aren't booming loud, but they are crisp, clean and have decent bass and are plenty loud for nearly any use. I think they could have used a slight volume boost in playing music, but with laptop speakers, it's tough considering power provided and space to put them in. The speakers are definitely above average and much better sounding than Sager or MSI laptops alike.**(This laptop does have the 1920x1080 Full HD Screen) The screen as stated before is 1600x900**, decent colors, so-so viewing angle. Before you write this laptop off for the screen resolution, consider these two things. First, at only 17 inches (yes only) you won't see a ginormous difference between 1920x1080, and 1600x900. You will probably see it. But is it worth 200 dollars extra upgrade? Your call. Secondly, I personally route to a 27 inch monitor for gaming which I display 1920x1080 on. If your majority, or even part of your use is to an external monitor: just another reason you don't need 1080p on the actual laptop screen.Personal Experience/Other selling points/Tips**The 3 largest selling points that had me choose this laptop over the Samsung series 7 gamer, MSI GT70, and the Sager NP9170 (in my opinion its top competitors) was first, the powerful graphics card which beats the 675m and lower cards (670m, 660m, etc.) by a large amount. I was aware of the driver issues with the 7970m but I decided to take the risk, trusting they will be updated (and they have and will continue to be).Secondly, the slim profile of this laptop. It beats all 3 mentioned AND has more powerful components. Now this laptop is nowhere near thin at about 1.98 inches but its as thin as its going to get for these components. You want super thin? Razer blade is $2599, and you get less powerful components than this laptop, but the razer blade is super portable (6lb,.88 inches thick).Thirdly, the icing on the cake for me (it might seem strange) the HDMI-input port. Why? The simple fact that being able to hook a console, Blu-ray player, or nearly any device to use this laptop, solely for use of its screen, is genius. Now I understand that some people do not have use for this feature because they do not own consoles or any form of device to utilize this feature and those that could have use for it might say, \"Why would you want to hook a console-- a less-powerful system--up to the screen of a more powerful system\" well I personally have many friends on console and we often have \"system link parties\" the idea that my laptop could serve as a screen instead of having to haul a TV or monitor to play on is awesome. Not to mention you feel as if you have full control over your laptop to do as you choose and knowing that by the time the computer gets outdated (not for many, many years), you could still always use it as a screen! I have used it with my Xbox 360 and it is excellent, just the right size, and the Xbox's sound even routes right through the HDMI and out the laptops speakers (HDMI carries audio and video). It was a huge selling point for me and NO OTHER laptop has one of these that I have found.Another minor cool feature I like is the speaker placement. Since I do use this on an external monitor I prefer to shut the laptop screen when doing that. This might not matter to most, but for me, when I do shut it and just prefer to use the excellent speakers on the laptop it will not block the sound. Why? The speakers on are the front of the laptop (the colored, grill looking things). With most laptops you have a sound bar near the media controls and if you were to shut the screen the speakers would get blocked. Being able to use the speakers with the screen closed is a cool feature for me.Another selling point for me personally, is it came with components that are hard to upgrade in a laptop that I wanted (7970m graphics**, i7 processor) and nothing I didn't want (6gb ram**, basic HDD). The laptop's accessibility is great. Pop the battery out, unscrew 2 screws, and you're in to most of the system. 2 of the 4 ram bays, HDD bay --which it has 2 of by the way--, fans, even your graphics and your processor can be seen. Again Alienware is giving you nearly full control of the system. Even the Wi-Fi card, other ram bays and optical drive are accessed through a little further, but not too difficult dis-assembly.Here are the upgrades I have chosen and installed myself easily:-Samsung 840 250gb SSD (purchased from Newegg for $150 with Farcry 3 Samsung MZ-7TD250BW 840 Series Solid State Drive (SSD) 250 GB Sata 2.5-Inch) an SSD is said to be the single best system upgrade you can make that will grant you the most noticeable performance boost to your system. And after installing one myself, I am a firm believer in just that. Honestly with processors so fast these days your limiting factor comes down to your HDD and good ol' disc drives can only spin to access data so fast. I would even go as far as to say if you don't get an SSD you're missing out on a chunk of your system's performance especially with a processor such as the i7 3610m. Not to mention SSD's silent, cooler, more reliable, and less power consuming operation than traditional HDD's as well as SSD prices dropping like crazy and 1 open bay in this laptop, what have you got to lose? Unleash your processor!-16gb Corsair vengeance laptop RAM (purchased from amazon for $84.99 Corsair Vengeance 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory (CMSX16GX3M2A1600C10)) I wanted more than 6gb of ram and if you go higher than 16gb its near impossible to stress it. This RAM had great reviews, fast speeds and seems reliable.-Killer Wireless N 1202, Faster 2.4/5.8 ghz speeds.-Windows 7 professional OEM (purchased on amazon for $102) I had a feeling I would not care for windows 8 (and I did not that much, not to mention the drivers for the 7970m are nearly unusable on win 8). Bought this fresh OEM copy at a steal price, popped in my new SSD did a fresh install, Used \"Sean's Windows 7 installation guide for SSD's\" Which you MUST checkout if you do similar configuration as I, with the hard drives. I then formatted my original 750 GB HDD to use for storage space, and boom. My system flies with cold boot times under 18 seconds, and massive amount of storage space. In the future I will definitely move to windows 8 once graphics drivers are updated and the OS becomes more stable. But for now, it's windows 7 professional for me. Your system didn't include Windows 8 recovery disks for when you want to upgrade? No problem. Call up Alienware, and they will 2-day ship you your recovery media on a handy, dandy flash drive.-One of the many accessories I suggest for this laptop is the U3 Coolmaster cooling pad Cooler Master NotePal U3 Laptop Cooling Pad with Three Configurable 80mm Fans (R9-NBC-8PCK-GP). The reason I liked this for my desk set-up is it seems of good material mostly aluminum which is naturally cool without fans! It uses USB power, fits the M17xr4 perfectly, and the fans are even movable, and Removable. I lined all 3 fans up directly with my m17x's, 3 intake vents which really keeps this thing cool. You do not need a cooling pad, just a personal choice for me! A cool system, is a happy system. The compatibility with my system made this one a winner for me, but I do use it as a stationary \"dock\" at desk, it's really too big to lug around. For more accessory suggestions, Comment!-Personally I use this laptop for school, web browsing/multitasking, high-end gaming, and a screen for my Xbox \uf04a. Even though it is heavy, and many will say it is only a desktop replacement. It is still portable and I have no problem using this computer around the house, on my lap, or \"docked\" at my desk.For purchasing locations I would suggest either here or Xoticpc.com. I chose here mostly because of the standard price and the partial refund I receive for the screen mess-up issue.I do highly suggest this laptop, and encourage you to research more sites for yourself to see if it will fit your uses. I only wish it took me less than 3 months to figure that out. But at such a high price I wanted to be 110% sure this was the one I wanted.Please feel absolutely free to comment with any at all questions, regarding why I chose the upgrades I did, or anything on the system I didn't touch on well enough, Specific Game performance, purchasing options, how to configure anything, component or accessory suggestions, or other laptop comparisons. I will do my absolute best to get back to you. Also let me know anywhere to improve on the review besides grammar (after a few pages I gave up ;). I will update this review with new info, and corrections.You have reached the end, congrats and thank you for your time if you have stuck with me, and if you did not stick with it, Hey, I don't blame your skimming.Thanks again.", "Date": "March 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Accept No Substitutes", "Author": "Jamey Olsen \"Keishidojo\"", "ReviewID": "RQ2GW2HZ0TPL3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Okay now I know this review comes in a little late, but I just picked up one of these bad boys and I am pretty computer/techno savvy so I thought I would share my thoughts.  Current systems I own MacPro 13\u201d, 24\u201d iMac, 27\u201d 3 custom built PCs, Motorola Xoom 10\u201d, Samsung Galaxy S4, Xbox 360, PS3.  So I feel it\u2019s safe to say I have some experience with most systems.I picked up this laptop used in excellent condition and very clean.  Came with all original equipment from Dell and I paid just over $1000.  So I got a great deal and saved a ton of money.  Now one reason I didn\u2019t go with the newest Alienware is the fact that there is no AMD graphics option and the system configuration I chose was $2899.90.First off I wanted a laptop with an (ATI) AMD graphics card, lighted keyboard and was upgradeable.  I choose AMD graphics as they render the image slightly different and I simply like their image quality better.  (I have both nVidia and AMD cards to make this statement).Now the version of this laptop I bought came with the 2.3 Ghz Intel I7 3610QM processor, 16GB of DDR 3 1600Mhz memory (upgraded from the standard 8GB), the AMD Radeon 7970M 2GB graphics card vs. the nVidia options, a 750GB mechanical HDD at 7200RPM, the Sound Blaster Recon 3Di sound card paired with Klipsch speakers, the 1900 x 1080P HD screen (upgraded from the 1600x900 screen), the Blu-Ray drive (upgraded from the standard DVD drive), and finally it has all the customization that makes the Alienware brand cool.I use this system to work on basic documents, presentations, web site (Microsoft Expression Web, Dreamweaver 8) creation and maintenance, image editing (Adobe CS6), basic entertainment (music listening while working, surfing, homework etc), and yes gaming.  Now I admit I am not gaming with the newest baddest games out there as I generally play the newer games on my Xbox.  (Just like trading games I finish to help offset the cost of the new blockbusters).  I play more classics on my systems (Half Life 1 & 2, AvP 2, Dungeon Siege 1 & 2, Unreal Tournament 1 and 2K4, Star Wars KoTOR 1 & 2, Jedi Academy, Jedi Outcast, Need for Speed Most Wanted, Command and Conquer Tiberium Wars, Supreme Commander 1 & 2, Warcraft 3, Mass Effect, X-COM Enemy Unknown, Star Craft 1 & 2, Insane 1 & 2, a little World of Warcraft ((for girlfriend)), and some Star War The Old Republic & the newer Marvel Heroes game.)  So I know none of the games I play are really pushing the system to the limit, but as I said I get my Batman Arkham Origins or Halo 4 on the Xbox.Now I have had the M17x R3 the MSI GT70 gaming laptop and have tried out the ASUS RoG systems and I can say I just like the Alienware computer better.  I love the customization, the build quality feels solid and to make upgrades the bulk of everything is all easy to get with the removal of 2 screws.  The only part I would have to say I didn\u2019t like is there are two ram slots under the keyboard, and those are the two that Dell/Alienware choose to leave blank vs. the 2 slots that are under the bottom cover.  (Dell, please reverse this process and leave the bottom 2 open to make less work to just add some memory.)Upgrades I plan on making here in the next few weeks.  A SSD will be the only thing I will likely add to this system as I had one in my R3 and MSI and it makes such a major difference in the performance and response times.  SSD have come down some in pricing over the past couple years and the Samsun 840 Pro or the newer EVO series are great.  I had/have  120GB in my old R3 and my current desktop, this time I will get a 240GB.  Other than that this system in it current configuration is perfect.Keys things to look for if your looking to get one.Which generation of Core I7 CPU your are getting.  Of course more often than not the newer the better.  Intel uses a pretty simple numbering system a 2nd gen is a I7 2XXX series, 3rd gen is I7 3XXX, and the new 4th gen is of course I7 4XXX.  16GB Ram is about the most ram most people will really need.  Games are not really taking advantage of more than 8gb, and other than graphics intensive editing I don't see the need for more.  SSD vs mechanical, and mechanical look for 7200RPM and not the slower 5400RPM.  Some laptops have 64GB SSD, or more and than use the 500+ GB for storage, and that's what I do too.  Video graphics preferences, most people have a name brand they prefer (like cars chevy vs. ford etc.)  Which is better is really up to you.  They go back n ofrth with the performance crown and then it depends on the game.  As I said I have them both and I like the image quality I get from AMD cards over nVidia.  I am willing to sacrifice a few frames per sec if the image is crisp and clear.  Finally is weight.  Gaming laptops are HEAVY, so don't buy one expecting iPad weights.  If you need to hit the gym and do some curls to be able to lift this 9lb bad boy (just a bit more than a gallon of milk).  But just know that they are all pretty heavy and don't complain about it later.If you are looking at a used gaming PC or have been trying to decide even between a last gen new one from ASUS, MSI or Alienware, I think if you choose the Alienware route you will not be disappointed.  Also some games and programs are supporting the AlienFX (lighting schemes) and integrate them into their games/programs and that makes for a really cool experience.Good luck and happy computing.", "Date": "January 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "The best laptop I've ever had", "Author": "MIke", "ReviewID": "R69YT3I5DHWFZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a hardcore gamer that is constantly on the move, so I needed a laptop that could keep up when my old laptop died.I've had problems with Dell PCs in the past, but I decided to give this laptop a shot because of all the really cool features it had.
