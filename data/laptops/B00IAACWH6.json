Asking yourself do I go with MSI, Alien, Clevo/Sager, Asus or any of the other major brands out there. Well let me attempt to save you some time as I've spent roughly 100hrs researching all of them before calming my nerves to hit the purchase button on this beast. So what do you get? Well for starters Asus is a well respected brand whom I here has great customer support, but I couldn't verify that first hand since none of my Asus products has ever failed me in any capacity. This G750-JZ is upgrading my G74SX which I bought years ago and since then Asus has updated the chassis to yet another visually striking iteration. Its equipped with a stealth fighter exterior and a elegant interior. Keyboard is still the Asus classic chicklet single color backlight (white) completely wrapped in brushed alluminum with probably the best responsiveness I've ever seen on the keys. Its loaded with standard USB, Audio, HDMI ports & Blu-ray equipped. The screen is 17.3 matte anti glare and its color performance is great, the only screen to out perform it was Alienware's (Dell still prices these things stupidly high though). But now to the meat and potatoes of this sexy beast. It runs on Windows 8, and I'll tell you after 10 minutes of using windows 8 I'm like what is everyone crying about? Windows 8 is great! Navigation to any part of my PC by simply hovering over a corner or bypassing having to use a desktop all together by pinning my most used apps to the home page is awesome. Plus its fast, I mean really fast and optimal for SSD's which this laptop has. Speaking of which I see people complaining about the 2x 128gb partitioning of the drives. But I love this as It allows me to have Windows only perform backup operation on the 128gb drive which runs windows and the other ssd drive houses my Steam programs which are backed up on a cloud. This maximizes my HDD space usage and I love that. Performance wise this beast, as I keep referring to it for good reason, destroys every expectation I had when I bought it. I've played all the following titles on Highest Settings (aax4 where available) and not a frame hiccup (+30fps all times) due to the 880m with GPU Tweak Overclocking. Battle Field 4 (gorgeous), Call of Duty Ghosts (wow), Mass Effect Trilogy (didn't know what I was missing), Hitman Absolution (sexy), Metro Last Light (omg, wtf, BBQ), Crysis Trilogy (thank god for NVidia), Tomb Raider (yummy), Far Cry 3 (a game can do that?!) and the list could go on and on. I mean its like playing games for the first time all over again, love it. Now, your going to need a power outlet no doubt about it cause battery technology has yet to evolve to a level that can keep up with mobile power requirements. But unless your lost in the woods every place I have been to has always had available power. Speaking of travel this thing is durable, feels very solid and weighs about 9lbs. It fits comfortably in my Asus bag from my last laptop which was a little bulkier. Heat is not an issue...I almost forgot I was using a laptop as it is super silent even when gaming long periods in AAA titles. It really felt like having a screen and keyboard sitting there and all the parts where in some other room. Ok, so that's pretty much the dirty on this sexy beast so I highly recommend it and as a side note Amazon delivered as promised (as always).", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "To quote MCDONALD'S I'm lovin' it!", "Author": "technojunkie", "ReviewID": "R34SBOTKY2FDL2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "OK I had one of the G75s with the geforce 660m gpu and 16gb ram. This was my \"upgrade\" I am very pleased with the build quality and the slight changes to the design including the metallic keyboard area. The unit is very, very fast. I'm running Tomb Raider on ultra at 60fps. I can finally max out my older games too like Arkham city, which looks fantastic! I don't like that they partition both the ssd and HDD drives. First thing I did was launch the windows partition tool and delete the volumes with no data and extend the rest of the drives so that I just had the C and the D. Just don't delete the 24gb recovery partition, at least I wouldnt. There is minimal bloatware, which is nice. Keyboard is fantastic as is the trackpad. It's easy to disable windows 8 motions like swiping from the right to reveal the charms bar (which you can easily do accidentally). Be forewarned those of you coming from windows 7 that some games may not work right until you figure out the fixes (I'm looking at you Windows live gaming) but that's not an Asus problem. I highly recommend \"start is back\" as a start menu replacement if you want a more traditional windows experience, but 8 isn't so bad when you figure it out. If you use the Steam Big Picture view you may see annoying flickering, but you can go into the nvidia settings and force the notebook to use the on board gpu instead of the geforce 880m that gets rid of the flickering. As I mentioned the games look and play great! I'm very happy with the system so far and believe it to be a great value given that it plays games that look better than my PS4. I'll be happy to answer any questions I can.Update: i've had it for about a week now and still love it, no problems. trackpad is awesome, keyboard still great. Honestly I think you probably would only get a faster machine if its custom built with a dual GPU setup which would be VERY expensive and big and hot. Is it worth the money to trade up from a 780 series geforce? probably not, but if you're coming from an older machine like I did then this may just be the ticket. In my opinion it's a 2500 dollar notebook that actually gives you 2500 dollars worth of notebook. If you travel a lot like I do, and spend a lot of time in airports like I do, and like games, it will be your new best friend. Just find somewhere to plug in.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Excellent gaming rig - complete rundown", "Author": "Ian Cumings", "ReviewID": "R17GWKA76EB08D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Screen:  Very nice matted surface.  Really cuts back on glare and reflections making it easy to concentrate on the game at hand.  Has very nice colors and the high resolution is great.  I also love that it is 17.3\".  When I have the thing on my lap it looks like a 40\" TV would at 10' away.Speakers:  Above average sound but not amazing.  The speaker placement is good (on the top so no muffling) with a subwoofer on the bottom for your bass.  I usually use headphones but when I don't the sound is good and can get pretty loud if desired.Keyboard:  Has 3 backlight settings (differing brightness) but only one color available (white).  Doesn't bother me, it does the job.  The keys are responsive and very well spaced out for a laptop.  The only problem I have is that the front edge of the laptop has a square edge on it so my wrist gets hurt when I rest them there.  It would have been more comfortable with a rounded edge.  A minor inconvenience as I can fix that by putting some fabric there or playing from a different angle.Touchpad:  Your typical touchpad.  It has two buttons for left and right click but also has the multi-finger touchpad commands (2 fingers for scrolling, one finger tap for left click, etc.).  I don't use it much unless I'm surfing the web.  I use a mouse with it most of the time.Cooling:  I'm very pleased with the cooling system on this thing.  It has two fans the blow out the back of the computer so it doesn't hit any of your peripherals or your body when it exhausts.  There is a third fan on the bottom of the laptop so you need to keep the computer on a level surface when using it to insure that fan is working properly.  Try to play on a table top or use a solid surface on your lap for it to rest on to insure max coolness.  I've never had a single problem with the computer getting even semi-hot.Peripherals/Supports:  What you would expect plus some gaming extras.  The disc drive is a Blu-Ray reader, cd, cdrw reader/burner.  There are plenty of USB 3.0 ports plus one designed specifically for charging electronic devices at the same speed as a wall outlet would.  HDMI, VGA, etc. all available.  Headphones, microSD jacks work fine.  Webcam works well.  No complaints.Design/Look/Feel:  It's heavy (almost 10 lbs.) and bulky making it hard to call extremely mobile but that won't be a problem for most gamers since the extra size/weight is what makes the machine possible.  It looks very sleek, starts out thin at the front end and gets bigger towards the back.  Probably about 1.75\" thick at the back.  There are four rubber feet on the bottom that give grip and room for the bottom fan to operate.  The screen's base is about an inch in from the back which makes the laptop seem smaller than it is when opened.  Not a bad thing, keeps the screen closer to your face.  The only problems I have are the square front edge which can hurt your wrist and the LEDs on the front lip of the laptop which can blind you if you are relaxing watching YouTube or a blu-ray in the dark.  I've had to put sticky notes over them since I don't know how to turn them off.Power:  The supply brick is large but thin and the cord is a good length.  Battery life lasts depending on what you are doing.  A few hours for games on ultra settings.  An hour or two more for Blu-rays.  What you would expect from a gaming laptop.Gaming Ability:  Can run most anything on the market right now at top settings.  The only thing it chugs a bit with is World of Tanks but even that gets good FPS at High settings.  Even while gaming the laptop stays relatively cool.  No complaints from me.Bloatware:  Comes with Windows 8 (updated), McAfee, Nvidia control panel, Asus overclocking/power/webstorage software but nothing more than that.HDD/SSD:  Comes with 250gb SSD partitioned in two (128gb for OS operations, 128gb for whatever you want).  Also has 1tb of HDD space at 7200rpm partitioned in two again for whatever you want.Guts/Specs:  You've seen the specs.  Intel i7 4700HQ, Nvidia GTX 880M, 24 GB RAM.  Those specs should be current for a while.WLAN:  Has a Killer WLAN.  Good, fast, you can read up on this separately.ASUS customer support/warranty:  I can't speak to either as I haven't dealt with them and I hope I never have to.  If I do I'll update this review to share my experience.Overall:  A great rig, I'm happy with my purchase.  Only a couple of small design imperfections that annoy me.  I recommend this for anyone looking for a highly capable gaming rig on the go.", "Date": "April 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "For the money, the build quality is disappointing.", "Author": "Marcin Jaskowiak", "ReviewID": "R8JBXUTV6CILR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I received my G750JZ on April 24th, and since then I've been very disappointed with this laptop.The first problem I ran into was the mouse right click, the button was getting stuck against the casing when it was depressed. After using it for a while it started to work smoother.The 2nd issue is the port that the charger connects into is not a snug fit, and the charger wiggles around when plugged in. It seems that it's just a matter of time until there is a connection issue and the laptop will not charge at all.The 3rd issue I have with the laptop is the rubber coating on the exterior of the screen is peeled off on one corner and looks like it will continue to peel as time goes on.Finally I have an issue with the screen on the laptop flickering occasionally. I cannot replicate the problem, it just happens randomly and I've noticed, that it happens when graphics are run through the Nvidia graphics card instead of the onboard video card. Also when the screen is closed on the laptop, it doesn't stay snugly closed and has a bit of looseness to it, and it flaps a when carried around.For a laptop that costs over $2200, I am extremely disappointed. This is the most expensive laptop I have purchased, and the build quality is not up to par for similar priced machines that I was looking at.At this point, I would definitely not recommend this laptop to potential buyers, I read some negative reviews about hardware failures before I made my purchase but figured that Asus has a good reputation and I wouldn't have any issues.Unfortunately that has not been the case.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "So Far SO Good.", "Author": "Joshua Zimmerman", "ReviewID": "R3I5PF1N0EFN84", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros:Multiple Charging USB PortsBlu-ray ReadableGTX 880M (4GB)Good Cooling SchemeSharp ScreenFew HasslesAn Xbox 360 Windows Game Controller and an HDMI cable nets you a very good console like experience.Great KeyboardLighter than you would expect (A little over 10lbs is really nothing)Plays games on High to Ultra settings128GB x2 SSD and a 1 TB HD in RAID 024GB of RAMPlays many demanding games at either high or ultra settings.Rubberized Chassis (good build quality)More bang for your buck.Comes with Windows 8.1Killer Networking CardGPU Tweak OCBenchmarks reveal that the G750  holds its own and then some against the 8GB 880m MSI Dominator Pro.Accidental damage for one year.Cons:I am utterly confused about the difference between the GTX 880M (4GB)  and the (8GB) version.Issues with on board GPU and GTX 880M especially with Steam's Big Picture modeFinger print magnetPCs have a huge learning curve for people that are just getting their first gaming system. (Generally not the computer but the OS's fault.).Some tweaking issues.Decent sound, not great.So far so good,  the system has given me no buyers remorse. I've had huge gaming rigs and my ROG seems to be more enjoyable to handle and it's portable. I know that batery life is important to a lot of people on the go but that's easily remedied by finding a charging source.Overheating is easily a computer killer and the G750JZ-DB71 is quiet as a mouse. The exhaust disperses out of vents in the back and the rest of the laptop stays remarkably cool.If one buys the Microsoft 360 Controller and pairs the controller and an HDMI Cable with the ROG G750JZ-DS71. This creates a console killer. Combine the DS71 with a Roku and one gets a first rate multimedia unit too.Benchmarks compare favorably to the MSI Dominator Pro even though the G750JZ-DS71 has a 4GB variant in the ROG and there's an 8GB 880m in the MSI. I can't seem to grasp the difference between the two variants but I've had zero issues. Games like Farcry 3, Skyrim and the Witcher 2 run without a bump on Ultra settings.One huge complaint about the G750JZ-DS71 would be that Steam's Big Picture flickers uncontrollably and its impossible to tolerate. It's an issue with most laptops because of Steam's compatibility with the 880m and Intel's HD Integrated GPU.The sound is OK. Though I would recommend a good pair of Bose Bluetooth speakers or a nice pair of ear phones.The build quality is fantastic and sturdy. My old Clevo was shotty compared to my ROG. Though the chassis collects more fingerprints than a detective at a murder scene. However, this is a very minor complaint.The 1 TB HD in conjunction with two128GB SSDs cut loading times to a short and insignificant intermission and the OS starts in a flash.For those that complain about the unit's portability, I recommend the Everki Titan Backpack. The G750JZ-DS71 fits snuggly into its check point friendly sheath and it evenly distributes the weight of a huge gaming laptop with ease.  I never get tired hauling my ROG around while travelling.I plan to keep my laptop for about 3 to 4 years before upgrading. I'm pleased to announce that the G750JZ-DS71 has given me nothing but joy since I got it..", "Date": "May 12, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sheer power", "Author": "John Livingston", "ReviewID": "R290LQKSMHPPWA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a PC gamer and I had a 6-7 year old machine. I wanted the ability to play any current game flawlessly, and I cared more about power than trying to buy on the cheap, so I ended up with the Asus G750JZ. I'm extremely happy. Two SSDs in a Raid 0 striped format, one spinning hard drive, tons of memory, blazing processor, beautiful screen, surprisingly good keyboard and great overall looks.My only negative feedbacks are the fact that the spinning hard drive was not locked down, due to missing screws, so when I turned it on for the first time there was no spinning drive detected. Since there were no screws it had completely slid out of the SATA socket and was loose inside the computer. However I loosened one screw, popped off the access panel, plugged it back in and used some screws I had laying around, and I was good to go.I also wish I had a physical restore disk provided for me. There is a recovery partition, but that takes up hard drive space, plus if the drive is ever fully corrupted it could corrupt the restore partition as well. Speaking of partitions, both the Raid 0 SSDs and the spinning drive were partitioned to drives half their size instead of being one large drive.Overall I'm pretty happy, and Amazon responded quickly with one question I had, plus Asus' customer support was quick when I had a question for them. This is the first computer I've bought from a company (I usually build desktops on my own) since the year 2000 when I owned a less-than-stellar Gateway.

I received the first one and 20 minutes later I was on tech support to try to figure out what was wrong with it.  All lights displayed but nothing on the screen.  Hooked it up to my TV via HDMI and there was the windows 8.1 setup.  So ok, dud screen.  Did a replacement item return and Amazon ships me another but I have to ship the broken one back to the tune of 58.42 because Amazon requires insurance and tracking.The second one arrives.  This time nothing on the screen and no HD light or keyboard lights.  Rut-ro raggy.  Tried hooking it up to the TV and this time nothing, totally dead.  This time I just opted for a refund but I am still going to have to pay another 58.42 to return the item.  So now I am out 120.00 bucks and still no laptop to show for it.Not really sure who to point the finger at here.  The shipping packaging had little to no cushion and the laptop box itself only contained corrugated cardboard holding either end.  No foam, no packing peanuts no nothing.

V, FFXIV, etc.) The screen is beautiful and looks nicer than most laptops that I have seen. Keyboard scared me at first since it wasn't like the G73 I own, but the new keyboard feels nice when typing with smooth keystrokes and good key positions. The smart touch pad helps a lot with windows 8 since this version of windows, I feel, was created with touch screens in mind. The smart touch pad has many commands programmed in that help with navigating the system. (Recommend reading the hotkey and smart touch part of the manual. Makes windows 8 tolerable) The battery surprisingly lasts a long time. I forgot to plug in my laptop while playing Star Wars the Old Republic and over an hour later I still had about 20%, was also running on Ultra Graphics and High Performance battery setting. For gaming laptops this caught me by surprise. Most gaming laptops I have seen (Friends) usually last an hour on Good graphics and a decent battery setting. The cost of the system, from what I found, is a lot cheaper than the same spec systems from other brands.Dislikes: The dislikes I have about the laptop are more of a personal taste. The two hard drives of the system are split in two, giving the computer 4 different drives, I wasn't given a choice in the matter which is what bothers me. The keyboard from what I can tell is not removable like older models, I am afraid that what happened to my G73 keyboard (the actual input for several keys failed so I needed to replace the keyboard), and will have to replace the entire computer! Comes with windows 8. After turning on the laptop to test it out it took me 10 min to find the shutdown button (after searching online). Windows 8 takes way to much into being a mobile or tablet OS focus rather than your traditional desktop or laptop OS. It is very app oriented and for a gaming laptop it gets in the way. Huge, I love the size, but finding a backpack for it was hard.Summary: Windows 8 not gamer friendly, Hard drive split too much, individual key keyboard. Great battery life, beautiful screen, smart touch pad, good bang for your buck, and most important for gamers, great performance.I would recommend this laptop to gamers who are on the move and have a strong back and pair of legs. I commute to work 6 days a week and carrying this thing around is a bit rough, but it runs AutoCAD better than the company computers and I don't need to buy an external monitor like all the other employees in the office because their screens are too small.

I'm a fan of Asus, and hope this was just one of those 1 in 100 incidents that happens.Some other things, since I had the chance to look at this thing a bit:- I have a G74S, which I still love to this day.  It still runs perfectly, and plays all the games I have very well (Civ 5, Crusader Kings 2, EU IV, Rome II kinda), so it was hard for me to pull the trigger on this G750.  However, as soon as I seen the G750 up close, I started falling out of love with the G74 and couldn't wait to get my hands on the G750!  Even though design is similar, the newer model looks and feels \"newer and better\".- Not a huge fan of Windows 8 yet, but not the worse thing in the world (remember Windows ME?  Ughh).- I'm also not sold on the SSD being MSATA (I wished this was specified in the specs!). I was under the impression this came with 2 SATA drives, a 256GB SSD and a 1TB 7200 HDD, however this is not the case.- Memory replacement looks like it will be a pain, as only 2 sticks are accessible via the upgrade slot, so you'll have to remove the entire back of the laptop (not sure about voiding warranty) in order to get to the other memory slots.- Even though I didn't get a chance to really take this thing out for a test drive, I'm positive it's as fast and powerful as everybody else says it is. The specs on this thing is insane, so how could it not deliver the goods. I also read many reviews with benchmarks, and the G750 either outperformed or was very close in power to the more expensive Alienware competitor.Just my thoughts.
