I am not normally an adventurer, but I urgently needed a new computer, and had waited until Windows 8 came out so that I could have long use. I was moving from an older Windows Vista, so those with Windows 7 won't be as impressed - although it is hard to separate the experience of Windows 8 from the Lenovo, since they are designed to interact.Touch ScreenThe touch screen is amazingly responsive, it responds as easily as my iPad to my touch. On the other hand, the accelerometer is a bit finicky, and getting the picture to turn is not as responsive. Still, since 99% of my usage is in display or laptop mode, it hasn't been a significant issue. I hope that it is improved in later models.Twist and TurnI LOVE this configuration. I primarily use the display and laptop mode. Even with my iPad, I hated TeePee (an inverted V), and I preferred to be able to set my display up to watch and use it. Times I use this in tablet mode are working on games with my Granddaughter, playing solitaire, or it can be easier to use in this mode while sitting in a seat in a car. I use the laptop mode for work, and the display mode for playing games (so nice to have the screen handy and at just the right angle), watching Netflix or Amazon Video. The sound controls are extra easy to use and the \"windows button\" is quickly handy in display mode.Special notes on Twist and turn, it is particularly handy to watch something with someone seated next to you, and the display mode is especially nice to watch videos on a plane, if that is something you do. I often  will turn my screen to show my husband or daughter something on my computer. It is a really nice feature for families.SpeedMy average sleep to start mode is about 8 seconds. If I am running on battery instead of \"leashed\" it takes a couple of seconds longer to wake up. I have not had any lag in performance of anything I am using, and my only internet lag is when I am at the end of my router range.Touchpad and pointerThis was my first experience with pointers, and I have pretty much ignored mine. It has the red pointer and the two pointer buttons at the top of the touchpad. The touchpad itself is very responsive and uses all of the usual gestures. It sets into the case and clicks on either side to mimic the mouse buttons. The pointer buttons may also be used at the top. Since I have carpal tunnel, I use a trackball, so after testing mine, I converted over.USB portsBoth ports are 3.0. They are placed one on each side of the computer. The 3.0 was very handy when I was transferring information since it helped me to move the information quickly to this computer - essential, since my other computer died only days after I purchased this one. I use a Seagate external drive to back up that has 3.0 USB, so it works well.At the same time, having the configuration of 2 USB on opposite sides was a bit of an issue when running my external DVD player, since it has the option of plugging into two USB ports for power - and the cord was configured for them both to be on the same side.Interaction with Windows 8I took time before it was released to learn a bit about Windows 8, which is why I decided I would like to have a touchscreen to use with it. I love how the touchscreen interacts with Windows 8, and how it quickly becomes intuitive to determine which works  better, a mouse or keyboard move or just reaching out and touching the screen. My only complaint involves my fingerprints on the screen.Another tiny issue I encountered, is that I decided to install Adobe PDF Reader since I didn't really like the Windows Version as much. Adobe has a new reader just for touchscreen that defaults to touchscreen, with no bars on the side. I have to unclick the touch mode in order to use it the way I normally do.  It is nice to have software that knows and installs for touchscreens. I suspect more are on the way.BatteryAs you are aware, battery is based on usage. I find that I average around 5 hours running on battery before I get at 10 percent warning. This is mostly doing some internet research and creating word documents, but also includes some playing of simple word or card games. For comparison, I normally average 5 hours on my iPad. I know the battery says seven hours, but I always take that number with a huge grain of salt and divide it in half for a working number. So five, for my use, is a very nice feature. My complaint here, and with ultra books in general is that you can't carry a spare battery to pop in.Reasons I wanted this modelI wanted a 500G memory, touchscreen, in a reasonable price range. When this was introduced, a local store opened with it on sale, making this particular model particularly desirable.  It had the memory, speed, and flexibility that I desired, and it provided some cool configurations that made it particularly nice for someone already used to an iPad looking for a fully functional computer. I like the fact that in tablet mode, I am not worrying about damaging the keyboard.  I love the weight - a little more than my iPad - actually the weight of 2 iPads, very nice for travelling.I don't use mine to stream to TV or count on it for Blu-ray movies. It is a computer, and the screen is all that I personally need.There are two things to consider when considering this.Your use determines the laptop you use.  If you already use a touchpad, you will enjoy this more than if you are a straight laptop user. If you want fancy screens for movies and such, you might want to look at it in a store before you decide. If you read books on your computer, display mode is perfect, and it sets nicely on your lap. Make sure that you find one that meets YOUR needs. Just because I love mine, doesn't mean you will.Price is a consideration. There are others that are cheaper. There are others that are more expensive. All have their positives and negative points. Even more, I have seen this model on sale in several locations, so I strongly suggest you look around before buying.Good luck with your choices. I love mine and hope you can find one that is perfect for you.EDITED - SOFTWARE UPDATEA software update on December 6 corrected the issue with finicky nature of the screen turning. If you purchase this or are experiencing problems with the screen turning correctly be sure to get the update.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Beautiful IPS touch screen, excellent keyboard; a fantastic portable laptop. (And suggestions for fine tuning it.)", "Author": "targetcustomer", "ReviewID": "R1BNTQV7FLW0K6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I own several laptops (HP, Dell, Toshiba) and for my son's college laptop, I've looked at all competing laptops (HP, Samsung, Intel, Toshiba, Sony, etc.) and compared them multiple times at the store before deciding on the Twist. Once I have fine tuned the screen adjustments and some other minor functions (see below), and turned off the bloatware programs, it has functioned flawlessly. I could not be happier - this is a great portable laptop with a VERY, VERY, VERY, PRETTY SCREEN.At $700-800, there is *absolutely* nothing like it on the market at this price point: thin ultrabook, IPS touchscreen (don't get Win 8 without touchscreen), 3rd gen. i5, good sized combo HDD/SSD, keyboard with deep travel. Read on for details below.The laptop is fairly thin at 0.78 inch and at 3.5 lbs is a reasonable compromise for size and weight for a college laptop. It has magnesium construction and nice gorilla glass, and all the exposed metal surfaces feel warm & smooth, almost like a rubberized finish. It is sleek and modern looking, and feels very nice to the touch (Sony S for example has cold and cheap feeling metal surfaces). I should add that besides functionality and computing power, I place emphasis on 2 parameters that not everyone may pay attention to: the feel and feedback of the keyboard, for my son the college student - go Sagehens, and the quality of the display, as we both are avid photographers (he's more artistic but I am more \"nutty\" :-)).Battery life for current Intel i5 laptops with non Solid State disk drive and touchscreen (consume more energy) tend to be around 4-5 hours, and this laptop in that aspect is par for the course. Sorry it's not 7 hours and it's not going to be like a tablet. Since I don't want to forego the touchscreen feature and want to keep cost low (HDD as opposed to SSD), I accepted this.Resolution: I actually prefer resolution of 1366x768 for these smaller screens; 1600 would make text and everything too small for these smaller screens. (You could increase text size through display settings but that's not ideal - pictures on web sites become blur, etc.)3 primary reasons that I picked this laptop, besides the reasonable cost:1. The excellent IPS TOUCH SCREEN WITH FANTASTIC picture quality/saturation/contrast/viewing angle. This is one of very few ultrabooks, and by far the least expensive, with an IPS panel (google \"IPS screen\" to find out). If you are into photography, you *will* love this screen; it puts 99% of other laptops' screens to shame, particularly those HP and Sony ultrabooks with their very washed-out screens. Note that it's not just the pictures that pop, text on the Lenovo IPS screen is smoother and seems easier to read as well. Comparing to a Sony S series that I have next to it, the difference is remarkable.Lastly, don't buy any Windows 8 machine without a touchscreen, it does change how you interact with the computer.2. BEST KEYBOARD BY FAR of all ultrabooks. Thin laptop computers tend to have lousy keyboard with very little depth travel (HP, Sony, etc.). Lenovo Twist has outstanding Thinkpad-class keyboard, with great tactile feedback and deeper travel than all ultrabook class laptops that I have tried.3. Why I picked Lenovo Twist over the also excellent Lenovo Yoga: First, the considerable cost difference between the 2. Second, keyboard doesn't get exposed when in tablet mode like Yoga. Regarding the keyboard, for me, the Twist's keyboard has better layout and is better than that of the Yoga when it comes to the feel/feedback/travel of the keys. Yoga's right shift and back space keys are **half-sized** and that bothers me. Third, the Yoga with 128 gb SSD has very little HD space left for anything, and the one with 256 is way too expensive at this point. Lastly, the Twist is smaller and more portable and hence better for my son's intended use in college (YMMV). To me, size wise the Twist strikes a perfect balance for a hybrid laptop-tablet combination; not too big as a tablet, not too small as a laptop.HOW TO MAKE LIFE WITH THIS LAPTOP EASY: first thing to do when you get the Twist is to type \"update\" at Metro screen then \"enter\" to let the system update itself; the original software has a few teething problems particularly with the rotation function. Second, thanks to Win 8 there are several duplicate controls for adjustment of power settings, auto dimming, and screen brightness adjustment that drove me absolutely nuts until I had things figured out. For example auto dim brightness is adjusted by at least 2 independent algorithms: one that operates by sensor (auto dim according to ambient light - turned off by \"Change PC Settings\" in Windows 8) and one that operates through the power management - turned off or adjusted by clicking on the battery icon. Similarly, brightness and power management are set by using either \"Graphics Property\" which gives you the Intel Graphics Control Panel, or by clicking on the battery icon to enter power management.Some fine tuning \"tricks\" that have helped me:***Type \"update\" on Metro screen to update to latest Lenovo's software/firmware change. This will update the flawed auto-rotation function that comes loaded from factory.***You must turn off the auto dim function that adjusts to ambient light, or it will likely drive you crazy. On Metro screen, wipe from right side, then \"Settings,\" then \"Change PC Settings\" at right lower corner, then \"General,\" then scroll down to \"Screen,\" then turn off \"Adjust my screen brightness automatically.\"***There is a second auto dim function that's related to power saving, in the Power Options->Change Advanced Power Settings if you want to get rid of that too.***I actually turn off \"auto-rotation\" in Control Panel->Display->Change Display Settings because I don't really have a need for it, however even after having turned this off, when I start twisting the screen auto-rotation does turn on automatically and this feature works fine.***Start Button for those who miss it - google for the \"Lenovo Quick Launch.\"***To silent laptop speakers when you plug in a headphone: Control Panel-->Realtek HD Audio Manager-->Advanced Device Settings-->Click/check Multi-stream mode.***Lenovo Solution Center: Oddly enough, I found that if you scan both discs (Hitachi HDD and Samsung SSD) during the hardware check up part, you'll get a failure grade for the Samsung targeted read test. However if you scan the SSD only, then it passes the test. This is a bug in Lenovo Solution Center and I ignore the error message.***I also turn off all warnings and notifications from the bloatwares that come with this laptop from Lenovo, Intel, etc., so they don't keep popping up annoying messages.***Wipe-from-left-edge-to-flip-through-opened-programs/apps function: I turn this function off because I would accidentally activate it through the touchpad when I type and cause a different program to open.***Press \"Windows key\" and \"x\" at the traditional desktop screen to bring up critical functions like control panel, etc.***If you just start typing (any letter, anything) on Metro screen, you automatically activate search function for all apps and programs. Very convenient.UPDATE 2/5/2013: Continued to function flawlessly; son took it with him to college and loves it. The small size, lighter weight, and sturdy finish are a plus as he takes it to classes.", "Date": "December 31, 2012"}, {"Title": "Exactly what I wanted in a mobile laptop/tablet combo, but ended up returning", "Author": "Steve Crossland", "ReviewID": "R3CP4DAM13MURR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased two of these units for my wife and me from Staples a few days ago. We've both run them through enough of our routine work tasks that I can say I am officially in love. My rating is really a 4.5, but I choose to round up instead of down because, for me, the benefits outweigh the shortcomings.My wife and I are both Realtors with iPhones and we work full time off our two laptops from a home office. We are very mobile, meeting clients mostly in the field, at coffee shops, or at their homes, but do spend a lot of time at a desk, working in \"desktop\" mode. She's been bugging me for over a year to get an iPad. I've resisted because I don't view the iPad as a solution to any of our productivity issues, and I didn't want each of us to have a third device to deal with. Instead, I have been patiently waiting for the right Ultrabook, and the Thinkpad Twist is it.Is it big enough to work on full time?When we downsized from full PCs to fulltime 15.6 Laptops 3+ years ago, I was very worried about adapting to the smaller size keyboards and screens. It worked out just fine, but I have the same concern going from 15.6 inch screens to 12.5 inch screens, especially as we're both in our 50s now and don't see as well.For both of us, the Twist passes the size test, no problem. I can see just fine with the smaller screen. So can my wife. The keyboard is, surprisingly, actually better for me than the bigger laptop keyboard or even a full size desktop keyboard. I basically type with two finger (each hand) plus thumbs. So I'm having no trouble at all. All the keys I normally need and use are located well. I tried out some of the Surface Tablets in the Microsfot store in Austin, and, to me, the keyboard provided on this ultrabook is so much better than the keyboards available with the Surface that I wouldn't even consider trying to work full time on anything less.How is the Touchpad and Button setup?In my normal work desk area, I use a mouse, so no issues there. I plugged in the small usb plug and it set itself up in a few seconds and the wireless mouse was working, just like that. Easy. (As an aside, i've had no connectivity issues with my wireless printer, WiFi, Home network, Public WiFi either. Everything has connected seamlessly with no problem at all)However, as I type this in my favorite coffee shop, without a mouse, I'm still adapting to the touchpad and, specifically, the darned gestures that Windows 8 thinks I'm making, which constantly changes the screen to another app. I had no idea that I lightly graze the touchpad with my thumbs so often when typing, but I do, and I'll have to learn to stop that. Meanwhile, in the settings, I've told Windows to not change screens with \"swipe from left\". Instead, it now pops up a small left-side column of recently used apps, which is still annoying but not disruptive. I simply swipe from left again to close it, then carry on.The other bit of training I'm having to learn is the actual speed of motion when moving the mouse. Sometimes, when just moving the mouse left, it thinks it's a swipe because I moved too fast. I feel that I will continue to learn and adapt to the sensitivities of the machine and Windows 8.The other non-mouse issue is the buttons and clicking. I haven't used the red pointer at all, other than out of curiosity. Nor the pointer buttons at the top of the pad. Both the bottom left and right of the touchpad itself depress and act as \"right click\" and \"left click\". I find it easy enough to do this because this is where the buttons were located on my old laptop anyway. It's also easy enough to click and drag when dragging and dropping files from one folder to another, or when dragging windows to one side or the other to set up split screen view of two different windows.Finally, my wife hasn't experienced one single instance of the \"accidental swipes\" changing her screen. She's oblivious to what I'm even talking about when I ask her. She uses all fingers to type and her thumbs don't flop around the touchpad like mine, and I guess she uses kinder, gentler movements of the mouse. So, this issue will vary from user to use I feel.Does it get too Hot?I read some reviews complaining about the heat so I'll address that quickly. Running side by side next to my old Dell Studio 15 laptop, the two systems produce exactly the same amount of heat. I don't think the ThinkPad produces too much heat, and I wouldn't have thought to even mention it had I not read about it in so many other reviews. In tablet mode, yes, I can feel that it's hotter in one area in back than the other, but no more so than my daughter's iPad that her school provides, which I held for comparison. To me, this isn't an issue.How is it in Tablet Mode?I spent a couple of hours yesterday in tablet mode. This is actually my first Tablet, so I have nothing to compare it to (oter than iPhone). And I spend more time producing than consuming content on my computer, but I really enjoyed reading news, swiping through articles, etc. I don't play games so I didn't try any of those and can't comment about that.The system was responsive and quick. The screen easy to read (though it randomly dims temporarily every now and then), and I found it easy to learn the gestures and movements needed to navigate through apps and content. It was especially wonderful watching sports news videos. I tried an app where I could draw with my finger. Not my thing, but it seemed to work just fine for those who want to create/draw or annotate photos or documents in that manner.The real tablet-mode test will come later as my wife wants to replace paper printouts with pdf files of sales listings when showing properties. Many Realtors do this with iPads, and I imagine this will be accomplished on the Twist in tablet mode with a pdf app of some kind.How is the portablility?This is one of the things we will enjoy most. This computer is very small and thin. My wife can actually slip it into one of her larger purses instead of lugging the bigger, heavier laptops we had. We will be travelling for 5 days next week and will put them through the real life travel test then, but already I can tell this is going to be a very easy unit to carry around and work with, especially having WiFi hotspots built into our phones.Do Legacy Windows Programs Run OK?This is more of a W8 questions, but I do have two legacy desktop software applications that I need to run, which is another reason I ruled out an RT tablet, and they both run fine in desktop mode.Did you look at the Lenovo Yoga?Yes, but ruled it out because the hard drive is too small (way smaller usable hard drive space than the specs suggest) and the keys are exposed at bottom in laptop mode (though disabled). Also, the Twist can assume all 4 positions of the Yoga, so I personally saw a destinct advantage with the Twist. Finally, I wanted a business-oriented build and design, and the Thinkpad is built for business (though I think a home user might also find it a better entertainment machine as well).Overall, three days in, I'm very pleased. More importantly, my non-techie wife is very happy with hers as well. I'm especially pleased about having been patient and waited so long for the right combination of form factor and utility. This unit really hits the right note for me as a mobile professional. I never bought into the \"tablet only\" solution. Twist offers both a full fledge windows machine with real keyboard, and a useful tablet for uses better suited to a tablet factor. It has real posrts and connectivity to other hardware. It hits a real sweet spot for me. It's not \"too small\" as a 12.5\" laptop, and not \"too big\" as a 12.5\" tablet. Perfect!If I left anything out (which I'm sure I did), feel free to ask.EDIT: I've reduced my Review star score to 3 stars.After writing the initial review, different problems started showing up. For my wife, the best description would be \"Bloatware Gremlins\", constantly pestering and prompting her to click this, install that. She kept getting popups for all different things. I have no idea what she did but her IE started freezing up regularly and she started having intermittent issues. On our business trip, she ended up not able to use the computer, but used mine.For me, I guess I'm not as susceptible to the Bloatware Gremlins, and swat them away without thinking much about it, but I did eventually find the \"dripping\" out of these prompts and popups to be annoying. Also, my Lenovo Service Window box would remain open constantly and I couldn't get it to close. When I closed it, it would open right back up. I called support and they couldn't find the record of my warranty or registration, even though I could type it in at their website and it confirmed as being a registered computer under warranty. The trouble ticked was \"escalated\", yet I never heard back from anyone, and still haven't to this day.Finally, I was experiencing intermittent flickering of the screen in tablet mode. I'd have to turn off the unit and restart to get it to stop. And the screen would not rotate properly from landscape/portrait mode at times. Also, direct sunlight on the screen seemed to cause problems.I could probably have worked through the issues on mine eventually, but my wife and I always use identical computers in our business/usability, and she was unwilling to keep trying to deal with her unit. With the 14 day return window almost up, I decided to take them back. The lady at Staples said someone else had returned theirs that day also, with some sort of hard drive issue.", "Date": "November 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "5 stars!", "Author": "Danny K", "ReviewID": "R1SU14JFQAMN1Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned many laptops and netbooks. I started with the 15\" models some years ago but found out they were too heavy to take on my commute to work. So I went to the netbooks and after different models I found out they were too small. My last netbook was a Acer 11.5\" aspire. Great netbook but again after time the screen was too small to do excel sheets etc. Went to my local best buy store to check out the Lenovo yoga 13 but found the screen flimsy. Read the reviews on the twist and when Staples came out with a $699 model I jumped on it. I have had mine for a week now and here are my points:PROS:1. Great build (thin and sturdy)2. Best keyboard available3. Love the stick mouse (I disabled the mouse pad)4. Windows 8 is very stable (love it)5. Touch Screen works very well.6. Battery has improved (see updates)CONS:1. None for me!I do really enjoy having the larger screen (12.5\") compared to my old netbook. Windows 8 is like having two operating systems. (a touch screen system and a windows keyboard system (like windows 7). Just press the winkey +D and you are into windows 7. Use Classic shell for your start button and  you can copy all the items you used when you did have a start button to the bottom task bar or the classic shell start menu (see updates) Then press the winkey and you are at the start screen and with your mouse you can set the icons you wish to use.  Still learning windows 8 but so far I find it very very stable. So far I have found no issues with windows 8.UPDATE 2-14-2013I wanted to share this in case someone else has the same problem. Used the lenovo thinkpad on my way to work on the train and while watchinig movies or playing music, I noticed the screen was freezing, audio glitching. Very annoying! I called Lenovo support and they showed me that the laptop has active hard drive protection. And basically if it detects movement it will shut the hard drive down and then allow it to operate again if the vibration goes away. This is an easy adjustment (go to setting and in search type active protection\" Works great now! it was set to high so it picked up all the movement on the train!UPDATE: 2-21-2013OMG, this computer grows on you! Windows 8 is stable, fun and fantastic. The wireless adapter is the best I have had on a laptop top. The battery is 3-4 hours but I found this was not a problem for me. Best laptop I have had to date and believe me I have had many! I changed my starts from 4 to 5!UPDATE 3-25-13Found that when my headphones were plugged in the sound still came out of the speakers!? Here is the fix:, go to control panel, then click on Realtek HD audo manager, click on the top right advance settings and select muli stream mode. Now the sound will switch from speakers to the headphones. Also really missed the start button while on desktop. I installed classic shell. It is a free program and is fantastic. It gives you the start button with plenty of settings!!!! I now have classic shell set so if I press the winkey it will automatically switch between the desktop and the windows 8 start screen. Very cool!UPDATE 4-2-13Found that the wireless adapter connects faster to my wifi if I remove the bluetooth icon from my startup folder and drag it into my classic shell icons for easy starting when needed. Now my wireless wi-fi connects instantly. Also found the intergrated camera wasn't working,(showed grey screen with a circle and a line through it) I had to google the fix, clicked into lenovo setting and went to camera and found it set on private mode!? Put it to normal and it works fine! Also went on a skiing trip to Canada BC. Its a 5+ hour plane ride and the screen on my seat was dead so I used the Lenovo thinkpad and it lasted the entire trip (watching videos and playing windows games with my granddaughter) I was so impressed I removed the battery life from my cons list!

Most ultrabooks are exposed metal which can feel cold. Especially if you bring your laptop to bed. Twisting the screen and laying flat may be a gimmick to some, but turning the screen around and watching movies or touch games in bed, is perfect.

Thinkpad Twist won out even though the Yoga had some better features like longer battery and full 16:9 widescreen and was a little thinner though the weight was the same at 3.5 lbs.  The Twist has the traditional Thinkpad keyboard with mouse joystick and buttons above the touchpad while the Yoga had a bigger all touch intelligent touchpad but I liked having the actual conventional mouse buttons as I am more comfortable with traditional mice as a longtime user.I also liked the huge 500gb harddrive as I learned the 128gb SSD on the Yoga only had 39gb free on the C drive and 23gb on D drive after Lenovo reserved space and win 8 system and software.  I also just liked the Twist's fold down screen better for lap work or play as a tablet though the Yoga total fold back screen was cool too.  I liked the Twist more for ports too with both hdmi and minidisplay ports so I can connect to any type of monitor, not just one with hdmi.  I also liked it having two USB 3.0 ports over Yogas one 3.0 and one 2.0. I would prefer them both on the same side instead of opposite but hey, they are both hi speed.Sound quality is great and it has dual mics for group discussions like conferencing.  Again, this is why this baby is very useful to people in business as well. The twist exterior skin almost feels rubbery and not smooth like the Yoga (which is beautiful) and is less likely to slip in my hands.  The Twist is really a business oriented ultrabook versus what I think is just a consumer oriented one like the Yoga seems to me.  It has Lenovo Busines Solutions Software which several utilities built in good for business people.  The Twist also has a SIM card port for future connectivity too the Yoga did not have even though the cost was over $200 more.  It has TPM enterprise security built in too.I just love Win 8 and the overall feel and utility the Twist gives me and feel it is the best choice of the new Win 8 hardware released so far.  I think Lenovo did a great job on both models but being an older long time PC and notebook user, I just felt more at home with the Twist and look forward to many hours with it.My only complaint is they state it has up to 7 hours battery, but I have learned that is only possible in power saving mode with dim screen, slower processing speed, and some port turn offs while my actual performance with settings I like are only giving me between 4 to 5 hours of use between charges while the Yoga I know would have given me maybe 2 hours or more battery time.

Light kept changing brightness every few seconds without my doing anything2. Sound didn't work3. Mouse cursor was constantly flickering4. Touch screen didn't work5. It would take forever for the screen orientation to change when computer was rotated6. A program would be exited spontaneously without my doing anything.I sent my computer in for repairs after speaking with a few technical support people.A week later, they returned my computer, with a replaced motherboard.All issues but (3) above were addressed by that replacement.However, after that, I started having another issue: I would get a message, every five minutes, saying that the Windows needs to be activated and that the serial number that was in there was invalid.I started calling Tech Support again, and spoke with a bunch of different representatives, none of whom knew what to do. Eventually, after wasting hours and hours of my time, I demanded to speak with a manager, who suggested that it would be most wise for me to either get a refund for the computer or get a replacement, and promised to escalate my case to the appropriate individuals.In a couple days, I got a phone call from another manager, who repeated what the first manager said, and asked whether I would prefer a refund or a replacement. At that point, I said that a refund would be best, because I had no desire to deal with their customer service anymore. He said that he would forward my case to the top tier manager who would send me all the information that would be required to get the refund processed.The next day, I received a phone call from the top tier manager, Kelly, as promised. She left me a voicemail, the content of which can be summarized as follows: \"I don't understand the issue, you should not be having this issue, and for that reason, we're not going to replace the computer or refund your money\". I received the voicemail a couple hours before catching a plane to go on a business trip abroad for several weeks. After I called her back, she repeated all of this, completely contradicting everything her fellow representatives had told me earlier. I demanded to speak to her manager, to which she said: \"if you want to proceed, you will have to deal with me; otherwise, I will close the case\". The conversation got heated; Kelly was obnoxiously rude and unprofessional, and probably the most inappropriate person to work in Customer Relations Management, which was her department. I had to run catch my plane, so decided that I would call back once I'm back in the country.When I called back, I spoke with a technician who told me that my case had been closed. Thankfully, that technician had been quite helpful and offered me to send back the computer to have it looked at again. It's not quite a refund or a replacement, but I will take what I can get from this horrendous company.I will never buy a Lenovo again neither for personal nor for business use. I can't deal with defective products, technicians who are (despite being friendly) largely unhelpful, and customer relations managers who are beyond unprofessional.

Schmidt", "ReviewID": "RYHESV5TZQQ19", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased my Twist after looking at the Samsung Ativ Smart PC 500T.  Both offer interesting approaches to the tablet/laptop hybrid at similar prices.  I purchased my Lenovo on sale for $848 after tax, while the Samsung is $750 on Amazon.  I decided on the Lenovo because A) it was available locally, and B) I wasn't sure if I wanted to lug around the keyboard dock on the Samsung, and it wasn't useable as a tablet with it attached.  I have used HP elitebooks at work before so I knew how the Lenovo's hinge mechanism worked, and decided that was the better alternative for me.  The Lenovo also offers the advantage in that it has a far more powerful Intel i5 CPU, while the 500T only comes with the Intel Atom Z2760.  Both are dual cores at I believe 1.7GHz, and while I have not had a chance to use a device with this new atom I think it's safe to say the i5 is much more powerful (CPUBenchmark.net gives the i5 3317U a score of 3,211 vs 679 for the Atom Z2760.  A side note, the 500T's big brother, the 700T, comes with the same i5 3317U CPU as the Lenovo Twist.This CPU is a huge advantage as it is pretty powerful for a laptop, but still runs very cool.  I installed core temp and did the WEI benchmark, temps got to the mid 60's Celsius, but it never felt more than warm to touch.  I'd had a Samsung Series 3 laptop with a i3 before, and in comparison that would get scalding hot compared to the Lenovo.  Other components include an acceptable but loud 500GB @ 5400rpm hard drive, 4GB (upgradeable to a single 8GB slot) of DDR3 memory, and a 5 touch point screen that runs at a somewhat disappointing 1366x768 (720p).  Windows 8 experience index is :6.9 for processor5.9 for Memory (RAM)4.4 for graphics (Intel HD4000)6.1 for gaming graphics5.9 for hard driveThe powerful CPU is definitely a plus, but to be honest the screen resolution is a little disappointing.  The 700T offers full 1080p at 1980x1080 resolution.  It'd be nice if the Lenovo at least offered 1600x900 as it is a ThinkPad which indicates its aimed towards business users.  As mentioned before the hard drive is also a little loud, most of the time it isn't noticeable except when its frequently accessing the drive.  A 128gb solid state drive (also used in the Samsung 700T) would be greatly appreciated and I can't imagine would add much cost, though I am sure some would prefer the larger space over speed/lower temps/quietier advantages of the SSD.  In any case it's not too difficult to take out the old HDD and put an SSD in, same goes for upgrading the RAM to 8GB.The final complaint is in the screen, while it is responsive and works and looks nice it seems like it's a little underwhelming.  For example, even the atom powered Samsung 500T offers the 10 point touch screen with wacom digitizer and stylus.  Again, considering this is a business laptop, I think the Lenovo could benefit from this.  Looking at the $300 premium of the 700T, maybe it's not worth the extra price to have an SSD, digitizer, and 1080p screen - but I doubt it'd really cost that much to add this hardware to the Twist.  Afterall, the Samsung 700T is cramming all that PC hardware into the screen as the keyboard area is just an attachable dock, while Lenovo has the whole body to basically work around with.  That said, I'm still happy with the Twist, I guess Lenovo just got me hooked and now I'll be buying the 1080p version with digitizer when it comes out.Edit:  I noticed the IdeaPad Yoga solves most of the complaints I have about this Thinkpad, it has an SSD, higher res screen, not sure about if it's a 10 point or 5 point touch sensitive screen though.  It's also quite a bit more expensive and I'm not sure I like how it converts between a tablet and laptop.  I am surprised that an Ideapad has better hardware than a Thinkpad, a little disappointing.EDIT:  6 months in update.I am finding it a lot harder to recommend this laptop, having a touch screen is nice, but I almost never fold it back and use it as a tablet because of it's bulky size.  I'm probably a bit of a traditionalist but the Metro/Modern UI interface still seems a bit useless to me and is more of a hassle than any kind of benefit.In addition, the fan seems to be getting louder and more annoying, it kicks on and off constantly if doing anything besides simple web browsing, and it's very noticeable when I'm in my apartment or anywhere remotely quiet.  Even with just web browsing it still kicks on enough to be annoying.  I monitor temps and it stays about 45-50 Celsius when not being used much.There are a couple other features which I feel this laptop really should have, and seeing it as almost standard on equivalents is really disappointing.  Intel's WiDi would be great on this as it would allow me to project it onto a TV.  This would be an awesome HTPC replacement.  The battery life is still disappointing.  Unfortunately the alternative is getting an Atom powered convertible/tablet which has horrible performance but twice the battery life.  The screen resolution is pretty poor, at least a 1600x900 would be a huge improvement.  On a thinkpad which is designed for productivity the low resolution really hinders workflow.Since the tablet mode is not really that functional, I'd recommend the Asus Vivobook lineup.  The 11.6inch i3 Vivobook sells for under $500 and offers performance extremely close to the Lenovo Twist.  Unfortunately however, even the 14inch i5 Vivobooks still come with just a 1366x768.  If I bought again I'd have spent the extra money and gotten the Samsung 700T Convertible.  1080p screen, has WiDi, a stylus/digitizer pen, and a better battery.", "Date": "November 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Lenovo 230u has lots of problems; tech support lousy", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1Z4D2BJQH237B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research, and this computer got mostly good reviews.

They sent me a letter telling me I needed to go to certain web sites to reload the drivers.2) The screen then began sticking upside down in auto-rotate mode. I called tech support, and they told me there was a store that could fix it about 45 minutes from my house. I took it there, and they were NOT a certified Lenovo repair center, and refused to touch it for fear of invalidating the warranty.3) I called tech support again, and this person asked me to reload the drivers. It was then that I discovered that the websites in the letter were WRONG, and that I had not reloaded all of the drivers I needed. He assured me that the drivers would solve my problem. They didn't.

Internet Explorer in metro mode couldn't properly display a site that I regularly use (mint.com). Also, when I open a lot of tabs (which I tend to do) after about the 8th tab, it will start automatically closing older tabs without notification.3) When I pin tiles to the new metro start menu, they will disappear after a reboot, going to sleep, or even just going to the desktop. So I'll have to repeatedly add the tiles I use most (like google chrome)4) The battery life is not 7 hrs as advertised, but more like 3-4.

There is a button to lock the screen in its current position but that is very buggy as well. There is no light/on-screen notification to tell you whether or not it has been locked. This button has a mind of its own.

I'm doing this because of the reasonable price (the same price or less than most similarly configured laptops that weigh more, don't have touch screens, and are not convertible), the quality of the product (solid, nice rubbery skin, finger-friendly keyboard sealed to prevent damage from spills, hard drive protected to minimize damage from dropping, 2 USB-3 ports, and more), the fact that it is a full-featured ultrabook AND a high-end responsive tablet, and the 4-mode convertibility.As an aside, it seems to me that the weirdness of Windows 8 - two operating systems existing simultaneously - makes perfect sense (but only makes any sense at all) on a machine like this that is both fully a laptop and fully a tablet. It's my only Windows 8 device and I would definitely NOT upgrade any of my non-touch screen devices to Windows 8.Cons:1. Battery - As many others said, I can't get more than 3 hours of battery life even after spending hours configuring all the options for power-saving and with modest power usage such as checking emails and word processing. The 7 hour claim is an outrage and really false advertising. The auto-power saving mode sets the screen so dim that you can barely see anything. All my work is international and I travel to Europe, Russia, or Africa about once a month. I have to have at least 5 hours of battery life. So I bought an external battery that will allow me to use it when the battery is dead and will recharge the battery at the same time. So essentially I have added another pound to the weight of the machine and a $100 to the cost (frowny face emoticon here). It cost $100 not $195 only because I found a great \"Black Friday\" deal. However, I should be able to get 9 hours out of it now (happy face emoticon here). You can't just carry an extra battery (which cost about $175) because to replace the battery requires taking the machine completely apart and if you do it yourself you will probably void the warranty. I feel pretty confident about these things, but I would take it to a certified repair place to replace the battery.2. No user manual. There is a \"Hardware Maintenance Manual\" available online which has some of the information you need, but not all, and a lot of information you don't need. It's evident that it was not written for the user.3. Can't add RAM...at least not easily. It is not in a slot but soldered to the mother board. As of now, the machine is very speedy and 4 GB is fine. However, if needed in the future after I have loaded on (too) many programs, it would be nice to be able to add RAM without having to do major surgery.4. Technical Support is inadequate. I couldn't get the tablet mode to work because the \"lock screen rotation\" button didn't work. Technical support was no help. They knew almost nothing about this machine and admitted it. The TS person told me that I knew more than he did about this machine. I assumed that it was broken and was ready to take it back when I finally found through a web search that I needed to update the Power Manager to a newer version. Here's the link in case you need it:[...]Now it works. How could they ship out this product with an essential function not working?Love is not just blind, but stupid. I apparently love this machine enough (conditionally, however) so that I am stupidly spending money that I shouldn't spend and time that I don't have to work around or compensate for the problems and to write this review.

Windows 8 is coming along nicely and I have only a few issues with the laptop.1)  The screen goes dark and then bright for no reason.....I solved this problem by going to the Lenovo website and download the fix for the ambient light sensor.  Problem solved.2) No caps lock warning light.  Not a major issue although when you've been typing for a while then look at the screen and it's all capitals it can be very frustrating.Apart from these minor issues I have no complaints about this laptop.  Any new computer will take time to update relevant software like adobe etc.  Will always have the issue of downloading the new drivers for your relevant devices  and trying to keep the new windows OS up to date (always an issue) but I have found this  laptop quite a pleasure to use.  It's small and compact.  The screen swivels easy enough and I find the touch screen very easy to use.  The windows 8 shortcuts have mostly been found through trial and error but when I find something new it's nice and exciting.I have lots of photos and when viewing them the laptop seems seamless unlike my last computer.  I really haven't found anything on this computer that I don't like but it's only been a short time.  FINGERS CROSSED!!!Had this computer a few months now and am now on my second.  I sent my original back as the battery wouldn't charge.  Lenovo customer service were good if not very informative and they eventually sent me a new laptop.

The touchscreen some time loads and other times doesn't and i have to reboot several times.  One day all my Apps work and then next they don't.

In fact, I installed the CP and the final EOM version on a prior ThinkPad (SL410) shortly after in came out. In a nutshell, Win8 is great once you learn how to mouse to the corners. Why Microsoft felt the need to essentially hide its basic features in corner-spotted contextual menus, I don't know; they have way too much faith in the average user. However, Win8 runs fast, is secure, and the Metro interface is pretty great -- especially for apps like Solitaire, MahJohng, ESPN, Netflix, and KEXP. There's some really cool stuff in the store, much of it that doesn't require a touchscreen.That said, a touchscreen (like the one in the Twist) brings the whole experience alive. Windows 8 is the OS of the future, especially when you see how smoothly you can switch between app-heavy Metro and the traditional desktop experience. Again, I think it takes a bit of an advanced user to understand how to make it all work, but once you do, it's pretty slick. Touching your screen to launch tasks, browse files, and so on, seems so natural that you wonder why it took so long. Combine that with a traditional keyboard (like the Twist) and you've really good a good thing going.So, that's a quick overview of Win8. What about the Twist?  Here's a look at the good and bad.The good:* The build quality. The rubberized feel is premium, the screen looks great, the keyboard is amazing, and the whole deal feels nice. It's ThinkPad; you know you're getting quality.* Battery. Others have said it's poor, but I haven't had that experience. Dial down the screen brightness, and you can get a good 4, nearly 5 hours out of this. It's enough for a plane ride; not sure where else you'd go without access to a power cord. Because the screen is so good, you can lower the brightness and still have a good experience.* The hybrid functionality. It's so good! Flipping the screen around and using the Twist as a tablet is a revelation. I use it mostly as a comic book reader, and it's really perfect for that application. (Next step is for Marvel to bring its Marvel Universe app to the Windows Store.) Playing simple games, navigating Metro apps, etc., is really smooth. The weight of the device is such that, for me, it's a pretty good tablet. And when you need to type something long-form, you simply turn the screen around and go at it. It's pretty good.* The weight. Coming from a fivish-pound device, I'm surprised how light this is.Now the not-so-good:* Screen rotation can be iffy. Maybe a driver update can help this out?* Sound is good and loud, but sometimes distorted. Can't tell if this is a source or playback issue. You're not getting premium sound out of this device, to be sure.* The screen is a fingerprint magnet. Nothing that can be done about that, and it's really only noticeable when the screen is off, but there you are.* It'd be nice for a traditional HDMI and more USB ports, but oh well.If you're on the fence, I say go for it. You're not finding a Windows 8 hybrid device anywhere near this price class, and you'll be surprised just how capable this device is. I'm not a gamer, so the 720p and lower specs don't bug me.

Its more powerful than a lot of ultrabooks (get the i5 cpu or higher).People complain about all types of things when it comes to electronics and expect a flawless product for the first of its kind.  That's not the case with anything that's even remotely complex that is brand new and revolutionary.  Yes, there have been tablets that can run windows OSes before but not full fledged versions with this stability.  I didn't have any of the issues ppl have mentioned, I guess there was just a few bugs in some of the Twists Lenovo shipped out.Don't expect to play intense video games on here or to run a home music studio out of this thing.  It can handle some music production programs (i5) but it takes it about three tries; in other words the music program will freeze 2-3 times before it runs fine.  This is not what you want when trying to produce professional sound tracks, video, photos etc.  Know what you are buying (the specs) and what they can do for you.  The CPU is great and from the best chip maker.  The ram, though not upgradeable, is enough to run just about everything.  I would avoid streaming more than 5-6 videos at once but only youtube maniacs do that.The sound is ok, tiny little speakers on a tiny computer.  The touch screen works great, just tilt it a little farther so it changes orientation when you want it to.  The ambient light sensor can be turned off.  I figured this out myself.  After that, the computer works great.  I am even running another Windows system inside of it (Virtual machine).

The touch responsiveness is amazing, similar to iOS responsiveness.The hardware is nice, very solid, light, small, but has everything I need. Touchpad is okay, I hate having the buttons above the touchpad, as opposed to below, which is what I was used to. It does have multitouch on the touchpad after the updates.

I didnt know how I was going to feel, but the responsiveness, all the screen gestures (swiping from any corner has a uniform response) are incredible, switching between the tiles and desktop is completely harmless, and super fast and easy. I LOVE the live tiles, and almost every app I have used has a live tile, giving you information, and just looks cool. Try out all the gestures, and yes, some menus are hard to find at first, but there is a learning curve with everything, BE PATIENT and you will learn to love it!!My ecosystem revolves around Android, so i use Chrome, Google Music, Gmail, GMaps, and there is a solution for all of these on Win 8. The mail app will sync with Gmail, and my work email, and my hotmail. There is a faux-GMaps app, and a 3rd party Google Music app, so it does everything I need.Overall, i love this thing, with small quirks such as touchpad accuracy (not bad at all, just jitters sometimes, i use touch most of the time) and getting used to Win 8, but to me the experience is pretty revolutionary and I have become a fan.Get this computer over the ideapad Yoga, because it has a bigger hard drive for cheaper, and if you're looking for something more compact.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Purchased as gift", "Author": "Barry C.

While I was working my screen would be changing around and re-sizing when I didn't want it to.*Awkward Touchscreen- The touchscreen works okay for larger tiles, but when you want to point at something small, it doesn't seem to line up with what you are trying to touch.* Mouse too Sensitive- When I used the mouse, if I moved too quickly it assume I was doing a gesture and changed my screen size, changed the page or clicked on something I didn't intend. Moving quickly to the right (a common move with a mouse) would change to the next screen.  I was continually having to adjust back to what I was doing.* Win8 Gestures Don't work well- The gestures that Windows 8 does have built in (close window in a swipe from the top, view all windows in a swipe from the left) didn't really work in this laptop.

Lenovo didn't tell me that hard drive wasn't actually available and changed my order to a 128GB SSD without telling me.

I did not want to settle with Windows RT or an Intel ATOM processor because of the limitations. That being said: I saw a few reviews complaining that the screen rotation and the touchpad mouse was very glitchy and did not work properly. I have not had any problems whatsoever. This laptop looks very good in person, a lot of video reviews I saw made the laptop look bulky and \"old\". It is absolutely beautiful with the matte finish (I'm a huge fan of matte black)The touch screen is very responsive and feels good to touch. It is a 5 point touch meaning that it can recognize 5 fingers at once. The overall laptop performance is great, from a cold startup it takes about 10secs or less to hit the start screen. I am able to download games that has high requirements such as speed and graphics, and this laptop worked perfectly. I downloaded multiple items while playing a game and it did not slow down the computer at all which is very impressive.  Also I made sure to install every update possible before using the laptop. Windows 8 does take a little time to learn everything but once you got it, it will be the best os you ever used.

The solid touchpad uses the lower corners to simulate mouse buttons that work fine, but if you're like me and rest your thumb on the left button while using a finger to navigate, the touchpad tends to get confused and the pointer will dance around  not knowing what you're trying to do.- The scroll feature on the touchpad is completely useless.  There's no markings where to slide leading your to search for that sweetspot that you'll never really find.- Auto rotate is hit or miss.- It could use a tiny bit more space between ports on the sides.

Everything works satisfactorily until 4 months later. The laptop wouldn't boot and the error message points at a hard disk drive failure.Request #1: A quick and pleasant call to Lenovo and, two days later, I receive a replacement drive and reinstallation DVDs. The hard drive is used, below the specification of my previous drive... and started to fail noisily in the middle of the reinstallation procedure!Request #2: Calling Lenovo and asking for another drive, which I receive promptly. I install the drive (used parts and below specs again), turn the laptop on and... What's that horrible whining sound?! Conclusion: Yet another failed disk. And to be sure of my diagnostic, I extract an old drive from an old laptop. I successfully reinstall my Lenovo laptop and the old drive.Request #3: Calling Lenovo again. They want me to return the laptop. I make sure they understand the nature of the problem, why returning the laptop makes little sense and why I expect a drive with, at least, the same specifications as the one I originally bought. A week later, the promised drive wasn't there yet (and actually never arrived).Request #4: On the phone with Lenovo... They don't know what happened to the previous drive. They'll send a new one, with the right specifications. I didn't bother opening the drive when I received it, it wasn't the right kind!!! In the meantime, tired of waiting, I had bought a new drive at a local store. Unsurprisingly, it did wonder in my laptop.Request #5: Moving online to avoid being impolite on the phone. There, I go through a weird registration and realized all the limit of their support tools. I almost feel sad for the support people working there. I try my best to describe all the extent of my issues with Lenovo. The field limit to 150 characters don't help, at all. My request: A real solution, in the form of a real drive or a real check to cover the purchase of a new real drive. And, a couple of days later, I receive... an empty box??

The laptop can be a bit finicky at first, but all was well after they were updated.- There was a lot of Bloatware (Lenovo Software) when I first booted it up. None of it is really all that essential, so I uninstalled most of it.- It works well (most of the time) with Windows 8.

The problem with this is that it would leave virtually no space for caching or programs. I would think more than likely that the 24GB is saved for the caching itself. However, the SSD doesn't show up under the drive listing. Plus, why not just add more RAM for caching instead? Something to look into...- Overall it runs fast, cool, and without hiccups.

I am a graduate student, so my primary usage for this laptop is checking email, taking notes in class, entering data and reading pdfs, so I'll be primarily addressing these uses.For taking notes, I downloaded a free windows 8 app called note anytime. I highly recommend it. Although it is fairly easy to write notes with your finger on the touchscreen, after a while it's just easier to use a pen. So I ended up getting a stylus and using this laptop in class to take written notes. The touchscreen is very responsive to writing with little to no delay. I have been taking notes in class with ease by just resting the laptop on my desk. I enjoy using a touchscreen laptop instead of a normal laptop or pen and paper because I am able to draw figures and diagrams with ease, while using the internet to look up information during lectures. Windows 8 has a feature that lets you swipe to switch between screens that is really helpful.For entering data on laptops, one of my pet peeves is that most normal sized laptops lack a number pad. One of the benefits of the lenovo twist is that it has a touchscreen keyboard that includes a number pad that I use quite often.For reading pdfs on the twist, it is very easy to use to annotate and read pdfs. My gripes are that the gorilla glass can have a lot of glare on it in the wrong lighting and that the twist is a bit heavy to hold like an ipad.Overall, I really enjoy using this laptop. The hardware of the twist is solid and any issues that I have had have been related to the learning curve of using Windows 8, except for the battery life. Lenovo advertises up to 7 hours of battery life on the laptop. So in my mind as a consumer, I am expecting to get around 5 hours. In actuality, I can get about 3-4h of usage with each charge. Considering this is supposed to be an ultrabook, this is disappointing. However, for my purposes, I don't use the computer unplugged for more than 2 hours at a time, so this has not hindered my experience.

Lepak", "ReviewID": "R23PAVNRK7IC56", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had this about 3 weeks now.  I don't have a tablet and thought that perhaps this would kill two birds.  It is not as light as a tablet but it is still not too bad on my lap or on a table.  I have been getting used to the touch screen having only owned one on my smartphone before.  I use it mostly in the laptop mode for email as I like to write on the keyboard since I touch type.  I don't find it a problem to reach the 3\" from the keyboard or mouse pad to the screen,  which has become my habit for scrolling pages or using swipe gestures.When I first got the Twist I went to the Lenovo site and updated everything so I haven't had any issues some reviewers have mentioned. It took me awhile to get used to Win8 but I am liking it more and more.  It is a good match to a touch screen.I once had an IBM laptop, 13-14 years ago, with the red mouse button thingy in the middle of the keyboard.  But since then have used just touch pads and mice.  I've tried using it again but find it hard to control the cursor speed and direction so revert to the mouse or touch pad.  Or just use my finger on the screen.  So I think I could do without that feature, but it doesn't hurt to have it there.  There are so many ways to interact with this computer that I see new habits forming.I have one complaint/frustration with this laptop so far, which I hope to resolve in the future. Although the screen scrolling and swiping seems flawless, I have had trouble with tapping, often needing to tap an icon 3 or 4 times to get an action.  The manual says to calibrate the screen frequently but I could not find directions for how to do it.  I went online and downloaded a calibration tool for Lenovo even though it said it was for Win7. (Couldn't find one for Win8) When I went to install it a pop up said I already had it on my computer so I did not install and override what I supposedly had.  Well, I have not been able to locate it on my computer.  But right after downloading it,  it popped up on the screen and when I touched the red button in the center it said, \"No device found\", with no directions about what to do about it.  I haven't seen it since.  Since then I have not put any effort into pursuing this and often find I use the mouse and keyboard buttons for clicking.  It does seem like it is getting better though, which may just be my technique improving.  Some time in the future I will work on figuring out screen calibration again as it is somewhat frustrating to have to go back and forth from the screen to buttons or touch pad, and I cannot do that when it is in tablet mode..One other tiny quibble:  I bought a mini hdmi to regular hdmi adapter, which works fine.  I always hook up to a 32\" monitor when I am at home.  But the usb port next to it is so close  that the swelled shape of the adapter pushes against my usb tethering hookup and I have my wireless mouse in the other usb port.  Hopefully the pressure between them won't damage anything.  So next time I would get an hdmi adapter with a little wire on it.  Some usb plugs would probably not fit next to it at all.", "Date": "April 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "I had such high hopes but this machine is awful", "Author": "JB", "ReviewID": "R1KR0CPZ6XG48B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this at a big box store with high hopes.

It took talking to four customer reps in India (after 6pm) to try to get an answer as to whether my order in my cart was matching what I wanted. For whatever reason I could not get a definite answer, I then decided to call during normal business hours. Spoke with a rep to get an answer and still could not get a definitive answer.Called the next day and spoke with another rep, got a definitive answer from her, she informed me \"yes she can order and customize a Think-pad X230T convertible for me.\" We proceeded to customize my order. Finally I was going to get the product I wanted, and it was not cheap, especially with the customization. She then told me that she would send me a quote to verify the order before it was processed. I received an email later on that afternoon of the supposed quote and it was a cut and paste of their website, unbelievable!!! I called Lenovo once again, spoke with a rep about the \"supposed quote,\" he informed me that he would contact the sales team to inform them of the error and someone should be calling me later on that day. Needless to say, I did not receive the phone call.Two days later I received an email that my order was being shipped. I then called back to cancel the order and a rep told me it was too late to cancel the order. I would have to receive the item and then call back for a return label. I called the following day and asked to speak to a supervisor. They put me on hold for 15 minutes, after fifteen minutes I hung up. I then redialed and again asked to speak to a supervisor, again I was put on hold for another 20 minutes (they were probably hoping I would get tired of waiting and hung up). When they figured out I was not going to hang up, they hung up on me. I then found a Think-pad S230U at my local Micro-Center. I really wanted try this product out. Once I got it home, unpacked the box, charged the battery, it showed 2hrs of battery time. It stated in the specs that it was an 8 cell lithium battery. There is no way that this battery should be showing 2hours. I spoke with a representative at Micro-Center to let them know I needed an exchange.

I liked the fact that I could use it as a tablet.Here is what I like.1) It's very lightweight and portable.2) As a photographer, I love the fact that the screen adjusts to the light.3) With the exceptions below, this laptop functions very well. I am able to do all of my work, as long as the screen doesn't decide to rotate on it's own or some swipe gesture is triggered while I am trying to work.4) It's pretty sturdy. I've lugged it around all over the place and even dropped it a couple of times.Here is what I don't like.1) It gets hot. This makes the tablet function, for me, fairly useless. You would not want to hold this on your lap for very long.2) The gestures on the touch pad. This was a huge, gigantic pain in the ass to get rid of. Today, I can't even tell you how I did it. I had to remove the driver and re-install it and spent hours fixing the settings. I did not need these gestures. I have a touch screen. If I want gestures, I'll touch my screen. Trying to use the touch pad to move the mouse cursor around was difficult because gestures would constantly be triggered. I prefer this to using the little red mouse button. This is a preference that should be accounted for int he touch pad settings.3)I'm not sure if this is Windows 8 or my computer, but my internet connection gets dropped a lot, requiring me to reboot my laptop. I know that the issue is with the laptop and not the wireless router because everyone around me is onlne when this happens.4) I can't swipe the screen and get the charms bar. I haven't seen it for months. I started researching a solution for this and gave up after a while.5) Auto Rotate triggers by itself for reasons that I haven't quite figured out. For a while, I was having issues not being able to get out of the rotated screen. A driver update helped with that.I probably would not buy this laptop again.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "worst computer I have ever had, and I've had many", "Author": "Shahrezade", "ReviewID": "R3SN60P35S6UZ4", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Slow, dim screen, VERY buggy, I really may end up smashing it.

When I say that this laptop is the worst thing you can probably buy with your money, go on a hunt for something better.I am a college student who is aiming for education beyond college. So when I as browsing through laptops, I looked for portability, sturdiness, endurance, fast processes, and of course affordability. Most important feature I was looking into was endurance since I may have to use the newly purchased laptop beyond college and into the workforce.This laptop is no mean cheap; this is reasonably priced I would say because this is very sturdy which maintains the integrity of Lenovo. However, what really struck me to buy this item is the hybrid functionality of switching between a laptop and a tablet. I've heard many good things about Lenovo so I went ahead to purchase this product. Now, I will never purchase any Lenovo Ultrabook EVER again.This is my second Lenovo product that I've purchased and the first was Lenovo Yoga 13. I liked the model a lot, I'm not gonna lie. The model was thin, light, fast, but a bit expensive. Within a few weeks I returned it because of mousepad problems. The right click didn't work in some websites which I didn't understand. Also, the memory was WAY TOO SMALL for a student who's always typing and making documents for school. So unfortunately, that was out.A few weeks later, I found Lenovo twist. I thought this laptop was perfect because it's under 4 pounds, compact, touchscreen (which I really grew into liking) and twice the memory of those of Yoga, being that it is still an Ultrabook. If I can rewind back in time, I would have never purchased this product.The first problem with this laptop is the POWER BUTTON.It's a very tiny button on the lower right side of the screen right below the lock button, which is used during tablet mode. You have to press this button VERY HARD or MANY TIMES or else, it won't turn on. Sometimes, it doesn't respond to the button so much that I pressed this for a good 30 sec and it just turned on and off by itself. WTF lenovo.The second problem is the SCREEN.There's nothing wrong with the touchscreen. Actually, it's very responsive and it feels just like a touchphone. It's not as smooth as an iPad but, not bad.The problem with the screen is the FLIPLOCK. This model is a hybrid of tablet and laptop. So when you twist the screen, it automatically read which side is upright and it changes the configuration. It doesn't understand when I'm using it as a laptop or a tablet. However, the quick fix for this is the LOCK button above the POWER button. And guess what? It doesn't read my inputs correctly either! So I'm stuck with a tablet screen whilst in a laptop mode!! I understand there's a quick fix for this but I don't want a quick fix! I want my laptop to be normally fucntional! It's freaking new, so why is it acting like I used this for years??the third and the BIGGEST turnoff for this model is the MOUSEPADOMG it is SO POORLY made. The mousepad feels really, really course and thick. So naturally, I thought it won't read your inputs easily. I was wrong.This mousepad is so HYPERSENSITIVE that it doesn't understand a light touch from a tap. It highlights EVERYTHING that I'm trying to read and in one instance deleted my texts. Do you know how much I suffered from this mousepad?And please, don't tell me 'you can uninstall the driver and download the older version' or 'change the settings of your mouse' or 'update the mousepad driver' or even 'download a separate mouse program' because I've done ALL of that and NOTHING seems to work. Now I have to opt out to use the nipple and even THAT doesn't understand my movements. This is a HARDWARE problem. Not the software. Sometimes, it reads the pressure of my wrist resting on the side of the laptop as a click. So it's not software, it's an internal malfunction. Lenovo, fix your damn mousepads. It's terrible. Get it right or you're gonna lose customers.Fourth problem is with WifiTo be really honest, the wifi connection is bad in ways that it keeps getting disconnected but since I'm so distracted by other horrific features, this is in the shadows of flaws in this model. Good thinking Lenovo!Keep in mind, this was not manufacturer refurbished, used, or damaged. This was absolutely new and I was the first person to use the computer. If I could I would SO return this in a heartbeat but since Lenovo's warranty sucks (I would have to mail this to TX to fix in weeks!) and I don't have money to buy another model, I's stuck with this piece of crap. My Squaretrade warranty wouldn't help me and I can't even return this through Amazon because if I send this laptop over, what am I gonna use in school?!?! This was my first time trying out Lenovo because I've heard SO many great things about this brand and how it keeps its integrity in each model.I agree that it keeps its integrity as in if I drop this laptop it would not break. But the normal functionality just SUCKS.So thanks for ripping off a college student Lenovo. I hope you're happy.
