Having the SSD gets my computer up an running before I can blink. My games run flawlessly!! It is also very quiet, lighter weight than my Asus was, and is overall a beautiful piece of machinery. Couldn't be happier.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very nice", "Author": "cheesenfleas", "ReviewID": "R3SQNLTYYIN2I9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've had the P27k for a few weeks now. I had one driver failure after upgrade to Windows 8.1, but it was easily fixed with an automated driver update from the device manager. I primarily run Adobe Creative Cloud on this machine and it works flawlessly. The price was also extremely satisfying after viewing comparable products from other companies. There is a newer model out, but the only difference is a newer video card. I am confident enough in this computer to say that I will not be upgrading again (maybe max out the ram) for another 4-5 years... You will be pleased if you choose to purchase this.", "Date": "May 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "The information on the title is partially incorrect", "Author": "Peter", "ReviewID": "R11TGWPJIVPAQ7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The add says that this is a Gigabyte P27K with a 15.6-inch display.
