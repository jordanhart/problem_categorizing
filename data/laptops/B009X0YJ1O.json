{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Elegant entertainment machine", "Author": "Sim", "ReviewID": "RL27PIIF5PJFH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The full sized  keyboard is nice, and benefits from the integrated numeric pad. The keys have a firm response and smooth motion. Even better, the keyboard comes standard with backlight that vastly improves keyboard usability in dark environments. Though the multitouch clickpad used by HP has proven in the past to be problematic, it looks to me as though HP has done the work to polish out some of the rough spots. When I used it the multitouch support was smooth and accurate, letting me use two-fingered scrolling and zoom without difficulty.The 17.3-inch screen is a standout feature, providing a 1,920 by 1,080 resolution (Full HD 1080p), and also displays high-definition 3D content. Using HP's 3D Ultra BrightView display technology, the picture was not only clear and bright, but also ramped up the brightness to compensate for the dimming effect seen when viewing through 3D glasses.The larger screen provided a great display, but also makes for a laptop that's big and heavy. When closed, the Envy 17 3D measures 16.38 inches long and 10.83 inches wide. Though fairly slim, measuring 1.25 inches in depth at its thinnest point, it's still a hefty unit, weighing 7.5 pounds. That's not unusual for a desktop replacement laptop--the ASUS G51J-1B 3D weighed the same-but its still too big and heavy to pack on a daily commute.Thanks to the active shutter 3D glasses which are bundled with the laptop, the Envy 17 3D presents 3D content while maintaining the crystal clear clarity offered by the 1080p screen. The included glasses manage to look more stylish than dorky, and they fit easily over prescription eyeglasses.The Blu-ray drive, which supports Blu-ray 3D, also plays 2D Blu-ray movies, and will read and burn both DVDs and CDs. Those who dislike tray-loading DVD-drives will appreciate the slot-style optical drive of the Envy 17 3D, which is similar to the one found on Apple MacBook Pro 17-inch.", "Date": "October 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "HP envy 17t-3200 3d Edition laptop", "Author": "TimBentz", "ReviewID": "R1G1WDA7OZ2UE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Love it so far!
