It arrived on time and looked great out of the box. I switched it on and was running windows in less than 5 mts.. The keyboard and scroll pad are nice. Charged the battery to 100% and did video/audio streaming for 3.5 hrs continuously. The battery lasted all along with 13% left after 3.5 hrs. The laptop also felt cool. Excellent graphics and HD pictures. I think the laptop will easily last 5.5 to 6 hrs on normal use. That is value for my money right there. The webcam, mic and LED screen are decent. There are 3 USB ports and there is also a sleep n charge, which means I don't have to have the computer on to charge my USB devices. That is a cool feature. Also, the laptop weighs abt 5.5 lbs and that is not too bad to carry around. I have owned 3 HP laptops before and this is my first Toshiba laptop. I'm very happy with it.The price is an advantage. $479.99 for a quad core processor with excellent graphics and all standard features. I did not pay tax or shipping to amazon. This is the best deal I found online for a great processing power, excellent battery life, everyday computing laptop. Did I mention it did not produce any heat? I saved around $20 on a cooling pad!Just one gripe for me: There is no volume control button on the keyboard.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "A very good laptop except for the BIOS bug", "Author": "Pam M.", "ReviewID": "R37P1WX8SDJ2R8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I really liked this laptop a lot but unfortunately received one of the pieces with a faulty BIOS. If you put the laptop to sleep, upon \"waking\" it, the systems starts (you can tell that by the sound of the hard disk whirring and other system sounds) but the display does not resume and remains dark. I tried reinstalling the display driver but that didn't help. Apparently, the solution is to update the BIOS which should be done by experienced users only (which I am not) to avoid bricking the laptop. Having said that here are the pros and consPROs:Quad Core Processor: I bought this laptop for $430 and that is a great, great price for a quad core. I was apprehensive about buying an AMD based machine at first but upon comparing it with an Intel core i3 2350M machine; I found that the A6 is a much better processor.RADEON HD 6520G: The highlight of this machine is the 6520G GPU. For a low end machine this GPU gives amazing performance. I am casual gamer so buying a machine with a dedicated card wouldn't have been cost effective for me. I was happy to discover that I could play graphics intensive games like Crysis, Crysis 2, Modern Warfare 2 & 3, Battlefield 3  at 1366 x 720 resolution with 30 - 40 fps easily. The Intel HD 3000 sucks at all these games.CONs:The only con was the nasty BIOS bug. I think Toshiba got a batch of faulty BIOSes and some of the laptops are acting up because of that, which is shame really as the performance of this laptop at such a low price point is really nice. But thankfully Amazon came to the rescue here with their wonderful return policy and that is one of the reasons I gave 4 stars and not lower.

First the computer screen would not wake up from sleep mode.  Lucky I found a post on Toshiba support site that state installing the latest version of the US bios (v1.5 in this case).  I did that and that fixed the sleep problem.  Secondly, the screen color is wash out, not very vivid.  I tried adjusting the software settings and only manage to improve it slightly.  Over all not bad for the price, I would of return it immediately if I couldn't fix the sleep problem, luckily I did fixed it.Here's the link to the Toshiba forum post, note that Toshiba didn't even respond to the poster.. really lack of online support there:[...]Here's the link to the bios download that I use.. be sure it is compatible with your system before updating your bios, this is for info only:[...]*Edit 5/1/12*I decided to return the laptop.  Battery life couldn't last more than 1.5 hours, I couldn't even finish the DVD I was watching.  Toshiba quality has really declined lately, first there was sleep/wake problem with the Thrive tablet, then now there this laptop with horrible battery, same sleep/wake issue, wash out/low quality screen.

Then the hard drive failed.  No problem, it's still under warranty, that's what I thought.  So I ship it to them to fix, and they replace the hard drive, and we're good to go, right?  NOPE!  The second hard drive failed within 4 weeks.  But once that one failed, the machine was out of warranty.  Even though the hard drive was essentially brand new.  Did they do anything to remedy the situation?  No.  They refused.  I pursued it as far as I could, they refused to \"escalate\" my claim, meaning that whoever manages the people in the Philipines that I spent way too much time on the phone with decided I wasn't worth the trouble.  I pulled the HD out at one point, by the way, to verify that it was bad- and it was a no name piece of junk that Maxtor would probably reject.  And in case you're wondering- the machine was never dropped, mishandled in any way, nothing was spilled on it, no bad software ever uploaded to it...  Nothing.Toshiba is an embarassment of a company, and I sincerely hope that this review inspires everyone to avoid anything with that brand name.  Not just to punish the company for a complete failure to do something right, but to save others the hassle and complete waste of money synonymous with \"Toshiba.\"  They do not stand behind their products, they do not care if their customer was ripped off by their lack of functionality, they do not deserve anyone's business.Trust me on this people- spend the extra fifty bucks and get an HP, a Dell, or something to that effect.

No plans to buy another Toshiba product in the future.  My money is hard to come by and it would be several years before I could buy another laptop and represents a special splurge on myself.

And for $400-450 its definitely a very solid choice. (when getting to $500 you may be able to find A8 cpus, and possibly 2nd generation A8s)It exceeds all expectations, and was first chance testing out the AMD A-series and that too also exceeded my expectations, and is quite an amazing cpu.Ok the laptop.it has a nice look to it, and the keyboard/trackpad have a nice feel to them. It runs very cool (runs under 50C at 100% load while undervolted, and stock thermal compound), the speakers are pretty good for built in laptop ones. It also has great battery life (can easily get 5hrs of normal net browsing on max battery life settings that are tweaked a bit, and lower brightness and undervolted to the max).The laptop is on the thick side, but its ok.I used a generic windows 7 disc to completely wipe the laptop, and all the bloatware and toshiba setting which should always be done on a new or used laptop. It really increases performance. (ofcourse you need to get network drivers from the toshiba site beforehand).Did that, did all the updates, runs great.The laptop comes with 2 2GB ddr3 1333 sticks of rm in dual channel (the ram is very important for integrated graphics. So using 1333 over 1066 does help the graphic performance alittle bit, but running in dual channel is a MUST for it, as it almost doubles the fps).Has 640GB 5400rpm hdd. nothing special. 5400rpm drives always suck and are slow. Though they are pretty standard in laptops. Recommend upgrading to a 7200rpm.The really nice thing about the AMD A-series is that they have fully unlocked multipliers, making them overclock able (the only laptop cpus to be overclocked!). Now you really need to know what you are doing, it is NOT recommended to do this! You will cause irreversable damage to your laptop if done incorrectly.[...] is what you can use to either overclock or undervolt.Undervolting is the process of lower the voltage to the cpu, which will increase battery life and lowers temps! there is little you can do to cause damage with undervolting, so its definitely something to do. If you go too low, you will blue screen, and just restart and tht means you cant go that low, and back up a step in voltage. Each cpu is different, so there is no default value for stable voltages. So its almost impossible you will use the same settings as me.Also im sure people will ignore my warning and overclock anyway, but be warned WHEN you do, do NOT raise voltage over stock... dont even use stock voltage. You should be using lower then stock voltage.You NEED to get a decent notebook cooler. I have voltage quite a few notches below stock, and OC 4 cores to 2.4ghz and while 100% and gaming (so the gpu on the chip is also under load), it gets between 65-75C with a notebook cooler. This is also with stock thermal compound, which replacing it can really help if you OC. Also just disable the turbo core or w/e.overclocked this cpu beats out the sandy bridge core i3s. and people have been known to get them to 2.8-3.0ghz which matches an i5 sandy bridge. BUT i really dont recommend you even try to do anything like this...Anyway the graphics 6520G (with dual channel ddr3 1333) can play any game there is on low settings at 1366x768 resolution with ease at 30+ fps. I actually got skyrim to hit over 30fps on med settings with cpu at 2.4ghz, tho some parts can still get laggy.But ya, great budget laptop to be able to play games on. and this laptop in particular is really great all around.I had no problems with bios that came with this laptop i got, and you people are crazy... you act like ALL hardware is 100% working all the time out of the factory.... ofcourse any brand, any hardware, anything is bound to have problems, and thats the point of bios updates. You act like download the bios update, putting it on a cd or usb drive, and booting from the cd/usb drive is SUCH a hard chore... give me a break...Most all problems people have with any computer, stems from user ignorance, not the manufacturer.

I did a bit of Googling, power cycled the computer, ran it with/without battery etc. Some combination of events worked. Once the battery was detected the laptop has worked like a charm. But this could cause initial stress. I knew the issue existed and the whole thing didn't take me much time to fix so this issue eluded my recollection when I first wrote the review. This should count against Toshiba but I am so happy with its performance I am going to leave the rating at 5. Consider it a diamond in the rough.I have had this for close to 2 months now. I use it for many hours daily. This replaces another Toshiba Satellite (L505) I bought over two years ago and is a great improvement over the previous model. The AMD processor has very satisfactory performance. I don't think I have ever come close to exercising the full power of the four cores. The fans are very quiet. While the air from the vent is hot the bottom of the computer stays cool all the time. The screen is of good quality with accurate colors. The battery life is close to what is claimed. I am very happy with it. Now with that said if this is the only computing device you plan to have you should be aware that there are caveats:1) It is lighter than most other competitors at this price point but it is still pretty heavy. That is a price you have to pay for a 15.6 screen.2) The screen, when closed, flexes when you carry the computer around in hands. That doesn't give one the securest feeling about the screen (being safe from damage in the process). I don't move it around that much so that is not a problem for me.3) The web cam quality is fairly low.4) The 4GB SDRAM takes up both slots so you won't be able to upgrade without removing one or both. On the other hand you know from day one that both slots work (my previous model only uses one slot but it turned out the open slot was faulty when I tried to upgrade later). 4GB should be sufficient for most. I have many programs open at the same time including both IE and Chrome browsers (which tend to be memory hogs) and memory capacity has never been a problem (while on my previous model with 2GB I knew that memory was the bottleneck).", "Date": "August 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "great preformance but small hiccups", "Author": "mags", "ReviewID": "RN4PENL6UNN3F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I live in Trinidad and Tobago and decided to purchase this product after reviewing many other products.

I have a toddler that decided to knock the top of the lid on the outside and it cracked slightly so I suggest to ensure to not have any items touch the lid on the outside.

At that point, I decided it was time to return it and get my money back.

Experienced a problem with the wireless adapter turned off. Did a google search and found if the battery is removed and replaced the switch will turn on. This did work but two days later when starting up the laptop there was a window stating system encountered a startup problem and a fix was being implimented. After the fix the wireless adapter was turned off with no way to turn it on. I once again removed the Batt. replaced. This worked again.Because this is not the correct way to turn on the wireless adapter I called Toshiba and after much difficulty I finnally got to a live person. After a long time getting him to understand the problem I was told it was caused by an improper shutdown and they could fix it at a cost of $99.When I explained this unit was only 5 or 6 months old he said because of the alledged improper shut down the warranty did not cover the fix.I then started to tell him that was unexceptable and he said goodby and hung up.Customer service the TOSHIBA way.I would not recommend Toshiba to anyone!!!", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Am a Fan of Satellite", "Author": "Samir Sobhy", "ReviewID": "R10TE5ADH46MQE", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my 8th Toshiba Satellite lap top in 14 years! It will replace one of the 3 I am currently using in 3 different homes in 2 countries! None of the 8 laptops went wrong. The reason I changed so many is the constant need for larger memory capacity as new soft wear always require stronger RAM.Obviously, I am totally satisfied with the performance, design, and durability of this line by Toshiba. This model L 755D, has stronger RAM: a maximum of 8 GB, a high performance processor, and a 64-bit operating system, in addition to the now-standard features: Webcam, wireless WiFi, Windows 7, etc.I read in some reviews about some glitches with this model. I only just starting to use it. Hope it will continue to work well.

Amazon's customer service quickly provided a second laptop.  Much to my dismay, the second laptop also would not charge the battery.Toshiba customer/technical service was not very helpful.  I ended up ordering a battery from their warranty claim site.  If I get charged for the replacement battery, I will be contesting the charge. I have been a Toshiba customer for many years, but I will think twice about ordering a Toshiba product in the future.Update: I've gone from one star to four or five.  The computer is great. I've purchased four of them now.  Two things you must do in order to get them working properly. First you must charge the battery overnight without the computer on.  For some reason, the first time it takes 3 or 4 hours before charging begins.  It will not charge the first time with the computer on.  Second, you need to update the bios to fix the screen issue.
