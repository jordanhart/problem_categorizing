Thank God I bought the warranty because the system board and the DVD drive needed replacement. It no longer overheats, but the DVD drive still does not open. The screen is beautiful and the machine is fast. The headaches regarding this laptop are more than you'd like. Do yourself a favor and shop around. I thought Toshiba was top of the line. I still think highly of Toshiba, just not this model.

The speed is fast.  The wireless is flawless.And it heats up when gaming and SHUTS OFF!  Often.  The cooling fans are:  One on the right side (right where you'd have your trackball/mouse, and two on the bottom of the machine.  \"Do not block the fans\" they say.  Well, um, I don't possess the skills to levitate the machine off a flat surface, so that's out.  I bought some fancy laptop cooler thing to set the machine on.  It does not help.After a few months of owning this laptop, this problem seems to be getting worse.  The only thing I could do to stop the overheating was to buy a small 6 inch fan with a clamp on it, clamp it to my desk, and point it directly at the rear of the laptop.This is poorly designed in my opinion.  From reading other reviews around the world, I understand this model has been discontinued, Toshiba customer service is an abomination, and the speakers are made of metal and there is a shock/reboot problem on some machines.  0_oAnd if that is not enough for ya, it periodically boots with the sound disabled.  Only way to get it working again is to unplug the power, take out the battery, and hold the power button for one minute.  FUN!Oh yeah, and no internal mic.AVOID.", "Date": "May 7, 2005"}, {"Title": "crap", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RFFIOX7J5159D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "this computer is so slow.the screen freezes every 10 days so when it freezes i have to take out the battery.this crap wastes all my time.when installing 1 simple program it takes at least 10-20 minutes for the program to be instaled.i had to fix this computer twice in the last month.another big problem is the overheating.the 1st day i got the computer it started heating up so rapidly i could not stop it.now i have to carry a portable fan where ever i go so it does not overheat.every time you have a 50 50 percent chance of having internet connection.it takes a long time to load a page on the web and it takes a long time load programs and send mail.im a macintosh kind of guy. i have no clue why i bought this pile of crap in the first place.i will never buy a toshiba again.id recomend buying a macintosh.well anyway have fun dealing with this box full of crap.", "Date": "January 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Best laptop ever", "Author": "R.
