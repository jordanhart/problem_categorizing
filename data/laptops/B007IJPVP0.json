After seeing the specs on this computer, they came off to be very impressive. I decided to purchase this laptop before reading into reviews. I brought it home, unboxed it and started setting up Windows. The computer didn't even make it through the initial process before freezing and shutting down. I took it back to Best Buy and the Geek Squad told me the motherboard fried. I made a complete exchange and got a working one.After installing and setting up this laptop, I can tell you that there are some quirks that can be extremely irritating but there are ways around them.#1 - The touchpad is very finicky out of the box. Samsung has a driver update for the touchpad that gives you ample options to fix it by turning off some of it's features and being able to adjust others.#2 - Streaming video/YouTube full screen pixelation. Because of the odd resolution this computer displays, YouTube videos have an odd pixelation when in full screen mode. This issue is fixed with the installation of the JW Player scripts available from userscripts.org.#3 - Switchable graphics. In my experience so far, the AMD dedicated graphics card is basically worthless. The computer runs tasks faster and with no issues off the Intel chipset. Switch your graphics to \"power saving\" for best results in applications.Other than those issues which I've stated, I love the computer. It's extremely fast for what I've used it for so far, I can run Adobe Photoshop CS5.1, Lightroom 4, and Audition 5.5 with no issues or lag at all. The computer is COMPLETELY silent compared to anything else i've used, I haven't even had the fans kick on at all yet. It runs quiet and cool. The backlit keyboard is very nice, and the computer's casing is very attractive. It feels very well built. The speakers are loud and clear. The display is very clear and bright.In addition to the 1TB 5400rpm (A little slow on paper, I think i'm going to replace it with a full SSD drive), it has an 8gb SSD for faster start up times and let me tell you, it's quick!I would recommend this laptop for someone who has patience, as it can be finicky at times but all in all, it's an impressive machine to me.", "Date": "April 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very impressive feature to price point relationship, great performer", "Author": "Robert J. Lorenzini", "ReviewID": "R2N4HPSPXWBH65", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is basically Samsung doing their best impression of a Mac Book Pro.  However the MAC book Pro with the same spec (and the Retina display) willrun you $2100.00 I bought this laptop for $959.I am completely impressed by the performance and styling of this laptop and very satisfied by the performance of this machine.  I use this PC for some demanding applications.  The i7 quad core processer coupled with a dedicated GPU in a ultra-thin portable machine with 8 gb of ram... you cannot go wrong.First question is what do I use the laptop for?I use Photoshop CS4, Visual Studio 2010  (IDE for software development/programming), SQL server 2008 for development purposes, Video editing in various programs, lightroom, running Office 2010 etc.... I also do quite a bit of gaming in Skyrim and Diablo III.  I do travel for work so this any laptop I use must be very portable.Most of these software applications are extremely demanding.So the question is can you do all of this effectively with a 5 lbs laptop that is ultra thin?  The answer is yes.Here are some notes about my experiences and thoughts about this machine.THE GOOD:>  Great style, clean lines and unbelieveably quiet.> Full keyboard that is well designed and very similiar to a regular plug in keyboard.> In power saving mode I have gotten 7 hours on the battery.  I can get 3 hours on the battery while gaming... still very pretty impressive.> The multi-tasking is quite incredible, I can run Skyrim, Vs 2010 and photoshop at the same time with little to no issues.> The dedicated graphics card is impressive.  If you look at notebook check [...]  for gaming this dedicated GPU rates quite high.>  The quick start up is awesome, this machines goes from sleeping to running in about 5-10 seconds. This is an awesome feature.> The most demanding application I run are Skyrim. It is completely playable at medium details.  It can manage 30-50 fps (frames per second) with the setting turned up for character definition.  This is quite amazing if you think about the size of this laptop.  I have run it with the detail settings on high, but the game is unplayable the fps drop below 30 for scenes that have large rendering demands like scenes with water etc.> For Visual Studio 2010 (which is a processor killer) the machines handles it amazing well.> The touchpad is really great.  Many reviewers have indicated that it does not work well.  I have worked on MACs and this works as well if not better than the mac touchpad.> Matte screen = no glare... love it.THE BAD:> There is occasional screen flicker when switching between demanding applications or coming in and out of a gaming session.  This is a very minor annoyance but it is present.  The laptop is designed to switch between>  The temp while gaming...  The machine has a very streamlined appearance with little to no venting. While this looks good it is a bit unpractical.According to my speed fan tests at 2 hours the CPU gets to around 70C while gaming and the GPU gets to 65C.  To the touch the laptop is not hot but this is less than ideal from my perspective.My geek squad friends say laptops are designed to run hotter, the CPU I have is rated to 100c before you begin having problems.  The solution is to use it with Cooler Master NotePal X2 Laptop Cooling Pad.  This laptop is so small that you can easily fit a cooling pad and laptop in a laptop backpack without issue.  So you will have to be mindful of the heat if you are going to buy this machine, keep the vent clean.> Function keys are slow to respond....  The shortcut function keys for adjusting brightness, touchpad, volume, fan, wifi etc are super cool but they are slow to respond. This is annoying and could be improved.> One more USB port would be nice.>  The screen seems mediocre to me...  So I should preface this by saying that I am bit picky about screens.  I work typically on very high quality dual monitors.  When I switch to this laptop the contrast and brightness under perform... but what do you want in such a small screen.>  The built in speakers leave alot to be desired in my opinion, this is typical of laptops but I have seen better performance from laptop speakers.All in all when you consider the fe", "Date": "August 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung laptop just what I needed", "Author": "Guylene Gadal", "ReviewID": "R2YK6MT08DWXJ6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung Series 7 NP700Z5A-S0AUS 15.6-Inch Laptop (Silver)It comes down to what do you want out of a laptop.  The Samsung 700Z5B provided what I needed at a fair price.  Went shopping for a good laptop with Intel i7, 6 to 8 GB of memory, and internal DVD.  I became disappointed with the other brands. This laptop is fast, light weight, does not get hot like some HP laptops do.  Love the backlit keyboard for early morning work.  I don't mind the touchpad since I always use an external mouse.

I'll admit that there was a learning curve there, but worth it!  Great display, great specs, cool and quiet operation.  Not sure there is a better combination of utility and style in the Windows world when it comes to laptops, especially at this price.  Hopefully stability and durability will live up to this early assessment.", "Date": "April 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Not a user friendly Laptop", "Author": "SamBlog", "ReviewID": "RFA3YDB3BQU0E", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Well, it acts like a smart laptop with the auto dimming and an overly sensitive touch pad that grabs everything on the screen. I attempted to adjust the touch pad sensitivity unsuccessfully so I decided to buy a wireless mouse and disabled the crappy touch pad when I use this laptop.  The speakers on this laptop is less than adequate. If your daily life isn't frustrating enough, get this laptop and it will keep you busy adjusting the LCD brightness just so you can see what you're doing.  A few simple words I have for this laptop is: WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP!  I bought it for the simple fact that it is a slim design but I guess I will have to put up with other bulkier brand of notebooks from now on.", "Date": "February 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "An unsung hero", "Author": "Nick O", "ReviewID": "R29EB5K3AG2TCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Series 7 gives you a near-macbook-pro laptop at half the price.  The back-lit keyboard, long battery life, and aggressive power saving features make this notebook one that you'll carry around with you.  One of the odder things that I liked was how close the screen is to the edge of the case.  It meant that relative to the size of the computer you're getting more screen space!  The sensitivity of the keyboard and touchpad are great.  It feels like Samsung created a quality product from quality components.One thing I will certainly look into is upgrading the harddrive to an ssd.  A computer of this caliber is worth a finishing touch like that.

Bowden", "ReviewID": "RO1VZ863XVDM5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "1.) The touchpad. The touchpad drives me crazy. I've applied the hotfix, and it is still the worst touchpad in the history of the idea. I will routinely be dragging something only to have it drop for no good reason. I'll routinely be moving the cursor across the screen, and randomly activating every icon I move over. But, of course, when I ACTUALLY want to click on something, I'll pound away to no avail. And the actual \"clickable\" part of the touchpad is even worse than the tappable part. Very little distinction between left and right click. This is a really really poor touchpad.2.) The function keys. I am unable to adjust the screen brightness via the function keys. Have been on with tech support, to the point where I was told to reinstall Windows. This seems like a minor problem, but I find myself needing to adjust the brightness frequently, so I have to go through a menu which takes about three times as long as the function keys would.3.) The screen. Generally hard to read and washed out. Very limited viewing angle.Bottom line is that this machine works great as a desktop (plugged into a mouse, keyboard, and monitor), but fails in a few keys ways as a laptop. And Samsung tech support is not really up to the task of fixing the problems.", "Date": "December 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Slow internet connection", "Author": "Atul Shukla", "ReviewID": "RZAVKRTE0C6A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Hi, i have been using this laptop for past 9 months.

Could just be me. Screen always has imprints from the keyboard - guess I should wash my hands more frequently. Wowed me at first, then I loaded Office and Adobe suites and now it doesn't seem to boot $1000 faster than my 7 year old laptop. I seem to run out of USB ports and miss having a VGA connector, although I understand I can purchase an adapter. Seems like touch pad enables itself every time it comes out of power saving mode. I like the compact design after lugging around a 17\" with a full size keyboard and don't miss the extra real estate as much as I thought I would. Would I buy again or recommend to a friend - no.
