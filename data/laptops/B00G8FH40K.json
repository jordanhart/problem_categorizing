They mostly cost $800+. I was ecstatic when I found this laptop and am so happy with the screen. Everything is so crisp and clear.Also the laptop is fast and responsive. And light. Which doesn't hurt ;)I will probably through in an SSD soon. I took off the back to see if that was feasible and it totally IS! There are a lot of screws to get the back off, but once it's off, the HDD and RAM and Wifi card are right there waiting for repair or upgrade!", "Date": "April 15, 2014"}, {"Title": "nice one!", "Author": "silly cat", "ReviewID": "RRKTRQOLNP3FB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great specs, full HD screen and touch screen feature is awesome.

It is a fantastic deal for a laptop with these specs. I've been using it almost daily since I purchased it for word documents and productivity, as well as games, web browsing, and media.  Pros:  Excellent 1920X1080 touchscreen 15.6\". I absolutely love the screen on this laptop in comparison to other laptops. The only complaint I could possibly have about the screen is that it is not anti-glare, and I find myself washing my fingerprints off of it periodically. However, when used inside, the fingerprints/glare don't bother me at all.  Intel i5 is an excellent processor, can chew through video rendering very quickly  Vent placement is perfect, optimal, I've never gotten the laptop over 85C through multitudes of stress tests on CPU, GPU, and both at the same time. A friend's laptop with similar specs has vents placed in a way that causes it to overheat all the time, I couldn't be more happy with the ventilation.Battery lasts me all day with periodic use. Battery only significantly impacted when doing heavy CPU / GPU work, which I normally do when connected to wall anyways. I run it in High Performance mode all the time, and it lasts me 8 hours of periodic sleep-mode and normal use (word documents, web browsing).It's not made by Apple.It's $500, as opposed to over $1000.  Negatives:5400 RPM Laptop drive Model: ST500LT012-9WS142The hard drive is the only thing slowing me down with this laptop. I ordered a $100 256GB SSD from Crucial and it will vastly improve performance. If waiting for programs to load for 5-10 more seconds doesn't bother you, then this will not be a problem. I am spoiled with my 7200 RPM drives in my desktop.The touchpad works, it isn't the best touchpad I've ever used, but I find myself disabling it most of the time in favor of use of the touchscreen. It seems sort of redundant, but I've used it occasionally in certain situations where my finger is too big to accurately hit something (lol)  Other Thoughts:The GPU, Intel HD 4000, is of course, integrated laptop graphics. I have to admit, I didn't set high standards for this portion of the laptop, and as you would expect, it's not going to run any intense-graphical games. However, most games I play on the laptop don't need intense GPU, and therefore I almost never have problems with laggy gameplay. I can even play Counter-Strike: Global Offensive fairly effectively on it.  I'd recommend this laptop to those with a budget, looking for a laptop that will carry them through environments such as college, or those who just want a portable computer that can do a majority of the things that their desktop can. I give this laptop 5/5 stars because it has saved my butt in a lot of things that I could not have done without it, and it has been near-perfect for all of the things I've used it for. I recommend the purchase of Office 2013 with this laptop, if your life involves Word documents and the like. Office 2013 is excellent in combination with the touchscreen. When you get the laptop be sure to disable the on-screen keyboard in Windows, lest you want it to become a hassle when you are using the touchscreen to edit documents.  It seems as if this laptop isn't very well recognized, but it's had a profound effect on my productivity in the past months, so I figured I'd share my experience with those searching for a laptop.  I apologize for writing so much, I was going to post some stress tests and stuff but then I realized that I had already written a lot. I recommend this laptop, good luck in your search fellow citizens of Amazon.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00G8FH40K"}}
