{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very stable and fast... but dont you dare play a game!", "Author": "Alexander lee Howell", "ReviewID": "R1QRDI8VYKC7FM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just got this as a back to school computer.  Its been excellent and responsive in running all the MS Office programs and photo editing software I use.  But in your off hours, don't expect it to do much running any moderately recent games.  Despite impressive specs otherwise (considering the price) It has no video card.  You can run anything that runs in a window great, but don't expect to go full screen with World of Warcraft or anything.  Also, it sounds like it has one speaker... just one.... to the right.  If you might listen to music while you work, I recommend a set of desktop portable speakers.  I got the Razer ones myself and it works like a charm.Overall, great for work and school.  I'm happy.", "Date": "September 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great notebook w/ great options for the price.", "Author": "kewlkarz", "ReviewID": "R3JKR1J9JNL3ZV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I really have no complaints with this notebook. I am on my second one as the first one I had, had a dvd tray that wouldn't close. The second one I got works perfectly.It's very fast, video playback is smooth, sound quality is very good (as laptops go). Has plenty of memory to run a multitude of things in the background and then some. I haven't experienced any lag yet and I typically have multiple windows and programs running.The aesthetics of the notebook are amazing I love the swirled aluminum affect, it gives it a really nice solid feel and a cool touch.The keyboard is very nice, no wiggle in the keys that so many laptops have. Everything on the notebook feels very solid.Battery life is far above average I would say I get a solid 8 hours with moderate use, mostly internet surfing with a 30 min show or 2.Heat displacement hasn't been to bad my left leg gets a little warm sometimes but for the most part the notebook stays nice and cool.Screen is very bright and has very good contrast.The graphics are kind of weak if your expecting to play any major games off it. e.g. Battlefield, WoW, Homefront, etc...Have not used the built in WiDi yet but I can't wait to try it; awesome option to have! WiMax works great on 4G. The WiFi range is good overall will pick up from quite a distance.Overall I am very pleased with this notebook and would certainly recommend it to a friend. Previous reviews show some malfunction of hardware but sometimes bad things happen to good electronics. Don't let one or two bad reviews sway you from a really nice notebook.", "Date": "September 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Faltered  right out of the gate", "Author": "kphar", "ReviewID": "R32NNDZGYMBJ3A", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased mine almost one month ago.  Worked when I took it out of the box, but failed latter the next day after leaving on the charger overnight.  I removed the battery and held the power one button for several minutes to clear anything, reinstalled the battery and hooked up the AC adapter.  And it worked, until this past evening.  Same thing happen again.  Repeated the same steps and no results.  Called Asus and they indicated that it needs to be sent back to the factory in CA for repair.  So off it goes at my expense.The only complaint I have found with this model was the sound quality, which for me wasn't critical.  However, this power failure on POST is a major issue.  Will add more, once I get it back, hopefully within 30 days, which I find complete and totally unacceptable.Would I purchase this item again, probably not!", "Date": "August 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Beware: No longer a quality product", "Author": "andrew zatlin", "ReviewID": "RWR0VS454TA8W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "ASUS cut corners to deliver a low-price, light weight laptop.The hinges were flimsy and broke under normal opening and closing. The track pad buttons wore out fast.  And the speakers were really bad.Other than the backlit keyboard, the changes on the new models are basically attempts to fix these workmanship and construction problems.The problem is that when the machine breaks, it will not be covered under the standard warranty.  That's a big problem.  Because when it breaks down - and it will - whatever money you saved up front will be lost in repair fees.ASUS used to stand apart as a quality product at a reasonable price and with excellent warranty support.No longer.Now they are an average product at a decent price and with poor warranty service.If you are going to buy this, get an extended warranty that covers any form of breakage.  They will look for a loophole to not cover the device.Buyer beware", "Date": "July 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Laptop!!", "Author": "MV", "ReviewID": "RP6NH9V6PB5XC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You cant find a laptop with these specs for the price!! I did alot of research and ended up with Asus. The Asus U-46 has a metal finish giving it a very solid and durable feel. It is ultra thin and modern looking as well. This laptop is not for a serious gamer but perfect for your everyday business person or student. I call it the Mac of Pc's. PC Magazine gave this laptop great reviews also. I love it so far and very impressed with the quality.", "Date": "September 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "IMPOSSIBLE to get LCD replacement", "Author": "division by 0", "ReviewID": "R3DN6VF8C87G99", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Should you decide to purchase this laptop, pray that nothing happens to the LCD.It is impossible to find the replacement LCD, literally - not available from anywhere or anyone, including Asus.Consider yourself warned.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good buy", "Author": "rober58", "ReviewID": "R1IRZ9OHTMPO57", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent laptop for general use.

It has a great build except for two things: (1) The hinge is horrible. It is plastic and bound to break even with light use over time. This is an engineering defect as opposed to anything you might do to the laptop. This would be fine, but getting it replaced was hell and I would rather have gotten a cheaper laptop given what I ended up paying for it. Asus warranty department was NOT helpful. In fact, they wanted me to send the laptop in for $70 plus paying for my own shipping to diagnose the laptop and whether it would fall under warranty. This is the last time that I will be purchasing an Asus product. Look up Asus hinge problems and you will find a lot of stories.", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "returned after 1 day", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3IZ19EDUQBCKD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this locally for $700 and returned it in under 24 hours. While the design is nice and it seemed like a great deal, the display is awful. Initially I'd say it looked washed out. Reading or viewing anything with a white background was hard on the eyes.
