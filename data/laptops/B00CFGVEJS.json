I was very dissapointed and what is very important, I opened internet based resolution tests and it tells me 1580x860 than 1920x1080 (FULL HD)  It might be a problem of matrix. My 2008 model sony vaio is more crips in terms of the display than this one.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not the laptop I ordered (Order # 108-7332914-6849837)", "Author": "Armando Osuna", "ReviewID": "R24WT1C3MYSK02", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The Sony Vaio laptop I received is a lower spec model than the one I've ordered. My purchase was for the touch-screen model Sony Vaio SVF15212CXW and the laptop received was the Sony Vaio SVF152C29L, which is not touch-screen - one of the main features that drove my purchase.Unfortunately, I have been travelling and it was only now that I was able to check the laptop received. When I tried to return it I was notified that the time allowed for returns had expired, therefore was not allowed. Needless to say how disappointed I am, as the correct model should have been delivered in the first place.Now, I have a laptop which doesn't feature what I want and that cost me more than it should have as the laptop I received can be up to $xx cheaper than the one I did ordered.I would at least like to receive an online money certificate for the difference in price between the two models, but I don't see how to do this. Hope Amazon can help.Thanks.", "Date": "October 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "NOT A TOUCHSCREEN!!!", "Author": "Nino", "ReviewID": "R19C0ZQARFYBRC", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you are looking for an up to date laptop then this is the one, but read the product description carefully if you are looking for a touch screen laptop, because this one is not!!!", "Date": "December 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "I don' like Windows 8 screen layout IS DIFFICAULT but I like Windows 7 better!!
