{"Reviews": [{"Title": "1080P Screen Not So Great", "Author": "Saint04", "ReviewID": "R35805XNABO5XC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm not interested in writing a long and drawn out review of this product. I mainly just wanted to state that those who are interested in this system with the IPS screen may want to reconsider if light bleed concerns them. You will find that after doing some research on the internet, IPS screens are notorious for light bleed. I was hoping the new Alienware systems would be an acceptation considering all the rave from many official reviews I had read mentioning not to skimp on the screen upgrade. My screen had light bleed across the entire bottom, which overlapped with the right side, and I also had some in the the top left corner that nearly projected across the entire screen back down in to the lower right hand corner. Also, opening and closing the screen exaggerated the light-bleed very badly. My upper left corner did have very slight play/give in it, which may have contributed to the significant amount of light bleed that I experienced. I also did a Google search and found many forums with people purchasing these new IPS panels with horrible light bleed. You will mainly notice this in dark rooms on dark backgrounds such as games with dark scenes or watching movies with darker scenes. It will also be pronounced if you are in a dark room and the computer screen is booting up. I will be returning this system (Alienware 14 w/1080p screen) since I ended up buying the Alienware 17 with 1600 by 900 screen. It has the old school TN panel. While the TN panel may be lower resolution, I won't have to worry about any concerns with light bleeding. Just my thoughts that may be worth sharing. I may come back and write a much more thorough review if I feel inspired to do so. I can say that anyone interested in the new Alienware lineup will find that the build quality is top notch in contrast to nearly any other gaming system. They have set out to be the Apple build quality of gaming systems to put things into perspective.One other thing worth noting is that I did consider exchanging this system for the same one given the defects I had experienced. However, since I purchased my system through an outside party to Amazon who was prime eligible, Amazon could not do an even exchange.If you have any general questions about this system, I will do my best to respond.

The specs for the computer is NOT what I paid for! First, one the website, the product detail clearly states that the computer will come with Windows 8. However, when I turned on the computer, the operating system is Windows 7 instead. I was looking for laptops with Windows 8, not Windows 7! Despite the negative comments for Windows 8 on the internet, Windows 7 is 4 years old and it is not what I am looking for! If I knew it would come with Windows 7, I would NOT have purchased this computer.Second, on the technical details provided, it says the laptop will come with Nvidia GeForce GTX765M graphic card with 2048 MB graphic RAM. But inside the computer, a significant lower end model graphic card was installed. It came with Nvidia GT750M graphic card with only 1024 MB of graphic RAM! It is a significant downgrade! On the official website, the exact Alienware 14 inch model with EXACT configuration cost $1249.00. The price I paid, $1499, is mainly for the graphic card upgrade.This is my first time leaving a negative feedback. I am extremely upset for the $250 rip off!WORST OF ALL:The condition of the laptop was listed as New. However, I received a REFURBISHED laptop with the WRONG configuration! WORST sell of ALL!", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Little piece of great stylish laptop, but stupid touch pad light.", "Author": "Tim Vieillescazes", "ReviewID": "R2E2JTMBOEWWWQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "*** After 1 month, my AC Adapter stopped working. Gotta buy a new one.Before this laptop i had the Asus g73jw-3de laptop. I love my Asus in every way but i was looking for something more portable this time. If the Asus g46vw were refreshed (hardware) i would have bought it. Anyway, since they had the 3rd generation processors, 600 graphics card series, also a 720p screen, i decided to try the alienware (400 dollars more than the asus).So far i'm having a good experience with it. Its heavy, but as everyone should know, its a gaming laptop. It doesn't make lot of noise, and i didn't had any heating problems so far. It came really well packed, and everything is working. I think the V style of the asus is alot more comfortable while using the laptop, but its not something that would interfere in my rating. Another thing is that this laptop didn't came with blue-ray player... I don't know why laptop developers insist on not putting it directly from fabric or saving space and not putting the cd player at all. Anyway, over all, it has a great processor and graphic card, a full hd screen, a great customized color keyboard (the keyboard is great), for a price that i think its ok.One thing i cant understand, and is the reason i removed 1 star from the review. Well, i hate the touch pad light and their software DOESNT let me turn it off. It has a way to turn it off, it took me 1 hour to do it after checking some forums with people with the same problems, but because of alienware stupidity, bye bye 1 star.I hope they start making touch screen gaming laptops. I have a surface pro and windows 8 with touch screen is GREAT.Any questions, just ask.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "My son loves it", "Author": "Sherifa Ibrahim", "ReviewID": "R2GNALG1L0IWYQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this for my 12-year-old and he was obsessed with it for a long time.He was happily surprised and absolutely lives it.", "Date": "November 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice Packaging", "Author": "Nelson O.
