This my first laptop and very happy with Gatweway NV5921u! Fast,quiet and very cool running! The blue cover looks awesome with the alligator motif! The touchpad has the multi-gesture feature! I have to get used to it but neat feature! The blu-ray player is nice feature and will output to HDTV. Time will tell how she holds up but I think this baby will keep on rockin!The only downside might be battery life--about 3 hours-but that is about average I understand.--the blu-ray player really sucks the power BTW! Did I mention how \"Light\" she is! Way more portable than a 17 inch laptop! The 15 inch screen might be smallish compared to a 17 incher but fine for me! A Webcam is included as well.

The best feature, in my opinion, is the BluRay Drive, and the HD resolution. When I viewed my first BluRay disc I could see the pimples on peoples faces, thats how clear it is. The only thing that I have had trouble with is the mouse pad, it kinda has a mind of its own now and then, its kinda hard to describe so I will show you what happens..... I hopeweather is nice the.... It kinda skips now and then, it gets frustrating especially when you notice it after you typed everything you need too and then have to retype. I just use the button that \"freezes\" the mouse pad, and use a regular mouse. Other then that this computer is a gem, its fast, and there is plenty of room. More then enough room. It is good for a gamer or just to use as a business computer. The battery life is kinda low, but thats never a problem for me as I keep this plugged in most of the time. I think the life is just over 4 hours. That can be fixed by buying a battery that lasts longer or changing your battery settings. Among the many other things I love about this computer, I especially like that its lite, easy to carry around and doesnt weigh you down.... With that said, to sum it all up I absolutly love this computer and wouldnt trade it for anything!!!!", "Date": "March 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "AK_Chicago", "Author": "AK_Chicago", "ReviewID": "R2XLAGB33LQXKG", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this primarily for Blu-Ray player, to occasionally hook up to HD TV in family room / bedroom, and not needing to invest in multiple BD players. Generally good machine but found out couple of annoying things with the blu-ray player. This comes with Power DVD8.. specifically when playing blu-ray DVDs (1) The output can go to EITHER built-in screen or the TV but not both simultaneously and (2) the mouse does not work to control/select (menu items etc), it has to be keyboard with arrows/enter keys, like in DOS days!So I contacted gateway (thru the customer service \"chat\"), who, after \"registration\" info and rest of my life history tell me that they do not support \"third party\" things (like this Power DVD) and only hardware + OS. But here is the kicker, they will be happy if I called \"answers by gateway\" where the charge meter will start one minute into call.So machine is ok (even good, but there are many out there) just the customer service and the main thing I wanted (blu-ray player) to work reasonably well, sucks. I should have done more research and stuck to more 'standard' brands, in hindsight, learning you get what you pay for.", "Date": "February 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "I am returning this laptop", "Author": "Kimberly J Mitchell", "ReviewID": "RKOM73NEUHYYK", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "First the good stuff:  Like the looks, and the size and the video display.  Am returning due to the touchpad.  I have tried to adjust it but it seems to have a mind of its own!  It is not responsive to what I am doing, and I find that incredibly annoying and unproductive.  Am willing to concede that it may be operator error, but I have been using it for a few weeks now, and the mouse pointer just jumps all over the place, even when I am not even touching the computer.  Windows open that I don't want to open.  I get so annoyed using this computer that it is just not worth the hassle.  I don't want to \"settle\" - I have ordered a different computer and we will see how that one stacks up.  I had the rest of my family try it too and they were equally annoyed.", "Date": "June 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Outstanding Computer!! Thanks Amazon and Gateway", "Author": "Don Vito Corleone \"The Joker\"", "ReviewID": "R2YXU9Y4B7T7R3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wanted a laptop for a long time. I did not have a lot of money but I wanted one with Windows 7, Intel core i3 and a Bluray player. Of course it wasn't to be cheap, but I did not want to pay a lot either. I started seeing laptops (sony, toshiba) but they were really expensive when I noticed this Gateway. I thought it was too good to be true. It had all the features I wanted plus more and at a very reasonably price. I've never heard of Gateway before so I hve my doubts into buying this one. Finally, after doing a lot of research and viewing customer reviews, I took the risk and boiught it. So far, it has been a fantastic purchase, only time will tell. Its design is very cool and the bluray looks stunning, is very fast and I can do everything in it. A fantastic laptop. The battery does not last long but it's not a problem to me. If you want a cheap laptop with many excellent features, this Gateway it's the best way to go.", "Date": "June 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great purchase", "Author": "Terrie L.

I still use a 2001 Gateway Desktop, but this isn't an old, reliable Gateway.  It's parts in a box that don't match.  I  bought this computer earlier this year (2010) and have nothing but trouble with it.  I submitted a negative review at Gateway's site and they did not post it!!!DO NOT BUY THIS COMPUTER.  I can't recommend another unit, but I wasted over $700 on this junk and I don't want to see YOU do the same.", "Date": "September 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Beware Gateway", "Author": "Jen \"EmtJenC\"", "ReviewID": "R2JY0A6ITKW93E", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Awful customer service! I purchased a smilar model (They no longer make the model I have) Gateway laptop last August for school. I was wooed by the nifty backlit keyboard and the wide screen. I was happy with it for a few minutes, then I looked at the bottom of the laptop and realized it had a build date of January 2009, my computer was already 7 months old. After a few weeks of back and forth to class, the case started to loosen around the screen. After about two months, the keyboard started to warp and the keys began to crack. After threee months, it crashed for the first time. the customer service was horrible and the first thing they wanted me to do was purchase a restore CD. After talking to a few more techs, one revealed that I didn't need the disk, the information was in a partitioned-off part of the hard drive. It crashed again a month later and I went through the same thing, they tried to sell me the disk then when I told them I knew I could restore it without the disk, they again walked me through that. the final straw was in my 6th month of ownership when I spilled orange juice in the keyboard and fried the motherboard. I entered customer service hell. They, AGAIN, tried to sell me a restore disk even though I told them it was partially booting up. Finally I set the computer up to be sent to their Temple, TX repair center. I had to give my credit card info via IM with a tech support agent. He gave me the instructions for packaging it, but neglected to tell me there was an e-mail with more instructions. I had sent off my computer with the original box and the power cord, both of which they said they wouldn't return DESPITE the fact that the instructions were in an e-mail I got after I mailed it. I finally convinced them to send the unrepaired laptop back to me, I'm going to toss it in the Wabash river and buy an Asus.", "Date": "February 28, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2.13GHz Intel Core i3-330M Processor with Intel Hyper-Threading Technology\n4GB DDR3 1066MHz Memory\n500GB 5400RPM SATA Hard Drive, 4X Blu-ray Disc/DVD-Super Multi Double-layer Drive\n15.6\" HD Widescreen Ultrabright LED-backlit Display; Intel Graphics Media Accelerator HD\nWindows 7 Home Premium; Up to 4 Hours 30 Minutes of Battery Life", "Name": "Gateway NV5915u 15.6-Inch Laptop (NightSky Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41BcIlp%2BkpL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0031RG0SU"}}
