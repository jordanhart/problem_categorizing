First to be said is getting it up and running which took less than 15 minutes to do and not one error which was a great start. The Touchscreen was the best part of this laptop. Easy to use you get a keyboard on the Touchscreen that as you type along makes suggestions and corrects errors which I love. Also on the normal keyboard when it gets too dark in the room the keyboard lights up automatically which is real nice. I do most of my laptop work at night. Easy to use restart button also the brightness feature sets the laptop to the perfect light tone you want at anytime.The laptop is a little heavier than I expected it to be, my last one is lighter, but it is still very comfortable especially when I use in bed which is most of the time.If you are planning getting your first laptop or a replacement I would suggest to definitely get the Touchscreen. It costs a little more but it is so worth it.Sony products are the best!", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "VAIO Wow-O", "Author": "Joel L.

So, for the first time in over a year, she is getting a laptop. Or now, has done got. And it was an easier transition than I'd expect. Given that it is touch screen, there is no awkward pause before deciding to use the keyboard on the screen.She writes,\"This laptop serves its purpose well. The size is great, its not too heavy or awkward. You can easily switch between using the touch screen and the keyboard. Using the touch screen does take some getting used to but I don\u2019t find myself using that feature as much as I thought I would. The touchpad on the keyboard is too sensitive for me. I will be using it to scroll and it will randomly starting shrinking or enlarging my screen. I just reach up and pinch the screen back to where I like but this can be frustrating. About three weeks after we got it I found a tiny screw on my dining room table. After searching around I realized it came out of the bottom of this laptop. I put it back in with no problem but found that all of the other screws were loose as well. The apps available are aplenty.\"Returning to me now,In my experience, the Sony VAIO is the machine for Windows 8.1 I am not impressed with Windows 8, but now I see it has more to do with the machine than it does the program itself. Yes, it will take some getting used to, but over all, Windows 8 is going to serve a high functionality purpose.It runs fast and after a month of use, doesn't seem to have bogged itself down. One of things I've noticed with other machines is the heat it gives off. With the Sony, it doesn't. I cannot detect much of a heat transference, so it will not burn my naked thighs.So, what exactly are you looking for when getting a new pc laptop?Runs fast? Check.Hardware where it needs to be? Yup and yup. I run a pretty heavy software system and this one handled with pretty wellOffice runs okay? Yup.Dvds? Yup.It writes cd/dvds as well and rather quickly.As she said, the only real complete, shell wise, are the screws. One fell out, and the others were loose.As one who knows PC, now prefers Mac, this is has tempted me... tempted by the fruit of another.", "Date": "March 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sony does NOT care", "Author": "joeyd2099", "ReviewID": "R2A85R8VDN6WKL", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This rating is not solely a refection of the laptop, but heavily influenced by my experience with Sony and this item.I bought this laptop on Amazon from Datavision which was probably my first mistake.  It was not until after purchasing the laptop that I read some unfortunate experiences customers had with attempting to return or exchange items to Datavision.  Within a couple days of having the laptop, I noticed that the spacebar did not feel right when I tried to type fluidly.  (I type at least at an average speed).  The end furthest from the screen appeared to have resistance and did not go down far at all.  It felt as if there was gum or something underneath.  Its hard to describe, but I have never come across a keyboard or laptop that had a spacebar messing me up as I'm typing.  If you are trying to type quickly, and you do not have the clear feeling that the spacebar was pushed down, you might be able to understand how that can mess you up while typing.After reading about Datavision's exchange policy and customer reviews saying that after waiting 30 days, they got the same defective product back being told it was fine or it was the fault of the customer, I decided to contact Sony to repair it.  I really did want this laptop, and I figured, \"Ok, I'll send it to Sony and they can make sure it is in tip-top shape\". WRONG!  From the time I sent it to sony to getting it back, it took about 2-3 weeks.  Supposedly whatever part they needed to repair it at the facility was on backorder, which was fine.After I get my laptop back, I check out the spacebar, and I am dissatisfied to say the least.  Now, it did seem different.  The whole thing went down easier, but too easy on the end closest to the screen now.  Again, you hardly get any indication that you even pushed down a button.  And then after using it for a couple hours, the end furthest from the screen seemed to get worse with that \"gumy\" feeling AGAIN!  Perhaps another way of describing it is spongy when pushing it.I would also like to mention that I went to a store that had the same exact laptop.  And guess what, the spacebar worked the same as every other laptop in there.  Yes, I walked around tapping on all the spacebars.So I called technical support again, I tried to kindly and thoroughly explain the whole situation and my dissatisfaction.  And when I was done, his only solution was for me to send it back to the repair facility.  I'll let you use your imagination to fill in how angry I was.  I eventually agreed to sending it to them again.  He also said that if I get it back with an issue again, then an option may be to replace it with a new one.  I honestly have doubts about that happening.Now here I am the next day, realizing how ridiculous and absurd it is to send an item for a repair, getting it back not repaired, then being told the only option is to send it back to the place that did not repair it to repair it.  So I called again and asked support to put me through to customer relations.  Again, I was met with the only thing they can do for me is sending it back to them.  She said this to me several times, and each time it just made me outraged even more.  She eventually agreed to let me speek to someone higher up, but I was met with the same \"solution\".  She also told me that the repair facility had replaced the keyboard.  As much as I would like to believe that, other things I have read regarding Sony make me doubt this as well.I also called the repair facility.  The man I spoke to could only tell me that the keyboard was replaced and that I should send it back in.  When I asked him if it was not fixed the first time, what assurance is there that it can be fixed, he responded with telling me a technician will look at it.  Why is it that even the repair facility cannot directly answer my questions?On another note, this model has had issues with the wireless cutting out.  I was aware of this and still went ahead with purchasing it. That's how much I wanted this laptop.  Based on other reviews, I was convinced that Sony could modify some settings to correct the issue.  This was done for me, but I have not had enough time with it to ensure it has stopped sporadically losing signal.Although I was aware of the wireless issue, it should be pointed out that Sony was very aware of this in the Vaio.  At least from what I've gathered reading forums, this was an issue about a year ago and it seems they were willing to put the 4th generation Intel chips in a device with a problematic wireless card.  If I am wrong about this, someone feel free to correct me.  Again, this is my understanding from what I've read.Aside from this stupid spacebar issue, and a weak wireless, I really do like the laptop.  I know having a cd/dvd drive is not really necessary anymore, and most laptops no longer have them, but this is something I wanted and that the Vaio Fit has.  It has all the ports I would want, including SD card and HDMI port.  I will say that the zoom feature on the touchpad can be sensitive and finicky.  What I have done is disabled that feature, and then I just use the touch screen if i need to zoom in our out.  Honestly I really like the look and feel of the laptop.  Given how much I do like that laptop, its unfortunate that something so benign cannot be corrected.Dear Sony,Is it too much to ask for a laptop that is in new working condition? After all, that is what I paid for.  And, could I get that laptop without being forced to jump through hoops.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I am the customer.  And I am telling you I am dissatisfied.  And having me do the same thing which did not work the first time around does not instill much confidence in me as a consumer.  Also, it is quite infuriating when after no real solution is made, your representatives ask me if I would like to extend my warranty.  I understand that they are just doing their job, but perhaps you should incorporate some common sense into your employee training.  It is quite simple actually.  When a customer is mad and unhappy with their BRAND NEW PRODUCT, DON'T ASK IF THEY WANT TO PAY MORE MONEY TO EXTEND THE WARRANTY!Sincerely,Unhappy CustomerP.S.  If I knew this was going to happen, I would have definitely stuck with Lenovo.  My good old Lenovo Thinkpad is 7 years old, still works, and had a very generous 3 year warranty.  That is 2 more years than your 1 year warranty.  And of course nothing is perfect, and I sent it in for repairs a couple times, but I certainly never had it returned with the same issue.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great computer, did take a while to get used to, and the mouse zoom function is a bit of a pain.", "Author": "Jason P.

I don't live close to any large electronic stores, so I bought this at a Fry's in LA when on a trip there. After getting it home and opening the box, I found that it was missing part of the power cord. It has the power supply part that connects to the computer, but the polarized end that connects to the wall was missing. I called Sony twice to see if they could send it to me since they were the ones that left it out of the package to begin with, but they said I had to take it back to the store (which I am 800 miles away from now). The store won't ship one to me. I have to bring the computer and receipt in. So to save further headaches, I just ordered one from Amazon. It's such a cheap part, I can't believe Sony would refuse to send it to me. So I have to give a thumbs down to Sony's customer service.On to the computer, I really liked it in the store, but now that I've had a chance to spend more time on it, I'm less than impressed. I am really annoyed by the touchpad. I can't decide if it is overly sensitive or not sensitive enough, but basically it is a pain to navigate with. As others have mentioned, it is constantly zooming out and the cursor skipping all over the screen. The keyboard feels pretty good. I was looking for a good mix between an ultrabook and a laptop, and I think this fits the bill as far as size and memory. I like that it has a dvd drive/burner. I wish it were a little lighter. It weighs about the same, maybe even a little more than my larger dell laptop. The touch screen is a cool feature. What I'm the most disappointed in is the speed. Maybe I received a lemon, but it takes forever to \"think.\" I expected a much quicker start-up and faster processing as I navigate online, but so far it is less than ideal. The browser has crashed on me a couple of times too. Maybe this is a Windows thing and not the hardware, but for this price I expected something less buggy.", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "cheap plastic feel build quality.", "Author": "Justin Lee", "ReviewID": "R1VGVJPVMTVCRX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Plastic feel build quality disappoints.

I've been using it for several weeks and really love it.  The touch screen is really helpful.  If you haven't used touch screen technology before it may take a bit of time to understand how to use it, or how to revert to keyboard mode.  You can toggle between using the keyboard or the touch screen so this gives you the choice to use it with touch, or more as a traditional keyboard driven laptop.  Not having used touch screen anything before, I was able to learn these functions pretty easily, so I would say it is very user friendly.  It comes with a few nice software installations, such as a stripped down version of photoshop which is nice.  I was disappointed it doesn't contain windows, but I guess that is standard for most new computers.  The keybaord has a nice feel and mouse functions really well.  The computer has TONS of memory which is great in a laptop.  This does make it heavier than an ultra book however.  Unlike ultrabooks it also contains a slot for DVDS which can be helpful, although its a dieing technology.  The laptop is pretty thin though.  The screen looks GREAT.  I'm very pleased with the display, color, and clarity of the screen.  Start up is VERY fast which is great.All in all, I love this laptop and would recommend it to anyone looking for a laptop with great memory capacity.", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$829.99", "Features": "Intel Core i5-4200U 1.6 GHz\n6 GB DDR3L SDRAM\n750 GB 5400 rpm Hard Drive\n14-Inch Screen", "Name": "Sony VAIO SVF14325CXB 14-Inch Touchscreen i5 Laptop", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dzxyGrdxL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00HG6W6A8"}}
