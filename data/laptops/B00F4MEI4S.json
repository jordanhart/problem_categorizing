{"Reviews": [{"Title": "DELL Inspiron 15R", "Author": "lee jumbelic", "ReviewID": "R2HL8HE82UJR1U", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "window's 8 sucks, had to download classic shell to make it tolerable.  Overall this machine is no faster than my old ACER despite 2x the RAM and i5 processor.  Also thought I was getting a touch screen which this isn't but that's my own fault for not reading the description closely ( after reading so many others on other choices)  but that's O.K.  Cannot find NUM LOCK in the Bios to turn on either so must do it manually each time I boot. One last annoyance is the right click key on the finger / thumb pad is LOUD.  Nothing wrong with this computer overall but I'd expected it to be better than the one I replaced.", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "awesome fix", "Author": "rising*sun", "ReviewID": "R2I1Z9Q5HS3FK9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This screen was very easy to install and it saved us from having to replace the laptop.

Sturdy in construction and good performance. Though knew it before buying, the only low performers are the screen resolution, OS (Win8) and not quite sure how good is the battery. Windows8 is optimized for touch screen but this is a non touch one, some times annoying with the screen gestures.", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "good  laptop. liked it", "Author": "Venkat", "ReviewID": "R2IN5NS5CUOFTZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "big enough (Actually  screen is much bigger than what i thought it would be )keys area bit small .. having them bit bigger would have helped easier typing", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great Purchase!", "Author": "Mac87", "ReviewID": "R1K9A3YL79KAKR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The computer arrived in a timely fashion, which was quite nice.

The wifi has a strong connection and the computer functions very quickly.  Our only complaint which is why we rated it 4 and not 5 stars is because the edge of the computer case is sharp and it scratches my wife's wrist while she is typing.", "Date": "April 29, 2014"}, {"Title": "Laptop", "Author": "Suzette P.", "ReviewID": "R1PAQABPSOFALO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm completely happy with this Laptop.
