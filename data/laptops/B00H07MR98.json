{"Reviews": [{"Title": "An ALMOST perfect ultrabook.", "Author": "Manish Bhatia", "ReviewID": "R1FBKM1FD8JM3X", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very few computers are perfect. My Haswell MacBook Air was almost perfect with 10+ hours of battery but then the 1440 screen got kind of old pretty quick. While not a bad display it just was not retina worthy. I tried the 1st Gen Retina 13 but it did not have the battery I needed plus the weight and smaller form factor made it a little weird for extended use. I have been using different forms for MacBook Airs and Pros over the last several years and ipads of all types so switching to a Windows machine was a MAJOR change for me but I am enjoying the ride so far.First I actually am using the computer MORE than I even used the Mac since Windows is everywhere and all sorts of apps and settings are easily at hand to play with. I was really using the MacBook Air primarily as an extended ipad for browsing, photo editing and management and other \"consumption\" stuff rather than \"creation\" stuff.Anyways after trying MANY laptops and PRICE being an important factor, I ended up with this laptop from Best Buy at a $899 price (0ff $100 of the $999. Some have mentioned getting it at a $799 price point and it is a STEAL for that price!)Here are the things I like about it -1) The 1920x1080 display is a must instead of the standard crappy 1366x768 laptop screens. It is almost retina worthy and you will love oohing and ahhing over the glorious graphics, news articles in bright lighting and so on.2) It has the Wireless AC version which is future ready3) It is somewhat upgradeable with one free RAM slot and a SSD capability if needed. ( I am ok with the hybrid drive)4) The Hybrid drive makes you miss the SSD less than a conventional drive since it is zippier and gives you MUCH more storage than the standard 128 GB SSD drive laptops5) There are abundance of ports - full HDMI , display PORT, 3 USB 3.0 ports including sleep charge.6) The keyboard is wonderful. I am using it now and it is fine for typing. It is also BACKLIT with user controllable dimming7) The main thing for my MacBook Air was my trackpad and that was the ONE thing besides battery I was leery about and this one has been wonderful almost at par with the AIR...which is saying something.8) The multiple windows snap feature of Windows 8 is awesome and makes me get over missing the multiple desktop screens of the Mac with quick swipe between them9) Bluetooth has worked awesome so far with my old MS Bluetooth Mouse.10) The design is perfect as well although I am not as thrilled about the glossy blue as it is being advertises. I would have probably gone for the white one if it was a store item instead of online only.11) It includes bonus items like the USB -LAN adapter, the Mini Display - VGA adapter and a decent sleeve case12) The WIFI signal has been great so far with no drops.13) It runs quiet and cool pretty much all the timeCONSThere are not many but the main one is that the battery is still not an all day one like the Air used to be. But like I said earlier, I am actually using the laptop a lot more now because of the pretty screen and all the different programs I never thought of using with the Air for making greeting cards, touch screen apps etc.The battery in my usage for basic web browsing and minor media playback on 60% or so brightness (very useable) is a good 5+ hours so its actually pretty good but just seems bad compared to the Air. It charges fully in a couple of hours and the adapter is like the Apple one with a wall plug and a long wire.I would have liked the $799 price point to be a no brainer purchase because I am cheap like that and I like to get stuff at a price point of a year down the road for the next upgrade. I sold my Mac Air for a net of  $1100 on Amazon and it retained the value wonderfully and I am not completely confident about Windows machines for resale although this has future ready specs for wifi and screen resolution.BUT....HERE IS THE NUMBER 1 REASON this laptop made the cut out of the other ones the longest so far (I still have a few days left for return but I will probably keep it since I have loaded all sorts of stuff on it now to stress test it)IT FEELS AND LOOKS JUST LIKE MY MACBOOK AIR!!  It is basically a more tanned clone of the Air with the Aluminium finish, large trackpad and great keyboard in a wedge shape (slightly deeper in the bottom if you look closely). If Apple ever had a good lawsuit for design infringement this would be the one to go after...lolSo in the end I got close to the design, finish and hardware usability of my beloved AIR (minus the battery life) and the useability of a full Windows ecosystem with the Apps/desktop fun/work type flip flop experience to keep things fresh. Plus I was able to use a bunch of old CD software lying around. In return for 3-4 hours less of the battery life I am getting a touchscreen, twice the HD space and a universal OS.All in all, I am satisfied. You get a lot for the money especially the screen which really makes it comparable in size and useability closer to the Retina Pro 13 than the Air.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Overall: Great Machine for A Road Warrior for work or play - or on your desk or lap.", "Author": "Jawpar", "ReviewID": "R2WTKMBK0CEJWY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great machine for work or play at home or while traveling.  ASUS hit the mark by providing a powerful, sturdy, light weight, stylish ultra book at a reasonable price point, missing on only a few minor points.  I greatly prefer to purchase big ticket electronics via Amazon, but reluctantly purchased at Best Buy on line at a price significantly less than offered by any Amazon vendor.I needed to upgrade my work computer, and after much research determined that for me a touchscreen laptop rather than a 2-in-1 which would have required compromises in power, cost and upgrade-ability - bear in mind that I do also have a ASUS tablet (with a keyboard) which I use as a reader and internet surfer and often schlep on short trips with or without the keyboard. I suspect that I will use the UX302la even for these purposes everywhere except the beach or hiking.  So without further adieu:The Hits:1. This machine is sleek and inviting even sitting in the black presentation box in which it arrived.  The beautiful indigo/midnight blue Gorilla glass top is stylish and different, and opening the display reveals the extraordinary thin line of the display. The ASUS logo on the case lights up when the computer is on - very cool presentation!  The finely sculpted lines of the keyboard are sleek and seamless, and the whole machine looks like an advanced visitor from the future.2. The build of the zen book is flawless and solid - the display is elegantly thin and feels very solid, and the front and sides of the keyboard and guts base are fashioned from a single piece of extruded aluminum with a secure aluminum back panel seamlessly attached by nine Torx T5 screws and two other screws (located under the back rubber feet).3. The zen book is among the lightest 13.3 inch display ultra books, weighing in at just over 3 pounds: Lifting the computer from the box, one can easily can grip and lift the unit with one hand, yet the ultra book has enough mass and size to be stable on a table or lap.4. Essential upgrades allowed: The computer literate owner can upgrade ram (I am adding 8GB at present) and hard drive (perhaps a nice 1TB SSD) at home.  This capacity is more than essential for those who run serious local applications (e.g., Open Office) and store large amounts of data (e.g., movies and images) sometimes without constant Internet access to function! A word to the wise: you need DDR3L (\u201cL\u201d for low power) memory - see the specs at the ASUS web site - the UX302LA will not register regular DDR3 memory.5. A complete picture of the UX302LA: for a nicely organized and presented video review with a good look at what is under the hood, go to the following link:[...]There are You Tube videos illustrating how to perform both RAM and hard drive upgrades.6. The Power block and connector cord are small and light, and monitor and network connectors arrive in their own travel folio.  The machine fully recharges in an hour or two and battery life so far exceeds six hours (with some intelligent power management).7. Road Warrior: This machine is truly designed for the road. I could see packing the zen book in a folio, the  power brick and connectors in a small case and both in a carry-on overnight suitcase or a brief case - and traveling without a separate computer bag.  Of course, this assumes that the user can work without a DVD drive - in the age of downloadable software, huge thumb drives and on demand storage, this should rarely be an issue.8. The back-lit, chiclet style keyboard has a great tactile feel. Surprise:  spacing of the typing keys is generous - I am used to 92% of full size QUERTY keyboard in my old Asus U30A - this new zen book has full sized typewriter keys with what feels like full spacing, so typing in text is pretty easy.  Numerical keyboard is among the casualties of small footprint design. I originally wondered about having to use the FN key to access Home, End, PgDn, PgUp - but has not hindered me - with the touch screen and a great touch pad mouse, this is not much of an issue anyway.  The only improvement on the back-lighting is that it seems to be either on or off - at least I have not found a dimmer control or a way to set the brightness.9. Battery life: I charged the zen book and removed the juice when the LED on the tip of the charger connector turned green.  Six hours later, I still had 35% battery (enough for another 1.7 hours), after watching a TV show, installing a million Windows updates, updating to Windows 8.1, installing Norton Security Suite, Open Office, Firefox, Speccy and a host of other staple applications and utility programs. The low voltage Haswell processor and low voltage memory support better battery performance.10. Hard Drive performance and Freedom from the Cloud.  As one who does not buy into the idea of blithely storing applications and private information in the \"Cloud\" (euphemism for leaky Internet accessed servers), I like the idea of a large (500 GB is standard on this zen book) drive to hold both applications and data, my entire music collection, thousands of pics and a virtual library of books.  I have seen no practical slowdown in performance from accessing the \u201cslow\u201d 5400 RPM drive - probably due to the SSD used as a cache.11. Instant On and shutdown are great.  The SSD that makes all this possible is a Sandisk 24GB drive used as a cache.  When I install my 480 GB SSD in place of the mechanical hard drive, this machine should really fly and power draw should decrease.12. The full HD gorilla glass Screen is terrific - 13.3 inches is the max for a road warrior who works and chills on planes and trains and in hotel rooms, and the only reason I can think of to go larger on screen size is to run more than one application side by side - you can port to an external monitor for this purpose.13. Haswell Processor rocks.  The i5 has plenty of speed and power for most applications short of fanatical gaming, and the low voltage contributes to good overall performance on battery.14. Easy to Access Functions and Opportunities to Extend performance on battery.  One can set the display brightness to 50% using the FN key and the icon identified function keys on the keyboard. The user can reduce the voltage draw of the Haswell processor and other elements, also conserving battery power.15. Bluetooth, Widi and Wifi.  It\u2019s all there, although you will have to download and install Intel\u2019s latest driver and software, when you upgrade to Windows 8.1.  Bluetooth is seamless, and the Wifi connection was strong, even upstairs, fifty more feet away from our wireless \u201cN\u201d router and through on around Rock-lathe (concrete and steel mesh) walls and ceilings - With Widi ready Wireless AC, this machine is ready to connect for the foreseeable future.  No problem connecting via bluetooth to my smart phone, headset or another computer.15. Fifty ways to enter data: Touchscreen and touch pad are both excellent, and this zen book comes with Nuance Dragon Assistant, a basic voice recognition and command system installed. The Assistant is rudimentary - OK for some voice controls but \"entry level\" voice recognition and not the equal of Nuance\u2019s other products.  Dictation in any application is possible, but clumsy, in that the user must hold down the Ctrl button while dictating and the results appear only after the user releases the button.  I have installed Nuance\u2019s Dragon Naturally Speaking, which truly allows dictation and virtually complete voice control (at the cost of giving up a line at the top of the screen).THE MISSES:All of the misses are minor annoyances, which do not materially affect my positive assessment of the UX302LA.1. Asus provides a thin man-made fiber covered folio slip case with a magnetic closure with the zen book. Kudos for the extra effort trying to eliminate the need for one accessory, but the portfolio case is virtually useless. The case has an effective magnetic closure, but the fabric is simply too slippery to grip securely - carrying the computer in the case, I can envision myself dropping the whole enchilada in any moment of the slightest inattention.  There is no pocket for the power block and connectors. Not wishing to test the shock absorbing properties of the zen book, I would 86 that case instantly in favor of an MU leather portfolio case with some texture and grip and a place to store a stylus - got one at a cost of less than $20, and also have some grip tape which I will try with the case ASUS supplied.2. Updating to Windows 8.1 is a minor hassle, but the new version is a big improvement over Windows 8.0.  Asus ought to provide a seamless Windows 8.1 update installation at this point, without requiring the user to install about 100 updates to Windows 8.0 (takes over an hour with repeated reboots if you don't find the Update function in Control Panel) before the 8.1 update even appears in the \u201cStore\u201d application.  And even once it appears in the Windows store, the user cannot install it like an \u201cApp\u201d - rather one still has to go through Windows update function in the control panel to actually download and install 8.1.  But it is easy to use your knowledge of past Windows versions and to display the familiar desktop, if you find the new \u201capplications\u201d based interface clumsy or hokey - and you can easily toggle between the two interfaces by pressing shift plus the Windows key.3. My biggest gripe:  The Power on/off button is located within the keyboard in the top right corner - where the \u201cDelete\u201d key has traditionally been placed - rather than separated from the keyboard.  More than a minor annoyance to turn off the computer when you just wanted to delete a typo from a document!!  Although this error just puts you in sleep mode, you likely will not lose your work, and instant on will get you back on course quickly, still an irritant.", "Date": "February 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "An isolated \"LEMON\" no more.", "Author": "Jarbas MacIel \"jerrymac\"", "ReviewID": "RP6ZXAH7IKUE1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got my Asus at Best Buy 28 of December 2013 as well but reading from the three users' reviews on this unit, I GOT A \"LEMON\"...nothing but problems from day one. The laptop constantly \"runs into a problem and needs to restart\". I couldn't work on it for half an hour before each 20 minutes interruption and lost all my changes I had done.  I am typing this review as fast as I can before it does it again.  After contacting Asus support three times and getting three \"case numbers\", they instructed me to do a complete re-formatting due to the computer refusing to start at all, frozen. Needless to say, all the programs including Kaspersky anti-virus, Office, etc was lost.  I will try once more to resolve with Asus but my it seems I am running out of patience.For now, I am labeling it an isolated \"lemon\".Jan 24 2014- After the first round of shut-downs, I imagine Windows had a chance to massage it and correct it to an extent. The shut-downs aren't as close together as before, but occosional. It seems I only ranted on negative points of this computer before in frustration. There are some very good points to recognize: The screen resolution is owsome, sound one of the best I've heard, fast, lit keybord very helpfull. Overall its a good laptop.1-31-14 -By now I expected that Windows or Asus had had a chance to analyze the \"shut-down\" problem with this laptop, but now the occurrences are happening while the unit is \"asleep\". When I wake it, the shut-down message is there saying it did shut down, do I want to send notification to Windows?I send it all the time, never see any outcome.2-1-14 - Here are more wonderful news on this Asus: today I am unable to connect to network, tried even setting up a new network connection, this desktop I am writing on has perfect connection as well as my Samsung laptop. I did a shut-down three times, no cigar. Dont know if the the network card is toast. I am right now performing a system restore and hope it works.2-10-14 Status quo on the constantly shutting down.  Microsoft research revealed as a \"page fault on a non-paged area\" and it stems from faulty hardware originally installed. I contacted Asus for a replacement and their response:  we'll only replace the unit if its unrepairable!!!3-7-14 Sent the unit to Asus on Feb 25 (at my cost $23.00). Communication was very poor as they have my email and phone, but never a word of status on the repairs. Yesterday I called to find out that they already have sent it back to me Fedex, hopefully arriving today. They were very curteous dealing with me. I called and asked tha rep on what steps was taken to correct the \"page fault\" error and she said they re-set the operating system to factory condition. I will reserve any further comments until I get to test the laptop.3-16-14 Got my Asus back 5 days ago. The only day that I could extensively test it was yesterday for about 5 hours non-stop. It hasnt turned off yetdue to \"page fault\". It looks like Asus did a good job on re-setting the OS. The initial bitter taste is dissipating. When the laptop is performing well, this is a very good machine, rich sound, graphics and fast. Its finally proving to possess the qualities for which I bought it and its now fulfilling my expectations.
