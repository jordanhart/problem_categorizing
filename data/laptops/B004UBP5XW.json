I had purchased a cheaper HP model with windows 8 on it and touch screen. I returned it because  i did not like the feel of the keyboard and the mouse.I could not find a nice laptop with  decent keyboard in stores so I took a risk  and ordered thinkpad t420s.The good:I5 processor ( my model has 8 gb ram and both integrated and dedicated graphics)14'' inch screen, not too big and not too smalllightweight, feels less than 4 lbs ( not as heavy and bulky as thinkpad 420)nice and comfortable keyboard -not shallow( this is the last model before they introduced chiclet keyboard )silent fandoes not overheatdecent performancestrong hingesfeels solidthinkpad light is useful in low lightdvd drive very responsiveeasily upgradableUSB 3 portadditional keysspill resistant keyboardyou can close the lid of the laptopremovable batteryThe bad:the mouse - I do not like its texture and no ability to scroll they way I could on my old laptopthe speakers are ok but my old hp and newer hp laptops both have much louder speakers, about 30% loudermicrophone ok , could be betterno backlit keyboardno touchscreenthe screen could have better contrast.battery life is not very long,  2 hours on averageI recommend this computer if you need  comfortable keyboard , light weight and do not need the newest and the greatest. This computer feels more solid in my hands than the new computers in stores and I would choose it over Macbook computers as well. I hope my thinkpad t420s will work well for many years .", "Date": "March 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "A great second-gen Core i5 machine", "Author": "Mel Beckman", "ReviewID": "R17HM8AIXE9Y3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Intel's Core i5 processor is a terrific platform for any notebook, but I love what Lenovo has done with the second-gen Sandy Bridge i5 in the T420s. Even though this model has been discontinued by Lenovo (it was an early 2011 release), it's better in many ways than the follow-on T430s, with longer battery life (seven hours, realistically, with a drive-bay battery) and a much nicer keyboard. In fact, it's the nicest keyboard I've ever experienced in 30 years of IT work. I looked at a T430s, the replacement model, but decided on a T420s with a 120G SSD. The i5 really takes advantage of the SSD's speed!If you've used the T420, this new model is nothing like that older version. It's got a sleeker, tapered look, and feels much better, including in the keyboard. It's a pound lighter, and adds USB3 and DisplayPort.The T420s has got great specs for both Win7 and Win8: 8GB memory, fast NVidia 1GB VRAM graphics (optional, be sure to get it), multitouch trackpad, and 1600x900 screen rez. And you can open the screen flat-out horizontal, which I love for my desk stand. Built in 720p webcam, stereo mic, and stereo speakers are great for GoToMeeting. The super-thin LED screen is anti-glare, not gloss, and I like that. But the 300:1 contrast isn't remarkable. Movies look a little flat on it.But this is not a multimedia machine, it's a work platform. Text and graphics look stunning. The 14\" high-rez widescreen has very sharp resolution. The notebook is not thin, either, but it's very light, with an extremely robust magnesium frame case. At an inch thick and four pounds, the thing is no problem for a briefcase. I wouldn't want to tote it in a sleeve, though.  I recommend third-party upgrading to 8GB of RAM, since you can get a whole 8GB kit for just fifty bucks these days. I run VMware Workstation on mine and use it as a virtualization platform, with an external SSD to hold VHDs (a sweet little Oyen USB3 port-powered speedster).Typical notebook networking: a GigE port, and built-in Intel Centrino 1x2bgn, which doesn't seem spectacular. But with two internal PCI slots, you could put in a real MIMO card if you needed it.Some innovative touches: the \"ThinkLight\" keyboard flood light (on the screen top middle), rather than back-lighted keys, so you get some terrific ambient illumination when working in the dark. I love that!  The keyboard is spill-resistant, and for a frequent air traveler that's important. It's got USB3, SD, and ExpressCard. ExpressCard is nice for adding additional ports such as Ethernet, serial, eSata, etc. Alas, it lacks HDMI, but it has a DisplayPort, so it can drive two external 27\" monitors with some inexpensive adapters. It's got a modular bay design, so you can, for example, replace the DVD drive with an aux battery or second HD. All tool-less: click, slide, snap, you've completely reconfigured the machine! I put a second 500G HD in mine, and use an external SSD as well. I have lots of bits ;)I do wish it had an external mic or stereo line in, though. Without that, I'm stuck with USB audio for SDR, a hobby of mine. I'll have to get an ExpressCard for that.And after a year-long stint with a Dell, the Lenovo's compact, super-thin external power supply is a traveler's joy.With the new model out, the T420s are priced right, too.", "Date": "August 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Best Thinkpad yet", "Author": "Streetbeat \"Russ\"", "ReviewID": "R3MHAAM72RONH0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the t420s; it's the best thinkpad I've owned to date.  I haven't had a thinkpad this thin since my t40, and that was a long while ago.  The keyboard remains solid, and the exterior is as nice as ever.  Sandy bridge is nice and powerful as advertised.  Battery is long enough, but as always longer would be nicer.Boots quick and the ThinkVantage software is still excellent.One big seller for me is the APS (Active Protection System).  This stops the moving hard drive when motion is detected to prevent data loss in the event of a dropped laptop or whatever.  To my knowledge, this feature is only available in Thinkpads and Macbooks.Another cool feature: one of the USB ports will charge devices when the computer is in sleep, and even some phones (for example, the iPhone) when powered completely off!  This is an awesome feature which can turn your laptop into a charging station (for example on a long flight, when you might care more about having your phone powered than laptop).Main complaint is the slim HDD bay which can only take special 7mm HDDs.  There are only 2 7200RPM HDDs which fit in that bay (the 320GB and a recently released 500GB).  With the falling prices of SSDs, this isn't a big problem.Bluetooth, Centrino Ultimate-N, 720p Webcam, USB3.0, DisplayPort.  These are great modern features.What an excellent machine this sturdy and thin T420S is!", "Date": "June 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Daily driver; can't go wrong with Thinkpad", "Author": "Thomas Hundt", "ReviewID": "R16ABUBR21VETS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "You can't go wrong with a Thinkpad and this T model is your business workhorse circa a couple of years ago.  Which means it's still fine for today (5/2014).  I5 cpu is great.

So far it's been bulletproof.  It was very fast when I first got it.  It's slowing down a bit now, which means it's time for me to back up all my data and reinstall the OS.  All the junk I've installed on it over the years has slowed it down quite a bit.In my office I have two large Dell monitors.  This laptop powers the two displays just fine.  I can even add a third if I felt like leaving the lid open on the laptop, but I don't have enough room on my desk and I prefer to close the lid when it's docked.The keyboard is very comfortable and responsive.  The track pad is decent or I can use the little red button thingy as a pointer if I don't like track pads (I never really use that thing though).I use the built in camera and mic at least once a day for video calls.  I've never had a problem with either one of them.The 14\" display is OK, but not great.  The quality of the image is fine and the screen stays pretty clean, but I prefer a larger display.  I work remotely quite a bit though and I get used to the small display pretty quickly.I've traveled a zillion miles with this thing and it has put up with a ton of abuse.  I try to take good care of it, but it's inevitable that it gets bumped and dinged quite a big going through security, etc.  I also take public transportation to work (a train and a bus).  Public transportation is a full contact sport.  My bag gets knocked all over the place.  This laptop has held up just fine though.I work this little machine pretty hard.  I document technical services for a living, so it's pretty common for me to have complicated applications running (the apps that I'm documenting) as well as the tools that I use to document them with (Photoshop, Visio, Dreamweaver, Word, etc.).  I usually have at least three of these tools running at the same time without too much of a performance hit.At the end of this year when it's time for IT to issue me another machine, I'll be happy if it's the latest & greatest version of this same line.  I have no complaints with this one.", "Date": "April 18, 2014"}, {"Title": "it's very stable", "Author": "Chuan", "ReviewID": "R1MZHKSAE8R37B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I saw some negative reviews about this laptop and decided to give my opinions.

It's light and fast, if I had just one complaint it's that I need more memory but that isn't that big of a deal as I have a large external hard-drive to save excess photos and videos.I have no idea why some of these reviewers have had issues, maybe they did not have good virus protection/firewall setup. I am using ESET NOD32 virus protection and it never bothers me and I have never had a problem.I use this computer for designing marketing brochures and office management. Almost every day I have Outlook, Word, Excel, OneNote, InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop etc open simultaneously. I very rarely experience lags in opening documents.I searched for this computer just now because I was thinking about buying one for myself since this is my work computer.

They will make you wait, transfer you, make you wait some more, transfer you again and in the end may not even solve the problem.My actual story? Bought a brand new Thinkpad and a month later motherboard dies! Lenovo refuses to replace the machine (or failing part) under warranty. I'd like to point out that I use my computer at a laboratory at my school so I didn't have any accidents with the computer nor was it directly exposed to the elements. In short, Lenovo sold me a $1000 defective unit, failed to own up to the problem and wasted my time and money... not cool.- Lenovo refused to repair the computer under warranty attempting to charge me $750 for the repair. I'm a poor college student who had already WASTED over a grand on a computer -- I can't afford that!- I called IBM 4 U and explained my problem. They sent me another box so I could send back my nonworking machine.- The EZ serv people once again could not fix the computer without me paying. This time they needed to replace the speakers as well... uhh, there was nothing wrong with the speakers.- Sent me the computer back without fixing it.- I have to add as well that Lenovo has absolutely no interest in following up on you experience. And, because it's such a pain to have to ship and receive the computer multiple times, it becomes an exhausting problem.Conclusion - Defects in computers are unavoidable and you might be the unlucky person to waste money and time in such an unfortunate way. However, you may avoid this problem by buying your machine from a physical store so you are not jerked around and left feeling powerless.
