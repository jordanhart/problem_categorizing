Then, after buying 4 kinds of microphones i noticed the external microphone is broke. Amazon sent me to talk directly with Hp, no way, Hp is imposible to reach, nobody helped. Two weeks ago i went to Best Buy to buy a printer, the salesman told me to bring the laptop so they can sent it to Hp,two weeeks ago i received a e-mail from Hp warning about the broken microphone, i hope i can change this laptop with one with internal webcam and internal microphone, my laptop is still in guarantee so,i hope to change it.", "Date": "September 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Perfect Laptop for the $$", "Author": "R.

It is lightweight, fast efficient, and came with Windows 7 preloaded. If there is any complaint, it is that the battery life is not as long as claimed. For me, it only seems to stay charged for about 2 hours before needing to be plugged in, and that may be due to the fact I play lots of games on it. Over all it is an excellent laptop, and I highly recommend it.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "HP G60-501NR Laptop Review", "Author": "Philip D.

It was easy to start up.  Windows 7 is a nice operating system, I ahev not had any problems.  I would like to see a longer lasting battery, the description did state @ 3 hours, but it would have been nice to have at least 5-6 hours.  If I used this outside the house it would be a problem,  My college age children  have different model HPs with no problems except the batteries, which I have had to replace (ordered from Amazon at a great price).

Wolf", "ReviewID": "R3PR5QTNBMMY0S", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "What I like:1. Unlike other HP laptops I have owned recently this one does not have the heat problems the others have had.  (this might in part be due to only having a single processor)2. Nice case design3. I personally like the touch pad on this model better than several of the other HPs I have owned4. It ships with Windows 7 and so far this has been a very stable systemCons:1.Only 2 G of RAM (this however is a very easy fix and HP has great video and illustrations on their web site for adding laptop RAM)2.With the single processor even some basic computing seems to slow down.  (However I am still able to run the latest version of Adobe Photoshop Elements which is a bit of a resource hog)I got this on a lightning deal at even at a higher price point I feel this is a nice value for the dollar for someone who is looking for a basic entry level laptop.", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Price and Performance", "Author": "J.

Don't be fooled by the Celeron label...normally I would stay away from Celeron go with its bigger brother Pentium.  But in this case, with its upgraded W7 OS this computer diver on performance any normal user can enjoy.  Don't just look at the Gigahertz and Gigabytes...think about what your daily function will require.  If you are not a heavy gamer or a super duper tech savvy guy who will ping the living crap out of  a processor...this laptop will more than satisfy your daily activities for the next several years.Pro: Price and performanceCon: Battery life", "Date": "December 10, 2009"}, {"Title": "Lightening deal buy", "Author": "Archana Kedar \"Cheche\"", "ReviewID": "R2RCO594TIYM4B", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I won this laptop on lightening deal on black Friday.

I bought one for my father when it was only sale for $299.99 one morning at like 2:30am central time. I set it up for him and I have been using it and it performs very well... sad to say almost too well when compared to my 2007 MacBook.I would recommend it to anyone. In the sub 300 dollar range you can't get anything better. The screen has a very nice resolution and widescreen picture. The HDMI port and 5in1 card reader are nice additions. There really are no draw backs that I can see. I waited at Walmart for two similar HP laptips on black Friday... granted they are a bit different, but bottom line... waiting in line for 8hrs or just buying it with one click shopping on Amazon.... ummm I would take amazon any day.I would put a value on this computer around $350 dollars... maybe more depending on how badly I would want one. If you can get it cheaper than that BUY IT!!! Compared to a stripped down netbook versus this very nicely equipped HP model... hands down get the HP!!!!Bottom Line: nicely equipped, every day laptop. That is good for at home or possibly on the go. I wish it went past its lackluster looks design wise... but it still performs great and is a good price.", "Date": "December 2, 2009"}, {"Title": "No Webcam as Described But Good Value Anyway", "Author": "C.

I am still satisfied with the purchase given I got it as a Black Friday deal and am using it more like a Netbook for surfing the Internet, networking and checking email. My more powerful tasks that require more memory will remain on another laptop, but this one is more portable and has better battery life.Likes:1. Lightweight2. Good battery life3. Nice 16:9 widescreen - graphics are HD quality.4. Windows 7 - it's nifty5. Number pad on the keyboard6. button to turn wifi off and power button are the only 2 buttons on this machine7. lightscribe8. Cost - got this for $197 during Black Friday!! That's the best part!9. Not filled with a bunch of crap software I won't use. Thank you HP. :)10. Easily connected to my wireless HP printer in one easy step11. Connected immediately to my home network with no problems12. Straight out of the box and was using it in 2 minutes!13. Slick integrated mouse pad design with lock button - easy to use.14. Appears to be expandable to 4gb.Challenges:1. volume is either controlled by the mouse on the tool bar or by using the function key and a volume key - no slide like other HP laptops2. no locking mechanism, the screen just folds down but doesn't latch to the keyboard like others3. Only one headphone jack, no sharing4. no docking station port! It will not fit my existing docking station :(5. no webcam for those who think it's on here.Also includes - 5 in one card reader (not CF cards though), an HDMI port, monitor port, 3 usb ports and the standard ports for ethernet and modems.All in all, a good value for what I paid for it and even a good value for the current price it's being sold at. Really only lacks blueray, the docking station port and the webcam to be more flexible but I can do without those things for this price.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "***NO WEBCAM** Mic is not working properly", "Author": "S.
