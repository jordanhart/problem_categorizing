It is the perfect combination of the useful features of both a laptop and an android device. You can do  word processing yet use apps. Connects on  wifi , hard wired or phone-type internet service. It has two usb plug-ins so can take a memory stick, and an HDMI plug so you can watch things on your TV.  It has a real keyboard and it even comes with a mouse! If you're used to Windows, the android system  takes a little getting used to, but just play around with it and  it's not hard to figure out. I bought this as a gift for a friend with limited computer knowledge and I think it will be perfect for her.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!!", "Author": "Shellie Lynn  Miller", "ReviewID": "R3U0HJSLVF0UCV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Small, compact, everything you need for a laptop!!!

Its really a fine machine.

It is actually a christmas present, so I have not messed with it a whole lot.  I just opend it charged it to make sure it was in working condition and it all seems well.

It was kind of a pain to get around that, and slowed my typing considerably.  Strike one.  I then noticed that it was often slow to respond, and sometimes (more often than it should have) shut down on a whim.  Strike two.  I then had it plugged in to charge, and heard this fizz-pop sound, and a slight burnt plastic smell.  It overheated, and apparently fried the thing.  It hasn't worked since (screen will light up when turned on, but will not go to any welcome screen and then shuts off).  Strike three.  Game over.Do not purchase this.  It is not worth a dime, much less the price they're charging.  This is an example of an off-brand that just doesn't measure up.", "Date": "May 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not buy!", "Author": "StoneTotem", "ReviewID": "R1DS3R0DL8PVQ9", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I got this and had to return the 1st one cause it wouldnt turn on...Had to pay return shipping and got the new one a week later the new one doesnt turn on or do anything....Do not waste your time...", "Date": "March 23, 2014"}, {"Title": "Poor Screen Quality", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"Eclectic Artist\"", "ReviewID": "R31WGED7K5T266", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This laptop was just what I was looking for, it is small, light weight, and runs the Android operating system, so it will sync with my existing tablet and phone.
