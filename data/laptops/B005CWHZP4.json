{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Comparison to the 2011 Macbook Pro 13\"", "Author": "Wayne Ngo", "ReviewID": "R2LLIU8IKLIHPA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "*2012 Pro and Air models are available but the designs remain the same meaning the physical aspects covered below are the same as well.The primary features of the 2012 13\" MacBook Air are:- Ivy Bridge processor + HD 4000 graphics (60% better performance)- USB 3.0- 720p webcam- 2x SSD read speeds. Write speeds didn't change.- $100 price dropI've owned the machine for 10 months now and have simplified the review for your convenience.Things I like:+ Light weight; 2.9 lbs (1.3 kg). You can easily hold it with one hand - the MBP 13\" is noticeably heavier at 4.5 lbs.+ Solid build quality like the MBPs. Chassis is rock solid, no keyboard flex, screen housing is rigid with minor flex in the middle.+ Better ergonomics than the MBPs; the palm rest edges don't dig into your wrists like the edges on the MBPs do.+ Same fluid multitouch trackpad and the backlit keyboard makes a return.+ The screen is a pleasure to use with it's high resolution (1440 x 900) and semi-gloss finish.There is no glass cover so there will be dramatically less reflections compared to the screen of the MBPsI personally chose the Air over the Pro because of reduced glare.+ 18 second boot ups and 3 second shut downs. Resumes from sleep within 3 seconds.+ The two USB 2.0 ports are on opposite sides of the laptop (less clutter than MBP)+ Speakers are surprisingly loud; they can fill up a small room.+ Runs extremely cool and it's so quiet that you'll wonder if the fan is running at all.I can definitely feel heat ~ 87 degrees F on the MPB 13's underside after 6 hours of usewhere as the MBA 13's underside stayed relatively cooler.+ Runs Windows 7 just as cool and quietly. (I installed Windows 7 via flash drive)+ Performance is almost identical to the MBP 13\" 2011 on everyday tasks because the Core i5CPU can turbo boost to 2.7 GHz and the SSD allows for instant application launching.+ Gaming: it has the same Intel HD Graphics 3000 as the MBP 13\" 2011. I was able to runStarcraft II smoothly at low settings on native resolution. Medium settings also ran nicely butyou get less FPS during large battles. League of Legends ran smoothly at medium settings30 FPS flat) on native resolution._______________________________________________________________________________________________________Things I don't like:- *IMPORTANT* Wifi drops - have been less frequent in the wake of more updates from Apple.- The keyboard is shallower and has less travel than the MBP keyboards (you'll get used to itwithin a few days)- The screen has less color gamut than the MBP 13's screen. This screen covers only 46% ofsRGB color spectrum where as the MBP 13's screen covers 77%. For image editing,I would use an external monitor.- The vertical viewing angles aren't so great. One minute tilt of the screen causes colors to shiftdramatically (for example: a purple color can change from lavender to light blue as you tiltthe screen backward or forward). Again, I would use an external monitor for tasks inwhich accurate colors are mission critical. For everyday use it's not noticeable and isactually easier on the eyes than the glare-prone screens of the MBPs.- Not all models come with the same SSD. There are 2 variations; a Samsung SSD and aToshiba SSD. The Samsung SSD significantly outperforms the Toshiba SSD inbenchmarks (check the AnandTech review)To check what SSD you have, click on the Apple logo -> About this Mac ->more info/system report -> then look on the left hand side and click on \"Serial- ATA\".If your SSD's serial number starts with \"SM\" it's a Samsung and a \"TS\" means it's aToshiba.- I personally get 5 hours of battery life max on a single charge while surfing with 10+ tabs open on safari; I got~7 hours doing the same tasks on the MPB 13 2011. My activities included watchingYouTube videos, viewing flash content on tech and news sites, reading/writing email,and using AIM.- No FaceTime HD Camera (720p) as on the MPBs. The quality difference is, unfortunately,very noticeable.- The integrated microphone is located on the side of the laptop instead of on top of the keyboardas on the MBP. During Skype calls, my buddies told me that my voice sounded muffledwhen using the Air. Using a headset with a mic, I was able to improve the sound quality.- The base of the machine developed a creaking noise within the first week of use. I suspect this to becaused by uneven tension in the screws.- after 5 months of, a white cluster of stuck pixels developed in the bottom left corner of the screen.The machine has been handled with care so it's not accidental damage._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Conclusion: Which one should you get?As a college student, I would recommend the Macbook Pro 13\". The Air is more than capable of being a primary machine becauseof it's superb performance and overall very good screen. For everyday tasks, it should be snappy and an ease to use.However, students will get a $100 discount on the Pro while the Air only provides a $50 discount. This means that there is a pricedifference of $150 for students. The storage space on the Air is imited to 128GB or 256GB while the Pro comes standard with 500GB.Plus, you can always add a SSD to the Pro later on. The Pro will be the better choice for creative students because it's screen has more colorgamut than the Air's. Lastly, you are getting a full voltage processor which can make a differencein video encoding or other CPU intensive tasks.If you are not a student:If you value the extra ports (Ethernet, Firewire, optical drive), a high gamut screen (although more reflective), a 720p webcam(it's a lot better), and the ability to upgradelater down the line - go for the Pro.If you prioritize portability (light weight), higher screen resolution, fast boot ups/shut downs, and less reflections - go for the Air.In everyday performance the Air feels faster when booting up and launching applications because of its SSD. In CPU intensive tasks,the Pro will have a slight edge but not much. (the two CPUs are actually pretty neck to neck on GeekBench benchmarks). They bothhave the same graphics chip but note that the Pro will get better battery life (1-2 hours more) than the Air because the Pro has a biggercapacity battery (63.5 watt-hours vs. 50 watt-hours)Unfortunately, my unit is affected with a wifi drop problem. I don't know if you will encounter the same issue but if you buy an Air froman Apple Store, make sure to test the wifi out by using it on multiple networks. If you encounter any erratic wifi drops withinthe first 14 days - demand a refund or an exchange._________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Update - December 27th, 2011After installing the 10.7.2 and a firmware update, the wifi connections in my dorm room became more reliable.However, after taking it home I experienced drops as before on the home network. I DOUBT it's a problem with myrouter because ALL other connected devices work fine. The 2011 MBP 13\" I previously owned worked flawlessly on my network.This is most likely a problem with the Air's drivers. 5 months after product launch, I don't believe Applehas acknowledged the issue or either chose to IGNORE it as other users on the official forums continue tohave similar complaints even to this day.Hardware wise,  the casing held up well except for a scratch on the side. The lid is frighteningly thin and I've readreports of the screen's fragile nature - cracking at the slightest bump by another object. I would handle with care.Want to know something funny? With the machine off, I can see through the Apple logo on the lid if there's lightbehind it - it's that thin.Software wise, sometimes the machine would run hot with fans blazing full throttle when watching HD YouTube videosand would remain that way even though I close everything. Very odd. A quick reboot solves the problem.A creaking sound developed within a week of purchase. When I lift the machine up, press on the palm rest or type on itthere would be a creaking noise produced. I suspected the screws of the bottom to be loose so I decided to tighten them.Note that you'll have to order a pentalobe screwdriver to do this - the screws aren't the typical type._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________January 9th, 2011A cluster of 4-5 stuck pixels developed so I went to get a screen replacement. The Apple genius confirmed it was4-5 pixels which qualified me for a screen replacement. Service was prompt and I got the machine the next day.However, the new screen had 2 clearly visible dead pixels in the center of the screen. I tried using it for a few daysbut they were an absolute distraction.Dissatisfied, I took it back to another genius only to be met with rude service. I stated that the dead pixels hinderedfunctionality as they were visual distractions. He snidely responded with, \"Where? I don't even see them\" and remainedadamant about not replacing it because I didn't qualify for the \"minimum of 5 dead pixels for a replacement\" policy.It was an unpleasant experience to say the least and didn't help._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________March 11th, 2011I've learned to live with the two dead pixels on the screen and Apple has released an update (10.7.3) to address thewireless card. I've noticed that with Bluetooth off, the connections are pretty stable around campus and at home.I've not yet tested this with Bluetooth - it makes me curious because people on the official forums report wifi drops whenenabling Bluetooth. Anyway, After 7 months of ownership I would say most of the initial bugs have been remedied andthe Air is a pleasure to use. However, I speculate that the Pro and Air lineup will be updated to Ivy Bridge in the summer(along with the rumored redesign of the Pros). Buy now if you need it but if you can - waiting might be better.Cheers!", "Date": "July 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Looks, Speedy Laptop. Gets hot and loud under moderate CPU load.", "Author": "Alex Green \"alx779\"", "ReviewID": "R3MKO486GGK450", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have been using my new 13\" Macbook Air, 256GB, Core i7 for just over a week and here are my impressions...First, the good stuff...- The industrial design is absolutely gorgeous and rock-solid. The laptop is thin, light and pleasure to look at.- Screen is 13\" but the resolution is comparable to that of most 15\"+ laptops. Perfectly usable for graphic/software development. While Macbook Air uses (supposedly) an inferior TN panel compared to Macbook Pro, I did not find a drastic difference between the two (I also own a 17\" Macbook Pro). The Air has slightly smaller viewing angles and perhaps not as good colour reproduction, but the differences are subtle. Also, there's a lot less glare on Air's \"glossy\" display compared to glossy Macbook Pro.- Performance is great, in some cases it bests the Quad Core i7 17\" Macbook Pro, thanks to its SSD Drive. Startups/shutdowns are super fast and the applications open/close almost instantly. Having said that, do not expect to do any serious gaming on this little guy. The built-in Intel graphics chip has hard time handling even 5 year old games and is actually slower than nVidia chip on the previous generation Air.- Expect to get about 4-5 hours of mixed use out of \"7 hour\" battery. That's what I average while doing some Photoshop and web dev work, browsing, listening to music and viewing a few video clips.Now, the negatives...Well, it's one negative really, but it is something I find extremely annoying. The laptop gets VERY hot when CPU usage approaches 50% and the fan kicks in full-blast at 6,000+ RPM.I first noticed the excessive noise when I was transferring my data and applications from the time machine backup upon initial setup. The fan stayed on entire time, CPU temperature was approaching 90C while being only 30% utilized.I continued to experience high heat/fan noise issues throughout the week. Sometimes it was during routine web browsing where some of the websites contained Flash elements. Starting Windows XP in Parallels would immediately set the fan in motion, again, sometimes hitting 6,000+ rpm. Playing Civilization IV, a fairly old game, had fan going full blast entire time with CPU again reaching 90C. Apple's own \"Cosmos\" screensaver brings the CPU temperature up to 80-85C and the fan up to 4500-5000rpm. The most annoying thing -- none of these tasks were taxing the CPU at more than 50%!I did a fair bit of research on this issue. There are multiple discussions on Apple, MacRumours and other forums about excessive heat and fan noise. Also, many report increased heat on their older Apple laptops after upgrading to Lion, so perhaps (fingers crossed), there's a patch on the way that will improve thermal management somewhat.The thought about returning the Air for refund did cross my mind, but I decided to keep it in the end. I am not a gamer and doing my work (web/mobile development) is not very taxing on the CPU, however, I do not think it is unreasonable to expect relatively quiet operation on such premium laptop with only 50% CPU usage. I can only hope that Apple is listening and looking to remedy the problem.***Update: March 28, 2012***It has been several months since I purchased the Air, so I thought I'd write a quick update.There were no software updates from Apple that would fix the overheating issue. Some claim in the comments that the thermal problems are limited to Macbook Air Core i7 version, however, I got to play with friend's Core i5/120Gb Air and got the fan hitting 6,000+ rpm simply by opening two browser tabs with YouTube videos in them. The playback has become choppy pretty quickly as well. The fan was also audible on pages with a few Flash elements in it (like newspaper sites). It seemed slightly (very slightly) less prone to heat issue, but it's definitely there.I also played around with an 11\" Macbook Air Core i5 at the Apple Store and, interestingly enough, it handled Flash far better than (supposedly) more powerful 13\"... I opened 5! 1080p YouTube videos and still wouldn't hear the fan... Quite amazing actually. The difference seems to be the i5/i7 processors in the 13\" Air that can hit higher clock speeds but nearly frying the internals in the process.If you find your Macbook Air fan going off like a jet engine every time you visit YouTube or any page with Flash content, here are a couple of browser plugins that I found helpful (they block movies until you specifically click on them):- FlashBlock for Firefox- ClickToFlash for SafariThere's a model refresh coming sometime this summer, apparently, and I hope Apple will figure out the way to solve this problem. Of course, much depends on Intel chips that they're going to use in new models.", "Date": "August 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "The best ultraportable laptop produced thus far...", "Author": "R. Chapman", "ReviewID": "RE4KOXG8PX8RG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Background:For the past two years or so I've gone through numerous brands/models in an incessant search to find a laptop that was easily portable and had enough horsepower to match or exceed the performance of a solid $500 desktop with enough battery life to last over four hours of real world use. In this time span I've gone through over a dozen laptops or netbooks that were eventually returned, sold, donated to family or friends, modded and repurposed, or are currently sitting collecting dust awaiting a similar fate. A short list of the more memorable laptops/netbooks that I've previously owned/used that I can remember off hand include: HP TM2T(Core 2 Duo); HP TM2T(Core i3), Asus T101MT, MacBook Air (2009), Acer 4820TG, HP Envy 14, HP dv7t Quad Edition, ASUS U36JC, MacBook Pro 13, and two lower cost laptop models made by Gateway and Acer that I won't mention because they really didn't fit the criteria I was looking for when I acquired them.I can truly say the 2011 MacBook Air 13\" is the most satisfied I've been with any laptop I've used. Although I do find some quirks with the 2011 MBA lineup they are passable and this product still deserves a full five stars. I will probably echo some of the same pros and cons that others have stated, but let's move on with my review so I can tell you my impressions of this.HARDWARE PROS:- Weight/Form Factor: I've always considered portability to be important in a laptop but I can't emphasize this enough. If you've never held and used a MacBook Air before you should be impressed by its weight and form factor alone. Mostly anyone could easily hold the 13\" MacBook with one hand. It means I can be watching a video and if I need to move to another room in the house and can easily walk with the laptop in one hand. However, I don't think it is light/comfortable enough to hold while standing for prolonged periods of time. I've demonstrated how light it is to several people under 5 feet tall by stand and watch a YouTube video holding the MBA with one. So, if you're concerned about the 13\" size because you're short you shouldn't let that deter you until you actually try it.- Core i5 2nd Generation Sandy Bridge Processor/ 4GB RAM Standard: When I first got the 2009 MBA I was extremely impressed by its form factor and weight as stated above, but after trying to use the 2009 MBA for productivity and multitasking you realize that something is amiss in the hardware and this eventually leads to frustration. The 2009 and 2010 MacBook Air base models only included 2GB of RAM and missed an entire generation of Core i-series processors, and despite having a solid state hard drive and a dedicated graphics card their of value in price to performance was very underwhelming compared to what was available for much less at the time. I currently have 16 tabs opened across four windows in Firefox, 5 tabs in Chrome, two applications(Silverlight and Java) streaming live financial quotes, DropBox, iTunes and a P2P application running while I am typing this review. I haven't noticed any noticeable hitches in performance. I have read about others complaining about issues with various Adobe software (especially Flash) with the latest version of OS X Lion. I have only experienced some sluggishness once when resuming from deep sleep. For testing I used a downloaded Flash game. It took a little more than 10 seconds to re-render. However, this may have more to do with the integrated graphics and could possibly be corrected in the future with an update.- Solid State Drive: There's not much to say here. If you've never experienced the performance leap from using a SSD then you will probably be more than a little impressed by the much faster load/boot times. I've installed SSDs on a few computers after talking up the performance boosts. I guess they were expecting everything to be instantaneous. Anyway, it's very noticeable in Bootcamp running Windows over the MBP 13 I've been using or when transfering/copying larger files. You can read more about the much faster load/boot times from other reviews online.- Trackpad: Quite often, previous MacBook owners don't mention this as a Pro. However, the trackpad is the biggest reason why I prefer a MacBook as my laptop of choice. I grew tired of the jumping cursors, crappy drivers, and erratic touchpad gestures. For some reason Synaptic and most PC vendors overlook or can't seem to get it right. How do you neglect its importance as the primary functioning hardware you use to actually interact with your computer. The trackpad on the MBA just works. It works so well and is far more than accurate enough that I actually prefer not using a mouse with my laptop because of it.- Backlit Keyboard: The keyboard itself may take some getting used to if you've never used a MacBook before. However, once you grow accustomed to the layout you will enjoy the amount of travel and \"clickiness\" to it. Thankfully, the backlight was brought back for the 2011 lineup. I don't understand why this feature was removed to begin with since it doesn't impact battery life that much. It's clutch and greatly appreciated in low lit environments.- Build: It's the same aluminum casing material used in all the MacBook models and the same chassis design that was used in the 2010 model. Solid constructionHARDWARE CONS:- No USB 3.0: Although USB 3.0 is not as ubiquitous USB 2.0 it is quickly growing and peripherals are far more abundant and less expensive than Thunderbolt peripherals. USB 3.0 will likely remain far more popular than Thunderbolt after Apple's exclusivity expires next year because USB 3.0 is more cost-effective to produce and is backwards compatible with the millions of USB 2.0 devices already available. I agree with other reviewers in that this reduces the future proofing of this model, and it seems like Apple's Firewire vs USB 2.0 situation repeated. (I digress that at least there are two USB 2.0 ports on opposite ends. My original 2009 MBA had one.)- Facetime Camera not High Definition: I try not to show my mug on camera but sometimes I have to use it to speak to clients via remote connections and occasional video conferencing. Again, considering the profit margins on each MBA sold I don't understand the reason to exclude this feature other than Apple being Apple and including this as an improved feature for next year.- Power Button: The power button is placed in the keyboard layout right above the delete key!!! It's where the eject button is on my MBP right above the Delete key. Yes, I just praised the keyboard in the Pros. Until you grow accustomed to this your chances of accidentally hitting the power button by mistake in the beginning is likely. It won't shut your computer down or put the computer to sleep. It simply brings up the power down dialog, but it's still a questionable button placement.- Memory is not upgradeable: Not much more to add here. 4GB is enough for me and the SSD is definitely a huge boost to hard drive caching.- Need adapters for HDMI, VGA, DVI. At this price and considering the profit margins on each unit sold the adapters at least an adapter for HDMI or VGA should be included. Meh...OS X LION PROS: (because it deserves its own section)- Mission Control and Spaces: I really like it. I used spaces on Snow Leopard with full screen apple(via third party apps) and this makes using it that much easier. You can drag windows from Space to Space to re-arrange your groups. It's a great improvement that can be improved.- Cloud/App Store Operating System Installation: No 50 character CD Keys, scratched backup disks, or corrupt files on your thumb drive. Cheaper prices.- Automatic Resume: It seamlessly automatically saves the last state of your applications. Some users don't like that applies universally to every open app, but it's very simple to prevent from occurring. If you are done with an and want to prevent said app from automatically restoring simply right click its icon in the dock press option and select force quit. Another app I've used is Flexiglass which adds the functionality of right clicking the red X to completely close an app and all its windows.OSX LION CONS: (because it deserves its own section)- Launchpad: This was a poor, not well executed integration into OS X. Out the box the Launchpad replaces the App Folder in the dock that used to be next to documents and the trash bin. I actually stared at the screen for a few moments until I dug through the search results. I've tried to use it. It keeps the desktop icon less cluttered for me and I moved many of the icons I typically place there in the Launchpad. However, customizing the Launchpad has its quirks. For instance, adding and renaming folders/icons in the Launchpad isn't just easily done on the Launchpad by right clicking the icon. You have to open it in Finder to rename it. There are no options to change the gesture in System Preference to view the Launchpad. I truly feel like the default gesture was tested using the midgets or elementary school kids. My hands are too big to consistently do the gesture. You'd think I could palm two basketballs with one hand. Right now, the launchpad is quirky and somewhat redundant. I understand the direction Apple is heading and are thus slowly blending touch-based iOS and traditional Mac OS X, but the way Apps for OS X are distributed and the complete integration is definitely not with us today in any of Apple's lineup. Hopefully, things will improve with future updates. My hopes is that the launchpad serves as a replacement for Show Desktop in the future.- Natural Scrolling: By default scrolling is inverted. Some like it, some don't, most people will find it awkward at first and I'd bet the majority no matter how slim will change this back. I'd prefer an opt-in integration method for this if Apple wanted to change several decades of computing.- Three Finger Back/Forward and Scroll to Top/Bottom:  I don't know why this configuration was changed from 10.6 to 10.7 but out the box you may notice when you run a third party browser such as Firefox or Chrome that you are unable to page back/forward using the old gesture three finger swipe left/right. Well, you have to change \"Swipe between pages\" to \"Scroll Left/Right with Two or Three Fingers\" under Systems Preferences->Trackpad->More Gestures. A gesture that is now missing entirely is three swipe up/down to scroll to top/bottom but I found a solution with an app called BetterTouchTool By Andreas Hegenberg. It's a very good tool to customize the trackpad gestures to your liking.Expose: No minimized apps unless you are using another window of said minimized app. I don't understand the logic as to why this was removed. It was still featured to be working during the beta but has been removed. The last time I can remember having to click more than twice to view a minimized window was Windows 3.1. Again, I would prefer if this option was carried over from the Beta and preferred an opt-in integration method for this if Apple wanted to change a decade plus of computing.OSX LION NEURAL OR MEH: (because it deserves its own section)Many other changes in Lion were under the hood; complete migration to 64-bit and complete Trim support. A lot of the bundled apps have been improved particularly Mail, Lion Recovery, FileVault, AirDrop, Versions, overlay scroll bars. Some improvements are bigger/more noticeable than others. Also, you can now re-size windows from any corner/edge: Nothing innovative; better late than never; nice for those who are coming from Windows and haven't/won't use other third party accessibility apps.OTHER THOUGHTS:- Screen: I've seen others mention the difference in screen quality between the MacBook Air and Pro models. I have noticed a slight difference. Two things that immediately affect your PERCEPTION of the screen are the resolution and the fact that the area surrounding the display on the MBA is metallic gray vs glossy black on the MBP. When you're comparing the two you might not think that matters. The screen on the MBA does use TN panels but they are far better than your typical run of the mill 1024 x 768 that continues to flood the laptop industry that I typically see. Because of its screen resolution I can dock windows side by side easier on the 13\" MBA than I could  with a 17\" HP dv7 quad core edition that I used. No lie.- Battery Life: Don't believe the advertised 7 hours of battery life unless you're using a third party utility or disabling all wireless connections and dimming the screen down. However, I easily get about 5 hours surfing the web indoors. I've gotten a little under four hours streaming financial quotes and actively surfing indoors, but I'd typically have it plugged in if I need it for more intensive productivity tasks. Definitely not as good as the MacBook Pro 13\".- No Restore Drive: I understand this was a concern for some. Apple released the free Lion Recovery Disk Assistant from Apple's support page. You can make your own recovery thumb drive on a low cost thumb drive of your choice or you can order an OS X Lion Thumb Drive for Apple's Mac App Store for $69 which was released today.- Graphics: Will it max Crysis? No... I have a desktop rig for that when I want. This is an ultraportable laptop and IMO it's the best available.OTHER TIPS:Screen Keeps Dimming and Brightening: At first, I thought it was because i was using the charger from my MBP and I was ruining a brand new expensive --- computer, but I was 98% certain that couldn't be the case. I went to Systems Preferences -> Energy Saver and unchecked Slightly dim the display when using this power source but that wasn't the case because it wasn't on battery. Anyway, I unchecked Automatically Adjust Screen Brightness under Display and felt as if 7 million brain cells must've died beforehand because it took a while to figure it out, but that solved it.Security: Please change your broadcasting discoverable wireless settings and enable your firewall under System Preferences. This is especially true if you are going to use this extremely portable laptop in public areas. Although, Macs aren't targeted nearly as much as Windows or the most popular Linux Distros you are not secure if leave the door wide open.I avoided the expensive adapters and bought two aftermarket adapters to suit my needs that have worked well thus far. Kensington USB Mini Dock with Ethernet for Mac/PC which provides 3 USB 2.0 ports and an ethernet port. You can find a HDMI adapter for very cheap. Though, they may only last several months you could order a dozen of them. Again, I strongly recommend BetterTouchTool if you are looking to gain back the same gestures from Snow Leopard.SO, THE QUESTION IS SHOULD YOU CONSIDER BUYING AND WHAT MODEL?Obviously, this depends on your needs and budget. I feel the MBA is the best ultraportable available and if you can go without a DVD drive an a few extra ports my recommendations are the high end 11\" MacBook Air or the base model 13\" MacBook Air as others have stated. The 4GB vs 2GB makes a difference. The deciding factor would be $100, portability, and how much screen real estate you feel you is adequate for you.I considered buying one of the best alternatives, the Samsung Series 9. The included warranty was enticing but I've had to deal with servicing a laptop through the mail four times and it's never pleasant. Resale value was another factor, and though it has one of the best touch pads I've used on Windows until Synaptics releases their next generation touch pads and trackpads it still felt subpar. Ultimately, I decided I wanted to get back into cross-platform development for OS X. However, another decent alternative to consider is the Toshiba Portege R835 if you are looking for an ultraportable with very strong battery life.I want to raise a point not many people write about in their reviews and that is SSD performance over time. Although, OS X Lion includes TRIM support the performance of all solid state drives degrades as you store more data to the drive. I've experienced this with a couple of desktop builds I've done. With some SSD's the performance degradation begins after filling up just half the disk drive, and affects nearly all drives to some extent once the drive is 70% full. This is something to consider when storing data. An external storage solution of some kind is strongly recommended.Currently, there are two different solid state drives that ship with the MacBook Airs. One is made by Samsung and is the higher performing drive and the other is made by Toshiba. You can check which version you have by going to About this Mac->System Report->More Info click Serial-ATA and check the the first two letters of the model after APPLE SSD.  Credit goes to Amazon user Wayne N for pointing this out in his review. I haven't read any benchmarks on the performance over time with the new MBA.I personally purchased the 256GB model because I need to store financial data and I need a large Bootcamp partition for Windows to compose and sample music, coding that involves very large libraries and enough storage for music and the occasional movie if I'm not on my home network. So, everyone's needs are different. Still, SSD size and degradation is something to consider for your intended use. The MBA is not a true desktop replacement especially if you're into playing games (of any kind if you want decent graphics) but I feel that the MBA can serve as a your primary computer depending on your needs.Thanks for reading this lengthy review.

"Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I've been using a Macbook Air for a week now.  I have the 2011 13\" ultimate: i7 1.8GHz, 4GB RAM, and 256SSD.  My main uses are Office for Mac 2011, Skype, internet video, ArcGIS/Windows 7, Mathmatica, Matlab, C/C++, objective-C, and Java. At the moment I mainly use the Air for writing documents.  I am trying to live with the Air as my primary machine and I plan to connect it to a thunderbolt monitor for additional screen real estate.Pros:The Air looks beautiful and Lion is an absolute pleasure to use.  The SSD makes it all work together.  The screen is gorgeous to look at under the right lighting conditions and the resolution is fantastic. The keyboard is generally good. The track pad is awesome and the diagonal cut of the case is much easier for writing on than my previous unibody macbook.Cons:* Build quality. The renowned Apple quality seems to be lacking in my unit. The space bar does not always respond and requires two press from time to time.  The F5 key needs to be hit multiple times in order to work. The case does not seem to fit properly in the lower right corner of the unit and flexes. The screen gets darker edges near the silver bezel.* Skype and facetime.  I find that the placement of the mic on the side of the unit is a disaster for these applications.  I am constantly responding to complaints about poor voice quality that only improves if I turn the machine on its side and speak directly into the mic.  Depending on your use this may not be a big problem, but it is for me.* The screen can be irritatingly reflective under fluorescent lighting, but I can usually adjust my position to compensate.  However, I usually need to use a low screen illumination to get reasonable battery life, which compounds any glare problems.  This is not a major issue unless you are sensitive to glare.* The battery life on my unit is not great.  The first two days I was impressed with 7+ hours.  A week later and I'm lucky to get 4 hours.  Disappointingly the unit does not always seem to hold a full charge.  I'm not even sure I could watch a full-length movie without mains power. Part of the problem is flash, but watching any video drains the battery at an alarming rate.  The battery monitor also does not seem to provide a reasonable estimate of remaining time.* When watching video I have noticeable screen stutter.  This could be a result of the streaming service I use, but I'm not sure.  It is not so bad that I would return the unit for it, but it is there and if you value smooth video then be sure to check it out carefully before you buy.* The Air gets blisteringly hot near the charger connection when running heavy applications. The fan comes on and battery life evaporates.  Some complain the fan is noisy, but my main problem is the impact on battery life.* The ram can only be maxed out at 4GB.  This is really annoying when you need to dual boot and is compounded by the graphics chip using main memory.* There are also two SSDs (Samsung and Toshiba) that the machine ships with. I ended up with the slower Toshiba drive.  I do get the beach ball from time to time, but I could not say that this is related to my unit shipping with the slower Toshiba drive.  Generally things are snappy.  However, instant on is not always instant. I don't know if this is related to the slower Toshiba drive or just the applications I have open.All in all this is a good machine, but not outstanding. I would say the Macbook Air has been seriously overhyped.  It has some strong points.  I enjoy using it and the portability and weight are outstanding.  However, I am genuinely frustrated by the mic placement and poor build quality.  There are solutions, but when you spend $1700 plus tax on a machine I think you have the right to expect it to work. The Toshiba drive is annoying, but may not be significant and the battery life is a worry.  I'm not sure how the machine will standup to the day-to-day grind.This unit is going back to the store and Apple deserves full credit for its return/refund policies.  The 14 day, no restocking fee, window offered to return or exchange a unit is outstanding.**** Update September 30:Apple's customer service is fantastic. Apple provided a new unit which seems to have fewer build quality problems: all the keys work, the unit shipped with the Samsung SSD, and the microphone is much better.  However, I still have problems with the microphone position and sensitivity and while battery life is better on this unit it is still not great for watching video.  Instant on is still not instant on, but I can support other reviewers who have not noticed any performance difference between the Samsung and Toshiba SSDs, although I'm glad I have the samsung drive. All-in-all my new Air deserves at least another 1/2 star, may be even a whole star because of Apple's customer service.", "Date": "September 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "2011 Macbook Air - (Nov 2011) - 1.8 ghz i7 4GB 256GB SSD", "Author": "R.

Just need something that is a BEST FIT at the time i am buying the laptop.>> Well, this happens to be thanksgiving now, so hoping Apple will price match my laptop as its still within the 14 days before it hits Thanksgiving.This review would like to address questions you have over:1) Macbook Air (or) Macbook Pro2) How well Macbook Air will Fit your daily usage & stacks up as a Casual Laptop3) How well the Macbook Air stacks up as a Travel Laptop4) How well the Macbook Air stacks up as a Work/Business Laptop-------------------------------------------------------------My profile:-------------------------------------------------------------1) PC & IT Techie2) Looking to Buy the Macbook Air as my personal Laptop when i am in between IT Consulting Jobs.(Had a work Laptop since the past 5 years and had to hand it over once i changed jobs)3) Previous Macbook Air owner(2010 Macbook Air; 1.8ghz core2duo, 4GB, 128 GB;); (My FIRST Mac; Bought it for my Dad..used it for a bit..and loved it.)4) Travel a lot (Work & Pleasure);5) Budget of $1500-$1600-------------------------------------------------------------B. My Buying considerations/requirements for a new Laptop:-------------------------------------------------------------1) Need a Laptop that MUST/MAY have the Latest & greatest in CPU/Memory/HDD/USB specs2) Need a Laptop that MUST/MAY definitely have a gorgeous screen & High Resolution (1920xwhatever; 1080p)3) Need a Laptop that MUST be Vibrant, easy on eyes; For a 7-8 hr workday on the laptop, i need a Display that is vibrant and less strenuous on eyes;4) Need a Laptop that MUST run Windows 7 also to provide for Corporate VPN connectivity.5) Need a Laptop that MUST be very Light. Preferably 13\" screen(with HiRes)....but 15\" is OK, provided it has the higher resolution.6) Need a Laptop that MUST/MAY have good build Quality and Decent in Looking.7) Need a Laptop that MUST be good to use for Color Editing/Accuracy of colors for Light Home use Photography.8) Need a Laptop that MUST have about 250 GB of space.>> My Documents excluding PICTURES amount to ~100GB.; A 256 GB SSD is the perfect size for me the next 3 yrs.9) Need a Laptop that MUST have about 5 hrs of battery at least (I usually am on 3-3.5 hrs flights in travel)10)Need a Laptop that MUST have a HDMI port to connect and watch movies in TV.-------------------------------------------------------------C. The competition (read Non-Mac and My choices of Laptops)-------------------------------------------------------------1) Not really much into Dell, Toshiba, HP, Lenovo>> Had a Thinkpad before last year and that went just shy of over a year>> The Dell XPS Laptop in my interest was too bulky and looked horrible. Size of screen; 15\" for the desired 1920 resolution.>> The HP Laptop (dv6t - Quad/Select) edition laptop was good on Technical Specs, but again, build was too bulky and Plasticky. Size of screen; 15\" for the desired 1920 resolution2) The Samsung Series 9 Laptop>> When configuring the Samsung Series 9 to have 1.8Ghz Core i7, 8 GB RAM 256 GB SSD, it was coming upto $2100 all incl(give or take another $100); This was too expensive for me..even though the laptop looked good. Besides, i wanted to use MacOS also occassionally as i liked the Interface.3) All the laptops here were about 6 lbs atleast...excluding the Samsung series 9.-------------------------------------------------------------D. Why i bought the Air-------------------------------------------------------------1) ** MacOS2) ** 256 GB SSD was perfect storage vs Speed Size for me.>> I did not need the slower and extra space in the 700 GB 7200 rpm.>> Besides, i wanted to take a laptop and buy an SSD later. I did not want to pay premium for 700 GB drive.3) ** Battery Life (Minimum 5 hrs met my requirement)>> My earlier 2010 Macbook Air core2Duo used to last me >6 hrs between charges4) ** Processor Speed>> I wanted an i7 processor and the updated Macbook Air specs allowed for it.5) ** Screen/Resolution:>> Higher resolution on the 13\" Macbook Air which i believe was greater than the 15\" regular MBP definitely looked good>> A visit to the apple store showed how excellent the screen is>> A Bootcamp installation of Win 7 and the screen really compares with the 15\" 1920x resolution models>> The screen on the macbook air 13\" is phenomenal!...and very easy on the eyes.6) ** RAM:>> While it was tempting to opt for the HP dv6t, which could take upto 16GB RAM, i decided that 4 GB should be enough for my usage in the Macbook Air.7) USB 2.0:>> Would have liked USB 3.0, but decided i would wait the additional time out during data transfers.8) Minidisplay Port to HDMI:>> I used to connect my older 2010 Macbook Air to my HDTV with Video/Audio out. No issues. This was definitely not an issue here.9) Dual Booting into Windows 7 using Bootcamp:>> I actually tried this out last night and it was quite painless.>> Currently typing this review from Win7 on my 13\" Macbook Air.>> Split my 256 GB SSD drive into 85 GB for MacOS and 150 GB for Win7.>> The Windows 7 partition stores my work outlook and regular windows files.To summate my reasoning:Though the Processor in the Macbook Air was not the full quad core i7, my reasoning was the SSD should more than make up for routine tasks.>> For the additional, occassional, slightly heavier processing like editing RAW DSLR images,i hope that the i7 processor i selected as upgrade should more than provide the additional punch.>> Yes. There is a drawback of slightly higher Fan Noise...but this is temporary.>> There was nothing in the market to beat the Value/Lightweight offering of the Macbook Air, when you factor in the SSD.>> The resolution and Screen and battery were all fabulous!-------------------------------------------------------------E. Buying the Macbook Air-------------------------------------------------------------Finally Bought the 13\" Macbook Air 1.8Ghz Core i7, 256 GB SSD, 4 GB RAM>> Total cost with Sales Tax: $1739.00-------------------------------------------------------------F. Usage/Experience with MacOS------------------------------------------------------------->> MacOS Lion is quite nice actually.>> The interface and the Macbook Air screen really pop out for a 13\" screen.>> The OS does not feel heavy/bog down on the available resources>> So far, i have just done general browsing and causal fiddling with the specs.** Will update once i work more.To summate: Love the MacOS Experience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!------------------------------------------------------------------G.

VALUE: Yes.  Apple understands.", "Author": "M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"", "ReviewID": "R3QJMJOUVHYKVV", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Those that saw my previous review of the 2010 11\" MacBook Air will fully understand that title.  The 2010 MacBook Air suffered from a lack of true value, attempting instead to do the absolute minimum in an attempt to appeal to people's aesthetic tastes while sacrificing key features and not pushing the envelope.  Well, with the 2011 version, they have gone back to the drawing board.  Indeed, they have released what the MacBook Air should have been all along.  You can read the specs above for details about what is all here. I'm only focusing on what's improved over the last gen.After re-reading my review, I decided to reorganize things for fluidity.  So I'm going to first start with the general hardware and its approach.  First, let's talk about what's good.- Base 13\" is a great deal if you don't need storage on the device.  The price is set just right, and there are very few compromises here.  You can go to the higher storage for $300 if you want, but honestly, just buy an external for $100.  My opinion.- Apple has returned the backlight keyboard.  There was huge consumer demand for this feature, and removing it was pointless.  The machine is so much better with it back, and did great on the night flight back to San Diego.- Mail is no longer a battery killer.  In the older version of the MacBook Air, running the Mail app used to destroy the battery something fierce.  Battery life is a little lower, but realistically it's good enough for the majority of uses.  If you're a heavy user don't expect to get more than 4 hours out of it.- Backlight keyboard alone does not seem to have very much impact on the battery.  This was a worry for some, it really does not make that much of a difference on the battery at all, to my pleasant surprise.- More, faster RAM included this time around.  This is important for application multitasking.  I don't like that it's soldered on again, but I give them a pass due to the 4GB being standard on the base 13\" unlike last year's debacle.So why'd I knock it down a star?Well...in all fairness, there's absolutely no logical reason that Apple should have ignored USB 3.0 by now.  Even accounting for the addition of the Thunderbolt port, the reality is that USB 3.0 being backwards compatible with 2.0 makes it the best future proofing choice for computers, and one that all competitors have made.  Apple refusing to jump on board is going to hurt their chances of pushing units.  They'll sell a lot of machines as always, but there will come a breaking point.  Even if they wanted to push Thunderbolt harder, it would not have harmed them financially or competitively to include at least one USB 3.0 port.Also, I wasn't really impressed with the quality of the screen.  There's just something...off...about the screen.  It's hard to put into words.  But it just doesn't have that same visual presence as the Pro, or even the 2010 Air.  My understanding is that the panel type has been changed, likely causing this phenomenon.  There's pixelation in places, and the text doesn't have the same clarity as with the Pro line.  There were some compromises here.  For day-to-day usage it's not a deal breaker, but it's noticeable and thus I note it here.  Don't expect \"magical\" screen quality.  If the screen quality all around matters and you have a keen eye like me, go for a Pro.Battery life is also quite finicky.  I know it's rated at \"up to 7 hours\" but I want to stress that this is under EXTREMELY conservative use cases.  I'm talking Safari only, no flash, low backlight keyboard, low screen brightness.  On the plane when they dimmed the cabin lights, I was able to go to one notch on the screen and backlight, which let me see perfectly, and then it lasted quite well.  But here at home, with the screen brightness at just over halfway, running Mail, Firefox and Safari (because right now Safari is the default browser for Mail links), I'm hovering around 5 hours, which isn't bad.  Yet if Spotlight gets fired up and indexing, I watched in horror as that figure went down to 2 hours under the same conditions.Lastly, I am compelled to knock them for their refusal to at least include a USB restore drive in the box.  I know they're pushing downloads and streaming media, but the reality is that physical media for computer restoration is almost a necessity.  The novelty of an internet-based reinstall is nice, and they can keep that, but I still say that they should have included the Lion OS on a USB drive like they did with the 2010.  The additional cost is pennies for that drive, so cost isn't the reason.  They're pushing an agenda, and I don't like being tethered to the internet if and when I need to reinstall my operating system.  There is a hidden recovery partition for this purpose that you can also use.  But I think Apple is missing the boat here.  What if the drive itself, the physical drive, goes toast?  You're stuck unless you pay money.  Thus the value of having external media for restoration if and when that were to happen.  The SSD bar in the Air is replaceable, and there are already options from OWC for those users.  But it's useless unless you pay $30 to download Lion and burn it/write it yourself or pay Apple $70 for a USB stick with Lion on it.  To me both are unacceptable alternatives for something that should be in the box of every computer.-_- Mac OS X 10.7, CODE NAME LION -_-I want to interject here and state for the record that the majority of what bothers me with this purchase really has more to do with Lion, the newest operating system from the Apple, rather than the Air hardware itself.  Based on my experience, the Lion OS is a step in the wrong direction.  Apple is attempting to blend what we know of Mac OS with what certain users know of iOS, and the output is a very clunky experience at times.  They introduced plenty of new features, and changed some tried and true features at the same time.  It's clear they are attempting to create a single OS for both tablets and the desktop OS, but it's just...wrong.Apple introduced a new feature, Mission Control, which is designed to act as the evolution of Expos\u00e9 and Spaces. The problem is that Mission Control is finicky.  It wants each app to be run in Full Screen to be able to separate them correctly within a single desktop.  However...running apps full screen is a bit of a pain because it disables the Dock.  Thus if you're running Firefox, let's say, in full screen you can't then see the unread count on Mail in the Dock.  This basically forces you to run a Desktop that is just a Desktop and then run other apps in their own Desktop space. If you don't run apps in full screen, Mission Control then just \"Paper stacks\" them in a very unorganized fashion within the same Desktop.  If an app is minimized into the Dock, it does not show in Mission Control.  This seems bass-ackwards...if it is minimized into the Dock it should be one of the icons on top in Mission Control automatically.  The only way to force this is to manually create the Desktop and assign the app to it, or full screen the app and then switch out of it.I know that's hard to understand, but the bottom line is that the approach isn't very well implemented.Apple has introduced another feature, Launchpad, which is essentially an iPad view of all of the local applications.  It supports the grouping concept also found on iOS.  Anyone who owns an iPod Touch or an iPad/iPhone will instantly recognize this.  The idea is obvious; the concept of it just does not work on a full computer.  It translates on a simple touch interface, but not a computer where you're not really touching.  It should be obvious that the intent is to have one operating system for both desktops and tablets in an attempt to extend iOS beyond its limitations and dumb down the desktop experience.  I get it.  But beyond the obvious issues, there are more functional problems.  Launchpad shows queued up downloads or updates to existing apps rather than the app itself.  So for example, I saw there was an upgrade for iPhoto and started it from the App Store when I was on the plane.  But when I saw it was over 600MB I stopped it.  Problem is that made iPhoto unavailable from Launchpad because it changed to a download prompt instead of the app.  It's not a deal breaker, as one could go to the Applications folder by exiting Launchpad or not using it, but it's something to note...Apple's got some work to do.\"Natural scrolling\" is a joke.  It turns over 20 years of computing on its head and not in a good way.  I turned that stuff off the moment I saw it.  For those that don't know what this is, Apple has set the default scroll behavior to where the window will scroll in the same direction as where you scroll your fingers/mouse.  So for example, right now if you scroll a window down, the the page will go up so you read down the page.  That's logical.  In the default scroll of Lion, if you do the same downward scroll, the page will move down.  So if you want to read towards the bottom like normal people, you would scroll up, because you're \"pulling the page up\" in order to read downwards.  If it sounds confusing, it is.  I disabled this immediately.Those who are on the fence about this, think of this way.  If I asked you to get to the bottom of the stairs, what direction are you moving?  DOWN.  Down = Bottom.  That's logical, right?  So when looking at a piece of paper, if I wanted to go to the bottom of the page, I am reading DOWN the page. The analogy I stated before of \"move the paper up to read downwards\" works if my hands are directly on the paper.  But when I am not touching the paper, my eyes go down; the paper itself, say if laying on table, goes up.  That's why computer-based scrolling has worked for over two decades.  It's designed to work for your eyes, not for your hands.\"Natural scrolling\" makes perfect sense on an iPad, because you're \"touching the paper\" directly, thus you would move the paper so that you can get to the next parts of what you're reading.  I didn't find it to translate well on a disconnected input medium like the trackpad at all.  Your Mileage May Vary, but in my opinion it's more clunky than it's worth, and I would rather it had been disabled by default, with options for users who want to try that input type that are converts from the iPad.Lion wants to remember open tabs by default in Safari.  So let's say you have 3 tabs open and you shut the browser down because you're finished.  In my mind if I close all three tabs it's because I'm done using them and the next time I open the browser I expect a clean slate; otherwise I would just use bookmarks. In Lion, by default, when you open the browser multiple times, it will reopen whatever tabs you had open the last time you ran it.  Even Reset Safari does not stop this behavior.  You have to disable it in System Preferences if you don't want it.Lion has taken a questionable direction with regards to design strategy.  It feels very much like Apple's strategy was to create an OS that could be used on both a computer and a tablet, and I'd be shocked if we didn't see a Lion version of the iPad down the road.  The problem is a lot of the features just don't translate well to a computer environment at all, yet would feel right at home on a tablet.  Things like rotating and the new Mail interface.  I know some people have reported things as bugs with Lion...I don't think they are.  I think a lot of what we are experiencing are intentional changes...and anyone who thinks it's a bug, is really feeling the negative impacts of the changes.  Call a spade a spade.In summary...do I recommend it?  That's a big YES.  The 2011 Air is a solid machine that IMO is hindered somewhat by a questionable OS design.  The hardware is spot on and what the Air really should have been in the 2010 revision.  The backlight keyboard adds significant value to the Air, and the 2011 just feels right.  The base 13\" is a great value and well worth the money you spend on it.  It's not going to replace a Pro for many reasons.  But it's strong enough to be someone's primary if they really want it to be.  The review may sound like it's lower than a 4, but the more critical negatives are with Lion, not with the Air itself.  The Air itself is rock solid.  It's a strong VALUE and well worth the dollars you spend on it.  The higher end 13\" is pushing it in terms of true value, as is the low end 11\", but the high end 11\" and the base 13\" both are the best values in the Apple lineup right now.  The 13\" Pro has a stronger processor but not by much, and you must add a SSD to make it slightly superior to the base Air.  That's the way it should have been from the get-go.  VALUE, people.

So when it was time to upgrade the 'ol Lenovo, the first thing I did was go to the PC store in our mall and look at the new PC's.  And there are lots of really cool ones.  I really liked the Sony Viao in particular.  Then I went to the Apple store and looked at the Mac's...and there is no comparison in terms of the actual physical machine.  The Apple is just much, much better built.  I was still about 90% sure I'd go PC though, because it's the software I'm worried about.  But since I was still a month or so out from the buy, I started asking people who looked more like me (you know...boring), at Starbucks and elsewhere, what they thought of their Mac.  100% of them loved them.  100%.  As in every...single...person.  It was universal. People who just switched, people who switched a while back, and people who have had only Apple ALL loved them.  I couldn't find a single person to complain.So I bought one.  And I love it.  Everything about it.  The only error message I've gotten on my MAC is from, you guessed it, the ONE Microsoft program I run (Office for Mac, which actually works well).  So here's the deal: the Mac just works.  It does everything well, and it's very intuitive.  I had a friend who switched tell me \"if you can't figure out how to do something on your Mac, just sit back and think how a 10 year old would do it\".  And he was right.  I was trying to move a bunch of pictures and getting frustrated because holding down shift and selecting images wasn't working.  I sat back and thought about it, then instantly figured it out.  You just slide over the pictures you want.  That's it.  There's no ctrl/alt/shift/f5 crap on a Mac.  There are no \"This program performed an illegal operation and will shut down\" warnings. No \"Fatal exception occurred\" messages that make you freak out that your hard drive just crashed.  Nothing like that.  When I turn it on, it fires up in about 10 seconds, and re-loads everything that was running when I shut it down.  They tell me that's because of the flash memory, but I just know it's awesome.I set mine up with a second monitor (not the Apple one for $1,200, I bought a Samsung for cheap), and it's awesome, I can have different stuff running on both screens.  Took about 30 seconds to learn.I can honestly say the ONLY thing I like better on the PC is how you can Explore for files.  On the Mac its called the \"finder\", and it's not as good.  But that's it IMO.I use my computer for basic office stuff, no programming, no heavy graphics, no gaming.  For personal use, it's web surfing and pictures.  I can't speak for the heavier uses, but for an everyday guy who travels for work and is on the computer all day, this thing rocks.  If you are worried about memory, buy a USB drive, you can get one for next to nothing now.The Mac is tiny, fast, reliable, and has great battery life.

Luckily the Macbook Air 13\" beats my expectations on both fronts.This Macbook Air was clearly made for Mac OS 10.7 Lion.  Having used Lion on an older computer without one of Apple's new multi-touch trackpads, I originally thought it wasn't a very big upgrade, but this MacBook Air proved my original thoughts wrong.  It still retains all of the power of Snow Leopard, and adds some new functionality too, while making everything seem much more casual and personal.  Four finger swipes between spaces and full screen apps is the best way to go about a handful of tasks at once.  Mission Control can quickly organize the most cluttered workspace.  There are also tons of nice little features that really make the computing experience seem much more natural and refined.  Over time, you'll start spotting small differences that really make a big impact in usability like being able to zoom into webpages in safari, holding down a letter on the keyboard to bring up accents, and letting Quick Look run in the background.The immediacy and intimacy of apple's iOS operating system has been brought over, making simple tasks like checking email, browsing the web, or writing a document feel much less constricted.  All of these things, of course, get the benefit of a bigger screen and a full qwerty keyboard.My first thing that struck me about the computer physically was just how compact it was.  Even now, whenever I pick it up or plug in a cable, I'm surprised about how much they could fit in such a tiny body.  Of course, there are some sacrifices to make it this thin, but nothing that has really bothered me too much.  No optical disk drive (more on that later), no firewire, no HD FaceTime camera, no external battery indicator...  These are all things found on the MacBook Pro line, but are absent from the Air and aren't horribly missed.  One concession that might bug people is in the keyboard.  Although it's backlight (which is much more useful than it sounds), the travel of the keys in about half of that found in traditional MacBook keyboards.  It bugged me a bit at first, but after just a few days it wasn't really an issue anymore, but if you're still on the fence, it's one thing to keep in mind.One thing to note is that if you're looking for a day to day computer, the 11 inch macbook air will probably feel a bit claustrophobic to most.  The 13 inch screen is definitely a breath of fresh air for me because feels much larger than it actually is.  Having used a 13 inch white plastic macbook for the past 4 years, I expected the screen to be similar, but in use, it's vastly better.  Colors look brighter and blacks look deeper, but the big difference is in the display's pixel density.  The 13 inch Air ships with a 1440x900 resolution screen, matching the 15 inch macbook pro pixel for pixel, but at a smaller size.  This makes texts and graphics look much crisper.  I've found that the interface in general has much more room to breathe than on the 1280x800 resolution screen found on previous 13 inch MacBooks and the current line of 13 inch MacBook Pros.Someone looking for great connectivity features might want to look at the MacBook Pro line as the MacBook Air has only two USB ports, and SD Card Reader, Thunderbolt port, and auxiliary in/out.  However, I've been surprised at how little I really miss the CD Drive.  If you're already seriously considering this computer, it's omission shouldn't be too much of an issue, especially if you share files mostly through SD cards, flash drives, or emails.  Of course, a $79 Apple CD Drive can be purchased and plugged in if you really need it.  It's definitely a good idea to get one now if this is going to be your only computer, but since the world seems to be going further away from physical media towards downloads exclusively, I could see that CD drive collecting dust a few years down the road.  I'd also like to note that wifi performance has been stellar so far, being able to pick up a stronger signal in most places than my phone or previous computer.Inside in Air is 256gb of flash memory and a Core i5 ULV processor, making the computer feel quick and zippy.  After Effects and Illustrator, two extremely large and intensive applications, boot up with unbelievable speed.  If you're going to use this just for light tasks and small applications, this computer packs more speed and power than you'll ever need.  Even if you're into more intensive applications, you'll still be pleasantly surprised by the performance.  While it's clearly no super computer, anyone who casually likes to play with the Adobe Suite, even monsters in it like After Effects or Photoshop, won't be upset.  As expected, rendering takes a while, but any slowdowns you might encounter aren't enough, for me at least, to get frustrated with the computer.  I've yet to experience an app crash, even Adobe After Effects, which used to force quit every time I tried to close a composition on my old MacBook.The Air feels like an obvious extension of both the established Mac line as well as iOS. When I had an old baseline MacBook, I couldn't imagine living without an iPad for simple tasks, because the old computing experience was so restricted and confined, but after using the 13 inch air with all of its OS X Lion glory, I completely understand why people wouldn't want something between a computer and smartphone.  Using the MacBook Air is the first time I've felt as engrossed into a desktop interface as I have with an iPad.  Everything about it feels more fluid and comfortable than any other full computer I've ever used.  When Apple announced the new MacBook Airs and killed the white plastic MacBooks, I was really confused, but now I fully understand their actions.  The white plastic MacBooks were the cheapest computers they sold that could do everything the average consumer wanted.  People bought them because they could do a lot for less, but with the matching price point of the MacBook Airs, they suddenly have much less appeal.  The great specs and power of the MacBook Air prove Apple's commitment to quality across all levels as it takes the position as the cheapest MacBook.  The MacBook Air is the first computer I've used that does everything I need it to and disappears when I'm using it so I can focus on what I'm doing.  Overall, the MacBook Air is a strong choice for anyone looking for a computer to use day to day and maybe even for a bit of serious computing.  Although in the future, it might be reflected upon as a transitory device in the convergence of iOS and Mac OS, right now it feels like the perfect combination of the two.  It's both comfortable in use and powerful, making the entire experience feel \"just right.\"", "Date": "October 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "One laptop to RULE them all", "Author": "Albert Youn \"Technical Recruiter\"", "ReviewID": "R2B63CWTLEDSE8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hello, this review is about my preciousss...

In Windows 7, the fans can kick in when I have 2 Chrome windows open with about 12 tabs open, including espn.com.-- adjustable keyboard backlight.  I can type like 85 wpm and I infrequently look at the keyboard.  I like how I can turn off the keyboard backlight, or change its brightness between about 15 levels.Change requests:-- upgrade USB ports to the 3.0 standard-- that's about it for the hardware.  For the software, sure there are features and minor bugs that can get fixed in OSX.  But this review is mainly about the hardware, and it is nearly a flawless victory.SO... should I get THIS one, or the teeny tiny, cutsey wootsy 11 inch laptop?-- Dudes:  get the 13 inch laptop. Why?  the battery life and screen real estate (higher resolution)-- Ladies:  whatever you prefer.Summary:From the perspective of a salaried, college-educated guy who used Thinkpads for 10 years, I highly recommend getting this MacBook Air.  I give it a 5/5.  Everything works, and you can use Windows if you want to.  But give OSX at least 1 week, and I think that you'll see that it's far superior to Windows for everyday tasks.UPDATE, Oct. 10My friend who weighs about 165 lbs accidentally stepped on my Booq bag.  The dude stepped on the side that had my precious.  In my mind, I was like \"precoussss!\"  But it was during church service, and I waited until the end of service to check if there was any damage.  I opened the lid and saw that there was... no damage.HAHA, too bad clumsy foot!

Intel's Ivy Bridge HD4000 card is better and will probably come with the next version of this laptop.________________________This computer is built for a specific type of customer, so please make sure you fit the profile before buying it.Ask yourself these questions:1. Do you find yourself playing video games on your laptop?2. Do you use CPU-intensive programs such as iMovie or Handbreak?If your answers are yes, I strongly encourage you to but a 13' Macbook Pro. Alternatively, you can wait for next year's Ivy Bridge line of Macbook Airs, which will deliver better graphics.Now, if you work on your computer, if you go to college (like I do) and only need it to take notes, Skype, watch some videos, make documents and presentations and manage spreadsheets, this laptop is for you. I do encourage you to keep all your media on an external hard drive, because iTunes can fill up that 128 GB drive pretty fast.Pros:\u00b7 4 or 5 hours of battery use.\u00b7 Fast, because it uses a solid state hard drive instead of a normal disk one.\u00b7 OS X 10.7.2 is by far the most intuitive user interface I have graced my eyes upon.\u00b7 15' Macbook Pro resolution, meaning you have more pixels on a smaller screen, which is always great.\u00b7 It CAN run taxing programs, but don't expect the greatest performance.\u00b7 Trackpad and keyboard are the greatest I've seen.\u00b7 Great for programs like Evernote and Word.Cons:\u00b7 Heat, but you won't notice it that much, really.Final verdict:Make sure you are a person that won't find the graphic performance a hazard.I came from a Toshiba core i7 with 8GB of RAM and 512 of nVidia VRAm, and let me tell you that changing was the greatest idea I've had this whole year.", "Date": "December 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "GREAT SOUND, GREAT SPEED, GREAT DESIGN, AVERAGE BATTERY", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R11DUFKZ5VSIZM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The most beautiful thing about this laptop is obviously how thin it is. It weighs maybe 1.3 kgs but it feels like it weighs nothing. Now there's a lotta talk about how the iPad 3 is going to be. Imagine a 13 inch iPad with better speakers, a better screen, a 128GB SSD, a lotta ram and a wonderful back lit keyboard. That is the macbook air. I doubt I will need to upgrade to an iPad 3 just yet when I have the macbook air. I have stopped spending hours with my lovely iPad 2 since I got this beauty, beast and God itself.I have an iMac from 2010 which has a intel core 2 duo at 3.06 GHZ. My macbook air runs at 1.7GHZ but has an i5 dual core processor... What does this mean in terms of actual performance? Well the macbook air takes less than half a minute to load, I never quite shut it down cause when i'm not using it I simply close the lid and that's that.Using a software available for free called Wontube converter, I tried to see which computer converts a 700 mb avi file into an mp4 faster and the laptop did it in roughly 8 minutes where as the computer took 90 seconds more. I think that is phenomenal speed. It is also remarkable the amount of technology that goes into  making a puny machine faster than the desktop.They both cost the same amount so I would really struggle if I had to choose between one. I love the fact that I can carry the AIR wherever I go. Also 120GB was free when I first received it. That is wonderful because I thought it's gonna somewhere around 100 and a few gigs.I can open multiple applications but I'm a little cautious cause it has a direct impact on the battery.It is not seven hours, it never has ran more than four hours. The brightness of the laptop is not as bright as the Macbook pro. Correct me if I'm wrong but using it in anything less than full brightness is not recommended. I  can keep my desktop at 25% less than optimal brightness and function properly but the laptop... I wouldn't.CAMERA - The camera is not good. I wouldn't use it for photo booth and clicking photographs, they appear grainy. My 2007 Dell Inspiron notebook has a better camera.SPEAKERS - Very good loud sound. A little louder than the iPad actually. They are very clear, the headphone jack is situated on the left but I wish it was on the right because if I'm using that and the usb port and the charger all at the same time it gets a little crowded. Anyway, the earphone speaker volume on max isn't that loud.WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY - So far not a single problem. The wireless is very finely tuned I find. It is super active and restless but not once has it given me the slightest hint of an issue at obtaining a signal.BATTERY LIFE - Advertized is seven hours, the maximum I ever get out of it is 180 minutes to about a max of 200 minutes or so.BLUETOOTH - Apple makes for a great generic inbuilt bluetooth and in a matter of a couple of minutes I had my android hooked to this computer and was transferring mp3s to and fro.iTunes - I recently enrolled in Itunes match and this ensures that even a laptop with just 128gigs of HDD has all my music on the go. A downside of itunes match is the fact that it downloads the song before actually streaming it but hey I can live with it when I have a 25k song limit on iTunes match's icloud.Keyboard - It is not a perfect keyboard, the lights seem a little cheesy when they are backlit to about 50%.Weight - Hardly any weight at all and I can hold for it for hours without getting tired. Weighs much less than my ASUS U35F-X1 Thin...let's say it weighs a feather over 2 iPad 2'sPortability - The Macbook Air 13 doesnt heat up like almost all of the Windows laptops I have ever used. Because it doesn't have an optical drive helps the cause but it remains a cool customer  all the time unless I am doing something processor intensive like converting video. But I gotta give it to Apple because their laptops NEVER HEAT.Lion seems to work better on my laptop than on my desktop. One reason for this could be the fact that I upgraded from Snow Leopard to Lion but nonetheless the desktop is substantially slower (thinking of a clean install..)I use TEXTEDIT for notepad because Apple doesn't have a native notepad.The trackpad is flawless. It is better than any laptop I have ever used.FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NEVER OWNED AN APPLE NOTEBOOK -Let me explain a few things that make an apple laptop stand out from the others.1. No heat on your lap irrespective of what application you're running, it seems cool, the chassis never heats up like numerous laptops I've had in the past2. It's much lighter, Lion loads much faster on the macbook air than any other operating system I have seen load on any other machine I have used3. The magnet end of the charger easily attaches into the charging port on the mac, there is an AMBER light that displays itself when it's charging and it turns GREEN when the Mac has been completely charged.4. Setting up a macbook is easy, Apple doesn't load any bloatware because somehow this company manages to make everything seem genuine and intuitive for software as well. For example, the applications that I never used before like LAUNCH PAD etc seem more convincing on the Macbook Air than any other application a laptop pc manufacturer has loaded on their machines.5. Portability is divine. I do need a great perfect carrying solution though recommendations would be welcome. I do like sleeves but am open to any suggestion as to what others use.6. The screen resolution is optimized, I doubt you will ever change it, the icon spacing is beautiful, the track pad has various shortcuts, go to a store displaying this laptop and tell me you've seen a better looking computer. Watching a youtube video is a fantastic experience because 1080P truly pops out and there is a certain flow of programs which other computers don't have7. 2 USB outlets let you attach extra devices such as optical drive, external hard drive but I wish the HDMI port was something simpler and less \"Apple'ized\" ... Good luck finding a HDMI cable in India.CONS -The macbook air doesn't have the advertized battery life. I wish it lasted as long as a macbook pro. I hate having to close applications to save the battery. Also decreasing the brightness on this type of a screen makes it dull.  The Macbook pro can take more of a decrease in brightness than this machine can. When you turn the keyboard light all the way back, there is some light that escapes from the bottom and it makes your laptop look a little robotic. Certain businesses don't allow widescale access to INTRANET on wireless and asking for a wireless password is considered almost rude. This makes the absence of the Ethernet port a bit of a debby downer. Yes, you can buy an add on but still...WHY IT HOLDS UP AGAINST THE MACBOOK PRO -1. I don't really need an optical drive, I have a desktop Apple but if this is your only computer then I would consider the macbook pro or maybe an external USB optical drive (sounds odd to me honestly)2. The solid state drive and the i5 are both plenty fast. The boot up time for both machines is the same.3. The track pad, the keyboard, the overall feel is same on both except the macbook pro is heavier4. The macbook pro has a much better outlandish battery life so if that is of a lot of concern I would recommend the 15 inch oddity cause it's beautiful.I have previously owned notebooks by Compaq (running XP) Dell (running Vista and later Windows 7) and I also have an Asus U35F-X1 Thin running Windows 7. The Apple seems to beat them in terms of portability, design, size, performance, etc. I envision greater integration between Apple's operating system for their mobile devices such as iPad, iPhone, iPod (iOS) and their operating system for the desktops and notebooks (Currently Lion) in the future and it only seems believable that the Air will support those formats for a few more years. So the chances of this becoming obsolete are slim. I don't think this is that expensive especially considering just how much of a marvel the machine is. I love browsing the web on it but I need to further probe into keyboard shortcuts. I'm more aware of PC shortcuts than I am of MAC.**UPDATED 03/16**PS - When you connect an HDMI to this laptop using a converter, to transfer the image from the mac to the TV screen simply hold down \"Command\" and press \"F1\" - this basically duplicates your image to the tv screen. HDMI works pretty good.", "Date": "February 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Too Fragile - UPDATE - Solution!", "Author": "Minnus", "ReviewID": "R1G7R0QZ5RBR6P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE---(on bottom)Conceptually and on paper, this machine is awesome. After using it for about a month or so, it was still awesome. It is very snappy, and the trackpad is amazing compared to any other trackpad I have used. The display is not perfect (gradient mountains near the edge of the screen due to varying 'tightness' of the bezel), but decent for being on a laptop. They keyboard is backlight, adding value during use at night. Overall, it has been good computing experience.It stopped being awesome though, after I used it for what it is designed to be - portable. If you search on your favorite search engine \"2011 MBA - Faint lines\", it will be your first hit. If anything presses against the lid of the MBA while closed for an extended period of time, the keyboard will press against the screen - imprinting onto the LCD. This is a common occurrence for those who use a laptop...like a laptop and is honestly unacceptable. After bringing it to the genius bar, a suggestion provided to me is to simply use a hard cover case such that the pressure is applied to the case instead of the MBA lid. While an excellent suggestion, it undermines the purpose of the form factor of the MacBook Air - namely, portability from being extremely lightweight and thin. To travel without without fear, I would have to double the weight and quadruple the thickness.For those travelers out there - this is my warning, and may I also add that my ThinkPad 120xe and Alienware M11X never suffered damage due to being transported.Edit: If you're wondering whether or not this screen issue is a just cause for 1 star - it is. The screen heavily impacts the enjoyability of using the product. If it was just a matter of having a poor quality screen (such as one with very poor color replication), then the rating would have been based on how important I felt screen quality was. However, this is something entirely different - the screen is damaged during what I would consider to be normal and practical usage. As such, it is a design flaw that cripples the entire experience. I will attempt to find and upload a picture of related damage.UPDATE -- (Copy and paste of my review for the Razer Kabuto Screen Protector/Mousepad - refer to the product for a full review, I only copied comments relevant to the MBA)<review for the Kabuto>At first, I was told by the Apple Genius Bar technicians that placing something between the screen and the body would only reduce the clearance, and would do nothing to help with the issue. I decided that it certainly would not hurt (more) - and might even help distribute the pressure a little more evenly across the screen. Worse case,  /wave <$20.To my surprise, the cloth has work VERY well. Since I've used it, the white line issue is practically nonexistent.Now, to review the product:Pros - Thin! - but not TOO thin. I was certainly aware of the thickness of this cloth before I bought it. I chose this one over other (more popular / common) brands because this cloth adds the additional functionality of a mousepad (others are just cloths - I did find one that was a cloth, and a mousepad  - but that one was a tad too thick for the MBA - first hand experience - Everki). It was also 'slightly' thicker. I valued the thickness because I sought to provide more of a 'cushion' between the screen and the body. I deemed other cloths TOO thin.....DISCLAIMER - the fit within the MBA is not a 'perfect' fit. Meaning the lid does not close entirely (it is not a giant gap - but definitely a noticeable one if you care). If you want a cloth that closes entirely, you would want a thinner cloth (Shaggymac, Radtech). For me, the cushion was a requirement - a super thin cloth, in my opinion (it could be completely wrong!), could not protect as well as this cloth.</end of review>WITH this product, I would raise my rating to around 4 ish stars. Unfortunately, the Macbook Air does NOT come with a screen protector cloth, and will be leaving my reviewing of 1 star as a WARNING that a screen protector cloth is NEED - not to prevent scratches (with is the obvious reason why one would want screen protection), but to prevent the 'faint white line.'Good luck!", "Date": "December 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "As a college computer science student, this is fantastic.", "Author": "Omar Diab \"Sebastian\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q810YH4R6PYZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a computer scientist who spends a lot of time programming and cares about both the functional and aesthetic qualities of my electronics, the ultrabook craze as of late has excited me a lot. The fact that I have used PCs almost exclusively for the last 12 years initially lead me away from considering a MacBook Air--after all, Apple's computers are expensive; they do have a reputation for all looking the same, acting the same, and being generally uncustomizable; and they have had a reputation for being incompatible with a lot of software out there.  But I found myself in a position where I want a secondary computer that is small, light, attractive, and dedicated for light use, like text editing/coding and recreation.  As it turns out, Apple has done something with this laptop that I never thought I'd dream of.The Macbook Air--*gasp*--is price competitive with its competition.Most comprable Windows ultrabooks, like the ASUS Zenbook UX31E-DH72 13.3-Inch Thin and Light Ultrabook (Silver Aluminum), right now are often only about $100-$200 or so cheaper than the Macbook Air now.  I think that there are many things that the Macbook Air brings to the table that make the premium worthwhile. This review is not going to focus much on the actual specs of the laptop, as you can glean that from any of the 90 5-star reviews this laptop has at the moment.  I will focus instead on why this is great against the competition.1) The user experience is fantastic. The trackpad alone could win me over for this one. For some reason, other laptop manufacturers can't get multitouch gesturing right, but Apple clearly put a ton of effort into something so overlooked--but so constantly used--as the trackpad.  Multitouch gesturing on Lion is just the best you'll find on any computer anywhere. It feels natural and makes navigating your computer effortless. Even ignoring that, I've rarely seen any hiccups while using the laptop in terms of things freezing up or the computer becoming unresponsive. While I do love Windows 7, the benefits of Apple's closed in environment is that they can control everything about the user experience, and so slowdowns and UI problems become a rarity. You really can presume that nearly everything's going to work right. Finally, all the components seem very solidly built. The keyboard has great tactile feedback, and the port selection, while limited, all works perfectly. The hinge of the laptop even clearly was thought about, as the resistance is pretty much ideal (no wobbling, but not difficult to move around). The screen resolution (1440x900)--while not as good as the Asus Zenbook--is better than most of the rest of the competition, and that's something that's important to me as a software developer since I like to be able to read documentation and type out code at the same time, a feat difficult on a low-resolution screen.2) The customer service is also great. AppleCare has a great reputation, and you get it for a year for free. I've used ASUS support before, and it's really, really annoying to have to wait a month without your laptop for service. There really isn't much comparison.3) As a software developer, I find it irking that Apple forces iOS developers to code on a Mac with a subscription fee to the SDK. But that's the nature of the beast--so having this laptop gives me the ability to do just that. Sure, it seems unfair and maybe I ought not develop for iOS because of the many subversive choices Apple made, but hey--it's not up to me, and it's easier and more stable than making my laptop into a Hackintosh, so I guess I'll play the game :PAnd finally, there are some complaints about heat. Using the laptop on your lap does make your legs feel pretty warm. I haven't had the laptop crash due to heat ever, though. It is to be expected, though, since the metal chassis is part of the laptop's cooling system, though I hope that in future revisions of the macbook they come up with a good way to avoid this issue.There's one other laptop that I haven't taken into consideration that in retrospect I wish I considered more seriously. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 (129126U) 13.3\" LED Notebook - Core i5 i5-2520M 2.50GHz - 4G DDR3 320G HDD (Windows 7 Professional) - Black is a pretty good, and overlooked, ultrabook that seems like a great alternative, especially considering that you can get an extended battery that brings the battery life of that beast to an inhumane 22 hours or so while still being pretty small and light.  If you're looking into high-end ultrabooks, I'd limit my search to the Macbook Air, the Asus Zenbook, or the Thinkpad X1 at this point (the Sony VAIO VPC-Z212GX/B 13.1-Inch Laptop (Black) is very cool too, but also too expensive for me to take seriously). Also, you may want to wait for the near future when one of two things happens: a) the new Intel \"Ivy Bridge\" chips come out, as this may make laptops have even better performance and battery life; and b) Windows 8 comes out--I think that Microsoft's latest revision to their OS may have the potential for changing things big time in the market, so unless you feel good about Apple as it stands, I would consider waiting for that to come along.Hopefully this review will help some of you in the search for the latest and coolest laptops around :) Let the best manufacturer/operating system win!", "Date": "February 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "WOW- just amazing.", "Author": "Ryan H. Smith", "ReviewID": "R2O74X4FL6W96C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have traditionally been a 13\" Macbook Pro user since they have been the most fully outfitted laptops in Apple's line-up. When the AIr came out a few years ago, I remember thinking that I really liked the idea of an ultra portable, but was worried about the lost functionality that came along with it (ethernet port, fire wires, optical drive). Since then my usage has changed a lot. I print and connect to the internet wirelessly, so the ethernet port does not matter anymore. All of my software is downloaded (legally of course) and I have not needed to burn a CD or DVD in 3-4 years, thus the optical drive issue is gone. This latter point matters because I use flash drives to move large files and anything up to 15MB I just e-mail. Port issues aside, there is a lot to recommend the Air over a 13\" Pro. The air's screen is less reflective and higher resolution. To my eyes it's just better. The air is light. I never thought a 13\" Pro was heavy until I used an Air for a bit. The Air is faster in day-to-day usage than the 13\" pro. Both use i5 processors, the same GPU and have 4GB of RAM. The kicker is the flash-based drive in the AIr is WAAAAY faster than the regular HD int he 13\" Pro. Side by side, I think the air is the way to go. If you really must have an optical drive, you can sync the Air up to another Mac and use its drive or Apple sells one for $80, but before you buy one, try the Air on its own and you might just be surprised about how well you get along without it. Note: The 15 an 17 inch Pro have much more sophisticated graphics processing and for those needing the extra GPU power, neither the Air nor the 13\" Pro is the best choice.

I had never considered a Mac previously and always considered them to be nothing but overpriced PC's in a shiny case built and designed for computer illiterate individuals seeking a point-and-click appliance. How could I have been so wrong?This laptop is simply the best product I've ever purchased, period. My head, being in the PC world, couldn't even comprehend how elegant and wonderful this laptop could possibly be. I had no frame of reference for a \"GREAT product\" because, coming from the PC world, I had never experienced that. EVERY laptop I have previously owned or used had something that was sub-par. Sure, 90% of other laptops are good, but they always leave something to be desired. For instance the track pad might be finicky, or the keyboard design may be sub-par, or the built-in speakers aren't loud enough, or the machine is heavy, or noisy, etc. There is nothing sub-par on this machine.- The thing is as light as a feather- Battery lasts 7hrs- Battery charges quickly- Track pad is the best thing I've ever used- Keyboard is shockingly usable and prevents errors, it's a joy to type on- Screen is bright, vibrant, and beautiful- It doesn't get hot- I never hear any fans or anything... maybe 2x's since I've gotten it has it used it's fans- Web cam is great, high res, and works flawlessly- Speakers sound great- Even the power cord is brilliantly designed... and that's just the hardware.OSX, being now based on UNIX, is a dream come true. It makes doing every-day computer tasks a breeze and as simple as point and click. BUT, never fear, you have the full power of UNIX under the hood so if you want to get deep, you absolutely can. I had wrongly ASSumed that OSX was for dummies. Again, I couldn't be more wrong. Within hours I had my macports repository set up and was sucking down Nmap, GTK+, and all sorts of things I would do on my Ubuntu box. I was running Python scripts, writing scripts, running ifconfig... it was great!Oh, so then I decided to fire up Eclipse and try debugging some Android code. After installing Eclipse I tried to fire it up and when I did it complained about not having a Java SDK installed. \"Great, let the nightmare begin\", I thought to myself. Not so fast! My Mac popped up a window that said, \"Oh, hai! I see you don't have the proper Java SDK to run Eclipse, lemme go get that ish for you, cool?\". Stunned, I pressed OK, and it went out, got the proper SDK, installed it, and re-launched Eclipse all ready to do. Let me just say the Eclipse install on a PC is... shall I say, slightly more involved.I grabbed my Galaxy S phone, plugged it into my laptop and VIOLA! It just worked! No endless driver installations, no driver conflicts, etc. It was great. So then, just for kicks, I unplugged my Galaxy S, plugged in my Galaxy Nexus and guess what? No drivers necessary, it just worked! Amazing.Another thing that surprised me about OSX was the apps. Everything about them. They are abundant, beautiful, and feature rich. Many of the cross platform apps such as Skype are far superior on the Mac. Not to mention that the apps that aren't free, such as Keynote (Apple's version of PowerPoint), are dirt cheap. Keynote was $19.99 and in my brief experience of crafting a 30 minute slide presentation, far superior to PowerPoint.I've seen the light. Trust me, I didn't want to, but it's impossible to ignore.

I have owned the product for about two weeks.I will try to avoid repeating what has already been said in many of the other reviews for the Macbook Air and offer you my own perspective and decision-making process before the purchase and thoughts after the purchase.Before I purchased...I have been a long time Windows OS user and really the only Apple product I owned up until this purchase was my iPhone4. I had plenty of desktops at home and work, but I needed a new personal laptop I could take with me when I'm on the go. I would like to think I'm in the majority when it comes to having a very usable laptop that's also portable. It doesn't need to do intense gaming, it doesn't need the best graphics card out there, but it DOES need to be light and it DOES need to do daily tasks well.I researched...I certainly wasn't in the Apple camp just yet and looked at several notebooks from HP, Samsung, Toshiba, Lenovo. I looked at all notebooks, but something about the thin and light ones just really caught my attention. I wanted to be careful though because in the world of technology there are always trade offs. To my relief it appeared that the thin and light notebooks out in the market had all gotten to a point where they were now very capable machines. They were certainly not up to the performance of their thicker brethren, but they were now considered very usable with a price premium that was still within budget. (See the complaints about the first generation thin notebookes like the original Macbook Air if you want to know more about some downsides).Thin and light...The final contenders in the running were the Samsung 9, the Lenovo X1, and this Macbook Air. If you looked at price and performance they're on a level playing field. As the typical consumer though we tend to evaluate beyond just the speeds and feeds. It came down to aesthetics and feeling around the brand. Long story short, Apple won. The OS was not an issue for me because there are several ways you can set your Macbook up to run Windows.The kicker...I would be traveling internationally and Apple clearly offers an international warranty. You can take them to any Apple store to get them fixed. It was not clear what kind of \"limited\" international warranty were being offered by other manufacturers. I have noticed international warranties are usually NOT standard on typical consumer PCs. Business PCs are another story.After I purchased...Everything works well and the notebook is as speedy as everyone says. There are certainly little things I noticed here after I got this computer.I did try some light 3D gaming and the laptop would get hot especially near the upper part of the keyboard.The large trackpad is easy to use and the surface is a very nice anti-friction material. You would be surprised how many laptop manufacturers get the trackpad surface wrong. The ability for it to recognize a finger vs. your palm resting on it while typing on the keyboard is one of those little features many don't notice.The magsafe adapter is a great design and still beats the traditional plug-in power because there is no harm down if you accidentally pull it out by say tripping over the wire.The power adapter is tiny and doesn't get warm. It also comes with an interchangeable extension cord if the default cord is too short for you.OS X Lion has taken some time to get used to, but it wasn't terrible. I did not end up installing Windows :).The one thing I have NOT liked about the Macbook Air though is that for some reason the notebook screen puts more stress on my eyes than other screens. I can not pinpoint exactly why, but it happens.Conclusion: I gave it 4 stars because I have only had it for a few weeks, but if this notebook lasts me past the warranty period it deserves a at least a 4.5 rating.", "Date": "October 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simply amazing!

As of the purchase of this item I had the 2011 13 inch MB Pro with their 2.8 GHz processor, plus the 2010 27 inch iMac.  Both have memory and HD upgrades.  With this in place, let me get into details:1. Fit and finish, weight, look and feel - Without a doubt this is simply put the best laptop Apple has gotten out in this sense, period.  The machine is significantly lighter than a MacBook Pro, which is a plus being a frequent flier and having to put this on my shoulder along with various cables, an iPad, an iPod and small documents.  The look is all Apple, brushed aluminum with the light up Apple in the middle...  The only down side I've found to Apple's laptops is that they do dent quite easily.  I found this out the hard way since with my previous MB Pro I left the internal zipper in my laptop case not fully closed, and the pressure with alot of documents inside literally made a small ding on my top cover (backside of the screen).  Unfortunately no spare parts to replace this, and repairing would've meant replacing the entire top panel (including the LCD screen) for over $800.2. Features - Again, this machine gets top marks, but does have its drawbacks.  Firstly, the 2011 Airs now have backlit keyboards (again) which is a plus if you work in low light conditions (in my case, on a plane at night).  The computer includes an HD webcam (Facetime camera) which again if you travel and a friend or loved one has one of the more recent Macs or iDevices (iPhone 4, iPad2) you can do videocalls using Apple's facetime feature at no cost and with minimal setup.  Display is not edge to edge like on Macbook Pros, which is a bummer, but it's not noticable if you're coming from another Air or a Windows PC.  As to connectivity, computer has an SD card slot, a Thunderbolt port and 2 USB 2.0 inputs...  And that's it.  This means that everything you have to connect will basically be via a USB.  Therefore, if you need a wired network connection, buy an adapter and take up a USB port...  Need to read a CD or DVD, buy an external Superdrive and connect to a USB port...  This means that you will surely have to purchase a USB hub (if you use external drives you will surely have to purchase a powered hub), so all of this eventually adds up in price.3. OS - For those which use Snow Leopard, Lion is definitely an important step forward in the right direction.  If you don't but already use an iPod touch, iPhone or iPad, many things will seem familiar.  Lion now uses gestures, which basically allows you to use multiple fingers to swipe or move in a direction on your trackpad to do certain items.  I won't go into great detail here but items such as Mission Control and Launchpad are definitely impressive and very user friendly, although many hardcore users will not find themselves using it too much.4. Performance - OK, here's where I leave the best for last.  To be honest, I'm reviewing my Macbook Air I purchased for my wife, since my original plans were not to \"downgrade\" to the air from a Macbook Pro.  For those of you who don't know, Airs use SSD drives.  In short, this means they are enormous USB pen drives.  The result of this is much lower power consumption, no need to power off the computer when moving it (SSD's have no moving parts, so there's no risk of damaging your hard drive due to motion shock) and the two most important things... very little probability of data loss due to hard drive failure and IMPRESSIVE SPEED!  Although the Air has a lower processor speed than the Pro, the SSD more than makes up for this for common tasks (combined with Lion's efficiency).  From the time I press the power button on the laptop to the moment I get my logon screen... 8 seconds!  To the moment I type in my logon credential to the time the computer is ready to go (with all background processes loaded including antiviruses and indexing programs) 5 seconds!!  I use the Air for virtualization (running windows within my Mac OS) and it is quite fast and responsive for basic tasks, and I also use it for some minor flash animation and other general tasks, and the computer has not disappointed at all.  The only part I have specifically seen a drop in performance versus the Pro is when working with video, such as converting files from one format to another to sync with my iPad.  Otherwise stellar marks.5. Upgradability - Unfortunately, here the Air gets a failing grade.  Basically how you buy the maching is how you will have it.  No options to upgrade RAM or HD (soldered to the motherboard and in the case of the SSD it's an Apple proprietary design) so this has made me have to be creative in cleaning out all of my \"non frequently used files\" off my laptop since the HD maxes out at 256 GB.  An external HD is a must for photos, movies and music if you have a decent sized collection.So in short, after working a couple of days with my wife's air, I was so impressed that I sold my Pro and purchased one for myself.  Although I don't do my heaviest work on it (I have my iMac for that) it is spectacular for everyday office use and even some heavier than usual lifting...  Definitely something worth buying!", "Date": "August 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Apple finally got it right...", "Author": "R. Chen \"wahoodude23\"", "ReviewID": "RVHO5MN6QEXLQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally took the plunge and bought a Mac. Been waiting for the updated MBA and now that it's out, it does not disappoint. I will not get into reiterating features but instead just make a few observations from the perspective of a 20 year PC user who just bought his first Mac today.1) Been using it about 4 hours straight on my lap and doesn't generate nearly the same heat as a Windows laptop. Makes me wonder where all the heat IS going though....2) New gestures and trackpad features on scroll pad are extremely intuitive. I did make one change from default which was to make the bottom right the secondary click. Especially love the 4 finger up-scroll for the dashboard and mission control. Really eliminates the need for a mouse. And Natural Scrolling takes about 15 min to get used to... honestly.3) A previous reviewer wrote that the graphics don't \"pop\" off the screen and I tend to agree. Even though resolution is increased, was expecting a little more. I think the biggest problem is with the text - doesn't seem clear in some settings. I sure hope Apple has an update for this. On the good side, the new 1440 x 900 resolution is wonderful. Not quite 16 x 9 ratio but pretty darn close and you get a ton of text to fit on the screen.4) This laptop really does feel unbelievably thin and light. We know the specs but when its in your hands, its a different story and Apple hit the mark here.5) SSD drive is instant on and super fast. This boots up and wakes faster than any computer I've ever owned by a LONG shot (I boot up in less than 10 seconds). 128 GB is more than enough for everyday use IMO. Buy an external drive if you need more. The 128GB 13\" model is the best value IMO.6) Viewing angles great side to side not so great vertically, but not too relevant anyway on a laptop IMO.7) A little surprised that we didn't get an HD FaceTime camera but just SD. I guess sacrifices had to be made somewhere to keep the price point - we got so many other upgrades so not complaining too much about this one, just an observation.8) This computer can be your primary IMO - its got all the right features and is now just as powerful as the MB Pro.All in all - Apple did a great job and finally created a MBA that is for the masses and will satisfy the masses. This notebook is the PC killer.... at least it was for me.Update 8/2: Now that I've been using this for a week, the fan does get a little louder if doing high processing requirement tasks like streaming video.

It has really clean, minimalist design that looks aesthetically pleasing. I also love the aluminum unibody. And the backlit keyboard is not only useful but also visually pleasing.- Screen: While not the retina display found in iPhone and iPad (the new one), I'm overall happy and impressed with the Air's clear and crisp screen quality.- Weight: Ultra-thin and really light. What more can I say? :)- Snappy: this is the fastest and the most responsive laptop I've ever used. It boots in like 5 seconds (unlike my previous samsung laptop that took literally at least 3 minutes to finish booting). It opens applications almost instantaneously. The internet experience is just as snappy. No more waiting!- Battery life: I'm sure the battery life depends on individual's usages, but based on my experience, the Air lasts me at least 6 hours, sometimes 7. I mostly use the Air for writing and modifying documents using Word, using Safari for web browsing, watching videos and listening to music via iTunes. However, the battery life seems to deteriorate when using Skype.- General usability: This is my first Apple laptop, so at first I didn't know what to expect. I did need to adapt somewhat because mac OS is different from Windows. But after a week of use, the general experience of using the Air has been outstanding. There's hardly any freezes. Everything just goes smoothly and seamlessly.What could be improved:- Heat: the heat and fan noise hasn't been a problem for me, but I did witness that when I'm using certain applications like Skype or Handbrake, the Air did get noticeably warm and the fans kicked in.  However, in most circumstances, not much complaint here, but I still thought  I would mention this.Conclusion: this is a really well-built laptop. I got 256GB i5 Air, and this is the best laptop I've ever used so far. As long as you're not a heavy user who needs to run power-consuming programs, this laptop should be perfect for every-day user. Also being a college student myself, I definitely recommend Air to other students because it is light, really portable without breaking your back with already heavy backpack, great battery life, and outstanding overall usability.

The second laptop I got was an HP Envy 13, after my first laptop I just wanted something that I didn't need to have plugged in after 2-3 hours of use, or in other words ONE class. The envy did not fulfill this at all (there's a reason they called it a macbook clone). So after the first revision of the macbook I decided okay lets try this out. WOW! not only did it last me more than one class without charging, I was able to get through THREE 2 hour classes without charging AND still have about 50% battery life. Keep in mind I would tweek my settings to get those results (low brightness, minimal browser use, MS word or excel open the whole time). My only complaint was that the first revision was a bit sluggish and it could be felt when I would have multiple browser windows open. The second revision (2011) took care of this one complaint I had, while still not as speedy as a top of the line desktop, you have to keep in mind that you need to make some concession for portability. Its thin, its fast, the flash hard drive is zippy.

The 2010 version has a Core 2 duo processor with an NVIDIA graphics card embedded. The 2011 version has an i5 processor (Sandy Bridge) but Intel integrated graphics (to be clear, the model being reviewed here). Both laptops have 4GB of memory and 256GB hard drives. The 2010 version, which I personally carry, is the best laptop I have ever owned. The solid state drive makes it more than fast enough for everything I do. Even running Windows 7 in vmware is fast enough to not be bothered by the virtualization. I love that laptop.This 2011 version we bought for my wife. This laptop is even faster but the graphics is inferior. I play Starcraft with my son and the 2011 Macbook air is a step backwards from the 2010 version in terms of performance in that game. Sure it works, but it's not as fun. it's glitchy. In fact, it seems more glitchy than a 3 yr old Macbook with older integrated graphics.This is not really a revelation as many blogs have pointed out that the 3D graphics in the 2011 version are a step backwards from the 2010 version. But unfortunately, while the 2010 version had adequate graphics and CPU performance, the 2011 version has inadequate graphics performance and more than adequate CPU performance. I would not be happy with this laptop. My wife on the other hand, loves it. She does not game so if Excel opens a microsecond faster or a web page renders more quickly, it's a pure win for her.In my opinion, if you care about 3D graphics performance, you might be better off with a used 2010 Macbook air.

I say almost because it doesn't have everything.

You could get a more powerful Wintel laptop for half the money.  I realize that is sacrilege to MAC OS guru's.  But the fact is as easy and solid as apple tries to make OS X and MAC hardware they both still have some issues.- Both versions of the mac air I use and a MAC pro I also use constantly drop WIFI.  While non-mac laptops attached to the same WAP do not drop.  The frustrating thing is the apple goes out of their way to hide all of the real advanced settings that may actually fix the issue.  I understand they want to make these things like a toaster and thats fine, but some time you need to open the \"hood\" and fiddle with the \"engine\".  OS X is based on a UNIX variant and I have been working on various UNIX flavors for 16 years, I am no stranger to UNIX OS's.  But even at the CLI level they hide many of the advanced tools that one could use if one should run into an issue.  Of course you can pack the thing up and take it to the genius bar, which may cost you money.BTW in windows or linux you are able to get to the advanced settings easily enough if needed.-  As much as I don't love windows because of its instability, make no mistake OS X is not immune.  While it is overall more stable than windows 7 it does have its moments of instability.  Run it too hard or open too many windows it can freeze or hang.  Matter of fact I notice when I run the airs and the pro hard I see bluetooth devices loose connectivity, especially the mouse, and the only way to get it back is to reboot.  Wait I thought windows only did that, well OS X does too unfortunately, albeit not as much.- OSX still is safer than windows as far as viruses go, but that is because there are more virus written for windows.  IT is not because OS X is immune.  Purchasing virus software is a good idea.-  Software is still kind of limited for the Mac, and the ones that are available are usually pricy.  Sometimes I just want to play a game, but most of the good ones run on windows.  If you are not  a gamer or power user and just want something to surf the net why pay the big bucks when you can get a Acer for under $400.I can ramble all day with the comparisons but end of the day the Mac air is a cool device and sleek but I wouldn't dole out my money for it.", "Date": "January 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent replacement for MBP 13.3\"", "Author": "Paul C.

Mine has the 256GB SSD, a $300 upgrade over the base model.  Some are comparing this laptop to the 11\" MBA.  However, for many, the 13\" MBA is now powerful enough to be considered a replacement for bigger Macbook Pro Computers. Rather, it's about how well I think this computer will address my needs.  If your needs (computing and travel) are similar to mine, you might find my impressions useful. I won't discuss performance.  I don't run benchmarks, and the benchmarks I've seen so far show that this computer is much, much faster than my nearly 4-year-old MBP, which is my most important performance requirement.Based on my initial impressions, I say that the reasons to purchase a MBP instead of a MBA have been reduced drastically.  These reasons include*Needing the most powerful laptop available (a desktop replacement)*Running programs that need/can use more than 4GB of RAM*Needing greater storage (SSD chips get real expensive real fast)*Wanting or needing a 15 or 17\" screen.*Needing a greater variety and number of IO portsFirst, a little about me so that you can determine whether my computing needs are similar enough to yours.  My needs and desires for a laptop include being able to take it on the road with me and duplicate much of what I do in my office on trips lasting from one day to two-weeks. I, therefore, eliminated the 11\" MBA because its screen is simply too small for use as a primary computer for more than a day or two.  I need to be able to remote connect to my office computer and sync daily using Dropbox and Sugarsync.  My most used programs are Safari, email (I use Thunderbird but will consider transitioning to Apple Mail in Lion), MS Office (Word, Excel and Powerpoint), and for my photography addiction, Lightroom and Photoshop. So, I do not engage in heavy lifting in my computer use.  The 256GB seems like an excellent storage compromise.  My old laptop had 250GB of storage and that proved adequate, and I have no doubt that this will still be the case.  I found that for the type of computing I do, having a fast SSD enhances the usage experience far more than a faster processor.  I had a fast SSD installed into my 2010 iMac.  The iMac was far faster than the Mac Pro that I use at work which doesn't have an SSD.  Of course, this assertion would not be true if I edited video or ran elaborate statistical analysis etc.As for size, the MBA's surface area is pretty big, but it's much smaller than the 15\" that it replaces. The thickness--or rather, thinness--of this machine is amazing. For me, next to a current generation MBP the rear at .68\" is noticeably and significantly smaller than the .95\" of the MBP. More importantly, the width rapidly decreases in size down to .11\".  This laptop will go anywhere.  I will have no problem stuffing it into any bag I have or sliding it into the magazine pouch in the back of the airplane seat in front of me.  As suspected, the wedge shape facilitates putting this laptop  in many tight places.  What I didn't realize, was that it is just so super thin throughout, that stuffing this laptop into tight places will rarely be a problem. I live in a medium-size town with a small airport served by small jets. In the past, if I wanted to put my overstuffed bag in the small overhead bin, I invariably had to remove my MBP. I have no doubt that that will be much less of a problem with this laptop. In, fact I will get more space by removing a book, magazine or report from my bag. It will also be less of a hassle removing and reinserting the MBA in my bag when going through airport security.  Thus, I suspect that I will value the size relative to larger laptops more so than the weight difference.On the weight, this bad boy is heavier than expected.  I guess I've gotten used to carrying around an iPad. I'm no body builder, but I'm in pretty good shape.  I still bench press 140lbs and backpack with a 30lb load. Nonetheless, 3lbs is above the \"I don't think about it, just take it with me all the time\" weight. I haven't picked up the 11\", so it is hard to imagine that the 1/2 lb would make much difference. But as someone else who had both the 11 and 13 said, they found that they took the 11\" with them more often than they took the 13\", so even small differences in weight matter. Suffice it to say, I'm glad it's not any heavier. Clearly, the 1.5 lb difference between this MBA and the smallest Macbook Pro is not something that I want to consider. The MBP's added weight just creates an additional reason to think about whether to take it with you, which in my mind defeats the purpose of portable computing.The screen is excellent. It's very clear. One feature that I hadn't realized previously is that its native resolution is 1440x900, the same as the 15\" MBP.  By contrast the 13\" MBP is 1280x800 and the 11\" MBA is 1366x768.  This statistic provides a pleasant surprise.  It makes using this laptop less of a compromise than I had originally thought. The negative is that text characters are smaller than I'm use to.  I'll have to see whether I get use to it.Finally, and perhaps the biggest negative is Apple's failure to add cellular capabilities to this machine. Having the ability to access the Internet anytime and anywhere would provide tremendous value for me.  The Sony Vaio has it (albeit at a much higher price), so the technology exists.  This absence was almost a deal killer for me, which is why I gave the MBA a 4-star rating instead of a 5-star rating.  What got me over the hump was that I really wanted a smaller computer than my 15\" MBP and the knowledge that Apple laptops really hold their value.  If Apple comes out with a MBA with cellular capabilities in the next year, I will be able to sell this laptop for 70-80% of what I paid for it. So my investment will be cheaper than leasing it for the same period.Overall, a very impressive machine.  The size is a huge plus.  The weight is acceptable, but I'd love it if it were closer to 2lbs.  The screen is excellent.  It strikes a good balance between being compact yet big enough to get work done.  I am quite please with this laptop, and I suspect that it will bite into the market shares of both 13 and 15\" MBP laptops.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Product", "Author": "Alva Jones", "ReviewID": "R2IAJ1EDEG1BOB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This Mac is in great condition and runs fast.

I have updated it as of March 2013.  I have left my original review in place so the reader can see how my views have changed from the original review date.***I bought a basic MacBook Air over one year ago.  I had never owned a Mac and the purchase price was high, so I was skeptical about what I was getting.  I also disliked the keyboard (still do) but went ahead because of the constant problems I was having with PCs.  I had spent a hundred dollars ridding the PC of virus problems - again - just prior to buying this MacBook Air, and that was while I was running anti-virus and anti-almost everything else (McAfee) software.  And that software was costing me money every year.  EVERY PC I have ever owned has slowed down over time, usually within six months,  and that includes desktops as well as laptops.  I was fed up with the PC problems and hidden cost so I bought this MacBook Air - and held my breath.I have let the breath go.  After over one year of operation this computer still runs fine.  It is just as fast as it ever was and I have never had a slow down even though I surf the net a lot and shop on Amazon constantly.  It runs off wifi with no problems and I have connected a Logitech keyboard to it without problems.  Plus, there are a ton of applications with reasonable prices.And I have never bought or ran an anti-virus program on this machine; thus, saving me the cost to clean up the computer every few months and paying for anti-virus software every year.  These cost savings add up, and I think I am saving money over the \"cheaper\" PC.My wife still uses a PC, but she is starting to think about an Apple.  The cost is hampering her; however, as the PC slows down and a decisions nears to clean it up plus pay another year of anti-virus, or buy something else, she is leaning toward the Apple.  Maybe by Christmas 2012 she will come around and give me a way to buy a present without a lot of thinking.***Update March 2013I have previously reviewed my Apple computers (see above - a laptop and a desktop).  I have written many reviews, but Amazon does not let me search my own reviews by subject to find the review to update it, so I am stuck. I have owned my Apple Macbook Air for a little less than 2 years and the desktop for one year (approximate).My most significant complaint is the exceptionally poor customer service. Even a slight problem can result in infuriating hassles trying to reach Apple or otherwise solve the glitches on line. APPLE GOES TO GREAT LENGTHS TO PREVENT YOU FROM REACHING A HUMAN. Worse, the on line \"solutions\" are ridiculous, failing to solve even the most common problems. My closest Apple store is in Reno, Nevada about 50 miles away; however, you cannot reach a person at the store by phone. You only get a recording giving directions to the store. This is a specialized Apple Store, not a secondary retailer like Best Buy. Another complete block to human contact.The machines run decently, have few virus problems, and the display is very good. However, they DO suffer from slowdowns over time. When I first bought my Apple laptop it came on and ran instantly - and I mean instantly. Now it takes up to a minute or more to start up. I am having a similar experience with my desktop machine, although the start up for the desktop was never close to instant.Why it is running slower and slower is hard to say. Virus scans and multiple runs of Apple Disk Doctor and disk verifications here at home turn up nothing. I have also erased data on and highly restricted access to Flash programs, among other things. I have updated the operating system with each new update: from Snow Leopard, to Lion, to Mountain Lion. The hard drives on my machines are less than 10 percent full. I can only report that the performance of these machines deteriorates significantly over time.The mere fact that Apple blocks access to human beings is enough to downgrade my rating significantly. The real problem is the people running Apple, they simply have no customer awareness. In addition, the free support for their machine is short and I have found the owners of the local Apple stores an unforgiving lot - even when you purchased the machine from them.The next problem, and this is a HUGE problem, is the availability of programs, and the functioning of programs that are offered. The number of excellent programs available for PC platforms is amazing. They dwarf the number of programs existing for Apple. This especially true in games. The number of first-rate games obtainable for the PC platform is at least triple the availability for Apple. In addition, many of the programs that are available for Apple from outside vendors run poorly. One example of this is the Dragon speech dictation program, which runs very poorly on Apple but very well on PC platforms. There are literally dozens of other examples. Read the software reviews here on Amazon.Another complaint is the worthless Apple keyboard. I have arthritis and using the keyboard is difficult. Aftermarket keyboards do work; however, Apple has several specialized keys not duplicated on aftermarket keyboards. These same keyboards, although excellent in design, exhibit odd anomalies commonly associated with all aftermarket non-Apple products. Of course, \"fixing\" a laptop keyboard isn't possible. One can plug in another keyboard but that harms the portability of the machine, a key reason to buy a laptop. When I say the keyboard is bad I mean worthless. The keyboard on the machine is nearly unusable for me because of my arthritis. I use an Adesso curved keyboard on my desktop and it works pretty well.After two years of experience with an Apple laptop (and desktop), I cannot recommend Apple. The actual computer itself, and the display, are above standard, and at the price charged they should be; however, everything else is below acceptable standards. For all the virus problems with PC machines, and the necessity to \"clear out\" the junk accumulating within the programs over time, the PCs run just as fast, cost much less money to buy, have far far more programs available for them, run after market add-ons like keyboards, game controllers, et al, without a glitch, and new programs, products, and games coming out are all written for the PC Platform, not the Apple.And yes I have read all the glowing reviews. I wrote one of them myself after owning the laptop for about six months and I was dumb enough to buy a desktop about a year later; however, time has changed my mind. I am buying my wife a new computer for Christmas, and it will be a PC based platform (Toshiba). She has used PCs for years, and even after my glowing reviews of Apple and my second purchase she would not abandon her old old PC. Guess what? She was right. For all its \"problems\" the PC platform, and the companies selling the PC platform, have a strong customer orientation that Apple does not have. If you want a company to put YOU first and a machine that runs everything out there, buy a PC.AD2", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "The screen is waaaaaay too fragile - do not buy this laptop!", "Author": "Matt S \"Matt S\"", "ReviewID": "R9ELFYRFC4GD3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've purchased two 13\" Macbook Airs and thought they were quite well made, which they largely are, except the screen which is incredibly fragile.

It is seamless - just one cable and voila, I have a 27\" display and all my peripherals hooked up to it.  The Air does not even flinch and handles the 27\" display flawlessly.  This is especially useful for viewing large spreadsheets, editing video, and things of that nature.Battery life is OK, not great, however.  I could get 7 hours on very low screen brightness doing nothing but word processing, but anything like watching a video will burn up the battery pretty quick.  But the trade off for functionality and speed in a 3 pound wonder is well worth it.  I live my life out of my Air and I barely notice it is there - it is a tool that just works.  There are some tradeoffs you need to deal with in switching to Mac from PC - like webmail through Exchange is much more full-featured in Explorer than through Safari, some flash applications do not work, and a few minor nits.  I love, love the backlit keyboard - just makes sense!  The aluminum case is the bomb - I mean, wow, what nicely assembled product.  No creaks, no flexing, it just feels great in the hand.  The computer restarts from cold in about 15 seconds and wakes from sleep mode in the time it takes to raise the lid.  This means instant productivity.  I only reboot it to accept software updates when needed, otherwise it is always on and I never shut down my applications - the F3 key is awesome to quickly navigate open apps.  Did I mention it is fast, I mean, everything happens nearly instantly.  I can open and view a research-grade 150 page PDF file loaded with spreadsheets, graphs, and images and it just opens it up instantly with zero lag when scrolling from beginning to end.  The trackpad is AMAZING - scrolling an resizing webpages and PDF files is just a great experience (too bad the resize does not work with MS Office for Mac).Why will I never buy a PC again?  Well, after a few days of ownership my Air and Time Capsule crashed and totally locked each other up.  I was really, really mad.  I took it all back to the Apple Store - they said they didn't want to waste my time trying to figure anything out and offered me all brand new hardware on the spot with a full month to decide if I want to still stay with Mac.  So I went home with another brand new Air and a new Time Capsule and everything has worked flawlessly since.  SO, in a word, customer service when you need it is where it is at.  That is why, BTW, I have driven Lexus the past few years - they also know what customer service is all about, at least that has been my good experience.I am pleased, pleased, pleased with my Macbook Air and recommend it without reservation.  If you are new to Mac, do not be afraid, just tell yourself you will have to go through a learning curve and in a few weeks you should be good to go and probably will never look back.  I know nothing about playing games on the Mac vs. PC because I am not a gamer, so no advice on that.Update:  One more thing I would like to add is how I went about my final decision to switch to Apple?  I really wanted to avoid Mac, and tried to convince myself to get another pc - mostly because of lack of experience with Apple (we do have an iPad however, which we also love).  I spent a lot of time between Apple Store and big box stores comparing laptops.  Some big box stores also carry both, so it was easy to compare.  What did I find?  Well, there were maybe 25 pc's on display and I'll bet that 50% of them were locked up with the blue screen of death.  None of the track pads worked consistently on any of them - I tried Vaio and Asus (they have their version of the Air) and it was riddled with operating problems.  In contrast, I never came across an Apple Macbook, Air, or iMac that was not running.  In fact, they all run exactly the same.  Finally, I talked to a few of the techs in the big box stores - they all said they spend each morning trouble-shooting all the crashed pc's, but the Apple products run for months without issues.  I must say my iPad has never had a problem either.  So, that how I made my ultimate decision to switch to Apple.  For the kinds of things I do (mostly office type stuff) I could not tell the difference between the Air and the Pro - so I went for portability, and with the Thunderbolt display it is almost an iMac!Follow-up:  Now in my 15th month of ownership, I must say the Macbook Air continues to impress!  In general, this computer has been \"on\" since I bought it and has never crashed or hung-up.  I only have rebooted for system updates, speaking of which, are seamless every time.  It has never ever crashed.  Let me repeat that - EVER!  Now that is amazing.  My wife has since gotten an identical Macbook Air that we bought as a refurb through Apple store.  I use this laptop every day and it travels with me every day.  I also switched to a Macbook Pro at work, the wife and I both have iphone 5, and our 8 year old daughter has an ipod 4thG.  None of these devices has ever crashed.  This is so amazing to me after so many years of pc nonsense.  Needless to say, I am now a bonafide Apple nut!  The new Macbook Pro with Retina is the bomb, but for routine use like email, spreadsheets, powerpoint, web, photos, video chat, etc. you can't beat the MBA for portability and lightweight.  As a side note, we are having some problems with the hard drive on our time capsule router, but that is under warranty, fully realizing that any hard drive running continuously is prone to failure.

The computer boots in 14 seconds and shuts down in 4, programs open instantly, and the entire feel is extremely smooth.- Intel HD 3000 Graphics fare okay in games; they seem to handle Valve games (even the newest ones such as Portal 2 and HL2E2) well. Other games can be played on native resolution at medium settings.- The battery life at 50% and light-medium usage is 7 hours, but it can be easily extended to 8+ hours by turning down the brightness. At maximum brightness and medium usage, the battery life is 5:30 minutes.- Also to mention is the absolutely dazzling design; the device is remarkably thin and light; and it looks beautiful and sturdy at the same time. It's important to note that the wifi problem has been fixed with the new Mac update (10.7.2).- The Macbook Air fares well versus similar competitors; it is actually priced lower than most of its competitors (except the Lenovo Ultrabook - which really does not offer the same level of performance and design).Con:- When using the laptop in an intensive task it does become noticeably hot and noisy - nothing extreme, but definitely noticeable.I have been using the laptop for nearly 3 months now, and I have to say that I am absolutely impressed, and recommend it greatly over any of its competitors for anyone looking for a powerful ultra-portable laptop.

Slick designSturdy construction2.  Light weight3.  Speedy processor for light duty work4.  Intuitive integration of software.5.  Keyboard with back lighting6.  Still the best ultrabook available, but that is about to change in less than a year with several new entries into the segment.7.  Apps available.8.  Individual keys for volume and brightness control.  This allow simple and quick changes.9.  Probably the best and most important feature of the laptop is the bright and high resolution screen.  It makes reading 10X easier and more comfortable.10. Stable OS11. Supposedly pretty much virus free. Unfortunately, i can't say the same with window systems.12. No moving parts to break down except the cooling fan which comes on only rarely.13. Trackpad- more useful than just the good old track pads, but function is a bit unreliable and takes some training.Cons-1.  Battery life is no where close to the claimed > 7 hours, unless you turn off Wifi, set at very dim level and do not run video. For routine use, 3 hours is more like it.2.  The fonts are small and not always easy to increase in size. somewhat limited customization options.3.  Slow video processor.  Most Youtube or internet video will play fine, but some will not play well or at all.  I have compared it side by side with my HP Envy and the Mac appears disabled compared to the Envy. Very limited graphic memory and not upgradable.4.  Keyboard feels flimsy.  This is subjective, but i feel that the HP envy keypads provide more feedback..6.  High initial cost of entry.7.  Mac OS- this is subjective and controversial obviously, but i find Window 7 easier to use with more customization options.8.  Windows 7 still by far has more compatible accessories and software. There are software that allow dual OS or cross compatibility, but most of them will slow down your computer and they are not necessarily cheap.9.  No USB 3.010. The power off button is one of the keys on the keyboard next to Delete and Volume control which means inadvertent power off is not infrequent unless you pay attention to it.11. Unreliable trackpad-  beautiful engineering when it works, but is often unreliable and inconsistent.  I use my good old mouse every chance i can get.To summarize, it is probably still the best Ultrabook available, but probably not for long. You will like it if you absolutely have to have a Mac ultrabook or you cannot wait another 6 months for better competing models from the PC camp.  If don't care for the Mac OS and you can wait for another few months, then i would go for Window 8 Ultrabooks which will likely be available sometime next year. Better yet, if you don't really need an ultrabook, get a real computer.", "Date": "December 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Latest release does reinvent the notebook for me at least", "Author": "volsfan \"volsfan\"", "ReviewID": "RRB65QN98AQ4N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Since 2005 I've schlepped a Dell laptop around because that is what my company gives me.  Still running XP, heavy, slowing down already after 6 months.  I usually am ready for a trade up after 2-3 years.  Cue Reality Distortion Field - I'm going to work for another group and can actually use a Mac.  As long as it has Office, they don't care.  They support iOS devices!  Egads....OK - let's attack hardware here and the actual machine itself.  Design - it's gorgeous.  Solid as.....well, aluminium and glass with a backlit keyboard (thank you, thank you, thank you) and a great screen compared to what I've been using.  New CPU & existing SSD setup - powers through all my mainstream and relatively lightweight computing needs without breaking a sweat.  Haven't tried gaming on it, probably never will.  Office, power points, email, web surfing, HD video, blah, blah, blah.  Battery life - has been excellent for me so far.  Would say I'm hitting the 7 hours advertised and that's with a reasonable screen brightness, etc.  Keyboard - full size, types great.  Some have griped that it feels 'shallow' with limited travel.  Given the ridicuously thin depth of the case, I'd say they did a decent job.  But yes, I've noticed it a little.  Trackpads - if you look at my reviews you'll see that I HATE them.  Let me grab a cold glass of Apple Kool-Aid here and just say it.  I like this trackpad.  It's big and the glass is perfect in feel and friction and the gestures actually work well.  So now I don't have to carry a travel mouse around.  The traveler's creed - carry less, go lighter and simpler! Speaking of Apple elegance, go compare chargers.  Dell's 65W brick is huge and clumsy.  Apple's 45W separates in two (you can leave the huge extension cord at home) and is half the size easily.  Plus MagSafe(R) which is brillant.  One downside - FaceTime camera sucks.  They cheaped out and just gave us SD rather than HD.Philosophy - being chained to a desktop is silly.  This is a machine that does almost everything I need a computer to do and it's portable enough that I can BE portable with it.  iCloud and iOS5 will only enhance this.  I've never owned a Mac previously and although I can see some of the shortfalls of Lion already, in general, OS X just blows Windows(R) out of the water.  SSD blows 7,200 rpm SATA drives out of the water.  With typical Apple 'understated elegance' this compact little machine does what I want it to without the typical PC headaches, drama and \"cobbled together\" feeling.Gripes - Very few and none are deal breakers for me.  The thick extension cord section is silly.  I'm not sold on the Mission Control vs. Lauch Pad vs. Dock location for everything yet.  As another reviewer said, trying to consolidate ALL of Apple's computing OSes into ONE idiom may not necessarily be a good thing.  Keep the desktop metaphor and leave the iOS stuff to MOBILE devices.  Autosave and Versions have some issues.  I'm sure Apple will fix down the road.  As above, this is the old iChat SD camera - HD FaceTime would have been nice as on the MBP.  You make us pay $29 for an Ethernet doggle.Bottom line - it's a player now.  Fully baked and ready for prime time.  I went out and gleefully plunked down money for it.  Probably should have gone 256 GB on the SSD.  Upgrades aren't cost effective or feasible for most of the MBA.  Apple has nailed the target and re-defined the ultraportable class.  Again.  Drop dead sexy design (did I just call a notebook sexy?), competitive hardware, pricing and an OS to match is very dangerous for the competition.  Throw in Apple's carefully orchestrated ecosystem, Genius Bar, lack of crapware, lack of viruses and other Mac virtues and you'll be thinking very hard about getting one.  HIGHLY recommended if you're looking for mainstream computing with ultraportable form factor.  And flying back on the red eye from SLC this evening, every single person sitting up front in the comfy seats with me was drooling over it.  :-)  Definitely going to be a huge hit with the frequent flier miles crowd.  I think it'll do really well on Main St. as well.1 month update 8 26 2011Occasionally drop a known network (home in my case).  No big deal, double click on the network ID, issue resolved.  I did run the update and it didn't fix.  I'm much more comfortable with Lion and have tweaked settings so that mail doesn't hog all the SSD space.  Time Machine works transparently in the background and I'm using an external drive on another PC in my home network!  Very cool.  It's still an amazing piece of hardware and drool worthy.  Almost as easy to transport as my iPad was but it is a real computer.  No qualifiers needed.  I also checked and mine has the faster Samsung SSD rather than the Toshiba.  Thank goodness.  Still wish I'd gotten the bigger SSD.  Oh, my wife wants one so I'll have to go fork out more $$$ this September probably  ;-)7 24 12 update (1 year) - Still love this thing.  Battery has been through 250+ cycles and still within 90% of the original runtime (will get 6 hours if not a little more with most activities although video playback can drain harder).  OS X is virus free, slowdown free, updates on the fly and I'm looking forward to Mountain Lion update coming soon.  My Winblowz desktop gets slower, requires registry cleanup, had a rootkit virus and boots slower as time goes on.  My MBA performs as it did the day I bought it.  Yes it would be nice to upgrade to the USB3 ports, marginally faster SSD and IvyBridge processor with improved graphics performance.  But there is no obsolescence here and this is still very much the machine and form factor that everyone strives to copy and/or beat.  Good luck with that IMHO.  For a highly portable laptop with no MS induced headaches and something that just flat works and serves most of my personal computing needs.  I never felt the need to update a review and brag that my company issued Dell was running as well after 12 months of travel and use.  ;-)  The Dell that I bought for my wife running Win7 after 12 months?  Crippled by the OS, has slowed incredibly compared to when it was new, has a cooling issue or background virus issue with the fan running close to non-stop  I could back all the data off, blow away everything, throw another 4 GB of ram at it and reload OS and data for a clean install.

Why Because in the last 4 years my family has converted. We started with the Iphone and then the Macbook Pro and the First Gen Mac Air and eventually When we needed one more we did go for an Asus netbook.. not to mention the dead toshiba laptop that is more of a book weight on my table. The windows Pcs and netbooks though have no limitations are a chore to work with once you get spoilt by a Mac.  I even tried a Ipad and felt let down by no flash. That said there are Flash players like Photon and puffin and may more which work well with Ipad too now. But when comparing between the mac air and the Motorola Xoom and the Mac Book Air..The fact that the air would have no limitations other than not being a tablet led me to making the purchase.This is by far the lightest laptop one can have. Sleek and classy. But since I will be putting on a cover that really wont be very obvious.I can have this laptop on my chest while sleeping and work with it.  I do feel I could have used the ipad ...thank to my ipod addiction but I really believe that the ipad screen is not that small and the macbook air is just about a tad bit bigger not to mention it closes so its safer . I  would anyways have to get one of those porfolio case for my ipad which would have made its almost similar in size.i can have the large hard drive space and not to mention the array of apps. ....this version lets you download apps with just 1 click like ur iphone or ipod.I realize the trackpad has more options...The three finger to Copy is awesome. I didnt realise this until I accidentally did it. On further scrutiny I realized there are a few more functions added to the track pad than my old macs.I love the Photo booth and Facetime both.Its 256 GB of flash drive which makes it faster that regular macs and also the 4gb ram is really awesome.Its i5 but u can have i7 for those who need it. For me this itself is an overkill and if my husband would have not pressed on the 13 in screen I reall would have loved the 11 inch.  I did take the 256 GB because I store a lot of photos and educational files on my comp and didnt want and overloaded 128 gb laptop.Apparantly these cant be tweeked to increase Ram but I really dont do all that with a Mac anyways...Windows yes...But i really would not want to risk loosing warranty on my Mac by opening it and replacing it with hardware.I read somewhere that the older versions have no backlit keys ...which is really surprising..because I really thought that was a staple with all macs...That is also one reason I went for the latest one and also the specs with i5 make it more powerful.I have tried the thunderbolt port to watch movies with hdmi...u might have to go into sounds in finder and click on your TV for audio or it may seem like it does not support audio like the old thunderbolt ports.A good complete laptop.Why did I cancel a Star...I really see there is so much competition and considering there is not a huge difference between the older and newer mac book airs this one is still priced very steep.Not to mention no USB 3.0.Else...It more than suits my needs.", "Date": "August 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Best purchase ever", "Author": "Harshit  Pandey", "ReviewID": "RPL9P05RPSVOR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ultra sleek, super fast, awesome look, great OS - insanely awesome mouse gestures support and in all flawless beauty.I was windows fan, i used this for one week and trust me- i never want to see windows again in life.

There are plenty of great features here, the computer is beautifully built and lightweight and yet many of these features are either useless to me as a casual user, and there are enough annoyances that get in the way of my normal use.Pros:-Very light and easy to carry.-Nice lay out and workflow.-Boots up fast (when it does boot up).-Works very nicely with other Mac products (obviously).-You don't have to worry as much about viruses and constant annoying software updates from Java, etc.Cons:-Constant problems with computer not going to sleep and the battery being drained when I want to use it.-Impossible to sync volume across all functions (volume will be different with headphones in, computer still makes start up noise even if previously muted).-Computer doesn't sleep when you close the lid--you need to download a separate app for that.-Many of the fixes for these annoying issues are not found in official Apple guidance and you need to search the internet for third party solutions.-Power cord is too short.Here is a link to a typical work-around solution I found on the internet, note how the author talks about his issue and then at the bottom says he had the reverse issue early on:[...]This is what I have found life with Mac to be like, consistent annoying issues with \"easy\" work around solutions. It wouldn't be so bad if the cost was comparable to a similar PC model, which I realize has their own set of issues, but when you're forking over more than a $1,000 to do mostly simple tasks you want a close to flawless execution. The Macbook Air 13\" has not provided that for me and provided plenty of other things, like triple finger swiping that I have no real use for after saying, \"wow, cool.\"It's like dating a beautiful super model (with expensive taste) that has just enough character flaws to make you question the entire relationship.", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great product!

Later i saw it somewhere even if you didn't spend extra money for the whatever Tech support, in the first 14 days or a month after purchasing, you should still be able to get Apple support as a new customer...Anyhow, after searching on Internet by myself, I figured the problem with the Macbook wifi issue could be solved by changing the router or the internet provider, after I changed my internet provider to TWC and changed the router to Netgear, it worked great, never had an issue again.It is my first Macbook, but I was using an iPad for a year, it doesn't take much time to get used to Mac system, and after getting used to it, I absolutely love it!", "Date": "May 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "super sexy computer", "Author": "Suzy Q \"Sandy\"", "ReviewID": "R38PK10B04YS8V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love my Apple MacBook Air.

With that being said I will proceed to give you my first impressions.Coming from a windows and linux background, there is a bit of a learning curve to get used to when starting out with the new device. However, after taking the time to get used to it, I have grown to really love this computer. So far the battery life on it has been excellent and the SSD makes disc reads and writes super fast.For anyone that is thinking about getting the 13 macbook pro, stop thinking that and just get the air. Now that they remote drive option is available, there really isn't a need to have the disc drive. Also the screen resolution on the air is much better. Also if you are thinking about getting the 15 inch macbook pro so that you will have a bigger screen, the screen resolution on the 15 inch pro is the same as on the 13 inch air so you aren't really gaining any screen area.I know that I said that I didn't need it earlier but the lack of an optical drive is kinda lame. However, the air is thin and light enough that I can let that slide.The only downside that I have run into so far is when i tried to use an external usb dvd drive to read some of my cd's because the air would not recognize my optical drive.The backlit keyboard is amazing even though there is a little bit of light showing around the edges of the keys. It isn't enough to blind you but it is noticeable.The only real recommendation that I can give to apple about this product is that I would like to see 128gb, 256gb, and 512gb 15 models of the air with a 1200p resolution. That would be awesome.For those of you that are thinking about getting the macbook pro, just go ahead and get the 13 inch air. The air is much better than the 13 inch pro, in my opinion, and much more convenient than the 15 and 17 inch pro. Now if you are going to be doing some serious (and I do mean serious) photo and video editing to the point that you are getting paid to do that, then I would recommend the 17 inch pro.

Re-setting PRAM and SMC does nothing.

I bought Apple and regret it since then. Obviously it is constructed beautifully but there are many flaws as I see it . The biggest drawback was mousepad. Yes it has pinch zoon,smooth surface but when you actually want to choose something you have to press down that very firm mousepad all the time. Windows laptops allow a tap on the pad to make the selection but not apple. It is a major major draw back . Wifi is very weak for connection too. I can't get the connection from my dinning room while my Android phones are connected to the same wifi network even further away from there in my house.
