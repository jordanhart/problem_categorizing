Up to now I still don't have any problems or malfunctions with anything on the laptop. Its big and professional looking. Played games on it with no lag whatsoever.

Most annoying is the round-about way to get to your desktop. The touch pad must be adjusted to not have unwanted functions open without your calling for it to open.", "Date": "January 27, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love this!", "Author": "C.A.

The Pavilion I had that this one replaced was from the DV series.  You know the ones that have the over heat problem.  Well this one has been on since I opened the box, and plugged it in.  Not a hot spot anywhere.  I do believe this laptop, and I will get along just fine.  I am very happy I purchased it.  My son ordered the last one I had, which I only had a few short months.  So far so good with this one.", "Date": "April 30, 2014"}, {"Title": "So amazing for the price", "Author": "Christopher Lee DeLacio", "ReviewID": "R25Q9ETN824TRH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was using a dell vostro 1500 which was not bad but I needed an upgrade that I can also game on without spending 1,000 dollars. This is my best purchase off of amazon so far and I have ordered a lot, It came in refurbished packaging and this thing is perfect no scratches or dents, I have not had a problem with playing any game that I have desired to play and windows 8 really is not as bad as people say. I would have to say that the only con is that this laptop is kinda flimsy but if you are not dropping it without a case then you are all good.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Defective screen", "Author": "Antoinette", "ReviewID": "R22JJCGEGAKYLB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Defective screen, if it was accurately tested and verified before shipping... i would not have a delay with enjoying my laptop.", "Date": "November 16, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00BL7K2UO"}}
