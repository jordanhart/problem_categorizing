I love the easy type keyboard, it has a one button recovery, which may come in handy when I need to set it back to factory settings. It has an SD card slot and supports an HDMI cable. This model has the Radeon graphics card, the graphics are wonderful, even set at the lowest quality. I use it to play World of Warcraft and it does fine. After hours of play it doesn't run hot.  When the servers are busy and I begin to lag, I lower the graphics settings and I still enjoy a good gaming experience.  If your a serious gamer that plans to play various games I would suggest to spend a little more money and get something with a faster processor and maybe a little more RAM. Lenovo is an innovative company and will be first choice when it's time to upgrade my family's computers...Loving my Lenovo", "Date": "September 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "SUPER Impressed!!!", "Author": "junj64", "ReviewID": "R3MHXZ4NRERN0L", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have to say after reading ALL the negative reviews about this laptop having issues with Wi-Fi & CPU problems I was doubting myself if I should get this laptop but after a few days with it my doubts are erased.This is a GREAT laptop. Sure, You have to get used to Windows 8 but once you get the hang of it it's all a breeze.The AMD 1.4 Quad core processor and the 4GB of RAM makes everything you do snappy and lag free.It uses a regular HDMI cable so I connected it on my 60 inch TV and the picture is flawless.The Wi-Fi on this laptop is amazing.It can play games as well, anything from 2010 and later years will play smoothly.Remember it's not like this has an Intel i7 Core...For basic gaming, browsing, video chatting & multimedia this is a MUST buy.", "Date": "October 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good laptop for its price but not a laptop for a serious multi-tasker", "Author": "movie viewer", "ReviewID": "RECIDKUE5RZ1E", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I received my laptop fairly quickly. Which is great since I needed it for my college classes, since my last laptop broke down.First Impression:PRO:I LOVE the aesthetic design of the laptop, the keys are not all bunched up together and it does not feel like it was built with cheap plastic parts.Matte BlackThe track pad was great, a few times it started to pinch zoom by itself, it is prone to get dirty because of the matte finish should be the reason why it can lead to an unresponsive track pad.Pretty decent laptop for its price.The apps open up quickly and it does boot up quickly. I haven't tried playing any pc games but I watch netflix with no problem which important.CON:The internet connection is slow, or at least to my brother's laptop. I cannot open multiple tabs on Chrome and stream music om it without a slight lag. Probably I am impatient about loading a page for more than 5 seconds.Windows 8, not a big fan of the start tiles and app storeHate how it makes you use a microsoft account to use the feature on the computer, if you do not you will miss out.Comes with useless apps that probably you wouldn't use.This laptop is sufficient for a person who just needs to check their email, watch the occasional youtube video, or write that essay for a high school English class. Not for a multi-tasker college student like myself,I will write an update before the end of the year, I am thinking about returning it.", "Date": "December 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Lenovo G505 15.6 Laptop (Black)", "Author": "Beth Spiteri", "ReviewID": "R245RQLUDAM7K3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I trust the Lenovo name.

This is my first Lenovo PC. Had 4 Acer laptops and one Dell Vostro 1000 laptop before and compared to the Lenovo G505, I like the Acer and Dell better. Also the laptops I had in the past, the processor were all meant for basic use. I am sure that Lenovo is good brand and if you are willing to pay more, then Lenovo has some great laptops better than what either Dell or Acer have.The keyboard and the sound are two of my favorite features on this laptop. The keyboard is very good to type. The sound output is great and room filling. The screen is good. The computer is extremely slow. If you are downloading or installing a program it takes a while for the download process to finish. I tried to use the media playing program powerdvd 10 and the player did not do a good job in playing the DVD. It kept freezing. I had to download another media player from the internet. I downloaded VLC media player and the same DVD played very well. I am having another issue with the CD/DVD drive. I have to put my two or three finger nails in between the small gap under the tray and tilt the DVD tray cover for the drive to open instead of pressing the eject button. I called Lenovo support to figure this out and they told me that I can send the computer for repairs. Since my laptop is new, they told me to exchange this from the store where I purchased this. Since I am not going to use this laptop for watching DVD's, I may not. Surfing the internet on this laptop is slow as well. I have installed google chrome and it seems to be a bit better than internet explorer. As far as Windows 8, I am okay with it.I only use this computer for my work while I travel. Comparatively this laptop is very lightweight. All I need this computer is to run MS Office and another program. I barely use this computer to surf the internet. So I am not annoyed by the slow download speeds. Overall I will not recommend this laptop if you are planning on using this as your primary PC.", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's expected for a $300 notebook", "Author": "Omegajb", "ReviewID": "RW6V5A86TFAFH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife who needs a notebook for some things that are just not possible or practical on a tablet.

You move the mouse and the stupid time box pops up and is more annoying then helpful. I need to research to see if I can load Windows 7 on it if Lenovo has drivers that will work.If I had to do it again for the same money I might have purchased one of the other $300 notebooks but I don't know if they would be any better than this.", "Date": "December 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice", "Author": "Alan Lopez", "ReviewID": "R2LZ5OUHVASE4F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Excellent.. the laptop this really flat and can take everywhere.. the battery last around 5-6 hours on balance.. and about perfomance i'm pleased considering how much i pay for it...i've been using it for like 3 months and its still fine..", "Date": "November 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Basic Workhorse", "Author": "Stephanie H.", "ReviewID": "R3OL54IW35P8Q1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The screen size is perfect, the weight is a MAJOR improvement from my previous beast, and it does everything I need to do on a daily basis.

I bought this from Fry's BRAND NEW and have had it for a week. I gave it a chance but it still runs terribly slow. I needed this laptop to do my college work but it can't even handle that. Having two tabs open kills the speed incredibly. I've tried Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer they all run about the same (Chrome being the slowest). Windows 8 sucks, we all know that.

Most sites come up pretty quickly, but if there's a lot of flash junk on the site you are visiting, it can be a bit slow to load. I used to use VLC player a lot, but it seems to have trouble running vids in 720p so I'm using a different player instead. I speculate that the reason for this is that VLC seems to use a large amount of processing power, and the computer is already using quite a bit just to run Windows 8. Occasional \"Not Responding\" when I'm trying to access my files, but I am using three external hard drives, so again I suspect that the processing power is just a little low.However; nothing has crashed as of yet, I have been able to have multiple browser tabs open without slowing down, I've streamed video online fairly well, other video files playing through a media player look fantastic.

This computer was definitely worth the money. I would seriously recommend this computer for anyone that is in the position I was in. It has an unbelievable battery life, a nice screen - doing college work on the \"high-end\" computers can hurt my eyes after more than an hour of working on something, a perfect keyboard layout with the number keypad addition, and runs very smoothly to not have high RAM - whatever that is (don't know, don't care!).

I don't know how well it works on touch screens but it doesn't work here. The 8.1 made it a little bit more user friendly but.. I don't know if it's windows or the sensitivity of this mouse pad but unwanted windows keep popping up everywhere even after I turned off the corners.I constantly have to go to task manager just to get things turned off completely. Why? Why? Why? I choose this because I'm mainly looking for something to write with and heard the keyboards on the Lenovo are the best. Think again. First off the edges are so sharp it scrapes against your wrists or forearms depending on whether your typing on the couch, in bed, or at a desk. The quality of the camera and audio for 2014 is ridiculous even compared to my 9 year old HP and not even worthy of record a simple song which is the only other thing I like to use my lap top for. Beleive me my iphone 4 does a better job at that and my HP was beautiful.. To top it off, today number keys 5 & 6 (yes I'm typing this from my iMac) Quit working all together. Number Pad and Numbers across the top. It's a complete waste of money. if Amazon took stuff back for dissatisfaction I would return it in an instant. As it is I'm sure I'll need something to replace it within six months. Horrible.

I would take it from my home to a coffee shop every once in a while. But after about 60 days of having this laptop, the screen goes blank. It's still backlit so I know its not broken but after the start-up screen, it just goes to black. I could boot it into safe mode and get to the desk top, so I knew it must of been a driver. Because it was fairly new and I didn't have any extremely important files on it, I booted it into safe mode and did a system wipe to get it back to the way it was out of the box. But on start up it gets stuck in a loop saying that it needs to install windows. (It didn't come with a Windows 8 CD) So I call Lenovo and they say to use the One-touch Recovery System.  I did that and now the laptop boots up. But it would be a lie to say it's \"working\"  because nothing works. It's unbelievably slow.  I'll click a button and nothing will happen to 5 minutes.  Any program that I do get to work  will give me a \"Not responding\" message after after about 2 minutes. Its worthless.  Here's the thing. I do freelance video work in and I used this laptop to visit clients and pick up files off their external hard drives (that fact that it has USB 3.0 plugs is one of the reasons I bought it)  It was nice because they would bring their hard drive, I would get the files and then we could review them on the laptop. I would take the files home and transfer them to one of my hard drives. But now I can't do that. And I actually lost a bid because the person said they only had a hard drive and I would need a laptop to pic up the files. I could just get another one but $300 is huge to somebody just starting out.The whole situation is unbelievably frustrating. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this laptop. I bought it because I had always hear good things from Lenovo and I thought it was a good deal. It's not. You can spend an extra $50 a get a better computer.  I get asked a lot about technology from friends and family and I can honestly say that I will never recommend a Lenovo product to anybody.
