{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Quite possibly one of the worst laptops I've ever owned", "Author": "The Gifted One", "ReviewID": "R55KGZKWG9P3Y", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Back in 2009 I purchased HP's so-called powerful high-performance HDX-16 Laptop.  I purchased one of the higher end ones.  Upgraded Specs were:- 2.53Ghz Core 2 Duo- 320GB HDD (after first year I upgraded this to a 500GB Seagate Hybrid SSD/- 6GB RAM- 1GB Nvidia GeForce GT 130MWent to the HP website and purchased this computer because it was supposed to be one of the best the company offered at that time.  Total cost after taxes came out to nearly $1,500.00.  I purchased it with the intention of it giving me good reliable performance for at least 4-5 years at a minimum.  When spending this kind of money on a computer, it's what a consumer would expect.INITIAL IMPRESSIONSFirst couple of months of owning the computer, it was wonderful.  Fast and reliable.  Large and beautiful 16\" screen.  It was very quiet and never even got very hot unless I played a highly demanding game on it.  It was very fast when it came to multitasking, video editing, and playing high intensity video games.  Initially I was extremely satisfied with the computer.AFTER FIRST YEARAround month 12-14 of owning this computer is when the problems started.  The multimedia bar at the top of the keyboard started malfunctioning.  Wi-Fi would constantly turn on and off on its own randomly while I'm using the net.  The volume controls would also turn themselves up and down randomly.  The battery failed around month 14 and already needed to be replaced.  The laptop fan began running extremely loud just from regular web-surfing.  It even started to run hot without even doing any demanding tasks.  Since it was past the magical one-year mark, HP did little to help and wouldn't even acknowledge most of these issues.  I cleared the laptop of all dust and bought a new battery in hopes of it helping the system.  It didn't change the heat nor the loud noise from the fans attempting to cool the system.  After researching online about this laptop, I discovered that other users had been having some of these same problems with this model laptop.  It came from the extremely cheap and low-quality parts HP used to make this machine.  At this point I felt it was best to just keep using this laptop despite it's problems since I paid so much money for it.YEARS 2-3 AND LAST DAYSA little after the full second year of having this computer, the replacement battery that I bought was pretty much dead again.  The laptop had began running louder and hotter than ever.  The media smart controls at the top of the keyboard were still running wild.  There periods of 30 straight minutes where the Wi-Fi would turn itself on and off over and over.  Making internet unusable for significant amounts of time.  The fingerprint reader still worked but there were times where it wouldn't respond and it was quicker to just type in your password manually.  Just as in the first year, HP would not acknowledge these problems.  Eventually I just became fed up with this computer.  A $1500 machine that only performed well for about 11 months is unacceptable.  This 3 year experience left me completely disappointed and angry with HP.  I will never again buy one of their products and cannot recommend them for anyone else who plans on using their machine for over a year.  I had decided to get an Apple Macbook Pro (2011) and to sell the HP HDX for whatever value it still had.  As if the disappointment from the machine itself wasn't enough, I had discovered that my grand $1500 machine deteriorated to barely being worth around $250 after only 3 years.  Most computer places didn't want to buy the machine at all.  Right now I couldn't be happier with my MacBook and a company who actually cares about their consumers concerns.FINAL THOUGHTSIf you're in the market for a new laptop, I have to strongly recommend you stay away from HP.  At least stay away from their so called \"high-end\" machines.  I honestly would not spend more than $300 on one of their machines.  I've had underwhelming laptops before but to spend $1500 on one that performs well for barely a year is pathetic and a disgrace.  If you're only a casual user looking to surf and use Facebook, then their low end machines might be ok.  Otherwise go with someone else.", "Date": "May 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "HP Worst Laptop on the Market", "Author": "gtrman", "ReviewID": "R3F9KZJPWBXVJ3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The HP HDX16 and my prior HPX18 and HP ZD7000 laptops, were absolutely designed to fail.  How could it be otherwise, as all failed within 2 years of ownership. Worst build of any laptop bar none, with an even worse post-sale customer service, if you can believe that.  No wonder HP is facing class-action lawsuits.  Horrible all around.  Do yourself a favor and skip HP products.  They are certainly happy to make the sale but soon forget you exist.  Not a company you want to be dealing with when your laptop craps out--and it will within the first 2 years of ownership. Total runaround by their outsourced customer service department in some sweatshop in India.  Complete garbage.  You've been warned!

The HDX 16 model has an hardware problem with its touchbar control strip ( Those lit up buttons for PLAY FORWARD STOP VOLUME CTRL et al ). This thing automatically starts flashing  VOLUME BASS TREBLE on your screen no matter what you are doing, be it typing or web surfing or watching a movie on a DVD. If you are on the web it delays all keyboard inputs, same for MS word, making you miss some letters when you type. Its common problem reported by so many people all over the internet. Just type \"HDx 16 volume bass treble\" in google search and you will know what I am talking about. There no decent solution to this problem (HP support have ultimately asked people to format their hard drive (an insane soln) and still it doesn't solve the problem . The only way it stops is if you open the laptop and remove the ribbon connector to the media control strip , but this also means you will no longer be able to use your built in wireless card (because wireless ON/OFF button is in that touch strip).

A. You can get used to the glossy screen and it no longer bothers me and B. It's an 16\" laptop... what did you expect!What I do mind, however, is being taken advantage of. It has been less than a year and so far I've had the motherboard replaced and now the HDD died. In both cases the problem was a defect that HP were apparently aware this model has. However, they didn't bother to notify anyone. Instead they quietly stopped selling them (if you check, you'll see that HDX18-1180US, HDX16-1140US and HDX X16-1160US are all unavailable). As a result I've lost documents and personal files that cannot be restored. I know, I know, I should have backed everything up, but a notification that something like this could happen to my brand new laptop would have been useful.I live overseas so the support guys here have been great. I can't really complain. And it's true that this laptop's product description is quite impressive. While it worked, it worked perfectly.

They have excessive training in \"manners\" and inadequate training in their work. They must fill out form info on the caller for half an hour. Their computer support (they search your problem as they talk) is weak (their response times are slow) and requires them to access multiple \"data bases\" on multiple computers.In fairness, I suppose, after many years and many laptops, I stopped buying Dell because they were worse....

A faster processor, beautiful 1080p screen, increased RAM, larger hard disk, and blu-ray/DVD drive all enhance the user experience.  Improved shell design eliminates the visable wear problems associated with the earlier HP laptops.  Cooler operation negates the need for a lap pad or lap cooler.  Overall, it is a very nice laptop with reasonable battery life and weight.  Certainly not a light weight but not too heavy.  I would prefer Windows XP over Vista but have found only one program that will not run under the installed Vista Premium (64 bit) operating system.  Regardless Vista improved significantly with SP1 and is not nearly as difficult as it was originally.Initially I was hesitant to purchase from Amazon due to errors in the product specifications information (the screen resolution information was in error).

I mean, REALLY lucky.2) You use it moderately, cutting down the inevitable wear and tear.3) You haven't had it for very long.In the first three months of having this computer, I could've screamed its praises from a sky scraper. And then the honeymoon ended.I will give some positives first: Screen size, clarity and overall display are great. It is relatively easy to navigate through all the functions and accessories.Okay, with that outta the way:I got my laptop customized direct from HP. I spent a small fortune to make sure I had all the speed, memory, and functionality I could want and then some. I got the Blu-Ray drive with lightscribe, upped the graphics, got the 12-cell battery, and upgraded the OS. And for three months, I thought, \"gosh I'm glad I didn't settle and get that macbook.\"After three months, the technical/mechanical glitches began. I needed the dvd/blu-ray drive replaced. The audio program and  panel began interfering with internet connection-- that's just odd. Mouse pad stopped functioning completely and I found out that this happens on these models. To fix it you have to send it away if you're under warranty or pay to replace it on your own. Either way, you're giving up your computer for a while. So I use a wireless mouse. Not by choice.The external power socket... expanded. The cord won't stay in on its own anymore. I literally have to rig it. How's that for janky? Not only janky but since it's hard to rig, charging became more difficult (as the cord would pop out with the slightest movement), and this led to a 12-cell battery losing capacity. What was once 3 hours of unplugged usage time now comes in at about 20 minutes and then without warning it dies. At least it used to warn me so I could save my work!!!I HAD to invest in a wireless mouse, but no way am I spending $ on a new laptop battery or anything else to band-aid the problems this thing has. I've also spent more time than I care to recall troubleshooting these and additional hardware and software issues.I've read a number of reviews of this and similar models and it seems like the same problems arise around the same time. I've had this NB for under two years. . . I am already shopping around for a replacement. It won't be HP. Nothing HP ever, ever again. Heed reviews, people!

After looking on the Internet for \"HP Laptop won't turn on\" I find that this is a very common issue with HP laptops.So her laptop is dead (I suspect the motherboard) and now we have to see how to get it fixed by HP, whose customer support is below mediocre.  Not a good purchase at all, buy a Macbook and run Windows 7 - better hardware and support.UPDATE October 20, 2009: Today I called HP and they told me that they will NOT honor the warranty directly, that I must contact Amazon so they can send the computer to HP, which is ridiculous.

After looking through everything Amazon had to offer, I finally settled on the HP Pavilion HDX18 and I must say I am very pleased! It is an aesthically appealing machine, although I find (because of its glossy features) I must \"polish\" it weekly. A slip jacket is included with this laptop and helps keep the casing scratch-free. That may not be a big deal to some purchasers, but I found it to be a nice little extra. I am also very pleased with the performance of this machine. The finger-print reader is wonderful! The huge 18.4\" high-definition widescreen will impress those of you who can't bear squinting at tiny monitors...and just wait 'till you hear the sound! OMG!!! This laptop offers the best sound I have ever head on any computer. The backwards compatibility to \"a\" and \"g\" Wi-Fi (this computer has wi802.11n Wi-Fi) is another plus...there's no hurry to upgrade your wireless router. Connectivity was painless. The preinstalled software is also nice (Microsoft Works and a trial version of Microsoft Office) for those who don't wish to invest in expensive software right off the the bat, although I uninstalled these programs since I use MS Office 2007 Professional. For many home users, though, MS Works is perfectly adequate. The 500GB hard drive holds tons of software and I've found that in spite of loading many graphics software programs I still have lots of hard drive space left. A word of caution to those of you who have not updated your software...there may be compatibility issues with Vista and/or the 64 bit processor. I was running Adobe Illustrator 9.0 on my old XP machine...but its a \"no go\" on this one. Although it installed OK, when I tried to launch it I got an incompatibility message and it corrupted my Photoshop CS color profiles which required reinstallation of Photoshop. Also, Photoshop Elements 4.0 and Premiere Elements 4.0 are not compatible...so I did incur some additional expense upgrading my software. Oddly, some older games (the Myst series) run just fine, although some people have reported difficulties. I did incur a little glitch the first day I used this computer, but got through to HDX technical support immediately and the problem was resolved in moments. This special HDX technical support phone number appears on a removeable label on the lower-left corner (below the keyboard)...so make a note of it...it will save you lots of waiting time. The weight of this machine is listed as a \"con\" in some reviews, however I do not find this to be a problem. Finding a case is more of a challenge. I purchased the Miltigiant 20 Largest Multi Design Nb Case. It is very large (almost like a small suitcase), but now that I've used it, I like it. It holds lots of extras...headphones, external hard-drive, etc. with room to spare. I only have two negative things to say about this computer (although they would not have prevented my purchase): first, is its lack of a latch to keep the laptop closed and second, one additional USB port would have been nice (my old HP had more USB ports than this one does) and in a world with so many USB peripherals, lots of ports are essential. An inexpensive USB hub took care of this problem. All-in-all, though, this is a great computer...lots of computer at a great value.

I bought one new in Jan (elsewhere) and am buying a 2nd for my wife from Amazon Warehouse (will update review on that when I get May 28 09).Processor- The Intel Quad9000 (their entry level Quad) is a 5 out of 5 star (Intel's rating system)and currently the BEST quad you can get in a laptop. There are EXTREME chips that may be better for gaming. This chip alone costs $1,200 to add when you customize most systems. This is the BEST thing about this system. You will be up to date for at least another year and a half.Screen- This screen is \"true\" 1080 HD resolution -the specs on this page are wrong. I told a Amazon tech on the phone, but they didn't seem to care. 18.4\" with true WIDESCREEN 16x9 (normally it's 16x10). You can't find true 1080 on some machines that cost $1k more.Hard Drive/RAM - 500GB is more than you could possibly need. 4GB is nice, but you may want to add another 2 GB.Graphics Card- The NVIDIA 9600 is really not going to get it done except on low settings for the most demanding games like Crysis. You can try it on low settings, but then your really not getting all the game. This is the worst thing about the machine. If your not going to be playing the most demanding games then there is no worry.Extras- BluRay- Nice to have although I have BluRay players. Fingerprint thing you will use more than you think. The lightscribe is cool, but you need discs that cost twice as much if you want to use that.I researched EVERY option out there and if your looking for a 17\"+ desktop replacement type this is THE BEST you can do at any price unless you customize -which is VERY costly.", "Date": "May 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Unfathomable combination of capability and price...", "Author": "Dave Matthews \"Heron\"", "ReviewID": "RUCBMWMX4SJ98", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok I am not a 'techie' so I won't waste your time with the data specs that make this machine the best.

There are many great things about the laptop I enjoy, but a single major design flaw forces me to not recommend the pc.I bought the pc for the graphics capability. Unfortunately, the laptop can not handle the heat generated from using the higher graphics capabilities. Sure, you can watch videos or play games, but eventually, the PC will over heat and then shut off without notice. Also, try watching a video when the PC heats up to about 150 degrees. It is not very comfortable. I thought buying one of those plastic pads with a usb fan would solve the issue. But, even with the additional cooling capability, the PC will still overheat and shut off. If you do not believe me, then search overheating problems for this PC online. notice in all the responses, not a single word from HP on how to fix the issue. I have even talked to other users with the same PC and they have the same issue.Overall, the HP HDX is a fine machine with lots to like about it. But as I said, the over heating issue should over ride anything else. It's sort of like buying the best car ever built, but has no brakes. You may like every thing else about it, but that single issue means you should never purchase the car.And given HP does not appear to have a fix (thus the cone of silence from them), move on to another maker (apparently, many of the HP's have the issue).", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Detailed problem description.  BUYERS BEWARE!", "Author": "Jeremy R. Higashiyama \"BlackberryJer\"", "ReviewID": "R3NFPLCSWO91J3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I would first like to start out by saying that I take very good care of my computers and I do everything in my power to keep them dust free, dirt free, kept up to maximum performance. Now, I barely got this computer about a year ago, I bought it brand new from HP.  When I first received it in the mail, it looked amazing and had an awesome design.  Right out of the box, I turned it on and when Windows Vista was finished doing the setup for the first start, my volume kept going up and down, my wifi kept turning on and of, and bass and treble kept going up and down.  First thing I though was that there are updates.  I updated all my drivers and the problem still kept continuing.  First thing I did was call HP and it took me an hour to even get to tech-support.  They told me that I needed to send in my laptop under warranty, that right there should of been a sign to return it and I still regret not doing it.  So within 3 days I received a box in the mail to send in my laptop, I sent it in, I got a call a couple days later and received it before the week was through.  By the way, I will give it to HP on being fast as all the other computer companies usually take at least 2 weeks, at least the companies I dealt with.  So I get it back, and the problem stopped happening for a little over a month, but in just 2 months alone, I started seeing problems that put this notebook to shame.  On the top of the list,1. OVERHEATING!!!  Even saying that is an understatement.  When people talk about the notebook being hot and overheating, they aren't kidding.  It has 2 fans, a big one and a little tiny one.  The small one is on the bottom right next to the hard drive.  You can't access it easily to make sure its working or clean it at all.  Then the vent where its sucking air in, is only half its size.  With that being said, the fan works half as effective as a full vent opening would be for it.  Note:  YES, I get this is a more powerful computer, but if it gets so hot at the bottom that your legs are burning, don't you see that as being a problem?  This overheating is just plain ridiculous because, A.  Its not cooling anything off inside if there isn't enough cool air in it, and B, its also causing heat damage to other things, as the air isn't circulating enough in there.  Most people think a lot of us HDX 16 1140US users are over exaggerating this issue, but really, were not.  Right now the current temperatures areGPU: 60CHD: 41CTemp 1: 52CCore 0: 68CCore 1: 67CI also have a notebook cooler  under it, and I used speedfan to find my temps out.  Also it is about 72F in my room right now.Other problems that arise are :2. Battery wouldn't charge3. Screen starts flashing for no reason.4. Touch pad and click buttons started chipping, and the left and right click buttons stopped working and the buttons ended up popping off within a week of each other. Including the double tap.5. HP forgot a bunch of screws when they sent it back to me and the speaker grill keeps popping off.6. They changed the original webcam out with some cheaper cam and when your in a lighter room, the screen for the person seeing you on cam, just turns white.7. The screen gets a whole bunch of dents and scratches because the keyboard keys rub on it.  After HP fixes it, they send you a little note stating that you need to use a little cloth they is sent with your notebook when you first received it to protect it from scratches like that.8. The keyboard keys paint started chipping off too.9. My hard drive took a dump on me while I was in the middle of transfering my stuff to an external drive.  It started making this clicking sound and then a weird beeping sound and then while transferring my stuff over to my external, my computer froze and shut down.10.  Windows Vista.  Vista is a great idea, for a more powerful computer.  If you have Vista loaded on it, then there is no way your going to get any good battery life and performance at the same time.  You have to have it set in high performance if you want to do the simplest of tasks otherwise, its going to be extremely slow.11. HP's customer service, tech-support, and Case Managers.  This is an interesting one for me as I had not spoken to anyone but customer service and a supervisor(Who was the most rude person I have ever dealt with for a computer company) When I called  to ask to speak to someone higher, they opened a case and I had to wait 3 days for a case manager to call me back to explain the problems that have risen since I first received.  He seemed to help me alot and try to get it resolved but, when it came down to finding him to tell him there was a delay with my local FedEx, it was impossible, and they rejected my notebook for warranty repairs when it got there.  As of now, its been just about a year and I have had to many problems that one should deal with in a company as big as HP.  They do not treat their customers well, tech-support is VERY rude because they believe that you don't know anything and thats the reason why your sending your notebook in.In all honesty, yes, when in high performance , it does work fairly well, but if your not into the idea of having a hot laptop,  bad battery life,  or no durability, then I suggest looking into another company such as Toshiba or Sony's Vaio notebooks.All the problems could have been easily fixed if HP wouldn't have put the fan intake in such a horrible spot.  its in the top left hand side and if you have it in your lap, you for sure are going to be blocking it.  The problems that I posted are all  mainly heat issues and when my hard drive died, that really set me off with HP.  My last year of work which took hours upon hours to work on, are now gone because the hard drive pooped out on me.  Right now, I am furious with HP, and will NEVER buy a laptop from them again.For the people that say,\"Backup your work!\"  It's a laptop, not a desktop, its harder for the people that don't stay at a desk all day too do this.  For me alone, I am never using this at a desk when I am at home and rarely use it at home as its my music computer for writing music.Overall that, I will admit there are some pro's.The screen is amazing as its VERY soft on the eyes so it makes it easy to spend an extended amount of time on it without your eyes bugging out and turning all red.  The touch bar works great when its finally working right, the fingerprint reader is GREAT for the ones that try getting into your computer, the keyboard is perfect with the whole number pad on the side making it almost a full sized keyboard, the sound is almost as good as toshiba's notebooks but thats only because they have Harmon/Kardon speakers, also the bass sounds really good compared to the full treble most laptops have, and it runs great with games.  But from now on I will only be buying Toshiba computers as I still to this day have never had a problem like this with them.  Take my advice, spend the extra money to get something that will last longer and run better, these problems are not worth it in the end, and you end up paying over $100.00 for the hard drive when it dies, and I still have to find a touch pad that can replace my current, buttonless one.  Trust me, you'll regret it within a year if you do buy it.  Also, look into HP's notebooks having overheating issues.

Its build quality rivals anything Apple makes. The design is much more stylish than other PC's on the market today. The Geforce 130M GPU with a gig of ram allows this PC to play Crysis at 1280x720 with High settings for everything except Post Processing. Setting Post Processing to low definitely improved the fps. The 18 inch LCD is just plain beautiful at 1920x1080. Once the UAC in Vista was disabled, and the HP software was deleted it's been nothing but good things with this machine. Many other reviews of the HDX18t complained about it being a fingerprint magnet, well it's not that bad. The keyboard has a nice soft feel to it compared to the HP DV7. It's a similar feel to an Apple laptop.Now onto the complaints, as with all laptops the HDX runs hot. It's not too bad when doing basic things; however it will still burn your legs without a cooler or cutting board underneath. If your stove stops working, the HDX will fry an egg while running Crysis. The GPU throws off a ton of heat when worked hard especially through the left side of the keyboard which can burn your fingers after several hours of use. Heat is the biggest enemy of computer hardware, however using the sleep mode greatly helps along with keeping it on a hard surface in an air-conditioned room.

After over two frustrating months I can only report about poor reliability and extremely ineffective service. My new HDX Laptop still has major performance issues and the horizon looks bleak. I am considering making this purchase a total lose in order to save me from wasting many more hours of my time.Out of the box the laptop looked promising. for instance HP decision to scarify proper aspect ratio for the display in order to achieve high resolution at a lower cost seems reasonable (it uses standard HDTV screen rather than WXGA). Immediately it was obvious that performance was mediocre at best in spite of ordering the highest available options for my configuration (processor, memory, hard drive, etc. all superior to the listing above). Documentation was not helpful like directing me to unavailable features and options for the embedded webcam.I failed my first task of connecting my new HP laptop to my new HP printer. It is missing an essential HP driver that apparently was supposed to be install at the factory. After eight weeks and 50 (yes fifty!) hours of my time and similar effort from HP, the only option I have, is to start from scratch and install the initial factory configuration for the software myself. Since it takes numerous hours to proceed the inital configuration with missing updates, software configuration choices, installation of my own software, etc., I wonder if I should invest any more time in this computer. At this moment, the reason for the faulty factory installation is not on HP service map yet (likely a faulty sector on my new hard drive). Thus my odds to continue a long expensive path in reviving my sick new computer looks high.Since we are at the age of paying relatively little for much functionality and performance one must face the high probability of requiring support. If you like to follow excessive useless long laundry instruction lists (looked canned to me) of re-installing existing software that works fine, email HP Support and ask for help. If you enjoy long aimless frustrating discussions with mostly nice people but with lack of knowledge, ability, responsibility, or authority (probably the combination of all), than buy HP products. I can assure you that you will meet many people from the Philippines and India with various impressive job titles.While generating a rich set of service records, I was wandering how can HP afford to spend so much time and effort with a single customer on a single product with very low profit margin. Perhaps that is the reason why HP cut corners more aggressively than others.
