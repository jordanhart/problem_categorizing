Let me break it down.Pros:Powerful (not top of the line, but powerful) gaming machineEverything runs smoothBig, bright screenComfortable keyboardCooling boostCons:Windows 8Small left shift keyEverything is pretty much self explanatory here.I played Tera on it for about 3 hours, and it didn't even start to get as hot as my other laptop, which turns into a lava pit at the mere mention of \"Netflix.\" Didn't even have to use the cooling boost option, which is fantastic by the way.Overall, I'm happy. I'll update if anything goes wrong, but I doubt it will.Edit: It is now Day 2. I noticed that the charger gets incredibly hot when used for a few hours. My old laptop didn't do that, though my old laptop didn't game, either. Not sure how bad this is, but its something to keep in mind. Also, the cooling boost option is fantastic. The laptop would probably die without it.Edit: It's been a while since i got this laptop, but less than a month. I haven't dropped it or treated it with anything less than the utmost care, and now when i rest my hand on the bottom right corner of the laptop, it makes a clicking noise, as though something came loose. I am not sure if this is serious, or if it will lead to more serious problems, but i am disappointed.[Update!] Its been less than a year (I think) since I bought this laptop,and the motherboard has failed. Fantastic. Not sure if my unit was just defective, or if they're all like that, but I'm now left with a $1000 brick.UPDATE UPDATE. So, the problem was with the multicontroller. Essentially, the power board broke. I got it fixed and everything is fine now, but its still kind of shady that this happened.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Quality Gaming Laptop", "Author": "Alex Sigrist", "ReviewID": "RZNT7NRIM4HEC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the MSI GE60 about 2 and a half weeks ago and have yet to find a complaint about it. It's truly lived up to its expectations as a gaming laptop! Here are a few things about this laptop I find worthy of mention.Exterior Surfaces:Sleek finish on the casing makes the laptop appear much more professional than other gaming laptops, which I find to be a plus. The wrist resting surface on the inside is comfortable and doesn't get hot with the laptop (which doesn't happen much!)Monitor:A standard 1920x1080 pixel resolution display on a 15.6\" screen makes the picture clear at a very close viewing distance. Something deceptive about the larger laptops is that they can actually spread out the pixels on the larger screen when they have the same resolution display making the image appear worse when you're at the close distance you'd expect to have in a laptop. The screen is exceptionally bright (moreso than my last laptop) and I haven't experienced any glare on the screen from artificial or sun light. Viewable at a wide range of viewing angles as well.Keyboard:To my surprise the keyboard has a full numberpad which was an adjustment but definitely a plus for me in the long run. However, this pushed the arrow keys into the right shift key which makes it a bit small. There's also no \"function\" key on the right side of the keyboard, requiring two hands to adjust the volume or screen brightness. The keyboard by SteelSeries (great gaming accessory company; I ordered a mouse pad from them a few months back) feels very sharp and precise with key presses and has a satisfying weight to each key. The LED illumination is different for me, but it happens to match the LEDs in my mouse :P For some reason there's a 2nd LED setting that illuminates only the far left side of the keyboard (probably for the standard gaming keys of WASD ZXCV etc)Touchpad:Responsive, logical usage, perhaps a little *too* sensitive to taps as I've accidentally clicked while trying to use it. A bit of a negative is the inability (at least for me) to use the mousepad while a USB mouse is plugged in. Probably a feature, but to me seems illogical.Cooler Booster or whatever it's called:What a great feature!! If you just wanna keep your laptop cooled even further with regular use, push the button to turn it on and away goes the heat! It says 15% cooling increase but the heat it pumps out from the side is amazing with it on! Big plus!Processor:i7 processor is of course the greatest of Intel right now. 2.4 GHz isn't laughable, but when you can overclock to 3.3 GHz without any adverse effects (or even extra heat!!) it's pretty amazing especially on a laptop of this size. Remarkably fast processor that has drastically reduced load times. As an avid League of Legends player, I went from the last to load in, to the first to load in every time.Nvidia Geforce Graphics Card:I still haven't figured out how to manually switch between the intel graphics chip and the nvidia card, but automatic settings have worked fabulously. Any game I launch, I immediately go into settings and crank everything up to max. Everything I've ran runs at 60 FPS stable still. 2 GB of graphics memory is huge. Great to have on a laptop!! I'm curious how it would run something like BF3 but I don't own it :/Sound Blaster Cinema:WOW this laptop has some sound behind it. Comparable to leading sound systems for laptops this thing packs quite the punch. Max volume is WAYYYY too loud for any setting. The Sound Blaster settings make sounds in music, movies, and games (separate settings for each type) sound as they should with crystal sound quality. Huge bonus to have as well.Killer Network Manager:I don't know what it does still. I've actually suspected that it unfairly shares download bandwidth and hogs it to a single application (for example I couldn't watch Youtube at all because my other downloads were running at my max download speed). When I opened the application, hardly anything was displayed and there were only like two settings for me that did nothing. I think being on wireless has prevented a lot of this feature from working. Wired connections may experience something different. I haven't found any latency improvements in game (if anything my ping has gone up)Battery Life:Seems good to me. Have to remember to stay at 2.4 GHz on the processor because 3.3 will destroy the battery very quickly!! I'd say you could get 3-4 hours of movie watching on a single charge with medium brightness.Windows 8:It's certainly different. And designed for a tablet which is kinda dumb for a computer with a mouse... But I hardly use the start screen anyway. The Desktop can run everything on its own. I only used the start screen the first day to test out all the smart apps (which are a bit slow for my taste and have a terrible graphical layout) and install google chrome from Internet Explorer.Quality for Price:I paid $1199 when I purchased it. For this price, this laptop was an excellent buy for me. At retail price, maybe not such a great deal, but still a quality laptop that will offer all the power you could want or need for gaming. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high end gaming laptop.", "Date": "July 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop overall but one lingering issue", "Author": "Garrett", "ReviewID": "R1WF2EI8GZGT5D", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had this laptop for just over 2 months and it has run everything I have thrown at it marvelously.

However, I only payed $1,300 and got an extended 3-year warranty (which I don't see myself using due to the build quality)Pros: -Decent performance as a gaming/work laptop. I haven't had issues running high end software such as AutoDesk Inventor.  -Windows 8. It's quick, easy to use, and boots within seconds.  -Full-size keyboard. I dislike having keys with multiple functions (ie: pressing the Function key to use delete). The GE60 has a full keyboard that is comfortable and surprisingly open,  including a numpad.Cons: -Poor battery life. Lasts 2.5 hours if I put it in power saving mode and less than 1.5 if in Performance mode with 3D-intense software running.I highly suggest buying this laptop along with a compatible 9-cell replacement battery.", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop for the price", "Author": "Mark", "ReviewID": "R3Q2GDNTGBD3C2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "So, I was looking at upgrading from my 2010 macbook pro to something with a little more power that could play games, edit photos/videos and that wouldn't be outdated in several months. I did a lot of research into MSI for my girlfriends GT70 and was pretty happy with the results, so, I decided to invest in one myself.I've had it for three days now and I must say it's a very nice laptop. The graphics aren't as good as my ATI 7970, but they're able to run Tomb Raider on ultra and that's all I could really ask for. The start up speed is reasonable, lots of HD space, and 8gb of ram isn't too shabby. The back-lit keyboard is alright, it only has three options: on, half on, off. And the different levels of lighting aren't amazing. The sound is great, and the ethernet card is very, very fast. The HD screen looks amazing, and the quality/feel of the keys is very nice.The touchpad, however, feels very cheap. That is something I'm not in love with at all. I feel if I press it too hard it will move and become stuck out of position. With such a nice keyboard you would think the touchpad would match, but it doesn't.So, if you're a tl;dr type of person, here is my quick summary.The good:+Solid Keyboard+Good Graphics at Pricepoint+Great Quality Display+Fast ethernet+Relatively Lightweight+Amazing sound (better than expected)+Solid FeelThe Bad:-Cheapy cheap touchpad-lack luster backlight keybaord-Windows 8 (I had to troubleshoot an error right after I booted it up...)-Slow hard drive (start up/shut down a bitttt slow, but that can be fixed with SSD)-Small ass right shift keyOverall:It is a really good buy at the price. I kinda wish I got the GT70 with the nvidia 770m, but oh well. This laptop will do what I need it to do, feels solid, and besides the hiccup with Windows 8 (which I've customized since startup, and now it feels great) I'm hoping that this laptop goes the distance and lasts me a couple years. Definitely would recommend buying.", "Date": "February 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly", "Author": "J", "ReviewID": "R3DMZY8RX4BIUY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Ugly:I had this laptop for about a month and started to notice that the WIFI was dropping constantly. After many lost hours and days trying to talk to MSI's useless customer service, installing BIOS updates, new drivers, old drivers, smashing my head against the wall, I finally just reset the thing. After that, and some fumbling here and there I have it working well now. It drops now and then but I chalk that up to the networks I am on because I have talked to others that have has some issues with the networks I use...Basically, this was a MAJOR problem that I fixed. It is likely a 1 in a million type deal that you have this problem out of the box so I don't want this to sway your decision on whether or not you get it. I just had to include this for an unbiased review.The Bad:The trackpad. It actually works quite good when it comes to responsiveness and all of the two finger, three finger, and gesture capabilities. The size is great and once you tweak the settings to your liking, navigating the large screen resolution is as good as it should be (though nothing beats a good old fashioned mouse in my opinion).What is bad about it is that it feels terrible. There are two built in click buttons on the bottom of the trackpad, where two separate buttons are on many other/older laptops. This design itself is not an issue but the tolerances they used for it are terrible. The touchpads moves up and down about 1/8\" and make a sort of spring noise when released. Then, you push on it the rest of the way to click on the buttons themselves. It works perfectly fine, it just sounds terrible and feels a mushy due to the play in it.The LED Indicator lights are just way too bright on the front of the laptop. The sleep light blinks bright and fast, annoying the hell out of you if you are in a dark room! A piece of electrical tape over 75% or so of the light fixed that. Now I just see the tops of them so they are much dimmer but bright enough for any indoor use. I am very picky about things I own so normally this would bug me but the tape is hidden due to the curvature of the bottom of the laptop so it doesn't bother me.The Good:The keyboard is the best typing experience I have ever had on a laptop. Period. The Steelseries keyboard is so responsive that it even makes the apple keyboards feel mushy. There is no doubt that you have or haven't hit a key. The best part is that it has a number pad, something I use greatly when inputting math problems for college online.The case design, function, and the ergos are all to be expected. It is basically a run of the mill laptop in this regard. Nothing flashy really just decent quality with some nice aluminum on the touchpad area and keyboard outer rim. It is constructed well just not fancy.Gaming: It is a monster. Period. Plays Far Cry 3 at respectable levels. I can pull 35-40FPS on High settings, albeit with most of the aliasing and other graphics settings off. I am by no means a hard core gamer so if you are anything more than a casual gamer you may want to find someone who knows more about the gaming portion of this to give you an opinion on its gaming performance. From what I have read it is better than the Alienware 14 (uncustomized) at gaming...though again it doesn't really concern me.Battery Life:To be expected. 3-4 hours. I wish it were more just because I am very mobile with it but it is a gaming laptop, not a macbook friggin air...It isn't supposed to be good on battery! That being said it wakes up from sleep mode so fast that I have programmed the power button to put it to sleep when pressed and use that to help save a lot of battery when I am not going too look at it for a few minutes but don't want to turn it off either.Notes: For some reason I cannot game with the power unplugged. It will drop the frame rates down to practically nothing. I am told from MSI that all gaming laptops are like this but I don't really know. Realistically, you would get maybe 45-60 min of gaming anyway so it doesn't really seem like it is worth killing your battery for that anyway.Overall I like the laptop. It does the occasional gaming, video editing (it is a monster at video editing)and all of the other homework tasks that I need it to due well. It is the best value PC with these specs of any I can find and for the price you don't really sacrifice much of anything.

As other reviews have mentioned, the touchpad leaves some to be desired, but for the most part, this point is moot for me as I typically use a USB wireless mouse with my laptops.  Bought this for my oldest son, he's been wanting something to game on, and his current i3 with integrated graphics just can't do that.  I have a Sony VPCF233FX, i7 @2.2GHz, boosts to 3.1 GHz, it has DDR3 1333 8 GB RAM and an Nvidia Geforce GT540M with 1GB dedicated video memory.  I am using the Sony as comparison to this MSI laptop.Screen is nearly identical between the two, both excellent.  Processor speed is hard to gauge here. What shines is the video card.  The GTX765M is a huge improvement over the GT540M. We both play World of tanks, with the GT540M, video settings on low, I can reach in the upper 40's for FPS.  With this MSI and the GTX765M, using settings of medium, it hits in the upper 60's for FPS.After converting all my desktops and my Sony laptop to an SSD, I had forgotten just how slow a HDD really is.  Even though this comes with a 7200rpm HDD, it still is the one glaring weak spot.  Fortunately this MSI laptop does come with two mSata ports and from what I gather, they will accept either 128GB or 256GB mSata drives and will perform RAID 0 if you choose to use two drives.  Plan is to add an mSata drive to speed this process up.Comes with a two year limited warranty, a quick setup guide, another guide to walk you through a system restore and a Utilities DVD.  As mentioned in other comments, the backlit keyboard can be turned off, all on, or only the left side on (I assume this is for those gaming in the dark as it lights the usual keys required for gaming.  Not much bloatware.  As always, with windows 8, you can upgrade free to windows 8.1 at the 'Microsoft' store online.  It's about a 3.2GB download.  Initial setup will take some time with reboots, also upgrading to windows 8.1 will take some time to install as well (aside from the obvious download time).I had seen someone mention that you have to update the NVidia drivers through MSI as they apparently had issue using the standard NVidia drivers, but I did not find this to be the case.  Works with Geforce experience as well.  Sound is good for a laptop.If you can buy this from Amazon and get their price, its a great deal, although they do show the retail price to be too high, MSI says this laptop retails for 1299.00.

This can play games.  I've been playing splinter cell blacklist recently and it plays great.  I also have mirror's edge, bf3, borderlands 2, and others.  They are all very playable and look quite nice, better than the last gen consoles.  Haven't used the xbox one or ps4 yet, so I can't attest to those.I use some cpu intensive programs.  This has a good cpu.  I produce a lot of music in fl studios, this has had 0 problems with that.  Not even a hiccup.  I play around with a lot of media, photos and videos.  I use photoshop on this laptop, and it has been very smooth.  You can do video editing on this, but you probably don't want to do a ton of crazy stuff like 3d rendering or after effects kind of stuff.  If you want to do a lot of that, you should probably get a desktop anyway.Keyboard backlight.  First of all, the keyboard is nice.  I really like the steelseries.  The keys feel nice and the backlighting is nice.  Nice to type on.  Keep in mind, people say that the keyboard is a pain to replace.  I haven't had to deal with that, so I don't know.What I wish was betterBattery life.  When not plugged in, the batter will last a few hours.  I'd say 3.  Then again, this is a gaming laptop.3rd party software.  Comes with weird software.  I just deleted most of it.  Not a big deal.Windows 8.  Just meh for me.  This laptop doesn't have a touch screen so windows 8 isn't gonna give you much there.  I generally just go straight to the desktop and never touch the windows 8 panel page, whatever it is called.  But again, this isn't a big deal.  Don't dismiss this just because it has windows 8.  It's not a bad os, it just doesn't have advantages that I've noticed over windows 7 in this case.To conclude, if you want a powerful (semi-portable) laptop, that can play games and complete cpu intensive tasks, this is a great laptop.  Get this, or something similar.  If you need only to browse the internet, make word documents, spreadsheets, and play casual games, I recommend you opt for something without a dedicated gpu, something lighter, thinner, something with better battery life and more portable all around.
