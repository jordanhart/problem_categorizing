Kieser", "ReviewID": "R2QLCWOQGXVV58", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased a refurbished Dell Lattitude D630 from Tampa in July of 2012.  It came very quickly and I was pleased that the computer was better than advertised. It came with windows 7, a larger hard drive and a RW DVD drive - all of which were not part of the deal.  After making the mistake of installing McAfee (which caused all sorts of conflicts)and then uninstalling it and restoring the computer, all was great.  Then in the early days of September, a bizarre problem occured where the display starting tiling in two columns miniature images of the desktop.  Occasionally, it would boot up correctly but not often.  The folks at Tampa happily replaced the computer for me but saved the hard drive from the defective unit which saved me hours of rebuilding the unit.  And did this exchange in a week. Top marks for these folks!", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dell Latitude D630 14.1\" Laptop", "Author": "JuanCarlosGomez", "ReviewID": "R22BW73W3X5KYI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this Laptop D630, 14.1 inches, because I needed a small computer to take on my trips. It worked for about one week, then it gouldn't turn on! Also, it was creating so much heat coming out from the CPU heat sink. Since I'm a technician, I made some repair on it, chainging 3 SMD Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors (Aluminum body devices located around the heat sink) and replacing the CPU heat sink thermal grease, applying new  \"Arctic Silver 5 3.5G Polysynthetic Silver Thermal Grease Compound\" to CPU Heat Sink.

It has good enough speed for my purposes, which is mainly surfing the net with a little consulting. It comes without instructions but is easy to figure out.

When it arrived it had apparently been damaged in shipping - but I didn't know enough to know that. It didn't help me that I started working with it on a Friday night and Tampa-Laptops was not open on the weekend, nor are they open after 5pm Eastern time.  Since I work full-time it was difficult to connect with the supplier to help me determine what the problem was. It worked sometimes and sometimes would lock up or shut down.  Then it started working so I loaded software - but then it really locked up. My daughter was really disappointed.  I have a friend who is a Dell Engineer who helped me find out how to diagnose the problem which ended up being a hard drive issue.  I did return it to Tampa-Laptops who either fixed it or replaced the hard drive.  Even though I asked them I'm still not clear what they did.  I received this computer yesterday, about a month after my initial purchase, and it booted right up and appears to be running well so far.  It is an older model and does heat up quite a bit compared to my newer HP but for the price it seems to work well and the display is very crisp.", "Date": "March 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "Dell Latitude D630", "Author": "Woodman", "ReviewID": "R2Q3VPRNZ50WDL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Unit was shipped as stated.

It's inexpensive, not that heavy, and performs wonderfully. I bought it with Windows XP SP3 (I like a stable OS so screw Vista, 7,8, or 9) and it came with good software. The powercord was in great condition, the battery has full life with each charge, and they included a system restore disk.I installed my own preferred software with no problems. It does run a little warm when using flash applications such as some online games, but the fan works well. The speakers are good, the wifi and bluetooth work well, and I have yet to experience any problems. When it comes time to upgrade or purchase an additional computer I am checking out Tampa-Laptops again. I'd recommend this computer to anyone except gamers (who will need something a bit faster with better graphics) but for a college student, high school student, or working stiff this is an excellent choice.", "Date": "February 2, 2014"}, {"Title": "does everything I need", "Author": "Janet Atkinson - Q15J", "ReviewID": "R1TD3XOSYT780D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good sturdy reliable laptop will fit all my needs - got tired of the Android interface and quirks it carried", "Date": "December 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Steve Grey \"Steve Grey\"", "ReviewID": "R1SMDRDITTUOEU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Nothing I have ever bought with the Dell  name on it has ever disappointed me.
