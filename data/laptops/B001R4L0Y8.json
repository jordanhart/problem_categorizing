But this computer gave me everything I had in my $1,000 laptop, in a MUCH smaller, cheaper package.Keyboard size is excellent, speed is fantastic for word processing, emails, spreadsheets, etc. I got the upgraded screen w/higher resolution and the 6 cell battery since I travel and present a lot. Love the PCI slot and VGA port - a must for business use.Pros: small, compact, cheap, fastCons: trackpad is small (would rather have had an eraser style mouse)", "Date": "April 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "great little machine", "Author": "... \"esizzle\"", "ReviewID": "R3MFDUA6HK2GOY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am going to state that this is no replacement for a desktop or laptop.How ever it is a great supplementary item that is very portable and lightweight.It is a great tool for taking notes in class, which is what I use it for, and for surfing the net. Comparing this to other notebooks the keyboard is better than many others I have seen, but it is still not completely full sized, that and the fact that the touch pad is not very large is why I gave this four stars. This machine is not as powerful as a laptop and does not have the best graphics card to conserve power so the battery realistically lasts 3 to four hours depending on the power settings. It is a fun machine to surf the net with and can do many basic functions, the built in web cam is cool for skype as well. The machine itself feels solid, unlike a cheaply made notebook that would crack easily. The case feels like metal but for all I know it could be a fake metal made of plastic, either way it is solid and looks cool.Hope this review helps and good luck deciding on what to get.", "Date": "April 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "This machine comes with XP SP2 installed", "Author": "P.

Took me one day to get it work by downloading the drivers from the web, and upgrade the OS to the latest patches.1024x576 resolution is also a problem for some software --- It is not with enough width.  When installing or running some software, the 'OK' and 'Cancel' buttons are 'below' the viewable screen.  you just have to use the tab key and guess when you may hit 'OK' to continue.  And some software (e.g. VPN) just refuse to be installed to this PCs with this kind of resolution.Also, is $500+ price too high now?", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love my new HP 2140", "Author": "Richard D.

The keyboard is not cramped feeling, I love the WiFi N and especially love the ExpressCard slot.  I've already used my Verizon KPC-680 ExpressCard for easy access on the road.  The netbook is a little pricey compared to other netbooks, but, the features are there to validate the expense.

Oh, and affordability -- I don't like paying $1900 for a tiny version of a Sony vaio.I first tried buying a 9\" Asus, which was astonishingly portable -- but it was way too small to be practical, so I gave it to my 7 year old niece. I then got an Acer Aspire One that had a better keyboard but which still was slightly too small. The niece will get this one too.The HP 1000 series struck me as having the perfect keyboard, and I decided to get the 2140 because it has a classy aluminum case and some ruggedness.It's taken me a while to get used to the smaller screen. But I've finally started using it and adjusting to it. And it's giving me all the basic functionality I need, with great portability and the kind of aesthetics that make you proud to own it.", "Date": "September 2, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "2GB 160GB 10.1IN WVB/XPP 3 CELL", "Name": "HEWLETT HP 2140 Mini-Note - Atom N270 / 1.6 GHz - RAM 2 GB - HDD 160 GB - GMA 950 - Gigabit Ethernet - WLAN : Bluetooth 2.0 EDR, 802.11 a/b/g/n (draft) - Loaded with Microsoft XP Pro", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41wwnljK5yL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B001R4L0Y8"}}
