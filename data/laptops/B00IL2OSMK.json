Do yourself a favor & RUN SCREAMING from this.I bought the HP 15-d035dx 15.6\" Laptop PC - Intel Pentium, 2 days ago from Best Buy and have wasted the entire weekend trying to fix it's myriad of problems. I've had to call the HP Support line 5 times & they are TERRIBLE.Their phone lines all have this low hiss in the background which makes them hard to hear- PLUS they have super hard accents (from the Philippines or wherever) that makes their English hard to understand!It seemed like a great deal for a good price ($329), with the bundled wireless mouse, slip case & flash drive & Intel chip. But the computer was slow and got even slower as the day wore on. When I called tech support they deleted mysterious 'unwanted files' (why would they be on a new computer?), and that helped a little. The 2nd day the thing was CRAWLING SLOW. Totally dysfunctional. This time they said there were more Unwanted Files and that even tho' I use Firefox they needed to update Internet Explorer, which they said was slowing it down. (?!).Then a few hours later the thing was frozen completely! They had me take out the battery, did more 'maintenance', etc. The lady rep said I shouldn't use Firefox because it was dangerous! I demanded to speak to her supervisor who said she was WRONG. He said if the problem returns  they may need to re-install my operating system. This is totally unprofessional for a new laptop.Anyway, they got the laptop limping along again & I worked on a long article using \"Open Office\" (equivalent to \"Word\"). About an hour later the laptop completely FROZE again! After 1/2 hour I re-started it & it was still frozen, PLUS every letter and punctuation mark in my article had been replaced by hundreds pound signs!I spent MANY HOURS on the phone with HP Support as well as ATT Support- THIS HAS BEEN A MASSIVE WASTE OF TIME & EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT. I'm going to return THIS PIECE OF JUNK to Best Buy for a full refund & look for something else!", "Date": "March 31, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very Good Laptop", "Author": "Robert Hurt", "ReviewID": "R3SMJ417DVBI44", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a Very Good Laptop for anyone age 12 - 85. Very easy to manage. May get frozen a few times, if overworked. Wouldn't use it as a power computer. Use it lightly, but as long as you like. Won it on eBay for $249, and it's worth like 350, so I was skeptical, but it is a terrific laptop! Plenty of storage room, but only 4 GB of RAM, so freezes may be frequent.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Wonderful", "Author": "Laura K.", "ReviewID": "RR6811MOX4NY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great laptop!

Graham", "ReviewID": "R2SXPUHQWM7KMR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The computer has a lot of glitches in it.  It's as though it was shipped loaded with viruses.  I have tried 4 different browsers and they all are either slow or the web sites don't come up at all.  I get the circle that goes round and round when a web site is trying to load.  And the pop ups are driving me crazy!  I even checked off stop popups in the Explorer specs, and I am still receiving them.  I am going to try to get technical support to help me with this, but I have never had a new computer act so badly as this one.  I want my money back.", "Date": "May 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good to go!", "Author": "Joao Trotta Borges", "ReviewID": "R3PTLJDX7JP78T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good notebook for simple tasks (everything but gaming and video editing).

I had some issues with this when I bought it,mainly with hd video.but after ai did a clean re install it worked fine,  i would recommend if you dont like win 8 or havent used it yet to skip it and get win 7 if you can afford it(i cannot unfortunately).after i did the re install it has performed better and i am able to do some gaming,like civ 5, without any upgrading.  if you want to use programs instead of apps it will consume some time to install programs and switch out the preferences.  hardware wise this is a good machine,honestly the only knock i have against it is win 8.  it looks nice, has a nice case and is on the lighter side of a laptop for this size.  i also like the plug on this laptop, the power port is not as flimsy as i have seen on some laptops,such as the toshibas my sis and mom have, the processor is a quad core and while it isnt an i7, it is good for multitasking and provides enough speed. the battery is nice as well,not only is it small but it is removable. the only drawback hardware wise on this laptop is that it has a single plug for mics and headphones,instead of having two(one for each).i use my laptop for web surfing,some games like civ 5 and grand theft auto, office work, and video streaming.just be sure if you uy this to do a clean installl and remove all the bloatware,will allow the laptop to work much better.", "Date": "April 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Awesome laptop for the price!!", "Author": "Jeff Werner", "ReviewID": "R32NUICKSM8LYO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "purchased yesterday all set up and ready to roll so far so good, faster than expected and display is gorgeous!!", "Date": "April 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for what I need", "Author": "vee", "ReviewID": "R19BIVHAGF1QWT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love the HP brand and this laptop is great for all my needs, it has enough memory, windows 8 and all the features I was looking for, find it is quick to respond, once I got used to the setup and how it all worked, I was not used to Windows 8, I am really enjoying it.

When reading my gmail or watching youtube the display and mouse froze. Could not even access task manager. Had to force shutdown with power button. This happened three times even after doing a reset. I returned to store and got another unit, same model. Same thing happened. Spent hours on phone with HP support, very polite but no solution. Get this: HP support had me do a factory reset (via F11 button during startup); after the reset the desktop had the ASUS logo on it! No one at HP or Best Buy knew (or admitted to) these problems ever happening before. Am I supposed to believe I got the only two units with this problem?I returned it to Best Buy. The supervisor refused to upgrade me to a better unit for the same price despite my hours of problems. He also said I am lucky to be able to return the unit at all because otherwise I'd be stuck with it. (I returned it well within their 15 day limit). I almost walked out but I needed a laptop so I paid $349 for an ASUS laptop; my 4th laptop from Best Buy in three weeks.", "Date": "April 12, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$449.99", "Features": "Intel Pentium Processor N3520 2.17GHz with Turbo Boost up to 2.42GHz\n15.6\" LED-backlit high-definition display / Intel HD graphics\n4GB DDR3L SDRAM / 750GB Hard Drive\nMultiformat DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW / HP TrueVision high-definition webcam\nWindows 8.1 64-bit / 802.11b/g/n WLAN", "Name": "HP 15-d035dx 15.6\" Laptop PC - Intel Pentium N3520 / 4GB Memory / 750GB HD / DVD\u00b1RW/CD-RW / HD Webcam / 802.11b/g/n / Windows 8.1 64-bit", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/511kisuX8CL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00IL2OSMK"}}
