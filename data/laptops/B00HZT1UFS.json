{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great laptop for my 8 yr old son", "Author": "M. Lee", "ReviewID": "R48F3EKMPIO5G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am truly surprised at what this laptop can do. My son uses it for a combination of games, educational websites and learning programs. It definitely does everything he wants it to do. He plays Lego games (including the newer Lego Movie and Lego Marvel Superheroes) on it, MineCraft, Club Penguin.A lot of people are complaining about Windows 8, but my 8 year old son has zero issues figuring out how to get around Windows 8. So not sure what that says about the complainers. Windows 8 is an OS that was really built with tablets in mind and I fully admit it doesn't always lend itself well to laptops for certain purposes. However this laptop actually has a pretty responsive touchscreen and it makes navigating Windows 8 easier.Overall all very surprised about the power this laptop possesses. The Celeron processor has come a long way. This one is dual core. The 4GB of RAM is a decent amount. You won't find a cheaper new true laptop out there. Surprisingly it doesn't feel as cheap as its price tag.If you are expecting a workhorse laptop that will be used for business and hardcore gaming then you just aren't being realistic for $300. If you are comparing it to a $1200-2000 MacBook you are just insane. It's a $300 laptop, plain and simple. But that said, an amazing value for the price.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great value for price", "Author": "Rose L.", "ReviewID": "R26GEIYQOK8M5I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a 300 odd dollar netbook - it's not going to have all the features of the spendier laptops.  I get about 5-6 hours of battery life.  I bought it for a work laptop, it's small and lightweight which is great for travel. Keyboard is large enough - sometimes they can feel quite crammed on the small laptops.  Perhaps some people think it's slow - I have had no issues, again - it's a $300ish laptop - not some professional grade or gaming pc.Only downside for me is that my other laptop's keyboard is more sensitive, so it takes some getting used to - making sure all my letters show up.  I believe that's user issue, not a laptop problem.", "Date": "April 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop With a Fatal Flaw", "Author": "Dennis Hendrix", "ReviewID": "R19ZWV2UM901RA", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE 051914 -This is NOT just an issue with the laptop I ordered.  I went to a Fry's Electronics store to check out this laptop, and perhaps buy another one.  Fortunately they had one on display.  At first I thought it wasn't having the \"jittery cursor\" issue...until I realized it wasn't plugged in to a power source, but was running off battery.  I plugged the power cord in and, lo and behold, a jittery cursor just like the laptop I ordered.  I'm sure this one had the latest drivers, I've tamed it somewhat using the Elan driver mentioned above.=============UPDATE 051614 -Just some info for other people dealing with this touchpad issue, those who perhaps can't return this laptop.  Using the Elan touchpad driver 11.7.8.5 I have made the issue more tolerable, although still not perfect.  There are settings to change sensitivity of the touchpad which you may find helpful.=============I've never been so disappointed with a computer.  This laptop runs great, has plenty of space and the touchscreen works quite nicely.  Unfortunately the touchpad is a spastic mess.I've never seen a touchpad behave in the manner this one does.  It's jittery, jumpy, spastic, erratic.  You hold your finger still, and it jumps and shakes about.  Trying to stop the cursor on things is far more difficult.  This doesn't happen all of the time, making it a nightmare to diagnose, and it seems worse when it's plugged in.  But I've seen it happen while running on battery as well.  Customer service told me to update BIOS and drivers, which I did without result.  I don't know what else I can do, so I will probably have to return it.", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "great cheap ultrabook alternative", "Author": "Grant R. Johnson", "ReviewID": "RVBBC9O3IYMUG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this because I had 2 laptops go out on me in a matter of days. Both of which were from 2006. I wanted something extremely mobile, fast, cheap, and has a touchscreen. I like the specs on \"ultrabooks\" but the price is just out of the question for me. I did quite a bit of research and eventually narrowed it down to either this or the asus TA100 convertable tablet. For my needs I felt I would not be using it as a tablet, but as a netbook with it docked 95% of the time.Reasons I bought this over the TA100-$100 cheaper than 32GB w/500GB HDD (which bought a 120GB SSD)-Baytrail celeron vs baytrail atom (celeron is more powerful CPU and especially GPU)-less cramped keyboard-3 usb ports vs 1-full linux (ubuntu 14.04) support of the box (disable secureboot in bios on startup)-4GB ram upgradeable to 8GB-64bit vs 32bit UEFI (most people won't care, or notice, but for those things that need it, should be noted)-upgradeable internal storeage (possible with HDD dock, but not onboard)-decent touch padsome things that you loose-3-4 hours battery life per charge-slightly bulkier design than T100 w/ HDD dock-bluetooth-ability to be a tablet w/o dock-MS office student license keyThe screen size difference of 1 1/2 inches is probably my least concern but I can't say it's a possitve or a negative, just different.Very first thing I did after getting this was removed the 5400RPM HDD and replaced with a samsung evo 120GB SDD and installed ubuntu 14.04 on it because I would rather die than be stuck with windows 8. It should also be mentioned that ubuntu or windows 7 on the TA100 is a non-starter for lots of different reasons. Mostly drivers, or incompatiblity with 32bit UEFI. So unless you really don't care or actually like windows 8, then you're stuck with that on the TA100 for the foreseeable future.Computer cold boots in less than 10 seconds, is super snappy, plays games like minecraft on slightly above minimum settings. Installed starbound and was playable, but not great. Haven't tried too many native games, but if you install linux and steam you can stream your games over wifi from a windows gaming desktop. I played a game of league of legends, some skyrim, and diablo 3, all of which were in highest settings on my desktop, looked great, fairly fluid and not horrible lag, definitely enjoyable for sure. So getting this as a true extension to a gaming desktop is really great.general computing performance is great, exactly what you would want. Fast browsing, fast application load times (with SSD) no lag, just a great 2014 netbook with close to ultrabook performance and form factor. It gets warm (maybe 100 degrees F) only had the fan go on once during gaming testing and only knew it was on by feeling the air. Comfortable to have on your lap for extended use.my only complaints is that it's not wireless n, and bluetooth would have been nice but with 3 usb ports, just get a micro dongle. If I didn't have to disasemble the freaking thing to get to the HDD or battery/ram it would have been nice, but how often do you need to do these things? All in all, fantastic purchase, would have paid $500 for this with a 120/250GB SSD, but at $300 and the ability to do the upgrade myself with the savings, plus I get a 500GB out of the deal to slap into a external enclosure is a great deal IMO.typed this review from this, and the keyboard is fantastic.", "Date": "May 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice travel Laptop and much better performance after upgrading HDD to SSD", "Author": "R.

ASUS K200MA Touchscreen Laptop is quite similar to other 11.6 inch laptops in size and appearance, except that it is a bit chunkier and has a textured case which is easy to grip.  Build quality is good and it feels fairly solid in the hand, weighing in at about 3 lbs.The touchscreen and touchpad are fairly responsive and the RAM and processor are adequate for a small portable, not aggravating, though certainly not zippy.  The standard keyboard is responsive but has no backlighting.The screen is attractive if not very bright even on the highest setting, but in return, the 3,000 mAh battery life is over five hours after cycling the battery once.  The AC adapter and plug are combined and the wall wart is fairly slim.The camera and speakers are very functional.  Sound quality is above average for a laptop in this price range.  There is the standard 3.5mm audio jack for headphones or external speakers.The hard drive is partitioned with 258 GB available for user data.  That's a significant amount in light of the ubiquitousness of cloud storage.There is an ethernet jack, often missing from similar portables, and of course Wi-Fi, although no Bluetooth.  I frequently use Bluetooth accessories such as speakers and mice and am a bit puzzled by this omission.There are VGA and HDMI ports and two USB 2.0 ports, but only one USB 3.0 port.I am not fond of Windows 8.1, but this computer at least shipped with a current system that required minimal updates.  Every time that touch keyboard pops up on the touchscreen just above the physical keyboard, my mind boggles.  Why?  I also spend a lot of time starting over in touch menus and going through the same sequences again and again.Overall, a decidedly unexciting laptop, but one that is very serviceable, about what one would expect in this price range.  I did review an ACER Aspire V5 a few months ago.

The battery life seems better than advertised.

Installation and personalization were incredibly easy to accomplish.  I was expecting trouble because of the new operating system (Windows 8.1) and my own lack of experience with this hardware manufacturer.

I had trouble connecting the printer to my big Windows 7 desktop and decided to try a new and up to date system to dedicate to this process.  This computer turned out to be an excellent choice.

This 3 lb small laptop has a key board that is comfortable to type on and it is a fully-functional, super-portable laptop.  I use it mainly for school and for my needs has been so much more convenient to use than an iPad.  I know it's a completely different product, but if you're looking for portability, note-taking, reading power points, writing papers, doing things online, this is really a fantastic little computer.  It's a great price and super fast.  It also has a normal HDMI so I can also connect it to my larger monitor when I'm home.
