Kept it for three weeks and installed many configurations of OSes (XP, Windows 7, many Linux distros) on it which all ran well.Pros:Excellent keyboard and touchpad - just liked the feel of both.Nice metallic finish - it showed some prints and smudges but not bad at all.Fast i5 processorQuiet and coolGood fit and finish - felt solidGood priceCons:Not really a con but I could not get used to having the touchpad offset to the left because of the numeric keypad. This seems to be a standard configuration in today's 15\" portables so I am shopping for a 14\" now.Windows 8 - well, enough has been said about Windows 8 I guess. Easily replaced with alternative OSes but you are *paying* for it after all which may be galling.Average battery life.Summary:Impressive portable, hence the 4 stars. Lenovo has mysteriously sold out of the G480 14\" equivalent and is not making a 14\" in their new G-series portables (WTF?).", "Date": "September 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Laptop for the price but...", "Author": "Rohit Shambhuni", "ReviewID": "R1QVPPXCZRFHF1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I ordered this laptop when it was like $459 and now it has gone up by a whopping $120!! Thanks to Amazon Prime shipping I got my Laptop in 2 days. Okay, here are the pros and cons....PROS:- Amazing sound!!! The first movie I played on it was The Dark Knight Rises and thanks to Hans Zimmer and Dolby Advanced Audio, I could feel goosebumps again. ;)- I like the looks.- Doesn't get hot even after using it for a long time.- Keyboard is pretty good although they could have made the \"Enter\" key a bit bigger.- One key Recovery is awesome.CONS:- PLASTIC!! The plastic on the laptop is very cheap and whenever I put laptop on my lap, the plastic near the cooling fan, which is very feeble, touches the fan and starts making a sound that'll annoy you. VERY BAD!- There is some problem with the Wireless Adapter Driver software they are shipping with Windows 8 as my laptop would continuously crash showing a Blue Screen Error : BAD_POOL_HEADER. I figured that it was the problem with Wireless Adapter software as it was not compatible with Windows 8. So I installed Windows 7 ( I personally don't like Windows 8) on my laptop and everything has been great since then.So, I would have said BUY THIS LAPTOP, when it was $459 but considering the current price, $579, I would say consider other options before finalizing on this laptop.", "Date": "September 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Shipped at speed-light", "Author": "silvermind,", "ReviewID": "R22MYAIGKGXD0K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good price.

I purchased this as a gift for someone and must say its good over all. I hated win8 from the get go.. and thought it would be a better idea to load it with win7 prior to gifting. Not the Mfg issue, but windows8 is a pain. I am not docking a star for the OS. The start is getting docked due to the trackpad. I have a lenovo t410 and enjoy its track pad. I think they went a little too cheap with the sensitivity/feel/responsiveness on the G8580's track pad. Just wasn't the quality you would expect with the lenovo brand... and yes I know I am comparing a different line of Lenovo, but the track pad is a key area of focus when it comes to laptops.", "Date": "August 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "So Good", "Author": "Mohammed M.", "ReviewID": "R207KJNFU170JI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the thing that i wanted.This is a very good laptop from all side.I love it.Lenovo is the 2nd laptop company from ranking.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Happy about it.", "Author": "Romesh Upadhyay", "ReviewID": "R1ITZ1Y4O7DLFR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Got this new laptop for mostly web surfing and personal use.

It's super quite and it's not too big to sit on your lap. The only reason why I give it 4 stars is because I don't like Windows 8 .. That takes a while to get use to, and I still have issues with it after months later. The battery life does seem a bit short but it charges up fast. I love how fast it is, it boots fast and loads Internet Explorer fast. I also use a double browser at times, Explorer and Firefox to play some of my games. It's so fast and it has plenty of storage space for pictures and music.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great laptop.

Great screen, no lag, good speed, one think I'm very happy with its the keyboard excellent. I don't understand why so many bad reviews for Windows 8, it's a change but you just have to adapt. And when you get how to use it it's fine. No need of so many bad reviews. I'm thinking in buy a 4gb more of ram for the laptop, not because it need more memory just because I think that I will increase the life of the laptop.", "Date": "August 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00ATANTR2"}}
