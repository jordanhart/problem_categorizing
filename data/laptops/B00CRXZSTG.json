{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Overall seems to be excellent value, but a BIG BUT...", "Author": "Michael Yoo", "ReviewID": "RGDHWJT6W26X1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the price, it has everything you'd expect and functions well, including the touchscreen which was something of a pre-purchase concern for me. Small issue was that it shipped with a noticable gap between the top of the screen and the \"lid\" of the laptop that's annoying (seems like the plastic clips used to attach the screen's bezel to the \"lid\" are weak, and there's no adhesive).Here's the BIG BUT....The freaking trackpad is super sensitive and placed (and designed) in such a way as to constantly be touched during typing on the physical keyboard. The way I place my palms means the base of my thumbs is regularly contacting the trackpad and makes typing quite an ordeal. Literally I've had my cursor skip three times now just writing this review. My annoyance level with this during my first week of ownership is quickly moving towards \"problem which makes me wish I bought another laptop\" territory. I've never had this problem with a laptop before, and it seems the issue is that there the trackpad is quite large in area compared to other laptops I've owned, and also its barely recessed in from the area surrounding it. Also, there's no tactile difference between the trackpad and the surrounding area of the laptop so its impossible to tell by feel when the pad of your thumb is touching the trackpad.In conclusion, this one issue makes the overall functionality of this laptop pretty poor, and is forcing me to be conscious of my hand placement in a way I've never had to deal with or think about before. It makes quick typing in a \"non-desk\" situation i.e. when I'm in my comfy chair with the laptop in my lap, really, really annoying. Small design flaw that affects user, well, any time you're using physical keyboard. This is my third Lenovo, and while I'm still a fan of the brand I wish I hadn't gotten this particular model due to this issue. Gah, now fourth time.", "Date": "September 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a good laptop", "Author": "Charlene Arnold", "ReviewID": "R2RQ95E79AYRWH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop to use for school, as I am taking all online courses and would be needing something that would be durable and run fast.  After extensive research into a multitude of different brands and models, this is the computer that I and my brother (who is a computer tech) found to be the best computer to fit my needs for the price.I really like this laptop, the touch screen is very nice, it's not too touchy and is definitely very beneficial to have with the new Windows 8 system.The system runs smoothly, all of the windows open quickly.  No matter where I am at the computer picks up the wifi signal almost instantly.I DISLIKE that if I have the mouse sitting over something for a short period of time or if I'm slowly moving it, it has a tendency to select things on it own, so I guess it's a little touch.  I LOVE though that the mouse pad has so many options on it, I have the ability to use 2 fingers to slide up and down on the screen, 2 fingers to zoom in or out, 2 fingers to rotate around and I have the option to turn it off if I desire not to use it anymore.The battery life is okay, I definitely wouldn't leave the house without bringing the charger with me if I planned to use it for any prolonged amount of time.The speakers are not the greatest, this isn't really a big issue to me because I don't really use my computer for movies, music or extensive gaming,  They aren't crackly or anything like they, the speakers just aren't very loud and I'm sure it's due to the fact that the speakers seem to be under the computer.I love that it has a SD card slot, I use it all the time and it's a life saver, aswell as multiple USB ports.  The CD ROM drive works well, but it does have a short delay while it loads, just as a heads up.In my opinion this is a great computer for the money, it's exceeded my expectations greatly.", "Date": "March 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "Unhappy with sound quality and speaker", "Author": "Fiona", "ReviewID": "RL2R7ACA574NI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Really really unhappy with how poorly the speaker on this computer works.

The start up and shut down is really fast. The touch screen is great with Edge to edge glass screen that's easy to use with touch feature.. The screen is sharp and crisp but wish the resolution was little higher for a 15 inch laptop. The laptop is super quiet and don't have any heating problem in normal use. The palm rest is very comfortable for long use. Sound is not spectacular but more than adequate for everyday use. Even the refurbished model comes with full 1 year warranty.
