{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Cool concept, poor design.", "Author": "Andrew Heaston", "ReviewID": "R12HIXS9ZFDYYG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Purchased this laptop as a manufacturer refurb from woot. Included a 3mo warranty.The good:Versatile. Tablet / laptop functions are both excellent. Does 2 jobs with 1 machine.Nice, sturdy feel.Keyboard feels nice, with some substance.Screen is bright, full range of colors, and with a wide viewing angle.Runs very quick, SSD does wonders for it.Touch works very well.The bad:Touch pad has a hard time right-clicking.Video cable shoulders wear and tear of the cool dual function laptop-tablet. There is a flat flex cable (search FFC cable) bridging the gap between screen and body of the laptop. Every slide and bend of the laptop requires the cable the fold, stretch, and bend with it. This wear and tear accumulates fast, and after only 3.5 months of use I've experienced intermittent loss of video or 2 inch swaths of missing video / lines. Being that warranty was 3mo, I am left with the choice to try to tackle it myself or send it in and pay for Toshiba to fix it.The company - Poor customer service. All reps I spoke with were based out of the SE pacific and communication skills were lacking. Made multiple attempts at utilizing warranty to resolve issues, only to be transferred 5-7 times and told that they could not fix the problem. Chat / email options non-existent, and transferring to someone who can effectively communicate with me was impossible.Would not purchase again. Will likely avoid toshiba all together.", "Date": "June 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice notebook", "Author": "Jah \"brannew\"", "ReviewID": "R3KRBQ9GHP2URS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a nice speedy notebook with excellent build quality.
