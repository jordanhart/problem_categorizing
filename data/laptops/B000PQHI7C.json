Betamacs is an awesome company in my opinion, because they exceeded their advertised product quality.  not only was the computer new looking, but it was also preloaded with many different programs i would've downloaded later, such as open office, firefox, etc.  They also gave me a good 20 extra GB of hard drive capacity.  I will be writing my second novel on this computer, it's really all I needed and I think the processor runs better than intel.

Pros: great operating system, ( osx leopard 10.5.8). No set up required or installations necessary.ok software preinstalled. used, but came in pretty good condition, with only surface scratches. came with everything the seller described plus extras (laptop carrying bag).Cons: ibook g4 gets really hot on the bottom. unable to udpate to lastest programs, such as adobe flash, google chrome etc. the ibook g4 (os x 10.5 leopard) is a power pc so most web program updates are not compatable with this system (adobe,browsers etc). the updates are for intel pc's which this is not, so thats why you cant install program updates. only browser compatable is safari 5.0, firefox 3.6, camino and a few others (old versions). On youtube the flash loads up slow and lags with this g4 ppc, but its manageable. 4 stars for good condition of ibook g4. 5 stars for the OS. 1 star for the processor speed. 4 stars for the seller of this notebook. overall 3.5 stars.

About a week ago (i first received this ibook on 3/4/11), while surfing the web the computer screen will make a screeching sound and then freeze up. I also get the error message to restart the computer. I do, and it'll freeze up again...and again and again. Some times, it doesn't even make it to the desktop and it'll freeze up on me.

I'd been shopping for a refurbished laptop for a while, not wanting to spend the money for a new laptop for a 16-year old at this time.  The G4 got great reviews and, since my wife owns a newer MacBook that my son borrowed constantly, I thought the iBook would ease the competition in our home for computer resources.  This particular model has lived up to its reviews extremely well--it's a functional, solidly made appliance that has all the capabilities needed, including Bluetooth connectivity and a connection to our home wireless network via AirPort.  It's certainly not as flashy as the newer, forged-from-a-single-block-of-aluminum model, but it fills the bill splendidly.  This iBook looks to be a real workhorse and the price can't be beat.

Apple products may be expensive but they last forever. I have never had problems with this computer. Its battery life is actually about 2 hours longer than my dell laptop I bought last year. Most of laptops more than 5 years old have a battery life of about 5 seconds. Thats pretty impressive. Of course this laptop has inferior specs compared to computers today, but you can still do basic things like browse the internet, write papers, synthesize music (yes it comes with garageband), photoshop, some games, etc.Its operating system is immune to all windows viruses. There is hardly any malware out there for mac os x. So you're computer won't slow down overtime from browsing the web like windows will. People say there are no programs for macs, but since the popularity of macs has risen over the years this is no longer true. I have all the basic programs I have on my windows computer like Microsoft Word, VLC, Firefox, MSN messenger, etc. Just a note, the highest operating system you can have for this computer is Mac os x leopard as it doesn't not have an intel processor.I'd recommend this computer if you want save money.
