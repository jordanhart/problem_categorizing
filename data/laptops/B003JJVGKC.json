I liked HP products and found this gem. It had everything I was looking for at a reasonable price. The screen display is unbelievable! I LOVE my screen. Powerful, great processor, lots of storage and user friendly processes. The only drawbacks for me were the shorter than average battery life and, since I wanted a decent-sized screen,it is a little big for carrying around. It is going to be missed if I have to replace it anytime soon. Had this one for almost 3 years!", "Date": "July 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "cool", "Author": "Amazon Guru", "ReviewID": "RDV04WU765Y0F", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a very cool laptop that can be updated to Windows 8It has a 2.10 ghz processor which moves at an exceptional speed and the excellency doesn't end there camera is", "Date": "September 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Now I know why it was so cheap", "Author": "REDHERRING", "ReviewID": "R2WB9B2P9B957T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought this piece of garbage 3 years ago, Black Friday sale. The fan had to be replaced due to overheating within 4 months. Not even a year later, same problem plus the battery was shot (not that it was any good anyway. 45 min battery life was the most I ever got from it unplugged.) I will admit, initially, I would leave the computer on the carpet a lot but never did it again once the fan was replaced the first time. This laptop is a fossil by today's standards anyways but if anyone happens to come across this....buyer beware!", "Date": "April 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Worst computer ever", "Author": "roynoris15 \"pool float angel\"", "ReviewID": "R3BMTO86HG8MOJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This computer cause me problems like screen flicking in hd on youtube.Try booting windows xp will fail plus IT'S A SINGLE CORE COMPUTER DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B003JJVGKC"}}
