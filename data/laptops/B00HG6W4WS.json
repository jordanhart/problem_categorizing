general impressions of this laptop's  functionality and features.  While it may not satisfy every PC user's needs, it's a good laptop that has much to offer despite having an Achilles Heel in its lack of a designated graphics card.WHAT KIND OF PC USER AM I?I am an advanced user, having built a few desktops and owned over 20 PCs in the last 16 years. My experience with Windows PC's has been with operating systems from  XP onward. My favorite Windows operating system has been Windows 7, however with a touchscreen I now see the benefits of Windows 8 and 8.1, and am working to learn more about it.I like to stream music and video, edit photos and video, play some web based games, prowl  the Internet and complete my work via office applications on my PCs.My needs from a PC are fairly simple.  I want it to work quickly, not bog down and if it has features or programs that require upgrades to hardware, I expect the installed hardware to support it.WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH THIS LAPTOP?This touchscreen Sony Vaio from the `Fit' line (thin at only 1.07\" and about 6 pounds)  is good for everyday use and general entertainment.  It's good  for students, home and business users.It works well for productivity applications, online gaming, listening to music, streaming movies and watching DVDs.  It can also be used to edit video and photos, but despite having great software to do this, it can freeze up when doing graphic-intensive tasks.The laptop  has some really nice features.  NFC (Near Field Communication), use as an access point,  responsive full HD 1920 x 1080P 15.5\" touchscreen, and use as a charging station, even when the laptop is powered off.This Sony Vaio is a good laptop, with a beautiful HD display and webcam, but it was a disappointment to find out the integrated graphics are NOT upgradable (per Sony online chat)  via a designated graphics card upgrade.LOW WINDOWS PERFORMANCE INDEXThe Windows Performance Index for this PC is only 4.8 due to low performing graphics.This is not PC for `gamers' who require PCs with designated graphic memory for smooth running games,, nor will it satisfy those who use other high powered software related to 3D rendering and video editing.The full HD screen at 1080P is beautiful, but the lack of a Blu-ray player was a disappointment. Per Sony, this can be upgraded however, but again, not the graphics card so performance with that upgrade might suffer.CONCLUSIONOverall, I like this PC, and Windows 8.1 works very well with the touchscreen.  It has lots of wonderful features, but stopped just short of being great by not upgrading the optical drive to a Blu-ray and giving the system a solid stability boost with a designated graphics card.Not being able to upgrade the graphics on this laptop, nor fully utilize the full HD screen with Blu-ray was disappointing.  It makes me vacilate between a 3 and 4 star rating, bumping up to the 4 star because I do like the included software perks and other than the graphics performance, this laptop does perform.PROS+ Processing speed and memory combine for quick response.+ Gorgeous Full-HD 1080P display.+ Backlit keyboard+ USB 3.0 (2) ports+ USB 2.0 (2) ports that can be used as charging ports, even when laptop is off.+ NFC (Near Field Communication)+ Can act as an access point for other devices.+ HDMI port+ Full-sized keyboard with 10-Key, feels good to type on.+ Touchscreen is responsive, and works well with Windows 8.1+ HD webcam - works well in low light conditions.+ Good port placement towards the front of the laptop, for easy user access.+ Media card reader+ Excellent microphone+ Stays very cool with use and virtually no fan noise.+ Solid build quality+ Very thin, despite having an optical DVD/CD drive installed.+ Nice software package: Sony Entertainment (for music creation and DVD movie production), 30-days Kaspersky Antivirus, ArtRage Studio, and Adobe Photoshop Elements 12.+ Rapid Wake feature works very well; no need to power down the PC.CONS-Integrated graphics provides fair to poor performance in some programs.- No way to upgrade the graphics with a designated graphics card.-Windows Performance Index score is 4.8 out of 10.0-No Blu-ray player, despite having a full HD display. *(Can upgrade optical drive if desired.)- AC power connection to the laptop is somewhat hard to connect, with cable to power brick being lightweight and lesser quality than desired.**Be sure to read the Amazon Product Description for features, and the Technical Specs for hardware info on this laptop.**SONY SUPPORTI contacted Sony Support to ask about the ability to upgrade this laptop with a designated graphics card, and they were quick to respond to my contact request via online chat.Sony's online Support area has lots of helpful information about this laptop, in addition to online tutorials about Windows 8 and 8.1, which include videos.The Sony Support area has a `Community' area where customers can ask questions and share information.  I found it to be an area rich in information and likely to be very helpful of users of the Sony Vaio series of laptops.NOTE RE VIDEO:  EXTRA SOFTWARE NOT INCLUDEDCamtasia and Corel PaintShop Pro X6 software are NOT included with this laptop, nor are the free programs -  Classic Shell, CCleaner, OpenOffice or Malwarebytes Free.  **These are programs I added to the laptop prior to the review, as well as several free apps from the Microsoft AppStore.UPDATE: 3/11/14 - Sony Music StudioI hooked up my Audio Technica AT-LP60 Fully Automatic Belt Driven Turntable to this laptop via the microphone jack using a Hometheatre 3.5mm Male to 2 RCA Female Splitter Cable (6-Inch).  Using Sony's Sound Forge Audio Studio 10.0 (part of the great software package on this laptop), I was able to record analog audio (LPs) and digitize it to WAV or MP3 files (I chose MP3 CD quality with enhancements).I thought I would need a pre-amp adapter (costing thirty to fifty bucks...), but much to my delight the combination of the sound card and software work perfectly together for this job.  Cassettes will also work with a player and RCA cable.UPDATE: 4/23/14I use this laptop with my HDTV and a Google Chromecast HDMI Streaming Media Player device to stream videos from the internet onto my TV. I have been a 'cord cutter' (no cable TV) for a year and this is one of the ways I get supplemental programming. If you want to check out my book: Simple Guide to Over-the-Air Free TV, it might give you some ideas how to do this sort of thing too.UPDATE: 5/21/14I'm really enjoying using this laptop as my home theater media PC. I installed XBMC software and am now streaming content via HDMI cable to my HDTV, which works perfectly! I picked up a Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad which makes navigation that much easier (I can leave the laptop across the room and navigate from the couch). TIP: If you want HD resolution on your HDTV, make sure the laptop screen resolution settings are set to 1920 x 1080.", "Date": "March 4, 2014"}, {"Title": "Long battery life, cool touchscreen and good functionality (but keep in mind that it's heavy)", "Author": "Z. Freeman \"Zach\"", "ReviewID": "R3R0RILLAS2NN8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been using a Macbook Air for the last several years so the weight of this laptop took a little getting used to. Keep that in mind if you're moving from a smaller laptop: this guy weighs 7.4 pounds. That being said, you get a lot of functionality with that weight, not least of all being the bigger screen size (15.5 inch) and higher quality resolution (watching movies/videos in HD was a revelation to me after streaming movies in normal resolution - this processor and screen are a big improvement).The laptop comes with Windows 8 already installed and that's either a bonus or a liability depending on your feelings about Windows 8. I wasn't crazy about it initially but now that I've got the hang of it I enjoy it.But the biggest draw here is the touchscreen capability that is mixed in with the normal keyboard usage. To go from app to app you just swipe the left side of your screen and it transfers you - this is a huge timesaver and makes getting from program to program a lot quicker and easier. The only problem I have here is that if you accidentally click in the wrong place on the mousepad you'll suddenly find your screen changing apps seemingly for no reason. This can be a bit frustrating but I have come to understand when and why this happens and generally can avoid it now. Still, it's something to look out for - if the mousepad had click buttons underneath it this might alleviate this problem as you don't always think about right-click vs. left-click when you're using the mousepad to scroll with.Having access to the app store and being able to install games and run them on a giant touch screen is cool and makes this more than just your average laptop.In terms of battery life, the battery seems to last a loooooong time but it also takes forever to charge. This is no problem if you consider the general method of using a laptop is to plug it in at home and then be able to use it while you're out and about - you'll get a lot of life out of this guy before you have to charge it again.Overall, my initial reaction to this laptop was a little negative but after using it for a few weeks (and installing software that I use for work like Visual Studio and SQL Server) I'm impressed with it and enjoy using it.", "Date": "March 13, 2014"}, {"Title": "very happy", "Author": "Lucienne Marotte", "ReviewID": "R1YZ5AN4OTHUDM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly what I wanted.  Computer has been working well so far.  This is to replace another Vaio Computer (3 yrs old)", "Date": "April 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great specs, disappointing usability", "Author": "niek", "ReviewID": "R2S2PDVXMI70P0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Nowadays almost every CPU on the market has plenty of power, memory is fast, disks are fast, and nice touch screens are plenty. All the more critical is the task of integrating all of the components into a usable machine. Here it is that Sony falls short. If you take all these high quality components, but put them together in an unrefined case with poorly designed and built input devices, the end result is disappointing. The issues I'm having with this notebook all come down to usability. I'll break it down by build issues and design issues.Build issues:Top row of back-lit keys lighting is misaligned with keys. Those are bright white LED's intended to be hidden beneath the keys. On my unit the lights shine right underneath, which irritates the eyes. There is no brightness setting available. However, it is possible to have the lights come on only when keys are pressed. Still, it was irritating on the eyes which is unfortunate when a back-lighted keyboard is one of the reasons for purchase.Space bar is a flimsy piece of plastic which flexes easily. This caused frequent missed keystrokes in typing. This would be unacceptable in any notebook regardless the price.The clickpad rattles when tapped, and the surface is slightly askew. Also very erratic in response to touch, but a driver update improved the erratic behavior.The plastic body in general comes across as unrefined and when lifted at the corners, it flexes more than would be expected in a notebook of this class.Design issues:Half size arrow keys, while earlier models had full size and better placement. There's plenty of room for full size arrow keys.Activity (power, HDD, battery) indicator lights on front edge are out of sight. One must lift the notebook to see those, again unlike earlier models.Lack of 'fn' keys and indicator lights, e.g. no keys for Wi-fi on/off, keyboard backlight on/off, Bluetooth on/off, no Wi-fi indicator light;Placement of all USB connectors at sides near front is unpractical as devices/cords get in the way. Missing is at least one USB connector at the rear near power connector.The included (US) charger with two prong cord cannot be used with European power cords, requires purchase of additional 3 prong charger for Europe. Most other notebooks I purchased came with 3 prong chargers.The FHD touch screen has nice colors, touch works fine, but the viewing angle is narrow and the screen suffers from color distortions when not viewing from a 90 degree angle.The Exmor web cam produces a grainy, discolored picture when ambient light is less then full daylight.The hard disk head is parking anytime the laptop is moved/tilted in upward/downward position, making a clicking noise. This happens frequently when holding the notebook in a tilted position, even when movement is very slow (this is a feature meant to protect the disk in case of a fall, but it seems way too sensitive).Battery capacity of 2670 Mah is undersized for this notebook.All the usability issues together make a poor user experience with this notebook, despite good sound, good display colors and good CPU/memory/disk performance. It is just badly designed and built. From what I've seen older models at least were better designed. This could have been a great notebook if design and build quality had been up to par.", "Date": "March 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "i love the laptop because i was a previous owner of a sony but.....", "Author": "Nikia Boykin", "ReviewID": "R3UQNOHC1XRV8F", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This the second laptop that I have purchased from Amazon that came with a DVD-RW that does not work....otherwise I would have given 5 stars....Now I have to do all the leg work to have something fix that was suppose to be brand new!", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Looks nice, but what's up with having to constantly reconnect to the internet?", "Author": "Brooke Ertel", "ReviewID": "R3NWAD4P5ITYAG", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm not sure if it's a windows 8 problem or what, but every five minutes you have to reconnect to the internet.

Won't get into my experiences with Apple other than I have to use a non-Mac product for my coursework given the ND University System (NDUS) does not like to support Safari and I REALLY don't feel like downloading Firefox or anything else on my MacBook and jeopardize my film projects.However, having tried the Vaio for over a month and even conducting extensive tests with it by loaning it to my little brother, a student at the local community college who has a propensity for destroying stuff via frustration, I found that the Vaio is much more versatile for your everyday college student than originally imagined.  While it's no Mac, it's a great substitute for those not wanting to fork out four figures for an Apple product placement in their man purse.

The system specs are adequate for anyone running basic college programs and MS Office and even a few non-highend games.For accessing online college content, particularly Campus Connection, the Vaio seems a little overqualified but the touchscreen interface allows for easy navigation and interface making the experience seem a lot more streamlined.  However, there were a few instances where the touchscreen seemed to be stuck in place as if I'm still pushing the screen where I just did even though my fingers are nowhere near it.  It could be that myself or my master of disaster brother pressed the screen too hard and it forced the sensor in place.  While this is more of a fault on our behalf, it does illustrate the seeming fragility of touch screens.  However, this just means you have to be careful and not pierce, puncture, or otherwise pulverize the screen with your fingers.Also, the laptop itself does not feel as sturdy as other laptops I've used, particularly my MacBook Pro and the Panasonic Toughbooks I've used for work but this system is more designed for performance than rugged.  All in all, still a great gift for those high school graduates that'll use it more for gaming and the storage of adult-oriented videos than actually studying.", "Date": "April 16, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HG6W4WS"}}
