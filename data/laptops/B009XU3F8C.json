The fact that it's got upgradable components is fantastic.  I immediately upgraded my 4gigs of ram to 10 gigs.  it's fast and has an operating battery life of around 5 hrs based on my usage.  Standby battery is WAY long.  I haven't charged it in almost 3 weeks.The only complaint I would have is that it feels like they went a little too thin on the frame.  Unlike the apple air, if you pinch the edges, you can tell that the bottom and top don't mate perfectly and there's tiny gaps.  So why didn't I go with the Apple Air?  it's not upgradable.  The Macbook pro would have been my choice had I known that it was more ruggedly built and could dual boot windows (I run a lot of windows based software so that helped make my decision also).Overall though, probably one of the best PC options out there when it comes to upgradable ultrabooks.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "Maria-Angela Meireles", "ReviewID": "R3TT8RXSJN21SX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was looking for this computer configuration for a long time!
