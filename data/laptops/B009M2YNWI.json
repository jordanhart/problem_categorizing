{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Perfect at what it's supposed to do and be", "Author": "Stephen", "ReviewID": "R37G9Y9Q20XXLA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This computer is not meant to be a desktop replacement. It is not for everyone, either, as Google's ad states. However, it is a computer that can be utilized by many people. I'll talk about the following aspects of the computer in this review: 1. Keyboard 2. Trackpad 3. Screen 4. Performance 5. What can people use it for in general? 6. Price, build quality and wrap-up1. The keyboard on this computer is absolutely marvelous. As you may have guessed, I'm using it to type this review. The keys are spaced very evenly, and there is a reassuring *click* that makes old mechanical keyboards look like dinosaurs. One minor detail many people will notice: there seems to be no Caps Lock here. It has been replaced by a search key. However, Google is quick to tell us that we can still access the key by pressing Alt-Search. Also, no number pad, but computers of this size can't really have them due to space constraints.2. I will always keep my mouse handy because I'm not much of a trackpad person. However, that's not to say that I'm going to do you readers a disservice and not review an important aspect of the Chromebook. This trackpad parallels the one on my dad's MacBook Air. In case that's not clear, it is the best trackpad you will get at this price point (more on that later). Suffice it to say that using it is a fluid experience that will leave all but the pickiest among us satisfied.3. This is a 1366 x 768 matte screen. What does this mean for consumers? Let's just say it's not the best screen out there. For that, one must look no further than an iPad 4 or a Nexus 10 (both are more expensive). Once again, it's a matte screen (for more on that, look up matte vs. glossy screens on Google, Yahoo, or Bing). No dead pixels so far, videos are fine, but remember that this is a relatively small screen, so it may well be hard on your eyes. I myself am 18 years old and have decent vision, but some who will consider this should be aware that it is imperative to try to go to a local Best Buy and use it for several minutes. Rest assured, however, that the display on this computer is great for what it's supposed to be.4. This may well be the most important section for some of us, myself included. This computer has what's called an ARM processor. It is one of the most powerful ARM processors currently available for consumers. These processors mean no fans, no noise, but possibly worsened performance. Let's look at all three of those points: it is true that there are no fans or hard drives or other moving parts of any kind in this device, and it really doesn't make any noise. As for actual performance, with just 2 GB of RAM advertised, and probably less actually available for the user, try not to open more than roughly eight to ten tabs at once. I'll be more specific: if YouTube is running, music will be choppy almost all the time if anything, and I mean anything, is loading. If Google can fix this through one of their every-six-weeks software updates, then great, but if not, know that this is what you get at such a low price point. Oh, and by the way, as for games, your mileage may vary. What I mean is that you can go ahead and try to play your favorite browser-based games, but some games will run slowly, while others will run smoothly. If you wanna play chess on the Chromebook, be my guest; I doubt it'll lag.5. Also an important section, obviously. Chromebooks are not for everyone, as I noted before. Let's review what you can and can't do here first: you CAN create documents, slideshows, spreadsheets, and even forms that can be posted online for others to fill out (awesome feature by the way, try Google Forms, even if you don't have a Chromebook). You CAN have a calendar here with appointments and all that jazz (Google Calendar), and you CAN have reminders as well. You CAN do many things even when there is no Internet connection: documents, slideshows, spreadsheets, music, MOVIES (not YouTube videos), games that support offline play, among other things. I think it's adequate to say that Chromebooks have come a long way in terms of being able to use them offline. Moving along, you CAN'T play any games that are not in the browser (examples are World of Warcraft, Guild Wars 2, etc). You CAN'T use Skype, Facetime, Photoshop, or any program that has no browser mode. Off the top of my head, some more prominent examples of this include writing code for computer programs, but if that's what you do, then you probably already knew that.6. It only costs $249 plus applicable taxes. I think that this is great. Half the price of the iPad but it can do everything that the iPad can, and it has a larger screen and a keyboard to boot (it is a laptop, after all). Also, let's not forget that this device looks almost like a MacBook Air. It's thin, light, and sleek (boy, are those words overused). It looks great in my eyes. Sure, the iPad has a much, much, sharper screen, but it's more expensive. This is the perfect workhorse/plaything/do-it-all-except-non-browser-stuff device. I'd say buy it, but before you do, do what I did: try to justify it to yourself. Don't say, \"Do I want/need this device?\" Instead, say, \"Will I use this device for enough things to justify buying it?\" The price point is low enough that many of you could do no wrong in buying the Chromebook, so go out and get one if it'll be useful to you.", "Date": "November 8, 2012"}, {"Title": "Fantastic product at a great price!", "Author": "Aravind Reddy", "ReviewID": "R2YSDHZ7CIPNJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got the new Chromebook from a nearby Bestbuy store and my first impressions are that this is an amazing value for 250 dollars. The build quality is well constructed, although it does not have the premium feeling a laptop like the Macbook Air. However, there is no flex to the machine and the keyboard/trackpad are top notch. The display does not have wide viewing angles, although this shouldn't be too much of a problem unless if it is just you using the laptop. The battery life so far has been impressive since with about four hours of use, it has gone done about 56 %. i will update this review after a couple more weeks of using it as my primary laptop. One concern I do have is the charger is not as durable as I would like and I am not sure how it will fair in long term use, but I will update this review if I experience any problems with it. As far as Chrome OS, I have used both the Mac operating system as well as Windows and I am quite pleased with the experiences I have had on my chromebook so far. Google docs, which comes preloaded on the Chromebook, is a fantastic substitute for Microsoft Word and it works well even if the computer is offline. Adobe flash is already installed on the computer and the performance is quite good for video watching and flash websites such as Amazon Instant Video. I would suggest downloading the application Adblock from the Chrome Web store because it will stop any flash ads from popping up, which I have generally found to decrease the performance of loading a website. Unless you are heavy gamer or do a lot of video/photo editing, I would highly recommend this product.", "Date": "October 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Light, small, easy to use - a tablet with a keyboard!", "Author": "Sam", "ReviewID": "R3R3QBCAI2NJEM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "When my old laptop conked off, I needed a laptop to use around the house. I also recently started commuting by train to work so wanted to buy a small, light laptop that I could take with me and check email or facebook or read the news, surf the web etc. on the train. I also wanted a real keyboard for the occasional work-related email, so the iPad was out. When this Chromebook got announced I was pretty excited since it really fit all my criteria - light, quick to boot and so on. I received it a couple of hours back and I have to admit its really nice.I went from box to being fully setup (including my bookmarks and extensions) within a few minutes. This Chromebooks also comes with a lots of apps pre-loaded and I also got an offer for 100GBs of storage on Google Drive. Gmail and YouTube are also installed on the desktop so the sites I use the most are right there. Overall this machine feels quite fast. The interface is also quite clean and pretty especially the background images that come with the device.I like how light the laptop feels and that it can easily fit into a small laptop bag that I take on my commute. I could potentially leave the power cord at home as well since it's supposed to last for several hours without needing a recharge - so even less stuff to carry. It's easy to take from room to room within the house as well. The other thing I noticed is how quiet this is - specially compared to my work desktop or my work laptop which I can hear from another room! This laptop feels very different from all the laptops I have used in the past - its almost like an iPad but with a keyboard so its more useful. I am amazed at the price - this feels a lot more expensive.Overall based on the last couple of hours of usage I am happy that I bought it. This is exactly what I wanted.", "Date": "October 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Ancillary for Laptop Users", "Author": "Alexander T. Baird \"Alex Baird\"", "ReviewID": "RR0O7RVX3GV0J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung chromebook is a solid accessory for laptop users who want a lightweight alternative that provides more functionality than most tablets and smartphones.  The only thing to keep in mind is that this is a connected product that depends on a connection to the Google online services to be useful.I purchased this unit and the Acer Chromebook to assess its use as a supplementary computer for consultants traveling with our company.  My criteria for a good alternative would be based on:-Ability to access and use web applications used by our consultants-Ease of use for a non-technical user-Portability-Reliability-DurabilityChrome OS:  The chrome OS, the interface and the operation of the software on both the Samsung and the Acer are identical.  Setup of the software takes about 5 minutes if you don't have a google account and about 2 minutes if you do.  Be aware that all new Google Accounts are automatically also signed up for Google+.  While I like Google+ some may not want to join yet another social network.  Unfortunately I don't see a way to opt out of that registration at the present time.Since the Chrome OS relies so heavily on the Google internet presence for almost all functionality, Google gives you a 2 year, 100 gb account on Google Drive to use with your Chrome OS (and your other computers).  It is on the G Drive that you will store all the files that you will use with the Chrome OS.  There is a limited 16gb of local storage on the device, but it is sometimes tough to see the distinction between the online/local file locations.  Best to store most files online.Booting the Chrome OS from a complete power off state takes a very quick 7-10 seconds on both the Acer and the Samsung.  ChromeOS logon is with your Google account credentials.  From credential logon to the desktop is less than a second.  If you use the Chrome browser on your laptop or desktop PC and have it sync'd with your Google account, you will bring all the \"apps\", bookmarks, extensions and history to the ChromeOS.  Setup of the desktop is straightforward and shouldn't confuse too many modern OS users.  Communications setup is also easy for wifi.  Bluetooth is available on the Samsung but requires delving into the \"settings\" options.  Applications, the Chrome Browser and other functions are arranged on the bottom left of the screen and pull up using the touchpad.  If you have used the Chrome Browser, GMail or other Google Apps, then you will be right at home on the OS.  I won't spend much time on the Google apps as this is a hardware review, but they work relatively well.  Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Gmail, Calendar and GDrive can all read and write standard office formats.  In my experience they can adequately replace MS office for on the go work and editing.  More complex editing and design is still best left to the more robust office tools.The Chrome OS is put into sleep if you close the screen and wakes to your last desktop when opened.  However, it does not appear that a relogon is forced after wake, leaving all of your data from the previous session up with your credentials. The Acer will sleep for approximately 24 hours while the Samsung can sleep a couple of days.Battery:  Battery life is much better on the Samsung with a full battery lasting about 7 hours under a good load.  The Acer battery is much weaker at 3 hours.  Samsung's battery is integrated into the laptop yielding a lighter weight and more refined look.  The acer battery is swappable but heavier.  Replacing the Samsung battery would require complete disassembly of the unit, much like the Macbook Airs or Iphones.Speed:  The Samsung is powered by 2gb of RAM and the exynos 1.7ghz processor (2 cores).  The acer uses an intel celeron 1.1ghz CPU with 2 gb of memory.  Memory is upgradeable in the Acer to 4 gig.  Samsung is not upgradeable.  The Samsung handled all loads I put on it, including heavy browser use, VUDU/Hulu/YouTube streaming HD and SD video.  Likewise the Acer was able to handle the same.  Page access and switching between tabs was quick as was access to email and Google Apps.  The Graphics process on the Acer is the Intel HD which should outperform the Samsungs integrated ARM Mali-T604.  However, since neither machine is really for designed for graphics intensive work (games, video/photo editing, etc..), the performance difference between the two is not noticeable.Storage:  The Samsung uses a very meager but fast 16gb of SSD storage, while the Acer uses a standard 320gb 5400rpm HD.  While the extra local storage is roomy, the Acer HD requires more power and cooling and this is noticeable in the shorter battery life.  The Acer also needs a fan to cool the HD and this can heat up the bottom of the laptop and further reduce battery life.  For an OS that requires the internet for use and storage, the larger Acer HD is superfluous.Screen:  The Samsung and Acer both use a 11.6\" screen.  Both screens are bright and viewable with auto adjusting (but defeatable) brightness.  The Samsung screen is slightly more viewable and bright.  The screen on the Samsung is angle constrained by its hinge with a full, flat recline not possible.  The Acers screen will lay flat if needed.Keyboard:  The Samsung and Acer both have unlit keyboards with a standard QWERTY layout.  No number pad on either.  The samsung keys are very responsive, well positioned and have a good feel.  The Acer keyboard is less responsive and has a very cheap feel to it.Touchpad:  Both the Samsung and Acer use touchpads for scrolling and clicking.  Right clicking is performed with a non-intuitive two finger touch/press.  The samsung touchpad is adequate and gives a decent feel of the desktop.  It does feel slightly sticky.  The Acer touchpad is less responsive and sometimes did not register movement.  A USB external mouse can be used on both.Ports: The Samsung gives you 2 USB ports, one 2.0 and one 3.0 highspeed.  The Acer has 3 USB 2.0 ports.  The Samsung gives a HDMI out while the Acer has VGA and HDMI.  Both can accept SD cards.  The Acer has an etherent port (10/100).  The Samsung is wifi only, no ethernet port.  Both Wifi are a/b/g/nPower: Both Chromebooks use powerbricks and grounded cables.  The Samsung has a smaller brick.  Samsung has the adapter port on the back while Acer has chosen a side port.  The rear location of the port for the Samsung is a drawback as it is sometimes a tighter fit when abutted to a wall or work area.Webcam: The Acer has a HD webcam (1280 X 720).  The Samsung has a VGA resolution webcam (640 X 480)Speakers: The Acer and Samsung have adequate speakers for personal listening.  Both have headphone ports.Durability and reliability:  Having only used both for about a month, I can't give a good feel for long term durability.  However having used both out in travel, I will say that the Samsung seems to be the better and more polished platform.  It has withstood some drops overnight in sub freezing temps without any issues. It has a much tighter build and seems to be better able to holdup log term.Weight and Size: The Acer is heavier (3.1 pounds) than the Samsung (2.4 pounds), thicker (Acer: 1.1 inch, Samsung: .7 inch) and less wide (Acer 11.2 inch, Samsung: 11.4 inch) and deep (Acer: 8inch, Samsung: 8.1 inch).  Overall the Samsung has a noticeably smaller footprint and weight, feeling more portable.Printing: Neither the Samsung or the Acer can directly connect to a printer.  Each has the option of using google's CloudPrint to access printers via the network.  Setting up cloudprint can be complex for non-technical users.  An alternative is to use Google Apps to either save documents to the GDrive and print from a full size computer, or save them as PDFs and access the printouts as files.Conclusion: For the additional $50 difference for my criteria I would recommend the Samsung Chromebook.  For the road warrior who wants a backup computing device that has a full keyboard the Samsung is a great choice.  It boots quickly, has a familiar interface and can do about 90% of what a full Windows/Mac laptop does at a fraction of the cost.  It is lightweight, has good battery life and works well as long as it has a internet connection.  I will be making a recommendation to get the Samsung Chromebooks for our consultants.", "Date": "January 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "What's it worth to leave Windows based OS behind?", "Author": "H. Pereira \"WhatEverItTakes\"", "ReviewID": "R1IA1CGEOYPBAQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not since the early 1990's have I considered using a different OS other than Windows.  But today is a new day and after many years of having my explorer freeze up or the constant update notification, I was ready for something else!  I've dabbed in Linux and apple but Linux felt unfinished and Macs are simply over priced for the extra benefit.  Here comes chrome OS at a price of $249 for a laptop that looks much more expensive and performs well.Here is the deal.  Chrome OS is not windows so do not expect it to work like windows or do what windows does.  Chrome is simply a web based OS that allows you to use Chrome store apps, which are essentially web apps.  Yes you can do this in windows and in fact you will be able to do everything this computer does in Windows, but windows has too much bloat.  You need more computer to run as smoothly in windows and again, the updates, the virus scans, malware, and so on is still prevalent in all windows.Most web apps are free which comes as a benefit of leaving windows behind.  Like android you will find that most webapps are free to use.  I'm not a person who can't afford to buy programs but why buy them when you can get them for free?  These web apps are cute, awesome, and some of them you would never have discovered if it wasn't for the chrome store, and that's the beautiful thing about chrome.  Chrome lets you venture out of the grip which is windows.. We are already locked in the business world to using windows, this allows you to at least personally free yourself from the Pc world.Why would you buy this over a tablet?  The tablet is an amazing device. I have a galaxy tab for myself and an ipad for my 2 year old daughter and without a doubt they are wonderful devices to consume information.  You can scroll through Pulse flawlessly, read the news easily, watch videos laying down in the comfort of your bed, and consume just about anything the web has in store for you.  The key word is CONSUME.  The tablet is great to consume but try writing something like this review, a blog post, create a spread sheet, edit a video, or you get the point.  This Chrome book and all Pc's in general are great to produce things and not just consume the web.  All in all you can produce things much easier on this device than other platforms in the same price point and with its lightweight design take it anywhere you need to take it.  After buying this laptop my galaxy tab sits by my nightstand as a reader because now I can produce and consume easily in this chromebook.Finally the cloud is the reason many say this chromebooks fails and the reason to purchase.  To use the cloud you have to be connected to the internet and this chromebook feels limp without the internet.  But wait a minute, I have tethering on my phone, wifi in my house, wifi at work, my business, and most places I eat also have free wifi.  The reality is I can have internet anywhere I want with my phone or super high speed just about anywhere else I find my self with free wifi all around us now days.  I would say that you really should have tethering on your phone to not feel constraint on this device.  When is the last time you were without your phone?  Now comes the best part of the cloud and chromebook.  Chrome OS almost forces you to use the cloud and this is not such a bad thing.  Too many times you will find you have double files, copies of thing here and there, and basically you get a new computer you lose some of that info, with the cloud all you will need is one copy and it will always be with you.  It's a permanent hard drive for all your devices.  No more emailing yourself spreadsheets or docs, you will simply turn on your computer and continue your work right where you left off.  No more losing those beautiful photos you took on your old phone, store them once in the cloud and those memories will be with you always.  Forcing you to use the cloud and get use to a new habit is not a bad thing once you see all the benefit and experience the ease of having one hard drive connecting all of your devices.  Thanks for reading and as a 20 year Windows user I'm excited about finding something that brings us back to the simplicity of productivity.", "Date": "November 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Excellent laptop for the price", "Author": "M G", "ReviewID": "R2GGG8TCD7Y2VK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had bought the Samsung 550 (and have reviewed that too). I've been very happy with the 550, but when this new version was released at only $249 I couldn't resist buying it (I'm married to a geek, so you can never have too many gadgets around the house).Here's what I love about this laptop - it's incredibly thin and light. However when you use it it feels big - the keyboard is a full-size one (the keyboard on the 550 is great too, but this is better) and the trackpad is huge too for a laptop this size. An improvement over the previous version is the trackpad surface - it's very smooth (almost feels like glass)which makes scrolling a breeze. Overall, the hardware is great and it looks really good (especially for the price tag)I was not expecting any surprises with the software since my old 550 has the latest features (thanks to automatic updates). However I was pleasantly surprised by the speed of the new 550 - it boots up quickly, pages load really fast too and all in all it's great to use. There are also a few new add-ons that are an improvement as well - apps that create a Google Doc, Slide or Spreadsheet with one click, as well as a new Camera app that's a lot of fun. I hope Google releases these for my old 550 too.All in all, I'm very happy with this laptop and highly recommend it - great features and usability for an amazing price.

Then this little guy showed up. I was sold when Engadget said it was 80% of the macbook air experience at a fraction of the price. I'd say it's more like 60% of the macbook air experience, but that's still an incredible deal for the price.Drawbacks:You can't print. You can set up google cloudprint but I haven't gotten it to work yet. You can't do anything that isn't inside a web browser. 95% of my computer usage is inside google chrome anyway, so that's not a huge deal for me as a second computer. You can't edit video or do anthing else that requires more than a simple file system and a web browser.Advantages:The keyboard and touchpad are near-mackbook quality. That makes them better than 70 percent of all laptops out there. Not a small thing. I love the two-finger scrolling which you can reverse so it works like a mac. Google calls it simple scrolling. There is two-finger right click too.The screen is fine. I wish I could put the bottom-of-the-screen launcher bar on the side of the screen to save precious vertical pixels.Interface is good. I set up separate user account for each of my kids. Not as smooth as a mac but smoother than windows 7.Build quality is better than your average laptop but not up to macbook standards. Considering the price it's amazingly well put together.Bottom line:  For someone like me who spends most of my computer time in chrome for mac, this is a natural second computer. It would be great for a student computer. If you want to edit videos or do other things that don't work very well in a web browser you should look elsewhere.You could easily spend three times this much and get a computer with a lesser keyboard, lesser touchpad, and inferior build quality.", "Date": "October 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "A beta test, not a consumer ready device", "Author": "Ian C. Muir", "ReviewID": "R5QPGOIW9YG2C", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I really wanted to like this laptop. We needed a second laptop for the family to use for checking email, surfing the web and watching the occasional video online. The Chromebook seemed like a good fit at first. It's inexpensive and the hardware, especially the keyboard, is quite good for the price. Unfortunately, the OS is really not ready yet and Google's support is lacking. Here's a quick list of the issues we've had:- On several occasions, we haven't been able to login, and cannot do anything with the laptop.- It will not play anything from Netflix. There is a message that says Netflix and Google are working together for a fix, but the message hasn't change for over a month and no updates have been made available.- It keeps resetting my settings and options, which is a problem since these changes carry over to my desktop. The advantage of Chrome OS is that things are shared between devices. The disadvantage is that means errors are also shared.- The AC adapter is VERY fragile. When we tried to buy a new one from Google, [...]says that it's \"not for sale at this time\". We have not yet found a place to buy a new adapter.When faced with problems like those above, support is non-existent. Going to support on the official Chromebook page brings you to a Google Group with over 10,000 unanswered questions. We attempted to call Google and were told we needed to call Samsung. When we called Samsung, they said we needed to call Google.Simply put, I can't recommend this device to anybody. I really hope they fix the issues, because this has the potential to be great, but at the moment it is not worth the headaches.UPDATE: I've dropped this down to a one star. Many of the issues that were supposed to be fixed in \"future updates\" have not been fixed. The charger is now broken, due to the incredibly fragile tip, and the replacement is still not available through Google. We ordered a charger direct from Samsung, but they sent the charger for the 550, twice. We ordered a third party charger off of eBay, but it only works from time to time.Simply put, if Apple, Dell, Microsoft, or any other tech company put out a product with these issues, it would have a 2 star rating. I appreciate that Google is trying something new; maybe in a year or two it will be better. I've spent 20% of the initial cost of the laptop on chargers that don't work and from looking in forums it seems to be fairly common.", "Date": "December 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Details on the non-browser OS features", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R2LGQOIK6QWP6Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Others have commented about the new Chromebook hardware, and the browser is well-known already (it operates identically on the Chromebook), so I'll comment about the OS features outside of the browser, about which very little information is available. Bear in mind that Google updates the OS frequently, so anything I say is subject to change at any time.There's a new app called Files that's a file manager, analogous to Windows Explorer or the Finder. It always shows two drives: Downloads, on the local file system, and Google Drive. You can copy between them, make folders, rename files, etc.If you mount an SD card or USB drive, you can perform the same operations with those drives, too. I was able to mount a Mac-formatted (HFS) drive, but not write to it. When I tried, I got an error message AND the OS got into a state where it would refuse to copy anything, even if the HFS drive wasn't involved. Rebooting cleared this up.You can't access networked drives (shares) at all.If you have a Google Docs file on a local drive, including the built-in drive, you can open it with Google Docs to work on it, but it seems that there's no way to create such a file from the app. You have to get it there by copying it from Google Drive. This use of a local file is completely different from the new offline capability that the Google Docs apps have. That gives them access to a local cache of the online files, unrelated to the files you see with the Files app. My advice is that if you want to work with those apps offline, do it the official way.Other notes:My bluetooth mouse, which I prefer to the touchpad, worked perfectly.The Chromebook looks very much like my Macbook Air. Same size, same weight, similar appearance. The Air is more refined, and it also costs more than four time as much.I got the Chromebook because when I'm not on my main computers (an iMac or a Windows box) I spend all my time in Chrome. The Chromebook is perfect for this, as others have noted. I was using an Air for this purpose, which it's great at, of course, but so is the Chromebook.When I take photos, I shoot raw. You can copy raw files from a card to another device with the Chromebook, for in-the-field backup, but you can't view the raw files (that is, you can't view the JPEG preview that's inside them). You can on Windows, MacOS, or an iPad. In this respect, an iPad is a more complete field computer for a photographer who wants backup and a little viewing, but, unlike the Chromebook, you can't attach an external drive, and an iPad only has so much internal memory. It works for me while I'm on vacation, but it wouldn't work for a pro. Not enough space.You can certainly upload a raw to Picasa Web and view it there, but this is impractical for the bulk of the images you'll shoot in the field.The above viewing issue applies only to raws. JPEGs work fine.As an experiment, I wrote a text editor as a packaged app, which means it loads locally in Chrome and has full access to local files. It worked fine on the Chromebook, as I would expect. However, it seems that it is tossed out on a reboot, so you have to load it from an external disk each time you boot. As packaged apps are very new and still experimental, this is obviously a temporary issue. I noticed that there's a way to pin the app icon to the launchbar, which is nice.

Here are my initial thoughts after a couple days...* The screen is a little cheap.* The whole design kinda rips of a MacBook Air, but uses a plastic enclosure instead of metal.* It's easy to type on, but the keys feel a little cheap.* It is very light weight.* The OS is very usable, especially if you use a lot of Google web services.* They give you 100 GB of cloud space for buying the Chromebook.* The trackpad is surprisingly good for being so inexpensive.* OS upgrades are painless.* Battery life is decent and sort of accurate at ~6 hours on one charge.* It uses a proprietary charger.* Overall a very simple and clean OS that works well with Google web services.* It has a shell that you can open and SSH to servers.* There is a remote desktop client, but I haven't used it yet.In all, it feels like an inexpensive laptop that is a cheap knock off of the MacBook Air that costs $250. The Chrome OS and the 100 GB of cloud space make this a very good deal. It is a truly disposable computer that is great for web work and web browsing.

I kept looking at various styles of tablets, \"phablets\" and net books.  I didn't want to invest a serious amount of money into a laptop since it wouldn't be something to completely replace my desktop PC, but something to use while on the go.  After months of researching and testing various items, I settled on a Chromebook.  After speaking with several people \"in the know\" about them, I chose to get this Samsung version.Here are a few things that might help you make your decision that absolutely did influence mine :1) You get what you pay for.  Yes Walmart has an Acer version of the Chromebook for $199, but it's kind of shoddy.  Everyone I spoke with had only negative things to say about Acer products and how cheaply they are built.  This version by Samsung for this price point is an absolute steal.2) Don't expect it to replace your fancy Mac laptop (or any other high-end laptop).  It's essentially a tablet on steroids with a built in keyboard.  The OS is very simple to use and understand... even more-so if you are a regular Android user (via phone or tablet).3)  Play Store is your friend !  You can find all kinds of helpful (and also free) apps to download to make your Chromebook even better.  Some apps you might have to pay for ... such is life... but you can seriously bulk up on almost anything you want from the Play Store.  If you have an Android phone and love the things you can add, then you will love being able to put most of the same programs on this.4)  YOU CAN'T STREAM AUDIO VIA BLUETOOTH.... yet.  One drawback that I didn't find out about until after purchase is that YES you can connect to Bluetooth for printing and some headsets that enable chat, but that's it.  Not able to connect to Bluetooth enabled speakers.  That is kind of a drag since I love streaming music, however I do have other means to accomplish this no problem.  However it does bring me to the next issue...5)  The speakers (located on the bottom of the Chromebook) are kind of quiet.  It doesn't get really loud no matter if everything is turned up full blast.  I've found the best way to watch movies or listen to music with it is to simply bring along wired headphones.  That to me is the biggest reason I wanted to connect to a Bluetooth enabled speaker, so that I could watch movies without headphones.  According to chatter on the Google Groups forums though, this is a known issue that Google is working on and hopefully will be addressed and rectified via update soon (connection via Bluetooth for speakers, not increasing the current speaker volume).6)  I bought the $249 Wi-Fi version.  I have no idea how well the 3G version is with internet, but with the Wi-Fi one, simply connect to a Wi-Fi signal and it runs great.  Smooth and fast with no issues at all.  Even viewing Netflix or Amazon Prime Instant has been great with no loading or buffering issues.  It does have the port to install an internet card on your own though, so if you happen to have or purchase one then you are good to go.7)  The touch-pad for the mouse works fine, but you can easily connect a wireless mouse (or wired) as well.  It also has a built in webcam if you fancy such a bonus.8)  It charges fast and holds a charge for a LONG time.  Compared to the other Chromebook versions, this Samsung version has the longest battery life (claims 6.5 hours, mine has been good for up to 8).  The nice thing is where the battery icon is on screen, if you just click it with your mouse it tells you the battery status.  Good info too, not just \"45% battery\".  It actually tells you exactly how much time (say 4h 23m) left before the battery dies.  If you plug it in to charge, it will even tell you how much time until the battery is fully charged.9)  It seriously starts-up and shuts-down in less than 10 seconds.  So far I've been timing the start-ups at about 5 seconds each.  It's super fast and kind of surprising.10)  Lastly, it looks good.  The case, the keyboard, the screen.. it's all great.  Smooth and sexy as they say.Those are all my impressions after having it for a decent amount of time now.  I was highly skeptical at first because I've been a die-hard PC user for years and never really liked laptops or tablets, but this has completely sold me.  Not only would I say this is a great travel computer for work or school... but this would be AMAZING for kids (especially college aged ones).  You really can use Google Docs with this to do pretty much any homework / paperwork and you get 100 GB of cloud storage with it for free.  Combining this with any other Google things you use (phones, Gmail, Drive, Chrome OS) it syncs everything together wonderfully.  It even lets you sign is as different users so you can have multiple people use the device with their own settings and info and keeps them from messing up your stuff.All in all, I would highly recommend this product.

Offline capability is fairly weak, consisting of a few offline sync systems and limited media playback. The design is very sleek, the screen isn't amazing but it is a fairly high quality panel and 1366x768 @ 11.6\" is a decent pixel density.  Speakers are pretty mediocre, but I wasn't expecting much. The processor in this is ARM based, a Cortex-A15 PoP SoC, the Exynos 5250. This means that the processor is very efficient and the device is dead silent, requiring no fan.  It's also very capable, all things considered.  Videos and web browsing may not be as smooth as an iPad in many cases.

If you can't do that, it's probably not for you.Keyboard shortcuts are extremely helpful for getting around, but not necessary.

If you don't define yourself by a brand, then I think the answer is, maybe not.The differences? While the Chromebook may be plastic vs aluminum, the keyboard is very similar. I'm not a display snob so I find the Chromebook's screen fine. To use an automotive analogy, the Chromebook screen is more Nissan than Mercedes in quality, but it is incredibly functional. We use computers for email, research, bill pay and homework. All of those tasks can be done on the Chromebook very easily. Each person can have their own cloud account and personalized the experience simply by logging in. Writing and data entry is quite easy with the great keyboard. You can't do that on a tablet unless you buy a separate keyboard. You may find installed programs that reside on your MacBook Air that haven't yet been replicated on the web, but there aren't many.If you have tons of stuff on your hard drive, you'll have to train yourself that the hard-drive is now in the cloud. But heck, many of us have used Dropbox for years. I also have 4 back-up storage drives that I've used every time we moved stuff from one computer to the next. Now some of those are failing. The cloud solves storage more elegantly and effectively than an external hard drive.For email, I recently redirected our custom family email domain to Google, and find the Gmail interface with our custom email address quite fantastic.Another issue folks may face is music management. While Apple dominated that market for years, the cloud has changed the concept of music storage and play. Stream it on your phone or you computer from the cloud and get the music off your desktop. With Amazon Cloud Player and Google Play you can free yourself from the other expensive music options.I'm not bashing Apple, and working at a online software company I used them as an example of great design. I've also owned 8 Apple computers over the past 10 years. Yet, with the Chromebook you get a get a great cloud experience and can save the $800-1000 dollars. That will be a big  market driver for a generation who find money somewhat tighter than in the past. It also seems like the perfect new category of computer for businesses that have employees doing sales, customer support, and order management.I'm impressed.

I use a computer pretty heavily in both of my occupations, as well as use Adobe Photoshop and some other video editing software as well. Let me just say if you are concerned with being \"limited\" in your activities using one of these- don't be.There is an app for nearly everything that you could possibly hope to do with a \"normal computer.\" Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides take care of Microsoft Office. Pixlr editor is a free photo-editing app that has about 85% of the capability of Adobe Photoshop- and it's free. Tons of productivity and business apps. If you have an Android smartphone and are utilizing any of the Google apps such as Drive, Keep, Gmail, Maps, Calendars, you will find that all of your stuff syncs up beautifully between your phone and your Chromebook.

Using drive on your phone you can access any of your stuff anywhere, anytime.Despite some other reviews, I do not personally feel that the processor is inadequate. No hiccups while watching Netflix or YouTube. You can also watch videos/movies saved to an external harddrive, as long as they are a supported filetype. All of the major ones are supported.Sure, it doesn't have an optical drive. There is almost no reason to have one anymore. It is light, it is extremely thin, there are no annoying fans. I will take that over the ability to insert a CD or DVD any day. My fiance that owns a Macbook (that have notoriously nice keyboards) continuously comments on how nice the keyboard on the Chromebook feels.In short, if you aren't a fan of Google, need an optical drive for some reason, or feel the need to download every program that you have to use or use specific programs that there are no alternatives to, this may not be the computer for you.

My tablet's accelerometer and gyroscope were getting frustratingly slow, my netbook was always slow, and I wanted something with a larger screen and attached keyboard; even though I have a Bluetooth keyboard for my tablet.  Since I am a proficient typist, I tried out the Samsung and the other company's $199 version and was very impressed with the Samsung's keyboard and over-all performance of the computer.  So here are my PROS and CONS:PROS- Fast bootup time and extremely fast from Sleep Mode.  When booting up or coming out of sleep, you will need to wait a few seconds to be connected with your WiFi -- then it's full-speed ahead.- The first time Set Up procedure took under five minutes to sync all my Chrome Browser, from my desktop, bookmarks, extensions, themes, etc. and Gmail contacts, messages, etc.  What a joy to be able to get down to using this new computer instantly.- Trackpad is a joy to use.  I did slow its speed down somewhat to make it less \"active.\"  The two finger movements need a little practice, but once you get use to it the functions are easy to maneuver.- My wireless mouse works perfectly with the Chromebook but I only used it once so far.  The trackpad is so easy to use that I have begun to prefer it -- possibly since I have been using my tablet for 1 1/2 years and there may be this touch transference.- I switched the Search Key to make it a CAPS lock key.  Glad there is this option.- Since I don't plan on doing any word processing, spreadsheets, photo editing, slideshows, etc. on the computer; my searching the internet, doing e-mails, streaming music and television episodes are flawless.- I find the viewing angle more than acceptable.  Sure it does \"wash out\" if you look too far up or down; but the screen's hinge is rugged and stays in place at the most desireable viewing angle.- Even though it is made of plastic and does have a very slight bend if you want to bend it, the computer is rugged and light-weight.  Going from an 8.9\" screen tablet to this 11.6\" computer does put a slight weight to the holding factor, but the computer is very well balance.- I am getting at least the advertised 6.5 hours of battery life.- There is no \"Save\" or \"Save As\" function when doing word processing (or at least I haven't found it); but everything is automatically saved in the Cloud on Google Drive.  That saves a few keystrokes.- Using CTRL-ALT-? is a great idea to see all the functions available with the keyboard when using key combinations.- The volume is more than adequate.  The speakers put out about three times more volume than my tablet.  Sure they are not part of a 2.1 stereo configuration, but they work well.  Using quality earbuds or over-the-ear earphones improves sound quality.CONS- Why is there a Search Key and a Search icon?  This is why I changed the key to a CAPS lock.  A minor annoyance.- Keyboard keys are not backlit.  I suppose that is to keep the cost and weight to a minimum.- No replaceable battery.  For $249 when the battery is depleated -- buy another Chromebook.- One final, minor annoyance:  Opening the Samsung Chromebook is a tight process.  There is a very small opening between the screen lid and the trackpad to \"wedge\" your fingers in to open the computer.  I can see this as a major problem with anyone having larger fingers than mine.  Don't put a flat-head screw driver in the slot and twist -- ha!After four days of having the Chromebook powered up for about 10 hours a day, using it a good four hours and the rest of the time it is in Sleep Mode; I can honestly say that this has been a great purchase and I would buy this device again.

Many reviews rave about it's lightness, and I was somewhat worried it would feel too light, to the extent of feeling cheap. It's almost perfect.KeyboardSome will love this keyboard, I think it doesn't have quite enough resistance, but it's nice enough and gets the job done. I'm a little spoiled coming from a mechanical keyboard.TrackpadBig enough, quality enough, responsive and has good two finger scrolling. A little loud on clicks, but if that's an issue, you may just become a tapper and not a clicker.DisplayFrom reading the reviews I thought the display would be horrible. In reality I think it's quite excellent. I prefer a matte display, and this one is a perfectly fine matte display with enough brightness and enough viewing angles.Battery lifeOne of the prime selling points of this device, and for me almost any other. The battery life on this computer is superb. Much better than my nexus 7, much more capable too. Even with decent brightness, it seems like this thing lasts forever compared to my windows 8 upgraded pc.What it boils down to is, what are you looking for?

I spend most of my computer time doing various word processing activities, and for that my very nice tablet is no reasonable substitute for a desktop computer. This Chromebook however, is perfect. It's inexpensive, lightweight, simple, and ready to use right out of the box.Because it's lightweight and doesn't get hot, it's very comfortable to sit with a Chromebook actually on your lap--something I haven't found to be true with other laptops. The plastic cover looks almost as good as the heavier casings on more expensive laptops, but it is easy to scratch so be careful. I'll review two aspects of the Chromebook--its functionality for word processing and its use as a back-and-forth to school computer for students.For word processing:  I hadn't used Google Docs much before I got the Chromebook, but it's a fine substitute for Word--the only thing I really  miss from Word is the ability to get synonyms with just a right click. I still use Word on my desktop computer, but since Google Docs can turn Word documents into Google Doc documents and visa versa it's possible to go back and forth between Word on my regular computer and Google Docs on my Chromebook very easily. I assumed I would end up wanting to get a bluetooth mouse, especially for the many times that I have to cut and paste while writing, but the trackpad is completely simple to use for this and for everything a mouse does so I haven't bothered. The keyboard keys are nicely spaced, not crowded. One thing I especially love about word processing on the Chromebook is that since it boots up and is ready to go so quickly I can grab a few minutes here and there to write--times that would be impractical on my desktop with its longer come to life time. Also with the Chromebook it's possible to write anywhere, including places without an internet connection since Google Docs can be used off-line.For students:  The students I see in my tutoring business have been very taken with the Chromebook, and after trying mine at least one of my students will be getting her own for Christmas. Her parents had been planning on getting her an iPad, but the Chromebook is both less expensive and more functional. Without buying any extra software students can research, write and print reports, essays or homework on it, and many of my students have already started using Google Docs instead of Word  because it allows for collaboration when they are doing group projects.  Most young people  are comfortable storing things in the cloud or moving things off and on flash drives so the small amount of storage isn't an issue for them , and the Chromebook's light weight is a real plus considering how heavy their backpacks can be. The Chrome Store has a lot of apps, always an enticement, and most of them free. Then there is the cool factor--the Chromebook looks good, and who doesn't appreciate that in an electronic device?I'm not ready to give up my desktop computer, with its large amount of storage and ability to add software, but as a second computer I could not be happier with my Chromebook.

Of course, they did not mention whether or not the liquid damage caused the backlight to go out.

They want to charge me $50 in order to give me a repair quote and if I decide to not repair, I lose the $50.  This is unacceptable.  As we all know, parts cost way more when doing repair.  I have no idea what the price will come out to with repairs but it could easily be more than the $250 chromebook.  I refuse to pay this money and they refuse to tell me what it will cost to fix.

I am a bit of a tech geek and like exploring the different options out there, but certainly LOVED the premium feel and use of my MacBook Pro, however, it is no longer turning on anymore - so here I am at school without a computer.I have been using Google's 'Web Apps' for a while and I find docs/spreadsheets to do 99% of what I need. Otherwise I spend most of my time browsing, doing e-mail etc. The one thing I do use is Photoshop, which needs a more powerful machine than a small portable laptop anyway. Since I'm on a tight budget, and can't justify a MacBook Air (which really is not sufficient for much more than browsing anyway) I decided to spring for the Chromebook and get a desktop to use later on.I am very happy with my purchase, and find my experience to be similar to that of the reviews I have read. The hardware (specifically the excellent keyboard) are really 70-80% of the MacBook experience, with the track pad working very well and the keyboard being equally as good for my uses. This computer is excellent and does not disappoint at all - even when compared to the MacBook family. It is true that the screen is not as nice, but it is very usable, especially when considering the main uses of this computer (browsing, typing, reading articles).I have no problem with many tabs open and find pages to load completely satisfactorily.

I am a principal at a elementary school, and I purchased this to see what it was like, with a mind towards using it with a 1-to-1 initiative next year. My 8th grade son is very computer-literate, so I gave it to him to try out and report about. On the positive side, it seemed to work well while it worked, and he was able to produce pretty good materials with it. He enjoyed using it.However, several months after he received it, it failed. Specifically, overnight it developed a crack from one corner to another, under the glass, that rendered the device worthless. I looked for signs that it was dropped, abused, or something else, even though I didn't see it at home. There were none. To top it off, he had been storing it in the box it came in, for safety, and overnight, it was rendered worthless.No problem, I thought, I will just return it to Amazon. But they will not accept it, due to the several months having passed. OK, I thought, Samsung will do something. Not so. Any damage to the pixels under the screen is not under warranty, and will cost more than the device to repair. So I am out of luck here.When I google \"Samsung Chromebook cracked screen\" I get a whole bevy of hits, mostly inexplicable. When I spoke to an IT person who did computer repair, he just shrugged, but said he had seen/heard of the same problem.So, what did I resolve from this experience?1) Discourage everyone I know from purchasing a Samsung Chromebook due to structural unsoundness, unless it comes with an iron-clad replacement warranty. Even then, the time and effort to get a response from Samsung has pretty much soured me from purchasing anything they make ever again.2) Encourage people not to order this type of equipment from Amazon, since they state in their policy that your only recourse is talking to the manufacturer, and that failed in this case. Newegg or CDW, here I come!3) Keep my eyes open for the inevitable class-action lawsuit against Samsung, where I will end up getting a $13 gift certificate towards a future purchase of their materials, if I am lucky. :)4) Encourage anyone who is skeptical of my claims to look it up on Google before they purchase this product.5) Write my first review of anything on Amazon to inform those who might want to purchase it, to encourage just such a process.In a sense, the experiment worked. I have certainly gotten feedback on our expected purchase of Samsung Chromebooks for our school. So I am not ungrateful.

Intellisol, the company that is handling the repair, will label it as physical damage and tell you to deal with Samsung's customer service if you want to dispute it. Samsung customer service will tell you that they can either send it back to you as is, or you can put down $50 to have it evaluated for out of warranty repair. Then they will provide you with a quote of approximately $180. You can either apply the $50 you put down earlier towards the repair, or lose that $50 and paid shipping on top of it to get your Chromebook back with the cracked screen.

It is absolutely perfect for my needs. I'm not a \"tech geek\" or anything but I definitely appreciate being able to have a laptop which is extremely lightweight and so easy to bring with me just about everywhere. As a college student, this compact device is better than having a tablet as it is compatible with certain programs which the tablet I have is not. It is just as convenient, but more useful to me.I love how simple and quick everything is. Start up is within seconds, no loading screens, no nonsense. Log in and go. Also, shutting down is only seconds as well. My previous laptop had issues with shutdown and I couldn't close the screen until it was completely shut down or else it would interrupt the process. That usually took a few minutes. With the Chromebook, it's click, shut, and go. And shutting down rather than just closing saves battery life, even though that really is not an issue. While being used, it's currently calculating I have 90% battery left which adds up to 7 hours and 12 minutes. This is just great!With the exception of getting used to the placement of the keys on the keyboard (slightly different from a standard keyboard) I really enjoy how quiet typing is. I can sit and work on emails or papers in the library or at night without disturbing anyone because the keys aren't making a loud ticking noise as I am typing.Another feature, which was a huge selling point as I have had issues in the past, is the lack of fan and moving parts. It is very frustrating to have a laptop which can't be placed in your lap because it gets too hot. This laptop is always cool, which the exception of one spot which is barely lukewarm.Getting use to the smaller screen and type was an adjustment at first, but there is a setting feature which allows you to enlarge the type on a page without having to zoom into the screen which I like.Essentially, the Chromebook is great! It takes a little bit of getting used to but the adjustment only takes a short time. I'm sure there are some other things I haven't discovered and I haven't had a chance to get a good look through all of the apps available. The only small complaint that I have is the inability to stream on Netflix. I guess it's not compatible with the OS yet but they're working on it. But it's only a small complaint because I can use my tablet to watch Netflix and in that case I'm able to work on the laptop while watching movies and shows considering both of them are small and don't take up too much space.Overall, I am very happy with my new \"toy.\" I've been bringing it with me everywhere I go!**UPDATE**Should have done this sooner. Unfortunately I had to drop my rating on this product only because within a few months I was no longer able to use it. Due to one fall from a counter top to a carpeted floor, my power adapter apparently suffered some unseen damage. (It landed flat on the bottom as it slid off the counter.) This caused the area around the adapter port to somehow overheat and melt. The damage was not immediately obvious to me and the next time I went to unplug my computer, the tiny metal piece snapped off inside the port itself. Because this was caused by a drop and I sadly had not purchased the extra warranty which covers drops, there was nothing I could do. I've considered purchasing another Chromebook, but with the adapter being so fragile, along with the strange sort of malfunction, I'm not sure I want to take that risk.

However, if what you need to do is limited to working in a web browser and you want a high-value computer (inexpensive), these are superb for a number of reasons:  - On a windows/mac laptop if you lose it you're almost certainly losing some data/customization.  With a chromebook you can buy a new one, login and you're back to normal.  You could easily mix up your and your kid's chromebook and not notice with the exception of stickers.  - You need not manage software.  I'm a software engineer and it drives me nuts having to apply updates and patches and troubleshoot why I can't delete files in windows, etc.  These problems are just not there on a chromebook.  - Guest computer.  Not something I thought I'd care about, but it's really nice to be able to hand this to someone visiting.  It's on your network and they can login with their own account or use the guest mode.  A friend of mine was really amazed when his various chrome plugins and bookmarks appeared.On the downside:  - Chromebooks are not extremely fast.  However, the battery life is excellent and it's quite inexpensive which make up for it.  Perhaps if they are popular enough faster versions will emerge.  I have no problem playing YouTube in full screen, but compared to my primary computer (a high eng macbook pro; over 10x the price) it feels somewhat sluggish.  - There are specific things you expect a computer to do which won't work, or which will need some special hardware or effort.  For example:  - Printing.  You _can_ print, but will need a \"cloud-ready\" printer which you probably don't have OR will need to print via another computer which has cloud-print software setup.  - Legacy software.  You can't use any software that you'd install from media.  Basically anything that this computer will do needs to be in the operating system (chromeos, which will improve over time), or software which is implemented as a web application.  The capabilities of this kind of software is improving as well but you're not going to be able to run things like quicken, word, photoshop, etc.  You can likely find web-variants of this kind of software but it will be different and likely more limited than what you're used to -- at least for awhile.I've also owned an earlier Chromebook, the cr-48 and while the \"matte black\" finish of that unit had it's charm, the Samsung is superior in every way that matters.In summary: If you understand the limitations and benefits of this model you'll be extremely pleased with ChromeOS and the Samsung chromebook.", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Still a work in progress", "Author": "bobpren", "ReviewID": "R98CKT96UNLIR", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this as a Christmas present for my 11 and 13 year olds so they would have their own device to do their homework with, play Minecraft and video chat.

I've been an Android user since 2009.Keyboard is responsive and good quality keys.PriceWebcam - a nice feature for such an affordable device.Lightweight and compactCons:Speed. It lags quite a bit in download speed compared to my Galaxy and my Mac Mini.  This is annoying when I'm trying to get work done on the web, which is the whole point of this device.  It's not what I expected from Samsung. I'm wondering whether, like my phone, it would speed up if I installed an SD card.Display. It looks washed out to me- poor contrast and not crisp. For all I can tell, the only adjustment that can be made is in the Advanced Settings, under 'Accessibility' you can change it to contrast mode, which becomes a black background with light text.  I use this when I create documents because it's truly easier for me to see, but online it's a pain because photos look like negatives. I don't have any vision problems, it's just a cheap looking screen.Touchpad is awkward for me. The click function works with a very light touch, or a heavy push on the pad.  Many times I've clicked a link without intending to when I lift my hand to turn a page or something, then go back to the trackpad.  Perhaps I could adjust this, I haven't tried.Web browser is limited- I think due to lack of ability to install things like Java and Adobe Flash Player.  I notice it when I try to play certain videos online- it just doesn't work, tries to download them instead, but still won't open and play.This is just one person's opinion, but a warning that this device is pretty limited.  Great price, but I'm a little disappointed and find myself not using it as much as I thought.  Why would I, when my Galaxy Note II is so much faster and can do more? The only advantage this has for me is a keyboard, on which I can work much faster than a touch screen.Thanks for reading and good luck!", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great For College Students as a Secondary Computer", "Author": "Chris C.", "ReviewID": "R8FLLMGIFULMT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My name is Chris and I am currently a freshman in college. As a college student, I find the Samsung Chromebook to be extremely convenient. At $250, this laptop is a steal.First off, let me say that this is not your normal laptop. You cannot get Microsoft Office on this device as well as you cannot download really any programs on it. The Chromebook operates on the Cloud and strictly on Google's programs; whether it be G-mail, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Google Keep, etc. So if you are not already a \"Google-ite\", once you purchase this laptop you will become one.The Chromebook laptop has very minimal internal storage space. So your files and pictures and such do not get stored physically on the computer. Your files and pictures and whatever else you might be saving get put on the Cloud on Google Drive. Upon the purchase of your Chromebook, you receive a free 100 GB of Google Drive storage for 2 years. So you don't really need to worry about running out of room in the cloud. This laptop operates solely on Wi-Fi connection. Everything that you do on this laptop is in a sense, on the Google Chrome browser. So you will need internet for almost all functions on this laptop. However, there is an offline mode if you do not have Wi-Fi connection where you can still type up documents and such.If you're trying to decide what computer to get for college and you're going through a rough time deciding if you want a desktop with a laptop, if you want only a laptop, or if you want to go the tablet route, I was in the exact same boat when I was deciding what I wanted. After having been in college now for 2 and a half months now, I am very happy with my decision with the Chromebook. I myself have an iMac desktop computer in my dorm room as my main computer and I take my Chromebook to class. I use it every day and it is works perfectly for in class usage. I will go to class or go to the library and type up whatever I need to on Google Docs or Google Sheets, and if I need to print it out or if I want to edit the format of the document a little bit more, I will download the Google Drive document onto my desktop and then edit them in Microsoft Office. (Sort of a system that I have developed)The one thing about this computer that I have to point out is the battery life. I have found that the standby battery life on the Chromebook is not as good as you think it would be.If you are in search of a portable computer for college, I would definitely recommend this computer to you. It is very convenient, extremely light, and a cute and small size. However, personally I would NOT get this Chromebook if you plan on making this your main computer. The Chromebook is a cheap alternative to a laptop that is best for carrying around in your backpack as an addition to your main computer. I personally find myself using my Chromebook more than I do my desktop computer.However making this laptop your main computer IS doable, it is not IDEAL but it can be done. Really, in this day in age, Microsoft Office is not entirely necessary. Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are pretty good alternatives to Microsoft Office. BUT, the Google word processors do not have nearly as many functions as Microsoft Office has, so be forewarned. The Google applications have all of the basic functions... nothing more.IN MY OPINION:I have looked at other people who use tablets as their in-class computers and I have talked with them to see how they like their decision to go with the tablet route, and most of them say that they regret the decision to go tablet instead of laptop. They claim that it is difficult to keep up with the professor trying to continually type on the touchscreen. (Although there are now keyboards for your tablets). So, as a current college student, I recommend weigh your options before going the tablet route for your in class computer. And I would DEFINITELY consider the Samsung Chromebook.", "Date": "November 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Short lived bliss, long term misery", "Author": "Kenneth A. Ballard", "ReviewID": "R3NBVLK3DVTGAF", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "For four days the Chromebook was everything I wanted. I took it out everyday. Never had a problem getting connected. Had no trouble using Microsofts's web based Word. I told myself I'd save better than $700 by not buying a Macbook Air. Then Friday at my favorite coffee shop, the screen dimmed. I noticed that the battery was close to 10%. I took it home to charge it completely. The next day I still had a too dark screen. My Chromebook is now on its way to Texas. I'm hoping I'll have better success when it returns. If so, I'll give it 5 stars. If not, I'll reduce it to 1 star and buy that Macbook.Update: After owning the Chromebook for less than six months, it has stopped working again. Samsung's over-the-phone support thinks it has been corrupted when I was on MacDonald's wireless network a couple days ago. And for $99 they will fix it, without me having to ship it back. But this is the second major problem in less than six months. I can't see spending $100 on a computer than cost $250 to start with. The Macbook Air is looking better and better.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "A failed experiment", "Author": "B Reed", "ReviewID": "RC9JXHQHIFL35", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I'm a professional writer working on my twelfth novel.  The dream of a second computer as portable as a pad of paper was just too tempting, and I ordered the Samsung Chromebook after Christmas.  Demand is high.  There was a brief delay in delivery.  But the Chromebook arrived on a Thursday, and as promised, it proved to be a very eager machine.The set up was simple and quick.  Google had me synched and flying in minutes.  The screen seemed dim, but I expected that from the reviews.  The keyboard had a good feel.  The touch pad was better than most.  (There wasn't a lot of cursing time.)  But my wireless mouse was slow and sloppy.  So I bought a bluetooth mouse and found the same problem, which meant another trip to the store to get my money back.  A little wired mouse proved good enough, and over the weekend I began settling into my new life as a roving, coffee-infused author.I've been working more and more with Google Docs.  My old laptop has no major problems handling novel-length files, and while there are quirks and kinks with Docs, I love the idea of backing up my ideas while avoiding Microsoft Word.  But the Chromebook wasn't thrilled with files of 80 and 90 thousand words.  Loading was slow.  Navigation was very slow.  Also bothersome was how the cursor didn't quite line up with the words, always hanging a little below.  And worse, that sweet keyboard let me type quickly--too quickly, since the text on the screen was always a couple seconds behind.This wasn't going to end the experiment, but I was seeing troubles with my data.Reviewers love to talk about the \"ecosystems\" of various tech giant.  I like some of Google's options.  Google Play, for instance.  But when it comes to apps, and with movies that can be bought...well, Google doesn't have an ecosystem so much as a weed patch.Again, none of this was causing me soul-searing grief.  It was just bothersome.But then on Sunday night--again, my Chromebook arrived on Thursday--the touch pad quit working.  The tiny plug-in mouse still functioned, but not the touch pad.  I turned off the Chromebook and rebooted.  I did that twice.  (The machine is wonderfully quick, coming back from the dead.)  But the pad remained comatose.  A quick googling for help, and I instantly learned that I wasn't the only customer who had discovered this tendency.I decided to return the machine, printing out the Amazon labels while I started hunting for a replacement.  I ordered one of the last ultrabooks running with Windows 7.  More money by a lot, but that's a short term expense.  $249 dollars is a lot of cash if the toy breaks in four days, or even in a year and four days.Obviously these problems will be solved someday, what with updated software and design changes.  But my book is due in April, and I can't wait.A final note:  The next morning, I turned on the Chromebook to wipe it back to its factory settings.  And the touch pad was working again.Google is a mysterious deity.", "Date": "January 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent product", "Author": "CK", "ReviewID": "R1SM8D5BBJ1LQF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The device I think it's great, maybe according to specifications is not the world's fastest computer, and that made \u200b\u200bme fear a bit about performance, but I confess that it has exceeded my expectations, very comfortable keyboard, the screen size is ideal for everyday tasks, device is pretty light.To test processor speed I was playing Angry Birds and only at the beginning of the game I seem to notice some lag, but the rest of the game was pretty good, offline version did not vary much in game speed but obviously improved the speed of initial load and between each stage.The internet connection is pretty simple and familiar, detects wifi networks available, put the password and go. What surprised me here was that I plugged my Galaxy Nexus via USB, enabled USB tethering and it worked perfectly, without additional configuration or anything. Simply spectacular... but, it works once, next time doesn't work, I don't know why, maybe is a problem with my smartphone's Internet provider, last weeks it doesn't work very well.Device has also options to configure VPN access, but I failed to connect, maybe I get it later and post the tips.Specifications not mention it, but on settings menu there are options for bluetooth devices. I did a search on two smartphones, and Chromebook was not discovered, neither smartphones on Chromebook, so it is only a menu for supporting devices.Applications menu seems simple and precise settings tab is the same way as Chrome browser, with some additional options like Wifi settings, mouse and keyboard, etc..I must confess that the keyboard looks weird without the function keys, but once you use it you realize that you do not need it. The size and spacing of the keys is pretty comfortable. It has a support for keyboard shortcuts (pressing Ctrl + Alt + /), which seem to be very large, but all of them have a utility that amazes, even you can increase or decrease the brightness of the keyboard, if the device supports it. Although the keyboard is in English you can configure to write with accents, \"\u00f1\" and symbols of other languages. Perhaps worst of the equipment are the keys themselves, at first glance seem to be a cheap plastic, the space key when typing sounds somewhat, unlike the other keys, but are soft to press and doesn't have annoying click like other keyboards.The touchpad is simple, has no buttons but allows simple gestures (special moves with two fingers), which make it quite easy to navigate. The drawback I found is that the touchpad itself is a bit harsh, maybe it's my skin but sometimes at dragging fingers the mouse gives some small jumps on the screen, is not serious but could be better. My wireless mouse was recognized and it worked fine except that I could not set higher speed, the maximum offering is not what I would like, but can be a problem with my mouse, should be tested with other models, but is a matter of taste.The built-in webcam offers good quality, but unfortunately on a G+ hangout I noticed that ChromeOS is not supported on some options, such as masks and others. It's disappointing, I found a group on Google Groups where a Google engineer acknowledges the problem and says they are looking for a solution, but the answer is dated 2011, I hope to settle it soon.The built-in speaker sound is great, being located under the machine, in the front, makes the sound heard from everywhere on device, which is fine with me. In fact when I'm writing I am listening blues from my music collection in Google Music and is very nice.For a hangout I could also see that headphone's jack does not accept the microphone built into the headset from my Galaxy Nexus, which I think is strange because the picture on the Chromebook indicates that accepts headphones and microphone.Chromebook lights in just 8 seconds (yes, 8, timed), and pressing the menu option to shut down you do not realize and faded (3 seconds off). When off and lift the lid the system turns on automatically, avoid pressing the power button, which I think is a very good idea, as well as opening the applications you had open when turning off. It takes a few seconds (no more than 5) to reconnect and continue with what you were.When connecting a flash drive it recognizes and displays the files in a small embedded file manager, which also shows a local folder called \"Downloads\" and Google Drive. It strikes me that when connecting my Galaxy Nexus is not recognized and does not show me the files, however when I connect my LG P500 recognizes the 3 partitions I have (normal internal, second partition for Link2SD and SD card). I think maybe they thought the Galaxy Nexus, being a Google product does not need connect to Chromebook and you can get on the web photos and files directly with native applications (auto uploads), perhaps someone don't like it, but I find some logic and does not bother me.The battery is fine so far, charge is quick (2.5 hours to charge) and takes about 6.5 hours as promised.The only thing someone might miss is to have the option to burn CDs / DVDs, but in my case that's no problem, since I have a PC with Linux I can do that.Regarding the use of the same equipment as simple as a web browser, with all standard options that are expected of a modern browser and we know in Chrome.Being Chromebook based entirely on web applications I saw the need to look what applications might need as \"executable\", and so far I have been able to supply all I can think, ChromeOS's help give you several alternatives to common tasks via web. Even I was surprised to find a terminal emulator (telnet, ssh) via Web, which works perfectly.Incredible is the successful integration of hardware and software included, and the ecosystem of \"applications\" that has been created and also integrate well, almost without access to the small inner disc, although some seem 16Gb easily reach the conclusion that you do not need much more, considering that everything is designed for use via the web with a few options to work offline (gmail, docs, some games, etc).In conclusion I think if you are a student, reporter, photographer or any profession that does not need to use Windows applications or business, or just love surfing the web is a great device, with everything you need , and a great price.At least I'm happy with the purchase and I recommend it", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Freezes Constantly", "Author": "andrew brown", "ReviewID": "R2L69PNT0Y4TD1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Returned item, love the laptop but it freezes, samsung needs to fix its hardware and google needs to improve the chrome os, feels like its still in beta testing and we are the testers", "Date": "May 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "The Chromebook I've been waiting for", "Author": "KINETA", "ReviewID": "R5XH6U3TXJ3CK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought an original Intel Atom-powered Samsung Series 5 wifi for over $500.

The points below are made in consideration of the $249 price:Hardware: Simply amazing.  While there are many laptops that approach or equal the Chromebook for sleekness and many offer superior materials, all of these options are 3-6x the Chromebook price.  The keyboard feels great, the trackpad is sizeable and responsive.  Even closing the laptop is a joy.  The hinge resistance drops off at about 10 degrees where precise detenting provides an almost magnetic pull to close the device fully shut.  Lastly silicone bumpers complete the closure with a reassuring \"thump\" rather than a plasticy \"slap\".  This effect combine with the extremely thin result make me smile a little every time.Keyboard: I do wish some keys such as tab switching and full screen were provided in place of the window switching and maximize keys.  Also, I'd enjoy \"home\" and \"end\" buttons.  Overall the plastic appears durable and is the right material for a cheap laptop that will be obsolete within 2 years (the lifetime suggested by google's 2 year cloud storage service)Screen: The display is good.  I know that high end laptops have much nicer displays but many offer the same quality as the Chromebook.  The real story is how high end laptops are incorporating $80 displays not that the Chomebook falls short of an Apple retina.Camera: The user facing camera (webcam) is only VGA but is decent under low light and angled just right.  I haven't tried the mics yet but there are 2 of them so I'm guessing it's fine.Speakers: can get very loud and sound good on hard surfacesPorts: the headphone jack is reassuringly tight.  I haven't tried the HDMI, SD, or USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports.Computation: ARM processing was the right choice for the device.  At times, I can't help but feel the device is slightly underpowered; opening a few heavy webpages can cause Rdio to stutter very briefly.  However, I've managed to adjust pretty quickly to this minor limitation by keeping fewer tabs open.  ARM really shines with regard to thermal performance.  Even as I write these words in a warm room with the Chromebook on my fleece pajama pants, the laptop is barely warmer than my skin.  The dead silent operation and lack of an exhaust breeze (or any moving internals at all) is extremely reassuring initially but quickly you stop thinking about such things entirely which is probably the point.Chrome OS: The OS currently has a few limitations and bugs.  Loading a dozen tabs can cause some to refresh and I've seen reports of some folks losing long posts during these refreshes.  I write my posts in google docs which auto saves every few seconds so this isn't much of an issues for me.  Some pages like Amazon instant videos and Netflix streaming (hulu works well) aren't yet compatible with Chrome OS (apparently both are being worked upon).  I switched to the dev channel which allowed Amazon prime streaming to work initially but it has since stopped working.  Most other things work very well.  WiFi connections work very well and quickly.  I have a tethering shortcut on my phone which allows me to launch tethering, pop open the chromebook and with a few seconds be loading pages.  The screen wakes up after opening the lid within 2 seconds (~10 seconds from full rebooting).  Heavy pages load within seconds and perhaps only 1-2 seconds slower than on very fast SSD driven desktops.  My guess is that Chrome OS on ARM isn't yet fully optimized and that every 6 weeks (google's update cycle) the Chromebook will get slightly faster.Apps: I haven't played with these too much but I've found that Citrix doesn't work for either my wife or my work logins.  I use Keepass as my password manager and this isn't supported in the Chrome App store (I switched to LassPass).  Chrome Remote Desktop is very easy to set up (perhaps I can help mom with tech support now!) but I haven't turned on my desktop much since I got this toy...  Other random things like FitBit syncing via ANT likely won't work anytime soon.  Over the weekend I'll be setting up cloud printing and hopefully getting access to my network accessible storage thru the Synology app.  My hope is that as Chrome OS gains popularity, more developers will make more and better apps.Extras: 100 GB of cloud storage is very generous and I doubt I'll be able to fill it anytime soon.  The 12 GoGo in-flight passes will be very enjoyable during future flights and will be just about right for 2 years.  While I wouldn't have purchased $250 worth of these extras - it feels like a great deal to make use of them.As you can probably tell, I'm pretty happy with the Chromebook.  Although the device clearly isn't a \"full computer\", the cheap price allows me to put more money into my desktop machine to make it an even better media machine.  More importantly however, the limitations of the Chrome OS experience (closing extra tabs, a lack of system notifications, desktop files, etc) combined with the refreshing lack of heat or noise, allow for a distraction free experience.  The closest technology analogy is probably reading on a kindle.  I'm happy that Google hasn't felt compelled to incorporate Android into Chrome OS.  In time this may work but for now I'm happy to be in \"work\" mode on my Chromebook.  When it's time to play, I'll pick up my Nexus 7 or plot down at the desktop.

I saw a bunch of skeptical video reviews that were not so great but on Amazon the people who had actually purchased it like myself loved it.  My last device was an Acer Netbook that I paid $299 for years ago.  I bought it on a whim when I was traveling to another country just for Skyping back home and the option of being able to store photo/video on the hard drive.  I didn't think it would turn out that I used that little Netbook for everything but now I that I was looking for a replacement and based on my experience working with just the Netbook I wondered if I could do without an OS in general.  I did some serious thinking about what I actually do with my laptop I took the dive away from a full OS!Part of my decision.  Windows in general.  It's a good OS and tries to be everything to everybody but when it comes to my laptop it is too sluggish.  It's not their fault.  But, I didn't like being forced to Windows 8 metro desktop.  I can quickly learn it...but...nah.Also I was tired of antivirus, installing programs, spyware and having toolbars forced onto me that I have to uninstall.  You ever install something and then another program comes up and tells you it's scanning your registry and cleaning files?  Hate that.Another decision to give up full OS at least on my laptop:  My old Netbook is 5 times slower than when I bought it, not because I put anything new on it but because of hundreds Microsoft security patches and updates.  You ever have someone waiting on you? \"hold on I'm booting\".  \"Oh wait, updates\".  We're all used to it but it doesn't have to be this way.Earlier this year I defected from IE to Chrome as well.  A year ago if Chrome \"magically\" installed on my PC I'd immediately uninstall it and send a nasty message to Google telling them to f*** off.  But Microsoft stupidly put this banner on IE to try Bing vs Google as a challenge.  The searching was the same but the services were better Google.  And if you run those services on Chrome they are more tied in like auto-translation for languages and voice activated searching.Cloud computing / Internet privacy:Ironically I am not a fan of cloud computing for one reason only.  The NSA has forced all major companies to comply with the government's monitoring our data.  Do I have anything to hide?  Yes, my privacy.  When I use cloud services I save everything locally.  Docs, personal videos/music are on my USB hard-drive or SD card.  Yeah I know I'm working with files on the internet but I do what I can to minimize my exposure.VPN for work.  Yes you can.  I saw a bunch of post with people saying they can't use VPN.  But once connected it's all web based.  Chromebook supports L2TP and OpenVPN.  There is no support for SSL though.VPN for bittorrent.  I'm not sure but most those guys use PPTP right?  Even if you got your VPN working and bittorrent over web I would not suggest bittorrenting on Chromebook.  On a Chromebook you're always logged in and Google follows you around like herpes so no sense in a secure VPN connection if they can tell who you are.Blah blah blah...What about the Chromebook...It's about the size of a Macbook Air and weighs 3 lbs.  You can go look at it at Best Buy and compared the 2 models.  Yes I know it's no comparison; just for weight and size.  Man the price-tag was too much to resist for a useful device of this size.  I ordered the 3G model for $268 + free shipping.This Chromebook boots up in 8 seconds flat and goes from sleep mode in less than 1 second.  That means ready to use, not giving you a desktop and hard drive grinding for another 5 minutes.  You can't install anything on it so it won't slow down and I'm hoping it stays this way.You can install Ubuntu on Chromebook on top of the Chrome OS too if you really want an OS on there to run programs.  Basically Linux is running and you switch to it with a Ctrl-Alt combination.  Search Ubuntu and Chromebook on Youtube if interested.Ports:Headphone jack:  Not as loud as I like but sufficient. I'm sure I can work around this if I spend more than $10 on earbuds. hahaUSB 2.0 and USB 3.0!  I bought a Western Digital passport 1TB drive for $64 on Amazon which is USB 3.0.  Really fast.  Even the Chromebook Pixel does not have USB 3.0.  Go figure.  It of course has a SD slot for transferring photos/videos from your camera if needed.Ethernet:  No ethernet port but according to documentation you can buy a USB ethernet port.The ARM processor is nice as there is no fan sound, very little heat.  The harddrive is fast SSD memory so no harddrive sound.  I've watch 3 movies on it without battery running out.  The power cord is sufficiently long.The Chromebook is plastic and I understand it scratches easy so I bought a shell for it.  I bought the following hard shell and it fits perfectly, makes the Chromebook sturdier.$16 - iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6\" Samsung ChromebookTouchpad:  The touchpad feels a little gritty but it works.  $268 remember.  I like the 2 finger scroll and 1 touch click.  I rarely click the touchpad except for the `right-click'.Keyboard:  This keyboard is ok.  It feels more like a PC keyboard than a laptop keyboard.  No function keys (F1-F12).  I've only missed my F2 key for when I am using Excel remote on my desktop.  NO DELETE KEY.  This is frustrating and almost a deal breaker but I'm dealing with it.Press CTRL-ALT-\"/\"  for keyboard shortcuts on the Chromebook.Speaking of Remote Desktop:I love the Remote Desktop.  I'm pretty sure it's the easiest I've setup and use.  This is just an App.  To use remote desktop to your PC make sure Chrome is installed and enable remote desktop.  If you want to allow others to connect you can also.  Once setup, you can sign onto your Google account from anywhere and remotely control your PC.  I pulled up Photoshop and Movie Maker and was able to use those programs just fine from my Chromebook remotely with little or no lag.I was initially planning on installing Ubuntu on my Chromebook but I can just remotely run any programs on my PC.  I supposed this would be a rare occasion and my PC is on all the time; Remote Desktop just wakes it up from sleep mode.  I could edit a photo save on my PC and send it to myself but most likely I'll be using Photoshop Express which is free online.  I didn't even know about all these services until I was forced to look.Printing:There is Google Cloud print but honestly I'll just do like I always have with my Netbook and copy the file to a thumbdrive then print it on another computer.Offline:There are a lot of people who say they need to edit their documents offline but I guess I'm not one of those.  Even when my Netbook (full OS) was in my car offline it was worthless to me without internet.  There is an offline mode for Gmail where you can edit mail offline but I have not tested documents but that's not why I bought the Chromebook.  I'd use it for movies or music offline at the airport but I don't need to edit a document.  But if I did...3G!!!I paid extra for the 3G not because I plan to use it all the time but I have too often wanted internet in the middle of nowhere for an email I was expecting or maybe a map of where I was.  The 100mb per month free data is all I'd ever use.  At least I have the option even if I had to pay for it in an emergency.Google Docs:  You can save in Word, Excel and even PDF format.I like it just fine.  I thought I'd flip out with seeing the splash screen for Word but now that I'm using Google docs I find it faster to load and work.  I'm using both Office and Google docs online now.  I think I'll end up using just the online eventually just because I don't use all the advanced features of Word and Excel on my PC and I'm lost with the new features sometimes.  I can't decide whether I like Google's services for editing documents or Microsoft's webapps.[...]Also there is a good online editor named ZohoWhat I wish I had known is you can save documents as PDF.  I don't know how many times I searched for a PDF converter.  Google has it free online.  Open Word, save-as PDF.You can edit a document on your Chromebook and walk over to a PC and type where you left off.  You can even reboot your Chromebook and it will come right back to where you were....I just rebooted and it automatically came back to this point in this document I'm typing.  Yes I'm typing this review in Google Docs and going to paste to Amazon.  Total reboot and back to editing was 22 seconds.  If I had rebooted on PC I could have taken a break.  I'm not dogging PC.  I'm just trying to let you know why I like the speed of not having a full blown OS.Netflix:Netflix works in full 1080p thru HDMI or 1366x768 locally.  No setup, just click the Netflix icon, login once and select your movie.  No having to mess with Silverlight or whatever is required on PC.Skype/Facebook video:Nope!  This is a negative.  Not that Microsoft can't make Skype online with html-5.  They just haven't done it.  I don't know what's going on with Facebook video chat either.  Chromebook is new so I hope they update this.  Just a couple months ago you couldn't use Netflix either but it's working now.  I could see this as being a deal breaker for some who use Skype all the time.  Me?  I'm sure I'll need it eventually and either they'll fix Skype or I'll have to beg someone to add Google Hangout to their Google profile.Facebook IM works ok.Also:AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) AIM Express ([...])ICQ Web-ICQ ([...])Windows Live Messenger Windows Live Messenger for the WebYahoo! Messenger Yahoo! Messenger for the Web (webmessenger.yahoo.com)Life without programs:Sure enough within 1 day of getting my Chromebook I needed to installed a program that I would have preferred to installed on my laptop; some test software for studying for a CLEP exam.  I put it on my PC but it would be nice to use it on my laptop.  I'm so lazy I remote controlled my PC to use the program even in my own house instead of walking to that room anyway.  But yes I decided to give up the OS on my laptop for the speed and ease.Apps:I looked through the App store.  Not much for apps yet that I cared about and there are hundreds.  There are a few photo editing programs but I'll edit on my desktop.  The only one I used was the Kindle App to read Amazon books.  One click and was reading my books.  Kindle books to read offline!No JAVA:I'm not an expert in java but I'd seen headlines of security holes in Java and Chrome does not support it.  I guess if you're considering buying a Chromebook install Chrome browser on your PC and make sure you can connect to all your sites that you normally go to first.  Like work, school, banks, etc..Video/Audio formats:I was lucky.  My whole video library is either MP4 or MKV.  You will not be able to read WMV without converting them.  If you use iTunes your whole media library would have to be uploaded to Google drive. For MKV video, I have not been able to use subtitles on video however but I have not looked too closely.Ok...this started as a review but ended up a novel.  I am just trying to be helpful and share my excitement about this new idea of having a bare bones computer.  I was looking for a small laptop with a keyboard, 3G, that played 1080p HDMI to TV, and could do some minor document editing that was fast.  I will always need a PC for home when I do video editing/games but this was a good replacement for my Netbook needs.I'm so sold on it I don't think I will ever carry a device with a full OS outside of the house ever again.  If you handed me a $1000 Windows laptop and said here surf the web with this I'd be like \"Naww..get that slow thing away from me.\"  I don't have the patience.FYI - Chromebooks came out at $499 but are now sub $300.  The sales are 25% of all non tablet sales this year.---------------UpdateSpeaking of Photoshop.  This was the only thing I really cared about when thinking about buying Chromebook.  I'm starting to use Photoshop Express online.  It seems to have everything I would us for normal photo editing.  Also the battery time is quite nice.  So far so good.---------Update againAfter about 3 weeks with the device I returned it.  After my big excited review too.  The deal breaker?  Watching movies.  I watch movies 90% of the time on my laptops/ultrabooks when traveling and in bed.  The night time contrast on the screen I didn't like.  In the dark the white parts of the screen are ultra white and if you turn down the brightness you cannot see anything else meaning the darker areas are almost completely dark, no in between.  Sound.  Not on speakers but from the headphone jack.  I didn't know you could make cheap headphone jacks.  They sounded bad no matter what headphones I put in, no bass or treble and also the jack slipped out often. I had a feeling this would eventually break.  It was cheap so you know?  This was my own personal decision though.  I still rate it a 5 for what you pay and I miss the idea of not being stuck with an OS.  Unfortunately becuz I was so anal about this I paid double for a 11.6 Acer S7 1080p ultrabook.  Ouch..but it was my birthday.  If they had a better Chromebook I'd get one but they are either $250 or $1500.  No in between.  I miss the simplicity of chromebook though  I was forced to Windows 8.  I put classic shell on right away and changed all my file associations so I don't ever see the metro desktop.  bitter sweet man.

I've owned many gaming laptops and other powerhouse notebooks that would blow this thing out of the water peformance-wise, but this Chromebook is sleek.I was using the original Motorola Xoom tablet for the longest time as my intermediate internet device (the one between my smart phone and desktop). I was always plagued with shoddy word processing and web functionality on there and I wanted something with a bit more focus on the browser.I didn't get this Chromebook to play games. I got it to be a bit more productive on the internet. Since Chrome is my current most favorite browser on any platform, I was immediately familiar with the OS. It has a dockbar where you can put your programs. Settings are managed through the browser. Offline apps are also used through the browser, but that's not a problem.The music playback is nice. The video playback is great. My only concern is that it won't play certain video files like AVI's and WMV's. MP4's work fine. MPEG's work fine. 3gp files from phones work fine. There are a myriad of other video types that work great too. I wish there were some other way of playing those, but that's my only gripe.Netflix, Youtube and other video sites work smoothly on HD video. Sometimes it hangs up a little but stepping down a size usually fixes it.Browsing files saved to the internal 16GB SSD is easy. Even the 100GB of free Google Drive space is helpful for storing files. The SD and USB ports are very functional and sleek. They give me extra options of storing my videos, music and more.Word Processing is done through web apps mostly. This is nice for having a cloud back-up of your stuff. If you're offline, using Google Docs is your best bet.It took a bit to get used to the functionality of the touchpad. Two finger touching to scroll or \"right click\" was a little offputting at first. But I'm used to it now.Screenshotting is easy. Ctrl+[  ]]] takes an immediate snapshot of what's on your screen.The gallery offers some simple photo editing that even as myself, being a professional photographer can find useful if I need to simply adjust brightness, contrast and cropping.The webcam, while not the best resolution or quality, does it's job fine. Google Hangouts is the only functioning webchat service I've found that works with the camera. Forget it if you have Skype. This won't work with it.Websites function correctly on this computer with the built-in flash player. HTML5 works fine as well. Any Windows Media plugins will not function. Ad Block Plus is available as a plugin for this laptop, eliminating annoying ads, popups and the likes.Great product for the price. Excellent for students and professionals alike.The battery life if you dim the screen will last for about 5 hours realistically. More like 3 hours if you have it full brightness. It is very thin and fits into a paper folder just fine. I slip it into a hidden pocket in my backpack and no one will know be the wiser.The charger comes with a sufficiently long cable. The converter brick isn't overly heavy or annoying. It even comes with it's own retention strap to keep the tangles away, freeing you of hassle and stress. This packs on airplanes great and isn't cumbersome to remove from under a seat.I give it a 5/5 and will likely be using this laptop for many years to come.", "Date": "July 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disadvantages outweigh the good stuff.", "Author": "SamF", "ReviewID": "RW3OGXVCDFDKD", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've been using the Chromebook for about 6 months now.  I like that it is lightweight and boots up quickly.  The trackpad and the keyboard also work well.Beyond that, however, it offers more frustration than enjoyment.  This is largely due to Chrome OS rather than the hardware.  When I purchased the laptop, I thought that Chrome OS would be continually refined and polished.  After all, it was developed by Google.That hasn't really been the case.  This is particularly apparent when it comes to watching streaming video over the internet.  Only very recently has it become possible to watch videos from Netflix, and that was because of changes that Netflix made.  There is little codec support in Chrome OS, and recent patches to the OS seem to have actually degraded the Chromebook's capability to watch things like YouTube videos.  There are frequent hangs, stutters, crashes, etc. even with no browser extensions loaded.Also, to prevent the Chromebook from going to sleep while doing something like streaming music, you have to download a third-party extension.  Chrome OS doesn't even let you change the power management features without a workaround.

That said, I split my time between both, as both are pretty good experiences.Battery life is 6.5-8 hours on a 2-cell battery--wish they'd sacrificed some weight to give it a 4-cell for a 12-14 hour life though.

I bought it primarily for travel because I wanted something small and light.  I'm now also using it as a second laptop when my kids are using the other one.  I got my unit about a month after I ordered it.The unit starts up immediately upon opening, and shuts off in three seconds.  The body isn't quite as pretty as Macbook Air due to the awkward hinge.  The wireless connection is strong and it never drops a signal.  HDMI seems to function well.  I was able to stream ESPN3 onto my TV without problem.  I'll focus my review on the 3G feature since I haven't seen too many reviews on it.3G FeatureThe 3G feature was easy to set up.  Once you click on the setup box on the bottom right of your screen, it takes you to a  VerizonWireless site where you register online with various plan options.  It also assigns what looks to be a phone number for the account.  I selected the free option which gives you 100MB of data/mos. for two years.  The couple of other options I recall seeing are one that's based on the amount of data you select that expires after 30-days, and an unlimited data for a day for about $10.  Nice to have when you've exhausted your free allowance and you're in need of connection.  Having the flexibility to buy only the amount of data for as long as you want is a great option to have because it doesn't force you to commit to a long-term deal.  And since its Verizon, the coverage should be excellent.  I've been using the 3G for almost a month now, primarily to check my personal email at work, and so far I haven't run out of my monthly allowance yet.  For a paltry premium of $80 over the wifi unit, what you get from the 3G unit is not only 100MB of data, but more importantly, access to 3G Verizon network.  Most of the time, I'm on wifi, so the plan works for me. When you're in an area without wifi, it automatically connects to 3G.The unit also comes with 12 free sessions of Gogo inflight internet access on a plane.  Each session, if purchased separately, costs $14 so its quite a deal!  When you start your Chrome on a flight with wifi and select Gogo, it'll recognize your unit and also recognize how many sessions are remaining.  You punch in a security code on the screen and you're on line.  It's that easy.  I had a chance to use it twice on couple of American flights and it worked great.  The only down side is that the signal on the plane is not sufficient to stream video.  I tried to watch a movie on Amazon Prime and it took so long to load the video that I gave up.  I also tried to do a video chat with my daughter using Google+.  I was able to talk with her and send IM, but the video portion didn't come through, although toward the end of our short session, my daughter did tell me that she was able to see the old man.  I did watch a movie via hotel wifi off of Amazon Prime without much problem, so I'm sure it was the signal on the plane that was lacking.The only drawback for me was the quality of the screen.  I would've gladly paid another $50 to have a better screen than the one they put in.  I suspect it'll be fine for most folks, but for someone getting on in years and one that needs a new eyeglass prescription, it may be a small issue.  For that, I'm knocking off 0.5 star.I also ordered the Case Logic 12.1\" Laptop Sleeve.  At first I wasn't sure if I would like the handle because it looks a bit dorky.

It also works on Wifi and I can switch to Verizon 3G at any time. Chromebook 3G comes with 2 years of 100MB per month of Verizon Mobile. After that you can purchase a plan or you can turn on 3G for one month at a time, or not at all.  Chromebook 3G works equally well on Wifi and on 3G.  It's very easy to switch from one to the other.

I have been using Google Docs for a long time.  Uploading and storing Word and Excel files is easy and efficient.  You have a choice of how to store the documents and spreadsheets.  My longest Word document at present is about 200 pages.  My largest Excel spreadsheet has 11 worksheets.  I have not had any problems.  I can view and edit my files in the Google Drive. You can download your files to your computer at any time, and you have the option to download them in Word or Excel formats or in other formats including PDF.Cloud computing makes it possible to access your data from ANY computer.  You NEVER have to purchase a larger hard drive (or an extra one) for your computer.  How many times have you purchased a computer only to learn in a short time that it did not have enough hard drive space to store all your files?  The same holds true for RAM.  In cloud computing the programs are in the \"cloud\".  You use the program in the cloud and when you turn off your computer the program is still in the cloud. Computer viruses?

This thing boots up seconds (still amazes me every time I use it), always brings up what you've been working on, and syncs everything flawlessly. I get so much done in those spurts of time.

Typing and opening excel spreadsheets (accounting major) has worked great and transfers onto my big ol' laptop without a problem because everything's online and ready to go.

There is a trade-off between battery life and CPU speed, because the Samsung 5 was slower (to the point of being a negative) but the battery life was 9+ hours - really.  I downloaded movie AVIs and literally watched movies for a 6 hour flight.  So, overall I am happy with the trade-off and like the beefier CPU with 6 hours of battery.

You can not add software unless you put it in developer mode, which you can clearly see warnings to avoid confusion.  No malware can exist and Google has hacking bake-offs to find and pay information security researchers.Overall, the 'Poor Mans MacBook Air' is a total winner at $250.

I have/had the first Samsung chromebook, Chromebox, 550, and now just received the new $249 Chromebook today.For $249 it is a steal. Great looks (80% of a Macbook Air). I wanted to focus this review to give insight to people already using other chromebooks.1) Screen - The screen is nothing like the first 2 versions from Samsung. This is a cheaper screen that is very noticeable side by side. Many others mention about the viewing angle losing brightness, I agree. I also have a cloudy into (almost the wrong hue) on my screen. Very similar to my first notebook in 1998. Samsung, if you have a better option -please use it. This is the most glaring thing versus the 550.2) Design - LOVE IT! After comparing the two, I want the screen of the 550 pushed into the form factor of this new one. Measurably more thin without the rounded plastic feel that has dogged the first two Samsung chromebooks.3) Sound - It is like going back to the original Samsung chromebook. Almost half the volume of the 550. Ok, but don't expect the volume.4) Speed - Do not notice issues here.In summary, I would love if they made an option for $50-$100 more with a 12.5\" - 13\" higher quality screen (seems like enough room, as there is a large bezel around this new one). Also wished they would upgrade the speakers and volume. Put these two things into the current size and design and you have a STRONG business/higher end machine (for $299-$349, no more $449 chromebooks please as it defeats the purpose). That said, this is a great value for what it is and I strongly feel every house should have this laying around (you will use it more then a tablet).

Potential users who avoided Chromebooks for this reason were missing the point, but still they stayed away.With the launch of the new model Chromebook as well as the earlier Chromebox, and with some recent changes to the Chrome OS, I think that the Chromebook's time may finally have come. This is because several things have happened since the first Chromebooks were launched in 2011:* The Chrome OS has been given a \"desktop\" style interface, which makes it more \"familiar\" to traditional PC users.* The ability to use the Chromebook off-line (not connected to the Internet) to edit documents and to play media files from a USB stick or SD card (or from your Downloads folder) has been improved.* Windows / Intel \"ultrabooks\" have come on the market; which has played into Google's hands by raising the price that users expect to pay for a sleek, fast start-up \"netbook\"... thus making Chromebooks now look more reasonably priced.* The new October 2012 Chromebook is in any case much more reasonably priced, it looks nice, and it performs well.* Finally, with the plethora of touchscheen tablets and the introduction of Windows 8, the Chromebook may have found a niche by sticking with the more traditional keyboard + touchpad + screen format.You don't get a manual with your new Chromebook (or with any computer these days) but The Chrome Book (Second Edition) was published to coincide with the new model Chromebook.", "Date": "November 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for Surfing", "Author": "P.

The files such as Google Docs or Spreadsheet, they are online files that are stored in Google Drive. What this means is: You can't access your files unless you have it in your Flash Drive. Because this doesn't have hard drive-which can be a pro because that's what allows it to be slim.

First of all, when I first took it out of the box and booted it up for the first time, it was really buggy, the touchpad was wonky, things loaded very slowly, and it was just really bad. However after I shut it down and rebooted it (all of which took only 15 seconds by the way, which is fantastic), I was told that Chrome was now downloading a \"critical update.\" After this, things have just been amazing. This really is a testament to how far and fast Chrome has and can improve. Plus, there's an update for Chrome every ~6 weeks which just makes things absolutely amazing.  KEYBOARD: in a word, amazing. The island- style chiclet keys have great travel and feedback, are extremely comfortable and easy to type on, and within the first 30 minutes of using the Chromebook I was typing error free and at my usual speed. The keyboard is probably one of the best features of this laptop. There's also function keys up top that control brightness, volume, and various other things, which is really handy.  TRACKPAD: I love this. It feels great and works just like the trackpad on higher-end machines. Two-finger scrolling works great, and while there is the occasional hiccup where it doesn't register the second finger, it's a very minor thing and doesn't happen often. There's also three/four finger gestures that allow you to navigate between different tabs if you swipe left/right on the trackpad with three/four fingers. And as expected, there's tap-to-click as well as standard press-trackpad-to-click. My only wish is that Google/Samsung would add pinch-to-zoom gesture on the trackpad.  BATTERY: in addition to the keyboard, this is one of the shining features of the Chromebook. As a test, I used it today from 12:45 PM nonstop until 6:10 PM, browsing, reading, and watching tv shows. I bet if I didn't stream any video it could've lasted even longer. There's no question whether or not this will last a full day of work/school- it definitely will. And if you're working offline, maybe on the train or on the bus, it'll probably last even longer. The battery is wonderful- one of the reasons why I chose the Samsung Chromebook over the Acer C7 version, which has an estimated battery life of only 3 hours.  SCREEN: very standard. It definitely is usable, sure, but it's not going to blow your socks off with colors, resolution, or anything like that. It gets the job done, and the matte finish helps it with glare, but the brightness has to be set at about 75-80% brightness to view comfortably.  CHROME OS: a mixed bag. If you're comfortable with Chrome already and already use Google's vast suite of online products (i.e Gmail, Youtube, Maps, Drive, Search, Translate etc) you'll have no problem with it. However, if you depend on desktop programs such as Photoshop, CAD, offline MS Office (there's SkyDrive which is basically MS's online word processing program- sort of like what Google's Drive does), you'll either have to find basic replacements from the Chrome Web Store, or simply make do without them. Not only that, once you're offline your Chromebook's functionality is severely limited. You can still edit and create documents and such on (offline enabled) Drive, and view and compose new emails on the Offline Gmail app, and some other things if you find the right app for it, but mostly, there isn't much you can do once you're out of range of a WiFi hotspot. If you plan on using this at home 24/7 however, this shouldn't be a problem.  BUILD QUALITY: not very good. While the plastic is solid and feels sturdy enough, it's very easily scratched, so it's best to purchase a sleeve or case of some sort to keep it safe whenever you're not using it. In fact, it's so easily scratched, I've already found three or four scuffs and scratches on the top and bottom even though I've literally carried it around on a pillow, and used it on top of the foam that came in the packaging. Very unpleasant. But for the price, I guess that's a tradeoff you'll have to live with.  WRAPUP: I'm very pleased with this. It works like I expected, has great battery life and keyboard quality, and although the screen isn't that good, and the build quality is less than stellar, they're two things I'll just have to live with. Just know what you're buying, folks. This isn't an ultrabook nor is it even a standard laptop. It's a Chromebook, and if you buy this expecting to GET a Chromebook, you'll be quite happy. Don't buy this expecting the same functionality of a full-blown Windows or OSX machine, because you will be disappointed. For it's purpose, it's a great device.  However, I have recently come across some complaints online about the screen spontaneously breaking on its own without even being touched or dropped or damaged in the least. I have no idea what might cause this, and my Chromebook seems to have no problem so far, but I really hope those are isolated occurrences.  I'll update this review as time passes if anything comes up, or if my views change, but until then feel free to leave any questions you guys might have. I'll try to help the best I can!-------------------UPDATE 1:  I recently bought a case for my Chromebook- it's called the iPearl mCover case. It's a snap-on plastic shell for the top and bottom, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to protect their Chromebook. This laptop on its own feels very thin and flimsy, but now it's much more solid with the case on it. I've also written a review on the case on the product listing here: iPearl mCover Hard Shell Case for 11.6\" Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi or 3G) laptop - CLEAR (and for anyone wondering, I am not advertising for this company. This is my honest experience with their product).-------------------UPDATE 2:  After using the Chromebook for multiple months, I can safely say that this is a great computer who does the majority of their work online. The battery life continues to be great, with 5-6 hours of continuous use (or about 3 when streaming video). One complaint I have is how the Chromebook ships with a proprietary charger (micro-USB port like the HP Chromebook 11 would have been far more handy and convenient). The keyboard keys and trackpad feel as responsive and clicky as ever as well, and everything in general has been great even after extended use. I have not experienced the 'spontaneous screen crack' that other people have been victims of, for which I am very glad. It seems those issues really are only limited to earlier models, and that the build quality issues have been ironed out.", "Date": "August 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is not a laptop", "Author": "Jeff Sauri", "ReviewID": "RYF363DZM43HI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you can wrap your mind around the fact that this is not a laptop, and if you are invested in the Google ecosystem, you will love this device.

It is super fast, light, and quiet (solid state drive).  As the Play Store gets more useful apps, it becomes more useful.  I can use Chrome's remote desktop to connect to my work computer (even without the VPN!).  I stream music, movies, and books from Google Play, Hulu, and Vudu.  The OS patches itself, so you don't need to patch Adobe and Java and SPx and antivirus and all that.  Every time you boot it checks for updates and installs if necessary.

When I bought it, I imagined it as a computer I could use for travel and at work to replace my aging laptop. First, the battery life is wonderful. I don't even bother bringing the charger with me to work.The computer connects to the internet fast and easy, and initial setup was a breeze. Since I already had a Google account, everything synced right up - all my files, email, docs, blogs, ect was right there waiting for me. My next step was to set up some apps. These are not traditional apps as you would find on a phone or table, but more like links to a web page. Thats fine, and it really did not make a difference. Since I use Chrome on all my computers, everything again sync'd right up. This computer serves many purposes for me - web surfing checking email, and even watching movies and online content. It boots up fast and is ready to go in seconds.Of course, there are drawbacks. First, it's not a traditional computer. So no programs, CD drives, Microsoft office or any of that stuff. Second, Flash support needs to improve; not every web page is 100% supported. And last, if you have a lot of tabs open, it slows down, but all computers would do that.Who would best benefit from a Chromebook? Honestly, I think in someway everyone could. It's great for kids, students, travelers, bloggers, and business. I don't think it is suited for web content designers and graphic designers, but short of that I have found many uses for both work and play. For $249, how can you go wrong? I recently sold all my Apple stuff and made the move to Android for mobile (with a Samsung phone and Asus tablet) and a  Windows 8 touch PC.

It starts up quickly, is extremely light and portable, runs cool, and boasts incredible battery life (I've been getting 5-6 hours with a full charge).

Most everything is run in the Chrome browser, with the Google equivalent of the Office suite and Gmail running offline. Reliance on a wireless internet connection has been widely criticized as a drawback, but with how widespread free wifi and personal hotspots have become, I don't personally have an issue with that.If you're considering the Chromebook, it's important to understand that it is not intended to be a replacement for a full-size laptop (and certainly not a desktop computer). It's $250, and that's just not its purpose. I'm an art student who also works part-time in web development, frequently running Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Dreamweaver, so for all intents and purposes I'd be considered a \"power user.\" I do not use the Chromebook for those tasks.

I wanted a laptop that I could easily carry around to class or friend's rooms for writing reports or facebook browsing or simply having the resource of the internet available while doing homework (wolframalpha and chegg, to name a few). The Chromebook excels in everything I have asked of it. It boots instantly, the battery lasts longer than I ever need of it, it charges very fast (about 2 hours), and removes all the painful experiences related to other computers. When it is in my backpack it feels as if not even there. My other laptop has a 500gb drive, so I was at first skeptical about such a downgrade. But you really don't need much space and I doubt I'll ever bring this one to its full 16 gigs. I bought it at best buy for 250 and it was worth it in every way. I would not use it as one's only computer, but it is the perfect companion to a desktop or larger, less portable laptop.

While this machine is limited in some ways (no external applications) it is truly the best \"2nd device\" you could ask for. What I mean is that if you already have a home computer that can do everything, this is the perfect, inexpensive device that can do *almost* everything.The flash problems mentioned by others are valid, and I am hoping for a fix in the near future so that I can use several websites (Adobe Story, Netflix, and some flash games as well). This is the main reason why my review is only four stars instead of five. (EDIT: Netflix is now fixed, and Adobe Story is working much, much better.)With the Chrome extension \"Chrome Remote Desktop\" you can connect your Chromebook to a your home computer and actually run most, if not all of the websites and programs you'd need to remotely. I use my Chromebook to access games and programs that I cannot install directly on the Chromebook, and it's a great, useful workaround for those people who absolutely have to have a specific program or flash website available to them.The machine is snappy and quick, and the keyboard is one of the best you'll find on any laptop. The keys are spread decently far apart and have good travel and a satisfying, yet un-annoying 'click' every time they are pressed. The trackpad isn't 100% perfect, but it is close. Two-fingered scrolling works like a charm, but there are occasions when the cursor will move too fast or too slow, which is probably more of a computational power problem than it is an actual problem with the cursor.For a web-browsing, email sending, blog writing, document producing machine, the Chromebook blows all of the competition away. I know there are many who feel it should have a touch screen, and I'm sure future models of it will indeed feature that, but for right now I'd rather pay $250 for a device that just works and does the basics, than paying $400 for a similar device that I can put my fingers on.If you're a writer or just do a lot of writing you're not going to be happy using something like an iPad with a keyboard. Trust me on this, as I have tried. Stop debating and weighing the pros and cons and buy a Chromebook right now. This little device is perfect, the battery life is outstanding (it's rated at six and a half hours, but I average closer to seven and a half right now), and I use it as a cookbook (with Evernote), a word processor, a web browser, and a device that I can quickly send an email on, without being annoyed with a finnicky touch screen on my phone.One of the best features of this device that I haven't mentioned yet is the quick load and wake times. I close the device when I'm done, walk away, then when I want to use it again I flip the lid and it's just there, ready and waiting for me. I love having access to the search button at my fingertips, too, as the keyboard button makes asking Google questions so much easier.Finally, the extensions and applications in the Chrome Store really do make this device perfect. I have Evernote web clipper, Clearly, Google Mail Checker, Google Voice Extension, Google Calendar Extension and many, many more that just give me all the information and shortcuts I need, all on one screen. This really is an amazing device, and when set up correctly it can and will replace your home PC for 99% of your computing needs.Buy one now.

At my school there is an emphasis on technology, and I find that it is very convenient to have a laptop during class for researching things, typing notes, and working on projects. Before buying this Chromebook I had been using an iPad 2 with a keyboard. It was nice, but there were some limitations to the amount of things that I could do and the bluetooth keyboard could be a hassle sometimes. It was time to look for something that offered improved productivity and a more convenient keyboard.I did a lot of research on laptops before deciding to but this Chromebook. I looked at more high-end laptops (Asus Zenbook, MacBook Air) which range from $600 - $1,000, but ultimately the Chromebook was the best option. Google Drive has an awesome suite of office products that are comprehensive and offer unique capabilities. Google Docs is the Word-like program that offers most of the capabilities of Word and also allows users to collaborate with other users. However, I have found that incorporating pictures into documents can be a hassle. In my biology class, we have to use a STATs program called ANOVA and there is a Google script for Spreadsheets which allows you to use the program. There is really no end to the convenience that Google Drive offers.The Chromebook itself is very portable. It is extremely thin and light, as well as well built. It is made out of plastic, but it still feels sturdy. The keyboard is EXCELLENT and may be the best the type I've ever typed on. There is no keyboard flex which might be expected from an inexpensive laptop. The screen is just bright enough, the camera is adequate, and the the battery is beyond what is listed or expected. The ARM processor that this machine is equipped with is super zippy and does not  get hot and rarely freezes. The Chromebook boots up in apt. 9 seconds, and wakes up from sleep immediately.There is two things you should know before buying this. There is very little you can do on this without and internet connection and printing can be complicated. You can create documents and edited synced documents offline, but you cannot get to your Evernote or unsynced Google Docs offline. Printing only works through Google Cloud Print, which requires you have a Cloud Print ready printer or a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer that is connected to a printer to print. Research more about Cloud Print before you buy this.Everything about this device is awesome and you should definitely consider this when wanting to purchase a ultraportable, long lasting, and fast device.", "Date": "June 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Well-built, simple, and fun to use", "Author": "JP Gaubier", "ReviewID": "RXL62W7I8Y5W4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little computer is what I've wanted in a PC for years: fast, fanless, quiet, and compact.

There has been a bit of a learning curve with this device. There are a number of things you cannot do with this machine that takes some adaptation on the part of the user. I'll cover those in this review.Primarily, my computing uses are: news, shopping, email, internet radio, and limited TV watching (podcast). I do not have cable-tv or satellite. So my computer is my cable-TV using Amazon Prime and other online services. I use itunes for lots of my media consumption, using the chromebook means there is no itunes, which caused a real turmoil trying to figure out how to get the same programs and keep track of what has and hasn't been watched. The substitute has been using Google Reader and subscribing to RSS feeds for the podcasts I used itunes for.I only play a couple games, one of those is a total no-go on the chromebook, which was something I knew before I purchased it.Here's what I have come up with so far about using the samsung 11.6\" $250 machine:Pros: battery life (5-6 hrs), small size and weight (similar to macbook air) ease of use - fast to start-up (mine takes about 8 seconds), Chrome is very similar to Firefox (even can add extensions like the ones I use on the imac)(ad blocker, ghostery, lastpass, downloaders,etc.) will play most media stored in the chromebook or on google drive, will support a generic wired usb mouse, decent wifi performance, screen resolution is decent but not hi-def, audio is acceptable, battery charge rate is decent, I think the unit is fairly protected against viruses but being chained to google makes you totally spied upon by our service providing overlords.Cons: Confusing settings menus (scattered here and there), lack of uniformity on using right click for some functions and in some places but not others, lack of settings (no control panels) for standard features on laptops (ex: brightness control), ear phone jack is stiff and hard to use, SD card slot leaves part of the card sticking out the side, 100gb free google drive will not authorize for some strange reason (i tried re-setting the computer back to factory settings and trying three times - same results - no response from clicking on the button to redeem the offer), waking up from sleep is sometimes a total fail requiring a re-boot, no way I can see to block obnoxious flash ads (aside from blocking the domain in your router)I'll update it after a month or so, but as of now I have no buyers remorse.FOLLOW-UP:I've had my Chromebook for almost two months now, it gets used a lot. It is not my number one choice but here are some thoughts after using it for a while:1. the biggest problem for me with this device is the lack of software that functions like Itunes. I am a cord cutter, so my source for TV and news is the internet and mostly on itunes podcasts. If you know of a way to duplicate this service please let me know. I have tried using google RSS news-reader but it is very awkward and clumsy.2. my biggest dislike is with the small screen size.3. When I need quick access to something like amazon or email and I have to turn on a computer, the fast start-up time for the chromebook is reason #1 why I use it over my windows-7 based laptop.4. I have not met anyone anywhere that has heard of Chrome OS.5. The dependence on wifi so far has not been an issue. Making the cloud storage work and understanding what I can and cannot put there is reason #1 why I doubt I would take this on a vacation with me since I need to move images/video from the camera to storage.6. The OS needs something like a control panel screen that does not configure the Chrome browser but just the hardware. I would like to see more things settable. (time-out, btry saver modes, privacy, auto-erase my browsing history, auto-erase my downloads history, etc.)7. the metal trim around the LCD display feels loose-ish and flimsy. The flat surface area on either side of the trackpad feels flimsy and sometimes creaks when my hands rest there.8. The SD card slot should allow the card to be fully inserted, leaving almost half the card sticking out is asking for a broken card/slot.9. The battery life is great, charging is fast and easy.10. Sound and images are fine.11. You know what would really be the ideal chromebook? Make this a 17 inch display with built-in wifi/3G/4G service, non-contract (virgin mobile), allowing tethering, and a micro SD card slot for added memory and this machine would be a run-away hit.2/3/13 Just got back from a trip by plane. On many previous trips I took my macbook air (MBA). I was always worried about it coming up missing after going through airport security (the thieves in the TSA). The Chromebook is much less of a target. One of the things I do with a laptop on trips is to download pictures and videos from my cameras from the card to an external USB hard drive. Just like the MBA, the chromebook worked flawlessly for this. Only snag was if I tried to watch a large video file, hi-res, it could not display the video. I also found out that moving files from one folder to another on an SD card is nearly impossible with this OS. I did make it work with a very time consuming copy and paste technique but moving them from the SD card to the USB drive was simply drag and drop.All in all, it performed well and I feel much better about bringing it through 'security theater' than I do with the MBA that is almost $1k more!I also tried using the chromebook with a large LCD tv and it looked fine.

I'm still using the old Chromebook (Samsung S5) at my house and I leave the new S3 ARM Chromebook at my girlfriend's house.  Since Chrome is cloud based and syncs so well I go between the two Chromebooks seamlessly.  The Chromebook S3 is faster than my old S5, and the built in speakers are much improved over the weak ones on the S5.While I'm not using the new S3 ARM Chromebook her 8 year old uses it (with supervision) for homework and games.  We set him up a Google account, and he knows how to sign me out and sign himself in. He operates the touch pad better than I can.  He uses the maximize button (shift-maximize) to go in and out of full screen for games.  He plugs it into the charger when he's done. It's kid proof.  No accidental erase of my data since Chrome keeps the two accounts totally separate. My girlfriend and I watch the Google Chromebook commercials that say Chromebook is \"The computer for the whole Family\" and we totally agree. A Chromebook is not for everyone, but it's good for a lot people young and old.I've had 20 gig of Google Storage (Drive) for over 2 years.  First time I opened Google Drive on the S3 it prompted me and took me through adding the 100gig (free for 2 years).  Drive and the Doc office applications are all I use now.  I've not used Word or Excel since I got the 1st Chromebook (I have Office 2007 on Windows).  I print from the Chromebook using Google Cloud print.I use Chrome for my browser of choice on Window which allows me to use Chrome Remote Desktop (by Google) to access and control my Windows PC from my Chromebook (S3 or S5) when needed. That is really handy.  I use the Chromebook's SSH terminal (CTRL-ALT-T) to access Linux systems instead using Putty (on windows).I can't do everything on a Chromebook and still need Windows a tiny bit.

I use it at home where I have wifi and it performs exceptionally.GOOD SIDE: SUPERFAST startup/shut down.SUPERFAST wifi connectionBattery last a long time.  I charge it in the morning and get 7 or more hours out of a charge before I have to plug it in.Internet works flawless.Video quality isnt AWSOME but it is pretty good.The bottom gets warm, but not hot at allKeyboard is slightly different from a standard keyboard, but works well.BAD SIDE:If you close the lid, it goes to sleep and looses internet.  Currently there is no way to disable this, but from what I have read in the forums, it is being worked on.There are a few things missing from the keyboard that you are used to having on a regular keyboard, so learning the shortcuts can be time consuming, but not really a big issueThe touchpad gets a little getting used to.  Remember, this is not a windows computer, so expect a learning curve.So far after a week of using the Samsung Chromebook, I don't have any real complaints.  For what I use it for it works fantastic.  If you are looking for a high performance laptop, this is not for you.  If you are a gamer, this is not for you.  If you surf the web all day and spend alot of time on social media, this IS FOR YOU.Please keep in mind THIS IS NOT WINDOWS.  There will be a learning curve to using this.  Once you get the hang of it, it is great.  So Far I LOVE IT!!!UPDATE:I have been using this for about 2 weeks now as my main computer and so far it still works fantastic.  The battery is amazing.  I charge it at night and it lasts pretty much most of the day.  Its lightweight so it travels so easy between rooms.  As I have seen on  many other reviews, it does loose its internet connection when you close the lid, but once you open it up it only takes about 5-6 seconds to reconnect to wifi.

I practically hunted through these reviews and winced whenever a bad review here and there came up. In the end I bought it since it was in my price range and it seems good. It's smaller than my previous laptop (approx. 15 inch) and really light. Now I am not a GAMER so if you guys are...don't buy it. All I do on my laptop is typed documents, watch videos, surf the net and read. If I wanted to game, I'd borrow my brother's PS3 or something. Anyway as you can see, its perfect for someone who simply does simple stuff. However if you're expecting the usual windows operating system and can't stand change. Don't buy this laptop.This laptop is VERY different. It runs on a different operating system (Chrome OS), you cannot download any programs like microsoft office, photoshop and such. Even the touch pad is different...I guess I am used to my right-click action but this is not a issue to me. Oh yes and if you're a person who is constantly around wifi, that's great. To those who aren't, majority of the extensions and such requires wifi. There are, however, offline packages such as the Google Docs and such so don't worry. Also this laptop does NOT have a CD drive so don't go and buy this laptop blindly if you want a CD drive.Now I'll just throw it in here. I am from Belize (friends brought it down for me). Reason why I say this is because I realize some of the apps don't work depending on your region. For example Google Play Movies, Google Play Music etc. Also if you are the type of people who constantly goes online to video chat with your friends/family the options are limited. Oovoo and Skype doesn't work, the Google Hangout(I believe is the name) I am unsure if it works or not since my Google+ profile got suspended so I'll check back. Now let's review back kids!DON'T buy this if you...are used to Windows Operating System (and/or can't stand change)needs CD Driveloved to play high quality gamesRequires/uses photoshop, Ms Office or any programs.USes other browsers. This is CHROME only zone. Firefox is not allowedUse Oovoo/skype to VC. (Tinychat works fine tho)Don't have much access to wifi (unless you already set up the offline apps)This laptop is different. If you are the type who are already used to the Windows Operating System, MS Office, skype, FireFox, and other stuff. This laptops is not for you.It's a Google product (hence the whole CHROME in chromebook)which uses chrome browser, google apps, and such. And to those who bought it and complained about it because \"Google is trying to trap you\", now if you get to say that then I get to say this \"Apple is trying to trap me by forcing me to use only their programs!! Safari! iTunes! iBooks! Ohmagosh!!!\" You see how ridiculous that sounds? I mean I reread that and I want to punch myself in the face. So do remember this...Read, research, compare then buy. I have read through different reviews (Good and bad), went to other websites, read up through forums, and then read the information provided above. By the time I was finished I understood that I CANNOT download programs that I used before, that I would have to use apps from Google, that if I had no wifi, this laptop cannot do much except use the offline apps. In fact I even used the Customer Q&A; to ask what I didn't have the answers for(http://www.amazon.com/there-available-still-usable-documents/forum/Fx2X6TNCJ239Z9U/Tx2R8IV8I6C02WF/1?_encoding=UTF8&asin;=B009LL9VDG)I pretty much read through everything in the Q&A...most; of the times I would see the same question over and over, does it have a CD drive? Gosh people...look through the questions. So yes it takes hours, but at least I understood what I was getting. To be honest it was a total surprise to me that Oovoo and skype doesn't work but easily I switched to tinychat. But I guess it works because you don't necessarily download it like oovoo or skype.Anyway thank you for reading this dreadful review. Also be nice and don't attack me by saying \"She works for the Devil(google)!!!!

Hatos", "ReviewID": "R15EQPZSC8OEPT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There is a good reason why near 3 thousand people left review for the Samsung Chromebook and most agreed it is a darn good machine for the price.  If I may let me say a few words too about not specifically the hardware, but rather why I decided to buy Samsung Chromebook and why now. Many of you may agree, right now it is a terrible time to buy any kind of PC including notebooks.  Haswell on the way, revision of Windows 8 at the cornel, SSD mounted ultrabooks on the rise that cost thousand or more and of course the buzz around Chrome OS uncertain with its Packaged Apps direction.  So, why did I decide to buy a Chromebook and picked Samsung? For the Chromebook a single, most darn good reason is security. I am still using Windows XP and I prefer to use free programs to do things, like You Tube downloader, file type converter, media player and so on. However these freebies often saturated with spywares and no matter how well I try to protect my computer, soon or later I'll get hit. Before I bought my Samsung Chromebook my Google account was nearly hijacked. You can understand I really don't want to share my stuff with just anybody. The solution is a Chromebook. It is near impossible to get infected, so being secure is exactly what I wanted. As far as why I picked Samsung is pretty obvious.  Best keyboard, has all the connectivity, long battery life, light weight and probably the best is it has no moving parts, not even a fan and yes, of course the price. If you are looking for a Chromebook look no further. You may have to buy another Chromebook 6 month later, but right now is a very good if not the best choice you have. So there you go.Updated: 10/23/13Having a wireless network at home allow me to use my Chromebook anywhere around the house. It is very handy and spoiled me to that point I hardly use my PC anymore. Using the Chromebook is joyful simple. Just open it and there you go, continue where you have left. Same thing for putting aside. Just close it and it is done.I watch lots of YouTube videos. At night after I went to bed I pick for example a stand-up comedy and let myself fall asleep. When the video finish  the Chromebook puts itself into sleep mode too. My goal is to turn the Chromebook into an eBook reader, perhaps having a timer with it.The big drawback of course is it doesn't run Skype. I know there is Google's Hangouts, but I am sorry the World at this moment running on Skype and Google should acknowledge that and should do everything to work it out with Microsoft to make Skype running on Chromebook. At this moment nothing could boost Chromebook sales better than that.Updated: 3/10/14It is almost 6 months that I have purchased this product and I like it more than eve. Since my purchase many more new Chromebooks came out, but I still would buy Samsung. For one reason is its fan-less design. Sure the new Intel's Haswell chip seems to be faster, like Acer C720 series using it, but it has fan, which means you have to careful not plug the went hole. This one you don't have to worry about that, using it  in the bad, or placing the unit over something soft material, like comforter or pillow is no problem. I just like that freedom. Besides, speed is never was an issue for me.My Chromebook working for me many ways. When I am sleeping it download files, like .avi files.  When I am watching TV and I want to find out where Sochi is I just reach for my Chromebook and map it. If need a word or some kind of references, again I just rich for my Chromebook. Social network, emails, reading online magazines, post photos and many other activities my Chromebook is beside me. I also purchased a Chromecast. One of my best spent money. It is working wonderfully with my Chromebook and watching for example YouTube on the TV is a surprisingly different and very enjoyable experience. And finally don't think about Chromebook as a PC or a full-fledged laptop replacement, because it is not or at least not yet, but rather a media device that do a lot and for some  perhaps it does enough that you don't need any other computer.", "Date": "September 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "For exactly what it is", "Author": "A.

Basically just normal work that doesn't require me to be chained to my desktop computer constantly.  I purchased an iPad Mini for these tasks but it's not functional enough (especially when it comes to typing anything) and it isn't great for multitasking.  This device fulfills all of these roles perfectly.  The Chromebook boots super fast, is very lightweight, is responsive for the most part, and looks really nice. The design is Apple-esque without the premium price tag.  Google's version of Microsoft Office has been more than capable of handling my assignments.My complaints are that the build could be a little sturdier (it looks like a Mac but doesn't have that level of design quality) especially in regards to the power and USB outlets, which seem a little flimsy and prone to accidental damage.  I definitely found it worthwhile to invest in the Square Trade accidental damage warranty.  I'm not very fond of the trackpad as it can be sluggish and uncomfortable to use.  I use a small USB mouse instead. The Chromebook can also get a little bogged down by too many applications running at once.  A higher screen resolution wouldn't hurt but I'm not complaining when the computer is this affordable.I've really come to appreciate cloud computing after using this device and agree that it is the way of the future.  Most computer owners (except for PC gamers, movie enthusiasts and photo or video editors) don't really need tons of physical storage space and can instead make great use of the ease and accessibility of cloud storage.  I can access all of my documents and files on Google Drive and all of my music on Google Play from any computer, phone, or tablet.

I have been using it for a while now and thought I would share my thoughts on the computer and, more importantly, the Chrome OS. I'm a professor, so I will say a bit on the usefulness of the Chromebook in the academic setting.There are a variety of Chromebooks ranging from the $200 \"netbook\" models to the $1500 Pixel. I have the $249 Samsung Chromebook and consider it to be the optimal Chromebook at this time, in terms of price, weight and capabilities.In terms of the hardware, this Chromebook is quite adequate for the Chrome OS. It has 2 GB of RAM, 16 GB of eMMC storage, a 1.7 GHz Exynos 5000 Series processor,and  a screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels.  Subjectively, the screen is sharp and handles color well. The sound is what one would expect from such a device-less than awesome, but not awful. For those concerned about size and weight, it weighs 2.4 pounds and measures 10.4 X 8.09 X .69 (inches). For ports and slots, it has 1 USB 2.0 port, 1 USB 3.0 Port, an HDMI port, a headset port and a SD card slot. With the right HDMI to VGA adapter, it can output to a VGA monitor or projector-be sure the adapter works with the Chromebook before buying it, though. While the USB ports allow the user to plug in any USB device, the Chrome OS has extremely limited support for devices. As a general rule, if a device requires you to install a driver then it will not work with Chrome OS. Fortunately, USB storage devices work fine. This laptop also has wi-fi (which is essential) and Bluetooth. It has, of course, a webcam.My subjective assessment is that the hardware is reasonably matched to the price. The keyboard is not exceptional but is reasonably comfortable to use. I am not a big fan of trackpads and the trackpad on the laptop did nothing to change my mind.  Fortunately, many wireless Bluetooth mice work with it (but not all). I do like the laptops  size and weight-I can easily put it in my backpack and carry it around all day.What makes a Chromebook a Chromebook is, of course, the Chrome OS. Roughly put the Chrome OS is essentially a browser operating system: almost everything you do, you do in the Chrome browser. As such, if you want to get a very good idea what using a Chromebook is like, fire up Chrome and try to do what you want to do.There are some advantages to the Chrome OS. First, it is a lightweight OS and hence it boots fast. Second, it is a fairly simple OS and hence has somewhat fewer problems than more robust operating systems like Windows, Mac and full Linux systems.  You set up your Chromebook in seconds: turn it on, log in to your Google account and you are ready. This is in contrast with the time and effort it takes to get a Mac or Windows laptop up and running. Third, Google handles all the updates and as long as you connect to the internet you will have the latest version of the OS. There is, for the most part, no messing around with updating. Fourth, the Chrome OS is obviously integrated with Google's software. When I got my Chromebook, I also got two years of 100 GB of storage on GoogleDrive, which is supposed to be worth $120. If you use GoogleDrive, you can look at a Chromebook as a $130 laptop with the GoogleDrive subscription. Looked at that way, it is an excellent deal. Fifth, there are many good apps available for Chrome ranging from word processing apps to games.There are also some major disadvantages to the Chrome OS. First, being a minimalist and simple OS it provides little to no support for devices. As mentioned above, while it has USB ports, most devices will not have drivers and hence will not work. Storage devices are, however, the exception. Second, printing from Chrome OS requires either a printer that works with Cloud Print or having another computer set up to handle the printing connection. Third, with the exception of the offline apps available at the Chrome Store, the user cannot install software in Chrome. While the Chrome OS obviously cannot run Windows and Mac software, the limited number of truly useful or good offline apps makes being offline a problem. Fortunately, Google's core software (such as Google Docs) works offline so you can still edit and create documents. However, you will only have access to your local files when offline. One thing that obviously mitigates the offline issue is that cloud computing is almost now the rule rather than the exception. However, when considering a Chromebook you will want to consider your software needs. To see if Chrome OS will be adequate offline, fire up Chrome and disconnect your PC from the internet (be sure to set up your Google drive so you can work offline).While the Chrome OS has rather serious limitations, as long as they are taken into account a Chromebook can be very useful. In my case, I use my Chromebook in two main roles. The first is as my \"web\" laptop. Since Chrome OS is essentially a browser, I can do all my web activities, such as blogging and email  with the laptop. Since it boots almost instantly, has a great battery life and is light I find it ideal for when I need to do something online quickly or want to be away from my desktop (like outside in the sun).The second role  is as my academic laptop. While I do create most of my content in Word, PowerPoint, Respondus, Acrobat and Illustrator, most of my teaching involves Blackboard  and email. Blackboard works fine with the Chromebook, so I can edit/create exams, check on student grades, view assignments and so on. Obviously, web-based email also works fine on a Chromebook. I also use it at meetings-I can take notes using Google Docs or Evernote (or pretend to do so). Previously I used a first generation iPad for that, but rather prefer the Chromebook's keyboard. With the iPad I had to bring a Bluetooth keyboard and poke at the screen with my finger. The Chromebook weighs about the same as the iPad plus keyboard and word processing is much easier on the Chromebook-at least for me,  but I grew up using a typewriter rather than texting.I think students would find this Chromebook a good choice. First, while it is not as sexy-cool as an iPad, it costs half the price of the basic iPad and comes with a keyboard. Second, for students who do not need specialized software it has what they will need: the ability to write papers, do email and so on. Since many professors use Blackboard these days, the poor handling of printing will generally not be an issue.  Also, most campuses have wireless and hence being offline will not be an issue.  Third, it is light and small which makes it easy to carry about between classes. Fourth, its connection to Google Drive means that files will be generally safe from computer issues (or the laptop being stolen). On the downside, this could rob a student of many of the usual excuses involving computers and work that has not been done.Overall, I would recommend the Samsung Chromebook-but be sure to keep in mind its limitations. If you are looking for a low-cost \"web\" laptop, it is hard to beat. If you need a robust computer to run traditional programs, you'll need to go with a Mac, Linux or Windows laptop.", "Date": "July 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far, so good!", "Author": "Julie \"Green Chick\"", "ReviewID": "RXG62ICWKFG18", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I ordered this on Monday after watching a lot of video reviews and reading a lot about it, so I knew what to expect.

My Toshiba laptop would have NEVER made it this long without a charge.- Super fast setup.- Ridiculously fast boot time. Wow, it's amazing!- Quiet! Love how quiet it is. No noisy fan.- Specialized buttons. I haven't gotten to use all of them, but I love having a key for mute and volume. My Asus laptop didn't have this, which was really annoying.- Great trackpad. I'm normally an external mouse kind of person, but this is a trackpad I can actually use. It's nice and responsive, and I love how you can click anywhere on it, rather than having to click an actual button.- Light! I stupidly bought a 17\" screen laptop for college. I never took it to school because it killed my back, adding about 6 pounds to my backpack. This thing is amazingly light and is going to save me a million times over.Cons:- I hate the power jack/power cord. It's so tiny and wee. I have power jack issues on almost every piece of technology I buy, for some reason, even though I'm really careful. I'm nervous about this one. Luckily, the fact that the charge lasts so long might mean I spend a lot less time with it plugged in, negating the wear on it that my other laptops end up having from being constantly charging.- I had a lot of trouble syncing Chrome from my other computer. I still haven't quite sorted it out, as nearly everything synced but my bookmarks, but I'm dealing with it. My help email from Chrome said that I must be using an old version of a device but...I just bought this today so I hope it's not an old version!-It's warmer on the bottom than I expected based on reviews. It's definitely cooler than my laptop, so I'm not sure that it's fair to list this as a con, but after all the hype about how cool it was, I was expecting miracles I guess. So not really much of a con, just something to let people know...it's not AS cool on the bottom as they say.Many of the complaints I read other people having weren't things I was concerned about. No delete button? I'm okay with that. No Skype? Totally cool with that, I've never Skyped and don't plan to. No Caps lock? Sweet. I was always accidentally hitting that without needing it, because how often do I really need to type in all caps? No page up/page down? Meh. I used it occasionally, but it's not a concern for me. I do agree with a commenter I saw who said this thing needs a .com button. YES! All computers should have that nowadays, I don't know why they don't.I'm also cool with not having an actual operating system. I bought this for college, and I like Google Docs. I love not worrying that I idiotically forgot to hit save, or that my computer crashed and my paper died. Google Docs is great for that. Screen quality is just fine for me. I've seen some complaints about viewing angle, but I guess my other computers must have sucked, too, because I always had to tilt them just right to see what I was watching. Same with this.This is DEFINITELY worth the $249 I paid for it. I've heard it called a glorified tablet with a keypad...I guess. So far I don't feel like that. It really feels like a laptop and I keep waiting to run into the limitations of it.I always kind of roll my eyes at the people I see on campus pulling out their iPad, and their iPad stand, and their iPad keyboard, and spending 5 minutes getting it all set up and positioned on their desk...good grief, if you are going to do all that get a laptop! Better yet, get this. So much cheaper and easier to manage, even if it isn't as flashy or name-brandy.", "Date": "July 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "When you don't expect it...", "Author": "Jure \u0160", "ReviewID": "R3M3INXYKXFUK7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I decided to buy a Chromebook, and even though each and every one of them was special in a way, I decided to go with Samsung Series 3. Light, elegant, long battery life, no vent, no noise, but slower performance.So, I'll dive right in -Build quality it amazing - if you consider the price, of course. In my experience, many laptops in the 400-500 GBP price range aren't build as well. I love the keyboard, I can really type comfortably and accurately. Touch pad is another thing that surprised me - accurate, responsive and a two/three fingers gestures are great - with their help, you can browse really fast. If I would own a MacBook, I would probably find more flaws with a build quality, but then again, the price is awkwardly different. Anyways, amazing quality for the price, in my opinion.Screen is okay, it's quite bright, but the viewing angles could be better. Colors are okay, but a little washed-out from time to time.I knew that this is not the fastest Chromebook out there, it's supposed to be one of the slowest. That's way I was probably surprised when everything worked really well. I can open many tabs at once without a problem, the only thing are YouTube HD videos - if I run them in in the background, they may stop for a second or two if I open a few pages that takes long to load. Otherwisem, it's really great for the social, news, gaming, ... sites. You can browse those with ease, it really surprised me, since, like I said, I didn't expect much.The speakers are awesome for the price, another thing that surprised me. Very loud, the sound quality may not be among the best, but it's still a nice touch to have a loud speakers on a cheap device like this. You won't need an addition speakers if you want to watch a movie in bed or listen to music while browsing, that's for sure. :-)Battery life is also great - I get around 6-7 hours with normal usage - YouTube, browsing, music, some web-games... and what also surprised me - it doesn't take much time to be fully-charged again. Great!Oh, and Chrome OS is awesome! If you know how the things work and what to expect, you can dive right in. It's simple, easy to learn and man, it's fast. Coming from a Windows machine, I just couldn't believe how fast everything works. Even on a budget machine like this.Anyways, that's as far as I could get in a few days. I really love this device, probably because I didn't expect much and I got plenty. I instantly fell in love with it, Chrome OS is such an amazing system. Don't get me wrong, the are flaws, on the device and the OS, but it's just so easy to look past them because of the low price. And it will just get better from here.

We had contemplated a tablet, because she has an iPhone and that would have been pretty much the same thing, but the price tag for even an iPad mini was way more that what she was wanting to spend! We went to BestBuy and played around with a few computers, but even those were upwards of $400 which she still wasn't quite comfortable with because she wasn't sure she'd use it enough to justify the price, so we left empty handed. Then I remembered hearing good things about the Chromebook, so I looked it up here on Amazon, showed her some pictures and explained the concept, and she was willing to try it out. We ordered it on Monday and it arrived today-- I literally opened the box, flipped open the lid of the Chromebook and it powered up instantly. I was very impressed! It prompted for language, and then to connect to a wireless network, and for a gmail address which my mom doesn't have (she still uses AOL! haha) so I made her a gmail address that's the same as her AOL SN-- I noticed there was also an option to \"browse as guest\" if someone didn't have a gMail account. I was on the internet setting up bookmarks for her facebook and amazon in literally 2 minutes after opening the box! If you're going to be doing extensive work I would say you will probably need something more powerful-- but for someone like my mom who doesn't need all the bells and whistles, just a nice machine to browse the internet and check e-mails, facebook, etc with a REAL keyboard-- the Chromebook is awesome!!! I have a Dell Inspiron Notebook that's about 4 years old, and after using this Chromebook I think I might get one too. It feels a lot like a macbook in a way, but at 1/10 of the price at least!

During this review, if I call out a limitation, remember... you only paid $250.Build:  Excellent and I believe it can survive the road.Battery life:  Better then average, 5-6 hours under pretty heavy realistic usage, I wear out before it does. Recharges fairly quickly.Display:  Clean and bright enough.  Pages display fairly quickly.Keyboard:  Intuitive for the Internet, keys well spaced with good feedback though I won't be writing any novels on it.Bluetooth:  Targus is a household name in portable computing.  My Targus laptop mouse is not compatible with the Chromebook BT. Go figure???  Ordering a Samsung mouse to use with a Samsung Chromebook... fingers are crossed.  Phone and stereo headsets... few if any compatible and you will have to wait for more Bluetooth profiles from Goog if ever to resolve.  If you are Bluetooth intensive... do not buy, you will be disappointed.Ports:  One USB 2.0 and one 3.0. My 2.O hub allows expansion so no gripes. No Ethernet jack.  Card reader works well and there is a cell sim port too.HDMI:  Connected to my HD Phillips hotel room TV in \"native\" resolution with no issues.  Watched a show on Netflix with no problem on a less then stellar hotel WiFi setup. I enjoyed the show, no lag or dropped frames or sound out of sync.  So pretty good for $ 250.Wireless:  Connected every time so far.USB drives and DVD:  External hard drives are supported and seen through the file manager.  External DVDs... don't go there-not supported.  IMO Google needs to fix this because we still own movies and music on CD and DVD that we paid good $ for and I don't have all day to rip them to supported formats for transferring to thumb drives.Printing:  Another thing high on the list to fix.  Dear Google: Even grandma wants to print her 'net recipes on a local printer; and she doesn't have the $ to purchase a new one that is compatible with Google Cloud print.  What were you thinking? At least give us what most Linux builds have.In conclusion:  I really want to take this thing back and spend the extra 500 or 600 dollars to get something that I will do the exact same thing on 90% of the time but never notice any real difference.

While I'm sure the dulled brightness serves a purpose in regards to battery and the overall price of the product, it is simply an aspect that I could not overcome.  The trackpad is a multi-touch, useful touchpad.. when it works.  I noticed that my interactions with it were choppy, and I got somewhat frustrated.  Once I had the general knack of the Chromebook down, the trackpad had issues keeping up with my swift movements.  Overall, this is a great laptop for first-time computer owners, younger children, or college students who are looking for a computer they can toss into their bag and go.  However, it is not a product that I could see myself using as a sole computer.  The dim screen prevented me from being able to type a paper without getting a headache.

I got it about 10 months ago (just before last Christmas; it was one of the first produced) and have been using it every day since.Pros:* Price point.  Can't beat that.* Weight.  It honestly feels like I'm not carrying anything - I once picked up the neoprene case and almost didn't realize it was empty.* Battery life.  I kid you not, I have gotten 7 hours out of the battery.  That's 7 hours of use, not 7 hours with the monitor off in sleep mode.* Boot speed.  Almost a year in, boot speed is the same as it always was, and it gets me to the login screen in 3 seconds.  Full login in under 10 seconds.* Crash recovery.  When the computer or a window crashes, Chrome reopens everything the way it was.Cons:* The body is made of plastic. This wouldn't be a big deal, but if you pick it up by the palm rest (like most people do) it causes the touchpad to click.  Likewise, if you rest too much weight on your palms, it causes the mouse to click spontaneously.* As an extension of that, the SD card slot has a door on it.  The plastic on it is total crap.  I can't pinpoint any abuse that would cause this, but mine broke off.* Video capabilities.  The computer can't handle youtube videos in high resolution, much less if you load an AVI onto the machine.* Remember, no executable files.  Everyone should know this already, but you can't install programs on this machine.  Just Chrome extensions.* Processor power.  As best I can tell, for tabs containing mild graphics, the machine maxes out around 5-8 tabs.  I think it may have a memory leak as well, as windows left open for over 24 hours have a habit of crashing.Basically, this is a great computer at an unbeatable price, but you need to go into it being aware of its limitations or you will be disappointed.", "Date": "October 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm loving it!", "Author": "Julie H. Rose", "ReviewID": "R12955DRJGS506", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have used an Apple computer of some sort since they came out. My old Macbook was showing the signs of imminent death and so I was planning on buying a MacBook Air. There's no Apple store near me, so I went to a Big Store (where I thought I'd get to try one). Nope. They had iPads and Windows laptops, but no MacBook Airs. I noticed the Chromebook display and checked them out.After looking at the iPads, I was (understandably) not impressed with the screen on the Samsung. Still, I tried it. The keyboard seemed really nice, nicer than the one on my MacBook. The touchpad, though a bit small for my taste, seemed responsive. The fact that it was plastic escaped me until I read a review. Oh, it's \"fake aluminum!\" Well, I don't care. It's a nicely designed machine. But, I didn't buy it then. I went home to research and think about whether I would be happy with using Chrome and no programs.So, I analyzed my computer usage for about a week and made the plunge. At $248, it seemed like a decent risk. After all, I've been spending almost a thousand dollars every three years for the latest Mac (yes, that's how long they've all lasted me). If I wound up using the Chromebook for a short while, or only when I'm out, it wouldn't be the worst thing in the world.I've had the machine for a week now, and I'm thrilled. I love a good deal, and the Chromebook is that. No, it doesn't have a gorgeous screen. It looks kinda grainy (and yes, I know that's not tech talk). However, I have discovered that a matte screen is easier on my eyes, and so I'm glad. The keyboard is indeed very nice; the keys are big, and there's just the right amount of \"bounce\" for my taste. There's some odd spacing issues for some keyboard shortcuts, but I assume I'll get used to them.I could care less that it's plastic. It doesn't have a plastic feel, and it is a very nice design. I wish the keyboard could be backlit when needed, but at this price, I won't quibble.I expected it to just be Chrome, but there's a nice files manager if one plugs in a hard drive or thumb drive. There's enough Google apps to do most jobs I need to do. MS Office online is a bit too \"lite\" for me, but I expect I'll manage. I don't use any specialized software for my work.The only serious complaint I have is that Bluetooth doesn't work on speakers right now. Really? I have to plug them in? That's a serious oversight that Google ought to fix asap.But still, this computer is a great deal, and I'm tickled that I didn't spent much money on it. It seems ridiculous to spend $750 more to get a MacBook Air. That's what I'm comparing this to. This computer is light, stylish, easier than heck to use, doesn't use Windows (thank goodness), and has some really lovely OS touches that took this ex-Mac user less than an hour to figure out.If you're looking for a computer to get online with, to bring on trips, and don't use Photoshop, or CAD/CAM, or any other \"serious\" programs, look no further for your next computer. It'll make you feel smart that you saved so much money. Go out and spent the rest of something totally frivolous. Me? I don't need an aluminum chassis machine. This is a tool for the mind, not an automobile.So, with a few problems, 5 stars (easily)! If the screen was better & Google fixed the Bluetooth issue, I'd give it ten stars. Oh yeah, I can't.

If you looking for a computer to give a teenager or a college kid it's great for that. Transferring between Google Docs and Microsoft Word (or the other programs) is simple, so that's not an excuse to not buy the Chromebook. It takes some time getting used to how everything runs but once you get it it is simple. If you love keyboard shortcuts, the Chromebook is full of them. This machine is versatile and sleek (it really looks like a MacBook Air but is a fraction of the cost). It is very light and portable. It has a good battery life and charges quickly. If you're already using Google Chrome as your browser, doing typical internet things is exactly the same.Things I Do With The Chromebook:-Watch TV/Netflix. Unplug the HDMI cable from your cable box and put it in the Chromebook. You can mirror the screens or use the TV as a second monitor. Anyway, I can stream movies quickly right on to the TV.-Listen to music. I have a two Bluetooth speakers and the Chromebook connects right to them.

It still works perfectly (minus the normal hiccups that would come from having my Chromebook set on the Beta channel. Dev scares me though.)

Prior to this device, I was taking notes in a good, old-fashioned notebook, which was fine... I guess. My note taking in class was goodish, but during second semester my note taking was phenomenal. Using Google Drive, I could organize my notes into specific class topics, as well as certain units and class dates. Not only did this benefit me, but it was much easier to email the notes that I took to other classmates who had missed class than it used to be to lend them my notebook and get it back later that week. Taking notes in Google Drive is life changing even if it were only for one thing: the search function. If I'm supposed to study about the Renaissance in Europe, and certain things about Italy are spread out across the semester, I no longer have to page through my notebook and try to find Italy in my notes. All I need to do is type \"Italy\" into the search bar and it automatically shows me all of my documents that have Italy in them. It's incredible for studying.Schooling aside, this computer is amazing for simply browsing the internet. I spend a lot of my time on the internet (probably more than I should,) and this computer handles everything that I need to do in everyday activity. There used to be a problem with the video playback which caused the computer to be severely bogged down while watching YouTube, but it has been resolved as far as I can tell. This is the beauty of the Chromebook, also; the updates for the device are often so that they fix problems promptly, but they are very unobtrusive. I'm looking at you, Windows.

You just enter your google account and it uploads everything- including bookmarks and saved passwords...it was a little creepy even.-decent sound. I came from a media computer with INCREDIBLE sound, so it was hard to adjust to, but I'm used to it now, and can't complain, it's comparable to my husband's in sound.-price is WONDERFUL. such a bargain. it's sturdy enough for a laptop, portable and light enough to compare with a tablet in portability.-love that it has an HDMI port, it's so nice to be able to hook it up to the tv for better viewing with groups.Cons:-I'm a huge multitasker online, often opening tons of tabs while watching a video. It definitely doesn't like that.-I miss my normal games. solitaire, freecell, where are you? :(-I HATE the apps. I thought it would function more like a tablet in that aspect- that things like pinterest or reddit would open as their own application. nope, they almost all just open in the browser. I don't need a downloaded application to take me to a commonly visited website! so pointless.-why the HECK are the speakers on the BOTTOM of the computer?-I wish there was better...I don't know, categorization of files? I like that windows has \"music\", \"documents\" and \"pictures\" preset, this has no such thing and I had to create it and just save files accordingly. something silly but it bothers me nonetheless.-no disc drive, so no cd/dvd burning, but this was no surprise, I knew what I was getting into.Even though my complaints seem numerous, they're really minor. The only REAL complaint is the lag with lots of things open, but I'm pretty impressed with its functionality for the price.

The unit kept restarting randomly, freezing and crashing for no apparent reason. I troubleshooted the issue and attempted to repair it following the advice of Google Forums, reliable tech web articles and Samsung Support, but none of this resolved the issue. The issues were so severe and frustrating that I considered returning it and not ever buying a Google/Samsung product ever again.My girlfriend recommended returning it for an exchange unit and I followed her advice (thankfully!). When I received the new Chromebook, it performed like a champ! Assuming that the first faulty unit I received was an exception, the Samsung Chromebook is an amazing product!Structurally, the unit is solid, very lightweight and even though it's made of plastic, it looks and feels sleek. The screen is bright and the image detail is great. The keyboard is a delight, the keys are firm and springy and seem to take abuse and fast typing. The trackpad is responsive and the gesture controls are cool.Performance-wise, the unit is amazing! It boots up in seconds (around 8) and the apps/browser runs smooth. There are some noticeable delays in screen renderings when scrolling, some skips on videos when changing tabs and some minor lagging when more apps or tabs are running. You have to remember, this is a $250 unit, so it won't run like a supercomputer. You cannot expect immediate tab switching or super smooth multitasking, but for an obsessive and highly critical guy, the unit works magnificently.Regarding the Google-ish aspects of the computer, this will force you to use Google Docs, Drive and the other Google Apps and this is totally a good thing! This will actually make you use more Google products, so you'll end up discovering new and amazing apps with tons of features.If you have a decent working Windows PC or laptop and are bored/sick of using it, this will be a super smart buy. You can use the Chromebook for everything, and if you ever encounter something that the Chromebook cannot handle, just turn to your old PC/laptop, simple as that!

This thing is only $5.99 via Prime and is the best built charger I have ever purchased.  See my review of it.Main ReviewI bought my Chromebook used in \"Like New\" condition from Amazon Warehouse Deals for $189.  It had a dented and opened box but it appeared to be unused.This review will focus on daily use from a traveling salesman.  I fly once per week and stay 3 nights per week in hotels.  My goal is to have something light, quick to start, easy to use, and fulfill my basic tasks.I unpacked it, plugged in the charger, turned it on, logged into my  Google account, launched Chrome, signed into my wifi, and started surfing.  I did not read anything to get started.I have a 13\" Toshiba laptop, a 10\" Toshiba Thrive Tablet, and Droid 2 cell phone.  This device is rapidly replacing everything but the cell.  Since I use the cell to tether the Chromebook for internet access when needed the are now a pair.I use this to surf, read both gmail and corporate Exchange email, do light spreadsheets, word docs, and even power point in their Google Docs equivalent programs, read Kindle books (which are down loadable), and listen to streamed music and down loaded to the SD card music.  I can even stream Amazon Prime and Netflix.  I have also accessed my corporate reports on a COGNOS system.I have paired it via bluetooth with a mouse and keyboard and hooked it to my 50\" plasma tv and played Angry Birds.  I also opened some web pages, printed them via Google Cloud Print, and downloaded them to read later.This by far the best technology buy I have ever made.hint: use \"swap enable\" for better performance, make sure download some apps, books, and games for offline use.I will update periodically as I try it over a range uses , apps, and settings,May 22:  Two days on the road:  This thing is light and thin which makes it easy to carry.  Used it on a 2 hour flight with no wifi and read a downloaded book and worked on a letter and a spreadsheet.  Loved the way it fires up in about 30 seconds.  Logged onto hotel wifi and streamed Amazon and Netflix with no problems.  Added some more apps and downloaded Angry Birds for offline play.  Have not found a way to store music internally so I am buying a micro usb card (the kind that barely protrude from the slot).  Next thing up is to figure out how to download some email for offline use and trying out Office 365.  I went two days of light use never turning it off and I still have 30% battery.May 30:  Duh, downloaded music into Google Play Music for offline listening.  It is very basic but good enough for the very little time I am not streaming Slacker.  I am finding mixed reviews on using 365 on a Chromebook so for now I am learning to live with Google Docs and use my Win8 laptop for just very intense spreadsheets.June 11:  Office 365 can only be used online and not installed on a Chromebook.  Office Apps by Microsoft is free if you have Microsoft Skydrive.  It is ran online but it is real Office programs with all the functionality most users will need.  I would not recommend Google docs for document creation but it is fine for light editing. So I now use my Win 7 laptop, anchored in my office, for MS Office document creation, use Google Docs offline if I must edit while away from wifi which is very rare, and use Office Apps while on the road with wifi.  Which means the Chrome is still my road device of choice.  The instant on and small form factor make it irresistible.Wifi/Bluetooth tethering via my droid is working great so I almost never am without web access.Durability is fine.

They have both a Linux based Kernel (roughly the word for core software engine) but Android has many Java based elements (one of the reasons why the 'controllers'(Sun Microsystems) of Java sewed Google.  So Android apps need some adjustment to run in the Google Chrome OS environment, which is a completely browser based OS with its roots in Linux.  It would be easier to simply use Android (have access to all the apps) or the other, and there have been rumors that they merge (unlikely but possible?!).  There is good reason for Google to have Chrome OS to compete with Windows, so who knows.  So when I said it's a tablet with a keyboard (see review below), it really is kind of its own thing.  It would be nice if it was a tablet with a keyboard (Android apps 100% no issue).  No matter what, Google has invested a lot in Google Chrome and will support it in the future.  It's just important to note that the Chromebook is at least a great web browser enabled tool, but it's not a complete substitute for a Windows laptop or MacBook Pro with all the s/w installed on a local base.  Web based apps will have some delays and will depend on a decent wifi connection, and how busy the webservers are running other people's apps etc etc.  But it's a neat tool.  You have to understand what you are buying here though.  It's not a traditional laptop as we are used to.This is really neat for on the go or browsing the web on the sofa.It is basically a tablet with a very decent keyboard (to me the same keyboard quality as an Apple MacBook Air or MacBook Pro (this one is nicely backlit), both of which I own and use...Samsung makes the Apple processors in the USA as well as the ones inside this ChromeBook, of course totally different CPUs) and mouse pad (the screen is not a touch screen to not mislead you with the term tablet).  And this is key to understand:  the technology and the micro chip powering this is a processor powering many Samsung tablets; it's for mobile use and concepts.  I should also mention that I am electronics engineer and that I am involved with what's inside that unit.  I purchased this for someone who needed a computer that is portable and can get all the things done young people in particular 'need' ... You Tube, Facebook, Twitter etcThe computing power available in this unit gets it all done sufficiently.  The idea of this unit is that it runs OS Google Chrome and that everything is cloud based, meaning you store most of your stuff on the web primarily (and 16GB of local storage to hold apps and immediately needed stuff) , so it's accessible on any computer anywhere in the world even if you do not carry your Chrome Book with you.  Therefore the 16GB local storage are enough for most people, and the unit comes with 100GB of cloud based storage (Google Drive Cloud Storage) (free for 2 years and then a nominal fee, check with Google).  This chrome book has 2GB DDR3 RAM and a 16 GB Solid State Drive (no mechanical harddrive), sufficient to not limit you (and there is an SD card reader for more stuff).  What's important to have is the WiFi connection, so you can browse the web and use the cloud storage and use all your apps (Of course you can play locally stored apps like angry bird etc).  This computer has a very good wifi radio with all the standards running (wifi 802.11 a/b/g/n 2x2).  It also has blue tooth, so you can stream your music channels from Pandora to an external Bluetooth compatible speaker system for example.  Works great.The machine is as good as the apps you use (word processing, spreadsheet etc) in rough terms.  There is software/apps to be productive on the go, play,read, or browse the web (with wifi connection) or 'socialize' with Facebook etc...I meant to say use social media ;-).This Chromebook is connectivity itself.  It has the newest USB 3.0 port and also a USB2.0 port to afford all compatibility and speed.  It has a HDMI port, so you can playback anything on your big screen.  There is an SD card reader.  And as mentioned wifi of course (the lifeline to make this what it is for) and the Bluetooth interface (3.0). There are internal stereo speakers (ok) and headphone/mic connectivity.  External storage is really unlimited (the web itself or in more practical terms all the web server space you 'own/lease' , so you are not limited by the previously mentioned 100GB of free for 2 years Google Drive Cloud Storage (you can rent more) and there are other safe on-line storage solutions which you can access from anywhere in the world with or without your chrome book).  So the future of your stuff does not depend on the lifetime of your Chromebook in case you end its life going diving with it.The screen is a low-glare matte screen in HD quality (11.6\" with 1366 x 768 pixels), which you can appreciate if you ever owned a MacBook Air etc and you cannot control the lighting situation.The battery can last a lot longer than 6 hours (I have seen 8 hours), officially 6.5 hours average.Booting up is about instant due to the solid state storage (and the operating system) once the machine had been set up with google credentials and the wifi, which takes 'no time'.  The Chromebook updates automatically and because everything is cloud based, virus protection is build in and there is no extra software required for that, so really completely carefree operation.I wish I had this option a few years ago when I purchased my MacBook Air for ~ $1500.  Of course this Chromebook is high quality plastic, but it is surprisingly solid considering the cost of this ChromeBook.Overall this gets 5 stars for what this unit delivers from functionality to value to ease of operation.

The Samsung Chromebook is meant to be just a Chrome browser packed in a quiet, lightweight machine.

I have an older 13\" Macbook that I use in clamshell mode with in external monitor as a desktop.  I have that for when I need to access websites that my Chromebook can't, like a school site the uses Silverlight.  For most of my web surfing and email, I prefer my Chromebook.  The keyboard is really good (a bit slicker than a Macbook, but still good) and the trackpad is responsive (not perfect, but good).  The battery lasts a long time, especially when the screen brightness is lower.  I can even use Remote Desktop to get back to my main computer if I need to do something I can't do on my Chromebook.  The Chromebook is ideal for times when you want to just grab a computer and browse because it starts up VERY quickly and has a good keyboard.  It is lightweight enough that taking it to school isn't a chore.  The computing speed is pretty good, there is no annoying fan or excessive heat to burn your legs.

I read a bunch of complaints in the reviews  about how your chromebook becomes pretty much useless if there isn't an internet connection.

I use google everything but was not sold that this device could satisfy my needs. The first few days I was pretty convinced that I was going to need to take this chromebook back. I then learned a few tricks about the OS that I liked and remembered that this is afterall a $250 laptop.I was interested in this particular model because it runs an ARM cpu and that should promise better battery life. Furthermore, as Ubuntu (linux distro) keeps pushing into the phone market Linux support for ARM is getting stronger everyday. In fact, if wanted this \"chromebook\" will run Ubuntu 13.04, I have done it and it works remarkably well.At first I wanted to compare this device to my nexus 4 or $3000 gaming computer. Neither of which is a fair comparison and led to my immediate dissatisfaction with the device.I broke out my old Asus EEE PC netbook and decided to compare against that. The EEE PC never satisfied my needs in regards to battery life and overall functionality; particularly it had WiFi issues at my University and would rarely go more than 3 hours between charges. I also had to shut it off to put it in my bag and thus take a minute or so booting back up at the beginning of every class.This chromebook appears to easily go its advertised 6.5 hours. I would estimate I am getting about 7 to 8 hours per full charge actually. The display is adequate but you won't be watching movies with friends or doing any work outside. The screen is a matte finish which to me is ideal for its application. The device produces very little heat, could even just be heat trapped from my own body when using it on my lap, thus I have no issues closing it and throwing it in a book bag. Next, even if I did shut it down, this thing is reliably booting up in just under 10 seconds.Obviously this is not my gaming computer or even nexus 4, I say that because most of everything you can do on it is ran from the chrome web browser. As mentioned before I am an avid user of Google products, so the transition to google docs, google calendar, etc was not difficult or foreign to me.So what changed. Well first knowing I can use Ubuntu if I want and that it runs better than it did on my EEE PC (direct comparison). Secondly learning how to open webapps in a way that tricks me into thinking its a native app. I know this is silly but I don't like the idea of everything I open being a tab in chrome. You can \"right click\" and change the way \"apps\" open and one such way is to open in a window. For me this makes for a cleaner user experience.The software is constantly being updated and is completely seamless to the user. I have \"wiped the device\" a few times now and logging back in everything is just as you left it minus files locally stored, welcome to the cloud. Early versions of the software apparently had issues with the major video streaming services. I have used netflix, hulu, youtube, and amazon with no issues.Pros-Price-Battery Life-Seamless user experience-Option of Ubuntu as an OS-Weight-Bluetooth Audio A2DP support in newest Beta releaseCons-Few native apps (Gotten better since Google I/O 2013 and introduction of packaged apps)-lack of bluetooth audio (fixed as of May 24, 2013 on Beta channel)After a week with this laptop I am pretty sure I will be keeping it.

This laptop runs Chrome OS which means it essentially only runs the Chrome browser, so being connected to the internet is crucial to get the full functionality of this laptop. With that said, there is some use offline as well.I love this laptop. It does everything I need it to when I being it to class with me. I use Google Drive to store all of the information from my classes. Since it doesn't run Microsoft, I export everything to the Google equivalent and it works fantastically. Other than PowerPoints not opening in Google Slides if they are over a certain size (which I remedy by using my library's computers to cut the presentation into two, then upload it to Drive). I collaborate with my lab groups using Google Docs, and all of the websites I need for homework (blackboard, mastering physics, reddit) run smoothly.The battery life (I usually get around 6 or 7 hours depending on how bring I keep the screen) combined with the small charger are great when I am on campus the whole day. I don't have to lug around my primary laptop (which is over 7 pounds) just to take notes, do problems, or write papers. It connects to the wireless at my school flawlessly (which can be a pain in especially crowded areas), due to the a/b/g/n connectivity capabilities. Also, my phone has free mobile hotspots, so I am able to connect to the internet a good amount of time.It is a light, portable, affordable laptop that packs a punch as long as you know what you're buying, a laptop that only runs a browser, and how to fully utilize the Google experience.Update: Google slides seem to be as to open larger documents now. Overall, I still use this laptop just about everyday. The only downsides are that I cannot find a good PDF editor to notate my textbooks with and one of my classes requires the use of flylab, which is java based and I cannot get to run on the Chromebook.

Over the first two months and many automatic updates later, I have a smooth operating, 6+ hour battery life, fantastic machine.The gap between Chromebooks and traditional mac/pc's is slimmer than many people make it out to be. Yes this machine cannot do much offline aside from watching previously downloaded video on the 15 gb drive or using the google editing suite as long as it is installed (docs, presentations, spreadsheets). Comparing what most people use their mac/pc's for when internet is not available, the typical user will have similar if not identical useability.My biggest highlight of this machine is the stability of the Chrome operating system. Malware, viruses, and other problems that bog down pc's (and mac's to a lesser degree) don't do a single blessed thing to performance of my Chromebook. I'll make a guess this is thanks to the unique cloud software setup from Google that keeps viruses at bay, and performance at a high and stable level.For $250, you will not find a comparable computer with performance or parts that can keep up. The 6+ hour battery keeps me up and working (or playing :p) much longer than I had before. This chromebook is a great jumping point as a second computer for the traveling professional, or even a primary machine for the typical internet browsing person.What this is for:- web browsing- word editing (through google docs)- use of web applications- online video up to 720p (1080p works but I notice that the frame rate per second is a little slow for my liking)What this is NOT for:- complex data editing (excel, access, other database software that is not available)- photo editing (again, not isntallable software)- games that require high amounts of RAM and CPU power", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent for what it is and a great value", "Author": "Margaret Picky", "ReviewID": "R34ZVS3N6LWQY2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Samsung Chromebook is perhaps the best value in an electronic device that I have ever owned.  I was already a heavy user of Google services (browser, mail, calendar, documents, music, videos, talk, etc.) so it was not a hard decision to buy one when this new version came out, primarily for taking notes during an evening literature course.  My regular computer is a Mac mini.The Chromebook was on backorder but when it came back in stock, I placed the order and it arrived the afternoon before the first class.  It is so simple and intuitive that I was able to get it set up and become familiar enough with it to take notes in class that evening without any problems, although I did go a few minutes early to set up the Wi-Fi.  It also allows me to have access to Kindle books while in class for the discussion.It really is much better than I expected it to be.  I was surprised at how thin and attractive it is compared to the photographs\u2014they make it look clunky.  It is about the size of a standard spiral-bound notebook.  Even the power brick is small.From reading the reviews, I was very worried about the quality of the screen and its brightness but the matte screen is ideal for my use and it is more than bright enough\u2014I don't even keep it on high.  I was also worried that it would look and feel cheap, flex, and scratch easily.  It is definitely plastic and not metal but I appreciate the how light it is and have not had trouble with it scratching and the hinge is sturdy.  The only way it feels cheap is that concentrated pressure on the back of the lid will cause ripples in the screen.  It is not the most powerful computer as far as storage and RAM but I think of it as a tablet with a keyboard rather than as a laptop.Other things I really like are how it starts up almost instantly, the excellent quality of the keyboard and touchpad, how easily it connects to Wi-Fi, and the attractive design. The design is also very thoughtful in little ways such as the slot to open it with, the placement of the headphone jack, and the special function keys.There are definitely some things I don't like.  It is very difficult to select text with the touchpad so at home, I use a wireless mouse when I want to copy & paste or format text.  Every once in a while, when I am taking notes, the Google Docs tab crashes and says \"Aw, Snap!\"  I have never lost anything and it is easy to recover from that by opening a new tab but it is aggravating and I don't know why it happens.  I also do not feel 100% comfortable using public Wi-Fi so I have sometimes used it in class without connecting to it.Overall, though, I really like the Samsung Chromebook.

It is super thin and extremely light (lighter than most all laptops including ultrabooks), and has a nice keyboard and trackpad that feel very Macbook Air-ish.Software:The software on the Chromebook if you don't already know is Chrome OS. It is built around the Google Chrome internet browser, so everything you do is online, with the exception of offline Google docs. Chromebooks are used to be cloud computing devices. With that being said, if you don't use the Google ecosystem you might not be the most satisfied with Chromebook, because Chrome OS relies deeply on Google integration (Google Drive, Google Chrome, Google Play Music, and pretty much everything Google).Using this Chromebook:My experience with the laptop has been very good so far. This Chromebook is good enough for most daily tasks on the web. (And is as a mentioned above, is a great piece of hardware for the price). If all you want to do is go on the web and you want something simple, and easy to use, then this is a good device for you. The fact that it awakes from sleep so quickly and is instantly ready to go is really great. What you are giving up with a cheap device like this is, is performance. Since it is a lower end device, and the specs are not as beefed up as something like the Chromebook Pixel, you don't get the fastest web experience. Don't get me wrong, websites load very quickly and it is a stable experience, however, the web performance is not quite buttery smooth. Scrolling thru content filled web pages can be a little choppy, and YouTube videos can be stuttery at times, but for the most part, when streaming HD videos from YouTube and other sites such as Netflix, the experience is good enough. Also, Chrome OS does not support full PC or Mac programs so if that is something that you were expecting from this Chromebook, then I would suggest you look elsewhere.

That's a lot of what I do on a computer.This sumsung chromebook suits that purpose very well, especially for the $250 price. It has a good keyboard, although I prefer the keyboard on the CR-48 (google's prototype machine from a couple of years back) which has more bounce in the keys. The trackpad is much better than the CR-48. But what really makes this special is that it's lightweight and quiet (no fan).Because of the light weight, ironically, it's easier to do tablet like reading on it than a tablet. Often I find myself holding  it with one hand, my left, underneath the keyboard, while my right hand scrolls on the trackpad. Because of the weight distribution of the L shape of a screen/keyboard laptop, it's more comfortable to balance in my palm than trying to hold a flat tablet with one hand.I should mention the experience I had with a defect unit. I originally bought this on Amazon several months ago. The one thing that I didn't like about it was that the screen looked \"grainy\", not very clear. But, because I had bought the unit online and had not been able to demo it in the store, I assumed that was the way it was. The screen over time started to flicker and turn blue on the sides. I eventually returned it and bought another unit. With this second unit, the screen is not grainy; it's much better than the first one ever was. If I would have demoed it in the store I would have realized the first one was a defect and returned it right away.As far as the chrome OS is concerned, I enjoy the fast boot up times and easy maintenance of having an OS dedicated to a browser. I do however, like to use a linux shell for some of my work/research/fun. Although there a lot of online options via the browser, like Cloud 9, I like to have my own local machine to play with. I recently bought a Raspberry Pi (only $35 dollars) for this purpose.I have the Raspberry Pi in the basement, plugged in to the ethernet and always on. I use the chrome plug in \"Secure Shell\" to connect to the raspberry pi and do linux shell stuff. It's fast and seamless.

Especially if you're someone who does a lot of typing and isn't a fan of doing it on tablet screens!I don't use it much myself, but I've talked with the recipient extensively, and this is a summary of their thoughts. They're a professional video editor who uses this as a supplemental portable computer when traveling, or just around the house where the have wi-fi and don't want to be chained to a serious editing station computer.Form: This is a compact, sexy looking laptop. Although it's plastic, it's well built, slim, and finished to look like brushed aluminum. Very nice. Notably, the keyboard is a full sized for normal human hands. I sort of expected it to feel cramped, but it feels normal sized and eminently usable.Specs: Screen is 1366-by-768 (16:9) so while you won't be able to view full 1080p video, 720 video looks great though. Dual Core processor w/ 2gb ram made web browsing with numerous tabs open quite snappy. Performance does drop off a bit if you're one of those crazy people who has to have 20 or 30 or 40+ tabs open at the same time. Camera is unequivocally made for things like skype, not for taking high-def pictures, but it suits its purpose just fine. For ports, you've got one each of USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and HDMI, so you can connect a mouse if you want or link it up to your TV for streaming HD video! There is a card reader for SD/SDHC/SDXC and audio has a mic input and headphone output. Local storage is somewhat compact at 16gb, but this is compensated by google drive access (100gb free for two years!) and can be supplemented by dropbox, amazon cloud, skydrive, etc.Web Apps: The giftee already lived extensively in the google web-app environment so they jumped right in! When I purchased it, this came with two years of 100gb google drive storage. Pretty cool. Otherwise web apps and such work just the way you expect them to work.Overall: If you want a super portable and very stylish laptop, you're comfortable working in the google environment of web apps, you have ready access to wi-fi, and you're on a budget so you don't want to shell out ~$1000 for a mac air, this is a fantastic product.Negatives:1) You really need to have wi-fi access to use this most effectively. Evaluate your wi-fi accessibility carefully before you take the plunge, and note that your local storage is limited to 16gb. Without that extra 100gb of google drive, or access to your dropbox/amazon cloud/skydrive you can easily feel the constrained.2) There is no support for netflix. Presently, every chromebook EXCEPT for this one (Samsung, ARM based) can stream netflix. Hulu and Amazon streaming both work fine but this is a pretty glaring negative for folks who are thinking about a chromebook for its portability and access to web apps.EDIT:The Samsung Chromebook now supports netflix streaming. I'll leave the original review for posterity, but negative #2 is effectively removed. I don't think it bumps this chromebook up to a 5th star, as negative #1 still stands, but it's a very nice improvement, and I'm very glad that google/samsung kept their commitment to netflix support!", "Date": "January 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the teenager in the house", "Author": "Jessica J.

For my uses it is absolutely perfect. I really love this thing so far.I basically have four main uses I bought this for.First, I wanted something that sits on the end table next to me that turns on instantly and I can pop up a browser to look up something I heard on the TV, or figure out a place to go eat, etc. The Chromebook hits that right on the mark. I have tried various android tablets, and iPad, and MAc / Windows laptops. The Macbook Air my wife had was the closest but still I prefer the Chromebook so far. The main reasons are the instant on and connected (no waiting for anything what so ever after opening the lid). In addition the the browsing using the trackpad is very much like the MacbookAir (responsive scrolling with two fingers). The browsing experience is flawless so far, and seems really fast.Second, I wanted something to watch Amazon Instant Videos on, and while I have only watched a couple of trailers so far everything has been great. The speakers are pretty bad, but I use headphones for that.Third, I wanted to have a laptop up with ESPN Gamecast on during football games (and I expect to do the same during NASCAR season). I like to keep an eye on the stats without waiting for the TV to fill me in. The built in base (because it has a keyboard) keeps the screen at a great angle to look over and see without having to go pick it up.Finally, I wanted something I can take on business trips to watch videos. I will update my review when I have actually done this but it looks plausible to download videos and watch them from an SD card.I have tried many iterations (and frankly I have purchased from BestBuy because I can return them more easily after trying them for a few weeks). I have tried the MacbookAir ($1100 was way too pricey to meet these needs, but equally effective as the Chromebook). Various android tablets (the Slider was almost there but touching the screen to scroll, small keyboard, and screen angle). The google nexus 7 (great for reading in bed but not sitting next to the couch).The things that you probably still need a laptop for are Office apps (rollapps openOffice beta looks promising though), anything you need to VPN into to get to your corporate apps, and any windows only apps that have to be installed. Also printing is special. You have to use Google cloud print, which means you either get a cloud print ready printer, or on a computer that does have the printer drivers installed open chrome and use that to print through.Overall I am extremely impressed and happy with this purchase. $250 and does most everything I need. I would think that if I had kids that needed a laptop this would be ideal as well. They do mostly web things (facebook, instagram, etc), but the Google Docs apps (spreadsheetthey can do all of their homework with that.

You're not expecting this to look or feel like a Macbook Air (neither the display nor the trackpad are going to meet THAT expectation, but they are better than other \"netbooks\" you may have used).Just buy it. It's $249 bucks for a little portable laptop that has a baked in backup and sync plan. Anything you do on it out in the field can be pulled right back up from your main desktop Chrome browser. It turns on fast and it weighs about as much as a paperback book. Make sure you have plenty of Wi-FI or hotspot access because otherwise it's not going to do much for you (there are 2 USB ports, so you could plug in a Cellular data stick if you have one).One thing I'm still experimenting with is the output to external monitors. The graphics card is fast and clean enough, but perhaps not configurable to every external monitor you can think of. Sometimes it mirrors, sometimes it only displays on the external monitor. That's an HDMI cable connection, by the way.So, look... here's a little 11\" solid state netbook you can hand off to your younger kids and not have a heart attack everytime they're quiet for 30 seconds (there's a guest login account that will act like an incognito browser, without saving any settings or history). As of right now Google is giving out 100 GB of drive storage free for a couple years along with these... you redeem it through a \"Goodies\" window upon initial setup. You don't get to return the laptop and keep the cloud storage, though.Bottom line, it's a solid build of an excellent concept.

I love my Macs.The pros vs. the cons of Chromebook ownership for me are as follows:PROS1. Affordable. Very affordable for a laptop.2. Almost everything you do is stored in \"the cloud\" - mostly on Google's servers.3. Since you can store everything in the cloud, there is little or no risk of your data being stolen from the computer. The 16GB of onboard storage almost assure you that documents you create on the Chromebook will be stored in the cloud.4. Your cloud files can be accessed with other other computers, Macs, PC, tablets, smart phones, etc. with the right login credentials.5. The Chromebook is small.6. It is very light. Easy to carry around and take anywhere.7. The 11.6 inch screen is more than adequate to do work, view online content. I have no problems with screen resolution.8. Most of the time I do not need to remove it from my travel bag when I have to go through airport security.9. Streams audio very well.10. Google allows you to store up to 16,000 of your favorite songs for free on their Google Cloud Music player. Those songs then can be easily streamed back to the Chromebook or any other device.11. Other audio services such as iHeart Radio, Pandora, Amazon Cloud Player, Spotify and Tuned In Radio work just fine.12. If you do only one video stream at the time, the Chromebook works fine.13. While it has a tablet processor, it also has a keyboard... so yes, it is like a tablet on steroids. I picked this over buying an iPad Mini.14. You can plug USB devices into the ports so that you can also use a mouse, USB memory stick, and even an external hard drive.15. Of the 2 USB ports, one of them is USB 3 the other USB 2.16. Can run on battery all day without much worry of having to recharge.17. Many free online apps are available at the Chrome store.18. Several tabs can be left open on the Chrome browser at the same time without taking much of a performance hit.19. The Chromebook is fast enough for most users. I have no problems with the speed of this device.20. As a secondary computer to my Macs, this fits the bill well.CONS1. You need to be in the vicinity of a WiFi hotspot to get the most out of the Chromebook. If you have WiFi at home, work or school then you're good to go.2. If you are on the road, then you are at the mercy of finding a WiFi hotspot that you can hopefully gain free access to.3. I subscribe to a MiFi device service which is an extra monthly cost.4. Offline mode could be improved. The built in apps for music, video and photo playback are crude at best.5. Offline Gmail is sluggish.6. The OS could use a better desktop interface. It is a little clunky transferring documents to an external device.7. Offline documents have to be stored somewhere, and the 16 GB of onboard storage space is quite limiting especially since the Chrome OS uses the same space.8. I wish the Chrome browser was like the one I have for my Mac where the app icons show up on the browser window itself instead of being stored in the icon mess at the bottom of the task bar.CAVEATS1. When you travel (especially at airports and overseas; anywhere where your computer could face inspection or even seizure) be sure that you are completely logged off your Google account and that the computer is completely turned off.2. You should be logged off your Google account should you be away from the Chromebook for any length of time.CONCLUSIONI use my Chromebook a lot. As a secondary device to my Macs, this is a fine computer to use on the road when you need to do something quick and dirty and yet maintain a level of security that you cannot find in other laptops (no documents stored on the device).

It's still a wonderful device in many ways. But don't you just hate it when something starts our stellar, and then somehow manages to degrade over time? Well, that's what's happened with ChromeOS on this device, in my opinion. A month or two ago, I reported a couple bugs, one of which described significant degradation in boot time. The first few months that I used the device, it was just under 10 seconds to get to the login screen, and negligible time after logging in before the device was useful. Well, something changed such that the initial boot is still maybe 10 seconds, but now there's a solid 20 seconds of nothing but black screen after logging in. No progress indicator. Nothing. Just a dark screen.The first time it happened, I thought perhaps my machine was hosed. I've since somewhat gotten used to what I now consider a 30 second overall boot time. In other words, who cares if it's only 10 seconds to the login screen, just for the privilege of waiting another 20 seconds for the device to become useful? That's rather disappointing given one of the big selling points was the quick boot time. I acquired a Lenovo Thinkpad in roughly the same time period, which had Windows 7 pre-installed on it, and although I haven't timed it, I'd be surprised to discover that Windows 7 was taking longer than 30 seconds to boot. The last thing I want to be feeling is that I'm booting no faster than Windows, if you know what I mean.Another disappointment is that a developer responded to that bug by listing a several step process to try the next time I experienced the problem, which I think would result in being able to obtain and provide them more debug information. But you know what? I didn't spend a couple hundred bucks to become a gratis software developer/tester for Google and/or Samsung. I reported the device I'm using, and the OS level/build. It seems to me that companies with such deep pockets should be able to debug this without my help, or should at least be throwing me some kind of bone for helping fix their products.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've owned many, *many* computers over 3 decades (I began the madness with a Timex Sinclair in the early 1980's). This is the only computer I've owned where the pleasure/pain ratio is greater than 1, where I'm not in a constant state of denial about the amount of effort/pain required to keep the OS up to date or install applications, the amount of agonizing over where files live, the amount of sitting through tedious reboots, the amount of wondering why things don't seem quite right after emerging from \"sleep\", etc., etc., etc. (it's hard to remember all aspects of the nightmare when you're halfway decent at denial). MS Windows always required huge amounts of denial about such things. Linux was better, but even there you wound up spending a lot of time as an admin (which is fine if you enjoy it... but do you? really? are you sure?)This little wonder just plain works.I have tiny gripes, but they're simple and reasonable given the price point. The screen isn't as large as I'm used to. The sound quality could be better (it's tinny even in earbuds). I wish the balloon that announces how much battery life I have when I plug the power supply in wouldn't appear at all. A Google Doc session will occasionally lock up (seems to be if/when I'm typing too fast). Browser tabs refreshing was an issue until I enabled the experimental memory caching option. Opening a Javascript intensive page can degrade audio/video playback a bit. The keyboard isn't back-lit.But, really, other than those trivialities, it's been glorious. I wasn't expecting to run numerous CPU intensive processes concurrently. It connects to hotel wifi without the usual struggles or mysteries. It boots from dead off as fast as advertised, and comes out of sleep essentially instantly, and with no \"sleep side-effects weirdness\". Just boom, and it's there. It's very light and quiet (no fan!).I can't express how wonderful it's been to no longer be cursing the day that personal computers were born. I'm doing all the fun things I love, but none of the admin, maintenance, or worrying about viruses. Every now and then it tells me that the latest Chrome OS is ready to be installed the next time I reboot. That happens quickly and efficiently. Totally effortless.I've read that I could boot it in \"developer mode\" so I could play with the devilish details. While it's nice to know that option is available, having experienced the bliss of *not* sweating the details, why would I open that can of worms again? Okay, my geeky ego could find moments of pleasure in that kind of pain. But the part of me that just wants to listen to streaming music, watch streaming videos, network socially, and read about the insanity also known as the human species is ecstatic that it doesn't have to sit in a stinky pile of techno dung to do all that.Kudos, Google and your hardware partners like Samsung!", "Date": "July 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "Completely taken by surprise about how much I love it", "Author": "C.

I have a custom built gaming computer powerhouse that runs Windows 7. I have a Macbook Air running, of course, OSX, An Asus laptop that runs Ubuntu. And I've decided to dip my toes into Google's submission in the computer operating system world. I decided to get this laptop seeing as it suited my needs perfectly. I needed an easy throwaround laptop. Something I could toss in a backpack or walk around the house, laptop under my arm. My ubuntu laptop was a but too chunky, and my Macbook air. Far too expensive and I'm simply scared of damaging it. So this, being tiny, durable, and under a quarter of the cost of my macbook seemed ideal.The packaging is nice. Nothing like an Apple product, with a carry handle and shiny stickers everywhere. But it's certainly better than your typical brown box industrial packaging a lot of the other laptops come in. It's easy to unbox, and once I got it out of the box and plugged in (from what I could tell, it came with no charge at all in it) I was up and running almost immediately. Setup takes two or three minutes. Less than that if you have a Google Account.So, you're on the home screen. Of course, the first thing you notice is the display. It's certainly not the retina display or ultra high resolution of some of the newer competing ultra books. But it's more than sufficient. The brightness is solid and the only complaint I have is the viewing angle is sort of limited. But really, you don't care. The Chrome OS gives you a very simple, yet informative introduction. So now that we're on the subject, let's talk about the OS, shall we?It's simple. And we're not talking about elegantly simple like OSX is. When you open up your book, You'll see your background and almost nothing else. No shortcuts. Nothing. The only thing that you see is something that is very similar to the windows taskbar. Except instead of a start button, it's a Chrome symbol, along with a couple recently opened \"apps\" Everything is extremely snappy, especially considering the conventionally sluggish CPU. But it's the way this laptop utilizes the power it has that is fun. The perfect integration of onboard computing and cloud based computing hits a sweet spot. Making any task I've done so far snappy, and quick. It comes with a few apps pre installed. You can install more from Googles play market. But what comes on it already replace your typical Windows programs. I love the fact that everything self updates and you never ever have to worry about viruses. updating. Anything like that. Just turn on and go. How cool is that?Let's talk about build quality? Well, again, for the price they sell this laptop at. You're not going to get a Macook's aluminum uni body construction Or Alienware's over the top looks. But they've taken your dollar very far for the price tag given. The best description I can give for the looks is a plastic Macbook air. It's pretty clear the thing is plastic, but it still feels as if it could take some heavy abuse. The keyboard is.. well, let me say this. I've decided to type this review, just as an excuse to clack away on the keyboard some. It's a pleasure to use. I haven't gotten a chance to use the webcam to any extent yet, but it's, from what I've seen so far, sufficient. The touchpad is large and supports multitouch gestures! And well too! The battery life I've seen is impressive. I haven't watched the exact time. But six or seven hours on full brightness watching youtube videos is doable. The charger does have a power brick. But it's very small. I love the fact that this doesn't have a hard drive. Sure, you think only a 16 gig flash drive will suck. But the 105 gigs of free google drive, plus the fact that there's not need for a fan is amaazing.In the end, this laptop proves that there is such a thing as \"cheap and cheerful\" The value is on an extreme level. Especially considering that you get 100 gigs free of Google Drive, plus 12 passes of Gogo free internet passes. In short, I'm in love with my Chromebook. I'm sold. And if you buy one and know what you're buying, you'll be more than happy. I promise.UPDATE:It's been around a month since I've picked up my Chromebook. And if anything, I'm using it just as much, and loving it more. Granted, it's only been a month, so I can't speak on the longevity of the device, and that's important to me, but I can go a little bit deeper into my original review. Anyway,I sort of hate to write this next bit, seeing as I like to think I take advantage of the money I've spent, and I'm sort of an Apple fanboy. But my Chromebook has made my iPad and my Macbook air start to collect dust. See, when I wake up, the first thing I do is reach over and grab my device of choice sitting next to my bed and use it to entertain myself in various ways until I finish my morning coffee and breakfast. Usually it would be my iPad, but since purchasing my Chromebook, I reach for that almost every morning, without exception. But does that mean that it can replace the Macbook air or iPad in ever way? No. But it's not supposed to. But on your every day tasks such as internet surfing or Netflix watching it'll do just as well as the rest of them.I've gotten to check out some of the various applications that the Chrome OS has to offer via the Play Store. The library of apps is impressive for such a new operating system. I've actually done some photo editing with a FREE app on from the Play Store. I will admit, with the conventionally slow hardware, you can get a little bit of choppiness from editing a photo that's large. But it's still usable. And impressive. It's interesting to do intensive photo editing inside your internet browser. But overall, it was a good experience. Especially considering that it didn't cost me a cent.I have a bad habit of opening several youtube videos at once. Call it ADD, but I just can't be satisfied with one video. The Chromebook had no problem loading and playing a youtube video while a dozen or so tabs were open, each with their own youtube videos. Again, surprising for the typically outdated hardware.Another thing I've noticed is that updates. Or should I say something that I've hardly noticed. The OS stays updated automatically. Say goodbye to the \"remind me to restart my computer in X hours\" or the notification in the app store. The updates download in the background. And for the most part install in the background all without you even noticing. For a big update it'll just install on your next restart. But it won't bug you to do so.I'll update again when I can vouch for this machines longevity. But I have no doubt of it. I'm loving it so far, and am debating getting the new Pixel Chromebook. I'm sold on the Chrome Os. In the meantime. Hope I've helped you out.UPDATE-Six months or so in, Still using my Chromebook daily and loving it. As far as the hardware, I'm not gonna lie. I've been mean to this laptop. I've been far from gentle, and it's handled me beating the snot out of it no problem. From carrying it around the house by the hinge in the back. To Me throwing it five feet onto my my bed or into my backpack which in turn gets thrown around. Speakers always on full blast, almost always running on straight battery. Yeah. I've been rough on this thing. And it has shown no signs of giving up. So the hardware is no problem. That's like brand new still..On to the software. Now that is even better than when I bought it. I'm impressed by Google's support. The updates are frequent, and always improving things. For example, when I first got this machine, if I were to have several tabs open and for example, one of them was youtube. If I switched away from that tab you would get a little studder in the audio. That is all but gone now. New features are always being added in the background, too. As far as viruses, this is nothing you need to worry about. I've frequented some less than reputable sites and I have no problems. Very impressed by Google on this one.I'm excited to take this on my next plane trip seeing as it comes with the free gogo passes from airplanes. I'll do another update after my upcoming trip in a month. I've been recommending checking out Chrome OS to all my friends lately, but people seem to be afraid of change. I can understand that. Honestly though, after trying Windows 8, that horrible mish mash of an operating system. If you have the chance. Give Chrome a shot.Update- One year in:So it might now be exactly one year that I've owned this thing. But it's around there. Just figured I'd give another update. It's still running strong. (typing on it right now) I'll attack the one problem I've had right off the bat. The left speaker seems to be starting to die. I can hear it cut out occasionally. Not dead yet. But I expect it to die sometimes soon. Probably a wire came loose somewhere. One other thing, I was having an issue one day where the whole system would just randomly crash about five minutes into using it. I cleared the browers history and cookies and it went back to normal.

Lamoureux \"car auctioneer\"", "ReviewID": "ROFCKJZIJQ45U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second Chromebook, the first being the previous generation Samsung XE500 purchased last year.  That model had the Intel Atom processor, this on has the ARM chip. I'll compare the two later in the review, which I will try to keep short.Like a lot of other reviewers, I completely agree with the assessment the Chromebook makes a GREAT second computer.  But I'm going to try to make mine the PRIMARY go-to computer.  I like it that much. My current primary is a Mac Mini desktop which is getting a little old and, while it has performed well for years, I'm getting tired of difficult, complicated operating systems in general.Before buying my new Chromebook however, I went to Best Buy last week and bought a Windows 8, touchscreen, Samsung Ultrabook.  After a week of struggling up the learning curve on the new operating system and the hardware I returned it to the store and got my $750 back.  Windows 8 has some beautiful features and the touchscreen technology has its charms but everything else?  Forgeddaboutit!  Good lord, what a complicated nightmare of anti-virus, anti-malware software and constant, lengthy operating system updates.  No doubt I spent more time working on updating and installing software than I did enjoying content.Maybe I'm spoiled by the Chromebook environment which led to my impatience with Windows 8.  But I tried, I really did, to embrace their new technology.  In the end, however, it just isn't worth the effort.Yesterday, for 1/3 the price,I bought my new Chromebook, lifted the lid, input my Google account name and password and POOF, instant familiarity.  All my apps, contacts, calendar and browsing tabs were there, just like on my old Chromebook.  In less than 30 seconds. Then my system said an update was available.  No problem, another 30 seconds.Take that Mac and Windows.So, instead of wasting time downloading yet another Adobe Acrobat or iTunes update, I will spend some free time learning how to get rid of traditional operating systems altogether.  Here's how I tackle some common Chromebook complaints:Printing:  Buy a Google Cloud Print ready wireless printer.  Plug it in, follow the instructions and a few minutes you're printing. Or use Google Cloud Print to access the printer hooked up to your primary home or office desktop.Scanning:  Use the same printer/scanner to scan to a USB chip, then plug same into your Chromebook. Yes, it sounds inelegant but have you ever used scanning software?  Yuk.  Doesn't work half the time. Apple Image Capture is hardly a walk in the park for most folks.  It's much easier to place the document on the glass and press the \"scan\" button.Office productivity software (Word/Excel/Powerpoint):  Use Google Docs instead.  It has all the features 99% of us ever will need.Double Entry Accounting: I thought this was going to get me, but I found a free, cloud-based app on the Chrome Web Store.I could go on and on, but you get my point.  If you look around you can find solutions online that obviate the need for Photoshop, MS Office, etc.  Sure, some of you professional video editors and engineers are going to need your trusty, high-powered software, but not the rest of us.Chromebook Comparison:  The newer ARM Chromebook is marginally faster loading pages and operating in general, but not by a long shot.  The screen is smaller but seems brighter, crisper and renders colors better.  That said, you won't confuse the display on either with a high-end Ultrabook from Sony, for instance, but it works fine for everyday use.  Battery life is excellent in both models.  New model is smaller in every dimension including weight.  But the biggest knock on the newer, ARM-based Chromebooks is the current inability to play Netflix. A solution is still a few months away, but that's not enough to keep me away.  I can watch Netflix on my DVD player or Roku box, so no problem there.I encourage you to buy one of these and embrace the cloud!

Like my title says, it's somewhere between a Netbook & MacBook Air. The keyboard and silver back style is totally a mac knock off but it works. I think it's got a great little build to it. Keyboard flows amazingly, I have been typing documents & emails and it's a tremendous quality for how small it is. I'm a big dude, 6' 4'' with huge oaf hands and fingers, it still feels comfortable to me. This is a great little machine if YOU LIVE ON THE WEB. You're not going to do anything crazy with this. I had some skips while listening to a 30 minute clip from a radio show on YouTube and trying to do other stuff. I also had a little bit of trouble watching HBO GO. Then again, my network isn't an amazing connection, it's mediocre speeds at best. I bet with a better connection the video experience will be just fine. But for $249 you get a Samsung quality machine, with a mac feel, and a netbook performance. Display isn't going to blow you away but for $250 it's definitely passable. I also hear Netflix is making its own App for the Chromebook, which sounds amazing, I have a Netflix app will work great on this machine. I Love Google Drive storage and love that this thing boots up like a tablet. Its small enough to literally take anywhere and have a laptop-esque experience, without the booting up & Windows/Mac desktop booting for 15 minutes.I hope I continue to see more Google & Samsung combinations.

In a few months the problems may be resolved, and there will probably be a well-established path to installing Ubuntu 13.04.  I chose 13.04 because it is receiving more attention from the developers, particularly with support for hardware video acceleration.I also noticed that 720p video with H.264 in the ChromeOS environment is not entirely smooth, but still very watchable.

Literally the best price for a computer that you can find.-The weight. It's really light. It's portable, and yet still has a decently solid feel.-Keyboard. It's full sized and reminiscent of mac keyboards, not the best but it's nice that it is full-sized based off the size of the computer.-Battery life. Not sure what the other reviews said, but got mine to last 7 hours. No complaints here.-Quick Startup. absurdly so.-Basic straightforward layout. Not complicated at all.-Ability to open my other computer's previous browser tabs. That's actually surprisingly innovative and useful.CONS:-It isn't a computer. If you want a computer, then this isn't one. I'd suggest it only as a chromebook and a supplement to an existing computer.-Lack of customization or settings at all... it's frustrating, you literally cannot change anything you want to do... things that come to mind right now:1.It prompts a log in code when I turn it off and on again. (not sleep mode mind you) but since there is only one user I find this to be a waste of time.2.No battery or screen time settings. Sometimes the computer thinks it is idle and will shut off, even if I'm downloading or uploading large files.3.Chromebook has something written in it to make some website believe it is a mobile device. Which it certainly is not. NFL.com for example for some reason doesn't work when you link through the site to the rest of their site. No way to fix this right now.4.Essentially no hard drive or programs at all. They claim this app store, but in all reality it just links you through Chrome to other websites. For example, the news apps and video apps, simply open up the host website. Hulu app? No... it's just hulu.com. Same with Pandora, and countless others. Not apps, just a direct link to the website.5. No way to customize the keyboard. So while I can have different languages like Russian, I can only manually switch between keyboards rather than hit a button combo.-16 GB hard drive makes you rely on your 100 GB Google Drive Cloud, which is fine, unless you have large files and have to wait for downloading and uploading times.-You need internet always.-It scratches and is flimsy. It's been two weeks and it looks like it's been battered by a wolverine... Still works pristinely, but I can't help but think the material is a bit poor.-IT'S COMPLETE LACK OF ANY INNOVATION... it's just Chrome. Not an ounce more.The Point: It's $250, cheaper than pretty much everything. There's nothing like it in its class. It's solid though, it isn't a cheap device. It doesn't feel cheap is what I mean. However, DO NOT BUY if it's your only laptop, and do not expect it to replace your existing. But if you're like me and you need a light portable laptop on the go all day, and don't mind terrible lack of ability to do anything other than CHROME and GOOGLE DOCS. Then here you go.Mind you I love it. Just don't get your hopes up. It's just a browser.

WTH!\"  but once I got to playing around with it and thought more about it, I realized that there was really not an occasion where I was completely without internet access - either because I was at home or I could tether to my cellphone.The apps are simply shortcuts that open a webpage instead of being physically installed on the machine and they can be obtained through the Chrome Store.  Regular Android apps will not work on this!  The 11.6\" screen is super bright if you have the brightness all the way up, but that runs the battery down fast.  The specs state you can get between 6 and 7 hours of battery life from this, but yesterday after I brought it home, I used it heavily for 5 solid hours before I needed to plug it up (videos, streaming music, brightness 100%, adding apps) so I'm thinking that the 6-7 hour estimate is pretty accurate.  The keyboard is pretty nice for what some would describe as \"budget'.  It's responsive and the keys are not stiff like I've heard others say.  The webcam leaves a little to be desired.  It's super laggy and trying to record myself on a video was like watching one of those Sunday afternoon kung-fu movies where the subtitles don't match the lips.  I can attach my flash drive and watch movies on it via the embedded movie player, but if you let the movie pause for too long the chromebook sleeps and then you can't get the movie to come back one without taking out the flash drive and then reinserting it to find the movie.  Must be a way around that.  There's a slot to put in a regular SD card, which is great because I take lots of pictures on my Canon T2i, so that's a nice way to check out new pics on a bigger screen and edit or whatever.  Startup is quick and shutdown is quick.  Hold the power button down for four seconds to shut down and that's it.  Turning it back on is just as fast since there's only a SSD hard drive and no moving parts.This is ideal to travel with.  Just tether it to your phone so you can be sure to get a safe WiFi connection.  It's light and small and if you're a big Google user, then all your stuff is available when you want it.  You can video chat with people on Hangouts or Skype, or stream some music or maybe a movie.  It even asks for a password when you boot up!  Best of all, there's no OS mess to constantly worry about updating because Google OS will update itself.  This little device will take care of itself.

I tried a Chromebook.POSITIVES+ KEYBOARD!!! No more uncomfortable, imprecise touch-screen keyboards like on my tablet. This Chromebook's keyboard is comfortable. I also love the direct, hard shortcut keys for screen brightness, volume, etc. without having to shift with a Fn or Ctrl key.+ The mouse pad works very well, and the Chrome OS has an awesome function where a single tap with one finger is a left-click, and a single tap with two fingers is a right-click. GENIUS! Why has no one else thought of this before?!+ Great battery life, so far, and the system recharges very quickly.+ The system, itself, is very small and very thin, and perfect for quickly picking up on the go or storing in a nook.+ The OS and interface are very straightforward and easy to use, and the two most important applications (Chrome and Gmail) are pre-installed. Just log in with your Gmail account and your email and all of your bookmarks appear magically (well, not technically magic, but something similar). Even though this is not a Windows OS, many of the shortcuts still exist (i.e., Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc.).+ Far less expensive than a tablet, and will provide much of the same benefits, plus a real keyboard.NEGATIVES- Screen resolution could be a bit better (1366x768). It's a little tough to go from 1920x1080 all day on my PCs, and then look at the downgraded res on the Chromebook. This is a big benefit of choosing the Galaxy Note 10.1 2014 (2560x1600), however the Note 10.1 2014 is also $300+ more expensive.- Screen contrast isn't great. Adjusting the screen brightness helps a little, but it still has gray-ish black levels.", "Date": "February 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great for the money", "Author": "Ira", "ReviewID": "R1UAPWM6F85YKL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's a great laptop that runs on a cloud based operating system, don't buy it for your average USB cord printer, You need a cloud printer to print with this wirelessly...you can print your stuff out miles away using the cloud system there is few things I love about this laptop, Their are no mechanical moving parts, It's a solid state unit...That means no moving parts to break and it boots up fast and has a great price.", "Date": "February 21, 2014"}, {"Title": "Does 90% of what a student needs, fantastically well.", "Author": "Chase B.", "ReviewID": "R2WJSZYTA9EPDP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Some quick background information on me and why I bought the product:I am a full time pre-med student who also works full time. Weekends aside, in any given day I have 1-3 hours outside of my school-work-sleep cycle to study for exams, meet other students for group projects, and generally try to stay ahead of the curve in a very competitive, science-heavy curriculum.I bought the chromebook to help me keep everything organized. I frequently found myself in need of a small computer I could use to review notes, check grades, and turn in student assignments. The chromebook does that trick very well. I bought the Case Star Neoprene Laptop Notebook Sleeve (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008FU1HE0/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2) to protect it in the messenger bag I use at school. It was quite cheap, and works great.Pros: -Small, portable, most painless setup I've ever experienced. It was up and running within less than 3 minutes of plugging it in. -Syncs to your Gmail account automatically, including Google docs, anything on your Google drive, keeps your bookmark preferences. -Fairly durable. I'm pretty hard on stuff and I've definitely scuffed it up and have a tendency to leave it in sleep rather than turning it all the way off, for weeks at a time. It performs just as well now as it did the day I got it. -**Notetaking** is a serious breeze with the Chromebook. I have *all* of my notes, for every single class on my chromebook, which automatically syncs to my drive. (This is great because you have automatic, instantaneous access from anywhere you can log into Google.) -MS Excel and PowerPoint knockoffs that work pretty well. I've given in-class presentations with these softwares. -Probably not news to anyone, but it reads PDFs, Excel docs, .docx files perfectly well. The problem comes with editing them. -gdocs exports .docx, .PDF, and .rtf files flawlessly 95% of the time. (Look out for export issues in advanced editing situations like highlighting.)Cons:I have three gripes with the Chromebook, and three only: - No MS Office. This can be a real pain, and though eventually I'm sure Google will get ahead of Microsoft and work out fairly flawless conversion algorithms, the fact is, they're just not there. Converting a project that you started in the lab on Excel over to Google's spreadsheet software is functionally impossible. The data will not properly transfer and you'll be left with an unusable mess. -No touchscreen. I understand that asking for a touchscreen in this price segment is unreasonable, and I'd be happy to pay more for it, but it can be really frustrating to try and sketch the molecular structure of a hydrocarbon with the gdocs \"Insert drawing\" function using the built-in touch-pad. -The Bluetooth doesn't really work. Peripherals like mice and keyboards seem to function fine, but using Bluetooth headphones or a boombox is problematic. They will sync and begin working fine, but after a few minutes invariably they start skipping and it only gets worse from there. I troubleshot at length, different environments to control for interference, using multiple different devices, all from unique manufacturers, etc. Same thing no matter what. After doing some searching I learned that it is a known issue with some of the chromebooks, and that they are supposedly working on it, but with a nebulous due date on the patch. I don't expect them to ever fix it, but for me, it's not that big of a deal. I'm never far enough away from it to need Bluetooth, and my Galaxy S3 works just fine if I need some study jams.Overall - Great experience. I would have given 5 stars if not for the Bluetooth issue, as that is the only thing they promised, but didn't deliver. My Chromebook is constantly with me, at all times, and it really shines on the note-taking front. I'm one of the few people in the university to use a laptop of any kind to take notes, and it gives me the opportunity to grab a lot more information than those who are writing. I like being able to catch the little stories each prof tells about their experiences with x concept. I find these tidbits help me put a color on those ideas and remember them better.Tips for taking notes on the Chromebook: -Get familiar with the keyboard shortcuts specific to gdocs word processor. It will save you buckets of time. -If you have a chem-heavy curriculum try hitting Google images for molecular structures to save time. Just make sure it matches what Prof is doing on the board. -If you have a chem or math-heavy curriculum and need to use Greek and other letters like Sigma, Delta, or delta+/delta- frequently (thermodynamics, kinetics, intermolecular forces, etc.) make a table of all the applicable symbols and units (like kj/mol for instance) ahead of time, and paste it to the bottom of your notes before class starts. This way you can simply ctrl+c/ctrl+v (copy/paste) them into your notes without wasting time diving for them in the gdocs drop-downs. -Make some time after lab to rough-draft your report on campus in a computer lab. Or do it at home if you have access to MS Office. Don't waste your time trying to build lab reports unless they don't need graphs, or you and your lab partner(s) are both comfortable pulling up your gmail and running all your data in Google's spreadsheet software. (Could probably done. I'll report back if I even get a chance to try this.) -If you're re-writing notes in your own words for exams (which you definitely should be), rewrite them by hand.

Yes, backing it up is the name of the game with Windows, and something I do religiously, but there are always exceptions (one time both my hard drive and the external drive I had went kaput around the same time, causing me to lose a year's worth of docs). Now, I don't have to worry because not only is it in the cloud, it's also accessible anywhere I go on any computer. On the netbook, it's own app located on the taskbar so really easy to just click and start writing without any hassle of looking for it.(2) Search. This is something that not everyone will like because of how we've been trained, but the left enter button was changed into a search button, so whenever you hit it, a search box with apps menu pops up. It doesn't bother me because I\"m right handed and hit the right enter key with my pinky, but it might take some getting used to for lefties or people who use that particular button.(3) Chrome. I'm a big fan of this web browser already, so the ease of access just makes it even better for me. I have two separate Gmail accounts, and use both on the Chromebook., As a result, I have two different sets of apps and uses, much like Windows user accounts.(4) Battery life. My laptop is an Acer with only 4 hours of battery life, so I always have to carry a charger with me and hope I'm near a convenient socket to plug in. So far with this Chromebook, I've gone at least 8 hours with heavy use (I run an e-commerce store so I'm online constantly) and don't need to worry about the charge until I get home.(5) Browsing. I won't lie, this isn't the fastest I've ever used, but it works for what I need. Right now I have about 25 tabs open in 3 windows and haven't had any problems switching between them.Cons:(1) The keyboard. Now, this isn't really a big deal for me since I have small hands, but I know my boyfriend has problems typing on it, and I miss the side number keys.(2) Chromecast casting tab. Again, not a huge problem, but quality does suffer when I'm watching Amazon Prime shows while having a bunch of tabs open. (This only applies to people who own Chromecast so skip if you have no idea what I'm talking about).(3) Mouse. I've never liked touch pads and have always used wireless mice with my laptops. This time, however, I have opted to learn how to use it and for the most part I've learned to work with it, though I would recommend watching the tutorial or reading through the instructions to get full use out of it. Maybe with more practice this will turn from a con into a pro.I've only had this for a little over a week, so I haven't found more cons, but so far I really love this netbook because it does what I need it to do and gets it done with less hassle than Windows at a better price than even budget laptops.

It's super light weight, nicely priced, compact, has a full size keyboard and a nice sized screen, a welcome change from my android and Kindle Fire screen size.  It's a joy to use for typing documents and emails, and because of the size and feather weight I like to take it everywhere.  This was my definite go-to device on my last vacation.Unlike on my Dell laptop's touchpad, the touchpad on the Chromebook is actually nice to use. Once you go through a quick and easy tutorial, you realize it works like a charm.  I like the two-finger scrolling feature, and also how tapping the touchpad with 2 fingers has the same function as right-clicking on a mouse and other options. I find the touchpad to be quite responsive and ergonomically better for me than a mouse. I have never had a need to connect a mouse to the Chromebook, and that's a bonus since I like to travel light. I don't miss it, though if you want to plug in a mouse you can.My Dell laptop is sitting around collecting dust these days, but nice to know it's still there if I need it to do something more highpowered using software.  Frankly, I don't do much computing at home, and the chromebook works better, without the bulk and bog-down from software.  I expect Chromebooks will become even more high-powered in the future.  In the meantime this does what I like and I know automatic improvements are constantly being made behind the scenes.There have been some occasions when I've lost my house wifi and Sprint tower service to my android due to a wind storm and power outage.  I was able to quickly get back on line again with the 3G (via Verizon) feature and I still had 6 hrs of battery life to take advantage of.  It came in really handy in that emergency, and in places where I don't have wifi and really need to connect up for a bit. The 100 MB of included data per month isn't a lot, though I have yet to use up 100MB in a month's time. It's definitely an added convenience I'm glad I have. If I want more data temporarily, I can buy it. Haven't had to.I can surf the web, study for my exams, read kindle books, pdfs, read/write google docs, watch movies on Netflix, YouTube, play flash player content, and videos from a huge number of sites. Play with and create experimental apps, or download a huge number of proven  apps. Listen to my podcasts on Stitcher, Tune-in radio, connect to the ethernet too -- had to buy an adaptor for a few bucks. I can insert a memory card, connect a thumb drive to it, or my 1 TB backup drive to read, listen to or transfer files to or from.  I can store files in the cloud, or on the chromebook itself. I can also wirelessly transfer files via the Airdroid app.A few cons:I can connect the chromebook to my TV's hdmi, but I can't play Amazon instant videos, which is a shame.  Currently have to watch Amazon videos from my Dell laptop or my Kindle Fire (on the otherhand the Kindle Fire won't let me watch YouTube on hdmi, only on it's little screen, and it doesn't play flash content).(UPDATE!! You can now watch full length streaming Amazon instant videos. Previously only the short trailer versions of movies could be watched on the Chromebook. Thanks for paying attention to your reviewers Amazon and Chromebook!)Another thing I don't appreciate is that you can't make Skype calls from the Chromebook 11.6.  They do have the Google Hangouts app pre-loaded for making calls. I've never used it so can't comment on it, though I hear it works well for making video calls on the Chromebook.  I don't know if I will use it, will see.  I don't need another call app, another account to worry about.  I'll just use the Skype app on my android or computer.The good thing about Chromebook is that there are always changes and improvements being made behind the scenes.  For example, where previously Netflix wasn't available on this device just a few months ago, now it is.  I hope Amazon works with the manufacturer and makes their instant videos available on it too, (Update!: Previously only Amazon video trailers could be watched, Now Full length Amazon videos can be streamed!) and that Skype calls will also be able to be made from it.The other thing I miss is a back-lit keyboard when I'm in a dimly lit room. I realize that not having it saves battery life and that's a valid trade-off, though a lot of times I like to sit and work with it plugged in to power anyway. I think for future designs it would be nice to have the option to turn a keyboard back-light feature on or off. I guess I could clip on a book light so I can see the keyboard at those times, but that's just one more thing I have to cart around with me that I'd rather not.Overall I am extremely happy with my purchase, would highly recommend it, and expect I will get a lot of use out of it for quite some time to come.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "I will never buy another windows and/or mac again", "Author": "Thomas", "ReviewID": "R3ITFM0TVMAUJ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is my second chromebook, I own one of the original CR-48 beta chromebooks, I'll never buy another windows computer again and certainly wouldn't consider an overpriced underfeatured mac.

The setup for that machine was simpler than some tablets and phones - and the Chromebook setup was just as polished.I mainly use it to access my Google account - music and documents - and surf the Internet.

Yes, I can pin the dropbox WEBSITE to the taskbar and instant it easily (kind of like an easily accessible bookmark), but using it on this laptop is difficult and tedious. To get a file from dropbox, I must download it, which downloads to my computer's hard drive. Then, I have to upload it into Drive. If I try to open it right away, however, I can't edit. It opens it into a Viewer app which is the most unhelpful and irritating app on this device. So, I must open it manually into the Sheets app, which will let me edit. Then, after editing, I have to download the file as a proper .xls/.doc/.ppt to my computer's hard drive. This inevitably changes the file name, which I then have to manually rename so that it will replace the original file when I upload it to dropbox. Then, go back to the dropbox site and upload it, and it then syncs with my other devices. And of course the formatting is changed, so when I open it elsewhere, I either have to deal with ugly formatting or change it before I can use the document.Yes, I could use Drive, but this brings me to the next annoying part of Chrome OS:- Every file must be changed to Google's native file types before they can be added to Drive or used in any wayThis just adds another unnecessary step to everything, whether I want to upload to Dropbox or send the file to someone else.- Google Office apps are just inferiorThey are difficult to use, they unnecessarily have different file extensions that must be changed to use with Microsoft Office programs, and the formatting never looks as nice. There are also fewer options.- Every app requires internet connectivity to work fullyFor some reason, Google decided it would be a great idea to limit the functionality of its apps if the computer isn't connected to the internet. This means that if I'm making a slideshow online, I can't add a picture to my slides whatsoever. Even though I made to sure to add the image files to my computer the night before so that I could make the slideshow while I was at work where I am not lucky enough to have internet. Why?

I wanted to try it all, and see where my mobile needs led me.  Honestly, if I had bought this first, I'm not sure I would have bothered with the tablets.  Tablets are probably superior for games, and consuming entertainment media, which I can't do that much, due to limited internet access.  I love that I can sit on the porch and type away, or read the news, research topics of interest, and I don't have to hold the screen, as a tablet requires.  I didn't even bother to read the Quick Start Guide; the Chromebook just leads you along - and I'm barely tech literate.  As I needed to learn how to do things like Copy and Paste, access the Bookmarks bar, Zoom on the screen etc, I just 'Googled' my question to find the answer.  Google has made sure that detailed, clear and easy instructions are right there online, for all my questions so far.  I cannot believe that this tiny laptop was less than half the price of my 10 inch tablet.  I also bought a 32 GB SanDisk Cruzer Fit usb drive and it is so tiny you can barely see that it's inserted behind the hinge.  It's easy to be mobile with that little flash drive inserted - just leave it in.  I haven't tried an SD card yet, but I've read that it sticks out beyond the little door; too bad, it would be nice if it fit neatly inside, like a micro sd card does on a phone or tablet.  I am new to Googe Drive, but so far I love it.  I don't think I will use it for larger files like photos, because my internet is via my cell phone, and I have to watch my data consumption.  But for documents it's great; easy and accessible from all my devices.  All my old documents that happened to be in Google Docs magically appeared in the list!  Like old pals.  And even with Google Drive, you have the option of storing the documents on the usb drive.  The keyboard is a little harder touch than I'm used to, but I'm adapting quickly.  It's a nice keyboard; feels solid.  Battery life seems like it would be around 5 - 6 hours of continuous use.  I haven't really pushed it that far, but that's what the control panel is telling me, I think.  I haven't really explored all the available apps yet.

I'm talking about even just trying to watch videos on YouTube. It doesn't seem to process anything higher than 480p very well, and even that can be sketchy at times.When using Chrome Remote Desktop, you can access your home PC with all of its computing power using this chromebook.

For about $250, I was able to buy a laptop that was exactly what I needed. If you're the type of person who uses a computer to browse on the internet, or you're just a big Google fan, then you are going to love the Chromebook. As a student, I don't bring my Chromebook to school because we're given cheap laptops to use. So, in terms of assignments and such, I use Google Drive to make documents like writing papers, essays, etc. This way I can start an assignment at school and without having to transport a laptop I can access and finish that same assignment at home on my Chromebook. Yes, you can do this with laptops other than the Chromebook, but I still wanted to make that point.  If you're looking for a laptop that has all the bells and whistles that an overpriced Apple product may provide, then you may want to reconsider the Chromebook. Before buying mine, I often found myself comparing the Samsung Chromebook with the Apple Macbook Air, even though I'm not an Apple fan (that's a whole other story) and the fact that these two laptops are in totally different leagues. I do admit, though, that the Apple Macbook Air is a very nice product in terms of design and what not, but it seemed that it had too much for what I really needed because I was just looking for a laptop that I could use to go on Facebook, check my email, etc. I did look at a few tablets, but I wanted to be able to do school work so a keyboard was definitely needed. Since my purchase, I've found that the Chromebook is really just a tablet with a keyboard which was perfect! Although dubbed a laptop, the Chromebook acts like a tablet due to the fact that you have applications, which you can easily access from the Chrome Web Store and/or Google Playstore, and it has limited space on the computer itself (although you can always store files on Google Drive). However, you can do things on the Chromebook that you can't on a tablet. For instance, my Dad owns a tablet and when trying to access Hulu, it requires that you have Hulu Plus to watch its content while the Chromebook doesn't have a problem. I know this may not be a defining factor in considering what you want, but for me that was pretty important.  When I first bought this laptop, Netflix initially didn't work on Chromebooks. Since then, the problem has been fixed and I've been using Netflix steadily for the past few months.  In terms of the laptop itself, and not on what it does, I've had absolutely no problems with the design. I really like the keyboard, where all letters are in lowercase (neat and different than those of other laptops), a search key replaces the standard caps lock key, and you have all the \"shortcut keys\" at the very top of the keyboard with options like full screen, brightness, sound, refresh button, and multiple tabs key. The keyboard is really nice, though my only complaint would be that the keys don't light up in the dark so if you're using the Chromebook in an area of limited light, then you have to use the light from the screen to see what you're typing. The mouse is really easy to use, you can scroll up and down pages by using two fingers on the mouse pad. The screen isn't glossy like the Macbook Air, but I found that its matte finish is much better because you don't have as much reflection on the screen. The speaker quality is pretty decent for its size and for having the speakers be on the bottom of the laptop (but the curvature design of the bottom makes it so it doesn't get too muffled). Although the laptop can be easily susceptible to scratches, it still has a sleek design and finish and I honestly don't mind the scratches on mine because I didn't buy it for what it looks like but more of what it can do.  There is a standard 3.5 mm audio input on the side with usb ports, hdmi cable port, and charger port on the back. There's also a decent front facing camera, but if you're one to take selfies, I advise that you use a cell phone or an actual camera if you want the best quality. The laptop is incredibly light and it really does turn on in less than 10 seconds, so if a restart is needed for an update and such, it doesn't take much time to do so.  SUMMARY: I didn't mean to go so in depth, but I honestly was so excited to write this review because I've been praising my Chromebook for the past 6 months and figured it was time to tell the world. If you are looking for a laptop primarily for internet use then don't look any farther because the Chromebook is perfect for you. It's light, and with a case you can take it just about anywhere. It really does turn on in about 8 seconds, so they weren't lying. The battery lasts for hours, so I don't need to recharge that often. However, because of its unique operating system and being heavily focused on using wi-fi, if you don't have wireless, then the Chromebook will be pretty useless. Yes, there are some offline apps you can use, but let me repeat, only some.  SUMMARY OF SUMMARY (this is it, I promise): Samsung claims that their Chromebook is for everyone but it definitely isn't. Before buying mine, I did a LOT of research and took a chance on the Chromebook and I have been very happy with it so far.

For web based browsing activities, this device is perfect.  I like the fact that it weighs so little (about 2 lbs) and is therefore very portable, unlike some laptops that basically are like lugging a \"desktop laptop\".  Unlike my previous computer, this computer stays relatively cool and warms up only when the outside temperature is warm (~80 F).There is one major limitation of the chromebook:  the relative incompatibility with Microsoft Office files.  While the chrome browser allows reading of these documents, you cannot edit them with this laptop.  Luckily there are two ways to get around this:  SkyDrive and Chrome Remote Desktop.  SkyDrive is the Microsoft version of Google Drive and as you can imagine, it allows you to store your Office documents (.docx, .xlsx, etc) in the cloud and edit them.  With Chrome Remote Desktop, you can control one of your Windows or Mac machines that has Office installed.Storage is minimal on the device, but since Google Drive recently consolidated both Gmail and Drive storage, you now get up to 30 GB of cloud storage, which is probably enough for most web based and document uses.  I personally have a 1 TB external hard drive for physical copies of my documents as well,The battery life is amazing, by far, for any of the laptops that I have owned to this point.  I always used to have to worry about bringing the laptop charger around wherever I brought the laptop.  Not with this chromebook.  Battery life is at least 5 hours, though this is highly dependent on usage patterns and whether or not you have USB devices plugged in, as these draw power from the computer.Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase of this device.

It was a cool experience, but Chrome OS was so young then. It was just a fullscreen browser. It's come a long way since 2010.Chrome OS is a great operating system once you shake off your perceived need for a \"regular\" operating system. If you are a designer, programmer, artist, gamer, or video editor, you can't use this as your main computer. If you're a regular consumer who browses the web, watches videos, uses social networking sites, chats with friends, and plays the occasional casual game, there's nothing wrong with Chrome OS. Google is even slowly introducing some cool features that can be activated if you're into poking around (in chrome://flags). These features range from multitasking gestures (here now but experimental) and animations to Google Now and notification syncing (not available yet but there is evidence of their existence in the Flags page.Something worth noting is that this particular Chromebook has an ARM processor, like a tablet or smartphone, or Microsoft's Surface RT. More recently, developers have been creating apps for Chrome OS that run on what is called, \"Native Client\" which is basically a local program like what you would install on any other computer. Most of those will not run on this machine. They should run on any Chromebook with an Intel processor, but none of the developers have compiled their software to run on ARM processors.For non-computer geeks and computer science majors: ARM processors communicate in a language that programs written for Intel processors don't \"speak\".I bought one of these Chromebooks without knowing how many native client apps I would actually try to install. Most are games, so it's not the end of the world, but it's a disappointment. The Acer C7 is cheaper but less attractive, has a fan, is thicker, and has about half the battery life of this Samsung model.The Samsung Chromebook is made of very cheap plastic (it's a $250 computer after all) that will scuff immediately if you put it in a backpack with anything else. I put mine in a bag with three children's books from the library and they scuffed the lid pretty badly. Otherwise it's not too flimsy and doesn't feel that cheap. I've seen some Windows laptops with really flimsy cases. The keyboard and touchpad are actually really good for the price too. No complaints there. The keys are spaced adequately and aren't too high or too low for me. The touchpad is responsive and not a pain to use. This Chromebook does have a matte display though, which is a pro or con for you depending on your preferences. I used to be anti-matte displays but I got used to it.As for the operating system, I've grown accustomed to it after a few months and I have no reason to go back to Windows, Mac OS, or a desktop Linux OS.

I heard about the Series 3 Chromebook update, and swung by my local big box retailer to pick one up and see what it was capable of.The CPU in this thing is less powerful than the CPU in my smartphone, and it's got less RAM. It's only been three days, and I'm logged into the corporate VPN, SSH sessions are active to the servers I'm working on, and I've got Spotify leaking out my headphones. Admittedly, I had to enable Developer mode to get the Cisco VPN client installed, since there's not a supported AnyConnect client for Chrome OS yet, but I wanted more Linux features anyway for work. Netflix still works, HBO Go still works, color me impressed.I own a Sony Xperia Z SGP311U1/B 10.1-Inch 16GB Tablet and I feel more concerned hauling that thing around, and I'm less productive on it. With the Chromebook's full keyboard, I can code to my little heart's content all the livelong day. I can touch-type notes in meetings instead of having to eyeball the touchscreen to make sure I'm poking the right screen region (or without the bother of carrying a bluetooth keyboard).The last time I was this happy hauling a computer around was with the Dell Mini 9, and the keyboard on that thing was so tiny it hurt my wrists to type on it after an hour. The Chromebook's keyboard is roughly the same size as the Apple Wireless Keyboard MC184LL/B, and although it doesn't have the same soft chiclet keys, the keyboard is quite responsive and natural to use.A note on utility: I am recommending that my parents replace their desktop and kitchen notebook with Series 3 Chromebooks (or maybe Series 5 after the update). With SkyDrive, they can have the familiar Microsoft Office experiences through the web interface, and everything else is already accessible through the Chrome browser. My mother preferred the weight of the Chromebook to the weight of her 4th gen iPad, and liked that she could type using the familiar keyboard. I handed the Chromebook after a factory reset with no instructions and she was browsing within 5 minutes, using all the sites she uses with her iPhone, iPad, and desktop. They don't do anything intensive enough that they'd need anything more powerful than the ARM chip, and if there was a scenario where full x86 compatibility was required, the Series 5 is also reasonable. The Series 3 is just so astoundingly portable, though, that I am happy to move all my processor-intensive work to another machine, maybe even using Chrome Remote Desktop to the M4600 to run some of the Enterprise applications if our Security folks decide to allow that. Either way, I am quite pleased with the Series 3.If you are considering one, I'd recommend just purchasing it.

I think I can do 95% of what I need armed with this Chromebook and my S3 phone. If you have a nice, portable laptop dedicated to home use, I can imagine that the Chromebook would be less appealing than a tablet. Tablets are nicer for bed use and reading in my opinion. The Chromebook really acts as my home laptop and I doubt I would have considered it if I had one. But it's a perfect solution if you don't.", "Date": "May 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Unbeatable for the Price", "Author": "Benjamin", "ReviewID": "R1MJZLSWHJAN93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am currently a student at a University and this is the perfect computer for me. I already have a HP Envy 14 which I have used most of the year because I have not had my desktop, and although a great computer, is way too heavy and large for my uses. I just recently found out about this Chromebook and after watching a few reviews, I bought one used for $170.It is seriously the best $170 I have ever spent.Pros: This computer is incredibly fast due to its SSD and I love it. It will start up in seconds and wake up from hibernating in even fewer seconds. The matte screen is perfect as it gets surprisingly bright and due to its matte finish, is one of the best computers I have used outdoors or in window light ever. The brightness auto adjusts as well which is an awesome feature. The battery life is really amazing as I have never had an electronic that lasts as long as this one does. The keyboard feels smooth and the keys press very nicely. The hot keys on the top are convenient and although I don't use them all, the brightness and volume ones are used frequently every day. The computer weighs next to nothing and is also really thin, Although the computer is made of plastic and would be much better if it was aluminum,holds together just fine. The headphone jack is located on the left side of the computer towards the back and I have found this spot to be incredibly convenient.Cons (more so my dis-likings about the Chromebook): One thing that people need to know is that without Ubuntu installed on this laptop, it cannot run things offline very well. You can access Google Docs offline, but you can't necessarily run programs. When ever you open a music player or something, it opens up into a window. This computer only runs a browser,and that is it. Don't expect to be able to install Microsoft word on this computer or any other program without dual booting Ubuntu. The trackpad clicks easier towards the bottom when compared to the top, and I wish that it had the same amount of pressure needed at the top as well as the bottom. On the back of the computer the hinge sticks our which makes the computer excessively larger towards the end - I feel like this computer would look so much more sleek with it built in rather than being on the outside. Occasionally when I run a YouTube video and leave it to go to another tab, the video will begin to skip but this is not really that big of a problem.One thing I would advise people to do to take complete advantage of this computer would be to look into installing Ubuntu onto it so you can run Microsoft Word-like programs, photo software, etc. When I press 4 keys down, my Chromebook switches to Ubuntu and I am able to use this Chomebook as if it were are full fledged laptop. Because (most) everything on this computer is saved to Google Drive, if you mess up while installing Ubuntu you can just factory reset the laptop and everything is back to normal.Regardless of installing Ubuntu on here or not, I would advise everyone who wants to buy this computer and use it for internet and papers/spreadsheets/etc to BUY IT. It is fast, light, flawless, and beautiful. In today's age, WiFi is everywhere and chances are you spend a lot of your time on the computer browsing the internet. For $800 less than a Macbook Air you can get everything that it has (will Ubuntu installed) on a laptop that is almost as beautiful as a Macbook AIr. I would be happy to buy another one and will continually recommend this Laptop to people.If you have WiFi, mainly use your computer for internet browsing and working on papers/spreadsheets/etc, buy this computer. With and install of Ubuntu, you can have Photo editing software as well as many other programs such as a Microsoft-Word-mimic (Libre Office).

I don't think they understand the Chromebook.The Samsung Chromebook is a great little computer.  It is lightweight, and it is tough.  The Chrome OS currently does everything I want.  If you have good Internet access, it leverages that into remarkable capabilities and blazing speed.  When you don't have Internet access, it behaves like any old dull computer.  It still does word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations and stores them locally.  There is no disk drive to fragment or to fail.Because the Chrome OS really lives on the Web, it is automatically updated without intervention from you.  It is invulnerable to viruses.  So you do not need to have antivirus software slowing you down and emptying your wallet.  It automatically saves all documents as you work.  You cannot fail to save something.  Software updates, both OS and applications, are free and automatic.It is not going to run your Windows or MacOS or Linux software.  So if you run your business on your computer, the Chromebook may not be a good match.  If you live on the Internet, like me, it is perfect.  It costs half as much as an Ipad, and it has a real keyboard.  It boots from \"power off\" to log in in six seconds and to operational in four more.  The case is plastic.  (I do not remember the last laptop I had that had a metal case, but I am not a Mac guy.)  I dropped it on my hardwood floor, and it bounced pretty well.

About 1 days time and I can already type faster and more accurately than on my other. I am actually typing on it now and when possible I try to type all my documents on the Chrome Book. One final point, the battery life is awesome. I generally get about 6 hrs browsing the internet and streaming Pandora. It slightly decreases when streaming Netflix but thats to be expected. If I am just typing a document I can get 7+ and without wi-fi on (rare) I have had 10 hrs. The setup of the laptop is very nice and is a great second laptop.

I needed something smaller, lighter, and with a better battery life. While I would love a macbook air, I'm not in a position to spend $1200 for a device at this time. That's when I started looking at Chromebooks. The only hangup I had was that I had to be online to get any use out of it, and then I realized that I am always online. It takes a little bit to get it set up the way I wanted it but after that it does everything I need it to, I can even access my iCloud account online and update my to do list and calendar.  Well, almost. There are certain test that I have to take for school that I need a regular PC for, and then there is my iTunes account. For those I use my laptop at home. Even then I can remotely access my computer from anywhere. I love writing on it, the keyboard is very good. I used it on a trip to DC, and was able to get work done on the train gong up and back. The fact that I usually only charge it at night like a cell phone is a plus.  I will warn anyone who is considering buying one that this is not for those who need to replace their powerful PC, the lack of significant hardrive space and Chrome's limited OS will frustrate someone coming from a Macbook pro or other $1000 computer. This is for those who are already comfortable working in the cloud, or need a small, light, second computer with a great battery. If that's you then I highly recommend it.  As far as word processing goes, I have a skydrive account. I can access all of my documents, open them with the online version of Microsoft office. I'm a creature of habit and I don't like Google docs for daily use. I'm not really big photo social media guy, I only use Linked in and Facebook so I cannot speak to that for anyone. If I listen to music I use Google play and synced all of my iTunes music to it so I have access to everything I own. I rarely use the speakers, I prefer headphones as I am often out in public. I don't watch movies on the Chromebook, I only watch lectures for school and they are usually of poor video quality to begin with. If I'm gonna watch a movie I'll watch it on my HD tv at home, never really understood the need to watch movies on tiny screens. (I know I'm a boring old man).

The Chromebook has no hard drive, just a small flash memory with room for it\u2019s Google operating system (similar to Android)  and any of the apps you choose from the small list available.  So everything you do has to be done via the Cloud. Specifically Google Docs, Spreadsheet and Presentation \u2014 now all part of Google Drive.

You can link it by wire to your internet modem and there is a 3G/WIFI version but if you have WIFI in the house or visit Starbucks, McDonalds or live in a digitally connected town, it works wonderfully.

I previously had a Macbook Air that recently died a bit prematurely, so I thought I would give this Chromebook a shot.Firstly, I really like the size of the laptop.  It's very small and lightweight, and yet the keyboard and trackpad feel really good.  I am very picky about my laptop trackpads, having been spoiled by my Air.  Most Windows laptops have horrible trackpads and I was very concerned about going to this one.  However, the accuracy is excellent and the gestures are pretty good.  I don't think they are quite up to par with the Macs, but for this price point the trackpad is better than Windows laptops that are three times this price.As far as the operating system itself, color me impressed.  I was a user of Google Chrome already and heavily invested into Google web apps, so that transition wasn't hard at all.  I did find myself looking for some viable Chrome-based alternatives to software that I used on my PC, like a VNC client.  To date, I haven't found a single piece of software that I need on a daily basis on a laptop that doesn't have a Chrome app for it.The only negative thing I can say is that the ARM processor in this guy can sometimes get a little sluggish on graphically intensive pages, but mostly it's smooth.  High definition video is just fine most of the time, but some pages can still slow it down to a crawl.  I have tweaked a couple of settings and blocked some web elements from loading and that seemed to improve it greatly.  I definitely recommend this Samsung Chromebook and Chrombooks in general.  I will probably grab another one when the Haswell updates come out.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A must have for a student!!!", "Author": "Malarie Williams", "ReviewID": "R2EPQJIXLVCMOG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As I read the various reviews about the the Samsung Chromebook I must admit that I was quite skeptical. First of all, I have never really owned anything by Samsung. Actually, I thought Samsung was quite inferior to the other brands out there, but I will say that my opinion has changed completely. A month ago I was experiencing some problems with my desktop so I bought this Chromebook as a cheap solution...and I absolutely love it. It is very lightweight. I love that it doesn't have any fans, so there is no fear of it overheating. I've not had any trouble logging onto any websites. Believe me, I'll let Netflix play all night and I have not had any issues with the it cutting off at all. The volume is very very nice. The screen is average. The size is great for handling.The keys are soundless. Every now and then the Chromebook will shutdown on its own in order to update everything, but it's very rare and it saves absolutely everything. Unfortunately, my only real complaint about the Chromebook is that the cover must have been made out of very cheap material because I've only had it for a month and there are scratches all over the top. However, Samsung sells these really cool protective skins. I found some at Decalgirls.com for like 20 bucks and they work really really well. (AND NO, THEY AREN'T JUST FOR GIRLS< YOU CAN CUSTOMIZE THEM HOWEVER YOU LIKE). I would not advise an older, working individual to buy one simply because this is more fit for college students. It is no different from an Ipad, but you cannot treat it as an apple product. Samsung WILL NOT cooperate with Itunes, but you already know that. Of course, you need the internet for absolutely everything on it. As a college student, I need the internet daily anyways so that isn't an issue for me.  All in all, the Samsung Chromebook is cheap, yet has great features on it. If you're already thinking about it, my advice is to just go for it.", "Date": "September 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not enough travel in the keys and trackpad tough to use", "Author": "DesertDweller", "ReviewID": "R3MURTE6H20818", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I think the idea behind this device  is great, to have a system that is pared down and just for Internet, email, watching non-HD videos on Youtube, and the like.  I am using a netbook that I bought 3 years ago, using WinXP,and it has slowed down badly over time.  Can't even play Youtube videos without stuttering any more, sometimes to the point where I give up trying to watch.  If the chromebook can deliver a device that won't have that problem, I'd love it.  So that's why I bought it.  The execution of the idea, I found, has a couple issues.  First, I had some difficulties with the keyboard and trackpad.  And then I found out that the particular device I had is defective.  Those two issues are discussed in more detail, in the next two paragraphs.I only used this device for a few hours last evening, when it functioned normally.  It was pretty nice then, with a nice bright screen and everything very intuitive and easy to use.  On the downside, I thought the cursor movement in response to the trackpad was a bit slow, even after I found the \"settings\" and set it for max speed.  Also, Chrome doesn't seem to have a setting that makes the cursor fly all the way to the edge of a window once you have set it in motion, which you get with Windows.  The cursor only moves as long as your finger is in contact with the trackpad and moving.  However, the trackpad does have 2-finger scrolling, and a tap with 2 fingers gives you a \"right click,\" which are nice features.  I was going to keep the device and study up on all the features, and I figured it would get easier for me to use with practice on this particular keyboard and trackpad.Unfortunately, this morning I discovered that my unit is defective.  On the third boot-up, the trackpad had stopped working.  The cursor would barely respond, if at all, to finger movements across the trackpad.  Samsung customer service is good, BTW (this is my 2d Samsung laptop).  I got them on the phone, and these were the troubleshooting steps they had me try:  (1) re-boot - which I had already tried before phoning them, (2) tap the \"escape\" key several times - no change there (3) do a \"drumroll\" with two fingers on the trackpad - no joy (4) do a factory reset, using the following keys, held down together:  Shift - Ctrl - Alt - R.  After the factory reset (which the Chromebook calls a \"powerwash\") the trackpad became responsive for a minute or two.  But before I could even get back to connecting with my wifi, it cut out again.Bottom line:  I would have liked to use this device for a longer period of time before reviewing it.  Based on what I was able to do with it, I felt it was about a 3 - 4 because of my criticisms of the keyboard and trackpad that I wrote in paragrah 2.  In light of the defect in this example of the system, I'm going with 3 stars.  I'll send this back for refund, and apply the money to getting a PC or Mac.  I'm glad there is a 3d choice out there now, but at the moment I guess it is not for me.Edit, later on: I didn't get the device packed up and sent back right away, so I gave it one more chance last evening. Starting over from the most recent reset to factory settings, I used it to edit text, happily, for a few hours. I take back what I said about \"not enough travel in the keys.\" I seem to have adjusted, and the typing was OK. BUT, once the power got low enough for the device to prompt me to plug it in - bam, as soon as I plugged in the power supply, the trackpad stopped working properly again. So today, the device went back to Amazon, for credit.

It's not too big, nor too small, to handle my larger hands. The keyboard is laid out well and provides comfort.2) The screen is matted (which I prefer) and provides an easy viewing.3) The weight is amazing.

It's a very similar experience from my MacBook Air -- chiclet style keys with a good \"pop.\" The only downside is that the shortcut keys on the top row are arranged different from my MBA. I find myself accidentally hitting the 'back' and 'forward' button on the Chromebook while trying to dim the screen and so on.My Favorites:Music/Cloud SyncDuring my undergrad years I was a huge music snob (oh university radios) and had accumulated tons of music. It was a nightmare trying to transfer them whenever I would upgrade laptops. I tried lugging around a external HDD large enough, but found myself defeating the whole point of having a laptop. I was really glad when Google Music offered 20,000 songs (I was at about 19,000, I hope they'll allow more in the future) as I can have access to my music collection wherever I go. The Google Music App with my iPhone works well with my unlimited Data plan from StraightTalk.. I really don't know the last time I actually synced music files onto it! I do notice that the music player plug in will crash on the Chromebook if I pause and resume too quickly.Apple's iDrive or iCloud or ... iWhatever was always so confusing to me. 'Oh it's called iDrive now? Wait now I have 10gb allotted for pictures? Huh?' whereas Google it just synced everything on its own. I was fortunate enough to have a Legacy Plan so I'm not worried on running out of space any time soon. Also the additional 100GB/2years included was a pleasant surprise. The best part was that the Google Drive space is independent of my music collection! I'm a hobby photographer so it's nice to know that my pictures are safe floating around in the cloud space.I dug around and found that my Legacy plan will stay intact after the 2 years, and if I have accessed the free 100GB, those files will still be available with the caveat that I won't be able to add more files to my Gdrive. Unless I pay for additional space of course.I have an iPhone that I changed to use Chrome by default via Cydia. I love that it syncs all my bookmarks and surfing history across my gear. I briefly had a Nexus 4, but had to stick with the iPhone because most of my medical software are on iOS only. It wasn't a preference of brands, I just want convenience as my backpack gets more full with each new gadget out on the market!Documents/Office ProductivityI also find myself no longer dependent on thumb drives. I work as a researcher for a hospital so I'm constantly hopping back and forth free computers to enter in data or make corrections. We recently made the jump to Google Docs so that we can all edit documents simultaneously. Before this, if someone had left a certain document open on the network, others would not be able to edit it. A huge hassle as a witch hunt would ensue to find which \"n00b\" left the document open. Oh lab grunts.Cons:Netflix/AVI playbackLike others have mentioned, Netflix is still not available on this certain model. I hope it gets fixed soon!AVI playback seems hit or miss for meConclusion:So I had bought this on a whim, the price tag was really appealing and I bought it as a toy. Little did I know it would become part of my professional life.I wish I had waited for the 3G model, 100mb/month doesn't seem much but I could see it being extremely handy in a cinch.

I make my living off the Internet and was working within 5 minutes of taking my SC out of the box. I can't add anything more than all the previous posters have so I'll leave a few tips & tricks:ALT + backspace is the delete keyIf Hulu is jerky set Hulu to HIGH, not HD or AUTO. Netflix is on the way. YouTube works fine.The screen is fine - gets better with use. If you stand to either side of the SC or hang from your chandelier you can't see the image but I don't stand to the side and I hate chandeliers so I sit in front of all my devices and in that position the screen on the SC is fine. It would be nice if Sammy or Google would add a contrast slider as that would bring out the image.I never liked standalone progs so have been in the cloud before it was named the cloud. I put everything up on Google Drive and it all seems to work fine - films stream okay on the SC, music sounds good, images look cool, docs appear as they should. Put Google Drive on all your devices and you'll have global access to all your stuff. I haven't used SD cards, thumb drives, etc on the SC as I'll either temporarily copy something over (like a film I want to watch on a trip somewhere) or leave it on the Drive.Sound is good - I think the SC has a spatializer because it gives a surround sound effect out of 2 small speakers. Sound is really good with headphones or through a speaker systemA light touch on the touch pad works for me - real gentle. Once you get used to using 2 fingers for certain options you'll be zipping around.Connection to WiFi was instant for me - I know some have had problems. I set up my printer connected to my Windows desktop on Google Cloud Print a few months ago during an idle moment so was pleasantly surprised when I was able to print immediately from my SC.It's cute but it's plastic so keep that in mind if you're going out & about and don't leave it anywhere it can be sat on. My Sammy netbook could probably take being sat on, my Sammy Chromebook - well, I think not, so be warned.That's all I can think of.

I'm using it even more often than I thought I would.  I have a high end desktop with a linux OS, a Dell laptop with Win7, a Nexus 7 and this Chromebook.  So far, the Chromebook is getting the most use.  The form factor, long battery life, full-fledged browser, and instant on make this device more compelling than the others.  I had considered buying a MacBook Air to use as a \"couch computer\" but this one does the job for a quarter of the price.  Note that I didn't say it does everything the Air does, because it doesn't, but it does all the things I was going to do with the Air.I think it's better to compare this Chromebook to mobile devices rather than to a full-fledged laptop, even though I'm using it more like a laptop.

Still, in the last 24 hours, I've found this computer to be everything that I thought it would be. My expectations for this were that it would be a very good second computer (I have a four year old MacBook which is still in good working condition, though its diminished battery life makes it impractical to take places), and those expectations have been met and exceeded.The Good:-This laptop is just as thin and light as I thought it would be. It's very easy to carry around in my messenger bag, and feels solid enough to survive any bumps my bag might have. Its portability was a very important factor in my decision to purchase this laptop, and it has been absolutely on point with my expectations. It's half the weight of my MacBook and probably a third of the weight of my work laptop (which I have to carry to and from home on a daily basis), so it's actually quite a delight to not have to carry around something that heavy.-The keyboard is large enough to type on with relative ease. I'm a bigger guy, and sometimes typing on a laptop can be a chore for me, but I don't find this to be any more difficult than my MacBook (which was $900 more). However, for what I need this for (I'm returning to school in the fall for my doctorate, so a small and portable computer to take notes on is essential for me) it is perfect. I've even used it to take notes on a call at work today, and the keys are relatively quiet and my typing wasn't disruptive to my call today at all.-Getting used to using only Chrome Apps (even coming from someone who used Chrome before) has taken a brief time to get used to, but now that I'm a little more familiar with the operating system, I find it to be very user friendly and entirely intuitive. Plus, with all the apps and extensions that are available in the Chrome Web Store, it's possible to customize it to where it fits my needs and desires.-I've moved most of my music from my MacBook (almost 3,000 songs) into the cloud, and I've had no problems listening to it on my Chromebook. The speakers being on the bottom do make the sound a little muffled when it's resting on my lap, but I have a lap desk that I used with my MacBook often and when it's resting on that, the sound is great. The speakers are quite loud when they are at full blast,and so I have no issues hearing anything. I've watched a few videos and they are just fine as well.-The screen is very similar to both my work computer and my old MacBook, so I don't have the same point of reference that some other posters have. For me, it's almost exactly what I'm already used to, so I have no issues at all with it. It's bright enough for me even in high light environments, and works fantastic in low light settings. It is a little smaller than I'm used to, but I knew the size going into this and it's not an issue either.-Battery life has been good so far. I did charge it a little today while I was at work, but I've been working and playing around on it for about two and a half hours now, and the battery meter says that I still have over three and a half hours left to go, so this is in line with the six hour per charge estimate that is given. I'm sure if I decreased the brightness I could save a little more battery life, but I'm pleased with the level of illumination and it's worth it to me to sacrifice the extra battery time.-Getting the 100gb of free cloud storage was entirely painless.-As other people have posted, the boot time is incredibly fast. Switching between users (I have seperate personal and professional Google accounts) is also painless and quick.The Bad:-The trackpad is not something I'm used to. I don't know if it's just that my other laptops are older and have less sophisticated trackpads, but I had to disable the touch to click feature (I kept accidentally clicking things while I was trying to scroll) but at least that's a feature that's available. Also, the trackpad requires a much lighter touch than I'm used to (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's something to consider if you're used to having to apply a modicum of pressure to the trackpad on other laptops). It's taking some getting used to, but I worry that switching between machines will make this a little more difficult for me.-That's about it (for me at least).Bottom Line:There are parts of this laptop that I haven't fully explored yet, but I've found it to be everything I wanted it to be and more. Again, I'm not a power user, so for me this is perfect for the things I need it to do. It's easily portable, super easy to use and it's fast and responsive. Overall I rated this five stars because it has met and exceeded my expectations quite nicely. If you're looking for a second computer (one to just keep around the couch or take with you on trips) this is an excellent investment, particularly for the low price.You should definitely think about getting one.

The only reason for this is because playing Angry Birds and a few other games in the App Store is a little choppy. Also I tried to play a 300mg video file locally instead of via the web and it took 4-5 min to load. After that it would only play sound and not display video. For those 2 reasons I could not give it 5 stars.Having said that, am I no way disappointed with this device, as I am currently driving down the road connected to my phone writing this review. (I should prolly clarify say that I wasnt actually driving. My wife was and I was in the passenger seat. Apparently some people are dumb enough to think otherwise.......) The touchpad is great, however it did take me a few min to get used to the gestures that I am not used to. (2 finger swipe and the touchpad actually clicks) This is a very nice compact machine. I will feel so much more comfortable carrying this around school as opposed to my 2000 Alienware laptop...Much more portable.I have heard people complain about the display and it not being bright enough, however it is a sunny day as we drive down the road and I can see the screen very clear.The Keyboard is top notch and the star of this device. While made entirely of plastic it does feel cheap at all. I am comfortable picking it up by the corner without a fear of it breaking. Connecting to a TV via the HDMI is as simple as plugging it in. If Google can fix the local playback issue and get the few games such as Angry Birds to play better, then I would for sure give this thing 5 stars.If you have a need for portability and a cloud based device, this is the device for you, especially with it being priced at $249.", "Date": "November 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "perfect low priced ultra portable laptop", "Author": "mspice", "ReviewID": "R3NOY0ONR84JSM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a heavy laptop user and software developer.

It seems very easy to break because of how light it is. The keys are very soft and I love it. The webcam is very clear and fun to play around with. This laptop revolves around Google and ONLY Google. Hence the Google Chrome browser that comes with it. That's one thing I dislike about it, not being able to download anything other than Google. I'm a gamer and this laptop isn't suitable for games due to not having the right file type but other than that, it is perfect for traveling. I also got confused about downloading apps when I first opened it. The instructions and help papers that comes with it does not explain very well either. It's mostly in Chinese.

I'm in my fourth year of college and this laptop is great for school if you don't want to spend the money for an expensive macbook. The battery lasts about 6 - 7 hours so no need to worry if you can't find a plug in class. The computer is small and light weight which is easy to take in a backpack. I am probably impressed by this laptop so much because previously I had a 17\" laptop, which was a pain in the butt to take to school and use for notes with only 2 hours of battery.Another upside, which kinda goes with the whole school thing is the one sign in chrome account. If you want to search the web for articles, school work, checking email, watching youtube or netfix, pretty much anything that is basic, AND you want a cheap computer than this is a great device. If I write out a paper for school and need to print it on a school computer then I can just log in to gmail and access it on my google drive, which you get free space when you buy a chromebook.Easy google store. It is also nice to have every program available through the chrome store. Instead of paying a bunch of money for specific programs you can just download the app through the google play store, which I might add is always being updated and added to all the time and will be for years.EASY TO USE! I am actually really good with computers, and I have a job where I sit down with customers every day at my university and help them figure out their computer issues. With that in mind, if you are one of those people who do not understand technology, you find it confusing, this laptop would be great for you. Everything that you need to access you can put it on your bar. Want to get to netflix, pandora, a spreadsheet, or gmail? For some of these you have to download the link in the app store (which is easy), and then it's on your bar and you can one click access these sites with lovely icons that look like an app on your phone. Let's say you are someone who is not a fast learner when it comes to using technology. If you go onto the customer service site, they have videos that show step by step instructions on how to use all of the features on the chromebook. No longer will you have to ask your 8 year old child or grandchild to show you how to use technology, because now you can just look up videos.CONSThere is always pros and cons to everything and although this computer is great, I still have issues.Screen flickering. I've looked it up on the forums. I recently just got this laptop and have been experiencing flickering since I first got it. I will be trying to resolve this issue shortly, but apparently it is a common and known issue, so just keep this in mind that you might get a computer with screen flickering. I have a friend who has this same exact laptop and she has never gotten screen flickering and hers is about a year old, mine is about 2 months. Also keep in mind that this is flickering even when I am not touching the screen panel or any of the wires connected, so most likely it is a software issue. Maybe I will update this once I find a solution, no promises though :PSOUNDFor the most part the speakers are great. Especially in pandora, youtube, and sometimes netflix. BUT.....BUT when you are on websites that does not have self regulated volume controls then there is a problem. What I mean by volume controls is for example the volume control on pandora, where you can make the volume much louder. Netflix will sometimes have movies or shows that are much quieter, usually documentaries, and even when I have Netflix volume cranked up and the speakers volume cranked up I still cannot hear what is being said. I have also read online that this is a common issue. Although this just seems to be poor placement for the speakers as well as cheaper speakers since the  computer is so cheap.All in all it is a great laptop and I don't have much issues with it. For the price it is definitely worth it, especially if you are in school or need a computer to travel with you a lot that you just need for most basic functions.Oh also I should note that you can torrent... not that I would do that because it is illegal. For those of you curious there is an app call JStorrent that seems to work well..... or so I've heard. There are youtube videos that say how to use it. Just keep in mind that you can really only torrent one thing at a time and it is not going to be ridiculously fast... I mean it's not super slow or anything, a windows or mac computer (depending on how old it is) will be much faster.Hope this review helps you with your purchasing needs!

This Chromebook is powered by an ARM processor that isn't as powerful as the one in the Acer c720 (a Chromebook that comes in at a very similar price point than this one). The Samsung Chromebook has been a travelers paradise; no longer do I have to carry around a honking 6lbs laptop or its heavy charger. The Samsung Chromebook gives me an average of about 6 hours of usage, which is more than enough for what I need to use it for away from home. It also provides these modest hours while being completely silent, a trait that can be attributed to the ARM processor inside, as well as the lightweight Chrome OS (which made running an ARM processor in the first place entirely possible).The keyboard is absolutely fantastic to type on and the trackpad is large and spacious. I was the type that would carry around an external mouse to be used for my laptop, big emphasis on WAS. Not only is the trackpad eons more responsive than on my Windows laptop, but it also works with some of Chrome OS's unique trackpad gestures. ChromeOS has a very short learning curve if you use Google Chrome as your primary browser on your current device and a moderate one of you don't. Most of what you do is through a web browser, which is what a lot of people are already accustomed to rather they believe it or not.The biggest issue i've seen people mention has been the inability to use Microsoft Office with the Chromebook. I've been using Google Drive (formally Google Docs) since I was back in a college and it has been an ample substitute to the familiar software I have grown up with. If you still prefer to use Microsoft Office, you can still go to the Office.com website on your Chromebook and compose documents online in a lightweight, free version of the software.Video playback on the Chromebook has improved, but what is holding it back, unfortunately, is the ARM processor inside of it Most of the time video playback is pretty good, but if you have multiple windows or tabs open, you can see noticeable frames being dropped during the video. This isn't a huge problem, but if you are going to be watching Netflix or Hulu on this machine, you might want to close a few tabs beforehand.Overall I think this was a fantastic purchase, especially for the price. The Chromebook is beneficial to a specific user in mind, but if you feel you might be that user, you can't really go wrong with a Chromebook. My recommendation as of March 2014 would be the Acer c720 since the price is comparable and it has an Intel Haswell processor that gives the Chromebook better performance and better battery life than the this Samsung model.

It still works the same as 6 months ago, but there were issues even then.Pros-Turns on/updates quickly-Programs open fast-Simple UI-Relatively cheap-Free 3G (sort of)Cons-Takes forever to load webpages. I have a desktop PC as well, and even when on the exact same connection my chromebook can take 5-10 seconds longer to load webpages. This causes a huge loss in working speed because it can take minutes for Google Drive to open and for me to actually reach the folder where my documents are contained.-Input is not processed most of the time. I believe this has to do with the fact that webpages are still loading, but even multiple minutes after the page loads my inputs might not register on the page simply because the chromebook's processor is too tied up.-Very low power. I understand that this is a very cheap laptop made to be affordable and fast on the internet, but I mainly play flash games, watch YouTube, go on Google Drive, or browse webpages. I've already stated how loading webpages and horrible response time makes it hard to do any of these, but the horrible processing power makes it worse. Want to watch a YouTube video at 30 frames per second? Nope, here's a video in 360p at 18 frames per second. Want to play a flash game at all? Nope, here's a flash game running at 30 frames per second, then freezes for ten seconds every couple seconds.-The free 3G is definitely not enough. Just navigating to this review page on amazon would likely cause me to go near my cap of 100 MB per month, that is if I'm not paying verizon a hefty sum for a plan I usually don't use. The only times I do use my 3G are the times which I need more than just 100MB. I usually just turn on my Smartphone's hotspot with an app called FoxFi in order to use more WiFi (4 GB plan on there)-The back panel where the charger, UCB ports and HDMI are located is not very sturdy. It began to fall off quickly once I got it, making it hard to insert USB.Summary-This is not a costly system by any means when compared to other laptops, and is fast on most things but the main selling point: internet speed. Slow loading times, input lag and slow processor speed make using this laptop a pain. The free 3G is nice but 100MB for free a month is not nearly enough.

It's streamlining means it's missing some keys; you have to remember and use combinations instead.  This includes the delete key--kind of an important key for me--very irritating!  When it gets hot after a few hours, weird things happen, s.a. when I use the touchpad, the whole page moves instead of just the cursor; the cursor keeps changing shape and function on its own; can't scroll up and down; finally it freezes and google has to reboot.  This is the worst computer I've ever owned!  Speed is its best quality, but that doesn't count for much when I have to turn it off because it keeps freezing.

This is a new interpretation of that. I am reviewing this for someone who has no idea what a Chromebook is or who it is for.A Chromebook in some ways is similar to a tablet with a made in keyboard. Chromebook has a very small operating system that you can't break, doesn't get viruses and essentially updates itself.  What you get in that simplicity is basically no maintenance-- great for those who know very little about computers, tend to always get infected with spyware, those who may not be tech-savvy, etc. and only need to get online for email, internet browsing, youtube playing-- the normal basics.What you get more than a tablet is a full regular keyboard and touchpad. You get a browser and all of the Google Apps family of \"Microsoft Office equivalents\" of documents, spreadsheet, and others. You get access to the Chrome store for other web-apps. You won't get everything here, but the store is expanding rapidly.What you get less than a PC is that you can't install Windows applications and some offline applications that work without an internet connection. The Chromebook is really the true 'netbook. It expects an internet connection at almost all times to be most useful and enjoyable.Let's not joke: this thing is super cheap. And in many ways looks like an 11.6\" Macbook Air. If you're on an absolute budget and can only afford this Chromebook, it is quite sleek and adequate for the money. That being said if you're a premium hardware snob you'll be disappointed-- the touchpad is not nearly as sensitive as a premium (or Apple) touchpad, it has a hollow cheap-ish click and the keyboard is a bit hollow. That being said, if you are new to computers, don't be bothered by those descriptions: You'll only notice those drawbacks if you've already tasted the sweet nectar of a premium high end laptop that's build from metal.This one is built with plastic and it feels like it was intentionally imaged after the Macbook Air 11.6\" or other Ultrabooks. This is a good thing. The unit is slim in most aspects and is quite visually appealing compared to other Chromebooks. The charger brick is tiny. The charging jack is tiny. The battery life is very good but the horsepower under the hood is light-- don't expect to have 20 tabs open in Chrome and get great performance.This is Chromebook reloaded-- and it's clearly moving in the right direction. They have a concept Chrome operating system and that idea of limited but bulletproof will entice some and turn off others. Either you're in or your not. Once you're in, the appearance and design matter, and that's where this evolution is compared to previous Chromebooks.I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 for the hollow touchpad and hollow keyboard feeling. I also had to return my first one because the device kept locking up. That was a random fluke bad unit and I didn't detract for that because a lifetime of tech purchases has told me that even the best have occasional failures.If you're just looking to touch your toes in the Chromebook, this is my recommended option.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "GimpyK", "ReviewID": "R2GSQ7RBMK2IQ4", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband just surprised me with a chromebook for my birthday.

It's very anti-glare, and has a VERY crisp image+ Google Chrome is not as bad as I thought it would be as an OS...+ The keyboard is something I was able to get used to decently fast+ It's very compact, and lightweight+ It's perfect for students, or office work!+ Love the multi-touch mouse pad!+ It has a webcam, but if you use Skype to video chat, read #1 in \"The Bad\"The bad:- It's locked down, meaning you cannot install anything except what Google Chrome has to offer.  Therefore, no things like Skype until Google decides they want to add it, if ever.- The power button is right above the backspace, and right were delete usually is, so dont miss! ;)- The mouse pad, and clicker are one thing, therefore, if you are using 1 finger to navigate, and the other to click, you may end up moving the mouse in two different directionsThe ugly:Nothing yet... it's pretty sleek lookin!Verdict (TL/DR) - It's a great laptop.  The size and weight make it insanely portable, but also make it feel like it is not very tough, so you are likely to have to take good care of it in your travels.  The Google OS doesnt fail as hard as I was assuming it would have, but it does severely limit the point of having a laptop.  For those of you who want a laptop, and plan to use it a lot for Skype, dont get a Chromebook.  However, if you are more of a Google Hangouts person, it should be fine for you.  Otherwise, I would really give this my suggestion for students like myself.  It's something simple to take to class for notes and such, and will get the job done.

This Chromebook has achieved a remarkable market position when one considers the combination of its competitive price-point, seamless cloud-based performance and battery life, and appealing hardware design that makes even the $999 low-end MacBook Air look like a massive rip-off.Yes, Samsung's XE303C12 does not (yet- see Gmail Offline) run well-known applications from its local storage, and privacy may be a concern with its cloud-based storage of user data. But this gain in convenience usually comes at some reduction in security, especially in the new paradigm of cloud computing. The convenience gain: data backup and operating system maintenance procedures are now automatic and free-of-charge, and damage or theft to your computer will not result in major data loss. Just change your Google password and buy another reasonably-priced $249 Chromebook and your worries are minimized. Of course, more secure computing alternatives will always have its adherents, but for general users (students, digital immigrant family members, tech-savvy children), this Chromebook will provide a welcome relief to the premium hardware \"tax\" that comes with most of Apple's popular computing products.Microsoft Office fans will be delighted to know that limited web-based versions of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint programs can be used free-of-charge through the Chrome browser using the free (for the first 7GB) SkyDrive storage service.

This Chromebook is fantastic in every way, shape and form. The only thing that I have not been able to do with it is log in to an enterprise Microsoft Sharepoint server, but that is not a huge deal to me. I have been able to do almost anything else I would ever want to do with it. I use it every night to use Google Video Chat with my girlfriend, and the only issues I see with that are typically when the internet is slow. Nothing client-based.Logmein and Chrome Remote Desktop make for fantastic remote desktop solutions, and both work very well on the Chromebook. That is great for me because a 17.6\" gaming laptop is heavy to carry around, so if I must use Windows then I can always remote in to it from anywhere. It also helps to know that (finally) Logmein is working on an extension for Google Chrome, in case that is an important service for you.I have not had any issues with pages loading on the Chromebook. They all seem to work as they are supposed to. Even though it runs on a mobile processor, I do not notice any lag or anything like that even with 1080p video playback. Boot time is consistently under 10 seconds and time to resume from sleep is virtually instantaneous.If you are an avid user of Google services, then the Chromebook will work great for you. I use Google Drive quite frequently and the free 100gb comes in handy for me. It is great to use Google Docs when I am on the run because I can resume my work anywhere from any computer. The only issue I have with that is when typing its equivalent of a Word Document, you cannot merge cells in a table. Oh well.Battery life is great too, with an average of 6 hours on general web browsing, 4.5 for video chat.If there is anything you need to do on a Windows computer, more than likely there is a free web-based solution. For that matter, I even found a web-based alternative to Photoshop!Unlike many operating systems, updates are not something you have to think about anymore. They handle themselves, and all you have to do is restart your Chromebook occasionally (which when updating still takes under a minute).Overall I have to say, this is probably one of the best computers to be invented.

For me, this would have been a deal breaker had I known as I rather enjoy netlix.  Also, Skype has no Chromebook app, so you must rely on an app such as Imo, which doesn't work nearly as good (long lag times when messaging, logging you in and out at odd times).

The battery life is a solid 6 hours and the size is perfect for an airline seat. Even more delightful is the Chrome OS. It boots up in seconds and connects you directly to your Google account in the Chrome Web Browser. Email is easy and documents come up for your work directly in the Web Browser. The screen is bright and the keyboard is superb, even for long typing sessions, far superior to any tablet or smart phone keyboard. At 2.4 lbs it is a delight to carry and tote. The Case Logic Netbook Sleeve is highly recommended as a well padded case. Otherwise, the Chromebook fits nicely in your average briefcase.  The technical details are even more impressive. The Exynos 5 system on a chip dual core ARM processor is low power and fast, 32 nm technology similar to a chip that would be used in a smart phone. This provides long battery life. The Chrome OS is easy to use, based on a Linux kernel, again similar to an Android Smart phone. So basically the Chromebook is a smart phone transformed into a laptop with a great screen and keyboard. The virtue of this is that the Chrome OS is constantly monitored for cyber attacks by Google and routinely updated when you log in, without requiring separate anti-virus software. It is such a relief to be free from Windows updates and free from the constant need to purchase and update anti-virus software.

I'm very happy with the purchase and Amazon was amazing as usual with the fast delivery and smooth transaction.UPDATE: March 5,2013. I still love this Chromebook but I did end up getting a clearance Acer Aspire One D270-1824 for the functions that only a hard drive can perform. I keep it at home and now I have the best of both worlds for just over $400.00. While I'm downloading songs on my Acer I use the Chromebook to surf the web and email in blazing speed without the hang-ups of a hard drive. I use McAfee to keep viruses at bay on my Acer but that's not an issue with my Chromebook. I should mention that the Chromebook updates in literally seconds after you shut the unit down. Because of the hard drive my Acer takes what seems forever to update Windows, McAfee, Adobe, etc. But, I can use Skype on my Acer, not Chromebook. The trade-offs aren't an issue since I bought both devices. It really makes the point that there isn't a single perfect device for everyone because of all the competing programs and platforms.To sum it all up for anyone considering the Google Chromebook the main point of getting a Chromebook for me was simply surfing the web and receiving/sending email. Think of it as a portable web browser without any storage and you'll come to appreciate it for what it truly is, limitations and all. I bring it to work and browse my bookmarked websites and send/read email during lunch. Flip open the top, connect to free wifi and you're online in seconds.

For work, I need a windows laptop for now for the reason most people do:  working with images, using Microsoft office, transferring and managing files, working on the VPN and collaborating with my customers and coworkers.But when my work laptop is off, there are basically 5 things I always do:  1) read books, 2) occasionally let the kids play games, 3) consume media, 4) surf the web and 5) email/communicate with others.Despite the assortment of devices I have, the ones I use the most are the Kindle and my iPhone.  The iPad is neat, but usually I find myself starting a task which is just easier with a keyboard.  It's become a toy for the kids and for my wife to use for Pinterest/Facebook.I really hated the idea of turning my work laptop back on at night, and I really felt like the iPad didn't enable me to do enough with it that I started looking at buying a second laptop.I couldn't find a laptop that was of decent quality, weighing less than 4 lbs with a SSD running an ARM CPU that offers at least 4 hours of battery life.  This meant either buying a very heavy and very cheap laptop which was prone to failure for $350-$450, or spending between $800-$1000 for a MBA or Windows 8 ultrabook.I took a gamble and purchased the Chromebook, and based on many of the mixed reviews, didn't know if I would be happy with the purchase or not.Let me get the negatives out of the way first, because there are a few:1.  As others have pointed, the body is not unibody aluminum.  It creaks and is plastic, so you'll get some moaning and groaning if you hold it a certain way, and it will probably have its paint peel over time.2.  The keyboard sounds like it needs to be oiled.  Never used a squeaky keyboard before, but whatever.3.  The ports are all in the back.  Can be annoying if you need to use them, especially USB.4.  If you are not looking at the display head on, it will wash out and be unviewable.  45 degrees or more from dead on center and good luck seeing what is on screen.5.  I would often zone out and forget I'm not using a laptop.  Since I don't use Google Docs, I would have to lug out my PC to edit a document.6.  This is minor, and may be user error as I learn to use the Chromebook, but since it doesn't run apps per-se, there aren't any alerts or notifications you can set up.  Example - on my work laptop I installed Google Talk, so I always get a pop-up notification in the system tray when new email arrives.  Not so on Chromebook.7.  The webcam is not good at all.If those are dealbreakers for you, you probably shouldn't be buying a Chromebook.Now for what it does well:1.  Price.  It's $249.  You get 2 years of 100 GB Google Drive storage, and 10 go-go in flight internet passes.  If you are someone like me who (up until now) pays Google for storage space (or someone else like Dropbox, box.net, etc), that's $120 you will save over 2 years versus getting a monthly plan.  The internet is also worth to me $10 a pass.  If you're a Google user and fly a decent amount, this is almost a no-cost purchase.2.  Even if you're not, I dare someone to find an ARM based netbook weighing less than 3 lbs that gets more than 5 hours of battery life with a great keyboard for less than $400.3.  Chrome runs fine for just about anything that is not CPU intensive, but again, if you need that level of horsepower, you either already have a Macbook Air/Pro or a heavy duty Wintel laptop.  For surfing the web, watching amazon prime, communicating with friends, viewing images, reading news and consuming information, writing your blog, streaming music, this is plenty sufficient.4.  The keyboard is phenomenal.  It does sound squeaky, but it's extremely comfortable to type on.5.  The trackpad (and maybe I have low expectations) works great as well.  No jumping around, getting lost on the screen, great responsiveness.  Beats anything I've used on windows laptops.6.  It's an attractive piece of hardware.  Derivative?  Yep.  But who cares.  It looks good.  People keep asking me what it is when I'm at Starbucks with it powered up.7.  It closes the gap for me between my smartphone and my work PC.  Would it be nice if it had a touchscreen and ran Android apps?  Sure.  But at $249, I can now justify buying the next Chromebook, as I assume at some point they will have touchscreens and run apps.  I usually have my phone nearby, so if I need to play games, run apps, or call someone I have it.8.  This is a negative of all tablets, but they're extremely difficult to use if they aren't sitting on your lap.  Reading books on a tablet is not fun right now, the tablet is too heavy.  The Chromebook is perfect for most environments - it rests on your lap or can sit on a table.Bottom line, this is a great device for what it is.  If you find yourself wishing your tablet had a keyboard, or if you find yourself using your tablet for nothing but games and email, then you probably will find this to be great.  If you worry about having access to Microsoft Office, or needing something which will let you print, or you find yourself often in places with no internet, you probably should consider other options.When I'm sitting around watching TV, or in a coffee establishment/restaurant, at the airport, or parked at work, I reach for my Chromebook most of the time.  If not, then I probably either need my work laptop or my phone.And since they're so cheap, I don't worry about buying the next one whenever it comes out.", "Date": "January 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it - lightweight, great value for price", "Author": "LilyWoolf \"truemaine\"", "ReviewID": "R1Q1E2R2GF0B3V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Exactly what I was looking for - a cheap computer for the road and livingroom that's lightweight and fast.

Expecting it to do anything else and your expecting to much. Yes it may play SOME video file types and audio but it is hardly built for that and a normal machine with VLC or some other video player will do the job vastly better. Your limited to using online services to do anything, but have offline Google Docs/Scratchpad and a couple other things. There is the 2 years worth of 100gb online storage, which is good for backing up files online so you can quickly access them on the go since your 16gb HD will get filled quickly if you try to use it. I personally just use the 100gb free storage for backing up files off site.If your buying this with the expectation of using the 100gb of online storage as if it was a hard drive, don't. It's best used as a backup of your data and to quickly upload your newly made files in Google Docs and such so you can access it anywhere with an Internet connection. As trying to rely on an Internet connection to get the data isn't a good way to go about it, and sometimes it has taken a few minutes for things to show up in the Google Drive folder on the laptop itself. Which trust me put me into a bit of a panic after I wrote a 4 page essay and it wasn't appearing when I needed to submit it in a few hours. After 10min or so it finally appeared. This is one of the small bugs or shortcomings I found with the OS, there were 1-2 other bugs I found after I thoroughly put it through it paces in the last few weeks. May sound like a lot, but honestly I find more on my primary Win 7 desktop machine in the same time frame, the difference is that I have other options in terms of programs on the Windows machine so I can ignore it. Where as with this I have to work with it.What everyone says is true the boot time is incredibly fast. Never felt the need to time it myself. It will get your online so you can check emails/facebook/etc. With me I personally bought it for school, which means I will end up using Google docs for notes and writing assignment (than putting it into a real word processor before submitting, so I can use spelling/grammar check). As well and researching assignments all of which this thing will do quite well.What this laptop is though is the exact definition of K.I.S.S (Keep It Short and Simple). It is a stripped down OS with cheap quality hardware which was selected to give the best user experience, not benchmark experience. The arm A15 1.7ghz dual core is more than capable of handling all tasks this was designed for (Internet) and the SSD provides a quick boot experience, quality keyboard/touchpad and overall build quality. The only grip here is with the screen with bad viewing angels, and how the light sensor keeps adjusting the screen too much based on the light condition.The OS itself is one of the things I like the most. It is highly sandboxed with how the OS was designed, with updates pushed silently in the background. And all the user data is encrypted with 128bit encryption, and quite a bit of other encryption found in various other places in the OS using the TPM. Something I won't go into as it's a good read if you look into it, and some of it goes over my head so I'd rather not spread false information. For me the encryption part is quite important as it is a laptop and will be used on the go and having it lost/stolen will just mean I lose the device itself and not half to worry about personal information being compromised. Assuming it is powered down, or signed off not just a locked screen (and you used a good strong password). The OS also has a \"Self Healing\" which I hear some people refer to it as, when the computer turns on it checks against a known good version of itself to check for tampering and if there is any tampering it will use that instead of the tampered version.The biggest strength this laptop has is also it's weakness. It is built with simplicity in mind. It carries the mentality of \"If it works it works, if it doesn't it doesn't\" there are pretty much no workarounds to that (K.I.S.S as I referred to it earlier). Where as with a Window or \"real\" Linux based machine there is almost always a workaround you can do to get the job done. Where as with this if something doesn't work your out of luck, your not given the ability to install any actual programs or any real control in the computer settings. The amount of control in the computer settings is what you find in the Chrome Browser and a few other small settings which I wouldn't mind someone computer illiterate play with (AKA no real ability to change anything). But you do have the option to change the \"search key\" back to \"caps lock\" if you choose to do so. Though personally I found more use for the search key as it brings up the minimized taskbar and will search the Internet and various other things for you.In short this laptop is made to be used on the Internet, nothing more nothing less. If you want a laptop to do basic web browsing on the cheap this is for you. If you want something to write up paper and do web browsing, you can do that to. But I highly recommend loading up what you write into a real word processor so you can take advantage of spelling/grammar check and all the other features Google Docs doesn't provide or provide a good enough version of as I find it quite basic. In terms of buying this for school, I find it would be quite good for that so far from playing with it for the last several weeks though I haven't had a chance to try it out in class myself yet. As I already put several notes into Google docs so far, and have had great battery life with this. You can easily make it through any class without charging.And to answer your question you may be asking yourself. Yes it's a great little laptop and worth buying IF you can manage to work within it's limitations. If you want to know if you can, install chrome on your computer and try to use nothing but that and Google docs, Google drive, and other Google web based programs for a day or two. The rest of the OS is quite simple to learn, it took me less than 10min to figure out almost everything I could do with it due to having experience with Chrome Browser. It also has chrome remote access so you can remote access your Windows based machine to do quick amount of real work while on the go, but it isn't something I rely on if you can.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "No JAVA support !!!", "Author": "Lynn Robertson", "ReviewID": "R2379VVS17RB8Y", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Chromebook has one fault so far.

My Chromebook lived up to my expectations.I personally love the keyboard, I can't believe how fast I've adapted to it, because it did look a little small when I first laid eyes on it. The screen is matte, which personally I like (no chance of glare), though I had read previously that the viewing angles were nothing to brag about, I was pleasantly surprised, the screen is more than adequate. The oversize touch pad is a breeze to use, though getting used to the two finger right click is taking me a little time.Overall it's a wonderful computer for people who need a computer for browsing the web and typing up documents.

So much of what I need to do online (email, blog, message boards, and read) are not things I necessarily need to store on my own computer, but are places I just need access.  I know techies call it \"the cloud\".....I just call it....\"out there somewhere\".  I knew I didn't necessarily need a huge processor or large amounts of storage \"space\", and I also love to take the laptop to a local coffee shop to people watch and write....so a good battery and something that doesn't make my shoulder ache were my goals.For the most part I'm happy with the Chromebook.  I was online and going within 5 minutes of opening the box.  The size is perfect for slipping into a large purse or small bag.  The battery lives up to it's 6 hour promise.  The keyboard doesn't feel as small as I feared it would, and is fairly comfortable to use.Now for the things that I didn't expect:There is no cap lock.  Hmmmm.....after 40+ years of typing I'm finding it hard to remember that fact AND it does make the transition from typing all day at work to computing at home a bit confusing.The \"two finger\" touchpad just doesn't work for me, I'm scoured the forums looking for some mystical magical trick that I'm missing to no avail.  There is no right click/ left click function, so things that used to be so simple like clicking on a word to use the spell check function or right clicking to open things in a new tab don't work.  I didn't realize just how much I used the right click function on the touchpad of my laptop.There is no delete key in upper right corner however, the power key is up there so I have MORE THAN ONCE turned the thing off in the middle of what I am doing.  I miss my delete key.  I miss highlighting unwanted text and quickly using the right click to edit, so I am finding that some of the usual chores I do online are taking me longer or I'm procrastinating them until I am home on the desktop.The last negative for me is that the keyboard is very sensitive.  If I stop typing (to ponder the meaning of life and everything) and allow my hand to relax then the cursor jumps all over the place and I end up erasing what I've written.So to wrap it up, for my use, the Chromebook is not comfortable for extending writing or blogging, but is great for checking email, surfing, reading and most other general things that I use a laptop for while on the go.  Great for travel, but when I am really feeling inspired and want to sit down and hash out some creative writing, the omission of often used keys, and placement of others leaves me feeling frustrated instead of motivated.10/08/2013 Update:I would not buy this product again.  If it were only for traveling and on the go it would be fine but it's just too hard to use for regular blogging and correspondence.  Often times while typing the cursor will skip around and begin typing in another place of the document, no matter how careful I am if my left wrist so much as grazes the edge of the Chromebook it will cause things to disappear, hop around and just be crazy.  With no \"harddrive\" everything is backed up immediately (so they say) but on 3 occasions I have written something at say -- a coffee shop-- saved and returned home only to find it completely gone, not a trace anywhere.  I barely have time to do things once, let alone twice.The lack of a delete key means if you want to correct something you've just typed you must maneuver your cursor, get behind it and backspace over it....way too time consuming when the Muse has struck.  Also .... can't skype on it.  Tried calling Skype for help -- nope--- they claim it's not supported, so my dream of skyping with the Granddaughter died.  Many programs I use daily I can't use on my Chromebook....like Swagbucks.  Hey....I love saving money with my Swagbucks but the toolbar won't load and Encrave just will not run.So...if you need an extra device for things on the go, it's still easier than using the Kindle .... I don't like email on my Kindle.....but if you need to actually get down and dirty and do some work....this machine might not be any better for you than it has been for me. !12/2013I have to replace this with something easier to use.

If you use the shell for ssh connections, there is no X-forwarding, which is irritating.  Chrome's Remote Desktop is wonderful, but you have to install it on each computer it is used on.  Worth the effort.  RDP emulators don't seem to be supported on this Samsung version.  This is mainly a poke at Samsung, not Google.  Since I use Google Apps, this device is impressive and effective.  Would purchase again, but 2 of 3 full/partial failures remind me of several defunct PC manufacturers.Original review:Warts and all, I am much happier carrying 2.5 lbs rather than 10.  I use it with a very inexpensive 23\" LED screen attached.  All things considered, my office computer is a Windows 8 Ferrari but life is significantly easier working on a Fiat 500 90% of the time.I've heard lots of complaints that a Chromebook  is a browser with a keyboard attached.  It is, but that begs the question of cloud computing.  If you need to use it on while traveling, a wireless internet connection is mandatory - you can only do so much working on documents stored on a USB stick.If you want a cheap Windows or Mac clone, do not buy this product,  Chrome-OS is dependent on keyboard shortcuts which are unique to Chrome and they take a bit of getting used to.  Ctrl-Alt-? launches an overwhelming array of shortcuts, my advice is to ignore them.  Learn no more than what you need.App are plentiful, but for work,you get a limited but functional office suite, fast email, Google drive and broad compatibility with Microsoft cloud services.  Chrome Remote Desktop is awesome.

I still can't believe this laptop is only $250. I have been an Apple user since 1989 and this is the first non-Apple computer I've ever purchased. I got this as a second (or third) computer as I have an iMac as my main system and an ailing MBP circa 2007 that is still chugging along. I was looking at replacing the MBP with a Macbook Air, but was balking at the pricetag. I really didn't need it to do any heavy lifting in terms of video, photo or web work, but mainly to catch up on email, keep up with scheduling, do some research and use office documents. I've since found a lot more uses for it...For me the killer app on this system is the Remote Desktop app which means that you can access your main system remotely and use any app on that system, save to Google Drive or Drop Box and you're good to go while away from your office. It is small, light and very quick. I've had zero issues in the three weeks I've had it. I'm happy to be free of Apple's spinning beachball (curiously never happens when I'm buying something from their store...), the weight of my old MBP and am super happy that this cost me a sixth of the cost of a Macbook Air!!!Cloud computing is easy to get used to. Google makes it ridiculously easy. They will need to beef up their app store to make this viable in the long term and I believe they will do it.A quick note for Canadian customers. You're going to have to purchase this in the US and bring it back with you. A lot of Google's products like Google Play for music and movies don't work in Canada which really sucks. You only need the wifi version as the 3G is pointless here. There are plenty of great apps to do what you normally do in those bloated, overly expensive Mac apps (can't speak for Windows), it's just a question of finding the appropriate equivalent. To be honest, my MBP is sitting on my desk with the lid shut collecting dust. I don't have to think twice to take the Chromebook with me as it is so small and light.

I'm sure that thousands of you don't have this problem, but I've just became one of those one star people whom I always look at and wonder \"Why one star if everyone else loves it\", for things like this.=============================This arrived yesterday, came well packaged and secure (though only paper was used by amazon to secure the chromebook box within the main package).  After unboxing and turning on (for some reason it would only turn on the first time when it was connected to the mains power supply despite it then being at 98%, it's been on and off since then, I think it could have been a user problem?) the setup couldn't be simpler, just log in using your google account...and that's it.The build quality for the price is excelled, nothing felt 'hollow' or unsupported, the keyboard is very satisfying to use, as is the trackpad and multi touch.  I thought that the screen wouldn't be very bright having read some of the other reviews but at max brightness it was definitely bright enough for me!  I happened to find 1/2 to 2/3 brightness better to work at.  The keys looks nice and the dedicated browsing buttons are great and take the place of F1-F12 etc.(as you no longer need F keys).  my only turn off is that after typing for a few hours there was already a patina of grease on the space bar  from my thumb (I was my hands, honestly!) that I'm going to keep on top of with chlorox wipes (I guess it's good for hygiene) but that surprised me as it took a 'long' time for my last laptop to show this shine on its keys (mostly because I was wearing the plastic away from use).All the 'apps' work as you would expect and look basically like their online counterparts (most of the apps are just links to the online versions) though you can use documents offline and they will be uploaded next time you connect to the internet, you can also choose to sync your google documents and download your files for use offline (not sure how this will work if I go over the storage limit of the chromebook...or where they're kept when they can be used offline as they're not in the \"files\" folder.Connectability seems good, USB ports, AV out, SD card slots etc. all present, the power supply seems a weak spot in the back if you knock it off a table or drop it, looks like it's waiting to snap off due to it being very thin.  I heard that the bottom scratches easily so assumed that it had no support pads but it does...so I can only assume people are resting it on their laps on ... zips or something, it seems fine to me.Battery length...is awesome.  I sat and types for 3 hours + online last night on 2/3 brightness and the adaptive battery monitor but me at around 55-60% with 4 hours left at that useage level so it definitely does what I need it to in that aspect.As we all know, Netflix is not working at the moment on this due to the ARM processor but it looks like it's in the works, hulu works as does pandora etc. and crunchyroll for those who like anime so that's nice.You can easily customize the background etc. and the in built camera/mic is nice for vid chatting though you're currently limited to google vid etc.  having the guest option is a nice touch, I can just hold the power button once, log off and someone else is on instantly to browse around (basically puts it into incognito mode so nothing is saved).  Startup time is around 9-10 seconds to the desktop depending on how fast you can type your password but it's about 7-8 seconds to the main login screen as promised.Google drive is easily upgraded and adds onto whatever google drive is associated with the first account you log in with.  I'm still not sure how to get my internet passes but I'll worry about that when I actually a) need them b) go on an airline where I can use them.  I don't think I could ever use my 5gb so 105gb is a massive amount.  I haven't tried streaming video from google drive (not sure if that's even possible) but if it is that could be a nice compromise from movies on a flash drive/SD card.Google remote looks promising if you don't mind keeping your main pc on at home as you could theoretically load programs on that and remote control it to display on the chromebook (correct me if I'm wrong).Once I've used it more regularly I'll update this with any problems I've found but so far Samsung appear to have hit it out of the park and I have zero actual complaints (no start errors requiring reloads that other users seem to have). Would definitely recommend.------------------------------------------Edit: 4/9/2013I use my chromebook for my extended campus program (about 5 hours at a time) and I've never yet ran out of battery or came close, with lower brightness settings, not using speakers etc.  just wireless and typing I can get 8 hours.  Average life is dot on 6 hours as promised.  As a build issue I have noticed that the trackpad on the bottom right is a little lower than the left, easier to click, I don't know if this was intended but it hasn't gotten worse and it's not that noticeable but I thought I'd mention it.The auto update works flawlessly (I had a minor issue when I changed my google password but once it connected to the wifi it asked me to update it), you get to use sites like hulu and crackle along with Netflix (I hear, I haven't tried yet myself but apparently this has been a recent change!)If you're looking for a replacement for your desktop pc (or even your traditional OS laptop) this isn't for you, if you're looking to supplement it, go right ahead, you won't regret it.Also I've never seen any of the problems that the 1 stars have mentioned, black screens, dead, having to push reset, not finding wireless etc.  I think it could have been a bad  early batch.", "Date": "January 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "AWESOME AND STYLISH", "Author": "Nga", "ReviewID": "R1GOJW4T12IUVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This laptop is lightweight, heat-less, noiseless and battery lasts for ever...what else do you want from a portable computer.

I've appreciated the simplicity, the fast javascript performance and synchronization features. When Chrome OS was announced I scoffed at Google's \"vision\" for mobile computing, but over time I warmed up to it. This is my very first Chromebook, sadly I was never able to get a free CR48 when Chrome OS was in beta. I was interest in the new ARM Enyox processing architecture which allowed a cool quiet way to access the web.Cons:Chromebook arrived, booted it up. Took awhile to update but once that was done the first thing I noticed was choppiness and lag. It just wasn't smooth. Screen was washed out and a bit grainy but honestly I wasn't expecting anything more for the price. But the speed and snappiness that is synonymous with Chrome just wasn't there. Flash stutters on some websites, heavy html5 websites stutter, angry birds stutters (hey doesn't that game run great on like a 2nd gen iPod touch?). I actually suspect this might just be an optimization issue as the arm architecture underneath powers some pretty advanced devices today without a hitch. But I honestly couldn't recommend this Chromebook for dedicated flash gamers or heavy video watchers or someone who likes a lot of tabs open. I understand Chrome is a compromise in features but they should try harder not to compromise the performance either, even at $250 I'm still holding Google accountable for not fully delivering an authentic Chrome experience. I did install Adblock Plus and Flashblock to cut down on webpage bloat and it seems to have helped.Pros:With simplicity comes serious security. This is probably the premiere banking terminal you could buy. Linux underpinnings, sand boxing and integrity monitoring, zero viruses. Though I will say this wont protect you from phishing scams so always been on the lookout for those.The keyboard and touchpad integration with the OS is very good. Touch gestures, dedicated keys for back, forward, refresh. Chromebook has an Apple-like hardware/software integration that allows for a pure experience that what you see is what Google intended for you to see, unlike Windows PCs and the bloatware that accompanies them. This perfect union of Google and Samsung is still made painful by the fact the Chromebook could use a little power boost underneath the hood.100gb of Google Drive with native support on ChromeOS built right into the file manager itself. This renders most complaints about a 16gb flash drive moot. You just got $100+ in high end cloud storage for free! That alone sets this device into a \"buy it\" category despite performance hiccups.If someone steals it, you'll only cry for around ten minutes versus the entire day if it were a Macbook AIR. This is a cheap piece of tech. Though if you're like me $250 is still a lot of money you're still gonna be pretty upset if it's taken. But hey, what would you rather take to a cafe and peruse the net while drinking some coffee? A Macbook or a Chromebook? And that's the beauty of this machine. It's a great portable buddy with low risk.Summary:This device is like if someone thought \"Hey the Macbook Air in concept does a lot of things right, except the part where most people use 5% of the features and pay 7x more than they should\". It's got the thin, sleek design and the Chrome logo is a little bit of a fashion statement in its own right. However Google in it's quest to mainstream their excellent piece of software took a little bit of the nitro out of that powerful engine in order to keep prices low. What happens is that you're getting a browser that more often than not sputters at any website with complexity. Part of me thinks the hardware in this device is more than adequate and Chrome OS 24, 25 will be further optimized to bring back some of that bang.If you're looking for the pinnacle of Chrome or Google's fast HTML5 vision for the future you're not going to find it here, but if you're looking that sweet piece of \"good enough\" computing without the bloated price tag and maintenance of the big boys, you've found your nirvana.", "Date": "December 4, 2012"}, {"Title": "IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER,A CHROMEBOOK FOR EVERYONE?...WELL MAYBE", "Author": "Zabeatta \"Zabeatta\"", "ReviewID": "R32L5DR26QL5C9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love using the Chrome OS and the Chrome browser on all of my devices(i phone,windows PC and android tables and more)it's the best.I used the Chromebox for about 3 months to see if I wanted to take the next step,The Chromebook.

I bought it strictly for bed side web use, and it excels at this task. I prefer to use this in bed over my tablet because the keyboard base holds the display nicely for me while I am being lazy and laying on my side. The computer boots up extremely quickly. I never bother using the sleep functionality...when I'm not using I just shut it down since it boots in the matter of seconds anyways. Also, I was pleasantly surprised with the keyboard. There is a fair amount of travel in the keys which makes typing a breeze. In my normal use, I only notice VERY slight checkerboarding when I attempt to two finger scroll extremely quickly. Under normal use, I never see it. Speaking of scrolling, I love that Samsung has integrated two finger scroll gestures into the very large touch pad. This is one of the best touchpad and keyboard combos I have used on any laptop, regardless of price. Granted, it is not as good as a thinkpad, but the feel is at least equal to that of my old macbook air (2012). The ARM processor in this thing is more than adequate for running a web browser. In my experience, I have been getting 7 hours or so of battery life during normal usage. Of special note is that this puppy is completely silent (fanless) and stays remarkably cool. One thing I do miss wholeheartedly is the backlit keys. The only other complaint is screen quality/brightness, but for the money, it is acceptable. This is not an IPS display, but what it does offer is a matte screen with even backlighting (albeit dimmer than most)...and I think that is all you should expect at this price point.

I bubble wrapped it to where it should have been fine being dropped off a roof.  Well UPS evidently became responsible.  I am just upset that the repair company stated the screen was cracked when it wasn't & I am pretty sure UPS didn't break it either. Damaged boxes in a repair shop are usually not accepted in receiving.  Supposedly a refurbished unit is being sent out.

It seems to be really high quality, and it's just an amazing laptop in general. I'm a high school student so I really wanted a laptop that wasn't too big, worked fast, was light and thin, and was easy to write on and browse the internet--I got all of those things in this! I would highly recommend this for anyone, even older people. It's so simple to use, and the software is really good. People that prefer larger screens might not care for it, but I think it's the perfect size, and the good graphics and software make up for it I think. This laptop reminds me a lot of a Macbook. True to their word, the computer turns on in less than 8 seconds, and when it's in sleep mode and you open the lid it turns on in probably 2 seconds. The keyboard and mouse pad is really nice too. It might take a while to get used to some of the shortcuts you have to use on here, like the copy and paste, but I've already gotten the hang of it and it's really easy. The keyboard is really easy to type on, and I really like the feel of it. If you like keys that are more thick and press down more than you might not like this, but I think it's really good. I honestly have no complaints, and I wouldn't change anything. I have noticed that the screen and lid of the computer gets a little smudgy, but that was really no big deal for me and you can easily wipe it off with your sleeve or a cloth. Also I know that a lot of people use their computers to watch Netflix and or stream it onto their TV, and it works perfectly! I think the graphics are really good, and the sound really isn't bad at all. Since I've only had this for less than a day I'll write an update later on to say how I'm liking it and how it's holding up, but if you're looking for a fast and thin computer that won't get viruses, I think this would be the perfect laptop for you. They even give you a free 100GB storage for Google Drive that you can store photos, videos, and writing documents in, and I've found that really helpful.Here's a list of pros and cons I've come up with and then that's it! Hope this was helpful.PROS:-Very fast and reliable-Thin and light weight so you can easily carry it places-Pretty decent webcam so you can video chat with people-Updates software automatically so you always have the latest stuff-Easy for browsing the web and writing-Not very expensive!CONS:-No disk drive-No iTunes, only Google Music-You can't download games or software like Minecraft", "Date": "March 19, 2014"}, {"Title": "Present for mom", "Author": "Cory J Burns", "ReviewID": "RPK04RRPN1QKC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mother is not computer savvy.

I am a nursing student and needed something lightweight, affordable and able to write papers on and most importantly, open up all of my documents that the teachers make available online. I did a lot of research when it came to buying this and thanks to the reviews I was able to make an excellent decision. Here are a few of the key things that I needed this to do in order to make a smart purchase from a student's perspective:1) Affordable! After looking at all other laptops, this was seemed to give me the most bang for my buck.2) Lightweight - This is only 2.4lbs which is essential when you are walking to and from classes.3) Ability to write papers - although this is unable to have Microsoft Word installed on it, I have available Google Docs which is just as good, in my opinion, as Microsoft Word. A spreadsheet app is also installed and accessible on this as well.4) Opening up required information - I was nervous at first, knowing that I couldn't install Microsoft Word, if I would be able to open up documents that were in that format. After reading a previous review, I saw that I could still open them up and after trying it out for myself... is TRUE! I am able to open up Word Docs as well as Powerpoints.5) Keyboard - I am typing this review with this right now and I have to say, the keyboard is great. Everything is spaced adequately and offers a great typing experience. I type very fast and it hasn't slowed me down.6) Battery life - I have read that the battery on this can last up to 8 hours which is great!As for some cons - Although I do not watch movies online, I did check it out using my Amazon Prime account and did see that the picture quality is not all that great. But considering what I am primarily using this for, it does not impact how I rate the Samsung Chromebook.I have yet to test out to see if my printer will work with this. I have a regular printer that plugs into the computer and also a wifi one. Will see what happens!All in all, this was an amazing purchase and I am so happy that I bought it. I could not be any happier. For students who are looking for something affordable, lightweight and able to do school work on, this is a great buy. I am in LOVE WITH THIS! I hope this review helps anyone who is comparing their options.**UPDATE**So I tried to get my printer to work and unfortunately it would not. And what sucks as well, I do not have another computer that I can manage my printers from. This is a very big disappointment. Apparently you have to sign into your Google account from another computer that is already registered to the printer you are going to use and then manage/add printers from there. From what I read, I don't see any other way around this. Really kind of disappointed with the printing situation :(.

The piece of code that allows you to do this is called \"Crouton\", and is freely available from a GitHub repository with a very simple set of installation instructions included. It is developed mainly by a guy from Google, and it's been getting quite a bit of traction lately.After installing a version of Ubuntu using Crouton, along with the XFCE desktop, I was very surprised at the overall responsiveness of the system, as well as at how easy it is to switch from Ubuntu to Crome OS with a simple keyboard shortcut.Granted, there are some things that still need some more work (e.g. playing videos and flash support out of the box), but given how easy it is to switch from one OS to the other (videos and flash are totally supported in Chrome OS), it's not really a deal breaker for me. I was not really expecting this from such a cheap laptop.In terms of the hardware, I found the keyboard comparable in quality to the ones in recent models of the MacBook Air. The laptop itself, as you can see in the pictures, is pretty slim and lightweight, something I appreciate since I hate carrying around heavy laptops. The touchpad quality is good, but I do miss the support for a full range of gestures found in Apple's computers. One thing I do wish this laptop had is a larger SSD. 16 GB of storage means you will need to keep a lot of your data in an external drive (it's true Google does give you 100GB of free cloud storage for two years, but unless you have a really fast Internet connection, this is no replacement for a hard drive if you're moving around large files). Again, not a deal breaker for me, but something to keep in mind.Overall, it turned out to be an excellent laptop for me once I installed Crouton (and Ubuntu) on it.", "Date": "December 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "Holiday gift for an electric enginner, a big success!", "Author": "gene D.", "ReviewID": "R1DGLNWDLHBEUL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my electric engineer guy friend, not young by any means, so as not to mistake \"likeing this very much\" with stars in his eyes.

Within 10 minutes she was editing a doc from her google docs account, was also looking at tumbler feeds and messaging back-and-forth with 2 different people through facebook, and was adding extensions and apps to the browser based system. And she never even cracked the plastic bag the \"start-up guide\" came in. She's 14 - enough said.2. Went camping with 2 chromebooks (I have one and my significant other has one too - she has also posted a favorable review of her's here) and they performed flawlessly in temps well below freezing. We were tent camping and it got down to around *20 and these things still picked up a park wifi signal and didn't turn into toasters or anything like that. I know this means something because her iPhone went into freakout mode from the cold at around *35. We have also dropped these a few times, had cats lay all over them, tossed them in backpacks that got bumped around, etc. While I wouldn't recommend ANY of this, I'm just pointing out that these little babies are pretty tough. There is no \"super-delicate\" glass screen that will crack if you breath on it funny, or very cheep keyboard that will spring apart the first time you hit one with any force.Update - This thing even got a few ounces of coffee spilled on it and stopped working for all of 15 minutes. A little time under the hair dryer to get things right, and it is back up and running. I'm thinking this thing is a plastic tank.Update 4/9/2014 - the Chromebook I got my daughter now never leaves her side.

Yate", "ReviewID": "R3E3Y99GEFLVLN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would like to start by saying how cool this device is, I got it for my father for Christmas who had a 1904 laptop and we both love it. My father utilizes the computer mainly to browse the internet, listen to music, watch youTube, chat and email. I believe this was the very perfect gift for him because his old laptop was crashing on him because it was getting old it was really heavy and it wasn't holding a charge. It is very simple to use even for a not so computer savvy person.The chromebook is very light, it is lighter than my Kindle Fire(previous Generation) is compact and just the right size. it is not too big or too small. I believe the 11.6 inch is a pretty decent size for what my dad uses the computer for. We were watching youTube videos while browsing the internet and the computer does its job very effortless. We also own a smart TV and my dad was so trilled that he can stream videos from his laptop into the TV without having to download the video into the computer and putting it in a memory stick. You can also use the HDMI connection into the TV, however the Bluetooth option is a lot better because he can play the video and browse the internet at the same time.Whenever my father wants to write a document he can use Google docs which converts a word document automatically into a Microsoft Document, also you can save the document into  your Google Drive which gives you 115 GB of memory for FREE for two years that\u2019s a huge savings right there including the fact that you don\u2019t have to buy programs to write a simple document. In addition it comes with antivirus so you just turn the computer on and browse it up!!! Note: that this computer does not work like a regular Microsoft computer it only downloads apps.When we first opened it, we just logged on with our current Gmail account and uploaded some of the free apps.

It was a step that I wanted to take because I now do everything in the cloud, and have an Android phone and tablet.So, the limitations are:- Can only print to Google cloud ready printers. Or classic printers that are connected to a PC.YOU CANNOT DIRECTLY CONNECT A USB PRINTER TO A CHROMEBOOK, which renders my older Wi-Fi/Bluetooth printer, that is not cloud compatible, useless with my Chromebook. Fortunately, I can print to my husbands B&W; laser printer, but not my awesome color photo printer.- If you are planning on using this to replace a windows laptop or tower, you may need an external monitor, keyboard and mouse.I have a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse that uses the same USB dongle (Logitech's Unifying hardware that can connect up to 6 peripherals to one USB dongle.). This is great to save one of the two USB ports. I would have a printer in the other port... if it worked, but instead it has my phone charger in it. Have also ordered a 20\" Samsung HDMI monitor. This Chromebook does have an HDMI port.- New keyboard shortcuts to learn, and some standard keys not there.E.g. delete - you have to press Alt+Backspace. This is pretty easy to get used to, but not a problem if you have an external keyboard, where all of the regular keys work just the way they should.The number pad on the external wireless keyboard does not work with the built in calculator app on the Chromebook. The number pad works in general text situations only. That's too bad.- Video camera is not awesome.But it works and is acceptable. However - Google Chromebook DOES NOT SUPPORT SKYPE. That's right, you cannot use Skype on this baby. Instead, you are encouraged to use Google Hangouts. I would love to, but none of my chat friends are on there - ha.Those limitations might be deal breakers for some, but I am still happy with my Samsung Chromebook. If I could print to a classic printer without using another PC, I would have given 5 stars.

Consequently, looking at a computer screens is painful and more so now due to the new and awful back lighting . However, this little guy has been a true gift. I can spend 3 to 4 times longer on it before feeling any pain. Its amazing. On a typical laptop I feel pain the moment I turn it on. ( PS: to all you back light sufferers, try covering your screen with car window tint paper. I like the self adhesive kind.) On the Chromebook I can also darken the screen completely. Something I have only found in Macs. Additionally, I need larger font size when I read and I can adjust the font size even though the computer screen is small.  Another great feature, and don't laugh, that my husband and I have found useful is the Power Wash. I've used it twice this last week.

It doesn't feel like you are typing on a miniature device like a keyboard probably should at this size. The keys are large and very responsive so it feels very natural to type.Performance-wise, the Chromebook isn't the fastest thing in the world.

In-flight wifi in general is too slow for anything besides checking e-mail, facebook and reading articles.

You can't install Office on this, or video/photo/music editing software, or computer programming development environments, etc. Instead of Office, you can use Google Docs for document/spreadsheet/presentation editing.

Its battery is good (but does not last as much as they promise). Due to google cloud storage you do not miss hard disk (though it gets very expensive after a point).My biggest complain is about the invisible button on the touch pad. You can click on the lower half of the touch pad to \"left click\". But in this product the button gets stuck. So it is as good as you are clicking and holding it down for a very very long time. Some times it does not come back unless you click a second time. I have three of these devices and ALL of them have the problem. So they probably have whole batch of faulty devices out there.Another problem with the touch pad is its ability to detect multi-touch. I have noticed that a lot of times it fails to detect multi-touch and you end up \"left clicking\" when you intend to write click. Samsung is trying to copy Apple Macs by providing only left click, but they need to realize that if they need to do a good job of it. A lot of people will prefer to have two separate buttons instead of one so it is ok to stick to old fashioned design.Another very serious flaw is that this device is UNACCEPTABLY (I cannot emphasize it more) slow when browsing pictures from my camera (connected via USB). It may be the software or the hardware, I do not know.

I currently have a 17.1\" laptop that I had been using but the weight and size made traveling and using it annoying. While sitting in a meeting I talked with somebody who was using a Chromebook and thought that this might be my solution. I had tried an ipad and other tablets but the onscreen keyboard and/or using a keyboard accessory was not a perfect solution because writing papers and taking notes required too many steps (plug in keybaord, switching between apps while multi-tasking between research/ writing, and finding a place to store my work that would be accessible by my PC/Laptop later). I have owned the Chromebook for about 3 weeks now and can say that this was the BEST solution for my situation, not perfect but best.Why it worked for me:- Instant on: The Chromebook is ready to run and go right away (like a tablet)- Good keyboard: Its keyboard is sufficient and easy to use (like a PC)- No distractions: I am not distracted by updating or unnecessary tasks because this is almost completely a cloud experience- Compact and light: Easily fits in my bag without. No need to buy a special bag to carry this around with you.- Great battery life: I sit in class on weekends for 6 hours or more, when fully charged my chromebook has lasted.- Easy to use: Chrome OS is simple- Connected: Chrome OS connects really well with my laptop and work PCThings I didn't like:- Its painted, I pull this in and out of my bag because of that the outside of the Chromebook has ugly scratches. I am not a fan of adding cases to my devices to protect their finish.- The screen is good, but I would have like something a bit brighter.Other things to know:- if you dont have wifi available or a hotspot you may be limited with what you can do. Google docs and such are available offline but work best when you are connected.- This is a SECONDARY device. This is not a replacement for your PC or laptop, but rather a way to become more mobile. IF you are considering this for your primary then you should expect to work mostly in cloud storage and know that certain things like gaming, photoshoping, etc can be done but not as easily or well done on a PC.- The price is great!

The price of the Chromebook was certainly right, and I was willing to forego Microsoft computing to try it.  I still haven't gotten fully into Google Docs, but then I haven't had a real need for word processing since I've owned it (about a month now).  I'm loving how lightweight it is as well as the keyboard.  The gestures for the touchpad are a bit different and took a couple days to get used to, but it's no problem now - though I do get frustrated when I'm using a regular tablet PC at work and it doesn't respond to the gestures!  The biggest downfall that I can see so far, is that it has gotten into the habit of pausing a video with no way to resume unless you restart it, and of shutting down while streaming videos.  I'm not sure if this is the device or the interface with Hulu though.  I don't recall this problem with Amazon streaming (which I was mostly doing the first couple weeks), but it has become so problematic with Hulu, in the last couple weeks that I actually switched to tv.com (still shuts down, but doesn't get stuck mid-video).  Also, I haven't been able to get Skype - I thought there was a web-based way to do it, but I can't seem to find it (if anyone knows how, I'm all ears), so we've been using Google Hangout, which is adequate, but the quality doesn't seem to be quite as good as Skype.

My early teen needed something to hold him over because I was tired of him borrowing mom's laptop (which I paid good money for) to play sub-par video games and watching videos. Since I knew this is exactly what he would do with any piece of tech in his hand, I figured I can use one of these to make him feel special at the same time have something a little portable at a decent price and leave mom's laptop alone (win, win and win).It has the macbook look and feel (for a fraction of the price) decent screen resolution and very good battery life.  The cons outweigh the pros by a landslide unfortunately.  These are my personal cons so its up to how the user sees fit, so don't get offended by my review.  Here goes....the thing is slow, the 16gb of soldered, unexpandable memory is a no, it lags tremendously with even short youtube clips where you would have to refresh the page often or reboot even though there is hardly anything loaded on the thing.  It has a hard time reading files form a usb stick even if it is at a recognizable format (videos especially, no matter how many times compressed, re-converted or chromebook friendly the video may be) but the worst part in my book which I really thought was a disappointment...the lack of apps in the chromebook app store by google.  My goodness you would at least think that since these are the same people behind android and the fact that the chromebook is not as powerful as a newer android phone, that google would have a lot of the apps that do not require much processing power to operate.  Such as certain media players that are great with older android phones which are slow. All in all, its not windows, its not OS X, its not android and its not iOS.

Needed a portable machine for the occasional travel and day trips with which I could check email and , if required, access main computer at home via Chrome Remote desktop.Works great in those aspects. The Remote Desktop experience isn't the best given the resolution between the two machines but is most certainly functional. Glad I don't need to carry the main laptop around any more.The unit feels a little small at first but that could be because I've never used anything less than 15 inches. Unibody seems well built and durable. The trackpad takes a little getting used to and isn't as responsive as I would like and a little 'quirky' with the cursor disappearing randomly. Still haven't figured out how to do the 'right click'. The keyboard is extremely comfortable.Boots up quick either from sleep or from a cold boot. Speakers are sufficient for streaming services but would recommend headphones if possible. No issue with Amazon Instant / Xfinity / Hulu.Battery life seems to be a little lower than advertised with a full charge lasting about 4.5 hours but I haven't put that through more formal testing.One of the issues I came across was with network connectivity. Having problems connecting to Android phone hotspot (other devices connect fine). Haven't been able to figure that out yet. Most networks work fine. \\Being one of the Google ecosystem constituents, loved the ease of setup, account retrieval and the consistency of syncing across devices. I can search from my main laptop, pick it up from my phone and complete it from the Chrombook. Drive / calendar and other google services work right out of the box.  A lot more offline apps coming up and that's an added advantage.Overall, a great machine for what i need it for.

I'm very impressed with the design, and it is quicker then I expected. I was also thrilled when I plugged in my old DELL mouse, and it hooked up right away.

The hard drive crashed, it was in need of a new battery and fan (both for the third time) and the screen hinge had broken. I was not interested in either a Windows machine or a Mac. I bought a Samsung Chromebook and I'm very happy I did. I had already moved most of my music and documents to the cloud so the change was easy. In two weeks with the Chromebook I haven't missed the local apps that used to clutter up my machines (word processing, video editing, anti-virus, etc.). I open the screen on this thing and in a few seconds I'm on the web for email, Google apps (calendar, documents), games, Facebook, you name it. I have enough local storage on it to save various things but I haven't found the need to. I get about 6 hours of battery life, it runs cool all day, connects to all WiFi networks without incident. and the keyboard is a pleasure. Around two pounds to carry, it slips into my work bag and I hardly know it's there. The other day it did a system update in about 10 seconds. The fact that it is always up to date and virus free only adds to the advantages. Thanks Google and Samsung!

That isn't a bad wait for one of the top two or three selling computer items on Amazon, and it's worth the wait.  I bought it sight unseen, and I couldn't be any happier with my choice.The Chromebook is essentially a non-touchscreen tablet with a keyboard.  It is what netbooks wanted to be but weren't.  It is roughly two inches wider, an inch deeper, and a quarter inch thicker than my first generation iPad and incredibly light with very similar styling.  The keyboard feels \"right\" - the keys are properly sized and spaced and have a natural movement.  There are a few differences that take some getting used to (no outdated caps lock key, for instance), but those are easily overcome.  I especially like the placement of the volume and brightness controls.  The touchpad is very nice - not large enough to get in the way, not too small, although it does not always register my fingers on the first touch.  The screen is bright enough to be seen even with the sun at my back.  The speakers are surprisingly decent and not too tinny with a touch of bass.The battery life is very impressive - I used the Chromebook for all of my surfing, email, and posting for a day without having to recharge.  Whenever I stopped using the device I just closed the screen and it hibernated; when I raised the screen the machine awoke almost instantaneously.  I also like that I can completely lower the brightness of the screen to black - nice if I'm listening to audio and don't need to see what's on the screen.The Chrome experience takes some getting used to.  Pretty much everything is treated like a webpage in the browser;  while there are plenty of items in the Chrome store, very few, if any, are actual applications that run on the machine itself.  I'm still trying to learn how to make my Drive documents available offline, and Google Docs has some differences when compared to Office, but these are to be expected.  There is a learning curve for some keyboard commands and touchpad gestures.  I find myself minimizing the browser instead of the font size at times, and I'm searching for the home button when I reach the bottom of a webpage, but these are minor differences from my usual experience.  I do miss the keyboard shortcut for switching tabs; perhaps I'm missing something.My only complaint so far is that I wish the screen would fold 180 degrees.  When lounging on the couch with the device in my lap I'm tempted to push the screen too far back.  It isn't a major complaint by any stretch.The Chromebook is a good device, but it is a great device for the money.  It seems like the perfect device to pair with a pico projector for sales presentations or for allowing the kids to watch videos while traveling.", "Date": "January 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "great device if you understand what its for", "Author": "Nathan H.

You need a good Internet connection (maybe 3 Mbs) for reasonable performance with files. There is a pretty good set of office software in Google Apps, but not as full featured as MS Office or LibreOffice/OpenOffice.

We have a \"Transformer\" that using Android and, other than the price for the pad feature, the two are very similar (Android also has a lot more apps obviously).Where Chrome shines is it seems to require fewer resources and be a bit more responsive. From my limited upstanding, the apps are done at a lower level. Chrome is just a windows manager on top of X. This is more of a Googlized Linux distro than Android which has an \"App\" framework that chews up extra resources to process.Chrome is a real winner.

I easily sync using GoogleDrive, Dropbox, SkyDrive and Evernote, so I have just about immediate access to all the files I need anytime as long as I'm connected to a network.  Ability to put into full-screen mode using [shift + screen] buttons to maximize viewing space and that works pretty well.  No moving parts so it should be more durable and battery lasts longer - I think this laptop is better than the cheaper Acer chromebook, which has a spinning hard disk.  Battery life is fantastic, it's lightweight, doesn't get hot, and I can use the small solid state hard drive to download/upload files between my accounts.Cons: Audio is poor, viewing the screen from an angle (from sides or above/below) is not great, and the hinge in the back prevents the screen from tilting back more than 45% (which is only an issue because of the usable viewing screen angle).  Can't print using USB connections, instead have to use network printer (not an issue for me, but might be for some). Can't replace my business laptop because Microsoft Office applications (powerpoint and excel for me) have no good online equivalent - online version of Office is limited and far too slow (although I can view any Office document using SkyDrive, which is nice since Google sheets and slides can't always render the images well).Overall, I think this is a great product that fills a niche use for me - everyday use at home and going out to a cafe to work.  It's definitely a value play and can't deliver on all the features I need for business, but they don't market it as such anyway.

I would consider myself a power user of Microsoft Office but have been able to convert almost entirely to Google Docs (...).  What I lose in terms of advanced features I gain in terms of collaboration, publication and access.  I can access Google Docs on almost any device.

The chromebook is incredibly lightweight (almost seems less heavy than my iPad) so it is perfect for carrying around.  Very rarely do I need to do power computing on the go, mostly I need to access my Google Docs and do other Web 2.0 or even Web 1.0 things.  This makes the Chromebook the perfect device. I can bring it with me to Starbucks or a meeting and have a fully working computer.As a teacher I would recommend the chromebook for the classroom, it is a wonderful device that besides being lightweight and robust allows students to log into any machine with their Google account (especially great if your school is Google Apps).  Thus students do not need to be assigned a device, they can jump on any classroom chromebook and have instant access to their files, apps and projects.  Google Drive is an excellent substitute for dropbox, so students can keep all of their files in Google Drive and then have access to them on any machine.  Although, drop box is functional on the chromebook, the integration with Drive makes it a much easier choice.

I read about the Chromebooks for a long time before deciding to take the plunge, weighing all the pros and cons as pointed out by many reviewers and users.  In fact, I'd highly recommend that anyone contemplating purchasing a Chromebook should do exactly that--make sure you know what you're getting and what you're not getting.It suits my needs absolutely perfectly.  Having everything synched into Google Drive across all my devices that I use for various purposes--my iPhone, my iPad mini, the Chromebook, and my desktop Mac--means that I can write pretty much anywhere, anytime, and no matter which device I'm using (I've been known to tap out a thousand words or more on my phone or iPad mini when I'm stuck waiting somewhere for a long time, for example), it's all in sync and I can pick up on another later.I do all my heavy revising and finish work in Scrivener on the Mac, but until I'm ready for that, I work in Google and find its word processing functions more than adequate for writing fiction and creative non-fiction.  When I'm ready, I can simply download the file to my Mac and import it into Scrivener, which is backed up on Dropbox, meaning that I have all of my writing in at least three different places, so I don't worry about losing it.I love the automatic updates and the lack of need to fuss about virus and malware problems.I know that the Chrome OS is only going to get better and better, so I'm willing to put up with the occasional small glitch, though I haven't experienced any yet.  I'm not fond of trackpads in general, so I bought a Logitech USB mouse, which worked instantly.  The keyboard is the best of any laptop I've ever owned, very comfortable for typing; I'd rate it right up there with Apple's bluetooth keyboard.I think this computer is a fabulous value for its price.

I am able to use the chromebook as an auxiliary browsing machine by using a freeware application called Synergy to control it over the network.  Aside from that, there are a broad array of other linux tools now available to me.Even without the ubuntu bit, the chromebook performs smoothly for web browsing, even with many tabs open.  The trackpad and keyboard perform very well and are comfortable during use (especially keyboard).  If I had to complain about anything, it would be the build quality-- if  you pick it up by a corner you can feel the flex (and sometimes hear it).  All things considered, I highly recommend this to anyone looking for the features it offers.

I hate the dell trackpads more than ever.- There's no such thing as crapware on this thing.Here's a list of CONS!- google docs doesn't keep the cursor in the right position if you ctrl+ (zoom) the window. Pretty bush league!!- If you open a document in gdocs, it opens a google drive window. Then clicking the document opens another gdoc window. Three windows!

A few initial reactions...Very easy to get going out of the box,even easier if you have a google account and are familiar with Google Docs and android apps. I loved the small size and minimal weight, however the plastic case is just that, not very substantial plastic.I sure would not want to drop it or crush it in a suitcase or carry on. I'm not sure it would be good or a child unless there was some kind of and otter box-like case to protect it. Don't think it would hold up to kid abuse for the long haul.I bought a royal blue neoprene sleeve with some side pockets that fits well and will hold the charging cord.I bought the Chromebook mostly for ease when traveling. I do have an ipad3 that I love, but wanted a more windows oriented option as well. My at home laptop is a DELL Inspiron, but it is a desktop replacement 17\" and way too big and heavy to take on a trip.The touchpad is adequately responsive, the desktop is uncluttered...it's easy.Uncomplicated. Functional.I already liked the Chrome Browser and enjoy using gmail .Using it is like working with a friend you know well.The charging plug is as ridiculous as others have reviewed. What in the world was Samsung thinking when they designed a dongle thingy that looks like it plugs in to my electric stapler. One will need to be VERY careful when plugging it in and out of the little plug port in the back.The chromebook came partially charged and got to full capacity very quickly.So far so good when using this little guy. It seems to do what I want it to do, is tiny, has good screen resolution, good keyboard action except my \"f\" key sticks and does not react immediately when pushed. I'm debating if I want to send it back for that, it does slow me down when I type, and have to stop and think about if the \"f\" printed. Very annoying. Hoping it will loosen up and work like the other keys. I do like the keyboard action overall.I read all the reviews about this machine before I ordered it and I'm beginning to think there are some people who just dream up negative reviews to stir things up...One person said, no delete key....uhh, what's wrong with the backspace for that? There is also a keyboard shortcut that takes the place of a cap lock but I will have to go back in and figure out where those keyboard shortcuts are again..So my reaction is mixed, but leaning more towards the positive..some people are expecting a finely crafted laptop for this low low price. You get what you pay for, but in this case, the low price buys you the a basic machine, created with a great deal of thought about the features. I will update my review as time goes on. I am hoping I will not have function failure as others have reviewed after using for awhile. The sticking \"f\" key is really, really annoying.UPDATE #1: Spent a lot of time using the Chromebook last night and have decided the sticking \"f\" key is not something I can live with. So I am exchanging it for another one. Amazon customer returns NEVER disappoints...the return process is beyond easy. The CS representative was friendly and helpful, and easy to understand as English was her primary language, unlike most other CS online experiences I'm encountering lately for other companies. Amazon will overnight ship a replacement Chromebook at no cost to me, and will email me a return label also at no cost to ship the package back. And, they are not waiting for the defective item to arrive before sending the new one. What's not to love about Amazon? Seriously...Also noticed that in the advanced Chromebook settings, there is a way to \"wipe\" the machine back to factory settings. I really appreciate how basically user friendly this machine seems to be. Not quite the same as an apple device, they practically reach thru the display and guide your hand to what you want to do, but easy...one of the reasons I did not want a small windows laptop or netbook was how unintuitive it is to do what you need to do even for simple setting changes or adjustments. I find myself totally frustrated when I go back to using my DELL laptop after my Ipad because of the Windows platform with a million windows to click through. I'm glad Google has come up with what I hope continues to be a very respectable alternate for basic functions (please, I'm not a tekkie so don't jump on this, want a small basic machine that won't get bogged down with the issues a Windows machine experiences) I'm hoping I can also use Chromebook away from my home wifi, using my iphone as a hotspot so I can take advantage of using the internet on a larger display. Originally I had an android smart phone, a samsung galaxy Fascinate with a nice large display. I switched to an iphone 4 and was not thrilled with the small screen, even though I like most everything else. I've really wrestled with the decision to switch back to either a samsung NOTEII or GalaxyIII  for a larger screen, but now with the Chromebook tethered to my own hotspot,I'm rethinking that.Yes, it will use data, but I don't stream music, play games or videos on 3g data so I end up with more than enough data each month(Verizon) Will update again next month unless there are \"issues\" with the new machine.Update #2 April 13, 2013: My replacement Chromebook arrived yesterday as promised with overnight delivery. No problems with the keyboard keys sticking as I experienced with the first one. Fast set up again out of the box. First interesting observation,no juice...I had to charge it right away...the first Chromebook arrived with a partial charge..hmmmm...with first one thought, \"oh, thoughtful to have that ready to go\" Now thinking it was returned by someone else for the sticking f key. It charges quickly so not really a problem, plugged in (again, silly little charging dongle) and went thru set up, choosing my wireless connection. First hiccup, the wireless kept going off, trying to default to neighbors' appearing in the list...this did not happen the first time...Re-booted, and wireless was OFF again.Connected, but didn't stay connected. Starting to worry. I am not tech trained, but I do know some things. Clicked on the wireless icon and went into the wireless settings and saw that the box for \"automatically connect to this network\" was UNCHECKED. Another hmmm, first machine, that had no wireless staying on issues was NOT a new one when it came to me. Selected that option, now problem solved (I think) I shut the machine down  and came back to it awhile later, internet defaulted to my home connection right away A few things I don't know how to do, maybe someone else can help me, don't know how to get rid of APPS that I downloaded from the chrome store and,I chose several new themes, told me they were added, but I can't find them to select them...where did they go? After being used to the Ipad retina display, I agree that the resolution is underwhelming and increasing the brightness does help.Realistic expectations as we all have said, is the key to enjoying this machine.I'm still concerned that overtime,the Chrmbk will start having problems as noted in other reviews. I don't forsee heavy usage, wanted this machine as a low cost mini laptop traveling companion to my ipad3 and didn't want another tablet(android)So, the jury's still out. Added a 4th star because right now there is nothing to fault and I think performance is more than just mediocre if you accept it for what it is. I'm hopeful I didn't get one of the \"lemons\". We'll see how it goes over time.Update #3  May 2. Love using the Chromebook for Internet browsing and email. It is SO FAST on startup and battery life is exceptional. It also automatically converted an excel spreadsheet to chrome's equivalent..I have had no issues with it thus far, but it doesn't get sustained, hard use. I was able to pair it with both my printers, one HP eprint and a canon, thru the cloud..what more could I need?! I will be traveling with it mid month but don't expect any issues.Update #4 June 1st. Traveled with the Chromebook, no issues, was able to attach to new wireless connections without a problem. Back home and Still using it happily with no issues...the simplicity of it is what makes it so useful. Grab and get on. I needed to use my 17\" Dell laptop this weekend and there were frequent browser crashes, and it is just not intuitive to use when you get used to the Chromebook and an ipad. Wish the resolution could be a litle sharper, but as I have said in the past...low price, low expectations = satisfaction. If I want to see a stunning pix of something I can grab my ipad. Overall I believe this is a very useful machine if you don't bend the parameters!Update#5 July 6, 2013  still find great utility and versatility in the Chromebook. Have had no issues, have no buyer's regret. So glad to avoid the numerous \"issues\" that always arise when using my dell laptop, which has been updated and tuned up recently. I want to repeat,IMO, this machine is a SUPPLEMENT to having both a full featured Windows laptop and an Ipad3. I do not think you will be satisfied with it if it is your only computer. Not at this level Chromebook. But for my needs and the way I continue to use it, it has been perfect. Two new observations: it gets quite warm with prolonged use, but I have never had it shut down for overheating. I don't believe it has an internal fan. And, if using on your lap like I was this am enjoying coffee out on my lanai, the speakers get muffled a bit since they are located in the front underside corners...in the lid or above the keyboard would be better. When you are using the laptop on a solid surface, the non slip buttons in the four corners raise it up enough to leave the speakers unencumbered. The biggest negative I have found is the lack of a cap lock. There IS a keyboard shortcut for that, and I can never remember what it is without continually looking it up! Most of the time I just hold the shift button down and type what I need in boldface with one hand...but deciding not to include that is semi annoying from time to time.

It's very lightweight and easy to carry. It doesn't ever get warm. The ease of accessing the Internet is superb. The connection speed seems comparable to any other laptop on a connection with similar speed. I would caution if you typically keep 10-12 tabs open at the same time, there may be a little lag as you click on one you haven't visited in a while. The price can't be beat. There's a certain security in knowing that I could lose or break my Chromebook and not only would I not lose any data, but I could get a new one for such a low price.Some bad stuff...I really wish it had a longer lasting battery. My traditional laptop has a much stronger battery life. The sound just doesn't seem as robust as I would like it.

I flip-flopped about this for weeks, debating Chromebook vs. Nexus 7. I settled on the larger screen with a quality keyboard for the same price.If your lifestyle is like mine, where you can do most of your work on your home or work computer and maybe you have a high-end phone that fills in another big part of your technological needs, a Chromebook may be a good solution for you.99% of what I do syncs to the cloud, so it's nice to have the same files available at work, on my phone, or on my Chromebook.

I don't keep documents on my hard drive and most of my time spent on the computer is spent online. The Chromebook is all internet based where everything is run by the browser.

I like the fact that you don't have to worry about installing security updates and having to restart the computer. Everything is done for you in the background without you even knowing about it. I'm not kidding about  quick start up, it literally is 5 seconds or less for me.This computer does not have a CD bay, so if you are looking to burn CD's, a different computer should be available. It has USB ports and micro card readers for additional storage space since the computer hard disk is not capable of holding large amounts of data. However, if you are a Google user, you can utilize the free online storage to save files and access them from anywhere.The biggest question I get from my friends is how do you install a word or spreadsheet program. Easy, Google products have them available online for free. You can save the documents as a .doc or .exe file when needed.Overall, if you want an every day computer to complete the tasks above, this is a great buy for the money! If you are an avid Google products user, you will get the hang of it with a snap of the finger.

O'Donnell", "ReviewID": "R2YMM5W5SHRX52", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "We were really excited about this Chromebook. It's truly a beautiful machine. Very light. Very well designed generally and looks and feels much like a clone of a MacBook Air. Excellent keyboard. The Chrome operating system is what it is: a good idea for some people and maybe not really that terrific for others.Apparently, these little machines are flying off the shelves because we had to wait for ours for a while, even with a Prime purchase.Anyway, we were disappointed. We wanted so badly for it to work, it was quite the downer that it seems not quite ready for primetime. Or, to put it somewhat differently, it has a problem which a $250 consumer item shouldn't have: connectivity is very problematic.The short version of this is that a machine that requires that it be online for any significant functioning had better not have any issues about getting online. Ours did, and bad issues at that. In retrospect, we realize we disregarded warnings about connectivity, which appear quite frequently in reviews of this machine online. Of course, one never knows with such things what the level of expertise of the reviewer might be and all the time you see reviews essentially announcing that the reviewer is a complete novice and maybe should be asking his teenage son how to do things instead of complaining about the item being reviewed.Our home is served by an recent Airport Extreme wireless router. There are many items connected and none have ever had a problem. Indeed, my students will frequently visit our house with their many varied laptops and none of them has ever had a problem connecting to the system. But this Chromebook refused completely. By the way, it had no trouble at all with connecting to our neighbors unprotected network through walls and down the street so if it's a hardware issue it certainly isn't a simple one of an obviously defective part.My wife works in IT tech support so she toyed with the idea of taking our network apart to find what sort of gremlin might be locking out this one machine out of all the dozens that have connected flawlessly. Of course it was my spousal responsibility to be sure that she would be able to do that successfully, but that left me wondering about whether I could just take her along wherever I took the machine, to fix up similar mysterious refusals to connect.I don't want to seem cranky about this, since we both really liked the machine and even though we packed it up and sent it back to Amazon, our plan is to lurk, giving Samsung and Chrome a bit more time to bring their product up to speed. Then we'll try again. But, for right now our verdict is that a machine aimed at the low end consumer market shouldn't have even the slightest issue of the sort we encountered.Oh, we aren't claiming that our experience is typical. We didn't push deeply into our configuration. We certainly didn't remap our entire network or pull items off one by one etc etc. The point, again, is that no one should have to do that for an always online consumer laptop.", "Date": "March 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive, simple-to-use super light laptop", "Author": "John W.

Overall, I am extremely satisfied. As many have said, the battery life is great (I dont even carry my charger often), its suuuper light weight (but get a carrier), pretty speedy, and the limitations it has in terms of \"normal\" use are pretty minimal.But, some things I wish I knew before I bought it:1) It is advertised as being able to open any document that's originally a Word/Excel/Powerpoint etc. file. Not true. It opens all of these file types, but I've struggled with not being able to open larger files. As a teacher, I haven't been able to open student grade reports and files that are sizable. If the majority of the work you do is in larger files, this probably isn't the machine for you. Not as big of a deal for me, but still something to mention, is that formatting definitely shifts when you open things in Word and try to edit them.2) It is difficult to use two accounts at one time on the Chromebook. I have a Google account for work and one for personal use. I have to log out of the current user just to check a quick email on the other. While I know I can forward one email to the other I can prefer to keep them separate which is difficult on the Chromebook.3) If you use Outlook at all, the Chromebook is difficult. It only allows you to use the 'lite' version of the web version which is so basic that is almost unusable. Since I communicate regularly with people who use Outlook as their main form of email, I have to use another computer just to send a meeting maker or whatever the case may be.Other than those two big notes, I'd recommend it.

I was drawn to the design of the Chromebook.  It is very similar in design to the Macbook Air 11\"  However it is certainly not a Macbook Air.  It feels heavier, although I didn't actually compare the weight.  It is definately thicker than an Air, and not as solid since it is plastic.  This brings me to my main issue, and why I only give it 4 starts instead of 5.  The trackpad is a great size, and has some swipe capability, although for some reason it basically limited to scrolling.  The issue, at least with mine, is that when you use this on your lap on the couch the body flexes enough while you type to create nuisance clicks with the touch pad.  I can literally flex the palm rests and the mouse will click.  The touch pad on mine is not quite even, so perhaps it is simply a defect.  The battery life is pretty good, I was so frustrated by the touchpad that I honestly haven't determined the run time of the battery.  I will say though, that it does kill the battery over time in sleep mode.  I closed the lid with about 50% battery left, and when I picked it up again to use it three days later the battery was dead.  I love the fact that it has a USB port and an HDMI port.  It think in time the OS will be even more functional, and if my touch pad is defective my main issue with the Chromebook would be no issue for most people.  If this is how the touchpad actually works, well then I give it ZERO stars.  It is so frustrating to use with the touchpad like this, that I could not possibly suggest it to anyone.

I called Samsung support, and they have arranged for me to send it back for repair.  Not a good experience so far.Update:My Chrombook stopped working after just two weeks.  I called Samsung support.  They asked me to try a reset, but the Chromebook was still dead.  So, they gave me a repair ticket number and a UPS shipping label.  I was told to include the power supply when shipping the unit in for repair.  I was glad that I kept the original packaging, which included the oblong internal box for the power supply.  The power supply is a bit large, since it is a brick design, and the internal oblong box ensures that it fits properly in the carton for shipping.The response I got via email was that the warranty was voided because I used the wrong power supply.  Included in the email was a photo of a power supply I had never seen before.  It was not a brick-type supply at all, but instead one of those smaller power supplies used with the old style cell phones.  I called to dispute this.  The person I talked to was a Samsung employee.  She put me on hold while she communicated by dispute with Intellisol. She then emailed me screenshots from a video that Intellisol had made when the technician opened the carton I had shipped.  These two screen shots clearly showed the incorrect power supply.  The only problem is that I did not ship them this incorrect power supply.  I shipped the power supply I received with the system.  So, I don't know whose box they were opening when they took the video, and how that video got associated with my unit.  At that point, I had nothing to say, since it was my word against Intellisol's video screen shots.  I asked how much it would cost to repair the unit, and was told $200.  I did not want to invest any more money in this Chromebook, so I asked them to sent it back to me un-repaired.  When I received it, it was operational!  However, they included the bad power supply, which I had never seen before in my life.  Now, I have a functional Chromebook but without  the correct power supply.

To me it's almost instantaneous!*  The screen is bright but the color is a little washed out.*  Keyboard is fantastic but missing cap lock?!  There are a ton of keyboard short-cuts (remember WordPrefect?  Yeah, it's like that!)*  Touchpad is decent but has no buttons.  The gestures are a little different than Windows/Mac.  Will take some getting use to.*  Light weight because of mostly plastic materials.  Doesn't scream cheap but it may not hold up too well in the long run.  However I do love the design.*  The screen hinge is on top so the screen won't open all the way flat (viewing angle is still good thou).*  Battery charges fully in about 2 hours and last about 4 hours watching mostly videos.*  Video runs smoothly.*  Great WIFI antenna.*  Gets a little warm sitting on the lap.For me, both the Apple iPad and the Android tablets failed to become my full-time computer replacement.

However, I can definitely say that I now spend ~80% of my computing time on my Chromebook. It's fast, lightweight, and long-lasting (battery wise). Considering that most of us now spend most of our time using the computer to use the internet, why wouldn't I use my Chromebook? I still chuckle at people who cry out \"BUT IT CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT THE INTERNETS!\" Let's be honest: how often do you use your computer for non-internet related things? That's right. I thought so. Take that, average computer user.So yes, I really do love my Chromebook. I don't regret my purchase at all. $250 was a steal for this product, as far as I'm concerned (and I'm a broke college student). It was especially vital in allowing me to successfully write my ~100pg undergraduate thesis, as the portability allowed me to work everywhere (my room, Starbucks, friends' rooms, library, professor's office, etc.).Cons: Yes, there are a few downsides. (1) Build quality is shoddy. Which I guess is a given, given the price. The paint is starting to come off, especially near where I rest my wrists. I also make sure to pick it up carefully, as the base feels a little 'loose' and I worry that it could split in half. I recommend closing and picking it up when you have to do so.(2) Ram. Yup, I'm still spoiled by laptop/desktop usage. The Chromebook definitely can't handle 50 open tabs without freezing/crashing. There is occasional lag depending on the intensity of whatever you're trying to run.Overall: A+ would recommend. Cheap laptop supplement. Google is great about pushing out frequent Chrome OS updates, and it's safe to say that my device runs even better than it did when I first got it.

Using Google Drive to take notes works PERFECTLY, plus everything is automatically backed up.  It's also very easy to download documents to and from your main computer.

Sutton", "ReviewID": "R2JDX3B8ZZN9OL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I recently decided that we needed to replace the two laptops in our house, as my 5 year old Dell was too big and bulky to carry around and remain portable.  For my wife, we purchased a large HP laptop - she wanted a large screen, huge keyboard, and Windows 8.  For me though, I had completely different needs.  I use my iPad for as many applications as I possibly can when I'm at home.  I do use it for games, but I also use it for basic browsing, remote access to my desktop computer, and accessing files via programs like Evernote and Sugar Sync.For someone that has no other way of doing things like word processing or running computer programs, the Chromebook could pose some potential problems.  But, for someone like myself, who already has a desktop, a work laptop, an iPad, and a smartphone, those things were not important.  What I was initially looking at was the Macbook Air.  I loved the size and weight of the Air, something extremely portable that picks up where my other devices left off.  Unfortunately, the price tag of the Macbook Air is nearly four times that of the Chromebook.  So, as I browsed around further, I located two Chromebooks - both of which seemed to be meet my needs.The first was the Acer Chromebook, which runs around $199, and has similar specs to the Samsung, however it has a larger hard drive that is not solid state.  The basic difference with the Samsung was the addition of the solid state drive.  Because my goal was portability and something that I could use in my lap, I went with the Samsung.  Despite being a smaller hard drive, it allows the Samsung to run quietly and it does not heat up.So, how does it function?  In a word - great.  You cannot tell me that you can find a better laptop for $250.  It boots up in seconds, I only have to charge it once or twice a week with steady use, and it does everything that I need it to.  If I need to run iTunes or a Windows program, I do have to go to my desktop computer, but I don't do so very often.  If you leverage the available apps properly, you can listen to music via Pandora and Spotify, which eliminates the need for iTunes (aside from syncing, which again would need a Windows or Mac based computer) and watch movies and shows on Netflix.  There are also a bevy of games available to keep you entertained.  What I use it for though is web browsing.  I can access webpages faster on this pint-sized device than I can on any other computer or device that I own.So, if you didn't read the rest of the review...Pros:-Size/portability-Speed-Battery life-Solid state drive (quiet and stays cool)-Cost-Variety of apps designed for it-Touchpad-Google drive storage makes up for small hard driveCons:-Offline functionality is limited-Google Docs conversions to and from Microsoft applications can sometimes be challenging-Limited file compatibility (video and audio files)-Poor video playback (but I don't use it for that)Overall, a great laptop at a great price point, perfect for students or folks that just need to get on the internet and in a hurry.

You can listen to ur music but my advice is to get a better mp3 player on the chrome store as you can't use the original one for customizing with playlists and so on. You get free space on google drive however it doesn't automatically end up on your account, you have to activate it whenever you're ready. It's ultra light and sleek so it's good for dragging to school and also cheap so if anything was to happen to it...at least it wasn't a mac book. Over all it's really nice, no fan, runs quietly, no overheating. It doesn't have a caps lock button :/ but that doesn't really bother me. It might just have a shortcut to use it but haven't looked for that yet. Surfing the net is great and again...it's so darn light. Only thing I don't like is the fact that as long as someone has a google account, they can add user and sign in so be careful as it can be stolen easily and secondly, it restarts automatically for updates. So u'll be doing work or watching a video and the screen would blank out to update which is like literally 2 seconds. Good thing is that the work is saved already so you don't lose it and everything that was open at the time automatically reopens. The updates don't happen that often. It just gets annoying when u're watching a movie cuz it starts over and u have to skip through lol. I would definitely look past that minor problem and refer this to a friend which I have already done so get one if u're thinking about it.", "Date": "August 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Fit!", "Author": "Annaliese", "ReviewID": "R3V80SM3O6BIT5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was looking for a simple computer to do the most basic functions (i.e. web surfing, blogging, document creation, etc.) and this was a slam dunk.

Over the last year or so I've become a heavy user of Google Docs, which is now part of Google Drive. I finally got around to picking this up thanks to the decent reviews and low price as an experimental toy for writing. I'm a believer now. What the Samsung Chromebook does, it does well.Pros:Very good chiclet style keyboard.Great battery life - I got a little over six and a half hours on wifi with the screen at nearly full brightness. That was just writing with a little web surfing. I don't know how much impact streaming video will have yet.Quiet and cool.Thin and light but it still feels fairly solid. I wouldn't want to drop it, but it feels more substantial than my two year old netbook.I like the idea that I can lend this to a visiting friend and they could sign in using their own Google account or anonymously if they don't have one and my stuff would be walled off from them. I haven't tried this out yet, but I like the idea of it.Low maintenance. Some piece of software or the OS on my windows PC is constantly nagging me for an update. Chrome updates automatically, silently, and in the background unless you decide to change that behavior manually.Cons:This isn't a general purpose machine. I still need a \"real PC\" for some software I use regularly. (Photoshop, a few Java programs, and to view video files.)Limited file type support for video media. You can save video to the machine for viewing but file format support is beyond primitive. If you have a large collection of media there's probably very little in there that will work without conversion on another machine. You can upload it to Google Drive and see if you can then view it through that interface, but that's unintuitive and a pretty inelegant solution.Neutral:The trackpad is responsive, but I miss having trackpad buttons. It was simple enough to learn how to use it though.I knew these limitations before I purchased this machine, and they don't bother me. I bought this Chromebook purely for a little web surfing and a writing machine. For these purposes, it works exactly as advertised.Update: 12/15/2013Just a FAQ, based on the most common questions people seem to ask.1: Does Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Instant Video, HBO GO, work? Yes. They all work fine. Some people have reported an issue with choppy video when using HBO Go, but I haven't replicated that. All work fine for me.2: Can I install Office, Skype, etc? No. This machine runs Chrome OS. Everything runs in the browser. It does not run executable software designed for Windows or Mac OSX. If you can run it in the Chrome web browser, it will work on a Chromebook (with the exception of software which needs the silverlight plugin or Java.)3: Will it run Minecraft? No. Minecraft requires Java.4: How is the battery life? My battery manages five to six hours of continuous usage, but I always run full brightness and stream video as I like.5: Can I use a mouse? Yes. Wired USB, wireless, and Bluetooth mice work fine.6: Can I connect a printer to this Chromebook? Not in the traditional way. You must get a Google Cloud Print Ready printer or share one connected in the traditional way to a PC using Google Cloud Connect.7: Is Google Drive compatible with Office? Yes, you can read and edit Word and Excel files using Google Docs and Sheets. You can freely convert Docs and Sheets files to Office format as well, although Google Drive does not support every Office function.8: Can I control what websites an account may view? Yes. Google calls this a Supervised User Account.9: Does it work offline? Yes. Many things including the creation or editing of Docs and Sheets files may be done offline, but you must enable this first.10: Can I run iTunes on this? No. iTunes does not run in a web browser. You can't install Windows or OSX executables on Chrome OS. You can import your iTunes library into Google Play Music (up to 30,000 songs for free), but you must do so on a PC.11: Will this work with my iPhone? You may charge your iPhone, Android, or similar phone, but there is no management software available from the web browser as far as I know.12: Does it play DVDs or CDs? No. It does not include an optical drive.13: Does it have an ethernet port? No. It has wifi. There is also a model available which has wifi and 3G. No physical port.14: Does it have an SD Card reader? Yes.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung Chromebook (Wi-Fi, 11.6-Inch)", "Author": "SJW", "ReviewID": "RT0YE1VYY7N4I", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Had to get my son a new laptop but needed to keep cost down and he only uses it for school, surfing the web, email and Netflix.It's a solid little rig that boots fast, long battery life (compared to his previous Toshiba) and light enough to take to school.For a simple, inexpensive laptop that does the basics...this is a good buy so far and we are a few months in.", "Date": "March 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Back to the Future", "Author": "Austin Barry \"Austin\"", "ReviewID": "RORXGXHBQ2GOJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Update - decided to keep it and give it another star.First of all, I might say that I'm a little indifferent to the Chromebook - hence the  (original) 3 star rating.  I have the last return date circled in my calendar, and have the bubble wrap and box all ready to go.  Meanwhile I'll try to find out where it fits (if anywhere) in my computer collection, and if I can adapt to the Chromebook world.  If I keep it, I'll give it another star.Years ago, when you used a computer to do serious work, you used a terminal connected to a larger computer.  An unconnected terminal (even an \"intelligent terminal\") didn't do much on its own.  It was a rather care-free life.  If you terminal stopped working, you simply found another one and picked up where you left off.  Viruses (at an individual level) were unheard of.  I think of the Chromebook is a modern interpretation of the terminal.  You get all the advantages (statelessness, no individual viruses, no software to install, no maintenance), but it needs to be connected, and your experience is only as good as what is on the other end.First of all, the hardware is top notch.  I could easily give it 5 stars.  It's silent, lightweight but solid, and the display is very good.  Battery life seems to be better than most laptops, but not quite as good as an iPad.  In terms of performance, I'd say it's better than any Windows machine near this price range.  My favorite test is scrolling rapidly through a Facebook news feed.  It's almost as fast as a high-powered Mac.The software/OS is basically a web browser with a LIMITED set of plug-ins.  unlike an iPad, you have Flash available, and there is some magic to allow you to save a few things off-line, access external drives, etc.  Apart from that, you probably can't install plugins.  The Java site says I don't have Java, but Wikipedia sound clips work (yay).One amazing feature is remote desktop access.  I can barely read what I'm typing, but I'm typing this on my chromebook connected to my mac. I think this just made the keep decision.Although you can minimize the web browser, there doesn't seem to be much point.  There is an \"app store\", and the most common price seems to be \"free\".  \"Bookmark store\" might be a better term (a \"bookmark store\" is a great improvement over one well-known browsers habit of simply filling your bookmarks with its choice of bookmarks).  Some apps (such as Evernote) are simply the same as the web interface available to everyone.  Email is limited to web-based email (luckily most email providers and corporate email servers provide (usually awkward web based interface).  A few \"apps\" seem quite pointless - such as a \"wikipedia\" app which does nothing but display ads in the margin while you read genuine Wikipedia articles with the margins cut off.  Google maps is the same as the awkward web version (two-fingered scroll = zoom, scrolling means clicking on the little compass circle).  Many Google \"apps\" create several tabs for simple operations.  For example, reading a book via Google Play may open 3 tabs (only one of them is the book).  This can get a little confusing. Then again, the whole tabbed interface avoids the issues of having multiple programs open, each with its own tabbed interface.Finally - (despite the hype, but true to the fine print) offline behavior is currently VERY limited.  I was able to edit a Google Doc (Google Docs are kept off-line) without wifi, and the document synced as soon as I was back within wifi range.  Perhaps other sites will gradually acquire Chromebook off-line behavior, but for now don't expect to work offline and pop into your local cafe for a quick cup of coffee and daily sync.  The good news is that you can \"try out\" the Chromebook experience using any type of computer that runs Google Chrome.

And there are also websites that restrict content from tablets, like Hulu.com.

However, the machine is not invincible and will start to struggle if you open about 10 or more content heavy websites.My favorite feature on the Chrome browser is the \"Chrome Remote Desktop\" application.  It makes it easy for you to control a computer at home remotely with your Chromebook through the internet.  It is easy to set up and it works great (as long as you have a decent internet connection wherever you are).  So if you need a powerful machine, you can just use the Chromebook to access and do work on a more powerful desktop while on the go.  I use my Chromebook to work on Matlab projects on my home desktop while I'm at college.Of course this machine is almost useless without internet connection, but isn't that true of tablets as well?  You can still watch movies, listen to music, and play games that are stored locally on the hard drive or on an external drive.My main gripe with Chromebook is the lack of applications.  I use this machine for college, and I have a lot of content on PDF files to study.  The standard PDF viewer in Chrome is very basic.

(While I originally considered an ultra-book, I decided to keep separate applications with sensitive data like Quicken from other cloud-based documents. Based on that concern, I elected to maintain a home-based laptop and to buy the Chrome Book for on the go.) At $249, you cannot beat the price for the Chrome Book.The Chrome Book is extremely light-weight (~2 pounds) and meets my standards for portability. The keyboard is very comfortable and easier to use than a touch screen with either a stylus or an add-on keyboard. (I admit that I find it challenging to type on a touch screen and that I don't like fingerprints.) The device looks stylish.From a set-up perspective, it is important to ensure that your wi-fi encryption is set to WPA2. (Our router was originally set to use the older standard of WEP.) When I first turned on the Chrome Book, the device was extremely slow - taking many minutes to access a web page. As soon as I changed the encryption standard, the Chrome Book speed became good and responsive. If you are currently using WPA2, set-up is as easy as turning on the device and signing into Gmail.If you don't have wi-fi access, the Chrome Book does allow you off-line access to both Gmail and Google Drive.To gain full utility from this device, you need to buy-in to using Gmail and Google Drive. (You can access MS Office docs on a flash drive.) I have been impressed by the collaboration capabilities with Documents on Drive. (If you are committed to using Outlook or another reader to access your mail locally, the Chrome Book will NOT work for you.)Google makes available 100GB of storage on Drive for 2 years if you buy a Chrome Book. In order to take advantage of this storage, you need to search for Chrome Book \"goodies\" online.A disappointment with the Chrome Book is that you cannot access the New York Times application with off-line availability. (You can sign in and read the NY Times with the Skimmer application. You need wi-fi connectivity to use the Skimmer.) While I pay for an online Times subscription, the Chrome tablet application will not work. Every time you try to access an article, it prompts you to log-in but it then routes you back to the home page instead of opening the article. (If you look at the reviews on the Chrome Store web site, many users report the same problem.)While the Kindle Cloud application will allow you to access your newest book via the Chrome Book, it will not allow you to access your subscriptions.)I think this is a good device if you want a portable gadget for office functionality.

This is a great small, light laptop that's great use when lounging on the couch or to travel with, especially when your main focus is to simply browse the web. There are certainly other useful ways to use this (games and apps), but I think the target audience here are people that prefer to browse the web on a device with a keyboard (which sets this apart from a tablet), and may use it for other tasks sporadically.The one issue I have is that I tend to have \"heavy hands\" when I type or use the track pad. By this, I mean that I put a lot of weight on the palms of my hands on each side of the track pad (below the keys). I use a 13\" macbook as my main computer and this has never been an issue; however, with the plastic construction, this is an issue with the chromebook.The issue is when I use the track pad with my right hand. I leave my left palm resting to the left of the track pad and when I do, \"clicking\" the trackpad by pressing down doesn't work. There is a software feature which allows you to tap the mouse for clicks, but the issue I'm talking about is the physical click by depressing the track pad. The times this is most noticeable are the following:- When resting the laptop on a soft surface, such as your lap- When the laptop is on a hard surface, but the front of the laptop hangs over the edge a bit.- This is kind of hard to explain, but sometimes when I'm walking around with my laptop, I hold it with my left hand with my four fingers on the bottom of the left side, and my thumb on the top, squeezing on the laptop with a firm grip. This allows me to use the trackpad when I'm standing, walking around...  When holding the laptop like this, the trackpad click also fails. This is probably not a practice done my most people though :)* If the chromebook is on a hard surface (table) without hanging over the edge, this issue is not seen.What's more interesting is that this only happens if your hand is pressed down on the left side of the track pad. If you use your left hand to control the track pad, (with a heavy right hand), you won't notice this issue.I think having a macbook with it's aluminum unibody has given me bad habits because the construction is so solid, but when we're talking about a $1,500 price difference between the macbook and chromebook, I think it's understandable. The chromebook is a $250 laptop and you can't expect the construction to be on par with macbook. This is just a small annoyance and when it happens, I just have to remember to lift my left hand to allow the the track pad to work properly.Aside from that, I love the chromebook and find myself using it more than my macbook now because it's so light and convenient -- not to mention, you feel more comfortable casually carrying it around since you are less concerned with damaging an electronic device that is so cheap :).Sorry, one more thing -- There is no right-click with the chromebook -- you use a two finger click for a right-click functionality (one finger for left click). I like this, but when you are using multiple laptops, it's easy to forget.**** Update ****I have a terrible time streaming youtube vidoes which is why I'm assuming netflix is STILL not supported. Youtube definitely has its own issues, but I have streamed the same video side-by-side with my chromebook and macbook, and have no issues with the macbook. Furthermore, my download speed is 45mbps and upload is 5mbps, so this is not a bandwidth issue.You can pause the video and allow it to buffer (youtube only buffers so much so it may be necessary to pause several times while watching a video), but should that really be necessary? Chromebook has capable hardware, so this must be a software issue. They have fixed another major annoyance I had to deal with for a few weeks (chromebook wouldn't \"wake up\" when opening the lid and a hard reboot was necessary).

This is fixed by removing the charger, shutting the lid, and then re-opening the lid. It's a minor inconvenience but it is still a gripe.Secondly, after about 14 months of owning the product the screen is starting to get fuzzy. This again is easily fixed by changing the angle of the monitor until the fuzzy screen disappears. A minor complaint but still something that often gets in the way.The chromebook landscape is (thankfully) a very fluid hardware market and at this point I would recommend to buy another chromebook elsewhere. After a year of using ChromeOS I'm excited at the prospect of buying another chromebook, however, I'm still waiting until this one dies.

I called them, explained that I honestly had no clue as to how the LCD could be damaged with no exterior damage and offered to send photos, they told me to reset the computer and that it was a software issue......... um....no. Anyways, the computer itself has a great battery life, runs most sites that I use, but I do experience issues. If you are using this computer for business and not just for occasional college papers, netflix or the internet, I would not advise you to purchase it. It depends upon internet a lot of the time (although I can access files, offline drive, etc. without it sometimes) it does require it to do a lot of stuff. The free 160GB of free cloud storage comes in handy, and you can access your files from any source. Very light weight, compact, lovely interface, etc. Great for college students. Just make sure if you need certain programs you see if they are compatible with google's operating system. There is no Microsoft Word, Excel, etc. It's all google docs. and sometimes you can't open files. Make sure you are comfortable with file formatting, pdf.'s, etc. Easy to get used to, even though this review is quite long, haha.

Lastly ,The Acer set up quickly on her ATT wifi, I had to call comcast help desk to get the Samsung to work.

The absence of the caps lock key (I can't even write caps in caps because there is no caps lock key). It is possible that this caps lock key, which has been a mainstay of all keyboards is just re-assigned somewhere else, but it is a huge problem for people that type often and count on their typing and muscle memory, etc and depend on the caps lock key being there by my left pinky. Since it is not there, when I press that key it opens up a \"search\" or \"windows\" key. It's stupid and I hate it. Getting this back to a caps lock key is essential if google wants people to migrate from being pc or windows or macbook consumers to being chromebook consumers.

I went through the steps on my mac to configure the printer and share it with my son's account so that he could print. For some reason I couldn't get it to work (but was able to follow the steps pretty easily), he still could not print.  So ok, maybe that is just a technical issue that can be resolved, but read below.Also it is unclear but I'm fairly certain this other computer (used to configure the printer) has to actually be on and in the house. So that is a big drawback especially since my printer is a laptop I carry with me. So the chromebook could be home and I could be out and my son won't be able to print (even if we solved the technical issue in paragraph 1).So bottom line is that printing is an issue. To get around this, for a paper my son had to hand in at school, he wrote it on his chromebook, shared it with me via Google docs and I opened it on my mac and printed it. Not ideal.Still I'm giving it 4 stars since printing isn't done that much these days and in general it is working well for my son and his school assignments which he does on Google Docs.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Super and affordable", "Author": "ray", "ReviewID": "R1DRUCP68XGXD0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Never so happy with a new computer.Works great never any issues.Would highly recommend as long as you can see OK on a smaller screen.", "Date": "January 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Key function not functioning.", "Author": "phisllo", "ReviewID": "R3SM4HHRNZ17RE", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This device had troubles connecting to wireless networks and keeping connectivity.

You can use gchat, but your friends have to have an account as well.I just purchased my second Chromebook.  I find that it has a tendency to crash, probably from over-heating.  My other Chromebook never did this.  Mostly the new one seems to have trouble with a particular bit of game software I downloaded.  However, I've never lost any data (everything stores in Cloud, and I can access it all from either computer.)Overall, I have to say that I recommend this machine over any other computer I've ever owned.

I needed a lightweight laptop, but couldn't afford the higher end 3lb. models. I found the Chromebook and decided to ask people how it was; my girlfriend has one and after using hers for a while I decided I'd get it.I'll lay out pros and cons. Remember, I'm reviewing this as a graduate student. If you plan on substituting for a PC or Mac, I caution you to understand it doesn't replace those.Pros:Lightweight. Can carry anywhere; less than 3 lbs. is insanely small and easy to fit in a bookbag.Google Chrome OS. Apparently this means no viruses, which is great. Runs smoothly since you're only using the internet (mostly.) Interface is good and everything loads fast.Google Drive. I love drive for group projects and writing notes. Also for reading PDFs and organizing files. It's almost like Office... almost.Comfortable design. Typing on this thing is a breeze. The screen is small but definitely easy to see and read. It's great for watching netflix or reading a book since you can just plop it on your lap while lying down.Cons:No Office. Google Drive is not office. This means that editing something here is not going to download to your PC or Mac the same. Although some times it does, especially in PDF format, and Google seems to be working on an Office Beta prototype. Still, Office is the best around. Drive is great, though, don't get me wrong on that.Everything is connected to the internet. This means that when you listen to spotify, you can only do so if connected (no saved files.) Also, basically everything ceases to function without the internet. Put it this way: without internet, this thing doesn't work.Aside from the cons, this is an excellent machine. Where do you go nowadays that doesn't have internet? People use their laptops at home and starbucks, on campus and in libraries. All have wifi. For the price, it's worth it, especially if you're in college. For anyone not in college, it's great if your laptop breaks, you need a second machine, or if you just want to go online and watch movies/listen to music.Highly recommend!", "Date": "January 7, 2014"}, {"Title": "happy with the chromebook", "Author": "James Moore", "ReviewID": "RP7ZK4MG7ZVKH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Samsung has always delivered a quality product.

All in all, it is very good. Not excellent, but very good. The pros: it turns on in only a few seconds, it is super light, the battery life is wonderful, I can write documents on Google Docs and do all the interneting I need to. The cons: it is definitely not a laptop. Google Docs and all the other Word-analogous programs are ok, but inferior to Word. There are just so many little things that Google Docs cannot do. I can't figure out how to make my default text anything besides Ariel size 11. I can't copy and paste more than one image at once. If I export a Google Doc as a Word Doc, the margins will be messed up. And, most frustratingly, somehow Times New Roman size 12 font is larger in Google Docs than it is in Microsoft Word, because if I copy and paste something it'll be a different length. Also, be warned: Google Spreadsheets are FAR inferior to Excel. They cannot do trend lines, which is kind of the most important thing that a spreadsheet analysis program does (for me, at least), so that's unfortunate. Google Drive will just NOT sync with my files on my laptop, even when I let it upload for hours and it says it's finished. I have to upload everything directly with Chrome, I can't rely on putting files in the folder that shows up in the My Computer tab. For some reason my mouse will disappear periodically and it takes a few minutes of frantic clicking and/or typing before it will reappear. And my Chromebook is only three months old. Basically, what I've had to do is cut back my real laptop use to just Excel and other programs I need for work, and then use the Chromebook for all the internet and writing I have to do. Which is working fine, and definitely hurt my wallet less than a new computer would have. The Chromebook is great for carrying around and using on the go. But it is not a computer, and the limited functions it has probably don't cut it (as the only computer-like device) for a lot of people these days. The Chromebook probably would be great for kids or older people who only need word processing and the internet though.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great, with some flaws", "Author": "Hi Desert", "ReviewID": "R1HK346N8VH99H", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this computer to use for taking online college classes. The speed of the wifi, ease of setup (really, there's essentially no setup), battery life, and price are exceptional. The keyboard is good -- nice satisfying feel, although not on part with a desktop's keyboard. In general I've found the system easy to use, but there are a few exasperating things about Chrome that will pop up now and again and leave me tearing out my hair. For instance: you can't access documents stored on the computer when you're offline (or maybe you can and I haven't figured it out yet). It's also difficult to find documents on the computer, say something that you downloaded. This system is obviously set up to work online, and only online. Google's apps like Sheet and Doc work pretty well, but if you're used to Microsoft you'll find that Google's products are generally awkward and slightly inferior reproductions. They do, however, work for all your basic needs and the free online storage lets me access them at home, work, wherever I can get online. If you can work exclusively online and need to surf the web, write basic documents, and want an inexpensive way to do it, this chromebook is a solid choice -- just not perfect. Lastly, I've been impressed by battery life -- I easily get 4-5 hours while typing or surfing the web.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "holli strong", "ReviewID": "R1X416D0J3VIYG", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great little computer! its  perfect for someone watching movies and just browing the web. my mom i a teacher and all of her students use them in school. really easy to use and portable", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fast and low cost", "Author": "Lonnie", "ReviewID": "RLBYB70GM5QV3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Very fast and  starts up immediately.

As long as you have an internet connection, this is a great device.  There is not a lot of storage on this device but the intent is to use Google Drive which stores everything out in the cloud (stores in the Google data center and you access over internet).  You can use an SD card to add more storage but was disappointed that the slot does not allow the card to be flush, therefore able to be left in all time.  There are some USB ports and the micro USB keys would work too.For those who are use to Windows and laptops with multiple mouse buttons, the glide pad will take some adjustment.  There is no button to push, and just left mouse click.Screen is clear and big enough to see everything.It has been dropped a few times and not damaged, minor scratches.

Free 100 gb google drive storage for 2 yrs is also very nice and I take full advantage of it by downloading hundreds of camera pictures when I travel. One feature that needs improvement is HDMI connectivity to external monitors and TV. This feature, when it works, allows watching youtube videos or mirroring chromebook screen directly on large screen TV or monitors. But lately with new chrome updates, this function got messed up and I can't do it anymore. I hope Google fixes this soon. Otherwise, this chromebook is a neat idea and give many people to own a light-weight, low-cost pc.", "Date": "July 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Gift!", "Author": "Steve", "ReviewID": "R2XLL6Y8ZPFT94", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this a gift for my wife for work.

However, they happen to be one of the most frequently returned computer products at BBY, because most people buy them without understanding what they are.Imagine a tablet with a physical keyboard and a mouse (rather than a touchscreen), a less brilliant display, and a less robust camera. The end.Incidentals:- Weighs about as much as a hardcover book- Chrome OS is rock solid and fast; it's about as unbreachable as anything out there.- Can take a sim card if there is no wifi around, but I wouldn't pay the extra $$ for that. Wifi is everywhere.- Tons of apps- Boots up in < 10 seconds- Has the most annoying sleep setting known to man, when it's running on the battery only. However, it is possible to manually run a script that will shut it off. Non-savvy people are not going to do that, though.- Has an SD slot and a couple of USB slots, which are plenty for copying over documents/photos, etc.- Google Drive is fantastic. Once I started using it, I was hooked. Can stream my own music and vids anywhere w/Google Play, etc. Don't have to waste time iUpdating some iNonsense.- Google Docs works well. Not as robust as MSOffice but it's free and easier than Open Office was (no installing, converting back and forth, etc.)That's about it in a nutshell.

In today's lingo you \"save\" 900$!And that's what 90% of Laptop users do with their laptops, just surf the internet.Basically this laptop is an \"internet terminal\".Everything is done in the browser; YES most things you can do in a browser BUT, the online apps still are not as good as downloadable software.e.g. Photoshop, Inkscape, etc. have online apps, \"RollApp\" being one of them.The online experience is not half as good or fast as when you simply have the software on your computer.On the other side, if you have liberated yourself from the garbage known as \"microsoft office\", and have already embraced google docs and the other excellent cloud products - then there is nothing holding you back in this laptop!It entirely depends on what you need:If you just want to surf the internet and use online apps, then THIS is the laptop of the future.Lightweight, I mean ridiculously light!HIGH battery life - Solid State harddrive! No more stupid spinning discs or fans to waste your battery.I get 6 hours out of one charge consistently.No data on the computer itself.This is the paradigm change you must get used too.Your data is in the cloud - which means in one way it is more secure, if you lose your computer , so what?The data isn't on it anyway, unless you insist on using the onboard SSD of only 16gb or an SD card/USB stick.However, if you have everything in the cloud, it is easier for the FBI, DHS or the American gov't to subpoena Google and get it. That's up to you and how much you trust our present day government, which I would say, shouldn't be much.With Moore's law still unstoppable, and SD cards of 32gb's and more I really think the argument about cloud storage or onboard storage is moot now. If you must have absolute security just augment the onboard storage with an SD card or USB stick.This computer is FAST!I don't want to surf in internet with anything else now. But not only internet is fast, it Boots up in less than 10 seconds.Switching users, Sleep, Restart, unsleep, etc. are so fast you won't believe it, there is no waiting at all.This saves massive amounts of time!And this is one of the biggest pluses I have experienced since I bought this chromebook.My productivity has shot up, just because of start and reboot times!This is a serious factor, for people, especially writers and bloggers, you will have a measurable positive effect.I really cringe when I have to use other slower systems e.g. at work etc.To sum up:This computer, imo really is the benchmark for the future.If we embrace the new paradigm of the cloud and not caring or even knowing where the data is actually stored, in return for amazingly fast performance in the internet and onboard (the OS is in the RAM only! Which enables the system speed, just like Puppy Linux) ---- OR do we cling to the old world of physically \"owning\" the data and every 2 years wasting our time on changing data mediums and transferring data and PAYING for data migration tools. Oh that brings up another rip-off - antivirus software:NOT NECESSARY IN THIS PARADIGM!Really can't believe how many people are wasting so many dollars on anti-virus software.I have been a linux user for over 10 years now, never wasted one penny on this BS known as anti-virus software, and the new Chromebooks will set you free from this rip-off, just another advantage....I predict the computer world will parallel the photography world in this change:There will always be a reason to use software that you install on your computer, like photoshop, just like there is still to this day real film cameras and real film still available. These kind of \"working computers\" are not replaceable, for industrial and professional requirements an \"internet\" or \"cloud\" computer cannot replace them.But for the main consumer, and 90% of computer usage,the new paradigm is undeniably the internet and the cloud.Write down your requirements and then buy the right tool for the right job.", "Date": "July 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "Screen usless after perhaps 50 hours of usage, Samsung REFUSES repair, claims physical damage not covered by the warranty", "Author": "S.E.

I couldn't get it to remain in place so I contacted Samsung support.  They couldn't mail a new key, it seems- they had me ship the entire machine to their New Jersey repair facility.  This was already a tremendous disappointment, but I returned everything to its box and drove it over to the UPS facility less than 48 hours after receiving it.  It arrived in NJ a few days later.  Today, I received a call from the facility.  There was a fault with the power supply (on this brand-new machine?) which was replaced free of charge. . . but the keyboard issue was considered \"physical damage\" and I would have to bear the cost of that repair.Since the repair facility is a 3rd party, I called Samsung directly, because this had to be mistake.  How is it reasonable that a brand-new machine, not abused in any way, would be subject to a paid repair in this kind of timeframe?  Despite their policies, I was sure they'd be willing to make this right once I explained how ridiculous it was.  Apparently not.  The representative escalated my call to \"executive service\", who reiterated their policy to me, and explained that there would be no accommodation.  I could choose to pay for the repair myself, or have the machine sent back to me without the repair.  She was more than happy to \"fully document\" my complaint but was unwilling to budge on the repair or \"speculate\" on what I could have done to cause it, or whether their response was reasonable given the circumstances.  Policy is policy.So keep in mind, my brand-new machine already had a repairable flaw out of the box, and developed a second one within hours of normal usage.

Without the screen, it is useless. So, ultimately, I paid $250 for 6 months of substandard computing.

Living in the clouds is possible just not sure the right option for me ... yet.", "Author": "Samuel J \"iNetSynch\"", "ReviewID": "R2BZR4DVIDU6LF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "For the last several months, my Toshiba Satellite laptop keyboard has been malfunctioning and I had begun searching for a replacement.  I had hoped to find the perfect hybrid Windows 8 tablet but was sidetracked when I read page after page of positive Chromebook reviews.  I purchased my Samsung Chromebook at the local Best Buy fully expecting to be wowed and to quickly fall in love with it.After two days of working with it, I wouldn't say that I'm in love with it nor could I say that the concept of using a glorified browser and cloud services seems as preposterous as I had once imagined.  As many have noted, the good keyboard, respectable build quality and lightweight make a positive first impression.  The track pad makes a less favorable impression.I discovered after a great deal of frustration that it does not support two finger tap gestures.  The Chromebook help screen claims that tapping with two fingers simulates a right click.  I incorrectly assumed that Google docs did not support spelling suggestions. When I tried to right-click on misspelled words, nothing happened and I was almost ready to box it up and return it to Best Buy.  After some searching on the Internet, I discovered that the Samsung Chromebook requires you hold down the Alt key while tapping to right-click.  I often found myself wanting to reach out and touch the screen because scrolling is so tedious.(See update below for correction to this comment.)When compared with competing Chromebooks, the display leaves much to desire but as others have noted the matte finish compensates enough to save it from a deal killer rating.  I have yet to get a handle on how much battery life to expect but it certainly exceeds the 2 -3 hours I get when using my Toshiba.Others have been impressed with the \"Instant On\" Chrome OS but as a Windows 8 user, I am less impressed.  I've grown accustomed to my Windows 8 computers being available for use within seconds of switching them on.  However, I am impressed by the quality of audio produced using the built in speakers.  As with the display, the sound is a bit muddy but better than what I am accustomed to when using portable devices.A major disappointment is the lack of support for Bluetooth audio devices.  I often use my LG Bluetooth headset to listen to streamed podcasts and music.  Strangely, the LG device is displayed after it's been turned off but disappears when I turn it on and try to connect.  None of my 4 Bluetooth audio headsets will work with the Samsung Chromebook.  The lack of audio Bluetooth support is close to being a deal breaker.  I recently purchased an analog to Bluetooth adapter and I suppose I can use it as a work around but that is certainly far from ideal. A second disappointment is lack of support for Netflix. I understand a fix is in the works but if not forthcoming within the 30 day returned period, I will return the Chromebook and continue my search for the perfect Windows 8 hybrid tablet / laptop.For me the jury is still out as to whether I will keep the device.  I continue to bump into limitations that may be more peculiar to my usage habits than to the targeted audience for this device.  Three prime examples are the lack of support for Skype, voice recognition, and Microsoft office suite.  I had not used Google docs prior to purchasing the Chromebook and I am still trying to decide if I can use it is a portable replacement for my much-loved Microsoft alternatives.Bottom line: I am impressed with how functional the device is and suspect Chrome OS is here to stay and will negatively affect the bottom line of both Microsoft and Apple.The success of Android and now Chromebook OS go a long way to vindicate my Linux friends who have long predicted Linux on my desktop.Update: A. Dightam wrote to correct my claim that two finger tapping did not simulate a right click. He was right and after a bit of two finger tap, tap, tapping it works like a charm.I used my analog to Bluetooth adapter to connect to my favorite Bluetooth headset and it worked as expected. I have my fingers crossed native support for Bluetooth audio is in the works.I have tested two USB devices. My USB Xbox Vision webcam works with the camera app. Frame rate is disappointing but happy to see I have at least one alternative to the built-in camera. In anticipation of Netflix support, I connected my wireless Lenovo Multimedia Remote Keyboard and it worked flawlessly. Unlike Apple and Windows device installs, I saw no driver install message and both devices were usable within seconds of plugging into the USB socket. Sweet!Update #2:Have used HDMI out to stream Amazon movies to big screen TV and works like a charm. Still missing Netflix and Audio Blue Tooth support which could trigger my return of the unit if not forthcoming. I use a BT transmitter to pair with BT headsets but that is becoming tiresome. I am getting used to Google Docs and, given my limited laptop demands re. word processing and spreadsheet data entry, Google docs is all that is needed when using the Chromebook. The matte screen continues to impress me. Would be hard to take it back but I really depend on Bluetooth audio. I have another 10 days to decide if I am willing to wait and trust Google / Samsung to make it happen.Expiration Date Update:I happily allowed the window for returning my Chromebook expire.  After trying three different Atom based Windows 8 hybrid tablet / laptop machines I settled on an Asus RT and docking keyboard. This geek never expected to purchase and use, much less like, a Windows RT device but stranger things have happened to me. Although I love the Win RT machine, I am almost equally fond of the Chromebook.The size, weight, good battery life,lovely screen, great keyboard and NO FUSS operating system made it a keeper. I am even growing fond of Google docs.  The Asus Windows RT makes for a sweet tablet and I feel as secure using it as I do the Chromebook but it is not the laptop replacement I sought.  As long as my portable demands remain as limited as they are now, the Chromebook makes for an excellent laptop experience.I miss Netflix, Skype, audio Bluetooth and if the price had not been so low and the Asus RT so good at filling in for these missing bits, I would have returned the Chromebook. At $200 - $250 it makes sense ... anything above that would take it a non starter for me.I changed the rating from 2 to 3 stars. Missing too many bits to warrant 4.UPDATE!!!As of March 11, 2013 Netflix is supported! BRAVO! Now for audio Bluetooth and Skype!

Durable plastic, yes, but don't expect a metal casing.The operating system is kinda weird. I'm pretty positive it is android based. It is more formally called \"Chrome OS\" but it's really just a google version of android. If you don't like android, you probably won't like this operating system, so just save up and get a macbook or ipad instead.The touchpad (for the cursor) is pretty annoying sometimes.

I am a student of linguistics, so I need to have PRAAT software on my computer. I also need to have a compiler like Code::Blocks for the electives in computer science I took. I need to have everything backed up multiple times: in the cloud, on the hard-drive, and on an external hard drive, as well.  Can my Samsung Chromebook do all that? Not really.However, the Chromebook is super lightweight, it stays charged for far longer than all my laptops and tablets, it even gives the option of linking this Chromebook to my desktop pc (that is Chrome\u2019s remote access and it is available on the Chromebook already, but you will need to download remote access to your second device in order to connect)! It does have the basics for me: google docs (like word), google slides (like powerpoint), google sheets (like excel) and google photos. It also has shortcuts to youtube, which I have found to be convenient.I use it mainly for writing, reading emails, and combing through the library\u2019s academic journal databases. If I was allowed to install software, I would have more programs running on this than there is right now. As is, I cannot install PRAAT, nor Code::Blocks, which is frustrating. Now, when I need to write code or record audio files, I bring my other Samsung laptop, the Samsung series 7 gamer, orange laptop. I hate doing this. I don\u2019t like taking my gaming laptop outside of the house because it was expensive and it weighs a lot (and has a 17.3 inch screen). So, I have my everyday, minimalist Chromebook with me almost all the time and when I don\u2019t it is because I needed a specific program to run and Chromebook cannot run outside software. This is the Chromebook\u2019s achilles heel, and when I need something not so minimalist, I have to lug around my gaming laptop and leave the Chromebook at home.This works for me, mainly because I already own a collection of electronics and I have back-up computers lying around. If you are strapped for cash, however, and you need your Chromebook to allow programs like SPSS (statistics software) to be installed, I would recommend you look at another computer. I understand that outside software can have security problems, but that is the internet in general at the moment, and the fact that I cannot install software programs is the main reason for the 2 star deduction. I would love to give this Chromebook five stars! Sadly, the issue with the lack of available software programs deserves a 1 star deduction.The other star deduction is because google is attempting to recreate major applications in their own style (i.e. Google sheets versus Microsoft Word and Secure Shell app for Code::Blocks). This counts as a star deduction because I then had to spend a prolonged period of time researching which google app equivalent I needed, hunt it down, add it, and then learn how it works. For example, Code:Blocks is straightforward. Secure Shell (which I used in my introduction to programming class) is structured differently. At first, I spent about an hour reading through internet forums about how to write code in Chromebooks. I finally found Secure Shell, but by that time I was frustrated. I can only imagine what this would be like for someone who does not have backup computers.I guess what I am trying to say is that one must buy a Chromebook already prepared to learn new software applications, because you will. Also, it is a bit puzzling to find downloads. Everything opens up on the web and saves to the web. One has to fiddle with the control panel to save it offline.Here are the reasons for my three stars: superlight weight! Compact! Charge lasts a long time! No need for anti-virus! The Chromebook\u2019s minimalist approach can be seen as a positive for some people! As soon as I lift the lid up, my Chromebook powers up in seconds! Inexpensive! Everything saves to the Cloud! I recommend the Chromebook for anyone who needs something only for essential cloud-based tasks. It also seems like it would make a cheap alternative for students at Universities, especially if their campus is like mine and spends quite a bit of money enticing students to walk in and buy a macbook...To sum up, the Chromebook is a minimalistic computer that works better than great for basic tasks but is below par when it comes to ease of use (because of all the googling I had to do to find the equivalent of Code:Blocks and Audacity) and functionality.One last note, I tried connecting a classroom projector to my Chromebook in order to show a powerpoint presentation, all to no avail. The Chromebook projected only the wallpaper on my screen (a picture of a fox), and completely ignored the google slides presentation that was clearly visible on the computer screen.
