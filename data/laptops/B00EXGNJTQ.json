{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Deal! Spacebar key fix here!", "Author": "harley mclain", "ReviewID": "R21KYHSRZ8B98T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Ok, First off... I have a quick fix for the space bar!Take the small barcode sticker off the sleeve that the machine is packed in, cut it into a few tiny squares and stack them 3 high. Carefully pull the spacebar key off. The keys pop off, be careful though. Now do you see the small, round rubber button? Stick the sticker you made onto the corresponding area underneath where it would contact the space key. Press the key back on and it now works perfectly.The problem is that there is a design flaw in that they left too much space between the key and the rubber sensor under it. I realized this when I noticed no springback after depressing the spacebar. I'm typing this review now and I can type as fast as any laptop, and press anywhere on the key and get a space.Oh yeah, this laptop rules... $249.00 at Best Buy. I love it! So light and thing, sleek looking. Best deal I've seen for the money in a long time.", "Date": "November 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Not bad for an economy laptop.  4hr battery life, hdmi, vga, 2usb 2.0, 1 usb 3.0, 4GB ram, 300GB disc", "Author": "Work In Progress", "ReviewID": "R26X7LZP8R5V23", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice little laptop with a fairly peppy CPU.  This should be an adequate laptop for the average user, with the exception of anyone who would want a CD/DVD drive.  If you only intermittently use DVD's or CD's, you might consider buying an external USB DVD drive (read only drives start at about $25-30).  Omitting the optical drive slims down the unit considerably.  It has 2 USB 2.0 ports and 1 USB 3.0 (useful if you have ultra-fast flash drives for transferring data).  For video output it has 1 hdmi and 1 vga port.  It also comes with an SD card slot (I think this may be a \"universal\" slot for multiple types, but I don't want to say for certain).  As already stated by several people, this has a very mediocre keyboard, especially the spacebar.  Take a look at the fix that user Harley has posted with my comment on how to disassemble/reassemble the spacebar with a shim to fix the problem fairly easily.  If you aren't very mechanical or have problems handling tiny parts, you might want to get someone to do this for you.  Battery life appears to be something around 4 hours or less, which while not great is also not bad either, just average.  There is NO removable battery as far as I can tell, so don't count on swapping out the battery when you run low.  If you are an inveterate road-warrior this might be a consideration.  Other than the Windows 8 (which I don't like much), which is hardly the fault of the machine, everything runs fine.  One last issue.  There is a very large trackpad which tends to be an unintentional palm-reader, i.e. the flat of your hand can sometimes call up commands unintentionally.  While I've seen this issue with other laptops, this one is especially vulnerable to this fault, so don't be too surprised when the screen suddenly changes on you while you're typing.  Just be aware of your hand position and don't rest it on the flat area in front of the keys.  Yes, I know this is annoying, but it's not a game changer.One thing you might want to change right out of the box.  The default setting for Windows Update is \"automatic\".  You should immediately change it to \"...choose updates to install\".  What will happen if you don't is that it starts to download 360MB of updates when it first connects to the internet.  Many people are complaining of \"lock ups\", which in all likelihood is Windows update consuming all the download speed (your browser will take forever to load a page while this is happening).  Your best bet is to wait until you have a reasonably fast connection before manually going to Windows Update and selecting all the updates it is requesting to download.  Then be prepared to walk away and have dinner while it downloads updates (assuming you have a 2MBit/sec connection like I do).  You may have to reboot at least once to complete.  Once you get past this the network performance will rise dramatically and pages will load as normal.  This is a bit of a gotcha if you don't know what's happening.  ASUS should either have the latest updates pre-loaded before they ship, or give a warning so you have a chance to download when it is convenient, rather than starting out with a giant lump-o-data download, which makes their laptop seem like a lemon (when it in fact is quite fast).", "Date": "December 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great for the price", "Author": "Norman Dietsch", "ReviewID": "R1TOP955XQBCTR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I gave the first one I purchased to my daughter, that is, after using it for a few days.  Bought this  one to replace the one given.  It is just what I need for the price.  It lives up to its advertising.  Like Asus.  When I had a glitch in another Asus earlier their service techs were helpful, courteous and prompt on the phone.  When the tech could not walk me through the glitch he advised sending it in under the warranty.  I sent the machine (not this one) to ASUS.  They worked out the fault and now all is great.

I bought an Asus X502C and am using it right now, it is a very good system and has a real advantage in being very thin and light. It seems like an \"ultrabook\" model but in plastic, not metal--but still seems durable. With two core Intel chip and 1.5 GHz speed it keeps up with everything I am trying on it which includes mostly word processing, creating and reading .pdf documents, internet uploads and downloads, YouTube. This is a gorgeous machine for the price and entirely functional for student and home use. Should travel well in a suitable case, I would not suggest banging it around by itself in a backpack. Battery is not changeable, and battery life looks like only a few hours. Note that it doesn't have a CD/DVD drive, those are getting to be rather obsolete for software installs since most software installs are downloads now, but if you plan on watching movies on DVDs be aware that you can't on this system (subscribe to an online video service instead?).", "Date": "December 14, 2013"}, {"Title": "nice laptop", "Author": "kevin", "ReviewID": "R1SEU20FNJTLQD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the laptop works well, and has very good performance, all that I want to the university.... the big screen , the trackpad all of this laptop is good", "Date": "November 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good Deal", "Author": "Danny K", "ReviewID": "R162JZ5HIE1KZO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros:Large 15\" Bright screen, large touch pad, large, Asus instant on turns the laptop on in  seconds.

Honestly, my only two complaints are that the sound kind of acts funny sometimes, as in sometimes when I plug in my headphones, it takes a little bit for it to register the headphones and send the sound through them instead of the computer speakers. My other complaint is that the finish of this laptop allows it to get dirty pretty fast (fingerprints, etc), but that's really it. I'm very happy with this and Asus is a great brand.

I will NEVER, EVER purchase another product from this company--EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I had to return 2 computers within a few weeks due to manufactures defect and to make matters worse, I was told by ASUS representative to return the 2nd computer to Best Buy (where I purchased). Best buy told me they wouldn't send it back to ASUS to be serviced, that it was my responsibility. I was also told by another of ASUS reps that i would be refunded for shipping costs. NOW, I am on hold being told another story (yet again) from ASUS rep. that I will NOT be reimbursed the $20.00 for shipping. This company has THE WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE and exports their calling centers to poorly trained reps. You will be given courteous service but uninformed, inflexible, unhelpful, and simply poor customer service. The product is flimsy and you won't even be getting your 300 dollar worth of product.

Shirley", "ReviewID": "R3CNJLLG8SAPRQ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Earlier this year I bought three ASUS laptops of varying models, one for my office, one for my elderly mother for email and one for my daughter.  We had major hassles with all three. The main problem on each one was activation of Windows.  Two were windows 7 and one windows 8, and on each we eventually ended up working for several hours (over 5) with a level 2 Microsoft Technician to get them to work. As I recall, there was a defective \"security stack\" that would not permit the computer to activate.  Could not load printers, and every boot up was a Groundhog Day with the validation process. My mother eventually returned the one to me because she became frustrated with it; and Microsoft charged me $100 for a tech support call because they said it was \"corrupted\".  So, buyer beware.Other than that, I hate the touch pad.  It is off center to the screen, so if you are accustomed to lining up your hands with the screen, you will always click the right click when you intend to click the left click.  They all had swipe features, which were a MAJOR pain in the behind. I disabled all of them.  Finally, for some reason, the wireless on them is very slow.  I checked online and this appears to be common.  Just slow internet connection. Don't  know what the problem is.I have thrown in the towel on Microsoft.  If Apple ever develops a decent compatible word processing and spreadsheet software, I will dump every PC in my firm and go with Apple.", "Date": "December 5, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00EXGNJTQ"}}
