The case does not hold fingermarks, and is an attractive metallic green.- The screen quality is poor. I have the eyes of a 48-year old, and I can still see the pixels. Despite running through all the colour modes, it is washed out.- Processing is good. The computer stays cool, doesn't make noise and accesses wi-fi as quickly as any other.- The huge problem, which others have endured: the space-bar doesn't work all the way across.- The trackpad works will, and when you press it you can certainly hear it.I don't want to grumble.

The quality is right on the money for the cost.  The screen is bright and easy to read and the keyboard is totally awesome!  Great response time, feel and look, almost the same as my Mac Book Pro but without the backlight feature.  Touchpad is very responsive and right on, works great with double touch slide for scrolling and single touch for clicking.The Pentium powerhouse processor packs plenty of speed and support paired with the 4GB of Ram.  Since my kids don't do any intense gaming I can't say for certain what the true speed shows, but it's great for online gaming and a variety of kids games that we currently use, such as subway surfer, fruit ninja and such.  The only confusing part of the laptop for my kids was Windows 8, but once they figured out how to get to the desktop everything else was simple.Pros of the System:High Quality ScreenFast Pentium ProcessorLight WeightQuality buildFast on the internetGreat DesignLow PriceGood Battery LifeCons of the System:No CD-Rom DriveWindows 8 (Difficult for Some)Asus is a really nice system for the money and it's loaded with features that the whole family can enjoy.

Bauernfeind", "ReviewID": "RHHN0GE968AVB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this computer in October of 2012 at Best Buy because they had a promotion sale on the laptop. I have now owned the computer for 7 months and I feel I can now write a proper review on it because I use it everyday.First off, the Windows 7 software that was already downloaded on this computer is screwed up. My browser is forever freezing as is the picture gallery/editor, skype, and some other stuff. I have uninstalled and then redownloaded ALL of my downloads that are forever freezing and I keep my plug ins updated - still it freezes on me constantly. I asked for advice from my brother in law whom is a computer engineer and he said I would need to completely uninstall windows 7 and then re-install it again. WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP!Last week the letter \"L\" on my keyboard fell of for no reason! I was typing away and BAM it just fell off? I am still able to use the letter but it's a pain in the butt because I can't breeze through when typing for words that need the letter \"L\" - instead I have to bang down on it to get it to work which is super annoying.The speed of this computer is nice though but when it freezes up then everything else does too and I have to restart my computer or it will continue doing so.

However, it functions very reliably, has what I needed it for (bare bones features - I use this as a junker laptop for testing purposes and back-up for my normal system, predominantly).  I love the color though!  And I do have to say that the battery life is superb, as are the functions of the unit itself.  I have not yet gotten used to Win8 (I hate it, actually) but that's not the laptop's fault.*****Update - I originally gave this 5 stars.  I now have it set to a 1.  Here's why.I only used this less than 5 times.  Unfortunately, the times it worked were before my last review.  The next time I booted it up, it blue-screened.  Several reboots got it back up and running, so I was nervous but decided not to sweat it.  The next time I turned it on, it blue-screened again and stated that the computer needed to be repaired.  Nothing brought it back to life.  Then there's ASUS support.  Or maybe they should be called ASUS Non-Support.  They want me to send it back at my own cost, then they maybe will send it back or maybe replace it - or maybe claim that it is something I did (which it most assuredly isn't).  Awful long list of maybes.  I have now lost all respect for the ASUS brand and will never use their products again.  I would highly recommend that any browsing potential buyers do the same.  Yes it is inexpensive, as far as new laptops go, but that doesn't mean you should blow your money on junk.  If ASUS doesn't even stand behind their products, that should be a clear indication of what consumers should expect.", "Date": "April 10, 2013"}, {"Title": "Agile and Full Featured", "Author": "Terry Davidson \"trdavidson\"", "ReviewID": "RADQ38JA11SID", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Mine arrived today.
