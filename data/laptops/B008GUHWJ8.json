After calling Microsoft Support and two days later the agent was able to fix it. Now I am able to stream my movies (which is why I wanted windows 7) and take my surveys and go through my emails without a problem. It's a good little laptop for the money I paid and I have always liked Samsung products. It is light weight and portable with wireless capabilities if I need to take it on the road with me. I love how thin & sleek it is and the built in DVD player for when I watch some movies, but mostly I stream them. It is a refurbished laptop so I got a pretty good price for it too! After Christmas and my wedding last year I couldn't afford a NEW laptop but this one works for me.", "Date": "February 5, 2014"}, {"Title": "good", "Author": "IBUKUN", "ReviewID": "R22TFG16X4IPTJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "got it on amazon to nigeria Through a third party,i really love it and hope to get a deal like this later", "Date": "September 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "EXCLUSIVE FAST START TECHNOLOGY:  Don't be weighed down by wasted time, let your PC come alive when you need it.
