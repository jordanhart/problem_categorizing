{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Chromebooks Go Production", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R1U9O1XT0U6MV0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been testing the prototype Cr-48 since February.  I expected to just use the device for a few weeks and then go back to my desktop system.  But instead I changed a few of my habits and stayed with it ever since.  There is very little difference between the Cr-48 and the production Samsung.  Size is about the same, keyboard almost identical.  Cr-48 was coated with a rubbery material that you either like or hate.  Samsung is more traditional glossy plastic.Both machines have very bright and crisp displays in a wide format.  The screen itself is of the traditional non-glare type.  I can't imagine why anyone would want a screen with glare but I notice many new systems come that way.  I guess if you work in a totally dark room the glossy screens are fine.  The second version of the Chromebook from Acer is said to have a glossy screen for anyone that wants that.I'll second what others said that this machine is not for everyone.  If you a big user of Apple products and happy with their \"roadmap\" to the future, stay with them.  If you need all the specialized software that only runs on Windows, then you'd better stay there too.But... If you are tired of running virus scanners, clean-up utilities, disk defragmenters, firewalls, and tired of having to ask a relative or neighbor to get your machine working again (or worse having to pay someone to do it) then cloud-based computing may be for you.Chrome OS is a slimmed down (very) version of Linux that boots in 8 seconds and awakes from sleep almost instantly.  There is no desktop, so the graphical interface is the Chrome web browser which takes up the whole screen as soon as you log-on to the machine.  There are some \"hidden\" aspects to this OS, but you can only get to them by flipping a special switch for those who like to experiment, and the machine keeps track of the fact that you have done this.  Security experts know that no system is safe if you grant physical access to an attacker, but the Chrome notebook does everything it can to protect your locally stored information (even though there isn't much of that).  Each user must log into the machine and that causes his and only his files to become unencrypted for use.  Signing off causes those files to be encrypted again.  But very little data is stored on the machine anyway and the entire solid state \"disk\" is only 16 gig, so pack-rats need not apply.  The idea is that you store all your documents in the cloud (you are not limited to using Google products to do this of course).  While you *can* download files, typically you do so simply to turn around and upload them somewhere else.  You can display photos and play MP3 and MP4 files locally but that is about it (for now anyway).  In addition to the SSD space you can store local files on a USB stick or memory card (as used in cameras).  Theoretically files you store on the SSD drive will get erased automatically after a while (like a month, though I haven't seen this happen yet).  So if you feel you just HAVE to have some files to carry around with you, a 16G USB stick is probably advisable.If you want to let a friend use the machine, just sign off and they can use \"Guest mode\" and your stuff will be safe, no matter what they do.  Also anything they do will get erased when they are done.  If someone else will be using he machine regularly they can also sign in with a Google ID rather than using Guest mode and their files and yours will be kept isolated from one another.I'm not sure what it is I like about this keyboard as it mostly resembles other \"island keyboards\" but I bang pretty hard on the keys and they usually register without too many mistakes.  I don't feel that I am in danger of breaking the thing as is the case with many new notebooks or keyboards.  The mousepad as others have mentioned is HUGE.  I am not a big fan of mousepads so even with a notebooks I tend to carry a mouse with me.  I recently went visiting needed to use the mousepad for a while though and found it acceptable.  I'd say a cut below the Apple mouspads, but not by much.  Remember that most of what you get from a mousepad is done in software, not hardware.  When the Cr-48s came out there were lots of complaints about the mousepads being almost unusable, but with each new release of the OS things got better and I'm sure that will continue.With Chrome OS being a young product so far there is still room for improvement, but the improvements are coming fairly regularly and they are totally non-disruptive, downloading in the background and automatically activating the next time you boot.  Even that first boot after update doesn't seem to take longer as with some OSs.There are three \"Channels\" for updates: Stable, Beta, and Dev(eloper) depending on how risk averse you are.  There is also a USB stick based recovery procedure should your machine get \"hosed\" which can happen on the developer channel or when playing with the developer switch.Why is there a developers switch?  Well, security is a big goal of Chrome OS.  There are no virus scanners needed, but the OS does do a self-check during those 8 seconds it is booting up, and when your files are decrypted they are check for tampering as well.  The developers switch bypasses some of this paranoia, and also gives you access to additional parts of the file system that are normally off-limits.  In addition you are given access to a more complete set of Linux/Unix commands some of which could get you into trouble.  People have run other version of Linux, Windows and even the Apple OS on Chromebooks by flipping the developer switch, but then that is rather missing the point of a machine that is designed specifically for cloud-based computing.  On the other hand, if you have been keeping your stuff in the cloud, and happen to trash your system while on the road, getting it going again doesn't take too long or involve too many steps (and I suspect might eventually only entail pressing a reset button or something).Finally, on communications, WiFi set-up is as easy or easier than Windows or Apple machines I've used.  Previous connections are memorized by default.  All the protocols up to and including \"n\" \"just work\".  In a pinch you can tap into the 100M of free Verizon wireless 3G coverage.  In a real pinch they have various for-pay coverage after that.  I've tried it just long enough to know that it works.  On a trip I can imagine tapping into the \"unlimited\" plan for a day at a time between WiFi enabled hotels.Cons: (1) I wouldn't have minded a wired Internet option as well, but with notebooks getting thinner and thinner it would probably be hard to squeeze the connector in there.  So far the \"n\" version of WiFi maxes out my router's speed anyway.  (2) Only VGA connectivity to external monitors... else I might be tempted to use this as a desktop machine with a larger monitor.  If there is indeed a Samsung \"mini\" desktop system waiting in the wings that will probably be a better way to go anyway (and might well be significantly cheaper than a laptop). (3) There is a way to go for \"apps\" for this ecosystem.  there are advanced applications that demonstrate what *can* be done such as music composition, technical drawings, photo editing (and of course Google Docs which handles normal office needs) but almost everyone will run into situations that require a \"legacy\" system to handle.  For example, you currently have to use a special set-up on a Windows or Apple machine to print, unless you have one of the very new \"e-printers\" that have an e-mail address associated with them and support their own network connection.  If the Google \"roadmap\" holds steady I fully expect these issue to be addressed in the not too distant future.In the mean time, I'm sitting comfortably here on my couch with my Chromebook, and not tempted to sit at the desk where I have a \"more powerful\" system.  Come to think of it, I have more power in the cloud than I could ever afford at home.  With proper interfaces, everything I could need.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing product!", "Author": "M G", "ReviewID": "R2A2S1JFYOWHHF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very happy with my Samsung Chromebook. I had been looking for a computer that was fast, easy to use and did not keep breaking down so when Google announced the Chromebook Pilot program I signed up and got the CR-48. I really liked my CR-48 and therefore bought the Samsung Chromebook with 3G at the Gilt flash sale. I've had it now for a few days and am very happy with it.The Samsung Chromebook is very light weight and portable; and I like its clean looks and solid finish. The keyboard is amazing and the trackpad is HUGE. It also feels a lot faster than the CR-48. The software on the CR-48 kept improving and getting better in the 6 months I had it and it feels like its gotten even better on the Samsung Series 5. There's now a file manager and a media player and it is super easy to upload photos to Picasa. And ofcourse it has Chrome which is fast.The setup was ridiculously simple. As soon as I logged in all my apps, bookmarks and settings came in and it felt like I was back on my old computer. In all I think I went from closed box to fully ready in a couple of minutes. This was truly amazing. All the other benefits of the CR-48: the fast boot, quick resume and built in 3G are all there in this Chromebook.I would recommend a Chromebook to anyone; but when people ask me if this is right for them this is what I say: it's great if you primarily use a laptop/ notebook for your personal stuff which, at least for me, is almost all web-based - gmail, facebook, amazon, youtube, google docs. For 'work' I use design software (Adobe CS5, Autocad, etc) that needs serious processing power and a large screen; and thus I use a high-end laptop, but that means it's  heavy and cumbersome. The Chromebook is my personal computer and it works perfectly for that purpose - we leave it lying around the house and pick it up whenever we need to do something that is not work related. It also helps that its battery life is phenomenal. When my parents (NOT tech-savvy) were over they also used the CR-48 a lot and it worked great for them. I plan to get a new Chromebook for them too. So if you want a notebook for personal use that works fast, is reliable and inexpensive, get this one.", "Date": "June 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Samsung Chromebook: First Impressions", "Author": "Chipp Walters", "ReviewID": "RZ24R2X0VVZWD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "**UPDATE**I've removed a star from the previous 5 stars because I had to recently send my Chromebook back to Samsung when the battery quit working. It absolutely refused to take a charge. I suspect the battery is not the problem, but either a software or hardware glitch is responsible, and the Chromebook forum's recommended action to remove the battery can't work as this battery is embedded in this model.I hope this isn't symptomatic of a poor design standard from Samsung. I used to really like Samsung, but I've been having more and more problems with their products as of late. My father's three year old $3K+ 54-inch plasma screen went out and we ended up replacing it with a new Sharp LCD-- which cost much less than fixing the Samsung. Let's hope Samsung gets their product quality back up to where it once was.FWIW, I still very much enjoy using it and believe the concept to be excellent!--------------------------------------------------------------Recently, I purchased this Samsung Series 5 Arctic White 3G Model Chromebook. For those of you who don't know, Chromebook is a notebook computer which runs Google's Chrome OS and is for the most part just a Chrome browser in a notebook. I know, it sounds rather simple and not very exciting. But, knowing how much I depend on Google for business and after doing a bit of research, I became interested enough in it to purchase one and try it out. Here's what I now think of it after using it for three days.Early impressions are extremely positive. It has many of the features I really like of the iPad while also retaining much of the functionality I like in netbooks. I should mention, I run a virtual company and we pretty much run on Google Apps, including accessing email in Gmail, creating and editing documentation in Google Docs, and with most spreadsheet work done using Google Spreadsheet. We aso like Google Presentations as a collaborative tool for creating slide presentations. We use many online tools, including Basecamp, Freshbooks, Quicken Online, Dropbox, FogBugz among others. So, it's fair to say, we do a whole lot of computing already 'in the cloud.'The implementation of the Chrome browser is great. It looks and behaves exactly the same on Windows and MacOS, which was a bit of a surprise to me seeing how it's based on a Linux kernel. When I first logged in, the Chrome browser already had all my bookmarks and personal preferences setup as I had on my other Chrome installs (PC and Mac), which was a nice surprise. In fact, install should have been a snap, but a forced ChromeOS update hung a couple times, forcing me to hard restart, but it finally hooked up. I'm not sure, it may be an issue with my bandwidth, ISP, or even the Google Chrome update servers seeing I got mine as fast as possible, along with, I'm sure, MANY MANY others.The Samsung Chromebook is a bit larger than netbook computers, but smaller than most notebooks. The keyboard is easy to use. It's fairly light for a notebook but still weighs twice the iPad2. The Chromebook display is much higher resolution at 1280 x 800  vs the iPad's 1024 x 768 and the Chromebook has a whopping 2GB of memory versus the iPad2's wimpy 512MB (iPad 1 is only 256MB). Both iPad and Chromebook use solid state drives, with the iPad having three configurations to choose from: 16GB, 32GB and 64GB. This Chromebook only has 16GB, but does have an SSD slot along with a couple of USB ports where you can add more memory. Because the Chromebook focusses on connecting to the Internet and storage in the cloud, I don't see lack of local storage as a significant detractor.Chromebooks can be purchased from $349 to $499 (this one), the topend being a bit more expensive than one might expect. I think this price may come down as more of them are sold, still they are quite competitive when priced against current tablet models including iPad.The PositivesExtremely long battery life. No kidding. Reportedly it can run continuously for 8 hours. I've not had to recharge any more than once per day-- just like my cell phone and iPad. I also have Sony Vaio and MacBook Air laptops, and neither get even close to iPad or Chromebook in battery life.Instant on. And instant connection to wireless. My Chromebook takes 8 seconds to boot-- from a cold start. Closing the lid puts it to sleep and it resumes from sleep instantaneously, much like my AirBook. But unlike my AirBook and more like the iPad, the wireless connection seems to be instantly connected. I've set mine to force a password login from sleep mode, something I would encourage anyone to do who owns a Chromebook or iPad.3G so I can connect anywhere. Combined with extreme battery life, this is one of the most valuable features of this particular model. Furthermore, Verizon gives away free 100MB of transfer per month for the first two years of ownership. I used to think having a wifi hotspot was just as good, and I do have one of those as well, but my good friend convinced me otherwise after seeing him pull out his 3G iPad, check his email and put it away in 30 seconds. The darn wifi hotspot takes over two minutes just to boot, not to mention having to connect it to a laptop, iPad or iPhone. As such, I'd never use it to quickly check an email or Google an address.No auto-correction, it's replaced by good spellchecking. I find when I send emails on the iPad, I have to constantly check to see what iOS has automatically corrected and changed. I know I can turn it off, but sometimes it does come in handy, just not always. It's SO MUCH EASIER TO TYPE emails on a Chromebook than on an iPad-- and this is one of the reasons folks like my business partner, an extreme typist, may prefer a Chromebook over iPad as an Everday Portable Computing Device (EPCD).Large trackpad with MacOS type functionality. I do admit, I mostly prefer Apple's implementation of trackpads. Two-finger scrolling and a physical click directly on the trackpad help make it easy to use. Still, dragging and dropping is somewhat difficult, just like on my MacBook Air, which IMO is better done with two fingers on opposite hands. The feel of the trackpad is very smooth and works as well as on Mac devices.Keyboard modifications make it actually easier to use. There's no caps lock key, which surprisingly to me, is not missed at all-- in fact, it's better because I don't accidently hit it when typing. It is replaced by a search key which opens a new browser tab and highlights the URL field. If you really want CAPS LOCK back, you can choose to do so in Chromebook settings. Also, the mostly useless function keys on other keyboards are replaced by much more useful keys like: forward, backward, refresh, full screen, show next window, brightness and audio volume buttons. Much better.Printing is easy to setup and just works. I was able to easily setup my Epson wired and HP wireless printers to work with the wireless Google Cloud Printing. I was a bit concerned this would be an issue, but it turns out it just worked-- not as seamlessly as Apple's AirPrint, but easy nonetheless.Multi-user accounts make this a family computer. As I mentioned before, I'm all setup on Google Apps, and so is my wife and daughter. Because I don't need to worry about viruses on the Chromebook, or any files getting damaged or lost as they're stored in the cloud, I can easily lend my Chromebook to my wife and daughter for them to use. They each use their existing Gmail account sign on and then they're good to go. So, if my wife goes out of town, she can take the Chromebook with her to check emails, bank balances, etc. and it's more secure because of the 3G access (We all know those wireless access points are not always very trustworthy!).Lost or damaged Chromebooks aren't as expensive as one might first imagine. The first thing I think about after spilling Red Bull on my notebook keyboard and watching the screen fritz is \"what data have I lost?\" -- and this is the real expense of a lost, stolen or broken laptop. When all the data is stored in the cloud, that question pretty much goes away. Furthermore, the Chromebook is not as expensive as my MacBook Air or Vaio, so if something does happen to it, no data is lost and it's less expensive to replace with a new one which is up and running in no time at all. This is huge, and one reason I'd like to talk my Dad into using one, as sometimes he forgets which file he left on which computer or he downloads new Windows apps which 'promise' to speed up his computer, but instead install viruses, which I later have to remove.Economic model is great for small businesses. You can 'rent' a Chromebook for between $20-30 per month for employees, and Google will take over all help desk responsibilities. This is huge, and IMO, a real gamechanger. The business administrators can configure all employees Chromebooks from one central interface. And, if your Chromebook breaks it is immediately replaced free of cost. This is huge for small businesses who can now spend less on IT and more on productivity-- assuming you have no need for standard business apps like MS Office, which many, like us, have given up in favor of Google Apps. For those diehards who absolutely need to run MS Office, there are several HTML5 remote desktop computing solutions which allow Chromebooks to run remote virtual instances of Windows7 running Office and other Windows apps, but it seems counterproductive to the ease-of-use premise of Chromebook.Chromebook runs Flash with no problems-- along with several other web application frameworks. There are many web applications which try to replace desktop applications using Flash and Flex.For instance, Aviary.com has a bunch of really cool apps including their Phoenix image editor which mirrors much of what Photoshop can do-- and they all run in a browser using Flash. I've had no problems using these products including HTML5 apps which allow me to FTP into WordPress sites, and even edit directly the php and CSS files directly. Certainly, there are many more on the way. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for either iPad or Android.The NegativesA few keyboard issues. There is no delete key. There is a backspace key. For Mac users, this is probably no big problem as the Mac doesn't have one either. But for many of us Windows users the delete key is critical to our workflow. Hope this is fixed in newer versions. But Mac users will be disappointed with the undo,cut, copy and paste keyboard shortcuts. There is no Apple command key so you have to use the CTRL key as a modifier, which is quite a finger stretch for those trained on the easy Command-Z,X,C and V workflow.There is no Netflix. Yet. For those of you hooked on Netflix, it's rumored to be in the works, but currently there is no way to play Netflix. I suspect this is because the OS is based on Linux and for some reason, Netflix has some specific requirements which only run on MacOS and Windows and iOS.There are many applications which have no online counterparts. No decent 3D apps are available as web apps. And of course neither support for the real Photoshop and MS Office or my favorite programming language, LiveCode. We all have our 'gotta have' applications, and many of mine are just not available.No GoToMeeting or Skype. For me, these both are two of the biggest detractors right now for Chromebook. I depend on both these apps during the day, and both are supported on the iPad. Though, frankly, GTM on iPad is pretty bad-- you can't initiate a meeting nor can you do any sort of screen sharing. Google Voice does work on the Chromebook. While there are plenty of rumors, there's no word yet on when or if there will be an HTML5 or Flash version of Skype. There are some pretty decent chat clients. One isNo Network, No work. This is a common complaint for most reviewers of Chromebook. But, for me, it's not such a big deal. I only want to use my Chromebook when I need web access, so I purchased it with 3G built in. So, unless I'm flying somewhere, or way out in the country, web access shouldn't be much a problem-- and if I can't have Internet access, I doubt there's much I really want to do. Also, I don't think of my Chromebook as my only machine, only as possibly the one I may end up using the most.Final thoughtsFirst of all, I hope others see the value in owning a Google Chromebook. Because as more users buy them, more companies will have to take note and begin support for them.As products and operating systems become more and more complex, the simplicity of accessing and storing data on the cloud using only a browser is appealing to those who crave for a simpler and easier way to do things. This is an important step in lessening our collective dependency on older and more antiquated OS'es, which are providing less and less value to us as they become more and more complicated. Fact is, modern OS'es have been looking like the same animals, doing the same things, offering the same features. Apple's new OS named Lion now has many similar features as Windows 7, including the much needed ability to resize a window from any edge. But also, looking forward, Lion also adds some very interesting iOS features, such as implementation of fullscreen mode which does away with windows-- and acts more like a fullscreen BROWSER-- just like Chromebook already does! I expect if ChromeOS is successful, it will start to implement Android type features much like Lion has adopted iOS capabilities.I personally think Chromebook is excellent family based computer as well as perfect for many small businesses. And for myself, someone who owns a desktop PC, Mac and Windows laptop, and iPad, the Chromebook will be an interesting fit. It will be telling to see how much time I spend using it-- my guess is it will take over much of the space my iPad used to use. I enjoy the iPad because of it's instant on, super long battery life, and super fast and capable connectivity to the web-- all things make it a superb Everday Portable Computing Device. The Samsung Chromebook has all of this PLUS I can now view Flash, type emails without looking at the keys (instead of hunt-and-peck on iPad), and have an overall better browsing experience. We'll see.", "Date": "June 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good First Try", "Author": "Chris Macias", "ReviewID": "R16QL4MBQRM04A", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Pros:Battery Life- this outshines my Sony machine. With the sony I can last about 2.5-3 hours. on this machine I can get over eight hours, a huge plus!Cloud- it is very nice to have work synced up with my main Sony machine. This is of course if you are comfortable using Google's web applications. I would make sure not to utilize the cloud for any sensitive information.Boot-Up- almost instantaneous! Definitely nice to not have to wait on a desktop to load upCons:Keyboard layout- Some minor quips about  button placement. The top row of function keys have been replaced with web-centric keys, I never use them! I having been using Alt + Arrow keys to navigate and Ctrl + R to reload  on my Sony I still do this. There is no delete button, instead the power button takes up the position where the delete key resides on my Sony. I have to consciously adjust my typing since all i have to work with is a backspace button. The Caps Lock key has been replaced by a dedicated search key, I hardly used the Caps Lock key, so I have tendency to not use the search key as much as the designers had intended. Other notable missing keys that I had used often are: home, end, page up, and page down.Mousepad- I have been using both a Sony Laptop and Macbook Pro, both with multi-touch functionality. It is disappointing to to not see similar execution built into the over-sized touch pad.  Right clicking is a little awkward using two fingers to get the right click menu. However, Drag and Drop is made painful  by placing one finger down and using the other to drag the item around the screen, while keeping the other  one still in its place. Not very well executed, and can be uncomfortable.Data- 100MB for one month! Ridiculous with the amount of content on a single page, I would be surprised if you didn't hit the ceiling by the end of one week let alone a couple days. I checked my facebook page, logged into gmail, and updated my tweetdeck app, in a matter of 15-20 minutes i had used up 12MB of the 100MB allowance. The pricing on the data options are very unreasonable. 5G of data for one month will set you back fifty dollars! Of course this is the same treatment that smartphone users have to endure, an unfortunate consequence of an oligopoly .Google Music Beta- having been an early adopter of the chromebook, I would have thought that Google Music would be pre-installed or at least a definite  invite.Removable Media-  I tried plugging in my Western Digital 1 TB external to test out the file manager, that I had read about. After about 3 minutes of waiting, I gave up and unplugged the device. It was taking way to long to try to read the files.Lack of Apps- The Chrome Market has many apps, but very few great apps, while this is most likely due to the infancy of this platform, I find the lack of options a little diappointing.Notes:  The computer was designed with the sole purpose of consuming content on the Internet. It does not disappoint in this arena. However, I can not recommend the device as a laptop replacement, or content generator.  It is very convenient for traveling, being light weight and able to connect to either 3G or nearby wireless networks with ease. I would say this would be a suitable substitute for  smart phone web browsing allowing you to save battery life on your precious iOS or Android device.  I am satisfied with my purchase, and believe it is a good first attempt.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Soaring in the clouds !", "Author": "Gary Lai", "ReviewID": "R3QHOTDMR5CGR9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For people willing to evolve to cloud computing and with access to good WiFi or 3G most of the time, this is a great product. It is not going to totally replace a Windows or Mac computer for most people, but I find I can do 95% of my daily computing much faster and easier with my Chromebook. Before I bought it, I was ready to replace my 4-year old Windows laptop which is running like molasses now, and was not looking forward to spending days setting up a new Windows machine between migrating over all my files, uninstalling all the bloatware, setting up the antivirus and firewalls, installing all my programs, etc.. But now, with my Chromebook (which took less than 5 minutes to set up out of the box), I don't have to replace my old Windows laptop at all. I can just keep it in a drawer and pull it out for the two times a month I need to use it. If my Windows laptop ever totally dies I can replace it with a used or low-end cheap Windows laptop since my primary computer is now my Chromebook. This is saving me money and lots of time in the long run, and it's the reason why you would want a Chromebook and a Windows/Mac laptop at the same time.Now onto a review of the Chromebook itself - battery life is really 8 hours with normal use, as advertised, and it really does cold-boot in 8 seconds and resume from sleep in 1 second. Once you get used to this, everything else will seem like a throwback from the stone age. The screen is very bright and nice and the keyboard is a breeze to type on. Instead of  the cryptic F1 through F12 buttons you'll see on top of a Windows laptop keyboard, you have browser navigation buttons like Back, Forward, Refresh, Full Screen, which is very convenient. The trackpad takes some getting used to because it has multi-touch features and has no buttons (you physically press on the keyboard with one finger until it clicks for left click, or with two fingers for right click), but after a few days, I was proficient with it. It works fine with a mouse too. It feels super light and thin to carry. Many of the software issues reported in earlier reviews have now been fixed by Chrome OS updates which comes out automatically every 6 weeks. I haven't experienced even a single crash of the browser in 2 weeks of daily use. The build quality is very good in my opinion. In terms of web page loading performance, it's pretty fast - much faster than a comparably priced laptop. Hulu and other flash-based video is a bit jerky at 720, but if you turn it down to 480 it gets much better. Streaming video on Netflix works great, no jerkiness at all. Rhapsody/Napster and Amazon Cloud Player works great for listening to music, and of course, so does Google Music Beta.All the reviews that say you should just get a Windows netbook for the same price and run Chrome browser on it instead to get the same experience just don't get the whole Chromebook concept. Not only will you not get instant-on and 8 hours battery life out of a Windows netbook, but you'll have to deal with all the required maintenance of Windows. You can get a new Ultrabook or Macbook Air now for 2-3 times the price of a Chromebook that gives you (almost) instant-on and 8 hours battery life, but it'll still be running Windows or Mac OS with its endless time consuming updates, the background churning of the anti-virus/malware protection software, the battle with the bloatware. Despite all this maintenance, your Windows machine will just get slower and slower as time goes on, and if you lose it or damage it, you're going to be back to square one setting up a new machine.  On the other hand, a Chromebook requires zero maintenance, and over time it just gets faster and faster with OS updates that refresh the image. If you were to lose or accidentally destroy your Chromebook tomorrow, you can get a new one, turn it on, and literally be back exactly where you were in less than one minute. If you log onto a friend's Chromebook, it will be as if you're using your own since with your Google account login it will sync all your bookmarks, themes, and apps automatically no matter what machine you're using. This is revolutionary.Now, since most criticisms about a Chromebook revolve around what people think it cannot do, let me debunk some myths:- Printing: Yes, it can print. Google has a service called Google Cloud Print that works with web connected printers sold by HP, Epson, and Kodak. Basically you send the document directly over the web to your printer. Getting one of these printers will allow you to print directly from the Chromebook or a smartphone or a tablet (Android or Apple iOS). If you don't have one of these printers, you can still print from your Chromebook by sending the print job to a Windows or Mac machine instead, which will print it to any printer it is connected to.- Microsoft Office documents: Yes, you can work with Microsoft Office documents. Google Docs, a fully functional web-based word processing/spreadsheet/presentation productivity suite, can open Microsoft Word and Excel documents by converting them into Google Docs format, and then can save them back in Word or Excel format after you are finished editing if you want to. Also, Microsoft offers a free version of Office Web Apps and a free 25 GB cloud storage Skydrive account, which allows you access to versions of Word, Excel, and Powerpoint through the web browser.- Local Files: Yes, you can download files from the web onto your Chromebook. It has 16 GB storage and also has an SD card reader. So for example you can pop your SD card out of your camera onto your Chromebook and look at the pictures or upload them to Picasa or whatever cloud storage you use. You can connect to USB thumb drives or USB hard drives and manage the files on those. You can download an MS Word document to your Chromebook and upload them to Google Docs or Microsoft Office Skydrive for editing and sharing. It's a little more cumbersome to work with local files than on Windows, but it does work.- ZIP files: Yes, it opens Zip files with the latest version of the OS.- Working offline: Contrary to what is stated in many reviews, a Chromebook is not a brick when offline. You can read Gmail and compose new messages which sync when back online. You can view (but not edit) your Google Calendar and Google Docs documents, although Google is reportedly working on bringing offline editing back to Google Docs. In the meantime, there are free apps like Scratchpad which allow you to do light word processing offline and sync with Google Docs when back online. The media player can play MP3s and MP4 video files from local storage or an SD card. Lots of games work fine offline. You can read your Kindle books offline with the Kindle Cloud Reader. I'm sure there are many more apps on the Chrome Web Store that work offline I haven't discovered. In short, if you're on an airplane flight and there is no WiFi, your Chromebook can still keep you plenty occupied.And here's what a Chromebook cannot (at least I haven't figured out a way) that will cause you to dig out a Windows or Mac computer:- Java/Silverlight: No, the Chromebook currently does not support websites that require Java or Silverlight. However, it does support Javascript, which is what you're more likely to run into on a daily basis. Most people will not miss lack of Java or Silverlight support.- CD/DVD drives: Chrome OS currently does not support external CD or DVD drives. But seriously, CDs and DVDs will be going the way of 8-track tapes and vinyl in a few years.- Scanner: Chrome OS does not support use of scanners yet.- Bluetooth -  I think the Samsung Series 5 and Acer AC700 actually have Bluetooth radios, but the Chrome OS doesn't support it yet. It's supposedly coming soon.- Desktop applications: You can't install programs on the Chromebook. The locked down operating system is one of the key benefits of the OS (it provides the security against malware and makes the OS simple and light), but also it's primary drawback. Since you can't install any programs on the Chromebook, desktop applications like Microsoft Office, Skype, or video editing tools will not work. There are existing web applications that can replace many of these things and many more are coming out every day, but if you find that you simply cannot live without desktop applications and must use them all the time, then a Chromebook is not for you.Now, the question of a Chromebook vs. a tablet comes up in many reviews. I personally own a tablet (Asus Transformer) as well, that I'm very happy with, but I use it to consume media and do some light web surfing, or my kids use it to play games. When I want to be productive and create content, I use my Chromebook as it is much better for that. I even spent some time using my Asus Transformer with the snap-on keyboard dock, and trust me the Chromebook is much more functional for productivity. A tablet wants to be a tablet and not some kludgy tablet/netbook combo, since the main benefit of a tablet is its portability and form factor.If you are thinking about buying a Chromebook, I recommend that you spend a couple of weeks seeing if you can do nearly everything you want on a Windows or Mac laptop using just the Chrome browser and no desktop applications. When you want to write documents or spreadsheets, use Google Docs, Microsoft Office Web Apps, Evernote Web, or equivalent. Use Gmail or other webmail program rather than Outlook. Use Picasa or Flickr or equivalent for your storing and editing images instead of keeping them on your hard drive. Stream music rather than playing MP3s from your hard drive. Use Google Talk instead of Skype. If you find yourself completely paranoid about where your data is being stored and whether or not you can get to it in case of calamity, then a Chromebook is not for you (conspiracy theorists are not the target market). If you find yourself constantly exiting the browser to open up a desktop application, then the Chromebook is not for you. But otherwise, I think you'll find that the world has evolved to a state where this is not only possible but easy and liberating to live on the web, and the Chromebook is a great vehicle for navigating this new world. Thin clients are the cutting edge of the future (maybe a bit too early for many people).Final thoughts - some things I hope Google/Samsung/Acer improve for future hardware / software releases:- Bluetooth support- Offline Google Docs editing - right now Google Docs are available for viewing offline and there are workarounds for offline editing like Scratchpad, but full offline editing and sync capability with  Google Docs would fix all these issues.- Just a little faster: The only noticeable performance issue is jerkiness when playing flash video at high bit rate. This should be fixed.- Price: I think the optimal price point is $50 less than current MSRP, making the Acer AC700 Wifi model $299, the Samsung Series 5 WiFi about $379, and the highest end model Samsung Series 5 with WiFi+3G about $450. Google and the OEMs should not try to cheapen it anymore than that, but rather they should play up the value for that price point. I bought my Samsung Series 5 Chromebook used on eBay for much less than MSRP, and I think I probably be less enthusiastic about it if I paid top dollar.A Skype web app would be nice too since even though Google Talk/Hangouts is just as good, not as many people use those services, but since Skype is now in Microsoft's hands I am not holding my breath.", "Date": "October 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Solid Laptop, Almost There", "Author": "Mike", "ReviewID": "R72UOK46KFLSO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "First off, this laptop is definitely not for everyone. The Chromebook will appeal most to the minimalist-loving, cloud based consumer. If you love a very swift boot time, mainly use your web browser, and trust the cloud then a Chromebook is the perfect choice.Design:The Samsung Series 5 has a sleek design and even comes with a cool chrome icon. Despite having a plastic feel, the laptop is well worth the $500 in terms of hardware. It weighs 3.3 lbs so its not too heavy, but also not the lightest laptop.Chrome OS:Chrome is Chrome OS. If you use chrome as a browser then you already know how this OS looks and performs. One plus to the Chrome OS though is that there are no application bars on the bottom of your screen and the media player, downloads, and various web apps minimize and disappear when you move away from them. This gives the OS a clean, clutter-less feel. Where the Chromebook really shines is its boot time. The Samsung Series 5 automatically starts up when you open the lid and within seconds, takes you to the login screen. At times, it feels less than 8 seconds.Web Apps:I haven't used too many web apps but most of them are bookmarks. I think in order for Chrome OS to be commercially successful, the web apps need to become of better quality. Since I rarely use web apps and almost never use programs like photoshop or dreamweaver, this is not an issue for me, but for users that require more from the web will frown upon this.Performance:The Samsung Series 5 performs how any dual-core atom processor would. Websites run fine, youtube videos at 360-480p run fairly smoothly (full-screen might have a different performance), and hulu runs at an average quality. Even having 5-6 tabs open won't hinder the performance of the laptop so it's quite capable. The keyboard is comfortable and has many useful shortcut keys. The trackpad is good, but does not compare to the mac trackpad. It does not support too many multi-touch gestures and scrolling is not as definitive as the macs.Overall:The Chromebook is capable of all casual browsing tasks such as social networking, watching online videos, listening to music, and basic document creation. In terms of performance I would have given the laptop 3-3.5 stars because the Chromebook does not do anything out of the ordinary and the price is not amazing. Yet I decided to give it 4 stars because of the rolling updates. Since Google constantly updates the Chromebook, with time, the computer is bound to get better. If you believe in Google's vision of the web and that they will fully back Chrome OS in the future, order a Chromebook now, but if you want a traditional laptop with all the standard features, stick with a similar priced pc or a macbook.", "Date": "June 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Simple and elegant internet access point", "Author": "Saul Goode", "ReviewID": "R197FNXYDDD9Y3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Pros: Instant on, 9 hour battery life, requires absolutely no maintenance, nice hardware, multiple user supportCons: Is only a web browser, limited offline-capable HTML5 apps currentlyI really like my Chromebook.

I basically needed something small and efficient for writing emails while on the go.  I have an iPad, but that doesn't fit the bill.  Tablets are great for consuming content, but not for generating it.  I've found that I almost exclusively use my tablet while sitting on the couch or while lying in bed at home.  For travel, I need a laptop.  I think that's funny, since tablets are supposed to be super mobile and ending the reign of the PC.Anyway, here's a brief list of pros and cons:PROS:- Perfect size- Lightweight- Simple and clean design- Battery lasts foreverrrr.  24 hours+ after opening and I'm still on the initial charge.  18% remaining.  It's the first notebook I've had that I can walk away from and forget about while it's on and unplugged without constantly thinking about how I shouldn't do that and I need to go plug it in.- It barely generates heat and makes *no* noise (my previous laptops were all 17\" beasts which did a lot of both)- Chrome OS is fun to play with and easy to useCONS:- Like Apple's laptops, the track pad is so large that I often hit it with my palm while typing.  Though the roominess of it is nice, that part is slightly annoying- The screen is nice and bright, but the contrast is weak, so light colors can be hard to see.  Chrome OS's text selection background color is very light, so often it's hard to tell what you're selecting- I would have loved to see a back-lit keyboard.  I think they missed an opportunity here to set that as a standard feature on Chromebooks.- There is no \"delete\" key!!!- I wish I could drag a tab from one window to another.  If it's possible, I haven't figured it out yet.- It's not a very fast machine.  It's good for light to medium work, but nothing heavy.- Tabs seem to get stuck while loading or crash after loading more often than they do in Chrome on Windows.  This is not to say that it happens often - it just happens *more* often than Chrome on Windows.- I wish there was a way to tab through panels like I can tab through tabs- Google's cloud services are all separate and dispersed.  (Picasa, Music Beta, Google Docs, etc.)  When I want to save a photo, it'd be nice if Google had their own unified cloud file system I could save it to if I wanted.  Like Dropbox or something.  I'd pay for that.  Right now I have to save the picture to the machine's HDD, then upload it to Picasa.  It'd be nice to not have to ever hit the local storage.  I know Google intends to make it so that you can add other internet services as cloud file systems that you can save to, but one branded as Google's would feel safer/more natural/better integrated.SUMMARY:I'm pretty satisfied with this little device.  It does exactly what I wanted it to, and I enjoy being part of the initial set of users on products, especially if it's something Googley.  The software I expect will be enhanced over time, and whatever issues remain outside of that are outweighed for me by the fun and sense of convenience that I get from playing with this thing.  I imagine though that it's not yet for everyone.  If you spend a good amount of your time offline, or using things other than a web browser, or don't want to be annoyed by the roughness around the edges of a new OS, you should probably stick with a PC or Mac for now, and maybe take another look this way in 6 months to a year.

I run my life on Google, multiple GMail accounts, Calendar, Sync for my mobile phones, Chrome syncs all my computers bookmarks etc., I've been a Google Voice user since it was Grand Central and Google Music beta actually let me sync my over 500GB music collection to their servers.As for the hardware, I've tried every tablet, (I currently have a GalaxyTab, an iPad, and a Playbook) but for the same reason I prefer my BlackBerry Bold over my iPhone is I need a keyboard, and the keyboard on the Chromebook is pretty good.

Read This Before Deciding ...", "Author": "Consumer Advocate", "ReviewID": "R2W4CDEWUPU8UQ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Having spent some time comparing the Samsung and Acer, I found the Acer much better in the following areas:1. The Acer has removable battery that doesn't require you to disassemble your computer. There are 3, 6, and 9-cell capacity batteries to choose from. A fully charged one can be swapped in in seconds, just like ordinary notebook computers. The Samsung has a sealed battery inside (see ifixit.com) that cannot be replaced by anyone but Samsung. I cannot find a replacement battery for it on Ebay.2. The 2 Gb RAM in the Acer is removable, whereas the memory in the Samsung is SOLDERED in. In the event that it fails, you'd need to take it to Samsung for repair. You can imagine how much it will cost (parts + labor + shipping cost) compared to replacing the RAM yourself, not to mention lost time waiting. Because of this, ifixit only rated this Samsung's repairability at 6 out of 10.3. The Acer has a much better webcam at 1.3 Megapixels. Acer puts this excellent webcam, which it calls Crystal Eye, in almost all of its notebooks. It has excellent resolution and color fidelity. Samsung just says it has a 1 megapixel webcam and there is no further information that can be found.4. The Acer has HDMI output so your Chromebook can be connected to a large screen TV for viewing. The HDMI interface carries both audio and video signals in digital format. The Samsung just has an analog VGA connector, which is for video only! You need to run another cable for audio. Give me a break! I cannot understand why Samsung would put in this archaic interface on an advanced notebook like this in 2011!5. The Acer has a better a display at 1366 X 768 resolution (true 16:9 aspect ratio), compared to Samsung's 1280 X 800.In addition, you can read all the reviews on the Internet and watch YouTube videos comparing the two. Most agree that the Acer is superior and at a lower price ($299 for Wi-Fi, or $399 for Wi-Fi + 3G). Nonetheless, very few pointed out the fact about the Samsung's non-user-serviceable battery and memory, or the superiority of Acer's HDMI connector over the Samsung's VGA connector.Update:For the technically inclined, you can get something very similar to the Chromebook by running the Chrome OS on a USB stick with your PC or Mac. Just search for \"chrome os lime\" on Google. It requires downloading the Chrome OS image and burning it onto the USB drive using an image writer. It's not difficult. The boot time is about 15 seconds and the entire computer runs really fast, not as good as a Chromebook, but pretty close, and it's free! You should also know that Chrome OS Lime is updated DAILY and its compatibility is very computer brand and model specific. Even with BIOS that has \"boot from USB\" capability, computers older than two or three years probably can't run. If you have Compaq CQ62-423NR, I can tell you that Lime works (sound, touchpad, Adobe Flash, Wi-Fi, webcam, etc.).If you want to easily track your interests on the Internet on a daily basis, I'd suggest yourversion.com. It will track each keyword that you specify, for example, \"chrome os\", and it will present the latest info about it in a list of websites. It's more convenient than Google search.

I have read reviews on here saying that people do not like it since it does not have a dvd/cdrom or because it is not like a laptop. I just want to say to those people, DUH! This Chromebook is strictly for going on the internet. If you like listening to cds or watching dvds on a laptop type of computer, then this is NOT the item for you. If you want to go on the internet, do research, or chat online, then this is the item for you.It is simple, sleek, lightweight, and something that you can easily toss into your bag for travel. I have the Wifi version, and I absolutely love it. I can use it at home, or I can go to the coffee shop around the corner and connect there without having to worry about someone stealing my info or having to worry about getting a virus from using an open Wifi connection.The keyboard is comfortable, and I haven't even noticed that the CAPS key has been replaced by a search key. If you want or need CAPS, then just hold down the shift key, its that simple. The mousepad is large, comfortable, and very easy to use. It is very sensitive, and the lightest touch will have the curson/arrow moving on the screen. It moves with the pad of your finger, or even with your knuckle.For those who like to play games on the internet, like pogo.com, there is a bit of a problem and that is that the Chromebook does not support Java, and I dont know if it ever will. That is the only downfall I have had with the Chromebook.I use this for hours while sitting in bed, or sitting on the couch and it is amazing how cool is stays. I had a laptop and it got so hot on my legs I couldnt stand it. Even sitting with a pillow on my lap, the heat from the laptop would go through the pillow and still bother my legs. So this Chromebook is wonderfully built, it gets a tiny bit warm, but nothing that is uncomfortable, and this is over the period of hours.The battery life is amazing, I only have to charge it every other day, if that often. Depending on how much I use it, it is absolutely amazing! I don't know how they did it, but this battery is what people wish for on their laptops. 8+ hours in a single charge? Its amazing!Now, for the speed of things on the Chromebook, I have been using my Chromebook for about 2 weeks now and it does searches fast, pages open faster than they do on my Dell desktop, and I think that is because there is no virus software that slows down this type of computer. On a desktop there are so many different programs running in the background that NEED to be running in the background, and it really messes up the speed of things. On any Chromebook there is no need for virus software, or any of that other junk, and it makes a world of difference.The start up time is also as fast as they say. Each time I turn it on, I time it, and its always 8 seconds, how cool is that?!?!Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who likes something that is portable, lightweight, and easily connects to the internet. If you do not need a big computer or a heavy laptop, then this would be the option for you. If you have kids heading off to college and you don't want them to have an expensive computer/laptop that someone might steal or they might lose, then this would be the perfect option for them. And if it does gets lost, all their info is stored online, not on the hard drive. Older people can connect to the internet with no problem, and this is also good for people who like lounging around their house. Do you ever want to be on the internet, but not stuck behind the desktop all day? Or want to enjoy the beautiful weather outside, but need to get some work done on the internet?

Additionally, one of the best perks offered is that since it's all on the cloud, you're less likely to lose work and the computer itself is less susceptible to viruses with its own system of handling malware.While the Chromebook may seem a horrible choice for those who require heavy-load applications like Microsoft Office and perhaps games and so on, if you need a quickly accessible tool for on-the-go work, the Chromebook is a nice option.", "Date": "November 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Chromebook Shines as a Cutting-Edge Road Warrior and Leanback Laptop", "Author": "John J. Blossom \"John Blossom\"", "ReviewID": "R3FYRJLY04VPXT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you're looking at a Chromebook seriously for purchasing, chances are you're a person who uses the Web for almost all of their computing needs already. You surf it, you listen to it, you watch videos on it, you chat on it, you probably read and write your email on it, you may even write and store your documents on it and keep your business' books on it. In other words, if you're wondering what it is that you really need a PC or Mac laptop for besides the Web, Chromebook's answer is, \"Good question.\" The Samsung Chromebook runs Google's brand-new Chrome OS operating system, which is an ultra-fast and light operating system that delivers everything that the Chrome browser does, plus just enough beyond that to get you connected to the wireless Web, your USB and SD card storage devices and, if you're so inclined, an external VGA monitor and USB keyboard and mouse. And that's it.Whoa, so, you mean, we're really not going to be able to use software from our PCs? Yep, that's the deal - though many of your favorite programs already have versions available in \"the cloud\" of Internet sites that provide software that works in your Web browser and stores your files in \"the cloud\" of computers chugging along in well-run data centers where they do things like backups regularly and take care of the equipment well. Compare that to the typical laptop users' experience with crashes that leave files in never-never land and you can see why many people are eager to leave the heavy lifting of computing to the pros out there on the Web.What you get for leaving the world of PCs and Macs behind is a computer that has little of the baggage associated with them, which means that the relatively light Chromebook can run lean, fast and efficiently where PCs and Macs would struggle. Configuring a Chromebook is ultra-simple; take it out of the box, turn it on, log in with a Google account (or make one for free), set up a connection to your wireless network or to the optional Verizon 3G wireless plan, and you're done. After that, when you turn it on it will take all of 8 seconds to get a login prompt and just a couple of seconds after that to get to being productive on the Web. Forever. That's right, instead of having a super-fast PC day one that turns to mush as soon as you start loading - and breaking - software and files, Chrome OS stays fresh as a daisy every day, getting automatic updates to its relatively small footprint on your machine. Should you lose or break your Chromebook and have to get a new one or borrow someone else's, no sweat - your new machine running Chrome OS will be just like your old one in seconds. That's a huge plus, also meaning that the ease of migration to newer units will keep hardware vendors competing to give you faster, better and cheaper units, since there aren't files or installed software to keep you invested in the hardware running Chrome OS.So what is this cloud machine like to use? The Samsung Series 5 Chromebook is a great machine physically. At 3.3 pounds, it's a light laptop, certainly heavier than today's tablet/pad computers but having the advantage of hands-free viewing and reading. I like tablets, but I don't think that you give up much of their convenience with a Chromebook, while getting the efficiency and productivity of a full-size keyboard and Web browser. Battery life is superb, enabling up to 8.5 hours of use in typical conditions. While it's not quite as heavy-duty as some popular high-end laptops, it has a really solid feel in spite of being a very light unit. The 12.1-inch display is very bright, providing a very crisp and readable display even in bright direct sunlight. The oversize touchpad is very nice, making it easy to use it from almost any hand angle. There is a built-in mike and a built in 1MB webcam also can take snapshots. There is a place to plug in a combo mike/headphone headset, so you can slide over your earbuds from your phone easily. You get two USB ports, one behind a cover which also protects a mini-VGA port, a very compact power supply for charging and plugged-in use, and another covered bay that conceals a SIM card for your carrier's optional 3G service. Also included in the box is a short cable that provides a standard VGA connector for the mini-VGA port, so that you can plug in a monitor or computer projector easily. No, not an HDMI port, though I understand the Acer unit will have one. A \"developers mode\" switch lets you get at the guts of the unit if you're so inclined to tweak it or to install a different operating system.Okay, so you've logged in to your Chromebook. What's it like to use it? Well, if you've used Google's Chrome web browser for PCs, Macs and other machines, then you're already doing pretty much everything that you can do on a Chromebook. Except for some icons in the upper right corner of the display  for time, network connection bars and battery life, what you see is the Web via Chrome. Unlike other Web  browsers, Chrome was built for this moment from its first debut. Each browser tab that you open is in effect a separate, secure program with no ability to mess up your disk or your other tabs. If something crashes in one browser tab, it won't affect content or software in other tabs. On a PC, this means that you have a browser that won't mess with your PC and runs very efficiently. Without a PC's baggage, it means that you have pretty much the safest and fastest way to create and consume Web content.Chrome provides easy access to \"Web applications,\" software that runs in a Web browser. For example, Google Docs, a Web site that enables you to create and store Web documents, is software that runs on any browser, including Chrome. For Chrome, key Google Web apps like Docs are being tweaked to enable their use when you're not connected to the Internet, and the latest version of Web standards for programming browser apps - HTML 5 - enables anyone to do likewise and many have made offline-capable Web apps already. One of the things that we can expect to see as the result of Chrome OS are more Web apps that take advantage of this capability. In the meantime, by default every newly opened browser tab in Chrome provides access to the Chrome Web Store, a Web site that makes it easy to find the thousands of Web apps that can make using a Chromebook a pleasant and productive experience.Popular Web apps in the Chrome Web Store include the Angry Birds game, which works very smoothly, Google Docs, the Evernote document creator, Aviary photo editing and specially designed versions of Sports Illustrated and The New York Times. Most of these are free apps, though some may require payment to access premium content and features. There are also many, many Web apps and highly functional or entertaining Web sites that aren't in the Chrome Web store that will work just fine in Chrome. This is, after all, the Web itself, with the Chrome Web Store playing the role of Web app showcasing. You can even use Microsoft's free Office Web Apps app to create and edit documents in a Web version of Word, Excel or Powerpoint.A Chromebook performs quite well, considering that its guts are based on an Intel Atom N570 dual core processor, a very good CPU but not a high-end unit. The Chromebook comes with 2GB of memory and 16GB of storage, which can be used to tuck away files downloaded from the Web or from your own media. In general this configuration works very well in everyday use. Since all Chrome OS does is run Chrome and a few simple hardware devices inside the Chromebook, most of its memory and processing power gets focused on the browser. What this means is that most browsing experiences are about the same as you'd expect to experience in a much more powerful laptop. Videos tend to chug a little bit at times, although an optional setting that makes use of the Chromebook's graphics processor more efficiently tends to make them run more smoothly. You can have lots and lots of tabs open in Chrome before you'll see any noticeable performance lag in most instances.The good news on performance is that we're in the very early days of high-power Web apps, with both Google and others working hard to improve their performance. New capabilities being readied for Chrome such as Native Client processing will enable more complex Web programs and graphics to run much more quickly. Chrome OS itself is being tweaked constantly, so that eight-second login is likely to get better, not worse, as time goes on. In the meantime, the relatively light processor driving Chrome OS on the Chromebook enables low power consumption with little heat, meaning super-long battery life and very little heat. The unit's cooling fan is very quiet and pushes out a whisper of heat, as opposed to the hairdryer-like blast coming out of many laptops.For those who have files that they want to use or to upload while using the Chromebook, the SD card bay and USB ports offer you the ability to take them with you. Using files on a Chromebook is not an ideal experience yet. When you pop in a USB drive or SD card, you get a pretty simple file manager interface, which can provide thumbnail previews of graphics files. There's a fairly limited range of file types that you can open and use on a Chromebook, since it relies on Web-based software, though most file types can be uploaded to services on the Web that can open then for use. A built-in media player can show photos or videos and play tunes, but it's not much to look at and the features are minimal. A nice plus for the file manager, though, is simplified uploading of photos and videos to the Picasaweb image sharing site. You can slide in your camera's SD card, choose or create a Picasaweb folder, and push them up to the Web quickly for private or public viewing.All of Chrome OS' pop-up windows appear as panes docked to the bottom of the browser display, unlike the PC version of Chrome, which allows for pop-up windows to appear and move anywhere on the display and even to move tabs in Chrome to new windows. This is kind of annoying at times, since it's less flexible, but for many functions it turns out to be quite practical. For example, if a Web site opened up a popup window of text or a form, you can minimize it to the bottom of the display and then pull it up quickly without having to wonder where it is.The other major \"oh, that's different\" aspect of the Chromebook is the keyboard and touchpad. Most of the keys on the Chromebook keyboard look the same, but you'll see many that just aren't there and some that are different. For example, instead of a Caps Lock key you'll see a Search key (you can set it to be Caps Lock instead if you want). There's no Delete key, though you can press Alt-Backspace to get the same effect. The top row of function keys have browser-specific functions mostly, plus keys for display brightness and sound control. Once you get used to how to use the Ctrl and Alt keys to get some of the typical extra keystrokes on a standard keyboard, it's basically the same as any other. For that tradeoff in total keys you get full-size keys that are easier to stroke on a very comfortable keyboard. That's something that most notebook computers of this size just cannot claim. If you plug in a standard keyboard, the Chromebook will adopt to its layout, though some of the PC-oriented function keys won't work.Probably the least developed feature on the Chromebook is its webcam. It works well enough for services like Gtalk and other Web-based video chat services, and you can use it to record YouTube videos, but that's about it. The camera itself is pretty decent, though, so probably the software available for it will make it more useful soon enough. Other minuses include a battery that cannot be removed without opening up the unit and non-upgradeable memory - you're stuck with 2GB, decent enough as that is. But for a unit at this price point, those aren't unusual compromises. The optional Verizon 3G mobile data plan for U.S. purchasers includes 100MB of data a month for two years. You can barely blow your nose on the Web with 100MB these days, but as a backup to wifi or a mobile phone equipped with a wifi hotspot, it's very cheap signal coverage insurance. Apparently you can slip in data SIM cards for other mobile carrier networks, but I haven't tried this yet.Missing from the unit altogether is support for Bluetooth devices. I don't consider that a hardship, especially since it's typically an extra drain on battery life, but some might consider that a minus. With the rise of Wi-Fi Direct communications, which work pretty much like Bluetooth but use standard wifi communications with virtually no setup hassle, I think that we'll be seeing less of Bluetooth devices in the future. Still in the wings is access to files on Android mobile devices, which connect to the Chromebook via a USB cable but don't yet allow file access.You can print pages and documents on the Chromebook via Google's Cloud Print service. When this is set up,you can sent print jobs to a printer connected to a PC set up for Cloud Printing services. Cloud Print can send print jobs directly to printers that use the ePrint wifi printing communications standard, but so far only a handful of HP printers set up for ePrint work with Cloud Print. I tried Cloud Print from my Chromebook through my PC's printer and it worked fine, though given the balky nature of router and wifi printer connections, I wouldn't bet my life on it working from afar.There are also versions of the Chromebook available to academic institutions and businesses at monthly service pricing, which includes an administrative console software package. Presumably the console feature will allow a not particularly techie central administrator to enable or disable features and logins remotely for their Chromebook users. Institutions may also be interested in PC desktop software emulators being readied for Chrome OS, giving you the ability to use PC software remotely via a Chrome browser window.The bottom line is that if you're using the Web for virtually everything already, have regular contact with good wifi and wireless data connections and you're looking to leave PCs behind (or never wanted one in the first place), a Chromebook may be right for you. You may think that you'll use it as a backup device, relying on your PC or Mac to do your everyday \"heavy lifting.\" And if you're using heavy duty software like professional video and photo editors, high-power document layouts and fonts or gotta-have-the-software services like Skype, then that may be the case. But if my own experience and the experience of other early Chrome OS adapters is any guide, you'll be finding every excuse you can to make your Chromebook your \"plan A\" machine. Its fast startup, near-zero virus hassles, ease of use, light form factor, amazing battery life and ease of use make it a real pleasure to use for all but the most software-heavy applications. Key offline apps for productivity are coming soon, as are better device interfaces, and Chrome OS in general is forcing Web apps to get better. Chromebooks are ready for a Web that's getting better and more powerful by the day. Best of all, Chromebooks are pretty future-proof. As the Chrome OS software gets better and as Web software gets better, its performance will get better, without a stitch or work or investment on your side. And when that inevitable moment comes when it's time to get the next shiny new Chrome-equipped machine, all you'll have to do to get there is to log in to it; say goodbye to all of the new-machine headaches that were part of the PC world.Is it a bit of a walk on the wild side to use a Chromebook? Yeah, sure. This is a machine with a brand-new operating system, after all, not to mention a whole new way of looking at how computers and the Web can work together. But in truth most of us are ahead of the PC and Mac world already. We're already on the Web almost all the time, using software reluctantly or out of necessity. So in a sense using a Chromebook is telling the computer world to get with the program and to support the Web the way that it was meant to be supported. But in the meantime, what you get is the Web, nothing but the Web (plus some files, if you must), anywhere, any time, the way that it was meant to be. My guess is that you'll be plenty happy almost all of the time with just that.", "Date": "June 24, 2011"}, {"Title": "Avoid the Chromebook! - 6 month's experience and I totally regret my purchase.", "Author": "ozob", "ReviewID": "R3D4CRWUEPBMUY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you think tech support is frustrating with Windows, wait until you deal with Samsung, HP (for the cloud printer) and Google.The concept is great but this is NOT ready for the public.

Do you complain that an wireless tablet doesn't have an ethernet port? Of course not.Comparison:After switching to Apple products a few years ago, my standard of quality and ease of use changed greatly. This is no MacBook Pro/Air or even an iPad but it does have flash which was my wife's biggest complaint with our iPad/iPhones. At first the low framerate of flash video was horrible and it made watching videos choppy and unwatchable.

I have my music on amazon cloud, I have all my pics on picasa and everything else on google docs. I have 80 gigs of storage on google for $20/year. sweet price let me tell you... and the thing is I can listen buy music from amazon cloud and keep it in the cloud or download it to my chromebook or evo or home computer. but I don't bother. if I'm driving or flying I can download what I want onto the chromebook or evo for when I don't have access to the web. it works great. not perfect, but I recently travelled from seattle to california and back again (with my cr48) and I had music all the time in the car, even when I was on 101 and had no internet connection. and when not driving I was always able to use the restaurant wifi or my evo hotspot and surf the web on my chromebook while enjoying my meal. it was great.the series 5 is an elegant looking machine. I love the white front and the google chrome logo. the actual logo is 3d and looks great. the keys are well space and very easy to use. true to most samsung products everything is feels plastic to me. the body is fine. it feels solid in my hands, it's lightweight and fits in my large purse no problem. the keys are nice too, but I wish the trackpad felt like it did on the cr48 which had a nice slightly rubbery feel.the atom dual core processor is nice and fast with the chrome OS. everything loads quickly and easy and surfing the web is snappy and fun.from the moment I turned it on for the first time and to when I was ready to surf the web was about 2 minutes. since I had sync turned on in my cr-48 and on my chrome browser, once I was through the opening setup everything from my other computer and laptop was already there. my themes my bookmarks and all my apps. that was really sweet. I did have to reenter my wifi password and activate the verizon 3g anew, but even the verizon activation was very quick and easy and took about 3 minutes. they do ask for a credit card but the don't charge anything to it if you only sign up for the 100mg free, which I did since already have the unlimited data through my sprint evo 4g. and if I am in a 4g area the data is just almost as fast as my home wifi. sprint 3g is sometimes very good and sometimes very slow... I think time of day has a strong effect on that but much less so for 4g connections.on the start page I have all the apps I need, google docs, calendar, you tube, amazon cloud player, which opens in a panel so the music can be accessed easily no matter which tab I am on. I also have gtalk , picasa, google music beta, huffington post, ny times and npr as well as a couple games like solitaire, mahjongg and angry birds. as well as the chrome web store. for other chat programs I have a pinned tab for imo.im which works great for facebook, skype, and msn.if you use or have used the chrome browser on your mac or pc, you know how to use the chromebook. they are very much the same with the addition of a wrench to access your setup and the few additions to make this an OS instead of just a browser.I use the chromebook for close to 90% of my computer needs. I recently won a free ipad2 on phonedog.com which is a nice little device but has the most annoying list of things that don't work on an ipad and I find myself grabbing the chromebook when I go out for the day instead of the ipad.the only real downside to the chromebook for me personally is a) netflix doesn't work yet... it's supposed to be up and running by midsummer. we will see. and b) at this point very few things work offline. the very basic media player if you've downloaded a few songs or a movie  have an sd card with you. a few games like angry birds and that's about it. google docs and calender and email are supposed to be offline by midsummer as well. let's hope this is true!but honestly the times when I've been somewhere I didn't have some kind of a signal have been few and far between and I spend a fair amount of time in very rural in western washington, on the rez and on the san juan islands. and for all practical purposes my cell phone and ipad were just as useless.so yes I am one of a handful of chromebook guru's for google and chromebook central on the google groups. but I can safely say if you want to be portable and have a long battery life, and most of your daily computer is on the web, then this is a solid viable alternative and I highly recommend it.  I haven't used a honeycomb tablet or a webos tablet but for me this is a much more powerful alternative to an ipad or a netbook. especially with the nice size screen. have fun!!", "Date": "June 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "This is a son's review for his fathers Chromebook.", "Author": "Jacob S. \"Suade907\"", "ReviewID": "RS2CZ4TK8YEPY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Ok, so here goes. I'm 40 years old this year and it seems my Father never fails to realize that I have my own family, responsibilities and problems. But being a good son I try to help him whenever I can. But when it comes to PC's he's the king of breaking them. He get's viruses, spyware, has software problems, you name it he's done it. I'd say I average a complete windows install every 6 months to a year and then I have to deal with the software backups and god it's just a mess and a massive waste of my time.So long story short I read about chromebooks a few years ago and i liked the concept. For a person like my father I thought it would be great. So time went by and my father right on his yearly schedule wipes out his laptop. So this time i talked to him about the chromebook concept. He likes google and has a android phone, so I sent him a unbiased review. He told me let's give it a try. So we settled on the Samsung Chromebook series 5. It came in 2 days and bam he was up and running. So far he really likes it. It has great battery life, a good screen, it's very easy to use. And none of the fluff that gets him into trouble. The only gripe I have is that at times on some videos it can be glitchy. For youtube and netflix there is no problem but I'd have to guess some flash video has issues not being smooth. This is the only reason I give this laptop a 4. I'm sure it's related to it's atom cpu not being up to snuff for flash. But other than that the laptop is speedy quick and he's very happy. The one feature he misses from his pc is autocad. I was able to setup remote desktop through the Chromebook and now he can access his pc in the other room. It's functional but not ideal. The resolution looks squished a little on the Chromebook but he said he can get by and hopefully they will update it with a fix or something in the future.The only issue he has had thus far was he had the charger plugged into a outlet that was hooked to a light switch and it was off. He drained the battery and we thought the Chromebook was defective. It ended up he had no power to the charger and just had to flick the light switch. That took about a hour to figure out after going online troubleshooting almost setting up a RMA and then just checking it for the heck of it.Long story short. I think I'll be happier than him because if this one ever breaks he just has to buy a new one to get his stuff. I hope google doesn't abandon this platform.

However if you spend most of your time writing word docs, excel sheets, email, blogging, facebook, twitter, google+, youtube, movies, searching online, accessing SSH terminals (CTRL+ALT+T) or offering remote desktop support over logmein, this is the absolute best device you could ever get!It boots FAST and the battery lasts forever. It's light, thin and great to take with you wherever you go. Being able to use 3G data is an absolue treat in those situations you're away from wifi. If you're not on Verizon Wireless, simply press CTRL+ALT+T and change the assosication by entering \"modem_set_carrier Generic UMTS\" (without the quotes). Then reboot and insert your SIM from your cellphone.Switching between multiple windows with multiple tabs is great (or as I consder, \"workspaces\"). One window for personal email and personal things, another for work related, multiple ssh terminals open.. I have zero compalints about this device.There are many advanced features and keyboard shortcuts which aren't well documented.Caps Lock = Press both shift keys at the same time to toggleHome =  Ctrl+Alt+up arrowEnd = Ctrl+Alt+down arrowPage up = Alt+up arrowPage down = Alt+down arrowDelete = Alt+backspaceConnecting to ssh terminals:Ctrl+Alt+Tsshuser username (enter your user name here)host 123.123.123.123 (enter your host name/ip here)connectCan also handle other typical ssh options which is great.Highly recommend this for people constantly on the go in need of a thin/light device with exception battery.

Performance has been acceptable except when Microsoft security updates and Norton antivirus scans are being performed in the background.

So I have been wanting to get off Microsoft OS for some time because they are the 800 lb gorilla and as such, the hackers have placed the big red bulls eye target on them.I have evaluated apple ipad and Android (Honeycomb) operating systems as an alternative.  But they are intended for tablets, which are great, but the touch screen just isn't for me.  I am much faster with a keyboard/mouse combination.I have also been watching the development of Chromebook and down loaded the Chrome browser to check out the concept. I am familiar with Linux and have felt for a long time that it is a good stripped down alternative to bloated windows (give me windows 95 any day).  Well the other day, Microsoft was downloading nine security updates into my computer at the same time that Norton was doing a virus scan (I have tried living without an antivirus software and these security updates and I won't make that mistake again).  My laptop was unusable for over 45 minutes and I thought this was ridiculous.  I ordered the Samsung Chromebook with 3G and I have no regrets.  I don't care that there are some things that are more convoluted to do, that I must keep my existing laptop setup with my scanner and printer, and that often I must find workarounds or learn new things to get things done.  None of that matters to me one bit because the benefit of being able to check e-mail, bank accounts, see how the market is doing etc, and do this virtually instantaneously is priceless to me.  I have absolutely no regrets.  If you can afford it and believe that your time is precious, buy one of these Chromebooks.  The concept is sound and they will only get better with time.

Now, to be fair, she had a \"cheap\" laptop - a $700 Lenovo that gave us all that it promised to, but was simply a pain to actually use.Anyway, fast forward to today - 6 months in to having her Chromebook - and she loves it.  Is it perfect?  No, but close to it for the way she uses it.  It could be a little faster at times, but it is lightyears ahead of her Lenovo, even on the day we bought it.  For half the price, her Chromebook gives her twice the experience.The best parts for her are: boots in seconds, wakes from sleep almost instantly and she doesn't need to worry about spam, malware or anything else.  When she has 15 minutes to use it, she is USING it, not waiting for it to be ready to use.The best parts for me are: nearly zero \"IT\" support and a wife that actually checks her email.  With Windows, I was constantly having to intervene when things went wrong.  She has used a computer for years, so it wasn't \"user error\" or things like that.  Its just all the crud that comes with running a Windows machine.  On average, she needed help one out of three sessions with Windows and it isn't like that with the Chromebook - I can think of one time in 6 months that she needed help, and that was that our cable modem needed a reboot.

It is clearly the go-to device around our house.  We have an HP laptop, Asus netbook, Dell desktop, Xoom tablet, and Kindle Fire.  Although the tablets are nice for consuming content, a keyboard often makes life easier.We wanted something portable, with a keyboard, for internet use.  Most laptops, including ours, give you two or three hours of battery life before you have to tether yourself to an outlet. Not ideal. Plus the fourteen or fifteen inch screens make laptops a little bulky.  We wanted something with long battery life, that turned on instantly, and was light but with a reasonably sized screen of twelve or thirteen inches.I was skeptical of the Chromebook because I saw so many poor reviews, but I kept coming back to it.  Macbook Airs are nice, but expensive.  There are some nice Windows based ultrabooks around, but (a) they too are pricey, and (b) I am SO tired of Windows updates and issues....  Not to mention I had a hard time considering buying a Windows 7 computer when Windows 8 is right around the corner.  The Chromebook sounded better and better, and didn't require anti-virus software - another headache I could do without.  When the price of the Samsung Wifi Chromebook dropped, I had to give it at a try.I use gmail already, and Chrome as my browser, so when the Chromebook arrived all I had to do was wait for it to update (maybe five or ten minutes) and sign in.  Shazam!  Off to the web...and it was nice.  No, it doesn't have an optical drive, and yes, there are things you cannot do with it.  And the speakers are mediocre at best.  But for surfing the net for hours on end, it is wonderful.  It was sometimes sluggish the first few months, but I looked at it as a price I was willing to pay for a computer that wakes instantly and has about eight hours of battery life.  Every six weeks or so the Chrome OS is updated, though, and it has been running very well the last couple of months.  As promised, I think the OS updates are making it a better product.For our use, the Chromebook has been great.

Can be serious for some light coding, or if you are a blogger or writer - fantastic device.Light, quick, actually has a battery life.You can quickly get used to everything being \"web app\" and not having a \"file system\"...However I know that at some point a few things will be an issue1) as downloads become plentiful, managing them and finding will be problem2) being limited to a tab interface becomes almost tiresome. Multitasking isn't as intuitive... but that could be a plus because you can just focus on getting one task done. The tab becomes cumbersome because page titles aren't always the most helpful so once you have 20 tabs open... and multiple windows, you need a road map.Biggest complaintThe finger pad. Some really cool possibilities like two fingers scroll the page up and down. Nice touch.. however the finger pad is rigid and follows different standards. Clicking and dragging isn't as simple as my other laptops or a mouse.The fingerpad doesn't seem responsive BUT nor does the computer overall. You need to remind yourself your on web pages.It would be nice if the \"apps\" could indeed run outside of a tab window. So they can feel more like apps instead of windows.Interesting thought, we've been making computers feel more like browsers and now that there is one that does that, you realize it would be nicer if I can minimize, scroll and have little modal windows/apps running instead of running them in just a main chrome browser window.Another drawback is you go app/sign in crazy. Suddenly, to many apps, to many logins and you get lost.I also found interesting that my 7 and 8 year olds as most kids are, just pick up a device and use it. Kindle fire, droid phones, motorola tablets - we have them all in the house.. kids never even ask me to do something or how can I. They find apps, install them, play them or remove them.I was excited to let the boys try the Samsunc Chrome book and some of the games on there.. they both walked away after 15 minutes use. I plugged in a little usb mouse ( which they HATE using the mouse ) and it improved it a little... but I was really excited to try some games like google Input/Output but my one that loves games like that got frustrated after a few hang ups, the game not working, sluggish response and refreshing the page.HOWEVER POSITIIVESI want it for me... I can do with out the games but found same frustrations above.. and I am a power user, and a web developer... so not a novice.But in the Chrome defense, I wanted to connect to a webpage, make some html changes and move on. I quickly found a great app. Completed tasks and moved on.I am an avid writer working on several projects which I store in google docs.FANTASTIC. And for it's compact design, the keyboard is nicely spaced. I was typing at normal speeds within minutes.DESIGN OF PRODUCT - externalslim, sleek, proud to carry it, nice and simple. No frills.Feels a little cheap in a way but its aesthetic is nice.. and the \"cheap\" isn't so bad.. first - it is. Price point is fantastic.. and it boots up as promised.. so I know the weight of it is intentional. It almost doesn't even feel like there is a battery in it.I would buy another, probably a nicer model to see if it boasts anything more. Would be great for homework and kids, not so much for gaming.And I hope the app designers start adopting wider standards for logins and such. Some apps were just annoying to login.. and I don't want to share every game I play on facebook so don't force me to.Great for new product, has a lot of work.. for the dollar amount, it would be tough to be dissapointed.", "Date": "April 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great portable netbook for the enthusiast", "Author": "wlmeng11", "ReviewID": "R1YCHQVUSO5Q8G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is probably not for the average user (WTF this doesn't run Windows or OS X?!?!).I would still consider this to be in late beta, as the operating system is still being actively developed and improved.If you want something that has already been perfected and is ready for the average user, this is NOT for you.If you want to try something new before you neighbor does and don't mind minor frustrations or setbacks, this IS for you.Hardware wise, this is meh.

Sure, you could compile your own version of Chromium OS or use one of Hexxeh's builds, or maybe use Jolicloud, but those aren't the commercially-backed Chrome OS.Chrome OS is far from perfect, but it receives updates frequently, which are applied after an 8 second reboot. No more waiting half and hour for Service Pack 1. I have already seen miles of improvement on Chrome OS since I started using it last June. Can't say that about most other operating systems.The built in 3G is a nice addition, but Verizon's plans are ludicrous for the Chromebook (in fact, laptops and tablets in general, even phones now for newcomers). You can't buy an unlimited plan. That is a killer, considering that this is a netbook.

While it's not perfect, I am so glad I did.  I use my chromebook as my primary computer now, and use my old windows machine solely to download a back-up copy of any music I buy through Amazon.The things that make it great:1. Start time-it's pretty instantaneous. From sleep, it only takes about 1-2 seconds, and most of that time is used to reconnect to the wifi.  If I have trouble (Netflix is still a little buggy sometimes), I can do a cold restart in about 10-15 seconds.2. Battery life-if I used it for internet browsing, facebook, and music streaming, it lasts about 4.5 hours. Watching video brings it down to 3.5-4 hours.3. The screen is amazing. Very vivid and sharp.4. The keyboard is very comfortable, and has most every key I need and nothing I don't.  I use the search key about as often as I use caps lock, which is almost never.5. The operating system itself.  It's so simple, and now with the new major upgrade, a lot sleeker too.  I just wish they kept the battery meter somewhere always in view when you're in full screen.  It doesn't warn you when it's about to die, so you have to check every so often.  The operations probably wouldn't be so great if google didn't offer such amazing products to go with it.  I recently uploaded all my music to google music and don't need any hard drive space for it.  Google music could use a slightly better interface, but it's manageable.6. Multiple users-when friends come to visit, instead of signing me out of everything to check their email/facebook, they can simply sign on as a guest.  It's especially useful for me because I type in dvorak, and none of my friends do, so we don't have the \"argh, what is this keyboard doing?!\" conversations, and I don't have to keep signing into my accounts.7. Set-up-it's so easy, so simple, and there's non of that annoying bloatware that's keeps asking you to buy its license.The not so great:1. The speakers are TERRIBLE.  They're tinny, fuzzy, and not loud enough at all.  When I watch video or what to listen to music, I have to plug the chromebook into a stereo.2. It did not come with a little dongly thing to convert micro vga to regular vga.  Would have been nice to have one, especially since pretty much everyone who uses a computer to watch tv shows already has a regular vga.  It's inconvenient to buy a new adapter, but definitely not a deal breaker.3. Apps.  I'd like to make this my 100% of the time computer and throw my old windows out my actual window, but I can't because I can't get programs like audacity and skype. Skype I can use through my phone, but it's nicer on a notebook, and there might be an audacity-like app to record, but is there one that can record streaming radio? Not sure, because it's not that easy to find out. Sometimes streaming sites can be really buggy (see Netflix), but I expect those problems will go away with more upgrades.Even with the downsides, it's still a great computer, and way better than any machine I've used in the past.

You have no apps for Nook or Kindle, even though my android smartphone does. This is true for many other popular items.3. Apps in general are minimal, and many fail to work as advertised. Many load, but then fail to run.4. File manipulations are difficult, and many obvious programs that run on Linux do not run on ChromeOS. That is simply a fact. Open office won't run, and so you are left only with Google Docs, not bad if you can live with it, but clearly limited.5. Google Docs is not robust enough to handle large or complex documents or spreadsheets. They are working on this, and Google will get there, but if you need this feature now, you are out of luck.

I have a blackberry with a keyboard, and two laptops with nice keyboards (think easy to type on naturally). And now this Google tablet-like thing with a keyboard. This keyboard on the Chromebook is really nice. Well spaced keys and soft short strokes make it very easy to type long messages. Which is done with great difficulty on the popular tablets' touchscreens. It reminds me most of the Macbook keyboards. You can try out a Chromebook by using only Google Chrome and the apps from the app store on your computer and nothing else. It's basically like that only a LOT faster than your computer because the browser IS the operating system. The Chromebook was extremely easy to set up. I took it out of the box, turned it on, signed in to my wifi, and google account, and that was it. Surfing the internet in less than 30 seconds from when I got it out of the box. Keep in mind that this will not replace you computer, but it's better than a lot of those tablets (I've played with all my friends different ones and was only impressed by the Kindle Fire).Pros: FAST, lightweight, great screen, memory cards and usb thumb drives work as they should. It's cool running and doesn't seem to get even warm. It has a fan which I can only hear if I stick the vent in my ear. Battery life is EXCELLENT - 7+ hours for me (I got 10 once with the screen dimmed almost to off). Lightning fast suspend and resume two seconds maybe. You have access to at least 12GB of ssd storage locally and whatever you shove in the sd slot and usb port easily with the built in file browser. Yes NETFLIX WORKS even though this is a Linux-based product. It prints using google cloud print. It does everything you need very efficiently if you're plugged into the google docs and cloud storage already. It's hackable without doing permanent damage or voiding your warranty.Cons: Not able to browse my local network shares (this would make it a computer replacement for me if it did). It isn't that it didn't work, it's just not a feature. The sound is not awesome. It's as good as most of your tablets, but not on par with a laptop. It's not loud enough. You could watch a movie in bed, but you can't listen to music with kids running around the house unless you plug it into your sound system. Lastly, it does not like not having a wifi connection - this is not a problem for me as this will mostly be used at home and hotels with free wifi.I have really enjoyed this system and look forward to the advancements Google will continue to make with it. Some people who have been severely dissatisfied with the product and gave it poor reviews all seemed to be expecting a full blown laptop. They also seem as though they attacked it for not being Windows and didn't really review the product. I've been able to give good reviews of a product that I didn't necessarily like, but that wasn't the products fault. Go at this with the mind set that you want a tablet (with their limitations) that can do more faster and better and you will be very satisfied. Google is continually improving this thing too - two updates in two weeks. The updates were noticeable only because the Chrome wrench displayed a tiny dot that told me the system  would be updated upon reboot. When rebooting they did not appear to slow the computers boot time at all still only 8 seconds. Sidebar - (Micr0$oft needs to take a hint here - thirty minutes shutdown installing updates while on battery once and it didn't even ask me if I wanted to!)Tips: You'll want to turn on tap-to-click right away. I have easily converted dvd's from the macbook and threw them on an SD to watch and it plays most of the usual formats (not mkv yet) but mp4 worked fine. MP3's play fine. So as a video and mp3 player it works well, but you will need a memory card to make this work well. Headphones make the sound all better. I'm running an Http file server on my main computer with all the stuff on it so I can use the Chromebook to access its files over the network.Secret: The Chromebook specs says nothing about it having bluetooth. It has a bluetooth chip inside and using some special browser commands it can be turned on, but Google hasn't moved it out of the experimental category yet.

But it means that we may have the ability in the future to use bluetooth headphones or sync/transfer/tether cell phones with it.UPDATE: 6/16/12 - I sold it. My wife complained about internet video playback from netflix and other sites - laggy. With the new os 19 update I lost wifi randomly. I lost connection randomly in the beta of 19 too, but then I was able to restore to 18. Now this was not possible. Samsung/Google only has to make their OS work flawlessly on three computers and they didn't succeed in my eyes. I restored it from the usb stick program - still had same problem. Which BTW the mac version of the restore program is the only one that didn't fail to make the stick. Chromebook sat trying to download it, windows didn't have my model listed. One look at Samsung's website of broken support links and bad ad copy for Chromebook told me - get it working and dump it before it's worthless. Someone else can be troubled to call Samsung and cry on the phone for hours for a fix, but not me. I restored it successfully with the mac created stick, tested the wifi for 10 minutes and put it back in the box.The cloud experience has still been great and I use Chrome browser on a Windows 7 and Mac computer. Sure they take 25 seconds to boot and the updates are more annoying, but I have support and they do everything without complaining.

With the right expectations, this is a great device.I don't know what to call it, since it's not an iPad/tablet and it is not a netbook.  Although it's not either one, you have to look at the reasons why you would get either one.  Here are my items that are important, which may be different than yours:-full web browser-quick boot-cool to the touch-form factor is small, light, and portableWhy get a tablet?  It's quick to turn on from sleep which allows for quick access to information.  It's cool to the touch, so you can use it on your lap or in bed.  It usually has a better battery life than a netbook.  Usually.Why get a netbook/laptop?  You have a full browser, full office suite, and you can run whatever applications you want.Why not get either one?  A tablet doesn't have a full browser!  It might not be a big deal to you... until you start using tablets.  I've used iPhones, iPads, Android phones, Android tablets, HP Touchpads, etc etc.  You're limited by the applications that people will write.  Want to watch Amazon Prime on the iPad?  Sorry, no app for that.  Hulu?  Nope, unless you pay for Hulu+.  Need to type up a paper, sorry, no full office suite (it can be done, but not enjoyably).Want to use your 13-15\" laptop at the coffee shop/library/bookstore for more than 3-5 hours?  You're tied to an outlet source.  (A good laptop could get away with this and most netbooks, but come at a price of $$$ and size).  Want to look up quick information while chatting/watching TV?  Sorry, I've got to wait for my laptop to wake up from sleep (granted, sometimes can be fast, it's not as fast as the Chromebook).  Want to use your laptop in bed/on your lap?  It might be too hot to be comfortable (unless you have a cool running one, which is rare).I wouldn't want to use this as a primary machine, but it's a great portable second device.  If you're around wifi all day and all night, it's something to consider.  You have to get used to the idea that if you were to buy a Windows netbook with the same processor, you'd pay a bit less.  However, you'd lose the quick boot/instant on and the nice keyboard, which are both important to me.  The touchpad needs getting used to, but it's a large surface for this sort of device.I hope more people can see the benefit of this... thing.  From my own experience, the people that complain about the technical specs, usually don't care about form factor: size, weight, battery life.  The people that complain about limited functionality can't get past the idea that people will pay for form factor by compromising functionality (i.e. tablets) or compare this... thing... to a full fledged laptop.

My other machine is i7, 6GB 1080p laptop.As a programmer, I need a decent IDE. I don't think I can easily work without Eclipse. However, for PHP coding, this machine should not be problem. I got shell extension. I can connect to a server and write code in vi. I am very tempted to start coding java in vi too. I am also looking for some good IDE extensions that can connect to my server and work with Java, and J2EE.I also work with Powerpoint presentations, Excel, Word. I tried using Microsoft Office 365 web solution but it sucks. So I just upload files in Google docs, work with them, download in MS format, and upload on our company's sharepoint. It is not a perfect solution. It sometimes messes up the formatting but it get the job done. I guess I will continue doing same thing on this laptop. (My company is cool enough to let us use our own laptops.)I also do a lot of video & photo editing. I doubt I can do any decent video/photo editing on this machine.But now the main reason why I am writing this review. It seems most people still don't get the concept of cloud. I even had to explain this to my techy coworkers. So imagine average people. This is where Apple shines in making sure that consumers understand what they are selling.So far the best explanation I have come up with is that this is like an iPad with a keyboard and no touch screen. If you are planning on buying an iPad or another tablet and you know you are going to be typing a lot on it, then consider this as a better option.As a matter of fact, I got this because I was eyeing tablets. For me I hate to carry my expensive laptop on road-trips, meetings, coffee shops, in bed. My cellphone is good enough for looking up info. But creating a word doc, or writing a blog post is tedious on my cellphone. I already have Kindle for reading books. So I wanted a tablet really for working on documents, spreadsheets, and writing blog posts. Writing quick pieces of code by ssh-ing into our servers.However, with tablets you have to buy an external keyboard. I hate it when keyboard takes up half the screen. Also Android lets you run multiple apps at once but switching between apps is not smooth. You cannot run 2 apps side by side in tablets.Still, a tablet with an external keyboard seemed like a good solution until I saw chromebook. With chromebook, I don't have to worry about carrying a keyboard with me. It also seems lighter. No need of a stand either. Switching tabs is easier. You can run 2 ssh sessions side by side in chromebook but cannot do in any of tablet apps I seen. (I got Evo, my wife has iPad).Now the bad parts is that it doesn't have so many games as iPad or Android. But for games I have my phone and my ps3. Also screen resolution is not that high like in tablets. Yes it is not touch screen.I will explore it more and update my review. I just wanted to tell people that instead of buying a tablet an da keyboard, get this. :)", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't let the bad reviews scare you", "Author": "Bryan Peake", "ReviewID": "R2T4NPNIA7D82T", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "What is the first thing you do when you get on a Windows computer at home?

Kind of plain looking to be honest, and given a review I had seen by Endgadget, I guess I expected something a little \"sexier\" looking.However, having used this now for the last two days, I have changed my mind.  The build quality is very good, rugged, which I like since I'm always going to be pulling it out of my bag and using constantly.  My Asus slimline laptop was a great machine but over time, with the amount of times I open and close the lid, pull from bag, lug around everywhere I go, it look a beating and the hinges became worn down and not as sturdy.The feel of this machine is much different.  This feels like a higher end laptop without all the extra Func keys that quite frankly I rarely if ever used.The keyboard is the easiest I have ever typed on, with great response back with each key press.  I'm a touch typer and this makes it really enjoyable to type with.One REALLY ANNOYING feature that I am starting to really not like.  The SD card slot is placed on the left front of the machine.  The issue here is that the SD card actually sticks out a little from the slot, and over time, my left palm rubs on this over and over, and it actually becomes really uncomfortable.  It's actually my wrist as well when I shift to my lap from a table.  Just really strange that the SD card does not extend further into the machine.  It also looks really strange kind of sticking out there, and when placed in my bag, it's already been pushed out accidentally.  Ugh.Now, if you are used to the Windows experience, this will take some getting used to for you.  This device is meant for you to separate yourself from Microsoft and all the software that goes along with it.  Since my company uses Salesforce for our CRM, Box.net to store ALL of our company files, this was a REALLY easy transition for me.We use Google docs as well, but not for everything.  Therefore, when I do to download a .doc or .xls file, it does not recognize it nor can it open it.  What you have to do is use Google Docs and upload the copy of the downloaded file onto Google Docs.I also downloaded the Live Office app found on the Appstore for Chrome which makes it really easy to read all these types of files.  It's so easy that I can actually run a PPT file from that program and it really looks better to me than on my old machine.The experience of living in the cloud is much different, but because I am used to it for a while now, there's very little pain for me.  I also have a Motorola Xoom tablet so I am able to watch my videos and listen to music on that device.  If you have MP4 or audio files, you can watch them or listen to them easily on the Chromebook.  However, be aware that this is not a HiDef device so the quality is not nearly as good as on a tablet or higher end laptop.  That's really not the point anyway is it?Battery life is REALLY good on this device.  They say about 8.5 hours is standard.  However, I have used it all day, checking email, writing documents, surfing the web, etc pretty heavily and non stop.  I, from a full charge, turned on my Chromebook at 645am and at 933pm, I still have 15% left on the battery.  That's really borderline insane in my opinion.  I have the brightness set kind of low, around 25%, but still, that's REALLY really good.  I only closed the lid for about 30 minutes total all day.Speaking of that, as advertised, from a cold start, literally up and running in 8 seconds.  However, when you first turn it on, there's a set up process that takes about 15 minutes since it will need to download a software update already.  Who cares though.8 seconds from a cold start and less than a second when it was sleeping and you open the lid.  LOVE THAT!Of course, everything is not all rosey.I have found that the viewing angles on this are borderline POOR.  Meaning, you really need to be looking at the screen straight on or else the screen gets REALLY washed out to the point of unreadable.  And this is the frustrating part.  In review from Joanna @ Endgadget, she said viewing angles were good.  I 100% disagree with that statement.  I am typing this review on the Chromebook and I have to have the lid tilted back beyond 90 degrees in order to see it clearly.  This to be is the biggest disappointment for this device.That being said, the screen gets incredibly bright at it's highest setting, and because it's a matte screen, sitting in the sun is no big deal at all.  I sat outside for about an hour today and had zero issues seeing the screen.  What a difference from my older Asus and really different than my Xoom.  Yes, I know, matte screens are designed for that...I get it.  But it's REALLY great to have a laptop that I can see outside on with no problems.The speakers are actually decent on Chromebook.  I was surprised by how loud they got when I had a Youtube Video running with music.  Passable and maybe a little better than passable.There is no fan running and no noise at all coming from my machine.  That's GREAT, and in terms of heat, it generates very little at all...very slight warmth...not even really noticeable.  I used to have a Lenovo X301 and that device got so hot I could not keep it on my lap and the palm rest the same.  No issues at all with Chromebook.If you have never used Chrome browser, this is going to take getting used to.  There is no desktop at all.  There's nothing but the browser and then apps that you see on the main screen when you boot up.  That's all there is to it.For now, there's no offline access, but I hear that will be coming within the next two months.  Therefore, without an internet connection, you are dead in the water and machine will not work.  That's the biggest difference here.  So unless your airplane as wireless option, all you can do it watch a movie if you have the SD card stuck in there.And remember, movies don't look all that great, so might want to have another alternative.  Some would say that why not just use a tablet and that's it.  Well, as I stated, I have one.  And I HATE typing on it.  I did get a BT keyboard for it, but I had to get a stand, turn BT on/off, and sometimes, the connection was flaky on it.  Yeah, I know, poor me.  But really, it's about convenience.  Not only that, but trying to do PPT on tablet, which can be done, was not easy and made too many mistakes with that option.I do think the $500 pricetag is a big CON with this.  But, understanding I am an early adopter, that's the price you will pay.  And honestly, the build quality on Samsung Chromebook is better than some netbooks and even some laptops that I have used.So, overall, I give this device 4 stars.  I'm tempted to take it down to 3.5 but that would be based off of screen viewing angles so instead, I'll deduct 1 star in total for that issue.  The SD card I'm tempted to take a half star away, but really, I will wait to see on that one.If you need a device and you are living in the cloud, this is going to be the device for you.  Click BUY next to that screen and get it now. You will not be disappointed.But if you feel you cannot separate yourself from Microsoft and all the software you are dependent on, than this is not for you.  Students will LOVE this as well.  It does have something called Scratchpad that is a note taking program.  It pops up in the lower right hand corner of the screen and when you take notes, it automatically saves it for you in The Cloud.  You get a Google Docs account and your notes are saved right there.As a matter of fact, when you close the lid, and you are in the middle of something, it saves that as well.  It's great.  No lost data EVER.  Stored right on the cloud.I will provide updates as I start to really dive in, but so far, 48 hours in, and for the most part, I'm very happy with what I have in my hands.UPDATE:Day 4, and I'm humming along nicely.  Still love the instant on and sleep features.PROS:1. Sturdy high end build and look (people complained about plastic lid? I think it looks and feels great)2. Keyboard is fantastic for touch typers3. Instant On and Sleep modes4. Fantastic battery life...with medium to heavy use getting 10+ hours on single charge5. Screen brightness is excellent6. Audio/speakers above average for this type of device7. No fan, no sound, no heat8. Track pad, for me, easy to use and works well.9. Removal of non essential FUNC keys replaced with essential web based keysCONS:1. Location of SD card slot is poor and annoying2. Screen viewing angles are borderline terrible3. No real good file manager4. More lag and delay on websites than expected5. Price is about $100-$150 higher than it should be, but it is early adopter range6. Just slightly heavy...think netbook and add just a little weight.Right now, on day 4, I'm really getting used to this and settling in.  I find myself reaching more for this than my Xoom when I want to do emails, calendar, documents, etc.  I reach for my Xoom when I want to do more web surfing only, video, music playback.  While Chromebook is capable of the latter, I prefer Xoom for these.More updates within the next two weeks.  I have 25 days to decide whether to keep or return, and right now, I'm leaning on keeping.  My company employs a small field sales force, and I'm seriously considering recommending this over Xoom or another Android Tablet.EDIT 9/12/11:Been using it for quite a while now, and with the updates they've sent out for this, I have seen big improvements.  First, there is now a file manager added, not the one where you have to go to setting but separate entirely.Second, I like the layout better for wifi and battery indicators.Thrid, NETFLIX ADDED...and it works great as well...no stuttering at all.Fourth, and not sure why, but battery life does seem a little worse.  I was using it to type some emails and more lengthy documents and only gave me 4 hours of battery life...strange since I was getting up tp 10 since I do not watch video all that much on it.  Screen brightness was even toned down.I am now so used to this machine and using cloud things are easier and seemless.  Machine is still super fast, easy to type on, and I bet a lot of compliments on the white model.Something I think needs to be corrected though is wifi connection seems to drop easy.  I will be on a wifi connection and suddenly it's not connected and looking for one...can get annoying.Highly recommended. ...still", "Date": "June 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Portability.

(You have to press down the touchpad to left click and press with 2 fingers for right click).I know a lot of people think this device is useless if there is no internet available.

Instead I purchased a Chromebook a few months ago and have been very impressed since.The Chromebook is very light and has long battery life (not as long as advertised, but I find it to last around 6.5 hours on an average day.) The keyboard is very nice and the track pad is probably the best that i have ever seen on any non-mac computer. My only complaint is that there is currently not any option to change track pad sensitivity, but in general it is big and very easy to use.In terms of software, the Chromebook does everything it advertises. It turns on in less than 8 seconds and resumes from sleep almost instantly.As a student, I only use my computer for 3 things. The Internet, writing documents, and Photoshop.It is extremely quick at loading an average web page, but it can sometimes lag if you go on a page with lots of flash based content.I started using Google docs to write my papers almost a year ago but since getting a Chromebook I use it for almost everything that I write. Google docs saves every 3 seconds, it can be accessed from anywhere, and it is very useful for projects where collaboration is required. I have started to find Google docs more convenient than Microsoft word especially when editing things on multiple computers.While you can edit basic things through the integrated Picasa photo editor, their is not substitute to Photoshop on a Chromebook, but considering the price I did not expect to be editing pictures on a netbook.Overall, the Chromebook is not a substitute for a full computer, but it is extremely effective at what it is designed to do.

I ordered the 3g version of the Samsung Chromebook and was immediately impressed with the boot up time and the HUGE battery life, which was about 8-11ish hours depending on how many videos I watched on Netflix or other sites (yes, netflix does work on the Chromebook). After playing with the settings and googling around, I started to also play with the about:flags options which can be accessed by just typing about:flags into the search bar. Having enabled several of the options in the about:flags, I was able to get the trackpad to become even more of a joy to use and the 720p videos on youtube to run even smoother. The chromebook is definitely a solid product and I don't think I would get any other netbook. Sure the prices may seem a bit higher than some other netbooks, but do remember that you are also getting a very nice and bright screen and a very spacious keyboard. The 16gb of storage does not even bother me one bit, but I do only use it to take notes for class using Scratchpad, watch videos on Netflix, Youtube, Hulu, etc, and to Web browse. The free 100mb a month for 2 years that comes with the 3g model is another plus, but if that is too little for you, just plop in your sim card.

The first thing I have to rave about is the battery life. It really goes 8.5 hours. And it really does wake from sleep instantly and boot in 8 seconds. No joke. I have used the Wifi in four places so far and it hooked up and remembered each. I also was able to hookup the free 3G (100 megs a months for two years, enough for email and light stuff when not near a wifi.)It does take a bit to get used to its different way of working. It is a little different. Yes you cannot load software onto your machine - and in fact -  there is no hard drive in the old read-write-head-on-a-spinning-platter sense, just a 16 gig Solid State Drive where the OS resides, along with a minimal amount of user storage. The operating system gets updated automatically in the background as improvements are made and bugs are fixed. You don't even notice it.There might be no programs, but there are an evergrowing crop of  Web \"Apps\" you can choose. They work with Flash or with HTML5. Google is working on its own custom version of flash called Pepper. It's much safer, but still a bit buggy. For now, to use your webcam and mic for recording you will have to go into settings and disable the Pepper-flash. Be sure to re-enable it when you are done recording.Other kinds of apps work fine and there are a wide variety of them. And you can use them online in real-time. Sites like drawing on pixlr.com or deviantArtMuro or photoshop.com, and upload your creations to say picasa or box.net, or save to a thumb drive or a memory card. There are games like Angry Birds and useful functional things like Google Docs and Calendar. Even an app to track your blood pressure. Amazon Instant Video and Mp3 Cloud-Player work very well on it and there's a Kindle reader too.  I've also made google voice phone calls from it without a hitch.I think this is the future of computing. Someday, when you need  heavy duty computer - you will go somewhere and rent the use of one for an hour or two. Like you might use a Zipcar for half a day.

It feels solid, not cheap.The screen is excellent - clear, matte and bright.The keyboard is also superb, and a pleasure to work on.The trackpad isn't as good - I found myself wanting to use a mouse, though I've not tested one yet with the Chromebook.The lack of Bluetooth functionality is a bit annoying, especially if you'd prefer to use a wireless mouse.The initial setup takes between 10 and 15 minutes, including setting up Verizon's free 100Mb per month. That process was clumsy and annoying, and I find the data prices to be slightly absurd. I already pay $35 a month for data on my iPad, and I feel like I should be able to share this data with my Chromebook.Once everything has been setup, the startup time is incredibly fast; less than 5 seconds the first time in after setup.Everything feels fast and effective, and it is odd not having a desktop but just a browser window.I use Chrome on all other platforms, so it feels very natural here. I use Google Docs a lot, having published 3 books using it as a collaborative tool. The Series 5 handles those online apps with ease.The Series 5 feels like a laptop, not a netbook. The form factor is just the right size to get some work done, as long as you have an internet connection (since the free 100mb a month doesn't really amount to much). I would use this over the iPad to get work done on the go, though the iPad is obviously a more versatile device. If I was traveling for a couple of days, I might bring the Series 5 instead of my 13\" Macbook Pro, though only if I didn't intend to get any \"heavy\" work done.All-in-all a solid start to the Chromebook line. If you're looking for a simple, uncomplicated device for web browsing and some light work (though increasingly more serious work can be done via Google docs), then you might want to think about a Chromebook and in particular, the Samsung Series 5.

First, I am a test pilot user and find the product refreshing and highly useful. But I just dont know why Google didnt go ahead and offer a tablet version and 2 or 3 netbook versions (a wifi and a 3g, which should be a 4g) instead of the 5 netbook versions? People want tablets! Besides, it would do what android tablets havent been able to do. Also, android and its marketplace are at a critical junction with the fragmentation that is occurring, sure to cause consternation both in the consumer and the developer world, as its lifespan continues.Most important for Chrome OS survivability is the fact that web and software developers will have to tailor and support their programs for Chrome, which will take a while but undeniably will happen, once the popularity of the OS and cloud computing usage in general increases, but first a price drop for these devices; Google must get them into the hands of everyone with a couple of extra dollars in their pockets and the desire to find a new OS (which there are many of), even if it means doing it at a loss (see: the kindle). Eventually Google is going to run into the classic \"guns versus butter\" quandary with all its operating systems out there. Ill place my money on its ONLY TRUE OPEN OS, the Chrome OS (android is by invite only until Google decides to release version's source code). Chrome is more than just a browser, any browsing on goggle labs will convince you of that! So why not capitalize on its unified design/operating concept and install it as an OS? This is what many people dont \"get about Chrome as an OS, the say \"I have chrome on my computer already\"...in a few years pretty much all of your operations will exist in/on the cloud.SOME GOOD:  All of the chromebooks weigh in at about 3lbs, or twice the wight of the ipad2, which is still very light. Also, battery life is pretty identical to the advertised specs.  Boot time is ridiculously fast, less than 10 secs from a dead sleep! Amazon's cloud player is integrated very, very nicely integrated. Most important Chrome OS function: you DONT have to pay for web applications as you do with iOS or Android OS (unless site owners wish to charge for content, that is).SOME BAD:  No HDMI but a VGA instead (yeah, I know, its 2011). No bluetooth, NO GPS, webcam issues, cant use USB drives...most of the issues (I did not list several others) can be patched through updates. However some are hardware and will need to be addressed next production run or model design.  I recommend any of the SAMSUNG chromebooks w/the dual core Atom n570 cpu.The cpu will cut down significantly on streaming video stuttering that the acer chromebook will see (only the acer wifi only version has the N570, but a smaller screen though; as of June 2011 pay the few extra dollars and get the Samsung 3g unit...  On a final note: I almost wish I hadnt bought my ipad2, but I got tired of waiting for the chromebook to release and needed a portable computing device(I dont use windows netbook/laptops or Mac's. I will however grudgingly settle for chrome on a netbook). I suppose now  I can now wait for chrome OS to be released on a tablet before letting go of the ipad; hopefully a Chrome OS tablet will come before xmas.", "Date": "May 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Both and hardware and software needs more work", "Author": "Bhaumin Shah", "ReviewID": "R1B2SUSQ26ZZW3", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Was not satisfied with the hardware as well as software:-Some of the keys did not work perfectly (h,m).

Google's vision of cloud-connected devices falls apart if you are in a place where connectivity is not possible or simply unaffordable. In-flight or out in the boondocks, for instance. With this device no connection means you have a glorified brick in your hands.3. This is where I think all boils down to. What does this computer do (disregarding Google's marketing and hype)? It's an internet terminal ... and that's it. It will not edit your videos, it doesn't run Photoshop, it doesn't run any local games (or Steam, for that matter), you can't install any of your favorite content authoring software, can't play CDs/DVDs, doesn't have family censorship tools and let's not even talk about how utterly useless this device is for those in the software development field. And all that would be perfectly fine if point 1 and 2 above weren't there. If this machine were, say, $150 the tradeoffs would make perfect sense. You're trading usability/utility for an inexpensive device. But at current prices, it's simply not worth it. Too many alternatives, too many limitations. In essence you are paying a few hundred dollars for a Chrome web browser (which, by the way, can be FREELY downloaded and installed on just about ANY computer).My, so-called TL;DR: Neat machine, poor utility, poor value.", "Date": "June 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great if you are always on.

In fact, I use Google's services for an awful lot. I am using a browser window 75%+ of the time I am using a computer. But there are times when I do not have connectivity and still need to be productive.This is where Chromebook comes up short: highly limited offline capabilities. Chromebook needs to be able to reach Google's servers in order to authenticate you. Otherwise you have to log in as a guest. But if you do that, you can't save any data because it will be wiped out when you log out. This is a problem when you have WiFi on planes or hotels that require you to log in or sign up before your device can connect to the internet.If most of what you do online involves web-based services, and you find yourself in places with WiFi 99% of the time, this may actually fit your needs. It also makes a great second computer.I would recommend getting a fuller-fledged notebook -- Macbook Air, an ultraportable Dell -- if you find yourself on planes and in hotels a lot and want to do work.

It is nice and thin, but feels pretty flimsy. The display is OK, not awesome, but doesn't suck either. I don't like the keyboard; I'm always mis-typing keys. The power supply cable worries me a bit: the pin is very small and the whole thing does not feel like it quite fits right. The worst is the trackpad, and I'm not sure how much of this is software or hardware/driver but it is absolutely terrible. No amount of adjusting the sensitivity seems to get it to feel right; the cursor is jumpy, scrolling is erratic, etc. I'd say, if you like a large screen and don't care about quality too much, then this might be the product for you. But if you prefer a better build quality and don't care so much about size, you might consider a different netbook as you could get one for right around the same price point.I'll leave the review of ChromeOS for someone else/someplace else but I would definitely advise anyone getting a Chromebook to make sure they understand the differences between the ChromeOS \"the system is a browser\" approach versus a traditional operating system...you may be in for some surprises.", "Date": "July 26, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0067U9W7Y"}}
