{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Machine", "Author": "A. Sacremento \"car guy\"", "ReviewID": "R6JW1B4XX80SU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "After searching for just the right laptop for months, I've just acquired two of these Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p laptops (the 59370005 configuration), one for myself and one for my wife. These machines ROCK! I say this not simply because of their performance, but because they also shipped with the right software.Lenovo deserves serious kudos for these laptops. Not only are they blazing fast and put together like Rolex watches, but Lenovo has preloaded them with some software to make life with Win8 really quite nice. As most already know, Win8 relies on Microsoft's new \"Modern UI\" interface, which sports an ill-advised \"Start Screen\" better suited for smart phones and tablets than PC's. Realizing this is a terrible arrangement for anybody who needs to use his PC to perform any real work, Lenovo has included the Pokki Menu with these machines. The Pokki Menu is the coolest, most powerful Start menu I've ever seen, bar none. It's wonderfully customizable, and once configured to one's preferences, it makes living with Win8 not only painless, but a genuine improvement over Win7. (I never imagined I'd ever make that statement.) Every Win8 machine should ship with this app. It even supports booting the PC directly to the desktop, completely bypassing the hideous Start Screen altogether. Great stuff! Thanks, Lenovo.", "Date": "September 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Full of technology", "Author": "P Diddy", "ReviewID": "RU4GP4M80K5F0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "A lot of these on Amazon don't have DVD drives - this was important for me to have. Be sure to read the descriptions carefully as I bought a different model and had to return it as it didn't have a DVD drive. This thing is super fast, though, and I can really tell a difference with the new Haswell processors. I especially like the OS on the SSD that this has, and you MUST get Full HD 1080p like this one has (again, something to be careful of as many others just have the poor 1366x768 resolution, which is a HUGE difference!). This is one heck of a powerful laptop that I hope will last for a long time.", "Date": "August 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "A Good machine for what it was designed for", "Author": "Ronny", "ReviewID": "R2VOV2ZO51YP8J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've been using the Y510P for a few weeks now, and overall it is a good machine, particularly for the price: the screen is big, bright and provides excellent color and resolution, the sound system better than most, the processor and RAM (mine's 8GB) deliver the performance. I can't tell if the 24GB SSD, serving as a buffer for the 1TB HD, really makes a difference, it is definitely slower than an SSD solo.I must say at the outset that I am not a computer games person, so my criticism of this gaming machine is based on using it in ways it may not have been designed for. In any case, here is what I found lacking so far:Windows 8 is not to my taste at all, I'm working on downgrading, and I'd advise others to get Windows 7 preinstalled. Although its search facilities are more powerful than in previous versions, most things are also better hidden, and it is rather frustrating.I am having trouble hooking up to WiFi - sometimes it works, but sometimes it fails, and sometimes it disconnects for no apparent reason when other devices around it (including other Lenovos) chug merrily along. I found no tools that can point to what the trouble may be besides the Windows Troubleshooter which finds nothing wrong and refers me to the Administrator (which happens to be me). It seems to consistently ignore the 5.2GHz channel, although it is configured to use both that and 2.4GHz.The machine is not very portable, at 6 lb, and its battery is good for 4 hours at most - get a spare.Finally, I'd would have liked a fingerprint reader for security.Ronny", "Date": "October 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Buy", "Author": "Mister E", "ReviewID": "R33S1CGBBLD14L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm glad i bought this product. Besides being powerful enough to run the latest games at their highest resolution, the screen seems to be developed using some new technology that gives crisp, bright visuals. Backlit keyboard is extremely useful, and is the feature which turns the most heads about this laptop. And the sound...! I've never heard any laptop speaker perform as powerfully and clearly as this one. Good job, Lenovo.My only gripes are that the touchpad is a pain in the butt to use, and the battery life isn't the best in the world, but that doesn't really take away from the pleasure of owning this laptop too much.", "Date": "May 1, 2014"}, {"Title": "I love it", "Author": "fahad009", "ReviewID": "R1VT7OK9MOS5PL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "good Seller", "Date": "April 25, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good product but with some problems", "Author": "Julien", "ReviewID": "R2DM7BVLGZHEE2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Video and games run well.2 problems:- iphone keeps disconnecting and connection every seconds.
