The Thinkpads are easy to set-up, makes it easy to transfer your files and settings to the new laptop, and is durable for travel.This is my 6th Thinkpad and I bought this one for business travel, but also use it as my home pc.  I did pick-up the \"Ultrabase\" which functions like a docking station to plug in your full size monitor, keyboard and other perhipherals.  The Ultrabase also has a key lock and a cd/dvd drive.The extended battery will add some weight and size to the laptop, but it provided up to 10 hours of computing time!THE LAPTOP DOES NOT HAVE A BUILT IN CD/DVD ROM.  YOU HAVE TO BUY THE EXTERNAL DRIVE SEPARATELY.The smaller size and  2.5 pounds lightened my carry on bag weight.It is also much easier to use in airports or on the plane.I keep my \"travel\" bag with the following:-  power ac charger-  wireless mouse-  USB adapter with 4 ports-  external cd/dvd driveThis is my favorite Thinkpad of all!This is an outstanding laptop, easy to use and the Core Duo makes it lightning quick.One of the best features of the Thinkpad is the \"ThinkCenter\" button for trouble shooting and help.I have a Lenovo laptop at the office and am not happy with it.One of the best features of the Thinkpad is the keyboard.Try it...you'll like it!", "Date": "July 29, 2007"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000EYYLMA"}}
