It is blistering fast, lightweight and compact for someone who travels for a living and has amazing battery life with the 4th gen chip and the ssd. I also have the 128GB drive, found a good deal at Micro Center for $799. One comment - the plastic bezel around the top of the keyboard doesn't seat well and is and looks a little wavy, but not bad enough to warrant a return", "Date": "March 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "Basically a supercharged netbook", "Author": "Vance Hanson", "ReviewID": "R8IBDPIQU4H4K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used to have a $300 Acer Aspire One with a Celeron 877, and this Dell reminds me much of that Acer. The thing is, however, that the Acer is a netbook and this is an ultrabook. Intel should have excluded LED backlighting from the Ultrabook requirements.Such a powerfull ans seemingly good laptop ruined by this grainy, backlit, barely HD display. Oh well, at least it moves at the blink of an eye. Oh, and I have the 128GB SSD version.", "Date": "February 23, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00GT79B80"}}
