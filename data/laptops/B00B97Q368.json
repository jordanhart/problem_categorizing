This is an additional computer in my home (downstairs versus upstairs office).  Price was less than similar laptops as color selection was either Purple or Pink.  I like purple. :)Product delivery was as scheduled (through Amazon Prime).  Box was not damaged; product intact.  When I fired up the laptop, the battery was fully charged.  Setup through Windows 8 was an adjustment as I am upgrading from Windows XP.I have now had the product for two weeks and am totally satisfied.  The screen resolution is excellent.  I must admit I am still getting used to Windows 8, but that's a user problem.  It works well with the wireless router I recently installed.IMPORTANT:  This laptop does not have any software pre-loaded other than Windows 8.  If you do not already have Microsoft Office or other productivity software, you will need to buy it.  Amazon had a special promotion for Microsoft Office 2013, so I bought that.I would definitely recommend the product. :)", "Date": "April 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Dell Inspiron laptop", "Author": "EveningStar", "ReviewID": "R3RWMGZMNV5K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The good: Decent performance and design for a reasonable price; excellent battery life.The bad: Not as customizable as previous Dells; too many built-in advertising pitches.The bottom line: Dell's updated Inspiron line has a slightly revamped design, but more importantly still offers workhorse performance for a minimal investment.", "Date": "April 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Was a great laptop...", "Author": "Elizabeth A. Plunkett \"Voracious Reader\"", "ReviewID": "R2MB0KH4LSG3ZJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this laptop about 2 and a half months ago, everything was going great computer ran smoothly, handling all of my applications well, and then Windows 8 did an automatic update, and(after two weeks of assisted help)according to Dell the update corrupted Windows which in turn, fried the hard drive (I lost everything, files, videos, game data, including my patience). However, Amazon has been very kind to me and allowed me to return for my money back.On another note, although the computer was packed in its original Dell packaging, it did not include the Drivers and Updates disk, nor a Windows restore disk, Dell had to ship them to me, but only after Amazon admitted the seller (Data Master LLC) had no contact information other than a store front name.", "Date": "June 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Overall great computer", "Author": "Donna D.", "ReviewID": "R93YW0RD87P2A", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a great laptop. It boots up quickly, the memory is great, the screen resolution is very good (the overall specs are great for the price) and it looks very sleek and stylish (I love the purple). This is the very first time I'm using windows 8 and trust me I am NOT computer savy, but I don't know why people keep complaining about windows 8, its soooooo easy to operate, imagine my five year old can navigate her way around the apps. I give it five stars because the laptop is great (I like large screen laptops) and windows 8 is GREAT(very user friendly).", "Date": "April 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "So far so good! :-)", "Author": "Michelle", "ReviewID": "RDRACTVL4WP7M", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "So, I received my pretty purple Dell Inspiron 17R last week. I have been using it for about 5 days now. So far, everything is good! I LOVE the computer, but I am NOT in love with Windows 8, but from what I have read and heard from others, I don't think that many people are. If you MUST get a computer with Windows 8, don't worry...there are lots of places online in which you can download software to make your Windows 8 desktop look more like Windows 7, so don't let that deter you from getting this computer. The only other thing that I don't LOVE about this computer is the screen resolution. I have bad eyes and the screen is not as sharp as I would love for it to be, but it also isn't that big of a deal. I am a college student and I spend LOTS of time using my computer. The first day I used this computer, I had a really bad headache...it could have been caused by looking at the computer screen or it could have been caused by many other factors. I'm just kind of bummed that the screen isn't as crisp as that of my old HP laptop. Other than that little minor thing, this computer is AWESOME!! I LOVE the \"island\" keys on the keyboard and the overall feel of this computer. It's a really \"beefy\" looking computer. It's also pretty! (Yes, I am a girl that likes pretty things! :o) ) When I opened the box, both my 4 year old and 6 year old gasped and said, \"OOHH! WOW!!\" Of course they might have had that same reaction about a box within a box. ;-) I am still figuring this computer out and I don't have a lot of \"techie\" knowledge, so I can't offer too much, but I can say that I do really like this computer and am happy with my purchase. :-)", "Date": "April 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Deborah W.", "ReviewID": "RVAIZL2PFI5UN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It came ready to plug in and go.

However, registering the warranty on the refurbished unit was not fun! I could not get technical help from Dell until I provided the seller's name. I never did get that information. Computer Geeks of California was the seller- to me. But, they were unable/unwilling to give me the actual seller's name. I contacted them twice, and was given two seller names. Neither was correct. The woman I spoke to claimed to be the internet sales manager. She said that she was familiar with all refurbished sales. Her offhanded answers to my request were not helpful, and caused me considerable grief. In the end Dell checked to be sure the computer was not stolen, and registered the warranty without the information. Dell was very helpful. Computer Geeks was not. I selected Computer Geeks from a list of sellers because they were a big company. Their price was not the lowest. I thought a big company would give better customer service. It didn't turn out that way.", "Date": "June 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "refurbished computer", "Author": "bobbi collett", "ReviewID": "R2X8KFJX35QHG0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "wow what a deal.
