It deletes the pictures constantly, has awful quality images and a tiny view screen. Also the driver files are not all on the tiny diskette and not available on the manufacturer web site either. Forget about customer service because they do not reply.ONLY BUY THIS AS A TOY FOR A 2 YEAR OLD IF IT COSTS UNDER $5.00", "Date": "May 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not worth it at all!", "Author": "M. Richardson", "ReviewID": "R16YL2ST89PS1Q", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "We are very disappointed with this camera.  The batteries barely fit into the holes, the screen is tiny and blurry. We bought 2 of them for our sons and one of them won't turn off without opening the battery compartment.  The problem is, once you open the battery compartment all the pictures get deleted.  Total waste of money and we haven't even tried to upload the pics yet.  That should be an adventure.", "Date": "August 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "NO GOOD CAMERA", "Author": "K.

My son got this camera as a Christmas gift, took about 10 pictures with it which were deleted, and we were never able to load the software which froze up my computer.  It's total trash!!", "Date": "December 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "Worse toy ever!", "Author": "Kristi", "ReviewID": "R3AM3CZQXFCNI3", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Like everyone else says, it deletes photos (very upset kid on my hands now). Can't even get photos that ARE on it onto pc. Wish the company would do something about this. How can they just sell something that doesn't work?

Camilo", "ReviewID": "R2XUWG1W1KQ22M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I didn't bought this camera. It was gifted to me when I bought a Dell laptop. Even so, it's so ridiculous that made me angry - even for free. It's a cheap piece of plastic with something that resembles a LCD viewfinder that must be around one inch wide. But never mind the size: the resolution is so low that you can't see nothing, anyway. The buttons seems to be falling off every time they are pressed. It needs a proprietary USB cable to connect to the computer... but no cable came in the package.My son always uses my Sony T50 and my iPhone, so you can imagine how happy he was with this camera. One day and it was laying around the floor, like some cheap toy - which really defines this camera.It is absolutely a shame that Geroge Lucas actually licensed this piece of crap. And I got it for free. Imagine how pissed I'd be if I had paid more than 80 bucks for it...", "Date": "October 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Bad BAD camera", "Author": "gwallie", "ReviewID": "R3B59G0ZE58D79", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "My son wanted to start taking his own pics and is crazy for star wars so when he saw this he went crazy!  Now it is driving us crazy!  The pictures delete themselves once you take them- the batteries drain like crazy, there is no flash so the pics come out dark.Save your money, and make your child happy by NOT buying them this and and spend a little extra money on a better camera.", "Date": "July 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "So-so", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R3TX06GB1MNLQA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased for my nephew's 6th birthday.
