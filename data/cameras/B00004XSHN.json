Still, there are a few areas where Fuji really failed.  The most annoying is that you cannot buy an adapter for mounting filters to the lens.  When you pay this much for a camera with a good lens, you should be able to protect it with an inexpensive clear filter.  As it stands, you have to buy an expensive macro adapter you may not need in order to get the filter ring.  This seems like a customer-unfriendly approach.The autofocus is very slow in all but the most ideal conditions.  You can't capture an expression on someone's face indoors (even in a brightly lit room) unless you go to manual focus.  Also, battery life is too short, especially when the spares they sell are expensive and have a lower capacity than the original equipment.I know this sounds very negative, but in fact the camera is very good in other ways.  I have taken some very nice pictures with it.  Just think carefully about what you want out of any digital camera before you buy.", "Date": "June 27, 2001"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Camera", "Author": "Carmen R.

[Now I've had it for nearly seven years,... still works fine, still delivers!]It is the first digital that I've bought, and I specifically chose one with full exposure control to use in photographing small zoological specimens. I also have the wide angle lens adapter and a set of close-up lenses, plus a few filters.It performs its intended function very well: I use it to record scientific images of a kind of marine snail known as a cowry. The aperture control allows improved depth of field in the close-up work that I do.This is a well-executed design. I like the 'feel' of its grip-type right side. The optics seem to be everything that they should and the wide angle lens seems to be about the equivalent of a 28mm on a 35mm camera. (The lens-to-extender threading can be difficult to put together, so be careful! Fortunately, the extender itself threads onto the camera body much more readily.)Bearing in mind that I rated the Fuji FinePix 4900 at five stars, let me pick a nit: the lens cap needed further thought! Clearly \"designed\" to be attached at the left side of the camera, it should have had a clip on it to attach it to the neck strap when it was not on the lens. It is very difficult to control this cap unless it is on the right side of the camera, where you can grip it by its lanyard with the hand that you're going to keep on the camera.I have yet to employ all of this camera's features but those that I have used work as they should.

The resolution is so good, that you can zoom in on the individual pores of a persons face.

Better manual focus feel; the electronic focus steps just doesn't feel like an analog one, you know what I mean if you are familiar with regular SLR cameras3. Faster recharge time; the included charger needs 5+ hours, I decided to buy a generic quick charger + battery4. No B function for long exposureIf you are taking photography class, this is a good and affordable camera to own.

I think the one big negative point about this model is the poor battery life.  If you use the flash and the LCD display, expect about 40 shots before you get the low battery indicator.  I would recommend purchasing a second battery and charger for long trips.The LCD viewfinder is another problem.  The image you get from using the viewfinder isn't very clear in low light situations.  My previous digital camera was the Fuji MX-2900 which had an optical viewfinder.  If you get a chance to compare an LCD viewfinder to an optical one-you would agree that the optical works better.  This also puts another strain on the battery life issue too.Enough on the negatives.  The best part about this camera is the image quality.  It's excellent and I love the 6X optical zoom.
