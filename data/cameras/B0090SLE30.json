{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nikon P7700: High performance, very few compromises", "Author": "John Williamson", "ReviewID": "R29ZUHUXWIMB8D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The new Nikon COOLPIX P7700 was announced in the late summer of 2012 as the company's Performance-series flagship, a camera designed with the true photo enthusiast in mind. As a current owner of the Nikon COOLPIX P7100, I was curious as to what improvements might have been made.Read a good number of first-look previews, then decided that it was worth a second look. I luckily had a chance for a short hands-on local preview, along with a few other cameras as noted below, then decided that there were enough features and improvements that made the P7700 well worth considering, so I put in my order here on Amazon and waited for it to be released.It's a decision that I don't regret. Getting down to the subjective nitty-gritty, here are my basic observations.\u25c6 Pros:+ Substantial 7.1x optical zoom; extra punch over 4x or 5x helps+ Fully articulated 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD display; extra sharp at 921,000 dots+ New 12.2 Megapixel CMOS-type sensor; offers excellent image quality+ Improved ergonomics; rational array of controls, easy to master+ Rechargeable EN-EL14 Li-ion battery; averages 320 - 350 shots per charge+ Full manual exposure plus Program, Aperture- and Shutter priority modes+ Much faster operational speeds than the P7000 or P7100+ Uses readily available SD, SDHC and SDXC memory cards; full support+ RAW (NRW) support; 19 Scene modes for creative control+ ISO range is 80-1600; can be boosted to 6400+ Accepts any \u00d840.5 mm filters; compatible with Nikon 1 series+ Hot shoe; accepts wide variety of Nikon Speedlight units or GP-1 GPS Unit+ Rubberized grip area on the body; adds to handling\u25c6 Cons:- As with the P7100, wish this camera would go to 24mm wide angle- Picky point: 40.5mm lens cap has easy-to-bump tabs making it easy to lose\u25c6 First Impressions:There was little about the new P7700 of which I wasn't aware before my Amazon order arrived and it came out of the box. Had read a number of editorial comments and had a brief hands-on locally. When first unboxed, it's immediately noticeable that this is a solid camera, and that's probably due to its magnesium chassis.  There's a definite professional feel to the P7700, similar to the older P7100, yet in a more refined package.Followed the printed Quick Start Guide and charged the battery for the recommended 1\u00bd hours while reading and going through the box contents.  This camera came packaged with the following:~ AN-CP22 Strap~ UC-E17 USB Cable~ EG-CP16 Audio Video Cable~ EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-ion Battery~ MH-24 Quick Charger~ LC-CP26 Lens Cap~ NikonView NX 2 CD-ROM~ P7700 Reference Manual on CD-ROM~ Printed Quick Start Guide~ Yellow Nikon USA Warranty CardThe MH-24 Battery Charger blinks when charging, and glows steadily when the battery is topped up.  I put the battery cap in a safe place for when it's needed, and once the battery was charged, inserted a Class 10 SDHC card and took the P7700 out for a trial run to get a feel for it, carrying my older and more familiar P7100 along as a comparison.Though I had briefly played with this P7700 before, I now had a chance to really put it through its paces. Larger than most compacts, this camera subjectively has quite a comfortable feel; everything seems to fit the hand and eye quite easily.  There are enough controls and options that can be set to customize it to ones individual preferences, and in my initial explorations, found that this was easy to accomplish.\u25c6 The P7700 In Use:As expected, the camera offers complete PSAM control from the top dial near the shutter button, but the small Quick Menu dial on the left top of the camera body quickly became my ally.  This made access of the various functions such as ISO settings, white balance, auto bracketing and such to be far easier than exploring the camera menus.  Tried various shots trying face detection, the different metering settings and such, all as part of the learning experience.  This shortcut method is far better than digging into the viewfinder menus to access the various features, and it's fully customizable.  Still working my way through all of the automation features, but there are nineteen Scene modes offering some very artistic in-camera effects.The small optical viewfinder that was found on the P7100 is gone, yet for this user it's not missed much, as this new P7700 comes with a fully articulated 3-inch Vari-Angle LCD display. The P7100 has a tilting 3-inch LCD display, which is quite good, but this new one is as versatile as those found on some of the Nikon DSLRs. It offers a brilliant and very sharp screen, offering very close to 100% of what your results will be, and for one who wears glasses, those 921,000 dots do help.  Being fully articulated, it allows for creativity from some fairly awkward angles, and as I have made good and frequent use of this feature on my D5000, I'm pleased to have it on this camera. Reverse the screen before you put the P7700 away and the LCD is protected.Once one gets used to the P7700, and that doesn't very take long, the ergonomics and controls are excellent.  I'm just the occasional video shooter, but the resolution has been increased from 720p to full 1080p HD on the P7700. The video exposure can be controlled using aperture-priority, auto, manual, or custom movie modes, and the autofocus remains active while shooting videos. There's a built-in stereo microphone, an external microphone jack, and an HDMI mini connector & HDMI-CEC support.The built-in flash on the P7700 does a decent job for snapshots, and the results are better than those from the P7100. Have no complaints with the results within the abilities of how these function.  But when I attached and used the Nikon SB-400, the resulting images were close to dazzling.  I've used my SB-400 and the older SB-600 on my Nikon DSLRs, but this combination on the P7700 helped produce some of my best flash images ever.\u25c6 The Lens and More:Where the P7700 really shines is in the lens, and that was apparent within the first twenty or so images.  The 7.1x Zoom-Nikkor ED lens offers a 35mm peer to that of 28-200mm zoom lens, and even though its range is the same as the P7100, the new camera offers a construction of 13 elements in 10 groups, as compared to 11 elements in 9 groups for my older camera.  Add to this, the P7700 has a maximum aperture of f/2.0 (at 28mm) to f/4.0 (at 200mm), where the P7100 has a maximum of f/2.8 at its widest setting.But no description of the lens would be complete without mentioning that the built-in neutral density filter added to its 7-blade rounded iris aperture offers beautifully natural bokeh, better than this user has encountered in a compact digital camera. Just beginning to explore this, but my results have been quite pleasing.One of the more appealing things about the P7700 is that finally we have an enthusiast's compact Nikon that can take filters, a big improvement over my P7100.  This now moves the camera into the corner of a compact for the serious user, as the ability to use non-proprietary \u00d840.5mm filters adds to this camera's capabilities. These filters are also used with the Nikon 1 series of cameras, and there's a forthcoming optional \u00d840.5mm threaded HN-CP17 lens hood where you can also use \u00d858mm filters if you like.Though not as common as other sizes, there are plenty of \u00d840.5mm filters avalable, and in all sizes and grades. For those interested, there's a bargain priced Vivitar Series 1 Three-Piece Multi-Coated HD Pro Filter Set. The better grade Hoya 40.5mm UV HMC Filter sits on the end of my P7700 at all times.\u25c6 Other Observations:The inclusion of the Nikon EN-EL14 Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery and the MH-24 charger is welcomed by this user, as it's the same one used in the P7100, P7000 and a variety of Nikon DSLRs. For those who already own any of these models, it means a logical system approach to carrying extra batteries, along with a decent cost savings. I've had a few of these from the other Nikons, and am getting an average of 320 to 350 shots per charge from them. This battery even gives notice when calibration is necessary.On the downside, this camera comes standard with a Nikon LC-CP26 lens cap. The downside to this particular cap is that it has easy-to-bump tabs, making it easy to lose.  If you lose yours and want a better replacement, this Nikon LC-N40.5 Front Lens Cap from the Nikon 1 series cameras works.\u25c6 Warranty Note:I purchased my P7700 here from Amazon directly, and it came with a Nikon USA 1-year yellow warranty card. There was a brief flurry when it was discovered that some of us could not register our new cameras with Nikon USA at the site on the card. This was cleared up completely in less than twelve hours when it was discovered that there had been a clerical database error on Nikon's side. If you have a similar problem, just contact Nikon and they will straighten it out quickly.\u25c6 Other Cameras Considered:Along with the new P7700, I had seriously considered the Sony DSC-RX100, the Fujifilm X10 and the Canon PowerShot G15. All of these were superb products, but keeping it simple, the Nikon P7700 won me over with its combination of an exceptionally good f/2.0 28-200mm Nikkor zoom lens, its fully articulated 3-inch LCD display, a real dedicated hot shoe and its ability to use filters. The Fuji, Sony and Canon are highly recommended products worth considering from my recent hands-on experiences, but we all have different priorities and requirements, and the bottom line was that the Nikon P7700 met my needs best. Your needs may be different.\u25c6 A Frank Editorial Admission:Like many of us, I spent far too much time reading online reviews about the new digital gear that was being released in 2012, making personal notes and trying to remain objective, as my brand loyalty in ownership spreads to not just Nikon but to Fujifilm and Canon. I got caught up in sensor sizes, image processors and such. But at one point I finally stopped, as even the best reviewers and sites do seem to have their repeated subjective favorites. What matters here is that we buy cameras like this to create images, and not to wear around our necks as status badges. What works for you may not work for me, and vice versa. The key to this is to research your camera, then find what will do the best job for you. I found it with this camera, and it works quite well for me.\u25c6 [Update] 10/20/2012:An acquaintance who read this review right after it was posted was prompted to immediately buy the P7700 from a local NYC retailer. I heard about it from the individual by phone that same evening when I was informed that my advice was \"wrong\" and that \"the camera doesn't work,\" though it had worked in the store when the sales rep had tested it after inserting the battery. I asked the individual a few quick questions, and within 60 seconds we found the problem, and it's right there in the supplied Quick Start Guide in Step 4 on page 9, where it states: \"When the monitor is closed and with the screen facing inward, the power cannot be turned on even if the power switch is pressed.\" This refers to the fully-articulated display screen, and when it's closed, it protects the LCD screen from scratches or impact, and when closed for three minutes, it goes to standby, and the power turns off.Problem solved; another happy owner. Better solution: when you get the camera, RTFM... read the manual for a few minutes.\u25c6 [Update] 5/23/2013:Nikon has released two firmware updates for the P7700. Firmware update 1.1 was released on 4/23/2013, and firmware update 1.2 was released on 5/23/2013. I have posted the links and further info in the comments section to this review on this date as links are not permitted within the body of the review.\u25c6 [Update] 11/14/2013:Nikon has released a new firmware update 1.3 for the P7700. I have posted the links and further information in the comments section to this review on this date as links are not permitted within the body of the review.\u25c6 Summary:As an early purchaser of this camera, I've had time to run through most of the many functions that are available with this new model. There are too many of them to list here in my review, and I don't want to bore the reader with technical details, but there will be ongoing updates here and in the comments as new things are discovered.The new Nikon COOLPIX P7700 is the finest advanced enthusiast compact digital camera that I've used, though that can be considered highly subjective depending on the needs of the individual. Luckily for us, the quality of the equipment that is available to us in advanced digital compacts continues to improve, as I've noted with the outstanding Sony and Canon offerings noted above. Will admit that I can be picky with what I expect in a DSLR or advanced enthusiast's compact, but this new P7700 surprised me with the results that I've been able to get, and that's what it's all about. If your needs are similar to mine, then consider the P7700 to be an excellent camera. For this user, it's a true 5-star choice, and highly recommended.10/14/2012; Updated 10/20/2012, 5/23/2013, 11/14/2013.", "Date": "October 14, 2012"}, {"Title": "Electronic Wonder!", "Author": "Seldon Bradley", "ReviewID": "R1HZVHEU8TYK7I", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Finally, Nikon puts a major effort into the advanced pocketable (uh. .jacket pocket) camera market. Unless you need 7 layers of HDR or a long action stopping lens, the P7700 is all you need. Images are sharp, 16 x 20+ prints are well within it's capability. Low light performance is excellent as is the micro function. One of the major online reviewers states that this camera has no micro capabilities. I thought so too until I discovered that after selecting micro in the on screen menu you have to push the ok button on the rotary sensor.I purchased this at a local CS (price is the same everywhere for now) and compared it closely to the Canon G15 - which is the same price. Most obvious is the feel of the camera when you first pick it up. The last two digits of your hand curl around a grippy rubber covered projection on the right front of the body making it very secure in one hand - leaving the thumb and forefinger to manipulate the various adjustment dials. There is also a grippy flair out on the back - right where your thumb fits - thoughtful touch.  This design can only bring grief for lefties - but the dial layout is super convenient for the rest of us. For instance the +/- exposure control in auto mode is a rotary dial, right under the thumb - no lifting and fumbling with that annoying ring (never used it didja).Two rotary dials control manual exposure - thumb wheel on the back controls shutter speed and a wheel in front, under the forefinger, controls aperture. The screen stays bright throughout exposure manipulation - still looking for the stop down button. However, a sliding bar exposure meter is positioned below the on screen shutter and aperture info.While the G15 has a slightly larger screen, it abandons the articulating function. The P7700 swivels out, up, down, over and into position like a fixed screen. Flip it back and the screen is protected from damage by its solid back. However, the P7700 abandons the rangefinder. I thought I wanted one, but, the only time I have used it is when I have had to back up - head to wall and camera to eye - or when looking into the sun. The articulating screen solves these awkward shot situations.Internal memory - 86 MB - is small but will save some bacon when you forget to put the memcard back in. The stitching assistant gives you a ghost image of the prior exposure for easy alignment. Options include GPS and wifi, perhaps the most useful is the remote shutter release. Set up next to feeders and whack birds at close range!At this price point, the temptation is to move up to a camera with interchangeable lenses or a non-retracting lens. You will pay for increased versatility by limiting carryability. For a camera any larger the carrying options are either hanging the camera around your neck with a tourist strap or carrying a shoulder bag. The big advantage with the P7700 is that it fits neatly into a beltable or purseable bag. The camera is conveniently accessible and always with me - mowing with the tractor (deer in the sunset) or shooting candids at a friends wedding - while the big camera in the big case usually gets left behind.If you are emailing photos to friends and making 4x6 prints you don't need a camera with the capability of the P7700. If you want to walk around carrying a big camera so people will think you are a pro, buy a D3X. For the semi-pro photo hobbyist, seek no further.My only complaint is that the camera does not have winki eyelids - aaarg - a lens  cap,_ _ _ _ (buy a consonant).Last thought - this is not a sealed body camera and pockets have lint. My G12 retired from the field with a gerbil sized booger firmly attached to the back of the front lens element. But, I'm much happier with its replacement! All is well that ends well.", "Date": "October 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best small camera I have owned", "Author": "Michael M. Shaw", "ReviewID": "R39CFHQLYCA99P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned and enjoyed the Nikon CoolPix P7100, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX5W (and briefly, the LX7K; it had a de-centered lens so I sent it back for a refund).But this Nikon is something special.The 28-200 lens is faster than its predecessor and it seems to me that it is sharper as well. AF is somewhat faster and more reliable, too. The flip'n'twist 3.0 inch LCD to me is an upgrade and is a tad larger than the Canon G-12's 2.7 inch display, and it deploys with a little stiffer motion than the Canon. I thought I would miss the OVF but even in bright sun, the LCD is perfectly adequate.Raw files are much larger than the P7100's NRW files, so consider a faster, higher-capacity SD card to go with your new P7700.What will really strike you, though, are two things:1) the images are so much cleaner, less grainy and sharper than the P7100. Full zoom at 200mm effective still renders images that are sharp and contrasty.2) the feel of the camera is much more solid, substantial and \"pro-like\".This is a beautiful, must-have update on a camera that I really enjoyed before.In essence, the Nikon CoolPix P7700 is a solidly built, impressive camera that you will come to rely on, appreciate and carry anywhere.Just so you know, I did not buy the Nikon CoolPix P7700 from Amazon.com, so I did not experience any registration issues, though this has been resolved and buyers should have no registration concerns.EDIT: As of 10/30/2012,the Nikon CoolPix P7700 Amazon.com review rating of 4 stars still reflects the negative ratings given by buyers who were told by Nikon that they could not register their new camera. This is so unfortunate, as this was a (very) temporary glitch on Nikon's part and has no bearing on the P7700's quality or useability.As I make photos with the P7700 I am so impressed with the sharpness and detail in my photos and the professional and solid feel of the camera. I still believe this is the best small camera I have ever owned.", "Date": "October 5, 2012"}, {"Title": "First Impressions", "Author": "Scott", "ReviewID": "R1E4Q5K8LYN3VI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "My first nikon.  I have been using a 5dmkii since it came out and needed a pocket camera. Underwhelmed by G15 specs so bit the bullet and bought it.  first impressions:GOOD:*great image quality.

It's a good camera, but the high ISO performance was abismal. Bought the Sony RX100.  It's smaller, has better optics, is TRUELY pocketable, has built in panorama, and has great high ISO. Focus is instantaneous and I really like the lens ring.  Bottom line, the RX100 is better in just about every aspect except for focal length. If you need a 200mm, optional GPS or hot shoe, then  go with this camera otherwise the RX100 really is much better. I don't have a vested interest in either company as I've only owned Canons before this. I'm not some troll trying to start an argument for people who like Nikon, and to be honest, I never thought I would own a Sony. In the end, follow your heart :-)", "Date": "October 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Powerful Camera Small Package Real Surprise!!", "Author": "Jim Bolden Sr. \"Graphyfotoz\"", "ReviewID": "R3NJUC9BC87WGI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have had several different brand Cameras over the years....Sony.....Canon and Fuji.I won't get into a big sch-peel about the flaws in all of em but they were disappointing.Now this 7700 has been most impressive Camera I have bought by far!First thing that threw me off was the size....thought it was a tad bigger.But that wasn't a bad thing cuz it's really handy to carry anywhere.Very versatile with several shooting modes or full manual shooting if ya want.With all the most used settings setup with dials like high end DSLR's have is VERY nice!Got all the power and features of any DSLR I've ever seen cept changeable lens.The fully articulating 3in view screen is a HUGE plus and very handy.It doesn't have a eye level view finder but I never miss it.The fast f2.0-4.0 lens is unheard of in a prosumer Camera and noticeable right off.Takes amazingly clear photos in Night Landscape mode at ISO 1600 with very little noise!Battery life is excellent....construction is solid and not toy like....fits in hand nicely.This is the most impressive point and shoot/prosumer I have the pleasure of using so far.No Camera is perfect but Beginner or Pro you will love this Camera!I had considered the Canon G15 but review photo compare 7700 was a tad better.Also a much better zoom with high end glass with the f2.0-f4.0 speed sold me.I've been into digital photography since 2000 so I'm not new to all this.I have 25yrs of actual photography experience and consider the P7700 a must have.", "Date": "December 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon P7700 Initial Impressions", "Author": "S. Hock \"slhimages\"", "ReviewID": "R16YKFT7YMOW07", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "11/15/13 NOTE: There have been 3 firmware updates to date. Current version 1.3. Download from Nikon support.Many have already listed all the features. I won't bore you with a repeat and just give my initial \"out of the box\" impression. I'll come back in a few weeks with a \"User Report\".While looking the camera over I put the battery on to charge and checked out the PRINTED 32 page Quick Start Guide. I was very happy to see this cam has the smaller wall charger with the swing out prongs. No cord necessary to charge. (It took 1 hr. and 15 min. to charge.) I always found the cords an inconvenience on my DSLRs. I assume the full manual is on the included CD disk.The camera comes packaged nicely in its' original box with good packing and protection. Mine shipped from Amazon in just a slightly larger box and a tiny bit of bubble wrap. No real protection. It arrived without any damage.All the contents are wrapped individually ... very professional. Upon unwrapping the camera body my first thought was that it rather \"militaristic\" looking. The stark white letters on the knobs and wheels contrasting against what seems like a kind of matte black \"splatter\" type paint job that gives some tiny highlights, preventing it from looking pure black like my old black Nikon F did. The overall finish is very nice though, almost understated. It seems \"grippy\" enough to hold easily.Adjusting the knobs on TOP gave a sense of just about the right amount of detent hold, leaning a bit towards the too easy side. Any less and I would have been unhappy. It could make the cam be too easily adjusted inadvertently while carrying or placing in a protective case.The finger/thumb wheel adjusters (Command Wheels) on front and back have little resistance on my unit. I'd rather they had a bit more built in drag or resistance to give a feel that they are actually doing something.The various other buttons seem to have a good tactile feel when pressed. However, the adjusting wheel at the rear of the camera seems way too easy to move. This too could do with a bit more resistance.Some have complained about the physical size. Not me. This fits my medium sized man hands just fine. Too small is not good either. I found the Panasonic LX series a bit too small for my liking. If you want a really small cam, this isn't it. But, it's not all THAT large either. It seems just what I personally wanted. No, it wont fit easily into any standard sized pants or shirt pockets, but I'd never carry a camera of this quality there anyway!  It will fit comfortably in a coat or jacket pocket, photo vest pocket, or \"cargo\" type pockets of other garments.The lens cap that some have complained about seems to have enough spring in the clips that it won't be easily knocked off. The glass is .. well .. Nikon ED glass and looks great. If my unit works as well as the sample shots I've seen online I'll be very happy. I intend this to be my new all-round fun and vacation camera with a bit of occasional work thrown in.If I had to nit pick and not sound like a Nikon salesman, I'd say the ease of turning certain control dials and the less than robust battery door would be my only initial criticisms.The overall the manufacturing quality visually seems very good. It's nicely made and has a decent heft to it. It's no featherweight plastic toy but I wouldn't say it's heavy either. By no means does it feel cheap. To me it's what you would expect of a well made $400 Nikon camera.Though solidly built, it seems a rather precision instrument and should be treated accordingly for best life and results.After looking the manual over I realize this camera has quite a number of features that most reviewers have ignored. I suggest you download the manual and check it out before deciding what camera to purchase. You may be pleasantly surprised at all the great features this little camera has packed into it. I'm impressed with the thought and controls Nikon put into this one.Here is some first usage findings ...4/3/13 -  Any of you have slides you want to copy? I just discovered the \"FOOD\" scene mode allows me to photograph slides on my light table while giving me a 5 step color balance adjustment right on the viewing screen! Pretty neat! Works well and is quick and easy to do with plenty of resolution. Requires some cropping but is fine for online distribution.Reviewers I've seen have not mentioned that this camera has a \"sweep panorama mode\" like Sony. You can set at 180 degrees or a full 360 degrees. It takes some practice but it's doable. A nice surprise.The top control knobs for EV change and the six position Quik select knob for ISO, WB, QUAL, BRKT work very nicely. MUCH better than digging into menus & multiple screen levels (like my D5000). The EV + - change dial has an tiny orange light to warn you that you have changed from 0. Nice touch. If you know what to do with all the dials, you'll like them!I'm also finding the size VERY likeable. I wouldn't want it any smaller. When the lens is fully retracted it looks like a \"pancake\" lens, sticking out from the body 1/2 inch, slightly further than the grip.Anyone use the focus assist beam? This is the first camera I've ever had that the assist beam actually hits dead on the focus target. Both my D70 and D5000 miss by a small amount. Other small cams have suffered the same misalignment. Not this one.I'm really liking the rubbery grippy surface on the right front side too. Very non-slip.Still don't like the battery door latch. Seems like a weak link.4/11/13 - Another feature seldom mentioned is the \"intervalometer\" (time lapse) function that's built in. The timings are set a bit too wide for my use, 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes and 10 minutes, but may be good for some users. I would rather some user configurable timing set-up than being locked in to fixed times. It's not a feature that is used often but it's nice to have it available.This camera makes very good jpegs. From what I see RAW is not as significant an improvement as it is on my D5000. This is a good thing! I get tired of fiddling with RAW to get the best out of the D5000. With the P7700 I get nice sharp images straight out of the camera. The jpeg software seems to do little \"damage\" to the raw capture file. For a small sensor camera, the P7700 does a darn good job!I find myself sometimes wishing for a tad wider at 28mm and a tad longer at 200mm, but with this form factor I think this is about as good as it gets! Bulkier cams like the super-zooms can achieve wider zoom ranges but with a substantial size penalty. If you need a really wide or really long zoom you probably won't be satisfied with this camera. Other less versatile offerings may excel on either end of the zoom range, but Nikon has done a very good job of striking a \"happy medium\" with the P7700. It's certainly worth a look!No camera can be all things to all people. Choose the features, size, and image quality MOST IMPORTANT TO YOU and buy accordingly.5/22/13I was lucky enough to have the P7700 to take on a vacation to Hawaii. As a pro of 40 years I found all the dials and setting very useful and arranged in a pretty logical way. Imagewise the camera performs very well. Most of my images were extremely clear in JPEG format. I did not shoot RAW. On easy subjects the camera achieved focus quickly and accurately. On more challenging subjects, like whales and dolphins, things that move .. well ... not as good.Sometimes the camera does have a tough time achieving focus. That can be frustrating. Some subjects will require several tries to get good focus and of course then the moment is lost. If I were to wish for one thing better it would be an improvement on the focus system. Most of the time its is fine.I found the panorama mode works very nicely! As does the \"food\" mode. Hand held night shots did well too. If I would have had a tripod they would have been excellent. I found the low ISO 80 at f4.5 yields pretty outstanding sharpness provided you can hold steady.The camera size, tho some say is too big, I disagree...

This one may be best for advanced amateurs who can use the many features to advantage.See a few of my image samples in the listing.", "Date": "April 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good alternative to Sony DSC-RX100", "Author": "Matt Eye \"Matthew\"", "ReviewID": "R1LDYDBW73ASSJ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nikon P700 is similar to Sony DSC-RX100 in a few ways. First, do not let the 12MP, 1/1.7\" (10/17\") inch sensor deceive you. Its image quality at base ISO is identical to the 20MP, 1\" sensor on the RX100. Even at higher ISO settings, the quality is very close, maybe even a tad better. The photo quality is sharper on the Nikon, but the RAW processing on the Sony is better; the shadows/highlights are 'brighter' on the Sony's RAW, whereas the Nikon's are 'darker,' and this is a bane for low-light or exposure extremes on a sunny day; e.g., the sun challenging the exposure if you are at a 'wrong' angle. RAW photo quality is uncertain on the Nikon because my software cannot read that type of format, but the Sony's RAW format can be read with the software. (Talking about Adobe Photoshop.)Exposure control on the Nikon is great, making it much easier to stop up or down compared to the RX100. You can be confused with some of the dials; even I have. Assigning settings using the left dial (such as ISO) was frustrating to figure out. You cannot change the exposure during movie mode, but most cameras do not allow that, so this is a common limitation.Video quality, the Sony wins in this arena. Maybe because Sony's progressive format helps a great deal. However, the autofocus performance on the Nikon works better in any lighting conditions, well, maybe slower than the Sony in low-light. Fewer blurry images exist on the Nikon, partially due to the RX100's tendency to focus on the 'wrong' subject. NEX series cameras are the worst for focusing. They are only good for their photo and build quality. Otherwise, NEX cannot compare to a DSLR, like a Canon Rebel.As far as build quality, the Nikon is not quite up to par with the RX100, and is chunkier. What is nice about the Nikon is the screen swivels, but you cannot turn the camera on with the screen closed inwards (as you store it to prevent scratching the display). Close the screen inwards and the video you are recording will be saved, and the camera turns off. Another thing that is different, and where the Sony shines with the video mode, you have a dedicated movie button, unlike the Nikon. You cannot shoot stills with the Nikon; to take stills during movie, you can on Sony. With Nikon, you must switch the dial to movie mode; otherwise, only stills can be taken. I have a tendency to forget the camera is on video mode when intended to take a photo, but when on the photo mode, I do better remembering to switch to video mode. In some cases, the Nikon freezes (firmware issue, possibly). Even the RX100 can become stuck. After all, Sony and Nikon do share some of the hardware, at least for the sensor technology. Since Sony's sensors are used in Nikon products nowadays, the quality is expectedly superior over other cameras in their range. Except Fuji; you cannot compare the RX100 and P7700 with X-Pro 1, X100S, and anything else APS-C sensor size. Even if a Fuji had the 1/1.7\" or 1\" sensor, it would probably best the RX100 by a stop (X-Trans technology).Sony's lens is internal lens cover (like a spaceship's gateway in sci-fi movies), but you have a lens cap that cannot be fastened with a string to the Nikon. Sony's NEX cameras are that way too. At least for Panasonic DMC-LX7, you can get a third-party lens adapter, but removing the ring on the len's exterior frame is tricky to remove. You have to fudge around much to do this.All in all, the Nikon is good for people who want a swiveling screen, 12MP is good enough and sharper than most cameras - the P7700 has the best quality from a 1/1.7\" sensor, possibly rivaling some micro 4/3 systems. If you are into great stills and photos (less sharp for the photos but higher resolution), the Sony is a great choice. You do not have the hotshoe though.Just be careful not to buy the third-party spare batteries for the P7700. They have a tendency not to work properly, unless your patience to many a try pressing the power button and removing/inserting the battery. It is better to pay a little more for the authentic Nikon spare battery. Third-party batteries for the RX100 have not been a problem.Hope this helps.- Matt Eye, an avid \"professional\" camera user", "Date": "August 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Far better than expected!", "Author": "Raphael Schoonebeek", "ReviewID": "R1XN4SPSWSK8X8", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some background information. I don't consider myself to have a bias but most of my digital cameras have been Nikons. I have used many other brands through my work, Canon, Kodak, Sony and Olympus. I am aware that Nikon is not necessarily considered to be the best maker of small pocket cameras. So when I decided to upgrade my small carry around camera I thought maybe it was time to give the other brands a serious look. I live in a rural area and the nearest serious camera store is about 75 miles from home. So when it comes to purchasing a small carry around camera I usually rely on online reviews.As luck would have it I was visiting New Orleans and had the opportunity to check out all the cameras that I was considering at a local camera shop. At the time the Sony RX100 was at the top of my list with the Canon G15 next and the Nikon P7700 after that, (yet I was determined to shake the Nikon attachment that I seemed to have developed). The reason I decided to upgrade is that I wanted a small camera that had all the features I was used to in my DSLR, features that would allow for more controlled and predictable image results. The new crop of feature rich small cameras were said to have those qualities. I am aware the photo quality won't quite match that of a DSLR due to the small sensors, but I want to get as close as possible.So the cameras I checked out in the store were the Sony RX100, Canon G15, Fuji X20 and the Nikon P7700. They were all very nice. The Sony was very impressive, it was the smallest and could qualify as a pocket camera. The problem I had with it was the ergonomics, being so small and smooth without any finger grip, handling it felt like it could easily be dropped. The controls were recessed and smallish. I prefer dials that my fingers can easily feel without looking, and more importantly it cost considerably more than the others. For the record I am and average size person. The Fuji was very beautiful and felt well made the build quality and feel was very reminiscent of the old rangefinder cameras of the 50s and 60s. I did have some confusion over the controls of the Fuji (focusing), though it may have been me. The Canon felt the most familiar to me in that it operated much like the cameras that I have used in the past. It was somewhat similar to the Nikon but I preferred the solid feel of the Nikon to the G15. The Nikon felt great in my hand with a very nice \"sticky\"(rubberized) grip. Overall all these cameras worked reasonably quick, start-up, focus, shutter, write speeds, etc. I would give the Sony the slight edge it was quick and sure in all its functions, my seat of the pants assessment, I would rate the other three even. I'm not sure if I can rate the image quality from what saw on the LCD screens, my guess is it will have a lot to do with how the camera is setup and used, my gut feeling is to give the Sony a slight edge, the other three even.So obviously since I am reviewing here the camera I choose was the Nikon P7700. I had to go back and think of what my needs were and what each camera offered bearing in mind which camera put it all together at the price I was willing to pay. The other cameras were anywhere from $100. to $250. more than the Nikon. I preferred the Nikon's controls and menu arrangements they were all very familiar and comfortable. It is well built and I was surprised how well it stacked up to the other cameras. Many have complained about no optical finder I don't find this a problem especially in a carry around camera. I have been shooting so long that I am very confident and comfortable in shooting with either the LCD or no-look (I know what I'm aiming at), and if the framing is that critical to the photo I will be using a DSLR anyway. The articulating LCD is a nice addition (not essential but handy at times), the longer zoom proved to be a much bigger plus than I had anticipated. The three presets quickly get me setup to different situations and one or two changes if necessary and I'm ready to go. I like the easy access to the controls via controls/dials externally, I find clicking through LCD menus is slower and less intuitive. The results - surprisingly sharp and accurate, there are more than enough features to help me get the shot I see.Negatives? Well the write speed when bracketing in raw format is on the slow side. Three continuous raw frames takes a couple of seconds to write on a fast card. Not a problem for me as when I use this camera to shoot raw files I am generally in a more controlled situation where a few second are ok. I use jpegs for the more spontaneous shots and speed is no problem with jpegs. Some have complained about the removable lens cap, well I have dealt with removable caps for 48 years, one more camera with a removable lens cap is not a problem (and one less thing to break).The bottom line is everyone should decide how they use their cameras. Do you work fast and spontaneous or do you shoot set shots? Do you like sleek and small, fashionably retro, feature rich in the menus or external controls. Is having the latest \"best\" most important? Those are the questions that are most important when trying to match a camera to your needs. The difference isn't that great between these cameras, so the deciding factor should be how you want it all to work in your hands. Which led me back to the Nikon and after over 4000 shots this camera has met my hopes and exceeded my expectations.", "Date": "July 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "The true P7000 replacement!", "Author": "niXerKG", "ReviewID": "R1RTGHHETV3FCI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Some people may look at the specs and write this off as a junk camera but they'd be wrong.I will admit most of Nikon's Coolpix cameras are pretty crappy. Great for the casual shooter that doesn't know any better but the P-series has always been different. This is truly an advanced compact camera and one that I find really compliments my Nikon DSLR very well. I previously owned the P7000 and while that was a great camera, I had some complaints. Well Nikon apparently was listening and made the P7700 the perfect P7000 replacement!I realize there was a P7100 but it wasn't too different than the P7000 for me to really call it an upgrade.If you're coming from a P7000 then you'll be interested to know the big improvements they've made!1. SPEED. Everything is faster. From shooting to just browsing in the menu. There is no significant delay and depending on your SD card it's even faster at writing to the memory card.2. They finally added commander mode which means just like certain Nikon DSLRs you can use the pop-up flash to trigger your Nikon flashes via CLS.3. Speaking of the pop-up flash it won't pop-up on it's own anymore. Meaning instead of a silly button that would always get accidentally pressed when you put it in a bag or pocket, the P7700 now has a sliding switch.4. They changed the lens diameter to 40.5mm and to a cap system. Anyone that has owned a P7000 knows how annoying and easy it is for those silly lens doors to get bent in. I had that happen and the repair bill was a lovely $65 from APS (Authorized Photo Services). Thankfully the P7700 has a simple lens cap. It may be kind of annoying because it's easy to lose the cap but you can easily buy a small little cap leash or since the lens diameter is now 40.5mm you can buy a protective lens filter if you want.5. Removed the optical viewfinder. Now some people probably don't like this but I do. On a DSLR I absolutely need a optical viewfinder but on my P7000 I hardly if ever used it. It was tiny, distorted and was awkward holding it to my face. With the P7700's articulating screen it doesn't matter. It allows me to shoot any way I want and is just so much easier. For those complaining that they won't be able to see the LCD in sunlight, it's articulating... freaking move it to an angle you can.6. More manual controls. One thing I hated about the P7000 was the inability to change ISO or the metering mode from a dial like I can on my D3. Thankfully with the function keys on the P7700 you can now do that! This by far is the biggest improvement to me. Makes shooting so much easier and easier to go back and forth between this and my DSLR.7. It's built way more studier. Not that the P7000 was plastic fantastic but the P7700 feels like a brick of metal yet not as heavy as you might think. Just feels SOLID.8. No accidentally turning it on. One thing about the P7000 is you could accidentally turn it on in your pocket and possibly damage the lens. However the P7700 disables the power on button when the LCD screen is folded in.There are probably more improvements I can't remember but those are the ones that stood out to me.I do have one complaint. The articulating LCD screen. It looks great, the problem is with the articulation. This isn't a real huge problem and after you get use to it it becomes a non issue but when you flip out the LCD screen it can only rotate a certain way. It seems logical for the most part but if you rotate it the wrong way too aggressively I bet you could snap the screen right off. But like I said through continued use you get used to it. My only other complaint is the LCD screen is not glass, it's a screen similar to camcorders.So if you're thinking of upgrading from a P7000 don't hesitate, if you want a compact camera to compliment your DSLR then this is the one for you!", "Date": "December 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Just about exactly what I wanted", "Author": "Brian Haapanen", "ReviewID": "R2W7V53L0HORYZ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bet I'm not the only one looking for a high quality camera, smaller than a DSLR, but takes just as good a picture - eh? It was time to upgrade my D80 (purchased new in early 2005). I was thouroughly dissatisfied with the D80, however I was well versed in the camera - shot 20,000+ images with it; used most all functions from full auto to full manual; really was pushing the envelope with low light work in caved. My dissatisfaction was due to: (1) the errors in the White Balance - but if I shot RAW (which I did) I could fix in post-processing in ViewNX2 (I like that program, btw) (2) image clarity - it is more a function of my lenses, but I don't believe the body was helping me that much (3) for family travel I really wanted the ability to do video.Enter \"want smaller camera\". I travel alot. Both on business and with family; I can fit in photo-shooting just about anywhere I go, and for 'style' - it's \"travel/street/impromtu family\".  A smaller, less obvious camera is a bonus. Instant HD video is also a bonus.Quick summary of this camera:(1) Lot's of versatility. if you shoot a Nikon DSLR...and like it...you'll like the menus and setup of this camera. Just like it...in fact...more gizmo's than my old D80.(2) so many gizmo's...you can hang yourself on the gizmo-rope. Get familiar with the User Preset (U1, U2, U3). Some features are only available in those, not in 'P' or in 'A' or in 'S'. Wierd, but I'm used to it now.(3) Write speed when shoot RAW is way too slow. Ugh. I will be trying out faster memory cards (I'm using a 35MB/s 16GB SanDisk card...no slouch, but not the fastest) and it's about a 5sec delay between pictures. THAT IS MY MAJOR GRIPE. I hope to drop that to a sec or so?? If so - way better. We'll see.(4) Great White Balance, great 'everything' when shooting JPEG's....if that's what you do and don't care about RAW...then ignore #3.(5) Image quality: WOW. Better than the D80 with kit lenses. Seriously. With good technique, the images can be quite stunning. With bad technique...they suck. :) like any camera.(6) Speed...focus is pretty good - I caught it searching a few times. What's weird is, it did it in bright light more than dim, indoor light. I found low light performance excellent for any camera, but really nice for a compact!! power up time is very quick. I still hate hearing lenses zoom in and out, but I'm getting used to it.(7) Polarizer. I bought a nice B+W (I'm a little snobbish on those :) multicoated 40.5mm (that's the right size) circular polarizer and it worked very well on the camera. Autofocus may have been thrown a little  in bright light with it on, but I can't be sure. When I say 'thrown', I mean it was searching. When it did focus - it was tack on. It occurred randomly.(8) Video quality (when played back on a good device - like a modern \"smart\" TV) was EXCELLENT...in fact, I was blown away. Annoyances are: zoom noise...can be resolved with external mic; autofocus...very slow and sometimes doesn't 'catch up'. the less you zoom in (or change zoom, if you start recording zoomed tight) the better. Very handy - and I'm happy with it for casual family video's. Not going to produce any movies or broadcast quality vid's...but beats hauling a separate piece of gear.(9) Feel/function: LOVE IT...I went with the larger 'compact' form factor over the very small cameras, glad I did. I like a neck strap, but it's still small enough to go into cargo-shorts pockets.(10) the big CONTENTION. People gripe (me, formerly) about the lack of eye-level viewfinder, EVF or optical. I've always had one...until I got an iPhone (seriously?). So - after putting the P7700 up to my eye a few times out of habit, to take a quick shot, I started \"getting it\". Even in bright sunlight, I started enjoying the 'newness' of composing on a big screen. In fact - I'm going to say I've had an 'ah ha' moment. I really like composing on a big screen. I've got the grid turned on, the horizon gauge on...NEAT. So - as a reformed curmudgeon, \"props\" to Nikon for freeing my eye from the little hole. To all of you other curmudgeons out there...my 'ah ha' moment was when I realized that it's way better than looking at an upside down image on ground glass, on a 4x5 or 8x10 view camera!! Hah!!

Vogt", "ReviewID": "R4LI9TUCX0EJB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The P7700 is an excellent choice for an enthusiast compact. Especially if you're in the market for one with a longer lens.The camera has excellent image quality at lower ISOs thanks in part to its sharp F2-F4 28-200mm lens. If you are considering upgrading from the P7000 or P7100, I can easily say that there is a noticeable improvement in image quality over its predecessors. Color rendition is accurate. The camera has a slight tendency to overexpose but not as bad some others in this class that I have seen. And of course, you have your exposure compensation as a physical dial right on top of the camera so you can correct whatever exposure issues you have in a split second. The camera takes generally clean shots up to ISO400 with a little noise starting appear at ISO800 and even a little a more at ISO1600. But even at ISO1600, careful processing of the RAW files will give you some decent results.The camera is very comfortable to hold and shoot with. With all dials and buttons logically placed for easy access. The build quality is pretty good. The articulated LCD is sharp and works well even in bright sunlight (one oddity is that when the LCD is closed with the screen facing in towards the camera, the camera will not turn. You have to open up the LCD first in order to power the camera on). The battery life is excellent. It also of course, continues to offer a Neutral Density filter which can cut the light by 3 stops in bright conditions.Compared to other cameras in its class, the P7700 is kind of a porker. It's not very pocketable. Another thing to note is the addition of a lens cap on this model..annoying and unfortunate that they couldn't have used a built-in lens cover like the Canon G15 uses. As far the menu system goes, you have a quick menu accessible via a button on the left side of the camera which accesses the most commonly-used shooting settings and then the regular menu for everything else. It's not a bad setup but maybe not as intuitive as it could be.As far as performance goes, the camera is not the fastest around but it's not terrible either. It's autofocus system is reliable on locking on but can be a little sluggish in low light. In bright light it works pretty good. The write times to the SD card can be a little slow when shooting in RAW, so it's important to use a rather fast card (I use a Class 10 SanDisk)to help speed up the writing times. So this camera is not especially great for action shooting but none of the enthusiast compacts really are (except for maybe the Panasonic LX7).As far as video is concerned, I am primarily a still shooter so I don't do much video shooting. But I shot a short clip to test it out and the video looks pretty good. You don't have a lot of manual options though. So if you're a serious videographer, you might look at other models first.There are those folks that will say \"why should I buy this camera when I can get an APS-C or Micro 4/3rds camera at the same price?\". While there is some validity to that argument, you are not going to find a Micro 4/3rds or APS-C camera in this price range with a lens like this one has. It really boils down to whether you see yourself spending additional money on lens upgrades or not. And this point could be made for all enthusiast compacts, not just the P7700.Overall, the P7700 is a very nice camera. Its shooting performance is a little on the mediocre side but still decent enough to the point where it shouldn't be a detractor from buying this camera, it produces excellent image quality, has a great and very versatile lens, is comfortable to shoot with, and has excellent battery life. It's a great choice if you're considering an alternative to a DSLR and don't do a lot of critical low-light work, also for someone learning photography, and of course for pros looking for a light-weight back up.

I also owned the G12. Suffice to say I like cameras! Within this review I will compare it to the Canon G15 as these will be cross-shopped.Overview:Nikon has finally stepped up to create a good compact enthusiast camera. It's alone in the segment with a versatile 28-200mm lens and features a well laid-out array of manual controls.Build:The P7700 feels very well made with the exception of the battery door that feels a bit light-weight.Handling:Believe it or not, with it's twin command dials this camera handles better than a D5100 or D5200 in some respects. You get instant control over almost every setting via the dials mounted on top and front/rear. In this respect it's a better handling cam than the G15. The flip out display is as good as the one on my D800 and it's adjustable! Somehow Canon decided to remove their vary-angle LCD and revisit the 90's in a bad way. Since the LCD is the ONLY way to accurately compose a shot, Nikon pulls ahead. But not to be undone, Nikon then shoots themselves in the foot and excludes an optical viewfinder! Since Canon's optical viewfinder is missing camera info such as exposure and it's very inaccurate, I still prefer the Nikon overall in handling/usage.Optics:The P7700 28-200 Zoom lens is fairly impressive and perhaps the best in class. I found it sharper than the G15 and RX100 lenses and the 200mm is very useful. If you need wider than 28mm you should look at other offerings. Keep in mind that the 200mm end will not give you great amounts of subject isolation. Due to the size of the sensor you're still working in the F9 zone.Sensor:I'd say the P7700 is average for the class. I actually prefer the low ISO quality OVER the RX100 and G15, but at ISO 800 and above it's not as clean. Shooting RAW will regain some detail if you have good PP skills.Auto Focus:Some folks have has issues. Learn to use the AF illuminator and when NOT to use it. Learn about the 3 focus zones: AF, Close Range and Macro. I've had no issues using the P7700 in poor lighting, but it can hunt at the long end. Keep in mind that other cams don't even have the long end. Still, at 200mm I will generally get a AF lock 95% of the time. The G15 is just as good, but it's FASTER to lock and the overall AF experience is snappier.Speed:Shooting JPEG the P7700 is about average. But when you slip into RAW shooting the cam slows down. Using a Sandisk Extreme Pro 16gb card I will wait 1.5 seconds between raw shots. Shoot 6 continuous and the cam will lock you out for about 8 seconds. It's not awful, but other cams are quicker to process files. The G15 is faster here, though it's not a huge difference. But the G15 pulls ahead with buffering as it allows you to keep knocking out shot after shot with no wait times. The P7700 will knock out 8 FPS, but you'll wait after that for the buffer to clear.Flash:The on-board flash of the P7700 works very well, but an external flash will improve things quite a bit. Some users had had flash troubles and if you just put an SB400 or SB800 flash on so will you. The P7700 needs to be set for external flash and results are then excellent. The SB800 flash I own is MUCH bigger than the camera! An SB400 would make more sense, though you lose the flash' built in IR with that model. The higher flashes can also be triggered wirelessly for even better effect.Summary:The P7700 will be the best camera for you if you want/need the longer lens. 200mm makes for better portraits and can help in other shooting. It also has a great vari-angle LCD. I prefer this cam to the G15 and the RX100 because of the lens, but those are also EXCELLENT cameras. I'm using the P7700 as a walk-around casual use camera. I own pro gear for my work. For many a P7700 will be all they need. If you want shots of the kids and things that MOVE along with proper bokeh/subject isolation then a faster DSLR is worth buying along with a couple of lenses. For Nikon system owners the P7700 is a great add-on to your system. It works with Nikon flashes and IQ is impressive.

(The Canon and Sony units were such a disappointment in some of these areas).The P7700 performance does not disappoint either - tack sharp images at all zoom lengths, fast start-ups and pic to pic times, low noise, great color balance, and fast auto-focus except at very low light levels. Love the full manual control capabilities, plus the many direct access, frequently used, parameter selections without having to go through the Menu screens. All this, and it fits easily in jacket and pants pockets (sorry, not shirt pockets)!The only negative I have found so far (after about 3 months) is that the AF-L button needs to be held down while the shutter is released, otherwise the auto-focus still \"hunts\" when the shutter is finally pressed. But, I nit-pick. So far I consider it absolutely the best camera in its class and I couldn't recommend it more!!Ern", "Date": "July 2, 2013"}, {"Title": "Worth the $?", "Author": "Bear 57", "ReviewID": "RU4Z3T9A0QSI0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I will not write a long boring review when it comes to the P7700. I will admit that there is no shortage of good P&S; cameras available for reasonable prices. I have bought  several top-rated P&S; lately to complement my Nikon D7100 on vacation. This includes the  Nikon P7700, the Panasonic Lx7, and the Sony RX100. Here's the breakdown: The LX7 is an amazing little camera with a superior lens, takes excellent shots, packed with great features. Just a little too small for me. Runs around $380.00 The RX100 is also an amazing camera with awesome features and excellent shots, but again, is TINY, and too little for me. At $650.00, it is also much more expensive.The P7700 hits a nice balance. At $389, the P7700 offers awesome adjustments and features for a P&S.; The build quality is good, with a fine handgrip. Good flash, excellent features, and with a high-speed card is pretty snappy. Focus is also pretty quick and accurate.Where the P7700 excels is in the lens. Tack sharp from end to end, EXCELLENT Lens.Certainly not an DSLR, but at $389, can't expect it to be. But, images are excellent, and unless you are a pixel-peeper, it would take a mag. glass to see any difference in images from an entry-level DSLR.

I have a nikon D90 with intermediate lenses, and it makes beautiful  photos, I have control of all settings, fast, in my hands, no menus, a lot of specific buttons, in few seconds I can do whatever I need... As my D90, at P7700 you have specific buttons for speed, aperture, exposure, and 2 funcional buttons that you can set iso, flash exposure and other stuff...You have the navigation buttons with shortcut for focus mode, macro, flash mode...Even a button, on the left for a specific menu you can set with what is most important for you, and bkt control, iso, and a lot of just there, 2 click or 3 click away.......Never saw a compact camera (okay, p7700 is not compact, is a mid-size camera) that you can do that through specific buttons, without needing go into menu to set..Even entry levels DSLR or older bodies don't have all that functions, or just don't have it easy on your hand, and you can program even 3 user presets and a video mode you can control aperture, I thing this all is fantastic when you just remember it is a mid size camera, but definitely, designed for high end users that take control at most time! That was what nikon was thinking about, because if was for whom rarely uses those controls it could have all that controls, but under menu, like the new line nikon 1 J1,2 and V1,2...If you have to do that through menu, you will simply do auto settings at most time....that cannot be confusing, or you will miss shots...You can go under menu only if you got time to do all settings, on real world, it is rare....That's what I don't like on nikon 1 series...Even have interchangeable lenses on a compact body, I think Is limitation on lenses, and overall equipment will take much room as a tradicional DSLR...And in my opinion, I 'd rather control, of course, if the fixed lenses is good enough to do the job...There are few limitations, like you can't burst in raw, (but ou can do 8fps, that's pretty good) and overall, compared to my D90 it is a bit slow...the p7700 it's a pretty good camera who are used to shoot manual, or P, S, A modes, even on auto mode it can do work very good...There are few limitations when compared to DSLR, like speed, light, (depending lenses you are using), shooting in dark, noise control at high iso, BUT the p7700 will be my everyday camera, because I can put it in my bag, suitcase, or even hold in my hand or squeeze in my pocket (it will fit, but will not feel comfortable to walk around), so I am very happy, because I use my DSLR a lot, but use to have always a compact camera, just to register occasional pictures, parties, meetings and even when traveling (normally I travel with both), for the first time I have a mid size camera that I am fully satisfied with it, photo quality, video quality, and the freedom to work with it, capable to take good photos, without flash, or with built in flash, or external flash, or slave flash using the built in flash....About image quality? After all that, let's just say it is closer to a DSLR than a compact camera. blurry background, excellent colors, sharpening...And I don't believe that other brands on mid size, can do better or worst, just different...What nikon gives to you, will be a matter of taste, not exactly good or bad pictures!

The downloaded manual provide easy to find useful information on features and operation.  Among the many easy to find features is the night landscape selection which provides stunning results in low light situations and without a tri-pod.  I like the automatic panoramic setting also.  I have had no problems at all including warranty registration.  Regarding the lens cap...a simple stick-on tether is available which is easy to attach and keeps the lens cap safe.

Most powerfulcomponent is amazing lens - razor sharp wide or tele. It is a perfect balancebetween lens and sensor resolution abilities. Many cameras today squeeze in lots of pixels as a selling point, but coupled with poor lens can only be good for taking pics of mashed potatoes. Color reproduction is very realistic under different ambient light conditions. Built in flash is excellent. Everything is great until...Until you attach external flash to P7700 hot shoe. Now it really turns uglyin terms of color. White gets contaminated with some muted khaki/mocha color that causes other colors to shift. Skin tones are no longer natural and shadows on faces are rendered with rusty red hue. Don't try to fix it in Photoshop - color shift is no-linear and substantial. Also, it is impossible to re-adjust white balance on camera for external flash. I've tried three external Nikon flashes - SB400, SB800 and SB600. I have tested two P7700s -both represented same issue.  Hope Nikon will find cure and introduce it as a firmware update.P.S.If you use one of Nikon's external flash, I'd suggest to adjust Color temperature in White Balance to 5250K and save it to one of the User Settings Mode (U1, U2 or U3) so you can recall it any time when external flash is attached.

The camera is just a bit smaller, and lighter than the P7000, so that's a plus; however, I'm disappointed that I now have to use a lens cap on the lens rather than having it automatically close up.  I like to carry my camera in my purse, and now I'm worried that the cap will fall off and the lens will get scratched..that is my biggest \"con\" about this camera.

Why is this a big deal?  First, let me put things in perspective as to why is is a monumental moment in my life.  I bought my first SLR camera in the early 70's. It was a Ricoh film single lens reflex camera, which was quite a magnificent piece of equipment for the day. I used this camera for over 20 years, and shot my kid's photos with it, took it on vacation and photographed just about everything with it. Most importantly, I learned the fundamentals of photography by and became classically trained in exposure and lighting.  One of my favorite learning experiences was becoming familiar with Ansel Adams zone system. I slowing became a guru(and a bit of an SLR snob)  and could not see the benefits of using any other type of camera beneath the almighty SLR.  In the mid 90's, I purchased a much newer model SLR film camera, the Canon AE2.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven. There were so many upgrades to this camera that my Ricoh did not have. When digital SLR cameras became the norm, I purchased my first DSLR in 2003, the Olympus E-20. I began to upgrade my cameras every other year or so, because the digital cameras were updating their features at such an unprecedented rate, unheard of in film photography. From 2003 - 2013, I updated my cameras five times.  I now use the Canon 7D which has one of the fastest autofocus modes on the market.  So why did I recently choose to buy a point and shoot camera?There are so many reasons I purchased the Nikon Coolpix P7700 Point and Shoot camera.  To call it just \"a point and shoot camera\", is an under-statement. Although you cannot remove the lens, it has many of the same features (and more) of a DSLR camera. The Nikon Coolpix P7700 is really the coolest camera I have ever owned.  I would not have the time or space to mention everyone in this article, so I am going to list the five TOP reasons I like this camera.Reason #1 -  The Size My Canon 7D with the external battery pack and the 70-200 mm lens measures 13 inches and weighs 5 lbs.  Ouch!  No wonder I have arthritis in my neck and a pinched nerve in my right arm. The Nikon Coolpix P7700 measures just 3 inches and weighs only 1 lb. Its dimensions are 3x3.5x3 inches and can fit into my purse.Reason #2 -The Lens The Nikon Coolpix P7700 has  a 28-200mm zoom lens that opens up to f/2.0 and also serves as a macro lens if you prefer.  I am able to blur backgrounds by using a shallow depth of field just like I can with my Canon lenses. The macro feature is an added bonus because I do not have macro possibilities with my Canon equipment.  I can get as close as 0.8 inches to the subject.  I love to photograph flowers, so imagine the close-up work that I can do now.  The telephoto lens allows me to shoot from far away. Because the aperture is not fixed throughout the range of the zoom, at 200mm the widest aperture is 4.0, but that's okay.Reason #3 -  The Shooting Modes Wow, I can shoot in aperture and shutter priority or shoot in manual just like I can with my SLR camera.  Best of all, there is a dial on top of the camera where I can dial in 1, 2 or 3 stops of over-exposure or under-exposure. As an experienced photographer, I shoot many scenes with a slight over or under exposure, so this helps keep my keen vision in check.Reason  #4 -  The VideoI found this camera online because I was searching for a small camera that had video and a jack for an external mic.  There were not many choices, so I chose the Nikon Coolpix P7700. Little did I know that I would love all the other features just as much as the video. The camera shoots video in HD at 30 frames per second and can track motion with its AF--F autofocus mode.  This camera can support an external lavalier mic which produces much better sound than an in camera microphone.Reason #5  - The ISO RangeI am an ISO nerd and am constantly changing ISO on my camera to match the existing lighting, making sure it is not too high.  The Coolpix has and ISO range that starts at 80 and goes all the way up to 6400. Sure there will be noise with a high ISO, but the camera also has a noise reduction feature. Wait there's more. It has a built in neutral density filter that you can turn on or off. No more problems shooting wide open in the bright sunlight.There are so many other incredible features to the camera that deserve mentioning. Here they are:* Amazing software for downloading and retouching images* Shoots in raw in the Nikon NRW format.* Continuous shooting mode at 8fps.* Vari-angle 3-inch LCD screen.* Choice of pop-up flash, external flash unit, or wireless off-camera flash.* In camera effects like monochrome, sepia, zoom exposure, cross process, painterly effect and more.* Processes  HDR in camera when shooting a back-lit subject or a scene with a lot of dark and light areas.* Interval timer if you wanted to shoot a flower opening up or something that changes at regular intervals.* Histogram live view while you are taking the photo (can't live without my histogram)There are so many more features from its elaborate focusing system, to its white balance presets and bracketing to its custom picture control (available for video and stills) that make this camera incredible.But does the camera take great photos?  Yes it does!  I have taken a couple hundred photos, mostly of flowers in my garden and I am very pleased with the results. I have posted photos on my website:  http://www.online-digital-photography-course.com/Nikon-Coolpix.htmlI am especially pleased with the macro setting on the lens and the wide aperture setting of f/2 to create a blurry background.  I have taken a few indoor shots as well and am happy with the outcome. They are sharp and well-exposed. I have also tried the video using a wireless lavalier mic and the sound is perfect.  A car went by as we were recording outdoors and you couldn't even hear it on the playback.You are probably wondering if there are any cons to this camera. Not really a con, but I do not recommend this camera someone who typically shoots in auto mode.  There are just too many advanced features that would go to waste for a novice.  I purchased a book written by David Busch on how to use this camera and even for me I was stuck a couple times and had to re-read the material. The main con is the size of the image sensor. It is only 7.44x5.58 mm compared to 23.6 x 15.7 mm  for  a cropped  DSLR sensor or 36 x 24 mm for a full frame DSLR sensor. Image quality may lack for large images or those shot at high ISOs.  Will I be using the Coolpix for my professional photography? Probably not, but you bet I will be taking with me on my next vacation. Gotta run now...

Weisheit", "ReviewID": "RYB08KWNYAE80", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've long been a Nikon user and currently have the D7000 SLR.  As much as I like my D7000 and the 18-200 lens I use with it, there are times when I would like to travel lighter.  A friend suggested I try the P7700.  Wow - what a camera.  It has all of the features of my D7000 at a fraction of the size and weight.  The images from its 28-200 lens are sharp and the monitor, which is also sharp, can be articulated. It will fire my large flashes remotely and even has a few improvements on the D7000.  For example, it is possible to set the ISO to a specific level (as low as 80), but there is also a setting that allows the user to set a camera-determined range, such as 80-400. The lens opens to a wide f2.0.  There are lots of focus points and lots of options for setting focus.  Exposure compensation can be set with a dial at the top of the camera along with a small amber light that is illuminated when the compensation is adjusted - as a reminder to the user.  Although there are several features unique to the camera, most of the settings are situated in the same manner as in my D7000 and most don't require scrolling through a menu, but rely on buttons and wheels.  Speaking of wheels, there are two - one in the upper right front and the other in the upper right back, just as with the D7000 and they operate in the same way. It has a hot shoe for the flash, although I quickly found it a bit awkward mounting a SB-800 on the camera because the flash was larger than the camera!  I fixed that problem by buying the compact (and affordable) SB-400.  That flash and this camera make a great combination.  The camera has a solid professional feel.  It won't fit in your pocket but fits great in your hand.  And, quite frankly I wouldn't want something any smaller, and I certainly wouldn't want to give up other features to make it smaller.  I've only briefly experimented with the movie feature but was struck by the outstanding quality of footage I shot in quite low light.  For the most part I don't shoot video but it's nice to know it's there if I need it.  The in-camera vibration reduction seems to work quite well.  I was showing the camera to a friend and he was quite impressed and asked about the price.  When I told him he was amazed and said he thought a camera with those features would cost at least two thousand dollars (and might have not so long ago).  I think he's ordering one.So, what's not to like.  Well, there are few limitations, but for me the advantages that come with the compact size far outweigh the limitations -- at least for travel and for other occasions when I might not bring out the big guns.  However, they may be deal breakers for you. Here they are:- no optical viewfinder.  I thought I would miss this, but I don't.  It was in earlier models of the camera and added a lot of unnecessary space.- limits on the ISO. The photos are amazing up through ISO 400, but beginning at ISO 800 they begin to show some noise. On the bright side, ISO goes down to 80.- because there is no viewfinder everything is done on the monitor, and that eats up battery power.  The battery will supposedly last for about 300 shots, though I've not had a problem with it discharging quickly.  If you are expecting to take more than 200-300 shots at a time you should probably buy a back-up battery.- others have complained that the lens cap can pop off if the camera is bumped and yes, I have had that happen.  However, I wouldn't want a protective shutter because I do believe in protective filters on a lens and a shutter would make that impossible.  If the lens cap is your biggest problem then you have one heck of a camera!!!In summary, I absolutely love this camera.  It won't replace my SLR for weddings and other events, but for travel it's great.

The function buttons and overall layout of the camera are well thought out and easy to use. I have been pleased with the pictures, nice detail and speed that the CCD sensor was lacking. The in camera HDR (3 levels) works very well and can be shot handheld. The camera does have internal memory, but this is used up very fast, especially shooting RAW.

It doesn't take long to become comfortable with them given some hands-on time. Of course, mastering exactly what they all do will take a little longer.And I expect everyone will love the articulated screen, which is quite wonderful.I've had the camera for a week now and everything I've done with it has been most satisfying. Picture quality is excellent for both stills and movies, and the camera displays both stills and movies perfectly on my HDTV. (Requires an optional HDMI cable: standard Type A male connector to Type C male mini connector. Easy to find here on Amazon.)Of the five digital cameras I've owned in the last 12 years, this is easily my favorite. I consider it a steal at the $380 I paid for it.NOTE: The successor to this model - the P7800 - is now (late Sept, 2013) available. It costs a lot more at this point in time, $550 vs. $380, and its primary benefit seems to be the addition of an electronic viewfinder (EVF). An EVF isn't a bad thing to have, but I don't miss not having one. Also, the EVF makes the camera a little larger and you lose the Quick Menu Dial. My preference remains the P7700.Nikon CoolPix P7700 ControlsThe Buttons1. On/Off2. Shutter release3. Zoom in4. Zoom out (the zoom controls are on a single lever that acts as two buttons)5.

The 7600 was a fine, flexible, and conveniently small camera, and I took many beautiful photos with it; but the refresh time was long and battery life was relatively short; so when the P7700 was introduced in fall 2012, I decided then to buy one (after the post-Christmas price drop).  I could not be more happy with the new 7700.  It has the menu options of my older 7600 (which is the reason I chose it), and in addition has much of the flexibility of my old but beloved SLR, but without the weight.  Two days after the 7700 arrived, I took it to Mexico on a 2-week trip and already have some magazine-worthy shots, most taken with default settings.  As I learn the menu system and capabilities, I expect to take many more \"perfect\" shots and do much less editing.  Exposures in difficult indoor lighting situations (inside relatively dark churches, etc.) are well-optimized, with no effort on my part.  As I gain familiarity with menu options, I expect much more from this camera.  There are times, however, when I miss having an optical viewfinder, which I think would help me frame shots better in bright sun when the screen image gets washed out (I have mis-centered some shots, and cut off the tops of a few church spires because I couldn't see exactly where the top of the spire was).  I also bought a 58mm metal lens hood and a set of 58mm filters (and keep the UV filter on at all times to protect the lens and improve rendition), plus a handy 58mm squeeze lens cap, with a lanyard so the cap never gets lost.

However, as a part-time freelance professional photographer, I recently purchased this camera as a backup to my main system.  I simply hate lugging my main DSLR body and multiple prime lenses around, especially on family vacation, wilderness outings, or casual situations in which I may want to capture quality semi-serious or serious images but not lug around a loaded camera bag.  In short, I needed as many pro options I could get without the bulk and weight.  For totally casual shooting in which I do not really care about professional level quality, I rely on my Iphone since I always have it on me.  With the P7700, my main and heavy professional shooting system is now reserved for serious photo shoots.My first observation aside from the adjusted price point (off a high of $499) is that this camera is not a replacement for a pro DSLR body despite what anyone says.  Instead, I found it to be a fantastic supplement (with compromises) to my main DSLR system in that it offers a high degree of customization and manual shooting options similar to the pro DSLR's and a professional level output of images made possible through RAW files and post-processing.  The camera feels very good in the hand (it has a true hand grip) and is far better than point and shoot cameras below this price point but not as good as a within class camera as the Fuji x100s, which is far more expensive.  The camera is well balanced with external controls ergonomically placed.  Unlike the Canon G15, the P7700 camera has two customizable function buttons, one in front and one on top, that are easily accessible.  They can be configured in conjunction with the front and back dials, providing a high degree of non-menu driven customization, allowing the user to be much more responsive to changing circumstances.What will definitely appeal to pro-level shooters is the AF/AE-lock button next to the thumb rest (on back), with a large navigation dial for accessing the AF modes, flash, self-timer, and AF types.  This setup allowed me to easily transition from the customized setup of my D300s body, without skipping a beat.  Just know that non-pro level DSLR bodies, such as compact cameras including the P7700, are far more likely to be shared with a \"non-pro\" than more expensive pro-level cameras.  What does this mean?  If you customize the camera controls such as the AF (autofocus) control or shutter release priority, when you hand the camera to a friend or willing person to take your picture, chances are they will not know what to do; and, there is no simple over ride to restore camera settings to default.Pro's About the Nikon P7700 (from my perspective)\u261bPrice\u261bManual Controls easily Accessible (not menu driven)\u261bGood zoom focal length (28-200) w/good quality\u261bGood low light capability f/2.0-f/4.0\u261bSolid image stabilization\u261bDecent build quality\u261bFeels very good in the hand\u261bAutofocus works reasonably well for the class of camera\u261b0.8 inch closest focusing range\u261bFully functioning articulating screen (great for low level or overhead shots)\u261bUsable images to ISO 1200Cons About the Nikon P7700 (from my perspective)\u261bNo optical viewfinder (this really hurts)\u261bjpeg artifacts can show in images as low as ISO 200\u261bSpeed can be overly sluggish depending on available light/focal length\u261bSlightly bigger than comparable cameras such as G-15 (but- best texture, shape, and rear thumb grip).\u261bAutomatic white balance under artificial light was simply not good (easily corrected in post)In my opinion, the Nikon P7700 is \"best in class\" in consideration of features, build, and price.  I think it is best described as an advanced point and shoot camera with some performance flaws.  However, these performance flaws will be most noticeable to pro level shooters as opposed to point and shoot user's.  While I find this camera easily performs its intended limited scope application, I find that the absence a viewfinder really bothers me personally and will likely cause me to look for an alternative with an optical viewfinder.  However, most point and shoot users are already used to not having a viewfinder and will not miss this feature.Either way, at the current price point, I doubt too many people will be disappointed.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon Hits the Sweet Spot with the P7700", "Author": "d70sfan \"d70sfan\"", "ReviewID": "RRU5R4JWU9ISJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a long-time Nikon digital camera enthusiast (I've owned a D70s, a D200, and a D300), I've long had my eye out for a compact camera that offered the right combination of features and image quality to serve as a \"take anywhere/anytime\" substitute for the cumbersome DSLRs when I didn't feel like carrying the bodies and the accompanying heavy glass.  Too many compact cameras emphasize one feature (such as zoom) over another (such as lens speed or consistent image quality).  Until, that is, Nikon's latest \"P\"-series, the P7700, which - at least to this user - hits all the right notes.  For a landscape still photographer such as me, the P7700 offers many highly desirable features:* 12.2 megapixel CMOS sensor* Fast f/2-4 zoom lens* Wide 7.1x zoom lens equivalent to a 28-200 mm zoom* 3-inch articulated LCD @ 921,00 dot resolution* Shoots RAW (plus JPEG)* ISO 80-1600 (plus 3200-6400 in Hi modes)* Vibration Reduction image stabilization* Exposure Bracketing* 3 metering modes, including Nikon's excellent Matrix-Balanced metering* Programmable area focus selection* Standard 40.5 mm threaded lens* Multiple White Balance adjustments, with fine-tuning available* Convenient Quick Menu dial for commonly-accessed features such as ISO, WB, Bracketing, etc.Other helpful features include:* Multiple shooting options, including Aperture and Shutter priority, Program, fully Automatic, full Manual, numerous Scene modes, numerous Effects modes, and 3 User-defined modes* Programmable Function buttons (2)* Histogram Playback* Full 1080p Video* 4 Picture modes, with in-camera adjustments for image sharpening, contrast, and saturation* Capable pop-up flash (manually activated)* Hot shoe for external flashAll this and more in a durable package that weighs slightly under 14 ounces and measures less than 5\"x3\"x 2\".So what's missing?  Almost nothing, except - it should be noted - a viewfinder and a user manual.  Since I've shot with DSLRs exclusively before acquiring the P7700, I thought the lack of a viewfinder would be a hindrance.  To my surprise, it really hasn't been hard to get used to using the 3\" LCD screen for composition, particularly considering how bright the LCD happens to be.  The lack of a detailed physical manual is, however, a pain - all the more so because the camera is so feature-rich that the abbreviated Quick Start Guide just doesn't cut it.  My strong recommendation is that purchasers spend a few extra dollars and acquire David Busch's excellent \"Nikon Coolpix P7700 Guide to Digital Photography\" ($20) http://www.amazon.com/David-Buschs-Nikon-Digital-Photography/dp/1285459342As other reviewers have noted, the lens cap included with the camera has an annoying tendency to fall off; it's well worth protecting your investment with a much more functional replacement such as the Nikon LC-N40.5 Black Front Lens Cap, http://www.amazon.com/Nikon-LC-N40-5-Black-Front-NKD3608/dp/B005OMOUDM/It's also worth investing in at least a skylight filter to protect the lens, though purchasers may wish to acquire a set of filters (such as the Vivitar Series 1 set) that includes a skylight, circular polarizer, and neutral density filter www.amazon.com/Vivitar-3-Piece-Multi-Coated-Filter-40-5mm/dp/B005VDWFQI/Physically, the P7700's small size takes some getting used to, particularly if you have large hands like me.  When I first tried it out, I found that (holding it in my right hand) my right thumb seemed automatically to toggle the main selector dial.  After some initial adjustment, this did not prove to be a permanent problem.  In fact, the camera is well-designed for most users, with a comfortable rubberized finger/hand-grip that naturally fits the hand on the right side.Out-of-the-box use was easy:  Charge the (included) battery, insert an SD card, format the card, and shoot.  Images shot on full auto were sharp, in-focus, and nicely saturated, though a bit flat on an overcast day (fairly typical of Nikon in my experience).  Images taken using flash were tack-sharp and very pleasingly lit, with bright and very well saturated colors.In truth, I've only just begun exploring the huge number of features included with the camera, and will update this review from time to time.  So far, the physical attributes of the camera, including a good-sized CMOS sensor, highly capable fast 28-200 mm zoom, VR, bright 3 inch LCD, and best of all the capacity to shoot in RAW make Nikon's P7700 an absolutely first-rate \"substitute\" capable of producing superior images nearly on par with my much heavier and larger Nikon DSLRs.  If you are looking for a compact digital camera to augment your DSLRs, the P7700 should definitely be at the top of your list.UPDATED REVIEW, JULY, 2013:I've now had a chance to use the P-7700 extensively, having taken it with me as the sole camera on an Eastern European vacation.  The overall results more than bear out my earlier optimistic review.  In fact, the images from the trip are of sufficient quality such that I won't hesitate to travel with only the P-7700 again.  Because of the travel circumstances, I generally shot on full auto with occasional exposure adjustment as warranted.  Standard filter choice was a Hoya circular polarizer on nearly all shots.  Exposure -- auto white balance -- was generally bang on, with images nicely balanced and saturated except in the most extreme contrast situations.  I shot Nikon RAW and processed in Lightroom 5, with post-processing adjustments using NIK Viveza2.  Images were sharp and color was well-balanced.Three small drawbacks are worth noting, two of which are related to the absence of an optical viewfinder.  First, it can be difficult to determine the precise point of focus in high contrast situations using the LCD screen, so care is warranted in such situations.  Second, I found it difficult on occasion to determine the best contrast with the polarizer absent the viewfinder.  Again, a little extra care can make a big difference.  Third, the zoom lens \"locked up\" a few times.  I could neither find a cause nor replicate the situation, which usually was resolved either by depressing and releasing the shutter button or turning the camera off and back on.  For all I know, it may have had something to do with my right thumb hitting a dial at the wrong time.  Based on the overall quality of the vast majority of the images I captured, these are minor drawbacks that will no doubt diminish with additional experience with the camera.  Build quality is excellent, though the zoom \"lock-up\" bears watching.  I'd be interested if any other P-7700 owners have experienced the same event.Bottom Line:  This is an unusually full-featured camera in a very small package.  Image quality is excellent, shooting under real-world conditions.  For a \"prosumer\" like me, the P-7700 is all I could honestly wish for in a small digital camera.", "Date": "May 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "joanne", "ReviewID": "R2DKC4HQREASXN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Took this camera to a 10 day trip to Europe.

Then after that I was taking pics mostly with our phones...an HTC One X and Nokia Lumia 920. With a new baby I wanted to get something better to really capture those memories. I also tried a couple other cameras against this one: the Sony NEX-F3K/B 16.1 MP Compact System Camera with 18-55mm Lens (Black) and the Canon PowerShot G15 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom. The NEX-F3 is a mirrorless, interchangeable-lens camera with a huge APS-C sensor like those found on DSLRs. The Canon G15 is a direct competitor to the P7700. I took many shots of our baby with all 3 cameras in situations where most families would take pictures: living room with low incandescent light...sometimes television glow, bedroom with nightstand lights, etc.If you read most reviews, so much is made of sensor size, but what I found is that the P7700 pretty much blew away the competition for my needs. I don't know what kind of magic is in this lens, but shots of people have never looked so sharp. I only shoot in jpeg. That might change over time, but right now I want to make my adjustments in real time with the knobs and have great shots come right out of the camera. What the P7700 gave me, and what the G15 and NEX-F3 did not, was perfectly natural photos that just look beautiful.Now, the G15 really is a great point and shoot. To my eyes the G15's noise levels were only slightly worse than the P7700 at each ISO. It's more compact and doesn't need a lens cover, so I could see this being a great city camera. It's also a bit brighter for low light shooting, but the colors are just a touch too saturated and boosted for my taste. It would probably be an awesome camera for nature or city photography to make the images pop. However, I was not able to get quite as natural looking results of people in low light which is my primary use.The NEX F3 was quite frankly a mess shooting people indoors in low light. In either auto mode it would shoot at very high ISO due to its slower lens, and I got nothing but grainy shots on top of being over-saturated. I just did not like the color on the NEX one bit. Going into Program Auto if I dropped the ISO to the levels that the P7700 and G15 shoot at in auto modes, the images were darker and needed too much exposure compensation. I ended up fiddling with the settings so much I had no idea what to do next to get the result I wanted. The program modes of the P7700 and G15 give you the option to do Auto ISO with a max ISO setting. This allows you to tell the camera to auto pick the ISO but never go above, say, ISO 800.

Conner \"qm2-703\"", "ReviewID": "R3KZGJKZEBF28P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "================ ========================= ================= ========After trying the RX100, G15, XZ1 and XZ2, I picked up the Nikon P7700. At its price then of $359, as soon as I had it in my hands, I fell in love, and no longer \"just had to have a really small camera body\".Great lens, great flexibility, very accurate WB, great jpeg and very good raw.  The P7700 feels like a top-level camera, without being at all that heavy. Hung from the wide Nikon neck strap, this camera almost goes unnoticed during a full day of shooting.Add that the P7700 has an excellent tilt screen, top dials for most often used controls (WB, ISO, Metering, Bracketing, Exposure...), a standard hotshoe, and a very good built-in flash, with maybe the best exposure control of any built-in flash I've used. At $150 less than the RX100, it equals \"done deal\". One note here about built-in flash: I do not care for the off-color of built-in flash units, incl to a lesser extent this otherwise very well controlled P7700, so I still prefer the bounce flash technique.For RAW and continuous shooting, you should buy a high-end memory card. It is a small price to pay to get about a 30% improvement in real-world read/write speed. I've had good luck with Transcend UHS and Filemate Plus memory cards, which are also quite affordable. But a free trick is to turn off the REVIEW option in SETTINGS when you want to have quicker shot-to-shot performance. I get jpeg fines at 2 secs, and RAW at 3 seconds, from first shutter press to next focus lock.-------------------------------------------------------------------------A. Nikon P7700 shoots better quality ISO 800 than the Canon G16 for less money, but with admittedly a bit slower reaction. The G15,16 have fixed LCDs, not-so-great viewfinders. The P7700 has no viewfinder, but a very visible, full-flex LCD. The flex LCD is much better than any viewfinder when shooting from waist level or from overhead, which I do very often.B. Sony's RX100 has less noise at ISO 800 and 1600, but costs considerably more, and as I said, I prefer the larger, more balanced feel of the P7700 over the compact, heavy feel of the RX. The P7700 has more customization ability. The RX has better video, but not by that much for most family events....C. With the Oly XZ-2 I had intermittent focusing problems and almost constant indoor WB issues. Not as bad as with an XZ-1 indoors, but still below both the P7700 and the G15, which perform much better indoors.  Outdoors, it is a closer race, depending to a great extent on how saturated and warm you prefer your color.D. The P7700 zoom is usable out to its full 7X length, and okay even to 10-12X. That saves me from carrying a second zoom cam most of the time.E. A couple of advanced reviewers have mentioned the P7700 has visible noise above even ISO400... All I can say is that I don't agree until maybe 1250 in good light. You will encounter low light noise at 400. But the noise is the \"good\" kind, the kind that comes from less jpeg processing \"smear\", and is a lot easier to eliminate in post processing when shooting jpeg+RAW or RAW only. The sharp lens on the P7700 lets you get a good end product with minimal PP. I do wish for a bit better dynamic range, however.F. The P7700 has a great Auto mode for new owners of such an advanced camera, but it also has a very professional set of manual settings. This camera should fit several levels of hobbyists wanting to learn, and is still a useful tool for advanced photography buffs....If you own a DSLR and are in the market for a more carryable camera, I don't think you need an RX100, which as a weakness quickly rises in f value as you use its meager zoom. The tilt LCD convenience for above and below eye level shots, and the f2-4.0 lens are great advantages to a P7700.G. At my grandson's first birthday party, I got photos on the same quality exposure level as my daughter-in-laws' semi-pro friend with a Canon T4i DSLR and huge Tamron 28-75mm zoom lens. The P7700 even had actually better indoor white balance without flash.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION:This Nikon P7700 is a great \"everyday shot maker\", the one you grab when you're out the door in a hurry, without worrying if you will encounter cloudy, sunny, dawn, twilight, and all those other considerations. The only judgment needed in most cases is setting the mode dial or putting on a polarizing filter.This camera rates between 4.2 and 4.6, down a bit only for its processing speed vs some of the competition, and its capable but not remarkable video output.---note:Other cameras owned: A./ Sony NEX-5N (for clean Hi-ISO, great video, and still photography using old legacy lenses on adapters), and B./ Canon SX40 (mostly just for sporting events and for the sheer fun of a long zoom that has great jpeg color). These I consider as my \"niche\" cameras. With them and the P7700, I no longer own a DSLR and its 10 lbs of lenses - just not enough of an advantage to justify carrying a load like that. I'll leave the DSLR for the pros who need the so-called status in front of their customers..:))", "Date": "August 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great 2nd camera to DSLR", "Author": "Kristi Mann", "ReviewID": "R2YUGE51NAXZP2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Used on vacation.

Well it is a good rule until you start buying lenses and you need a backpack just to carry all your gear and in addition you never have the right lens on the camera for that split second unexpected photo opportunity. So, in order to comply with rule #1 after much research I purchased this Nikon P7700 to carry in my purse --- I have not been disappointed. Although I bought the camera because it can be used in full manual mode I admit to using the \"auto\" setting when I don't have time to \"think\" (don't tell my instructor). So far, the only bad pictures the camera has taken were 100% operator error.  This camera can do everything that my Nikon D3100 can do using comparable lenses. Obviously when I want to do serious macro or need my 300m lens for birds I'm getting the other camera but for basic, everyday stuff - including some low light (although when you need a tripod - you need a tripod), close up and even some macro this camera rocks.  The range for the telephoto is great. I thought I would miss my viewfinder, but I don't and with the movable screen I can put the camera low or over my head and still see what I'm shooting.  The camera isn't \"small\" it doesn't fit it into a pocket, but if you want a fully adjustable camera that can do it all pretty well it is worth the size.  2 thumbs up Nikon - it's a good camera!If I have a complaint it would be this - Nikon changed its RAW format and my Photoshop CS5 will not read the RAW files. After much internet searching I discovered that Adobe is not going to support the new file in the \"old\" Photoshop so I am stuck using the Nikon software or I can buy the new Lightroom and use it alongside my \"old\" Photoshop to edit the RAW files. I haven't figured out if I'm mad at Nikon for the change or mad at Adobe for their non-support.

After about twenty frustrating presses on the On/Off button, it did power up. After a few more shots, I powered it Off. I then tried to power it back up - but no dice. Despite many, many presses (and, yes, the LCD was opened and out - ready to go) it refused to Power On. It was dead.

It's not a DSLR, but short of that and cameras priced at twice as much, it's at the top of it's class and from what I've read, image wise, comparable to the Canon G15.  It works well in low light and the image stabilization works as advertised, allowing you to get some pretty interesting shots in light that was hitherto inadequate for taking pictures.Like most in it's class, including the G15...it's no focusing speed demon when using the image stabilization.  But I find, image wise, that it's more than worth the money...from 28mm to 200mm (35mm equivalent.)The cameras to watch for are the newer CMOS compacts with the DX sized sensors, which are, for now, out of my price range.Since the P7700 will accept screw on filters, buy a daylight or UV filter at the same time and as soon as you take the camera out of the box, attach the filter.  It will protect the front objective and allow you to aggressively clean the filter instead of the lens, should you need to do so.  And, with the filter in place, I no longer use the lens cap.  Just sayin'.Update: It's November 2013, and I'm still impressed.  No problems and still sharp as a tack.

The extended range makes this a very versatile camera for me. Its true I mostly shoot in the 28-85mm range but its nice to have the extra zoom for experimenting.I like the fact the camera can be set to step through common focal lengths such as 28, 35, 50, etc. What I dont like is that to do this you have to press down the Fn1 button while toggling the zoom lever. It is awkward to do with one hand holding the camera. Why not just have a setting to do it without the need for the Fn1 pressure.The build quality while solid, is slightly plastic feeling. Im comparing here to my Ricoh GXR which is like a metal brick, even the little Pentax Q feels more dense than this. I think others have overstated the build quality.I will say the rubber grip is fantastic on this camera and so is the movable screen at 920K resolution.I love the fact that in Manual mode there is a setting which allows the screen to darken or lighten to give you a live preview of what your exposure is. This is awesome for full manual shooting especially in high contrast shots where you have to compromise between blowing out your bright areas and losing detail in dark areas. This feature allows you to get a preview of how much you are blowing out or underexposing.The user interface while studded with controls has some quirks. What is excellent are the front and rear dials so you can control Aperture and Shutter speed in Manual mode. Great, just like a DSLR. As for adjusting exposure compensation there is the dial on the top right. I find it a bit awkward to move it, especially with one hand. On my Ricoh GXR I can assign it to the top and bottom buttons of the rear set of four. No having to grip the camera with both hands and twist the dial, just a simple press up and down.Annoyingly the Fn 2 button on the top near the shutter has only 4 options, virtual horizon, histograms, framing grid or ND filter. I use it for turning on the ND filter, you cannot assign functions such as ISO or metering to it. I know you can use the left quick menu dial dial for this but then that limits the use of it. Why this limitation?Lower down on the front right is the Fn1 button. I have assigned the combination of Fn 1 press and main dial to ISO, this is very useful but again not as easy as the Ricoh GXR where you can just press the Adj lever left and right for instant control of ISO. You have to feel around the front blindly to find the Fn1 button and then try to spin the dials at the same time Its a bit awkward to do with one hand so you need to steady the camera with the other hand. I have set the combination or Fn1 and rotary selector dial to metering which is useful.One thing I like is that in playback mode you can delete photos with a double press of the delete button. This is a great timesaver as many other cameras require you to press delete then move a cursor to \"yes\" with the rotary selector and then press \"OK\". When you are deleting a whole lot of photos this becomes very tedious. I will say though the p7700 has a noticeable processor lag so if you double press too quickly the camera does not register your press and you have to do it again.The rotary selector dial rightmost press controls AF area mode and can only be turned on and off, there is no customisation.The quick menu dial is a bit dumb because you have to rotate it first through a limited choice of parameters, then press the button on the dial to go to the options for the parameter, then use rotary selector dial to move a cursor to your setting then rotate the dial then press yes. Why not just have a button which takes you so a full rear screen of parameters set out in a matrix table like the Fuji \"Q\" button, then you use the buttons to move up and down left and right to go to the parameter and then spin the rotary dial to change the parameter. It doesnt add anything to have the dial.OK I have been a little harsh on this camera, but little things like this are what makes the difference in your fluid experience of shooting. I still bought this camera and have given it 4 stars because frankly every camera I own seems to have similar ergonomic faults which are not thought through. I will say though the Ricoh GXR still beats them all for ergonomics and considered getting the p10 with 28-300 zoom instead of this. However the p7700 trumps the p10 for sensor size and image quality. Its all about compromises and what you may gain in one camera you lose in another", "Date": "November 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great camera!", "Author": "Lisa", "ReviewID": "R3PNQ6663VSV2H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It was my birthday present.

I'll update this review after I've had some more time with this superb camera.After several weeks of owning this camera, I would give it 10 stars if I could. It's everything that I wanted in a camera of this type and even more. I'm sure that I've taken well over a thousand images so far and I'm continually astounded by the quality of images that I'm getting. The combination of the Nikkor lens and BSI-CMOS sensor deliver a degree of photographic subtlety that I would never have expected from a camera at this price range.

I'm dinging my review slightly for the lack of a scratch resistant surface on that screen. I got this to replace the Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS5 (black, serial #FM0CA015097) that was stolen from me as a photojournalist in an assault-robbery by a group of (A)narchists at The Evergreen State College (TESC) in Olympia on 4-20-13. If you run across this stolen camera in Craiglist, et al, or have info regarding it, please contact the owner at amicuscuria.com/wordpress. The sensor is larger (1/1.7\" vs 1/2.33\") and a CMOS instead of a CCD. The CCD generated richer colors and fewer over exposures. The telephoto feature is less powerful (7x vs 12x optical) but the lens is faster (2.0 vs. 3.3).The P7700 is more fully featured, especially with respect to video capabilities, et ux. It genuinely does well in much lower light than the Lumix ZS5. It also has a standard hot shoe which the ZS5 did not. The popup flash on the P7700 seems well constructed, not too flimsy, reasonably straight forward to use, though, as might be expected, not the equivalent of an external flash. The color saturation isn't quite as rich as the ZS5, but the image quality is on a par with the Leica lens in the Lumix. Nikon touts this is the best lens they've ever included in their P&S; lineup. It has AF, including in video mode. One must be careful how the unit is held with the left hand else the button-dial on the left top (near the popup flash) will be triggered, interrupting the flow of shots.The P7700 has time lapse and higher resolution video capability than the ZS5. Neither has AVCHD video format, though this can be had in the pricier (if you can still find a new one) ZS9. The Nikon does, however, create a .MOV video envelope as does the ZS5. This is helpful when editing videos in post production. While the 7x zoom isn't as long, its lens speed is welcome and the camera encourages the photographer to get closer to the subject, a better strategy for quality photos which helps diminish the problem of camera shake. The P7700 comes with an anti-shake feature built-in which works reasonably well. In intelligent mode and bright light, some shots can too easily look washed out/overexposed in 'intelligent' mode, but it does very well in the shadows/shade. I'm not certain it's dynamic range and ISO capabilities are top notch, though it has an HDR feature.This unit is slightly too large to hold in one hand secured by a wrist strap. It's better suited to hang from a strap around your neck. The articulated LV screen can make it suitable to hold over your head in a press scrum. It has an HDMI output and a stereo input jack for an external microphone. The internal microphone is decent enough and not too sensitive to wind rumble. The image buffer (shot-to-shot) is a tad slow to empty, creating what feels like shutter lag when taking successive shots. This drawback is less than ideal for fast breaking news events. On the other hand, the camera is less obtrusive due to its diminutive size. The zoom feature during video isn't as smooth as the ZS5, or as quiet.Though I'd have liked an APS-C sized sensor with a few more mega-pixels, this is an excellent camera for the money which you'll enjoy as much as I do. It's small enough to wear in a small zip-up camera pouch on your belt. You should purchase a couple of extra batteries (their capacity is somewhat small) for it along with a 32G Sandisk class 10 (or better) SDHC memory card. The P7700 comes with an LED AF assist for dark interiors/night shots. It has a full compliment of manual features, is easy to use though the menus can be scattered between the various dials. You'll want to purchase a metal lens cap to thread over the lens for protection as the plastic one sux. You can add a 40.5mm CPL without interfering with how the zoom functions. It comes with a printed manual. If you can only bring/own one camera, especially for interior or poorly lit events, this is the one.My biggest (but limited) disappointment with this camera is the lack of hardened glass protection for the LV screen and an APS-C sized CCD sensor. My biggest thrill with this unit is how it performs in the shade and low light conditions along with the image quality. The quality lens has much to do with the IQ. The ISO, not so much. Possibly there's a trade-off in the manufacturer opting for the less expensive CMOS sensor over a CCD sensor: Though the CMOS doesn't seem to have the color saturation (this can be adjusted, however) and dynamic range, it likely runs cooler in video mode than the CCD would. This means you can shoot more video without the risk of overheating the unit.", "Date": "May 12, 2013"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "Pam Marquis", "ReviewID": "R320R9DPCJ5DFP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "For a novice this is the camera for you.

New firmware not cool :(", "Author": "S. Adams \"S. Adams\"", "ReviewID": "RKVGA508PWG0Z", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I originally bought this camera at the same time as the Canon G15, in order to try both out, compare them, and choose one to keep for my own use. As it turned out, I had not yet made my final decision, but was leaning towards the Canon because of its faster speeds and somewhat sharper pics and better overall performance, when my husband stepped in and commandeered the Nikon. I was a little nonplussed by his move because there were a couple of features on this camera that surpassed the Canon and I was still on the fence about it. I very much like the vari-angle LCD on the Nikon, as well as the much farther reach of the zoom.However, after owning and using both cameras since the beginning of April, I have to say that I am much happier with the Canon. And not so much just because of the advantages described above, but more because we have also had the dubious \"opportunity\" to compare the warranty service levels available to both cameras. And also, in no small way, because our Nikon is now systematically sucking dust into its layers of lenses. Yes, I said \"into\".Here is the whole story of what happened with both cameras: A few months ago, after having taken a total of about 11,000 pics with the Canon, it started jamming up. I called Canon, explained the symptoms and was immediately (within less than half an hour) emailed the documentation I needed to fill out and a prepaid UPS label and instructions on how and where to send the camera back and how long it would take to repair and return it. All this was done exactly as described, and I didn't have to pay a penny out of my pocket. The camera arrived back within the appointed timeframe, functioning perfectly. However, when I got it back, I noticed a very tiny nick in the paint on the removable neck ring around the base of the lens barrel.  I called and asked Canon to replace it, letting them know that my camera had been returned to them in 'like new' condition, so it had obviously been nicked while in their care. The person I reported this to, asked me to hold while he asked a supervisor how to proceed with this. The supervisor came on the line and recommended I send the camera back so they could check it through again, to make sure that whatever had caused the nick had not further damaged the camera somehow - as in a drop or jar of the camera. I was pretty sure that was not the case, but agreed to send it back and let them look it over just the same. I told them I was a bit upset at having to be without my camera for several more days again. They told me they would expedite things for the second round, so I wouldn't have to wait as long this time. They made good on that promise by sending me a UPS Overnight label to pick up the camera. They kept it for just a few days, but sent it back via UPS Ground Service, which was a bit of a letdown.In contrast, when Nikon was called about the dust and bits of grass in the lens problem the first time, a couple of months ago, it took them a couple of days to send over the paperwork to fill out. Neither the paperwork nor their email contained any information about how long the repairs might take, and we also had to ship the camera back to them at our own expense. Not a huge expense, admittedly, but still a contrast to Canon's better efforts to keep customers happy.Now, less than two months after getting the camera back, there are dust particles in the lens again. We live in Vermont and my husband uses the camera for street photography here and in Montreal. These places are not exactly known for being dust bowls... So, in effect, the camera has not been subjected to any unusual conditions. Yet the seals are clearly not doing their job because the camera is sucking foreign particles into its lens system at several different levels of the optics.We reported the problem to Nikon last Friday, early afternoon, and they sent a preliminary email acknowledging that they have received our communication. Once again though, here it is Monday and we are still waiting for the necessary paperwork to be sent, so we can return the camera (at our expense again, even though it's the same problem they were supposed to have fixed last time and the camera is still under warranty...) and hopefully get it back before Christmas. A hope that was communicated to the Nikon rep when we called in to report this reoccurrence of the problem last Friday.I would have given this camera a 4 star rating, had it not been for the contrast in the service level with the Canon people and, of course, the unacceptable seals that allow dust to be sucked into the optics of our camera. I have not seen any other people complaining about this problem, so I am assuming it is unique to our own camera. Once this problem is corrected to our satisfaction, I will update my review and the star rating too.UPDATE: Nikon took the camera and did pay for the shipping this time, when we asked (Canon does it without asking, every time). They did not get the camera back to us before Christmas.  When they returned the camera to us the first time, the camera started having issues with accepting third party batteries. Since they returned it this time, it has not been accepting third party batteries at all. Clearly, they have upgraded to their new firmware, which locks out third party batteries for not only this camera, but all Nikon cameras that use the EN-EL14 batteries. There is more info about this on the web. I will include a link in the comments section about this.Aside from our 4 back-up batteries now not working in our camera, it is also behaving extremely erratically. It has been on one photo shoot so far. Took over 300 pics. Had several strange things happen. The camera stopped taking pics at one point. LCD working fine, button depressing, but no pic. Tried again, display info disappeared, still no pic. LCD showing the scene, but display info gone, button depressing properly, but the camera is not recording the shots. Camera will not turn off. Had to remove the battery to turn it off. After that, it started working again. When the pics were downloaded, several overlapped, some vertically (kind of looked like a film camera's pics would if you didn't wind the film properly all the way to the next frame), some horizontally, creating a weird, half 'n half effect. One picture showed up with a severe white balance issue. It was in a deep blue hue. The camera was being used in AWB the whole time.We have some more experimenting to do with the pictures. We will load them onto a different computer, with a different program and see what we find. We will also be scrolling through the images directly on the SD card. Will report back when we have more info.", "Date": "December 9, 2013"}, {"Title": "Cheap feeling body, no viewfinder, brother can you spare a lens cap . . . ?", "Author": "Robert W.

It feels cheap, especially considering its list price is $500 (I paid $430).* The lack of a viewfinder is a major problem. The LCD screen is very difficult to see in sunlight. I find I have to adjust the screen to keep it shady. Then I have to contort myself to see through it. Canon's now discontinued G12 had probably the best solution: a viewfinder and the articulating screen. The new G15 keeps the viewfinder, but eliminated the articulating screen. That cost Canon a sale.* I almost lost the lens cap the first night I used the 7700. About the size of a silver dollar, it needs some kind of tether. Otherwise, it's gone. Replacements from Nikon's website cost $13 ($7 from Amazon). I hope they didn't give the guy at Nikon a raise for figuring out how to boost lens cap sales.* Buy a daylight and/or a polarizing filter and keep it on the camera at all times. Otherwise plan on a scratched objective lens.* The image quality is typically very good. But I like my well-traveled D70S better.* Having used a friend's Canon G12, I'd say it's a better camera. Better build, better quality body and optics of the same quality.

You might want to read my review below.I have had and used this Nikon P7700 for about a few months now. The camera is a great little camera.  However, Nikon has failed to implement the manual focus correctly in M mode.  It's so simple for Nikon to do it correctly and I hope that they will address the problem in a firmware update soon, please.Let me describe the problem:1. set the camera to manual (M) mode2. set the focus mode to manual (MF)At this point you can do manual focus using the big dial on the back of the camera.  You press the dial to the right to initiate a \"mini\" auto focus.  Press the dial up to focus farther and down to focus closer.  And turn the dial to fine tune your focus.  However, the magnified focus point IS locked to the center of the frame and there is NO way to move the magnified focus point.  This IS a big disappointment; it makes manual focus mode virtually useless.  We need to able to move the magnified focus point off center.  You can still focus things that are off center in the frame BUT it's very hard to tell whether things are in focus or not on the screen.  If we could move the magnified focus point to the area we need to focus, it will make the camera very very good.The focus point can be moved in the P, S, and A modes.  According to the manual, on pages 47 and 48, moving the focusing point should work in P, S, A, and M modes.  So maybe Nikon had intended this to work also in M mode but some how there is a bug in the firmware that prevents it to work.  It seems that Nikon ran out of buttons/dial for moving the magnified focus point in M mode using manul focus (MF).  But may I suggest the following.I would like Nikon to implement the move of the magnified focus point in a firmware this way:Press Fn1/Fn2 and use the big dial for moving the magnified areaI hope Nikon reads this review.2013/01/03Let me first say that I'd like to use the camera for focus stacking.I'd like to make a little clarification to make sure that people reading my review will not be confused.  The enlarged focusing area can't be moved on in manual focusing (MF) mode; it's locked in the center of the frame/screen.  However in auto focus (AF) mode, you have the option to manually place the focusing area.  But the AF fails to lock onto smooth shinny area of a subject most time.  And the AF also fails to lock onto the edge of the subject; it will either locks onto the background or a part farther from the edge because the focus point is too big.We need to ability to move the enlarged focusing area to another spot on a subject.  The focus/recompose method does not work for focus stacking.  Finally, the enlarged focusing area sometimes blocks the very spot that you need to focus on!Please, Nikon provide the ability to move the enlarged focus area in MF in a firmware update.Thanks.", "Date": "December 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Overall a great camera", "Author": "Jesse", "ReviewID": "R1C3GVBIRHSQ5Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I've been using this camera for several months now and I must say, this thing has every feature I could ask for.

I have been on the Photography business for more than 30 years and for the last 20 I have been a Canon user.  However, recently I have been so impressed with the newer range of Nikon DSLR's and lenses that I decided to liquidate my considerable collection of Canon equipment and buy all new Nikon gear with the D600 as my main body.I really wanted a good point-and-shoot just for daily use and to round out my kit.  I chose the P7700 as it is the latest and greatest and most closely resembles the style of the Canon G9 which I liked very much.Anyway, long-story-short  . . . . . I have been very disappointed with this camera and frankly I feel it's a step backwards.  Here's why:1. The rotating screen is an OK feature, but frankly it would rarely be used and as a result I tend to always keep the camera with the screen folded flat against the camera back, facing out and always ready to go, just like most other compact digitals these days.  The downside of this is the screen will get thrashed very quickly as it's an older style material and frankly should not be left uncovered.  It should have been made with a more durable glass to protect it when left like this.2. The camera will not even switch on if the screen is not rotated outwards, which makes sense, but adds a layer of things to do in order to set up to take pictures, which ultimately removes a lot of the spontaneity of a point-and-shoot.3. There is no \"Instant Record\" video button anywhere on this camera, and requires you to switch from photo taking mode to video mode by rotating the function dial on top of the camera.  This can take several precious seconds and again is a major spontaneity killer, rendering the point-and-shoot usefulness of this camera almost worthless.4. The built-in flash is decent but I am absolutely mystified as to why the people at Nikon would think that it's OK to force the user to physically press a switch to pop the flash up whenever you want to use it.  I can't tell you how many shots I've missed because I forgot to pop the flash up before I started shooting. Very annoying!  Obviously the intent is that you pop the flash up before you start shooting and leave it up the entire time you shoot in case it's needed.  OK, fine, but once again, too much to think about and another spontaneity killer.  The flash should always come-on, on its own whenever needed, especially in full-auto mode.5. Ergonomics  . . . . . quite frankly, awful.  There is simply too much going on with this camera.  There are knobs, buttons and dials all over the place and it is practically impossible to pick it up without pressing a button or turning a dial thus changing a setting.  Most of the buttons and dials could be eliminated and all these settings incorporated into the menus, which most of them are anyway so they're basically redundant.  I constantly have to check and re-check my settings to make sure I didn't accidentally change something that would mess up my shots.6. Lens cap . . . .  A total waste of time and as others have said can be easily lost.  I bought a UV filter and ditched the cap altogether.Bottom line is this camera is really not a point-and-shoot.  Nikon has tried to cram all the features of a DSLR into a compact camera and turned it into a small package that's actually very difficult and cumbersome to use.  There is simply too much going on and too much to keep remembering all the time to make it a fun camera to use.  The average owner will never use even a quarter of the features and will be intimidated to even try.On the plus side, the construction is very nice, and the lens is excellent (great image quality).I'm probably going to be returning this camera and look at the Sony, which is a real shame because I had such high expectations from it.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice.", "Author": "YALILE", "ReviewID": "R2X6SVOU0NT7U7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera is a good product, but the canon versi\u00f3n is still the best.It has a good size and shape.", "Date": "May 27, 2013"}, {"Title": "If you're looking for a compliment to your dSLR, it's not this camera.", "Author": "Anthony Casabianca", "ReviewID": "R1J1UF1XVX14MY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great point and shoot but really nothing more.
