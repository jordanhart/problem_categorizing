{"Reviews": [{"Title": "wansview IR outdoor camera", "Author": "stumpedI", "ReviewID": "RH9LV3YM9U6R2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Software is very basic, a shame when with so little effort they could have made this much better.  Also when going wireless nothing indicates pass or fail to connect.. other than actually connecting. there is no failure notice.. it just sits there.  The only indication you successfully connect is when u connect.  The 5v power cord is not very long.  It is the only limitation on where or how far you can put the camera.  I can see clearly at least 50 feet in pitch blackness.  The LED lights ARE visible in the dark.  So this is not a covert device.  There are two stages to setting this up (other than installation) .. first you hook it up to  a wired LAN.  This stage must be done with the computer your using for the set up .. connected to the same router as the camera.  Here you verify camera operation, set up network parameters and can probably set up passwords.  The documentation is minimal.  When you put in the installation cd.. choose the file for your camera type.. you get a menu with a few options.  to use IE you also have to install a special player with more camera options and controls.  other browsers have very few options for camera control.  The weak spot with this camera was the instructions that come with it.  and even worse .. the software to operate it. otherwise this product would have gotten 5's.  A very rough guess on the camera's view angle would be somewhere around 70 degree's field of view. (five of these camera's back to back would give ~360 view).. that's a rough estimation.. This camera is also fixed position. no electronic moving without external capability.  camera views are tiny  small  and medium views.  Once this is set up you can view it from anywhere there is a internet connected computer.  there is motion detect but no documentation on what the settings mean.  (is a 1 or a 10 more sensitive?).. very weak documentation.  much of the controls are greyed out.. like where to save video's when alarms are triggered... again no documentation.. amateurish software... it is bewildering that the company does not invest in this aspect.  a useful product could become a great fantastic product.. simply by writing  a decent manual and providing a professional full featured software to go with it.  (they only have to do this ONCE. then ship it with ALL the camera's.  it is not like they have to write a manual for each one!)  One last note is i saw warnings from others about 1 lifetime review 5 stars.. ie fake reviews on other products.. I bought this specifically because the other model had 1 review reviews with 5 stars.. ie people are trying to contaminate the rating system to sell their product.  I wont buy a product where all the 5 stars are one time reviews and all the neg comments are regular shoppers/reviewers.  Amazon should look into that.  This camera works.. it does it's job. 4 stars.  would have got 5 stars if it's software and manual were as good as the camera.", "Date": "July 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Five star product on quality, value, and performance.", "Author": "buknoy", "ReviewID": "R2ON12PAPE3YQU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I like this camera.  For 60 bucks, I got a great product that works advertised.Setting up the camera is another story, and I cannot fault the manufacturer some of the other faults that reviewers have found with it due to my individual needs and lack of experience with streaming video, especially over a wireless network.I had learned many things about streaming video in trying to get this to work for me, as I have made many mistakes in the process:This is not a wireless-n camera.  Don't expect to get the same speeds, range, (and smooth video), as with other N-type peripherals.  In fact, having B or G devices on the same SSID with your N network would slow your N network down.Having setup 2 cameras wirelessly, I would recommend having a separate type B-G router on a different subnet on a different wireless network so as not to overload your solo router which serves your web browsers, or netflix, or gaming machines.  Most routers by default give preference to video network traffic and your wireless camera will demand a good deal of bandwidth for smooth 640x480 video w/sound, around 800kb/sec for me.  In my case 2 of these cams would demand about 1.5Mbps or more and this could have a dramatic impact on \"internet\" performance for your other computers.  Therefore, I had to get another wi-fi USB dongle for my main desktop to monitor traffic; one for my wireless \"internet\" home network, one for the surveillance network.Disable error correction on the router that feeds the cameras.  Most routers will have this enabled by default, so that if the router or camera receives errors during transmission, then the device will try to re-transmit the packets and slow the bi-directional transfer even more.  Other routers don't even have an interface to disable this function.  But this function is useless with streaming video, or VOIP for that matter since it would be pointless to receive/play video frames that should have been received earlier.From what I saw on the setup wizard, I can't really judge how good it would be for someone with no networking knowledge at all.  The interface doesn't seem intuitive, though.I don't know if more \"expensive\" cameras would provide a better interface for wireless setup.  I would think that they would, but would cost around 150 bucks or more.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Ok camera.  Poor color.", "Author": "JW \"wise1\"", "ReviewID": "R153BGD4F7JCNJ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Product arrived quick and as advertised. I was concerned as I have read some reviews of other similar cameras that the camera that was ordered was not what was shipped.  This seller sent what was advertised.No problem setting up since the setup is close to the X10 camera I already have.  X10 was a challenge, but had X10 support.  Will be a challenge for first time users not familiar with networking and port forwarding.  Software leaves something to be desired.  As noted on all these 'like' cameras (they are all about the same with small differences and a different name) the manual is poorly written.It is not what I consider a 'color' camera!  Picture is washed out brownish purple.  But, I have to say, it is not advertised as a 'color' camera.  Picture is not really clear.  Appears that change of light, like sun from under cloud, triggers motion.  I'll have to play with the sensitivity.  IR at night looks to be doing a good job.One nice thing about this type camera is they are self contained.  You do not have to have your PC running for it to send e-mail or upload to your FTP site when triggered.  This means if the crooks get in and steal the PC you will still have the pictures that were uploaded to the web.For full functionality you have to use Internet Explorer(32bit) and have ActiveX running.  Without it, it appears, you can not use some functions of the camera.  Especially if you have a PTZ camera.Another problem with these cameras is the wiring.  This particular camera has a short lead.  They all have a large end so it is not a matter of drilling a small hole to conceal the cord.  I built a small box next to the camera to conceal the cord.Overall I am ok with the camera.  Not worth the effort to return it.  It will accomplish what I need.  Would I buy another one?  Probably not.UPDATE 07/01/12: Camera would 'blink' in the daylight.  Each time it did it would set of another alert.  After speaking with Wansview(he logged in and looked at the picture) he advised the camera (should have good color and should not 'blink') was defective and I should return it.I will not order another camera like this one.", "Date": "June 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "crap", "Author": "Gary Ferguson", "ReviewID": "R32I4B7E53P37P", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "after about a month of use this outdoor waterproof camera filled with rain water and no longer worked.

The results was just amazing. I mean, the image quality is OK. Under certain light conditions, the colors maybe can not be the right ones, but the thing is you use this cameras to see if there is someone out there, not to see what it is wearing.In my particular opinion, the are just great.The only downs, this one doesn't have audio (NCB541W is has!), but is still ok for me.
