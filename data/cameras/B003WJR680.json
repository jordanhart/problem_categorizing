{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Excellent Waterproof, Point & Shoot Camera!!", "Author": "Luigi \"Ping\"", "ReviewID": "R19OP5HBD2KBFT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS10, when compared to other waterproof point & shoot cameras, is an excellent choice!  I've used a number of Olympus \"Tough\" cameras (6000, 8000, etc.) and the Panasonic competes more than admirably.Shutter lag seems to be a nagging issue with most waterproof, point & shoot cameras.  I find the DMC-TS10 has very little shutter lag--signficantly less than any waterproof, point & shoot Olympus I've used.  I can't tell you how irritating and frustrating it is to push the shutter and have a camera wait 1/2 to 1 second before it responds.The menu is much more intuitive and less \"layered\" than the Olympus cameras.  One nice feature is the ability to take a picture at any time regardless where you are in the menu system.  A simple, light touch of the shutter button brings you immediately into picture taking mode no matter where you are in the menu system.Picture quality is very good to excellent.  It won't compete with a digital SLR, but it is definitely above average in the waterproof, point & shoot category.  Battery life is also very good.  I was able to shoot almost 45 minutes of 720 HD video before the battery exhausted.  Note: you can only shoot approx. 8 min. of continuous video before you must start again.  Also, inexpensive aftermarket batteries are available; however, they must be \"firmware\" compatible with the DMC-TS10, otherwise they will not work.  As of this writing I was not able to determine the number of pictures that can be taken on one battery charge.The DMC-TS10 comes with an attractive silicone case that does an excellent job of protecting the camera both in and out of the water.One final note: if you read the various Amazon reviews, I think you'll find ALL waterproof, point & shoot cameras have some waterproof integrity issues.  All the waterproof, point & shoot cameras I've seen (regardless of price) have a very similar design in terms of access to the memory card, battery, and USB/power/charging connectors.  Bottom line, if you try to open the door on any of these cameras when the camera is wet in any way, you risk permananently damaging the camera.  From my experience, you have to let the camera sit for a few hours before attempting to open any of the access doors.  If you choose to not let the camera \"air dry\" and just dry the outside of the camera, water will remain underneath the edges of the doors.  The moment you open the door water gets pulled into the interior of the camera (via a vacuum affect) no matter how careful you are drying the camera.If you're looking for a waterproof, point & shoot camera, with good/excellent picture quality, minimal shutter lag/delay, good ease of use, and good battery life, the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS10 is DEFINITELY worth considering!", "Date": "April 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "Lots of features, noisy (fuzzy) images, works when it gets wet", "Author": "Bob Tobias \"Robert Tobias\"", "ReviewID": "R2M7MXRDOZG567", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bottom line:  Takes good snapshots if conditions are \"just so\" (bright but not harsh sunlight), even in the pool.What I liked: - It keeps working even when it's wet. - iA (Intelligent Automatic) mode, where the camera automatically selects among six of the more common scene modes. - The documentation is clear and complete. That applies to both the manual (provided electronically) and the information provided on-camera.What I didn't like: - Images at any ISO (sensitivity) setting are noisy (fuzzy).  They get very noisy at all but the lowest settings. - Zoom DOES NOT work when shooting videos. - It takes five button presses to go between taking pictures and movies.Other things: - This camera DOES NOT FIT in the Case Logic TBC-302 Ultra Compact Camera Case with Storage (Black).  However, the Case Logic TBC-312 Pocket Video Camcorder Case with Storage (Black) works fine.  (I have both.) - Watch the price.  I've seen it fluctuate on an almost daily basis.  The black version is particularly susceptible to price dips; I got mine for 66% of list. - A spare battery is good to have with a digital camera.  This is especially with this one becuase the battery life is on the short side.  Amazon has plenty of inexpensive aftermarket choices such as the MaximalPower DMW-BCH7 Li-Ion Rechargeable Digital Camera Battery for Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP1 DMC-FP2 DMC-FP3 DMC-FT10 DMC-TS10. - I've been using the Pentax Optio Floating Wrist Strap for Cameras for a long time and it works great with this camera.  It's comfortable and easily stays on the surface with this camera attached.Final Thoughts:  If you want a point and shoot camera that takes good pictures all the time look elsewhere.  If you want one that will work in and around the pool this is can be an \"OK\" value.  However, don't let the abundance of available features steer you away from considering a less expensive, more basic waterproof camera that could wind up taking better pictures.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping. I've always appreciated the help I've received from other reviewers and work hard to return the favor as best as I can.  I hope you found this review helpful and if there was anything you thought was lacking or unclear leave a comment and I'll do what I can to fix it.", "Date": "August 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "Perfect for the armchair adventurist", "Author": "RK", "ReviewID": "R1RUUNNJ56BINY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I'm using waterproof cameras for over 20 years now.  Primary use is kayaking / canoeing / hiking, often multi day trips.This is a surprisingly small camera, easy to use and it takes great pictures. Took over 3000 pictures so far and the vast majority of them came out very good. Indoor flash pictures are a little bit iffy, without flash and a steady hand they usually turn out great. The \"high speed burst mode\" is amazing for a point and shoot camera and takes around 4 pictures a second (at a reduced 3 megapixel resolution).  Overall picture quality in the normal 14 MP mode is very good and compares well to the Canon 1300 IS.  The \"intelligent auto\" is reasonable good, but it is also easy to setup preferences.There are two things I don't like at all on this camera, the small, proprietary battery and the proprietary USB connector.The cell phone market finally agreed to use the same, standard USB connector, there is no reason why Panasonic couldn't do the same. A replacement USB cable from Panasonic retails for over $30. At least the camera is using a standard SD card, so if the USB cable is lost, it is not such a big deal to plug the SD card directly into the laptop, but again, I can't think about a technical reason why this camera has to use a proprietary USB connector.The small \"DMW-BCH7\" battery is more of an issue.  The strong point on the camera is the rugged, waterproof design.  There are several pages in the manual that emphasis how important it is to keep the waterproof seals around the battery compartment intact. Even a small brush is included to clean the gaskets. Obviously, any small piece of dirt or even just a hair caught in the seals will compromise the waterproof design.For a camera that is designed to be taken outside into the elements, I don't understand why it comes with a battery that lasts only around 200 to 250 pictures and a design that requires me to remove the battery for charging.  When was the last time we had to remove a cell phone battery or a laptop battery to charge?Even a small 4 GB memory card can hold 750 pictures in the standard 14 MegaPixel setting... why not have a battery that will last that long?  This would minimize opening the sealed battery door while outdoors.The included battery charger for this camera will only work for that particular battery model. So in our case, we have 3 different Panasonic cameras and need to travel with 3 different chargers! There just got to be a better way.If this camera could use standard AA rechargeable batteries it would be the perfect rugged outdoor camera.", "Date": "February 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Nice Waterproof Camera. Survived snorkeling in the Carribean", "Author": "Jeffrey Hovik", "ReviewID": "R1CZSCMDAEQNLD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I was a little nervous when I first bought this camera after reading a review about the camera leaking underwater. I'm pleased to say it not only held up underwater but was there when I needed it.  My wife and I took a vacation with 1 week spent at Disney world and then 1 week in the Virgin Islands. I knew we would be doing a lot of snorkeling while in the Caribbean and I was praying the camera wouldn't leak and destroy all the pictures we had on it from Disney World. We took good care of it and followed the instructions to the letter before using it underwater and never had any issues. We left the silicon cover on it underwater so we wouldn't accidentally unlock the battery compartment. We snorkeled 1-3 hours a day for 6 days and the camera worked flawlessly.  Its a little pricey for what you get but it powers up fast, has descent zoom, lots of features, takes good action photos, the video recording is good, its compact and rugged and survived everything we threw at it. The battery lasted better than expected and never died on us. Overall I'm very pleased with this good looking camera.", "Date": "February 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Rugged, & versatile but more importantly waterproof.", "Author": "Don J.

elements I'll probably face out there, and this camera was definitely a good choice.-Video-The video included has been reduced in quality a bit to fit the limits of the 100mb upload onto amazon.I took it to the Aquarium and dunked it in for a video of Manta rays and Leopard sharks.It's original quality which was sitting at HD 1280x720 frame, 30fps, 29mbps bit rate, audio at 256kbps.However, it still looks great in this video which was downgraded to 25fps, 368x208 frame, 621kbps bit rate, 1.8mb, and audio at 74kbps.PROS:Works underwater!I have yet to push the camera to the depths of 10ft and more, mostly because I'm a little hesitant to really try that anytime soon (and risk losing the camera altogether).A good investment would be the Olympus' float strap for fishing trips, surfing, or if you plan on being on open waters.The orange helps locate it out there if you lose it. (Olympus STRAP FLOAT ORANGE)I also bought a Transcend 16GB class 10 memory card (Transcend 16GB Class 10 SDHC Card (TS16GSDHC10)) for it, and i get an upwards of 3000 pictures at 14mp.The design is sleek and compact.  Beats a few other waterproof digital point and shooters that are less attractive.Compare for yourself at this nifty site i found before purchasing this model a few months ago:[...]CONS:-If there's a smudge, or water drop on the lens prior to shooting dry pictures they add random speckles on your pictures and can really detract from the shots. I suggest bringing a microfiber cloth around to clean the lens when you're dry.SUMMARY:Overall the quality of the pictures are decent, but the features are plenty.[New Edit 1 year ownership]: The images you process are noisy at any iso setting, as other users have mentioned, but for the work-ability & dependability you really can't go wrong with this model.", "Date": "January 11, 2011"}, {"Title": "Worth Every Dime", "Author": "Michael", "ReviewID": "R2BHPH5QOZL5CZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "By far one of the best Digital Cameras I have ever owned!

A. P. \"G.A.P.\"", "ReviewID": "R2E0TXHBPTLY8X", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is offered at a very competitive price which enticed me to buy it for a recent trip. Now all I can think of is the old maxim \"You Get What You Pay For.\"  In this case, I got a poor quality camera that even the manufacturer seems to acknowledge.  Here are my quarrels with this camera and why you may want to look elsewhere in spite of the low price:1. POOR PICTURE QUALITY - Maybe it's the lens or the quality of the electronics, but the pictures I did manage to take with this camera were washed out and otherwise of poor quality (particularly in bright light situations).  My camera phone did a better job in bright light situations.2. CONDENSATION ISSUES - I should have known something was up when Panasonic went so far as to put a special insert in the box about condensation issues and problems with the lens clouding over. Although Panasonic provides \"tips\" for avoiding this problem, my conclusion is that the design of this camera makes such issues unavoidable.  After only a few weeks, and even following all the tips, the lens on this camera clouded over from condensation.  The lens is now permanently cloudy and there is nothing you can do about it.  The camera is rendered useless.  I've used a lot of cameras in a lot of environments.  This one is just not designed to take it. I am going to send this camera in for warranty service and I will post an addendum to let you know how it turns out.  I'm not holding my breath that Panasonic will cover this problem.3. WATERPROOF SEALS ARE POOR QUALITY AND MUST BE REPLACED \"AT EXTRA COST\" YEARLY - That's right folks.  Read the fine print.  The requirements for keeping this camera waterproof read like a novel.  Even if you do everything right, Panasonic says the flimsy waterproof seals need to be replaced every year at your cost.  They surely don't tell you this up front. Can you imagine having to bring this $140 camera to an authorized repair facility every year and being charged for replacing the seals?  Nobody is going to do that and Panasonic knows it.  It's basically a disposable camera if you bring it in the water to begin with.  After one year Panasonic admits it.  Mine didn't make it past two months.I love praising a good product at a good price.  This camera is not such a product.  In my humble opinion, you would be better off spending a little more and getting a better waterproof camera that is truly as rugged as they claim.ADDENDUM: OF COURSE PANASONIC BLAMED ME FOR THE CAMERA HAVING CONDENSATION DAMAGE AND REFUSED TO HONOR THE WARRANTY. CLAIMS THERE IS CORROSION BUT THEY HAVE NO PHOTOS SHOWING IT. WITH A STRAIGHT FACE THEY OFFERED TO FIX A $139 CAMERA (PRICE I PAID)FOR $189 AND ASKED ME HOW I WOULD LIKE TO PAY FOR THE REPAIR. WOW - YOU WOULD HAVE TO BE A KNUCKLEHEAD TO EVER AGAIN DEAL WITH PANASONIC AND THEIR PRODUCTS.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "The best waterproof camera for under $300 - UPDATE!", "Author": "Gabriel Young", "ReviewID": "R4ZUZP2MZ0LXI", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "UPDATE (May 24, 2012):My camera was 15 months into a 12 month warranty, this camera stops working. Water got in the battery and SD compartment. Now I can turn the camera on and take a single picture, that's it. I can't operate any of the buttons on the back. Essentially this is now useless to me.I went back and read the manual more carefully and it states that the seals would deteriorate in about a year's time. Way to go Panasonic for making a product that's only supposed last 12 months.I contacted Panasonic and they asked me to send it in to see how much it would cost to repair it (since it's out of warranty). They quoted me $180.25, which is more expensive than simply buying a brand new one!----------Remember those days when our options were limited to a waterproof disposable camera or a crazy expensive casing? That was only about five years ago and all of a sudden we have many choices!I've tried several waterproof cameras and this is by far the best that I've found (in case you're curious, the worst was Fujifilm FinePix XP10 12 MP Waterproof Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver)). Don't even consider using one of those Kodak video cams for pics since those are terrible in low light and have no optical zoom. Here's how this Lumix performs in various conditions:-OUTDOORS/DAY-Like most cameras, pictures are incredible when brightly lightly lit, especially outdoors. These pics are right up there with my Canon Powershot.-INDOORS-More noise than I'd like but still respectable. If well-lit and subject isn't moving, pictures are decent.-LOW LIGHT-Not good at all but I didn't expect pics from a waterproof camera to be good in low light conditions. I'll use my regular point-and-shoot or my SLR for these purposes.-UNDERWATER-Some of the best underwater pics you can ask for. No blur at all when in a pool, even when cloudy. I'm assuming if the water is clear, like the Caribbean, this camera will do what you need it to do - take clear, vivid pics.-SNOW-Yes, it's perfect in the snow too. Due to the generally bright environment when around snow, pics come out pretty good and there's no need to worry about using it with wet gloves. My hands are happy.In short, for indoor and low light shots, I use another camera. Almost all other times I'll have this in my pocket due to its durability and flexibility. With several kids in tow, this camera is almost always on my person when we're out.", "Date": "January 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nice little camera from Panasonic", "Author": "PK5353", "ReviewID": "R3KM8GHOG8RGEN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera before taking a trip to Mexico in September 2011.  It's not the most expensive camera, so I was hoping for it to last the trip.  It performed admirably.  Went swimming in the Carribean and used the camera without any leakage.  Pictures are acceptable and can be tweaked with Photoshop.  Went snorkeling in brackish and salt water a few days later and was pleased with it's performance.  It did not leak and the pictures were good of the fish and underwater terrain.  Understand these are not going to look like something out of National Geographic, but the results will bring back some pleasant memories.  One thing I did do was inspect the camera and seals after reading the manual thoroughly.  After using it I let it sit in fresh water for a while then wiped and let it dry off.  Only then did I open the door for the SD Card and battery.  I also let it dry open for an hour or so, wiped the gaskets and then carefully closed the door.I'm taking it with me on another vacation shortly.", "Date": "November 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Some quirks, but GREAT for reviewing frame-by-frame video", "Author": "Todd Minnella", "ReviewID": "R17ZBE7MV96FOB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have tested the camera's waterproof-ness (on purpose) and drop-proof-ness (by accident, onto concrete) and it is still doing great.

If you have a need to take and very quickly review video frame-by-frame, this camera is OUTSTANDING at it.  The buttons/interface for play/pause and prev/next frame are all right there - you don't have to navigate around to find the \"next frame\" menu item, like you do on some other cameras.  It is very easy and very fast to use.The quirk that I have come to work around is that this camera does not stop recording when you press the button to stop.  Instead, it trims the video to 1-2 seconds BEFORE you pressed the button to stop recording.  So I have learned to just let it record well past the event that I want to review before stopping the recording.The battery has lasted me about 60 minutes of near-constant use (recording, then reviewing frame-by-frame video).", "Date": "November 1, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great little camera", "Author": "V.

I haven't looked at point and shoot pictures with any kind of criticism since last Christmas, and I was originally disappointed with the quality of these pictures.  They tend to be a little noisy/fuzzy, and not necessarily \"tack sharp,\" BUT THEY'RE FROM A POINT AND SHOOT THAT IS WATER PROOF!  I bought this camera because my hubby regularly dumps us over in the canoe on float trips and there is no rational way to excuse taking more than a grand in camera equipment down river when you know it's going into the water sooner or later.  Have already had previous issues with supposed \"water tight bags,\" not GOING there.  So, a waterproof camera became a \"must.\"This camera is great for fun snap shots and at fairly close range.  The zoom makes you feel like you got maybe 40 or 50 feet closer to whatever you were looking at (at least that was how it felt when I went from unzoomed to zoom from my front porch looking towards my barn and arbor - I had gotten across the front yard and was maybe ten feet from the arbor at \"full zoom.\"  Don't expect to hear a blackbird in the tree a hundred yards away and zoom in on this thing and get a \"right beside it\" style picture.  Not happening, and with the IQ, you're not going to be able to crop out a really interesting bird picture, either.However, if you're canoeing, at the pool, at the beach, etc., and you want a camera that you don't have to have a heart attack about if you set it down on a beach towel and it comes in contact with sand, or if you take it into the water and some gets splashed on it (do NOT take it to a lower depth than recommended or force water at it because that will invalidate the warranty; also read and review manufacturer's instructions regarding the seals and how to clean the camera after it has been exposed to various elements), this camera is for you.  I think I will enjoy it on my next float trip, even though I'll never get the breath-taking shots I would hope for from this.  Maybe one day I'll get some of my DSLR pictures published/sold and be able to afford to look at higher resolution, better waterproof cameras (maybe pigs will fly, too, because if I got that much money I'd be investing it in an f/2.8 zoom lens), but for what I wanted it for and what its capabilities should be, it meets the test very well.  Since I wasn't bowled over and thrilled by the image quality, though, I'm just going to give it four out of five instead of five stars.Oh - on LCD shooting - the screen hasn't given me trouble in any light (unless you're in some kinds of sunglasses, then you kind of have to look underneath them).

The silicone jacket is especially appealing because it protects the camera exterior from dings (except the LCD screen, of course) It is also very compact.  Image quality is good.  Good value at the Amazon price.  I like the Kodak pocket cameras for video but they cost almost as much as the TS10 but have no flash and no optical zoom and no OIS.  Their video is an excellent 1080p, however, whereas the TS10 is 720p.  Can't have everything...yet.Cons: Will not optically zoom while recording video.  Does not have a dedicated video button, but you can set it up so that using the iA button on top of the camera will switch between video and iA mode.  You still have to press the shutter button to start and stop the recording.  (I actually like using the shutter button better than a dedicated video button, which is usually on the back of the camera and somewhat difficult to press.)  The TS10 video format is .mov.

In certain kinds of light, the back view screen just doesn't show what you are looking at and is virtually black. Underwater, it was often a guess as to whether what you pointed toward was actually what you were taking a picture of.

I will qualify my disappointment over my very mediocre snorkeling shots with the admission that I had never used a camera underwater before. But I found it very hard to use the LCD screen in the water and thus had problems following and focusing on the many colorful fish that were present around Buck Island off St. Croix. Above the water, however, the camera produced spectacular photos in deep, rich colors and sharp detail, of many different scenes, including sailing and swim shots, sea- and landscapes, night photos, portraits, street scenes, and even excellent aerial photography. My favorites, however, are the sunset photos of the palm-fringed Caribbean beaches; they are truly breathtaking, almost better than what I have been able to produce with my Sony DSC-R1 with its premium Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar f/2.8 telephoto zoom lens. The Lumix DMC-TS10 proved sturdy and durable, simple to operate, and it is, indeed, waterproof. I found that it does not require a lot of coddling to keep it that way if one follows the simple precautions. I even dropped it on the ocean floor because I was careless in not tightening the carrying strap sufficiently to prevent its slipping off my wrist. Fortunately, one of the snorkeling tour guides was quick to recognize what had happened and dove in the water to retrieve the camera unharmed. I'm almost certain that, with some additional practice, my next snorkeling trip will produce better underwater photos.", "Date": "January 9, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect for 4 year old", "Author": "David Johnson \"satisfied\"", "ReviewID": "R163GKBJZ58M1C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Christmas gift to our 4 year old grand daughter.

Looking forward to using it this summer while kayaking, one of the reasons I wanted the waterproof feature.It got a recommended rating from Consumer Reports, which was another reason I bought it. Taking low light pictures at the telephoto end sometimes did produce blurred photos, but I emphasize \"sometimes\". All of the other features seem to work well.I also purchased the Case Logic TBC 302Ultra Compact Camera Case, which the camera fits into perfectly. Good deal for the $5.64 I paid for it. It also holds a memory card & spare battery. I suggest getting them both.Memory Card:  Transcend 8 GB SDHC Class 6 TS8GSDHC6E ($11.99) good for 1600 still photos, which is more then enough for whatever trip you're taking. You only get about 10 shots with the built in card. The only thing I don't like is having to connect the USB cable to my PC when downloading the photos to it. With my older camera I just need to plug in the memory card. Might be the card since it's \"High Capacity\" or the camera. Have a feeling it's the way the camera functions. No big deal.Battery:  Maximal Power DMW BCH7 Li-Ion ($12.75) works well & is made for this camera. The batteries both the one that come with the camera & this one don't seem to last as long as the three AA batteries I use in my old Sony Digital but it's not a big deal, plus my Sony is a lot bigger & heavier then this camera. That's why it pays to get a back up, plus it takes only 1 \u00bd hours to fully charge it, which can be done while having dinner & be ready for your next days shooting.

This happens EVERY time I turn the camera on. ANNOYING!Also, the menu is not very easy to use, for example, if you have it on video, then want to turn it on and take a picture, you can't switch modes from the external camera buttons- you have to turn the camera on, and then go into the menu and switch over from there, so it takes a long time to get the camera set up for the mode you want. My old Sony camera let me handle all that from the external camera buttons.Video is decent, but it makes HUGE files which take forever to upload. In fact, when uploading about 20 short videos from my last trip, it took so long to upload them that the fully charged camera battery died before they could all upload!Also, after this attempt, my computer no longer recognizes the pictures on the camera/ memory stick and it won't let me upload them to my computer. Sucks.Make sure if when you're taking water photos, you don't have any water drops on the lense, or you will have water drops on your photos. This happens when you submerge the camera, then take photos in the water, but holding the camera above the water.Summary: I wouldn't buy this camera.

I bought this inexpensive waterproof camera with the intent of strictly using it on the beach to get photos we would normally miss because of my fear of risking damage to my Nikon dSLR or Canon S90.  This camera serves that purpose.  I would not recommend this camera as an overall or everyday camera though.  It really does lack in several areas.  One big disappointment was the lack of quality for low light conditions (including lighted indoor shots).  For these shots, the camera relies too much on high ISO settings and results in grainy washed out photos.  The other disappointment was the lcd screen.  The screen is not vivid at all and its resolution leaves a lot to be desired.  It does seem like the camera takes decent outdoor shots when plenty of light is available.  Which takes me back to why I bought this camera in the first place, well lit beach photos.  So I think I will be fine.Bottome line: This camera will serve its purpose for me on the beach, pool etc., but I will use my other 2 cameras everywhere else.

Outside pictures are fine.  I took better pictures in low light with my old 10 mp Canon Powershot, that cost half as much.", "Date": "December 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "died young", "Author": "Mark J.
