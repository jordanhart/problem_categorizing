Second, because with my first one I went to the ocean and it didn't survive. Thanks God I still have all the great pictures it took.I remember when I purchased my first Exilim, my friends were making jokes that I'm buying a watch, not a camera. But in my opinion Casio makes much better cameras than Canon or Nikon (these are the brands I can compare to). The picture quality is great, the colors are FANTASTIC - nothing needs to be improved by PhotoShop ;)My new EX-S8 already took some amazing pictures, it's nice, light, slim and unexpensive. For me - not being a professional photographer - the Casio Exilim is absolutely awesome.", "Date": "September 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent Camera but battery is not as good", "Author": "photobugz", "ReviewID": "R8NO9B8WUKOMF", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "We decided to get a second camera.  Since we love our Casio Z1000 so much, another Casio was our first choice.  This little camera has all the features and then some, campared to the Z1000.  If you want a point and shoot that's easy to use and handle, at an affordable price, then this is the camera for you.The only cons have to do with the battery.  It's a dismal 700mAh compared to the 1300mAh for the Z1000.  That means the battery life is about 1/2... 1/2 the pics and twice charging.To make it worse, the battery has to be removed from the camara and placed into a cradle to recharge.  It can't be 'plugged and charged' like other cameras and devices.  Of course it's not difficult to do, but would you buy a cell phone if you had to remove the battery every time you wanted to charge?  Probably not.The camera is nice; however, the battery issues make us want to look for a different brand camera.", "Date": "February 21, 2011"}, {"Title": "All Good But One", "Author": "Naz", "ReviewID": "RNRPAY59B1W6B", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The camera overall is pretty small, i still think it would have been a little nicer if it was thinner but manageable. The screen is more than adequate, the pictures are pretty decent also, in low ligth enviroments you have to tinker with the settings to get better shots. The only reall problem i have with this camera is the optical zoom which is pretty short. This i a major issue with compact digital cameras. Battery life is decent as well, and the flash is plenty bright. The video recorder is very good as it records in 480-- which is dvd quality and it records as much as the memory stick can hold, which is a featuer i love. All in all for a camera under a hundred bucks i think its pretty well rounded and i definately think you should give it a spin.Naz..", "Date": "November 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "Love My Camera", "Author": "apoem \"apoem\"", "ReviewID": "R26C88DFE5MQL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I would strongly suggest this to someone else as a great camera to buy. I have managed to put it through it's paces a little bit trying to take photos at night, of fireworks, in low lighting and inside and outside and of kids etc.First the ProsThis is a very slim camera with a large screen on the back. I like the large screen.I particularly like that the buttons are somewhat flat or recessed so it is difficult to turn this camera by accident or to snag buttons while you are using it.This is a fairly easy to use camera. If you are looking for a specific situation you can push a button called bs (For best shot) and come up with a series of scenarios you can use to take a good picture (for example, kids, fireworks, flowers etc). I have used several of these and each one has helped me to take better photos. I have used fireworks and have made some lovely fire work photos. They are far from professional or even a hobbyist level but they look good to the casual person. Similarly the one option for children, flowers, and food.The videos are easy to take and they have a good play back quality.Overall, this camera is one I would buy again should something happen to this one. This is an easy to use, intuitive camera.The ConsThe problems I have had with this camera or some of the concerns that you might want to look at before buying.This camera does not have a view finder. To add the little visual view finder you either add quite a bit more money or more weight and in some instances both. This was not near as important to me as it would be to other people. Second, I have not had this problem and I've been using this for several weeks now but there might be some concern about being able to use the screen view finder in high light levels outside as it makes it hard to see the screen.When you are using the bs and if you don't use the camera for a few minutes (such as waiting for fireworks to start again) and if the camera goes off, when you want to take your next shot you will have to go through the whole bs process again in order to take photos. It doesn't take much time to touch bs and scroll through the options and click on the one you want. However, should you be trying to capture something fast moving (fireworks for instance) then there is a possibility you will miss it.There are other cameras out there that are bigger with more options. I like some of the cannons with the swiveling screen and used the swiveling screen way more than I thought I would. However, for something easy to carry, light weight, high speed, with enough options that you won't miss the ones you don't have- this is an excellent camera. I love mine.Enjoy.", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Comparable to higher priced brands", "Author": "Brandon Hand", "ReviewID": "R3HFKI2O9BQY5O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I researched this camera for about a week before I purchased it. It was similarly spec'ed to higher priced Nikons and Canons. After reading every review I could find, and comparing every spec listed, I decided it was worth it.Now, after having it for a few months, I can say without a doubt, it is a great purchase.It is very reliable and with the Class 10 SDHC card I also purchased for it, incredibly fast. The facial recognition works wonderfully and the image stabilization is very noticeable in the videos I've recorded. I keep this in my pocket wherever I go because it's slim and easy to carry around, and I want to be ready for that crazy thing that no one will believe happened.If you're on the fence about spending over $100 on a point and shoot, I highly suggest this camera. For $20 less, you can get the same features and quality, minus the famous brand tax.", "Date": "May 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "Casio doesn't disappoint", "Author": "Boop", "ReviewID": "R2VPAUY5JLJH17", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already had a Casio and although it was out-dated, I loved the ease of using it.  It was small, light-weight, and took abuse.  It lasted me about five years and three trips to Italy.  Finally, when the lens wouldn't extend I decided I needed another camera.  Originally, I wanted something with more fun features but decided to get another Exilim so I would have less of a learning curve and I'm glad I did.  I ordered it and had it sent directly to Arizona where I was visiting family for the holidays and was able to open the box and start taking pictures!  No stress.  The only surprise was that a \"black\" camera meant it was plastic.  I thought it was a 'color' choice when choosing between that and silver.  My original one was silver, therefore metal.  If I had known, I would have gotten silver and paid the extra 10bucks.

It may be a defect of the particular camera I bought, but the photos lacked contrast and 'crispness'.  They seemed washed out.  A blow-up of a small part of the picture showed why.  Compared to a blow-up of the same photo but taken with my similarly priced Olympus, the image had a 'water-colour' fuzzines to it. Very few of the small details were shown in the Casio photo while they were very clear in the Olympus.  Again, this may be caused by a malfunction of the camera I bought.If the other nice features and price of this camera fit your needs, try it out and compare the results to those of your present camera.

It's still a point-and-shoot, but it has all the latest electronic goodies (except image stabilization), a nice large format, a relatively intuitive interface (considering the complexity of the product and how little time people will devote to learning it, yeah) and a small form factor.
