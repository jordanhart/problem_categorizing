Malcolm", "ReviewID": "R2ZMDHBNLWWE75", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I watched the price drop on this camera for a couple of months and then made the purchase after Christmas.  Maybe end of year inventory cycles created the 2 week delay before delivery.  I am a little disappointed in the picture quality, but it is still a good value for the price.  The anti blur setting is a must if zoomed in at all and the red eye effect leaves a lot to be desired in close ups requiring the flash.  Good quality, inexpensive cases for this camera are plentiful.  I explored several lens zooms (up to 12x) and settled on this 5x as a compromise, since the longer zooms appear to require more power and reduce battery life.  My goal was a higher quality, zoomable camera to use when my iPhone proves inadequate and this product fills the bill.", "Date": "January 30, 2010"}, {"Title": "EasyShare Kodak", "Author": "R.

The camera is a new addition to my camera family and I love it for its ease of use, picture quality, picture resolution and much more.  Kodak gives you excellent follow up after you register the camera.  I am pleased with my purchase which also arrived in a timely manner and in time for Christmas.  Thank You Amazon.", "Date": "January 7, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera Defective and Kodak 'Support' Nonexistent", "Author": "Hythlodaeus", "ReviewID": "R1DHES5KSE7BXM", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The camera worked briefly but was soon unable to recognize ANY SD card. Whenever a card is placed inside, the camera gives an error message stating that the card needs to be formatted. When you give it the go-ahead to format the card, nothing happens and the error message pops up again. Formatting the card externally and retrying changes nothing. The worst part about this experience is the total lack of Kodak support. While companies typically make it easy for buyers to obtain older drivers and firmware, Kodak has removed all trace of any software related to this product. To confirm this, do a search on this error message - i.e. memory card unreadable - and you'll find countless people with the problem and absolutely NO support from Kodak. Furthermore, Kodak will have nothing to do with you if you attempt to contact them via online chat, email, or phone about this issue. Since this is how Kodak treats customers who spend money on their products, I WILL NEVER TOUCH ANOTHER KODAK PRODUCT AGAIN.", "Date": "July 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "I LOVE my Easyshare C190", "Author": "Penny E.

I have several older digital Kodaks and I find the Kodaks have the best color. I have an older Nikon Coolpix I got as a gift and the Kodak has better natural color. I use this at work so I didn't want an expensive camera, they get broken and I have broken several! This one was even refurbished. It is small and light, for what it is, I have no complaints. The Auto focuse needs a second or two to focus so if you snap off fast shots, they may be blurry. It uses rechargable AA batteries not some proprietary type. I just got a new NIKON Coolpix S8200 for rewards points so we will see which one takes better photos, It has a 14X zoom, the Kodak is a 5X.  I am not a professional, I just take photos for fun. All the photos taken here are with the little Kodak Easyshare C190:[...]", "Date": "November 12, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent buy for the $", "Author": "J. M.

I take regular pix's on the sport/action setting to reduce blur.  I feel it works better than the anti blur selection.  No sound on video camera playback but when you download it is there.

I do not understand how this camera has received any good reviews at all. Even when you are viewing the scene through the digital screen the image is so very very grainy.  I have never seen a camera with such poor quality, disappointed in Kodak.

While this most certainly isn't the worst digital camera I've own, it's definitely not the best either. You'd expect better from the Kodak brand.I couldn't get this camera to take what I consider a really good picture--no matter how much I played around with the settings. They were either too blurry or the color was very off. Even when it showed me the \"subjects\" it would be focusing on, they still managed to be blurry and have a bit of a halo effect going on around them. (Face recognition was laughable at best.) When I zoomed in on objects, it took great pictures on autofocus, but when using the museum setting or the night setting, my pictures were always unrecognizable. My friend's 10mp Nikon took MUCH better pictures than this camera.However, I did like the sharing and tagging options. It made things really simple. I would give this camera to a child or someone who doesn't mind the slight blur. I ended up returning this and purchasing a Nikon instead.", "Date": "October 16, 2010"}, {"Title": "waste of money", "Author": "supernasty", "ReviewID": "R18928UQK5RSNP", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I thnk this is one of the most disapointing investments i have ever made. I bought the c190 two weeks before A trip home during a tour of duty in afghanistan. I figured I needed it so I can take pictures while I was home and use it when I got back overseas. But I guess kodak had other plans. I powered it up and managed to take 5 pics before I realized I had to get a memory card. No big deal. When I got back I managed to use it once more. Then that was it. The camera refused to open. The lens became jammed (later found out was a common problem). The thing is now a paper weight.
