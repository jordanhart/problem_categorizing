Really not much else to say, it is what it is.I'll explain how this one works.*When the 2 magnets are together, the contacts are open (means the current is stopped)*When the 2 magnets are apart, the contacts are closed (meaning the current is running)Like a light switch on the wall, the magnetic switch does the samething but using the magnet to do the switching.Hope that helps", "Date": "November 30, 2012"}, {"Title": "Magnetic switch", "Author": "Brandon", "ReviewID": "R5MDTCLKWQSPX", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I used this product for my safe... I used rope light inside to light it and wanted the lights to come on when the door opened for quick access... the switch works great...make sure to wire it to DC current only! I gave it four stars because the first one that came did not work...Amazon made good and sent me a new one at no charge with two day shipping...so I would give Amazon 5 stars on service.", "Date": "June 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "I Really Like These!", "Author": "John", "ReviewID": "R2QQHPRFD28EBC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought two and they both work great!  Used to switch off LED strips in cabinets when the doors are shut.  They are small and the tape holds them firmly.  Just make sure you wipe the surface you want to stick these to with alcohol, otherwise they might become loose.Also make sure that your 12V DC transformer is sized correctly to the wattage of your lights, or whatever you want to power.  Not sure how many watts these switches can handle but I'm not over 10 watts.Also note that these work in any orientation.  I have a set from another manufacturer (which I paid double the amount as these) and they only work when lined up one way (polarity).  I had to apply a small block of wood to the cabinet frame so they could align correctly.The product description says dimensions are 3.1 x 8 x 5 inches.  That might be the box size.  The magnet is 1.125\" long x 0.375\".Just ordered two more.  These are an awesome way to light a dark cabinet.", "Date": "December 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works great", "Author": "Katelyn Campbell", "ReviewID": "R2C5WUSL9VXB11", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I put this on the door to my gun safe.  My LED lights turn on when the door is open and turn off when the door is closed.  I did go to Lowes and pick up a bigger magnet which makes it easier to line up the connection.  The magnet on the swing door does not need to be the one provided in the kit FYI.  I would buy again!!", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Do not buy", "Author": "James T.

I wanted it to turn on when the door opened and turn off when the door was closed.  Worked great with my 12v 5m LED strip.

It's very convenient - both sides come with foam mounting tape, which is sufficient (I didn't use the screw-hole flanges at all), and the two sides work in basically any orientation with each other. The normally-open switch closes when the two sides are a couple inches apart, which in my installation, when mounted to the hinge-side of the door, equated to the door being opened about 9\". The wire is nice and long; I ended up cutting it much shorter to fit my purposes.The one downside is the leads are 24 AWG, so this is definitely a low-power device switch only.I'm not sure about its reliability and number of duty cycles, but it seems of decent construction and for a pantry closet door I expect it to last a long time.", "Date": "September 29, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good security switch", "Author": "tdinardo", "ReviewID": "R1CAXOZR82YKU7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Very small and accurate.

I put one on each door into the storage area on the RV to turn on some LED strip lights. The switch is pretty small and compact and the magnet is strong enough that it will open the circuit with the two pieces being a little ways apart. This worked well in my application. So far the adhesive on them is working well but there are also holes to screw them into place if needed.

These are smaller in size so if a lower profile is what you are after these may do the trick. They have a long (22 guage?) wire attached. Do make sure you understand normally open vs closed. These are normally closed menaing the switch closes when the magnet is away.

The switch is now in the ALWAYS on - meaning that the magnet has no effect, thus ruining the entire configuration.The LED strip I was sodering it to was 15\" long, so very minimal amount of current flowing through.Buyer beware - if you are a good soderer, and you can somehow protect the leads, the product will work as advertised, but any problems and you just through $8 down the drain.

This switch/switches lasted 7 tries before failure occurred. Intended VT/Watt spec of system, 12/24. This switch looked like it had promise at first, both switches were very sensitive, meaning, would open the circuit at a gap of 1 inch or less and close at gap larger then 1.5, but before permanent installation tried 7 times on each of the two units and both failed at 7 or fewer cycles. These switches may be useful in a circuit utilizing a milliamp relay but feel anything higher then just milliamps will burn the contacts, and for use inside a safe where you cant tell if the lights go out would be devastating. Just dont waist your money if using in a high watt/amp draw circuit like I did.", "Date": "March 18, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0009SUEZY"}}
