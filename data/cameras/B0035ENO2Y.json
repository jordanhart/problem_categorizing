Cheap, so as to not burden her with owning something expensive, good enough not to cramp her style, red enough to go with a Hello Kitty camera case. That was the idea. Zoom, a plus, small size a must. Already the first outing was a nice surprise. The camera handled very difficult lighting, and did well compared with a much more up-market camera. Since then, the budding photographer has been every bit as daring as we had imagined and the camera has delivered all that we expected from such a compact package and then some. It's hard to see which \"must-have\" feature we would have gotten even for twice the price, and we're sure glad we resisted the tempation to buy one of those \"kids' cameras\".", "Date": "November 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "great camera!", "Author": "Stacy \"Stacy\"", "ReviewID": "RFTRISVO0FVZI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Not expensive, but a great camera.

The quality of the pictures has never been great, but now the pictures are all fuzzy. Very disappointed!", "Date": "December 3, 2011"}, {"Title": "disappointed", "Author": "Becka Bruderer", "ReviewID": "R3JZK1EZOXKX6T", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has a big black spot on the lens (i presume), it's on all the faces, and it cannot be removed.  I really think, instead of stating \"in good condition. has minor wear from normal use.. 100% guaranteed against defects!\" it should state exactly what is wrong with it.  I ordered this for a kid I work with who wanted to give it to his sister for xmas.  Now what?!  Very disappointed, and it makes me not trust anything that I may buy in the future, since people don't want to be truthful in their descriptions.", "Date": "December 17, 2013"}, {"Title": "You Can Do Better", "Author": "Alexandra B. Northard", "ReviewID": "RBSWCJDMVA9MA", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I received this camera as a birthday present in July 2010. By the second time I used it, some dead cell showed up on the LCD screen (annoying black dot that is dime-sized). I had not dropped it or done any other harm to it, so apparently the LCD screen is super sensitive. Also, I have had a hard time getting the camera to focus on objects/subjects and the pictures turn out poor quality, whereas using another camera for the same thing produces nice images. I do wonder if having the camera shipped to me from another state damaged it, though. Maybe I just got a previously damaged camera? The positive things I will say about this camera is that it is small and compact, is easy to use, and I like that is has video mode. It also came with a rechargeable battery and has a good long battery life. I love the large LCD, too.In the past I have had Canon, Sony, Fuji, and Kodak digital cameras and they all took better quality pictures than this camera.", "Date": "February 13, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": null, "Name": "Samsung SL600 12 Megapixel Digital Camera with 5x Optical Zoom, 2.7\u00e2\u20ac LCD, Smart Auto, Digital Image Stabilization, Red", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41HR0zhbXWL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0035ENO2Y"}}
