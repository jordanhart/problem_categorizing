That fixes the lens, but then I get an error message telling me to repower again.

It is also very thin and fits nicely in your pocket.  The downside came the weekend after I bought the camera.  I was using at a birthday party for kids and my wife wanted to use it while I stepped out for a moment.  When I returned she said that the camera was broken.  Apparently, for no reason, when she tried to power on the camera the lens extended and then there was a buzzing sound and the camera then turned off and displayed an \"Lens Error\" message on the LCD.  I took the camera back to where I bought it and exchanged it for a second camera.  I hope this was just a flook but there is quite a bit of information on the Web about this exact problem with other Casio models.  I plan to enjoy this fine camera and keep my fingers crossed that I got a dud the first go around.  If it breaks again during my 90 window to return it to the store, I am going to get a refund and look into a Canon or Nikon.", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "My Second Casio with even more Oomph!", "Author": "Chet Ragsdale \"Marine Veteran\"", "ReviewID": "R2OS4YM54W2401", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am giving this 5 stars initially. So far it is an awesome little camera, lightweight, highly functional with even more features than my previous the 7.2mp EX120. This camera takes a lithium ion battery and I like it, much easier to recharge and it holds a charge longer than the AA batteries in my previous model. I am going on vacation soon to the mountains and intend to put this to the test. I will have a detailed report soon. Stay tuned for Part 2......PART 2 08/10/2009 Back from vacation, camera performed flawlessly in all sorts of conditions. Took around 140 pics. I explored a multitude of settings and they all worked well. The self timer was great for shots where my son and I wanted in together...4 settings on that up to 10 second delay. I used the auto exposure, with some of my own settings, but not the Easy mode...I find it to be too easy..I like to vary the settings especially the ISO...The noise that some people mention is a non issue in my book..not enough to worry about. For the money in a 10MP camera, you can't go wrong with this gem.12/6/2009-With the advent of digital cameras, as in so many other electronic items in the 21st century..the quest for perfection has been staggering. Every camera company dueling for the smallest, lightest, most megapixels, etc etc;. Just like receivers, and televisions and DVD players, etc; the bar is raised daily. Each time we buy a new piece of equipment it seems like they are already about to release the next version , which is even better! With these things in mind. I personally like Canon , Nikon, Minolta, Fujica, Olympus etc; the companies who have been around the longest. However...Casio , Sony etc; have come on in recent years with very good cameras and electronics. My point is , that with so many millions of cameras being sold yearly and with all the technology and micro electronics piled into one tiny camera, occasionally you might get one that does not function right. I would not let this sway you in your purchase. These things happen with every one of the manufacturers. You should be alert within the warranty period for any items thatdon't seem right and while you may be without it for a short period, it will be fixed.", "Date": "July 24, 2009"}, {"Title": "Amazing camera, I might get another one", "Author": "Joseph Dewey", "ReviewID": "R1JJN6Y8V6RILZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera. If I broke this camera, I'd buy another one immediately, I like it that much.I bought it because I needed a cheap camera that I could keep in my pocket, and the \"nice\" one I bought a couple years ago was pretty bulky.  After taking a few pictures with this, the quality was so much better than the pictures from my \"nice\" camera, that my \"nice\" camera is now a paperweight.This camera takes about 250 pictures with the flash on.  I got a Kingston 8 GB SDHC Class 4 Flash Memory Card SD4/8GB for it, which is about 1500 high-quality pictures, so I bought a couple CTA Digital DB-CANP80 NP-80 Rechargeable Lithium-Ion Battery (850mAh, 3.6V) Replacement for Casio NP-80 Battery's to go along with it.

The camera developed a \"lens error\" within a couple of weeks of purchase. Casio says that this error is caused by user and not covered under warranty. They want $79 to repair a camera worth $100. Very poor quality, for now on I'll be sticking with Nikon.NOTE: Casio says lens error was caused by either dropping camera or by camera powering on while still in case, etc. The camera wasn't dropped and I kept it in a case with the battery out. It couldn't have powered on while in the case. Google search and you'll find this camera has a lot of \"lens error\" problem, which more than likely indicates its a POS that Casio doesn't want to take responsibility for.

You can even shoot videos while simultaneously taking pictures.  Your videos will have a little pause where you took photos but it works out pretty well.  The big problem I had was its build.  It feels cheaply constructed which is understandable at the price.  What wasn't understandable is a random lens error I had one week into having my camera.  Typically, lens errors occur when something is obstructing the lens from poking out in which case it retracts and tells you, but I had a lens error when I turned it off and the lens couldn't retract in.  It was stuck halfway so I gave it the slightest nudge to help out.  It worked out a few more times like that, until my light nudge would no longer work.  It would get stuck halfway and require more force, which is obviously bad for the camera but there was no other possible way of having it retract.  Maybe I just got a faulty camera because it never incurred any heavy blows or anything remotely close to damaging it but it is now unusable because the lens has failed.  Otherwise, I'd totally recommend it, so I'd suggest getting a warranty on this to be safe.", "Date": "November 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it!", "Author": "Elizabeth Licorish", "ReviewID": "R2G1X7EXYWEXBV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is delicious!

But we DO LIKE the ability to take a picture in the middle of the video though:) Love that this model can charge the battery outside of the camera and not on a dock anymore like my first model.

This also enables you to snap still photos while videoing.  3x optical zoom is actually greater for settings less than 10MP by utilizing the imager.  At 4 MP you actually get 4.7x before digital zoom kicks in, and 640x480 videos you actually can zoom it to 17.1x before digital zoom, as long as you have VGA size selected.  You may have nosebleed seats but your videos will look like they're taken from the front row if you can hold the camera steady.Picture quality is fine, battery life great, and unlike some other cameras at this price, it does retain it's time/date settings when the battery is removed.

The canon was built tough, not sure why it started to get a purple haze across the top of the pics but it's too much $$ to repair vs. replacing it. So I bought the ex-s5 last minute before we left for vacation. The pics are nice but it gets tricky in less than optimal light. Although it has the best shot or easy mode.....it doesn't always work like it's supposed to. Indoor receptions etc.. low light, I switch to sensitive instead of the actual low light best shot. The colors would be \"off\" at times and i usually do some slight adjustment to the color before printing them. The picture does come out clear even if you do zoom and crop so that's a plus. It is light and portable. I agree that the battery/card cover is cheap plastic so be careful. Overall, it served as a last minute replacement well enough, but in hindsight I think I might have looked for something a little more. i.e. 5x optical zoom and some sort of digital zoom with it.....also would've like a manual mode for quick pics without the \"lag\" for the quick shots", "Date": "December 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "One of the best!", "Author": "Renata Berni \"Re Berni\"", "ReviewID": "RNQ00ABZAZ563", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the fourth Casio Exilim that I buy and this is by far the best one!!

I love the fact that you can take a video, and while taking it, you can zoom and take pictures. I love the recording feature, where you can record a conversation. I love the start up picture and the sounds when you turn on the camera, and when you take a picture. I really like the fact that you can dub on the picture. Before I got my camera (about 3 months ago) I've been researching which one to get. After researching for a few months, and picked this camera, I have been so thrilled. My friend got the other camera that I wanted to get, the Fuji-film Z30. I was looking at hers and mine, and although I like hers, I like mine SO MUCH BETTER!! The only negative I found, although it is not so bad, is when taking a picture of/by yourself, I find the zoom button is very flimsy/moves very easily. So if I am taking a picture, in the middle, I might accidentally turn the zoom button and the picture will \"suddenly\" zoom in/out. But that is only a side complaint because it doesn't happen very often. I also like the feature \"Anti Shake\". If I am taking a picture and by accident move my hand in the middle of taking it, the picture will still come out clear!!

Finally a new one arrived. they were always polite on the phone and answered fairly quickly, didn't shuffle me around to different departments, but things didn't move very quickly.Because of the design flaw with the shutter, this camera should be carried in a small protective case and not just carried loose in your purse or luggage, or back pack, It will not knock the shutter off track and the camera wont turn on.", "Date": "July 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor photo quality outweighs all positive features", "Author": "oshow", "ReviewID": "RZZC6D51K6P63", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The title says it all.

I called and was informed that I needed to ship the camera along with a letter describing the problem via Fed Ex or UPS to their service department in California.

For a point-and-shoot, this camera has been nothing but a frustration.  The main complaint is that no matter which automatic setting she tries (typically Best Shot), it's very slow.  The subjects have to stand perfectly still while the camera adjusts, focuses, and then takes the picture...in all, a process that can take a few seconds.  Could be the SD card but I doubt it - we've tried multiple cards, all name-brand and reliable in other cameras.  Could be the settings - but we've tried other settings and noticed very little improvement.  Some low-light pics are very grainy, despite the flash.  I'm left to think it's the camera - we've had older model Exilim's and my wife LOVES their UI for browsing photos.  Also, I don't recall having any complaints about the picture quality of previous Exilim cameras.  This model may be a step up in MPs, but it seems to be a major step backwards in performance and overall satisfaction.The only positive I can think of is that she likes the color and still likes the UI for browsing photos.  Occasionally we luck-out and get a decent pic.Overall - a point and shoot needs to be just that - point and shoot...minimal tweaking of settings (if any), minimal wait, decent pics.
