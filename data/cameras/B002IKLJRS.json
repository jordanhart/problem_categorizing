I bought this one because it was a top rated pick at Consumer Reports. I am very happy. This has some of the same features and functionality of my previous model improved. It is easy to use. Very quick pictures. Small and easy to put in youp pocket. I love the intelligent auto feature. I would recommend this camera.", "Date": "May 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP8", "Author": "Lori", "ReviewID": "RTMB2LD261OHR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had it about a month now and I really like this camera.

It is relatively easy to use and has a host of advanced features that I never intend to use, at this time anyway.  Before buying the camera I read many reviews online.  The primary concern that the online reviews had, and that I noticed when I use the camera is that the picture quality in the  \"intelligent auto\"  mode is not as good as some other cameras.  What I did, as recommended by the web reviews, was to  adjust the normal picture mode to be at 800 ISO or lower.  Since it is very easy to switch between the \"intelligent auto mode\" and the  \"normal mode\", I will switch between the modes as I deem necessary.  It is not perfect but it is very good.", "Date": "September 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Buy the correct battery...", "Author": "Kindle Customer", "ReviewID": "R3F232SCFUY8CS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have only had the camera under a week and so far, it is a nifty little camera and I think we will enjoy it very much.My problem is in ordering extra or replacement batteries for it.

With all the bells and whistles on this thing, it is probably capable of higher quality photographs than it produced for me because I do not know how to select the right settings for this thing.A few weeks ago, a friend and I compared several photographs, me with this and her with an Olympus she purchased at the airport in 2004.  The sharpness and clarity of that camera was superior.  Did I have the correct camera settings?  Probably not.  Would the Panasonic have outperformed a 6 year old camera had the correct settings been used?  Who knows, because I never could figure out which settings those would be.This Panasonic camera was the highest rated in the compact digital camera by Consumer's Reports.  It out performed the Kodak previously owned, and previously the rated highest by CR in the same catagory.  All these cameras are complicated, and the general setting does not justify buying a new camera.", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$299.95", "Features": "12.1-megapixel resolution\n28mm wide-angle lens with 4.6x optical zoom; POWER O.I.S.\nCapture HD video at 1280x720, 30fps\n2.7-inch  TFT LCD screen\nCapture images to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Panasonic Lumix DMC-FP8 12.1MP Digital Camera with 4.6x POWER Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-inch LCD (Silver)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/317Y7QNJZUL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002IKLJRS"}}
