I was surprised by the number of features this little guy has. I have yet to try them all. The screen is large and easy to see. The functions are easy to access and the camera gives you a quick description of when to use them. Excellent quality for the low price. Highly recommended.", "Date": "October 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Decent camera for the price.", "Author": "sunposephiroth", "ReviewID": "R1YIS5A5ILF4V", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the camera in mid August and have enjoyed it for the most part. I takes pretty decent video, but sometimes picture quality can be pretty inconsistent even within the same settings. Be careful you're loading your camera battery in the right way, it'll click in backwards and make you think it's broken.", "Date": "October 17, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little Camera and easy to use!!", "Author": "Mark A. Lingle \"Amazon Rules!!!\"", "ReviewID": "R21GSGCSJHZDBI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My mother liked my Fujifilm camera so we went on Amazon and found one in Red. She needed something easy to use and she wanted one that used SD cards and had software to use on her windows computer. When the camera arrived she loved it! We took pictures right away as well as video. All came out perfectly and we even fooled around with some of the features and special effects! This camera is loaded with features and it would take a book to print them all! She is not computer literate \"a geek\" so to speak, but still was able to transfer the pictures to her computer and then to her digital frame for displaying. Great for day trips. She owns a larger, full size video camera, but liked the fact that this camera took video and she didn't have to lug the big guy around! The software included with the camera was FinePix and it was also easy for her to figure out and use! Hope this helps! For more technical information, I suggest going to reviews online. I can only attest to ease of use and the quality of the pics and video were top notch!", "Date": "January 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "Probably too much of a \"real\" camera for tweens", "Author": "Harry W. Reed", "ReviewID": "RM1GOXKQY9FZ4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was purchased for a twelfth birthday. It was chosen because of its price, its battery, and its abilities. The price was in a range for a major birthday present. I like that it has a rechargeable \"camera-type\" battery rather than AA batteries. My FinePix F70 exr has a better zoom, but this one was a fraction of the cost. The only problem we've had with this camera was operator error. Somehow a pin where the cable inserts became bent -- This is why I say that it is too much of a real camera for a tween. I don't know if she put the connector in wrong or if she carried the camera in a pack/purse unprotected, but the damage was done. This damage is not the end of the camera because the pictures can be downloaded by inserting the sd card into the computer and the battery comes out of the camera to charge. Otherwise it is a great inexpensive camera that is getting tons of use.", "Date": "April 29, 2011"}, {"Title": "Very Happy With Camera!", "Author": "lovetobuy", "ReviewID": "R2PLKW227SUCRD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Even in an auditorium it picked up great sound during video recording. I love that it waits till people smile to take the picture. My friends and I love taking this camera with us everywhere. It's so small but takes such clear pictures! A perfect everday take to the family barbeque type of camera!! Pretty color too. A really deep teal green. My previous camera was a Fuji too. I am very happy with Fuji cameras.", "Date": "January 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "Tremendous Camera", "Author": "Carlos Mancebo \"Caramand\"", "ReviewID": "R1HMCTPUR1NMGY", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This little camera is awesome.

It's AUTO SR (Scene Recognition - although not many) works fine and I particularly like it's Natural Light (N setting), as well as the N (with Flash) setting which takes both a Natural Light and a Flash Photo.  And amazingly, it's HD 720p video doesn't disappoint either, although one cannot compare the result with a video taken by a HD Camcorder.  Overall, I would say this camera is certainly better than those found on a mobile phone and it's small size makes it very easy to carry around as a convenient camera.", "Date": "April 20, 2011"}, {"Title": "video has high pitch noise", "Author": "beanrocks \"xbean\"", "ReviewID": "R2IX3BX7BXWV5T", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a nice little camera that taking decent pictures in outdoor or well lit area. I like the mode dial feature. Very convenient. It's light weight and compact. Very good for travel. The Li-on battery is sort of small that only last about 200 pictures. The built in flash is so weak that the picture is under-exposed even if the subject is within 5 feet. The 720P video is a nice idea. However, the video recorded has a constant high pitch hiss noise throughout, which is not acceptable. This problem was already mentioned in a early review. I should pay attention to it. I sent email to Fujifilm customer support and asking if they are going to fix the problem with a future firmware update, but got no response. So Fuji has no plan or interest to fix it. I end up return it.", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good buy", "Author": "babydust", "ReviewID": "R2XAXWH0TL4O47", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera, it's great for the price & the picture quality is great compared to my past Sanyo camera's which took odd pictures, the lighting/flash would never do right.

It's a wonderful camera and very durable. It takes great pictures in the dark. The only cons is that at about 5 months after owning it I noticed that the zoom part began to get a little hard to move, a week later it became almost impossible. Another issue is you can't move when taking a picture or it becomes very blurry and you can't make out the picture. After 2 months of not touching the zoom part it works okay.
