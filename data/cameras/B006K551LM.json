What prevents me from giving it only 1 star is it actually makes a decent on-the-go camera and camcorder (without optical zoom but complementing a smartphone without wasting the latter's battery life). I own two previous models of the Bloggie, one of which I bought from Costco a while ago. Compared to last year and the year before's models, the basic operations of this model (TS55) have not improved.  The touchscreen is still a pain to use, and (as is familiar to Android users) is not very responsive at times.  The Bloggie as a whole is still not very ergonomic, the button placement being really stupid.What really upsets me is the connectivity part.  WiFi connection is slow, but that's not its greatest sin.  At first I thought with this model I could simply upload the pictures and videos I took via my home WiFi.  Nope, the wireless connectivity here restricts you to just a handful of websites, plus Sony's own PlayMemories Online which as of today (May 17, 2012) is still not operational.  It sucks that this model does not support SkyDrive (where I get 25GB of free cloud storage; if you sign up now you'll get 7GB), or other popular photo sites like Shutterfly.  This Bloggie is poorly designed and has nothing that makes it stand out.", "Date": "May 17, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great hardware, but terrible software/firmware", "Author": "Just a guy", "ReviewID": "R20AUV8DYXOSYI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "This is a nicely formed still/video camera.  It feel good in your hand and the buttons feel high quality.  The screen looks nice and the sound is reasonable for such a small device.  The software/firmware is absolutely abhorrent.  The whole point of this particular camera is that you can attach to a wifi hotspot and upload pictures/videos to various services, including picassa and facebook.  I simply could not get it to work.  I was able to connect to a wifi spot in my house, and log into my various services but each time it tried to upload a photo or video it returned an error asking me to \"please try again later.\"  This happened across multiple services, mulitple different days, and over multiple different wifi connections.  Also, each time it needs to access the internet, it needs to reestablish the whole wifi connection anew.  Typing WAP passwords on the on-screen keyboard becomes very old very quickly.I was able to eventually upload some photos and videos onto my computer using the simple pop-out USB connector (same as a flip video camera).  The videos had good sound, but the picture quality of both videos and photos left a lot to be desired.  Indoor photos looked very grainy (the \"flash\" is nearly useless).  Outdoor photos lacked vibrant color, though much better than indoor photos.The battery seems to last a very long time - I did not encounter any low battery warnings after a full day of shooting photos and videos with limited flash usage.All in all, this might be a great camera with a firmware upgrade and some major bug fixes.  However, as it exists now, I would not recommend it.", "Date": "April 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Needs an Upgrade on some features", "Author": "joshua O'Neal", "ReviewID": "RFBFE6MNI99A8", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The only bad thing about this camcorder is that you cant pause while your recording, you have to press stop and start a new video .", "Date": "May 10, 2014"}, {"Title": "Updated Review: Acceptable noise, touchy wi-fi, Crisp Video", "Author": "Steplander", "ReviewID": "R89RYR9OPZDUI", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Updated Review:On the surface this looks like a nice camera. Compact, HD video and stills, and Wi-Fi connectivity to convenient sharing sites.There is good and bad.I originally felt there was a lot more BAD with this camera, but after additional testing I have given this camera a better rating.At this time the Bloggie cannot connect to Facebook: Trying to do so takes the user to a SONY web page that informs you that the Facebook upload service is temporarily not working and will not be available \"until December\". (Note, I am writing this in March.) The SONY rep I spoke with says they are currently working on this issue and the December Date is not realistic. He believes it will be corrected in the next couple of weeks. I have to mention, that Sony's customer service did help me through a few the problems I was having with set-up and function. This made the difference between me returning the camera and keeping it.Connecting and Uploading to my I-phone via wi-fi is a little touchy. When it works; it works fine. There are times when I am in areas that something, in the air, blocks the signal between the two devices. When it works this is a convenient feature. I bought this camera so I would not tax my I-phone with home video file bloat. It's nice to be able to grab a picture from the Bloggie via wi-fi and then edit the image using one the photo editing apps I have on my I-phone.Uploading to You-tube worked. I didn't run into any problems uploading a video to You-Tube and video appeared on the site in a minute.Connecting to Playmemories, the Sony photo/video upload site, worked well. The connection to the site was not always solid and uploaded images dropped about 25% of the times I tried. I can't tell if this is a wi-fi problem or a problem with the Playmemories site. Maybe I am missing a control feature, but I noticed that ALL photos and Videos upload to the site upon connecting. I would prefer that it allowed me to check images and videos for uploading.Recording LIVE video to the QIK web site, after an account is set up, worked really well. I was actually impressed at how easy this was.At first I was really disappointed in the fact that the focus ring creates a tapping noise that can be heard on the video. After additional testing I have found that the condenser mic hears this woodpecker-tapping sound when there is no other sound in the room. The mic opens up and listens for sound and the sound it picks up is the focus mechanism. I noticed that the tapping sound was not loud when other sounds were in the room. Considering I am using this movie for blogging and home vacation home movies, this tapping is no longer much of a bother to me.The video is very clear. The focus function is slow to react to subject distance changes. I would suggest setting up a shot if you can, tap the screen so the camera focuses on your subject and then start recording.At another Amazon customer's suggestion, I tested the recording length time:In HD, the camera stayed in record mode for 24 1/2 minutes before it stopped recording. It does not automatically start recording another file. You have to start a new recording manually. This isn't a problem for home movie recording, but it would be a problem if you're recording a performance, play, musical event or other lengthy topic where you would want the camera to keep rolling. If this is your need, get a bigger camera.While recording video you can press the snapshot button on the top of the camera and get some nice still-shots on the fly. I really liked this feature.The images are crisp but I feel the shutter speed is a little slow so, if your subject is moving, expect a little blurring.I used kept this camera in my pocket over the last few days and really used it. I recorded indoors and outdoors and, despite a few out-of-focus shots, I really got some nice clean, crisp video that I'm happy with.I wish SONY had allowed for a memory bump via a card slot.After getting the camera set-up on my computer, connection and image upload has been really easy. The files are compatible with all of my video editing programs and the video looks really nice when it's burned to DVD.For the money I spent, I couldn't find anything else on the market that offered what this camera does.", "Date": "March 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Smooth and Easy to Use", "Author": "Roxx", "ReviewID": "ROVJSW5VE8970", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Sony Bloggie Live(MHS-TS55) Video Camera with 4x Digital Zoom, 3.0-Inch Touchscreen LCD and WiFi Connectivity (2012 Model)When I opened the Sony Bloggie Live package and turned it on, I actually said, \"whoa.\" I could tell this was going to be an entirely new level of quality. Here are a few features:* 12.8MP still camera* 1080p supported (also 720p)* Built-in USB port* Built-in mini-HDMI portI use my recorder sometimes for trips and events, but mostly live music recording. For this, I think the Bloggie will do well. My favorite thing about it is the stabilization. It really makes videos taken when walking or in a moving vehicle quite smooth.Here are some suggested tips. I would recommend you put the wrist strap on as soon as you get near it, like a Wii control. If you have small hands, it can be a bit awkward, but you can get used to it. Your tripod mount is on the bottom, so you will have to mount it from the side.I spent 2 days with this camera intentionally not looking at directions, to see how far I could get. The controls are very common sense, there was very little to surprise me in the directions.The stereo microphones sound best between medium and loud levels.The touch screen is really nice, and the camera feels much like a phone.Youtube's SonyListens channel provides some great info, and at this time offers a promo code for Bloggie accessories!", "Date": "February 7, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good", "Author": "awesome head \"Cheese head\"", "ReviewID": "RF6GR7PXZPARK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great camera. It's exactly like a cell phone. It's a touch screen, has Facebook,YouTube, and other social networks. There's no batteries or SD card needed.

This time it has a touch screen and they say you can instantly load your videos and photos onto the website of your choice.I really like the touch screen feature. I found it really easy to navigate around. The thing I like about the Bloggie cameras is that they are pretty simple to use, at least to me, that I don't need to sit down and read pages and pages of directions to be able to understand how to work a product.The one big fail about the product and why I couldn't decide on whether or not to give this review 3 or 4 stars is the whole loading pictures and video to websites. I can't get it to load anything onto Facebook. Every time that I tried, it told me that an error occurred and to please try again later. That was a big letdown seeing as Facebook is the only place, at the moment, where I would want to load my videos onto. It's kind of bad when it seems that this is basically why Sony introduced this product.But to me the quality of the photos and video are excellent. The colors in the photos are vibrant. The video is pretty nice. I took video of fireworks at the Fourth of July and the sound and video quality is not bad. So it kind of stinks that I can instantly upload things that I record on this camera onto sites like I should, but I still like this camera.", "Date": "August 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great little camera.", "Author": "Amazon Customer \"geek girl\"", "ReviewID": "RQY6N76EWUPSE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We have been delighted with the Bloggie.

Every single part of it is well designed.  We were taking movies and still pictures within minutes of having it out of the box, watching them back on the small screen, deletiing---everything is so easy to use!  The PDF documentation stored in the camera is very clear and well written, if you even need it.  Unlike other small cameras I've tried, the still picture feature is great, and the pictures come out beauitifully, 12.8MP.  I can see this easily replacing my regular still camera.  We were able to view movies we took on Windows 7 even without installing the Sony software, but when we did, we found it great as well, very feature-laded.  We signed up easily for an account to be able to use the live streaming, and it worked perfectly with our Wi-Fi.  I can see my husband using this on business trips to stay in touch with us and show us the sights remotely!  I love how the camera finds faces.  It makes me feel like an experienced video camera users, when I'm not at all.  I'd say this is well, well worth the price.  We tried a slightly cheaper camera recently and it was barely worth using.  I'd pay the little extra for this one, because of all it does, and does well.  Highly recommended!", "Date": "April 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "Some good upgrades but not perfect", "Author": "J. Brooks", "ReviewID": "R2T8NCLP5MJCZX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Bloggie Touch that I previously owned was great, this new Bloggie Live is even better.Still shots are amazing with the Bloggie Live so long as you have adequate light. In low to moderate light levels it's not that great.Video shooting is flawless just like the previous version, one button and you're going. The biggest complaint I had and still have with the Bloggie, both Touch and Live, is it's autofocus is extremely slow and has a tendency not to focus on what you are trying to film. This was extremely apparent when I set it up on a tripod to film some closup handwork. For distance filming (10 feet or further) it seemed to work much better and again make sure there is adequate light.The addition of a single front mounted LED light (touch screen operated) gives it a bit more versatility in the lower light situations than the previous Touch Bloggie. This I am pleased with but it is by no means a substation to having good light.What I enjoy the most from the Bloggie Live is it's WIFI ability to connect with a multitude of online services (Facebook, YouTube, Picasa, and Flikr being the main ones). This saves me quite a bit of time having to connect the camera to my computer, download the pics, and then turn around upload them. This is something I absolutely love!The Bloggie Live is a good upgrade from the older Bloggie Touch, just that I find it extremely difficult to justify the cost for only a handful of \"convenient\" upgrades.", "Date": "April 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Shame on you Sony", "Author": "Bolialbo", "ReviewID": "RNAQ2GO3BR4VN", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "If you buying this camera only because of its wifi capability, DO NOT WASTE your hard-earned money on it, it will not upload anything to Facebook or YouTube as the product description clearly states, the video camera is ok, the led flash is pretty much worthless, Sony could've done a lot better, I'm very disappointed.
