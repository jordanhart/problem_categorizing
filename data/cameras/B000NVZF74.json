With condominiums, you are not allowed to mount anything outside of your domicile.  It has a very communist feel to it!!! I picked up several of these little \"eyes in the sky\" in an effort to maintain some level of security and surveillance.  I do in fact have some level of security and surveillance.  With minimal interference the picture can be actually quite clear.  I have to warn you, it's not very exciting!!!  Sometimes having a camera in the window sill, even if the cord is simply lying on the floor, is rather ominous and a great deterrent.  I prefer mine plugged in!  If I suspect trouble ...  I quickly connect to the VCR on slow play/record. It really helps keep the monkey business to a minimum.  Don't let anyone tell you you're paranoid!  Paranoia is simply total awareness!!!!!!!!!!!!! The quality does rate a lower price. If you're needs are like mine and it is temporary, furthermore lives don't depend on it, this will work for you. If you truly need the real thing, by all means spend the money and buy a hard wired closed circuit set. It does work though, I was incredibly skeptical at first. It was also incredibly easy to install.", "Date": "June 19, 2007"}, {"Title": "Unfortunate", "Author": "Johnny Ray Baker", "ReviewID": "R24U0414UR6YP", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Camera worked ok,the range wasnt quite what I had hoped.Unfortunately the signal interfered with my wifi to my laptop.
