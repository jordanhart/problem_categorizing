{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Solid ultracompact camera", "Author": "Garrett Lowenthal", "ReviewID": "R2K9UL6U2KU3HD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "If you need a solid, reliable, and stylish point-and-shoot ultracompact digital camera that produces high-quality images, then the new Canon PowerShot SD1100IS may be right for you.I am an advanced amateur photographer and own 2 Canon digital cameras (G2 and 20D).  Both have served me well over the years but recently I have found myself needing a decent ultracompact camera that I can easily carry with me at all times for unexpected photo-ops.Other current Canon models that I also researched before my purchase of the \"bohemian brown\" SD1100IS included the SD950IS and the SD1000.Here is my take on the SD1100IS:Strengths:- 8MP CCD sensor with DigicIII processor (excellent resolution images with good dynamic range)- Solid construction (most of body made of anodized aluminum)- Feels sturdy and well-balanced in the hands- Easy to use (logical user-interface) with minimal need to consult owner's manual for basic operation- Multiple shooting modes to fit variety of situations (action/sports mode is a glaring omission but read section below to see possibly why)- Advanced metering system with accurately exposed pics in even \"tricky\" situations (great balance of highlights and shadows)- Tack-sharp images (much more so with sufficient lighting and use of built-in flash)- Macro mode can result in stunning close-ups with outstanding level of detail- Optical IS feature helpful when shooting in either low-light conditions with flash off or at telephoto lengths- Fast start-up with acceptable shutter-lag (when not using flash)- Bright 2.5\" LCD monitor (100% coverage, 230k pixels) made of polycrystalline silicon; fairly scratch-resistant (can't vouch if this applies to keys and coins)- Optical viewfinder (though only a tiny peephole, it is essential when LCD glare and washout become an issue shooting in bright sunlight or when LCD cannot be used as battery power is nearly depleted)- Camera made in Japan (at least those from the 1st shipment; this easily may be subject to change)Limitations:- Lack of manual control over aperture, shutter speed, and focusing (for the obssessive control-freaks)- Noise is noticeable beginning at ISO 400 (ISO 800 still useable but probably for only 4x6 images; ISO 1600 mostly unuseable)- Fastest shutter speed is 1/1500 sec (not fast enough to stop action for some sporting activities)- Auto-focus speed inadequate to follow fast-moving subjects- Shutter-lag accentuated with flash on (precious Canon moments lost while waiting for flash to recharge)- Cannot adjust focus or optical zoom while shooting in movie mode (focus is fixed for distance selected at first frame, and digital zoom is permitted instead, resulting in significant image quality deterioration)- Battery/memory card cover and hinge made of plastic (no safety latch that needs to be de-activated first before sliding cover out, in order to prevent accidental opening)- Minor vignetting and chromatic aberration (albeit, difficult not to expect from compact p&s;)- Pincushion and barrel distortion at the extremes of the focal lengths- No RAW shooting modeBattery power in camera mode with LCD monitor on is mostly as advertised, allowing for approximately 240 images.  If your budget permits, I recommend investing in a few spare batteries as backups and replacing the supplied 32MB memory card with a pair of 4GB SDHC memory cards--vital purchases if you plan to use the movie mode frequently.Overall Impression:Even with some serious limitations inherent to virtually all digital cameras in this class, I am recommending the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS.  It does what it's supposed to do.  This camera allows one to take beautiful photographs in an ultracompact, reliable, and elegant device that is both easy and fun to use.[UPDATE: Since this review, Canon has recently announced 3 new ELPH models that will be released soon....in time for Grad & Dad's Day: the PowerShot SD770IS, SD790IS, and SD890IS.  All are redesigned 10MP digital cameras with Optical Image Stabilizer.  The saga of the MP race continues.  If the same sensor is found in these units as their predecessors and without improving the noise reduction technology, then adding a few more MP can potentially result in noisier images.  We'll have to wait and see.  The most intriguing of the bunch appears to be the SD790IS, which replaces the SD750 by adding the very useful Optical IS feature and showcasing flat control buttons.  Hopefully, the QC has been remedied on this unit as many consumers experienced the dreaded \"lens error\" nightmare.  The SD890IS replaces the SD850IS and may appeal to vacationers and wildlifers needing more reach at the telephoto end.  The SD770IS seems a bit curious as it may be in direct competition with the new SD1100IS (which is the natural successor to the wildly popular SD1000); it has 2 additional MP but the feature set appears at first glance to be nearly identical to the less expensive SD1100IS.  I would've preferred to have seen upgrades to the SD870IS and the SD950IS, but those will be rolled out undoubtedly later this year....conveniently before the Holidays.SD770IS: 10MP, 3X Optical zoom (35-105mm), 2.5\" LCD monitor, Optical viewfinder, ISO 1600, MSRP $299.99.SD790IS: 10MP, 3X Optical zoom (35-105mm), 3\" LCD monitor, no Optical viewfinder, ISO 1600, MSRP $349.99.SD890IS: 10MP, 5X Optical zoom (37-185mm), 2.5\" LCD monitor, Optical viewfinder, ISO 1600, MSRP $399.99.]", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "A terrific pocket camera", "Author": "Julie Neal", "ReviewID": "R26VN29PK5TUMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "As a travel writer I spend a lot of time at Walt Disney World, and Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs are the most common cameras I see. Families seem to love them, because they're so easy to carry and operate. About the size of a deck of playing cards, each of these \"pocket cameras\" really do slip right into a pants pocket, and their rectangular designs make them easy to grip. Best of all, they all take good photos. (How do I know? Because I've actually gotten to use every one of these models. Nearly every day guests ask me to take photos of them with their own cameras, which most often are Canon PowerShot Digital Elphs.)Here's my breakdown of the ten bestselling Digital Elph models. Any of the first six are superb choices:1ST PLACE: SD1100 IS (The camera on this page)An update to the SD1000 (see below), this 2008 8MP beauty adds image stabilization, a slightly longer zoom (38-114 mm), another MP of photo size and a small indent on the right side for a better grip. Plus it comes in colors! My daughter has a blue one and uses it every single day. During school days the image stabilization made a real difference in her on-the-bus shots. With that heavy of use hers has gotten scratched up a bit, but the marks are small and hardly noticeable.2ND PLACE: SD870 ISThe ELPH to buy if you want a wide-angle lens. Slightly thicker than the SD1100 IS, this 8MP model doesn't have an optical viewfinder which makes it tough to use in bright sunlight, otherwise there's little not to love. My husband uses one as a comp camera, to compose shots for the travel guide \"The Complete Guide to Walt Disney World.\"3RD PLACE: SD770 ISJust released in May, this 10 MP model is, in a way, an update of the SD1100 IS (see above). I rate it lower because it has a plastic body and doesn't come in colors. On the other hand, it has a longer battery life than the 1100 and features an improved LCD screen that is very easy to view. As for photo quality, I can't tell the difference.4TH PLACE: SD950 ISThere's a lot to like in this 12.1 MP camera. First off, it's gorgeous. The body, though a little thick, is titanium. An upgrade to the SD850 IS (see below), it has a 3.7x zoom lens and adds manual controls as well as the ability to stitch together panoramic images. The only reason I don't rate it higher is the price.5TH PLACE: SD890 ISWant a long zoom lens? Here's your baby, a 10 MP model with a 5x zoom. Also has the new bright LCD screen and all the other 2008 Canon goodies. The most expensive Canon PowerShot ELPH.6TH PLACE: SD790 ISWith the same 10 MP image sensor and 3x zoom lens as the SD770 IS, this new model stands out only for its larger 3-inch LCD display and, as a result, lack of optical viewfinder. The rear controls are different, too, with a flatter design that uses fewer buttons.7TH PLACE: SD1000In my opinion there's no reason to buy this 7.1 MP model. Released in 2007, it's been replaced by the SD1100 IS (see above). The SD1000 is a fine camera but it doesn't have image stabilization, a key feature of the 2008 lineup.8TH PLACE: SD850 ISThe ancestor to the SD890 IS, this 8 MP Elph combines a 4x zoom and 8 MP photo size with an image stabilizer. Every button, dial and switch has a quality feel. Slighter larger than the other models here, it is a little tougher to pop in and out of your pocket, but if you have larger hands it may be just what you are looking for.9TH PLACE: SD800 ISThis 7.1 MP predecessor to the 870 doesn't focus well at its edges when set at its widest angle. Still, it's good training for someone who wants to compose like a pro.10TH PLACE: SD750The 2007 PowerShot flagship offers a light meter that adjusts for facial brightness, 17 shooting modes, some first-rate movie features and red-eye correction -- features that were innovative a year ago but are common in Canon's 2008 models. No image stabilization; no optical viewfinder.", "Date": "March 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "Perfect for me.", "Author": "AZ Desert Rat \"movie buff\"", "ReviewID": "R1GP3A02RDXMF2", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been using a Powershot I2 IS for the last 3 years. Very good camera with a fantastic 12X Zoom.  However, I wanted a camera to carry in my pocket.  So many times I just didn't feel like dragging a large camera with me to various parties or events.  This camera fills the bill. I carry it everywhere.The pictures it produces are stunning. The 8MP 3X zoom produces a picture that you can crop to the point that you get almost the same picture as you would have with the 5MP 12X zoom lense (my opinion). The movie feature is wonderful too, even better than the I2 IS.The camera feels great in your hand with a solid, quality feeling.  If you have used Canon cameras before the menus are very intuitive. I would not have purchased this camera (or any camera for that matter) if it did not have the Image Stabilization feature.  This is especially a must as you get older.By the way there is an advantage to the Brown color: If you have to use the optical view finder outside, the camera itself produces minimum glare for you eye to see more clearly through the small opening. The color also makes the LCD playback pop.  And as a bonus, it really gives the camera a luxury look, you have to see it in person to appreciate the color.I recently took it to a monthly card party and everyone went wild over it. So much so that one person sat right down at the computer and ordered one!  If you want a sub-compact, pocketable camera that takes great pictures, I highly recommend the Canon SD1100IS.", "Date": "March 10, 2008"}, {"Title": "Amazon, Amazon, reviewers y'all, tell me which CanonSD is the fairest of all?", "Author": "AmazonDiva \"Keep Calm and Carry On.\"", "ReviewID": "R2U2NN8D67CP7X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First about the SD1100 and later in the review, a comparison between Canon SD series cameras.The former Canon PowerShot SD1000 7.1MP Digital Elph Camera with 3x Optical Zoom (Silver) was the perfect tiny camera that you could slip into your shirt pocket and bring out at a moment's notice and begin clicking away. No wonder it has been Canon's top selling model! It was almost perfect except it did not have image stabilization like some other Canon cameras. And now with the SD1100IS Canon has added it's motion detection technology to this tiny camera which will make your shots less blurry, especially in low light.Other enhancement over SD1000 is a slightly rounded styling which feels more comfortable in the hand and gives you a better grip. You can also choose from fun colors - Bohemian brown anyone?I have several Canon cameras and I use them regularly, but once again the  SD1100 gets a lot of use as it's easy to carry in your tighter jean pocket/shirt pocket.What else is nice about the SD1100 IS?Basic picture taking:It takes excellent outdoor shots and has a satisfactory low light performance for its size. The face detection and auto white balance in the frame help expose faces correctly. It has a viewfinder in case the sun is too bright and an anti-reflective 2.5\" screen. You can also use your high capacity SD cards in this baby.Creative features:With this camera you can get creative with \"My Colors\" features. The Color Accent mode where you keep any one color in the picture while the rest is black and white helped frame a blue sky, blue sea and blue jeans in a b/w group shot. Cool! There are options to swap colors and also take b/w or sepia pics. Read the manual and you'll discover even more fun features.The Scene modes are tried and tested and help you take the best picture. I love \"foliage\" which brings out the greens or autumn colors. \"Fireworks\" freezes the bursts of firecrackers in the sky in perfect spheres. \"Aquarium\" helped me take wonderful shots of fish, before this mode all I got was my flash reflecting on the glass of the tank. The others modes - indoor, beach, snow, kids/pets have been useful too.Making videos:The video mode takes movies in 3 different sizes and it has a time lapse video function. You can set the camera to record at intervals. I used it to capture sun's ascent from sunrise to mid morning and the video looks fabulous. You can even use the creative colors modes while taking video. The image stabilization helps in the video mode eliminating jerky shots.The bottom line? This is a great camera - it's take-along-everywhere tiny, it's got a ton of creative features and takes great pictures, it also comes in fun colors. It's the one to get!EXTRA READING FOR THOSE WHO ARE STILL NOT SURE...If you want the perfect balance between image quality, features, size, layout and last but not the least the price, here is my 2 cents worth. (I own 4 SD cameras and have done some research using all of these for the same picture at the same location.)Image Quality: Top slot goes to the cameras in the 800/900 series. The image quality of SD1100 is a notch below.Layout and controls: The controls are better on the 800/900/700 series compared to SD1100 as you have a separate instant replay button which is very useful to switch between shoot and replay mode. I LOVE this feature as it saves me a lot of time while shooting. It's so much better than the rubber slider on this 1100 model.Screen size: This camera has a 2.5\" screen with a viewfinder while some other models offer 3 inch screen but are missing the viewfinder. I prefer the larger screen as the extra .5\" makes composing shots much easier. I have NEVER missed the viewfinder yet, even in bright sunlight.Camera Size: SD1100 is the winner here as it's the tiniest. The SD750/770/790 are almost as compact but 800s/900s are bigger.If picture quality is important for you go for the 800/900 series. If smaller size, with nice picture taking capability is important look at the 700 series. If you want the tiniest, convenient camera which takes pretty good shots at a bargain price go for this SD1100.Note: For some additional thoughts click on the comments.", "Date": "March 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "perfect ultra compact model", "Author": "Mark Twain \"me\"", "ReviewID": "R2MPJ57ZA5AAK6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Brown)I own and am a huge fan of the Canon Digital Rebel SLR and think that it takes great pictures.  Unfortunately, there are times when a larger camera with all of it's accessories and lenses can be prohibitive.  In preparation for an upcomming event where I would be a participant as well as spectator, I realized that I would be unable to carry around my Rebel.So, I spent several days reading different reviews before deciding on the Canon PowerShot SD 1100.  I must stress that the fact that I already owned a Canon played no part in my decision.  I did not settle on the SD 1100 out of brand loyalty.  I must have read more than 30 or 40 different \"professional\" reviews of various cameras before picking this one.I have only had this camera for a couple of days, and haven't yet used it at the event for which it was purchased, but I must say that I am extremely pleased with this camera.  The most common negative comment in reviews of this camera is that it does not offer a wide variety of manual settings.  I have to agree that if you are looking for a camera to launch your career as a professional photographer, this may not be the best choice for you.The camera is ultra compact without feeling cheap.  It is well designed, well made, full featured, takes great photos under a variety of conditions and exceeds all of my expectations for a more \"portable\" alternative to my full sized SLR.  I cannot think of a single negative thing to say about this camera and I cannot imagine why somebody wouldn't be extremely happy with this purchase.I also recommend buying the case advertised as an accessory for this model as it has a belt loop that allows you to carry it safely and securely on your belt instead of in your pocket.", "Date": "April 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "READ THIS REVIEW...", "Author": "John P. Robertson \"whatever\"", "ReviewID": "RB1K3IHMOTJ89", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I can't say anything about the Canon Powershot SD1100 IS that hasn't already been said... but that's never stopped me before, and it won't now.First a tip; When shooting videos, there is a 4GB maximum file size. For this reason, I use several 4GB SDHC cards, rather than one larger one. That way, in the rare event that a card craps out, you're not sitting on the shoulder, you have a spare tire. And two 4GB cards are often cheaper than one 8GB.But understand that a 4GB card will hold well over a thousand photos at even the highest quality, so if you don't care about videos, just use your old, smaller SD cards. (but not the tiny 32MB one that comes with the camera... it's useless, and not heavy enough to use as a paperweight or big enough for a coaster).This is a decent little camera, compared to the competition at it's price level. It's popularity, and overwhelmingly positive customer ratings, attest to that.But nothing is problem free, and this complex product is no exception.It's inevitable that there will be a certain number of product failures and customer service problems... sort of like the ones I had with Amazon during the ordering of this product... multiple calls with promises but no resolution, made me want to smack my head against the wall. Giant waste of time, but that's how it goes sometimes.In their defense, they have done well on other occasions. I will continue to buy from them if they save me money, but my advice is to know exactly what you want before ordering, and don't even think about making changes to your order... it's like opening Pandora's Box, pandemonium will ensue.(slap forehead, denoting irony, and wring hands in frustration).I see complaints about the camera, and some are valid. But some are not, like, (paraphrase) \"It's too difficult to turn off the flash\".I don't see how it could be easier, unless someone invents a camera that you can change the settings by \"thinking\" or \"willing\" it to change. You press the flash symbol with your thumb to view modes (auto,on,off), press again to set preference... it literally takes one second, and is about as complicated as lifting a toilet seat... and much cleaner.However... I did not perform hands-on tests of multiple competitors of this camera to compare complexity and intuitiveness of controls, so all I know that this camera is not as simple as my old 3.3 megapixel Sony DSC-S75.It takes some time to learn dozens of features, modes, and controls. I am a computer guy, some (me) say a good one. I have MCSE, MCP+Internet, and A+ ratings. That means that I am both a software and a hardware genius, LOL.However, I can tell you that both you and I will have to show more than a little bit of dedication to learn all the tricks and abilities of this camera, and the more you learn the more fun it is. But the manual is 225 pages, so turn off Jerry Springer and start reading. It's worth the effort.Alternatively, just reset to full auto defaults and go to town immediately.This camera won't perform like a digital SLR, but SLR's don't cost $200 bucks and they weigh a lot more than 4.41 oz. I bought this camera to be able to carry it around in my pocket 24/7, and in my opinion you can't reasonably do that with anything even slightly larger or thicker... even the chunkier Powershot SD's are too big. Again, only my opinion.If not for that, I would have gone for the thicker Canon Powershot SD890 IS with the 5X ZOOM, which is also half again more expensive, of course.I read a lot of reviews on the internet before choosing this unit. I have had the camera for a couple of weeks. After learning the features, I spent a whole day burning it in... as I said above, I have two 4GB SDHC cards plus a 2GB SD card, and two spare Lenmar batteries in addition to the Canon battery that came with the camera. I smoked that sucker, continuous mode with flash. I took hundreds of pics and lots of videos, including the time-lapse variety, cool. I like it. Homey says five stars.ADDENDUM, after spending more time using the camera, possibly belaboring some earlier points;At this writing, about 93% of buyers give this camera a 4 or 5 star rating. Now, some of the complaints from the other 7% are valid, like the one that states that the color swap feature doesn't work very well (but who cares, really?)...But others are not, like the one that states that the time-date stamp doesn't appear until you print out... clearly, the time-date stamp appears very nicely when you review the photo in-camera.The PDF user's guide for any camera is readily available from the manufacturer's website for any camera, and you should read it before buying to make sure that the camera has the capabilities you're looking for.Also, it's a good idea to at least read the same information in the user's guide booklet that comes with the camera after purchase... something that some buyer's clearly don't do. And with the number of features programmed into this and any other comparable camera, you are bound to have difficulty if you try to wing it.If this review was of any use to you in making your buying decision, click YES below.", "Date": "August 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "The lens error problem is for real....", "Author": "D.

The manual setting allows you to different things like stitching multiple pictures if you're trying to take a wide scenic pictures, auto focus, video, etc. I really didn't know what to expect from this camera. I also own the Canon 30D but wanted something a little more portable. I had owned others but always had problems with my images (or my hands) moving too much. The image stability feature on this camera works perfect. When you point this camera at a person/object--one or more boxes come up on the screen to show you what the camera will focus on. This is very useful if you want to focus on objects that are either close to you or farther away. The boxes actually move if the object is moving so you can get a clear picture of them. I which I $1400 camera had this feature. I read the manual while on my flight to Rome and couldn't believe the feature this thing has. I made sure I had a couple of high capacity memory cards for this trip. Don't bother trying to take pictures in dark places using the flash. The pictures will come out dark. This is a common problem a lot of cameras unless you have enough flash power. When I used the video features of this camera, I was able to take some spectacular video inside several churches (dark inside)in Rome. The videos are stored on the memory card in .avi format. I actually downloaded these videos on my computer and pulled out individual frames. I bought an extra battery for the trip but never used it. This thing doesn't use a lot of battery power. I went a min of 2 days (350+ pictures) without charging it. Even then--I really didn't have to charge it. The menus are easy to understand and the camera allows you to adjust the video/audio quality so you can take additional pictures/video. I used Adobe Photoshop Elements 6 to put all my pictures on a DVD with music and narration and played it on a 32-inch TV. The results were better than I expected. I'm going to try and upload a couple of pictures from my Rome, Naples and Capri trip on Amazon. I uploaded the pictures on amazon and can tell you that the results don't do this camera any justice. You can email me--I'll send a couple of video samples that I took when I was in Rome. Please take the time to read the manual and take some sample pictures.

Sometimes menu response  has lagged a bit, which can be frustrating when your subject is moving faster than you are.I moved from a Canon SD20 so having an optical zoom is wonderful.

Even though almost a year older than the 1100, the 8500 offers a few attractive features: 1. a 4X optical zoom lens, with an impressive range of 35mm-140mm (the 1100's is 38mm-114mm); 2. marginally faster shutter operation and less lag time between shots; 3. the ISO settings are reassuringly located in a familiar place (under func menu rather than controller) for users who prefer to make the setting manually.The experts' reviews admittedly favor the 8500, though I'm convinced present consumers are overlooking two things: first, the raves were written early last year and cannot be compared to reviews for a newly-made camera with merely \"incremental\" improvements (as the model number suggests, the SD1100 is the successor to the SD1000, which was the direct and immediate successor to the extremely popular SD600); 2nd, the marginally slower shutter time of the 1100 (lag between depressing the trigger and getting a response) is the trade-off for the addition of a new feature, Motion Detection technology, which acts in harmony with automatic image stabilization to recalibrate camera settings when extra motion in front of the lens is sensed.  Finally, the apparent unpopularity of this camera is misleading since it comes in five colors and Amazon is treating each separately in its sales rankings (go with pink and save a couple of bucks).I went with the 1100 (in silver) for several reasons: 1. It's closer in size, weight and appearance to the ultra-compact, classic SD1000 than the rounder and slightly heavier 8500 (for the record, the 1100 reintroduces the \"softer\" edges of the 1000's predecessor, the SD600); 2. the new Motion Detection system compensates for any additional lag time, providing sharp shots of kids and pets; 3. it offers an improved screen-- PureColor II (a noticeable improvement over PureColor under both extremely dim and bright conditions); 4. the focal length is ideal for the \"people shooting\";  5. at 4.41oz it's an ounce lighter than the other new Canon releases, the SD790 and SD890 (each 5.47oz).

That's because it took me so long to decide which one to buy. I am a point and shoot type of person with a side of \"wanna-a-be\" photographer.  So, I wanted a camera with perks but easy to use.  So far I really like this camera.  My old one was a Nikon cool pix.I liked it well enough, though it was a gift so not personally choosen. Anyway, I dropped that one in the river. I really wanted a canon but was concerned about the lense errors I had read about.  I think it's just something you have to stay conscience of. I bought a case and I haven't had any problems.  As far as picture quality, it's pretty sweet.  I love the macro mode for close ups of bees and flowers and hummingbirds. However, it works great for regular pictures too. You can set it to where it makes chirping noises or barking when you shoot which is funny for kids. Also the video is really good. It only had 3x optical zoom which is another reason why I hesitated. But, I haven't found I miss it for how compact the camera is.  Even with the case it fits in my purse good. I would advise you use the wrist strap always b/c it is small and could slip out of your hands and then you would probably bump the lense and get the lense error. I got the blue one and I love the color - makes it easy to know it's mine cause most people have silver.  Oh yeah, I really like the different settings. It has a sunset, beach, foilage, snow, action, black and white, sepia tone, etc. I use the sunset setting every night to take a different picture of my lake sunset and it's beautiful.  I've found the battery life is fine, especially if you use the view finder instead of the screen.  The Nikon I had before came with a dock and tons of cords to charge it.  This one has a battery-only dock the gets plugged directly in the electrical socket.  Way better for everday use and trips. I've only had to charge it once so far and it's been over a month. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend it. Especially because it was at a competitor for $50 more.***I almost forgot: in order to view your pictures on the camera the switch must be set to view mode.  If you are concerned about the camera turning on in your purse, turn it to this mode and then push the power button off.

My Casio was ready in about half the time.2. Grainy images on screen for any nightime indoor shots.3. Severely under-powered flash - I thought I read some reviews that gave it an OK rating at 10 feet...try about 8 feet and you might be more accurate. Many flash shots were severely darkened by lack of light...and often the flash only covered a portion of the image leaving faces dark and everything else in the photo bright.4. Used it last weekend for a wedding - roughly half of the shots had to be thrown away...you don't get a lot of opportunities at a wedding. Things move along at their own pace. So walking down the aisle, every other shot was blurry, or out of focus.5. Face Recognition software worked sometimes, and other times drove me crazy as it would not lock in anywhere near the faces....I eventually shut it off.6.

It is small enough to carry in your pocket but has enough weight to prove it's quality, comes with a wrist strap to prevent dropping it, a memory card, battery with a charger, cables & software to get you hooked up to a computer & a photo printer, and manuals that give clear, precise instructions on how to quick start and then later delve deeper into the capabilities of this exceptional little wonder! Need more info?  Read \"solid ultra compact camera\" by Garrett Lowenthal. No one could have covered it better-his review was by far the most helpful. I love it-don't know how I ever did without it!*****Update: 9/15/08...Been using this camera long enough now to give more details! Extremely long battery life! But you may want to keep a backup charged for longer photo shoots. Depending on the size of your memory card, you can record like a camcorder! It will keep recording until the memory card is full! I've read that a 4gb memory card will hold two solid hours of video(?). Again, keep a spare handy because you will get carried away shooting everything everywhere! Printing pictures is super easy! If you don't have a photo printer or a computer with a quality printer, take it to any of the local Wal-marts, Walgreens, etc.. Pull the mem card from the camera, insert into the kiosk, make your choices. Burn your pics to a disk (save them) so you can reuse that mem card, if you like. It's that easy! Print out immediately or submit a three day order for .15 cent prints! These services also allow you to alter your photos before printing (borders, cropping, size, zoom in and eliminate extraneous background clutter-result is georgeous thanks to 8 megapixels, color or redeye correction that didn't happen during shooting-rare but it can happen, etc.). Point, shoot, keep or trash it and shoot again! Or, fill up your card and sort out the good ones later! It is so easy! I'm going to buy another one for my son! FYI: Consumer Reports, October 2008 (pg 33) rates the Canon Powershot SD 1100IS in the top three best subcompact cameras!  Will keep updating! Happy shopping!Update: 6/2012.

The features it offered were pretty neat, I really liked the option that focused on one color and made the rest of the photo black and white. Very neat. Now for the bad, my unit was slightly defective (I assume), all of the photos were slightly out of focus, resulting in fuzzy images. But most of the reviews of this camera rave about the picture, quality, so I assume that my camera was defective and an anomaly. The other issue this camera had was the delay between telling the camera to take a picture (i.e. pressing the button) and the camera actually taking the photo (i.e. the image is captured). The camera had about a 1/2 second delay between the two events. This sort of delay is completely acceptable if you are taking photos of adults who know to hold their pose. But if you are taking photos of 2-year olds, forget it. All you get are the backs of little heads. I guess it is possible that the delay in my camera was a result of the auto-focus defect. But then I went to Circuit City to compare my camera to theirs (to make sure it was defective), I noticed that the Sonys were far faster than the Canons. The DSC-W150, DSC-W170, DSC-T70, and the DSC-T77 all were noticeably faster than the Canons. All of these cameras though are more expensive than the Canon SD1100, some much more so, and they also require special Sony proprietary memory, which costs extra as well. But I must say, if you are taking photos of young children, I highly recommend that you try one of the Sonys.

However, I feel I should try and warn people about some quirks I noticed about this camera...Pros:First off, this camera takes impressive photos. Once you get the hang of its modes, you can take some truly amazing shots. I got a lot of compliments on my shots of Peru which had some amazing shots (y'know, that Machuu Picchu place)..other pros include:1. seriously compact size (so light you forget it's there), more than small enough to fit in your jeans pocket2. great lookin' - I had a brown one which people raved at3. amazing battery life - I never had to recharge once. I just did to satisfy my own paranoia. That includes a 4 day trek through the Andes by the way.4. Powerful flash5. Very cool editing options - you can change things to black and white or sepia...AFTER taking the photos. You can get rid of red-eye. It's sweet. And this is all in the camera before you transfer... ah, technology.6. You can digital zoom during video. (be realistic, you have to pay at least a hundred more for a camera that can optically zoom for a video)Cons:I had an SD600 from back in the day which unfortunately got KIA'ed after being accidentally dropped in water. However, the same limitations I noticed on that camera are still present in Canon point-and-shoots...1) Takes forever between shots. Sometimes you just get frustrated and push the button all the way thru despite the fact that the focus never wakes up. You are then rewarded with an awful pic. It seriously takes a full 3-4 seconds between pics for this thing to get ready and that feels like an eternity when you're trying to get shots of something that is fleeting.... i.e. a temple w/o people in the way, etc.2) Night time modes still suck. It is seriously tricky to get this to work - usually things are blurry or way too over-exposed. And yes, anything over ISO 800 is totally useless.3) Zoom is very limited. Sometimes you can honestly laugh at how weak the optical zoom is. But I have to say they've improved the digital zoom quite a bit from the 4 MP days.4) Dust noise is markedly worse - y'know those annoying spots you get from dust? I guess this is a side effect of having a more powerful camera but it can get seriously ridiculousAnd the elephant in the room is....the LENS ERROR. This is a defect unique to Canon and was truly a shock to me. I'm used to Canon's bouncing back from rainy days and being accidentally dropped. After using this camera ONCE at an outdoor wedding reception (with some dustiness inevitably ocurring) my 2 month old 1100 IS gave me a lens error 5 times within 30 minutes. Each time I had to remove the battery and start over.This is a serious flaw and frankly fatal for me, I ended up returning what I had considered up to that point, to be a pretty sweet camera. So for all buyers out there, be aware that if you find yourself in a humid situation (rainy) or a dusty situation (outdoor receptions, etc) your lens mechanism stands a risk of failing. If you google this, many many people have run afoul of this issue and have had to pay over a hundred dollars to get their less than 1 year old cameras repaired by Canon.

I own a 40D which isn't so practical to carry around for everyday use, especially with my battery grip on it!  I previously owned (a now ancient) S40 \"compact\" camera - which in comparison is not-so-compact.  The SD1100is is amazingly small and light in weight.  It features a viewer which I think will come in handy (and has) in bright light situations where the screen does little or no good.  The 2.5\" screen is plenty big, although noticeable smaller than the 3\" on some of the other models.  I think the viewer is worth the small trade off.  IS is also an invaluable feature especially with low light situations or non-flash moments.The main issue I have heard of with this series is with potential lens harm if the camera turns on accidentally while in it's case.  It's pretty hard to do since Canon has now made this on/off button flush with the body.  But, my best advice to avoid this situation is to make sure the camera is in play mode (vs. camera mode) when you put it back in the case.  This will prevent the lens from zooming out upon turning on.  I'm not really worried - this has not happened to me yet (well, in the month that I've been carrying it around . . . EVERYWHERE!)Navigation is easy to pick up on this one - quite different from my older S40, but easy enough to figure out even without reading the manual.  I do suggest buying a spare battery to have on you just in case, especially if you plan on using the video mode (which is really good) since it sucks life quickly from the battery.  I also bought a 8GB HCSD card and reader to go with it to make room for quick videos of my kid :-) and pictures, of course.Other than that, it performs like I expected.  The flash is not the strongest, but then, it's a pocket camera.  If you're looking for more strength from a flash, you'll need to go with external flashing - on a different camera as this one doesn't have that option.

I only had red eyes in about half the shots (which for me is great)There are a ton of different options as to how you can take your photo, (indoor, outdoor, beach, sunrise, color swap, fireworks, pets, kids etc etc) I thought this was neat, but according to my friend who is an artist, this is just a gag they use to sell more features. If you put your camera on \"auto\" it does all of the same things.I haven't experimented enough to say if this is true or not.I love the size of the screen - its definitely larger viewing then my old cannon however it still has a viewfinder - which i find important when owning a camera - sometimes in the dark, using the big screen is useless, you can't see anything on it, or sometimes when you ask other people to take a picture of you - they are not used to using a digital camera yet- this allows them to use the viewfinder like a regular camera and take a decent photo. Also if you god-forbid drop your camera on vacation and the screen breaks, you have a back up till you get home (i've seen this happen to people)Transferring photos to my iphoto program in my mac is really simple, just plug in and it goes!I have only played around with the video function a bit.

I have used many different cameras (Sony, Kodak SLR, Fujifilm etc) but needed a ultra-compact for daily job.  First, I would like to highlight some weaknesses:1) Mechanical Noise - whenever the button is pressed during photo taking, the motor starts working and there is some noise of adjustment inside.  It is clearly audible if you are using the viewfinder.  I wonder if it will shorten the lifespan of the camera?2) Tower of light - when you try to take a shot at night with low visibility, you will notice vertical \"tower of light\" from bright road beam.  Clearly, the ISO or IS cannot coordinate well.3) The shutter lag - if you are taking shots between short intervals with flash, the waiting time may be significant if you are in a rush.4) Weak flash - I simply cannot get a clear photo at night for a subject standing 10m away.  4m is reasonably ok.  On the other hand, apply contrary thinking for battery life conversation5) ISO 1600 - it is pushing to the limit and the noise level is too great to seriously put the photo into archive.  ISO 800 is bad enough while 400 is ok.6) Sensitive Mic - at night, the mic works perfectly but if there is 0.5m tailwind behind, you will hear hurricane during playback.  Of course, I am asking for the moon.7) 32MB - this is the joke for the day but without a memory card, you cannot even store 1 single shot.8) Short battery life - common problem faced by other DSCs.9) Face recognition - the menu describes chasing the faces by pressing the \"print\" button while depressing the button halfway.  Hey, our fingers are flexible but they are not yoga trained (yet).  On the features, I am impressed (besides the obvious DIS, slim and 8MB stories) with:1) Stitch assist - this is wonderful but i have yet to try out piecing them back via software provided2) Color switch - wonderful to highlight specific subject3) Viewfinder - Yes, many are omitting this feature to cut cost. But this is the only way to make your battery lasts 2 times longer (in the event you forgot to take extra battery).4) Video - Try it.

Do", "ReviewID": "R2KZDA4AXU0K4X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's been years since I purchased an ultracompact digital camera for myself. I got a few cameras for friends and family as gifts but I decided that it was about time to get a new one and retire my old Sony Cybershot. After days of research I found that I liked the image quality of Canon, so it was just a matter of choosing the camera with the features I wanted. Ultimately the research led me to the PowerShot SD1100IS. An after-Thanksgiving sale at BestBuy got me the camera, an extra battery, a case, and a 2GB SD card for only $150. So after having used this camera for a couple months now, here is what I can say about it.First, the good:  - Stylish, small and light. It really is an eye catcher, especially in the colors offered. Canon isn't known to make the slimmest or gimmicky cameras, but I still had people complimenting it. It's small enough to fit in my pocket without being uncomfortable or bulgy.  - Image quality rivals some dSLR shots. The lighting conditions don't even have to be ideal and I have still managed some amazing shots. I'm sure the optical image stabilization has a lot to do with it, but the colors captured just seem more like what my eyes really see. I'm not anywhere near professional, and yet this camera manages to make it easy to take good photos. I've found that I rarely if ever need to go to Photoshop to make color and contrast corrections anymore.  - Along the same lines as above, the built-in red-eye correction functionality works amazingly well. This probably isn't a new feature on most cameras, but I haven't had a new digital camera in years. I found that the red-eye correction worked far better than Photoshop's eye color tool.  - Facial recognition is scary accurate... when conditions are right. More on that later. I even tried pointing it at a magazine rack in the bookstore and it put boxes around the faces on the covers.  - Fast shutter speeds and startup times. It's ready to go almost as soon as you turn it on. I've managed to turn on the camera and snag a couple shots of a speedy chipmunk in my backyard before the critter can scurry away.  - Has an optical viewfinder. Never again will I strain while staring at the screen in the outdoor sunlight.Here are the negatives that come to mind:  - Either there are no manual exposure controls, or they're hidden in such a way that I can't easily find them.  - Small-ish screen. It's the same size screen as my older Cybershot, and I can see that Canon has released ultra-compacts with bigger screens. Not too big of a deal for me given that the optical viewfinder takes up some of that valuable real-estate on such a small camera.  - It's really more of a nitpick, but the facial recognition works well only if your subjects are mostly facing forward eyes visible and their heads aren't tilted too much. People with sunglasses, or hair obscuring their eye won't be picked up from what I've found. Doesn't work at all with a sideways head.I've taken so many more photos with this in the past 2 months and I almost never have to do any post-processing to make my shots look better now. It's small enough to go with me almost everywhere. It's great for when you're going out and hanging with friends, to major events, family gatherings, and parties. I put the most mileage on it during Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years Eve, as well as a wedding recently and the photos turn out great. It also takes decent enough videos, at least for uploading to Facebook.

I also love the movie clip feature and the large LCD screen (which I miss in the XT). I bought a case for it with a neck strap so that I don't have to carry it when I'm empty-handed. The downside of the camera is that I'm used to having an SLR with virtually no shutter lag, so it's hard to go back to having a camera with it. That means that I have to be careful when shooting moving objects so that they're always in the photo (which sometimes becomes an interesting dilemma). Although the camera has a slow shutter speed setting you can't really adjust the shutter speed. There are set features for kids and pets, night shots, foliage and even fireworks, but you're pretty locked into the shutter speed they select.

Carbone", "ReviewID": "R15XCG1LTUVERW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Now that Canon and its rivals are offering numerous compact and ultracompact point-and-shoot cameras in the 10-12 megapixel range, the price on this 8 megapixel unit has dropped dramatically. But don't be fooled by the notion that more megapixels is better -- in this class of camera, it's not necessarily true. Unless the sensor is larger, which it generally isn't, you will often not see any difference in the 10 and 12 MP cameras. In fact, you might get more noise. You are also likely to get a longer delay between shots. So if you are buying a high end digital SLR, sure, go for 12, 14, or now even 16 megapixels. But for a point-and-shoot compact, 7 or 8 MP is more than adequate.This model offers 8 MP, face detection, and a variety of shooting modes that can be easily selected from a menu. It provides excellent results for everyday photography. It is also extremely compact and easily fits in a pocket or purse. If you want a camera to take along wherever you go, this is a must-have. It's also an incredible value, now available for as little as $160-$180.If you buy this camera, note that it only includes a 32 MB memory card, which holds roughly 10-12 photos. You will certainly want to purchase a good, fast card. The SanDisk Extreme 4 GB works great and will hold over 1000 photos at the highest resolution (1800-2500 at lower image settings). You can now get one for $30-$45.  Also, you may want to get an extra battery. Lenmar makes a good Canon equivalent that you can get for about $10. (Beware of no-name knockoffs that cost $2 or $3!)Overall, excellent ultracompact point-and-shoot camera. Get this item to have with you all the time.

Since this is out of warranty I'm going to try some of the fixes recommended on the internet, but I'm not hopeful.In general, this has been a great camera. As with most compact point-and-shoots, it struggled in indoor or twilight conditions when not using the flash, but it took fantabulous pictures in the outdoors and in reasonably well-lit rooms. The flash also worked well in terms of properly exposing most shots indoors. I also appreciated that the video quality (VGA video with monoaural sound) was pretty good for a camera of this generation, and the sound was clear. The camera video adjusted well to lighting conditions with a slight delay. You can't use the optical zoom once you've started recording.If I buy a new camera, I'm going to get something with a bigger zoom (7X or 10X), HD 720p video, and the ability to use the optical zoom while shooting video. If the camera performs as well as this one in other areas, I'll be pretty happy. I would lean towards Canon if I hadn't just experienced this \"lens error\" problem, which I find annoying.**************************************Original review *************************************** Just got this camera for a vacation trip (before the big price cut! bummer.) Spent the last two weeks taking well over 1000 photos on a 4GB card. Have never had my own digital camera before, but have used my friends' cameras and also purchased a Canon A630 for work about a year ago and use that occasionally. Basically, I'm the kind of user who never really wants to \"think\" about the picture I'm taking and expects the camera to figure out the right settings so I can just press the d--n button and get a great shot. Thus the Auto-mode on a camera is 10 times more important than all the \"scene mode\" options, because 95% of the time the camera is going to be on auto, and by the time I remember that a scene mode might be more appropriate, it's too late anyway.From that \"lazy novice\" perspective, this is an awesome camera. It did almost all the thinking for me, and just allowed me to point 'n shoot. People, buildings, boats, skies, ocean, insects, sand, friends -- pretty much everything came out without any adjustment.Comments on pics: I'm slightly red-green color blind, so I can't comment on the color fidelity of the shots, but these are all adjustable on the computer afterwards anyway. Focus was fantastic, with two exceptions: once when I needed to pick one non-centered boat to focus on in an array of boats at various distances, and I hadn't bothered to learn how to pick and lock focus from the manual. And should have used the \"infinity focus\" lock to take pics/video of a show in a dark theatre where flash was forbidden and the auto-focus assist lamp couldn't find the stage 50 feet away. This was the only time I got a series of blurry shots. I did use the \"night snapshot\" mode a lot to take pictures at night. That was my one concession in my expectation that the camera figure out everything. A couple times I turned the flash off because the flash was too close to someone's face and kind of flattened his skin tones and natural shadows.I also want to point out that I have very unsteady hands, and I made little or no attempt to keep the camera still when I was shooting. Not sure whether the image stabilization feature or the high ISO capabilities kicked in here, but I very rarely got a blurry shot unless both the camera and the subject were in rapid motion. [Update June 2009: I finally figured out that when I'm shooting people in motion (e.g. daytime street scenes) I just need to turn on the \"kids & pets\" scene mode, and then no more blur...] Very happy. And never saw significant noise in my photos, although I'm not particularly sensitive on this issue.Comments on ergonomics: small camera, lighter than my smartphone, fit into pocket. Pretty easy to hold in one hand and take photos. Slightly slick surface left me worrying that it would slip out of my hands, so i often used the wrist strap.My one wish has to do with the zoom range of the lens: it's not very wide at one end, and I often found myself inconveniently backing up to take pictures of houses. And the 3X telephoto end won't get you close up to that sea otter you spot out in the ocean surf. The Panasonic Lumix TZ series is fantastic in both of these areas, but I really didn't want to sacrifice the Canon idiot-proof simplicity, compact size, and great auto-focusing capabilities.Comparisons to other cameras I've used or played with: It's faster and smaller than the Canon A570IS I bought for my parents 6 months ago, although the A570IS is easier to hold steady because of the big grip. Personally I would have preferred to use AA batteries like in the A570IS, but the battery life on the SD1100IS is great so far and the charger is tiny and light, so easy to pack for a trip. I think the IS image stabilization feature is critical for shaky hands and casual on-th-go one-handed shots, which gives it an advantage over amazing cameras like the A630. We use the A630 at work to photograph everything from building problems to new member portraits, and it's great but heavy as a brick and triple the size of the SD1100IS. I do love that articulating LCD screen, tho'. It was impossible to take discreet snapshots of people on the street with the SD1100IS -- chalk it up to pointing a pink camera in their direction, directly at eye level. With the articulating LCD you can pretend to be just fiddling with the camera while getting great spontaneous shots of your friends.All in all, a brilliant camera for someone who really does NOT WANT to learn about technical issues of doing photography. Plus, at the current price it's a total steal, over fifty bucks less than I paid at the camera store just three weeks ago, and that was on sale!", "Date": "September 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon 1100IS is Tops in a compact pocket digital camera", "Author": "Bob \"N6BOB\"", "ReviewID": "R3DFE33GWSNZFV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just returned from Europe and took over 1500 images and videos with the wonderful camera. I have a neck strap and keep the camera handy my my chest pocket. This works so smoothly. When wishing to grab a quick shot I just pull it our and is seconds it is on and ready to take a picture, video, or record audio.  The face detection works well and if the shutter is pressed half way down the face will be highlighted and sometimes enlarged to show you where the focal point is. The exposure will be on the face most of the time so if the back ground is bright you will have a properly exposed face. This works especially will if the person(s) are close to the camera. I have taken some beautifully exposed faces all over Europe under some difficult lighting conditions... back light or total darkness.  The image stabilization really helps in dim lighting like in museums where you might like to take photos of art hanging on the walls. No flash is permitted so the IS really helps. In large churches that are often dimly lit one can rest the camera further on a bench or stable surface for further help with long exposures.  I took and extra battery and swapped it out every 4 days or so to keep the battery always ready for a shot. This worked all but one time when I took about 200 shots and a few videos and ran out of battery.  The Amazon price is one of the lowest I've seen. In Europe they are about 225 to 250 Euro or about 300 to 400 American dollars, so we get a very good deal here.  The 2 Gig memory cards work fine and store a ton of information. I recorded picture tags with the camera to place audio clips with the photos at concerts, family reunions, travel directions and friends voices  telling stores.

This camera turned out to be the perfect choice for me. It is so small it can easily be carried anywhere. The photos are not as good as those from my SLRs, of course, but they are excellent, nonetheless. The point is, I can take this camera anywhere for any occasion and get the shot, whereas I can't and won't do that with the pro equipment.There are several features I especially like, including manual controls, widescreen mode, time-lapse movie mode, macro mode and a remarkably useable digital zoom. The camera has enough manual controls to satisfy my need for tweaking, especially since I usually prefer the lowest ISO possible with flash forced 'off.'  When I shoot in widescreen mode, I can view the photos on my 16x9 widescreen TV and they look great. As a matter of fact, I'm shooting in 16x9 widescreen format pretty much all the time now because of this capability. Digital zoom has changed--no longer do you get blocky images from the camera's blowing up a portion of the sensor's image. Due to the sensor's high megapixel count, the blown up portion no longer looks pixelated as in previous models. It's like having a telephoto lens inside the camera to get those shots at the rare times when it's needed. Macro mode performs so well that flower photos rival those from my SLRs. The camera also has an excellent movie mode, including a fun time-lapse feature.Previous Canon sensors on P&S; cameras were 'use at your own risk' when shooting above ISO 100. This camera's sensor has improved considerably by providing what I would call 'very good' photos at ISO 200, 'good' photos at ISO 400 and 'acceptable' shots at ISO 800. I use noise-reduction software to clean up photos, anyway, but I'm pleased that Canon has improved their sensor and in-camera software.Couple all of these features with IS, which virtually eliminates shaking and blurry pictures, and Canon has another winner on its hands.

I also invested in a second battery which has come in handy on vacation when it's not always easy to find time to charge a single battery.I only have a few minor complaints about the camera so far. First, the 32MB memory card included is a joke. No store even sells memory cards this small any more so investing in at least a 1GB card is a must. Secondly, the camera does have rather flimsy plastic doors for the battery/memory card and the AV outputs. The cover for the AV outputs is also a little awkward as it doesn't open fully.

Because I see so many people here describing the SD1100 as an upgrade to the SD1000 - with the only differences an added megapixel and image stabilizer - So I would like to bring to your attention the rest of the differences and improvements, which can help your decision.The SD1100 has many improvements over the SD1000. It has FINALLY a battery meter which is a recent welcome addition in Canon cameras. It has the \"LP\" mode for video, which doubles the time you could record video, at almost the same quality (640x480). So in the SD1000 on a 2gb card you were limited to 16 minutes, and in the SD1100 you can have 32 minutes. That's also a welcome addition for Canon which only let's you record on uncompressed AVI format - not MPG like so many others. You can still not use the OPTICAL ZOOM when recording video.The zoom range is also different. The SD1000 was a little more \"wide-angle\", and the SD1100 zooms in a bit more.The face detection technology is also improved, by applying the strength of the flash according to the face it is recognizing, so it's should not overexpose.For you guys who still doesn't have a clue what the SD1000 was bringing new, let me repeat in short (of course everything is included in the SD1100 as well). Face detection technology; in camera red eye correction; 2:3 guide for 4x6 prints (you know where it's gonna get cut-off); settings and menus are much better designed than previous canons (you could see more selections on screen); and much more.I would also like to mention that pcmag.com has a review on the new SD1100, but they say that the older SD1000 (which was a \"editor's choice\" since arrival) have better picture quality than the newer SD1100 - So that the new 1100 is not worth upgrading from the SD1000.Hope my information will help someone.", "Date": "March 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "lens error", "Author": "S.

So, about 3 years later the 'perfect storm' happened.  1)  We used it to take family photos at Christmas with more care [even used a tripod and planned shots] than we ever had before.  2)  My SD port didn't work on my laptop, so the usual \"just in case\" backup of pictures didn't happen before we drove home  3)  Last but not least, our van got robbed for the first time ever while the camera sat in the 'catch all' basket [for the first time ever] overnight.  Perfect Storm.  Miss the camera.  Heart broken over the pictures.A few weeks ago I was right here looking at the SD1100IS camera again wondering if I should buy it again just because of how good a camera it was, or buy newer.  I noticed a USED tab and saw this camera in \"good\" condition for sale at $48.  Never purchased something USED on Amazon.  Read about the \"A-Z Garantee\" and all that mess, but really knew I was probably rolling the dice for 50 bucks.  I did it.The USED Canon SD1100IS showed up two days ago.  Looks like it's been to Hell and back.  Scratched, dented, paint chiped.  Ours was the opposite; always in a soft case and looked like new.  This one looked like it had spent it's life floating around in a purse full of keys...and angry birds.  LOL.  Well, it worked perfectly.  Not only does it worked perfectly and take great pictures, just like ours did...but it made me realize all over again what a great camera this is.We don't use 90% of the features of any of these digital cameras, but if you just want a solid performer then this is it.  I never knew how tough this camera was, because we took good care of ours.  Buying this used one shows me they can take a beating and still offer the same quality in function.Thanks for listening.*********************Updated Comment from Aug 2012 - The other 'used' camera came with an extra charger and memory card we didn't really need - sooo, I had an idea. My soon-to-be 15 year old needed a camera so I found ANOTHER of this exact same model USED on Amazon from \"KEH Camera\" - and he had good reviews so I took a chance with another $53. This newest used camera is in as good a condition as our stolen one was! Anyway, my kid is not the MOST responsible, so I'd rather her lose a $53 camera [that takes pictures like a $300 camera], than lose a brand new $100 camera that takes pictures like a $100 camera and eats batteries. :)*********************Update 8/6/2013 - One year later.  Was going through old reviews and decided to update this on the 'crazy' chance somebody reads them.  Both of those USED cameras are still doing great.  Total investment of $101 dollars for two cameras originally costing $250+ each.  Oddly, I've noticed a few folks with newer cameras and these old Canons are still as good or better.  If you are trying to decied whether to traverse the confusing landscape of what camera to invest in, I recommend looking at the \"Used\" tab on Amazon product sights - verifying the 'trustworthy' vendors that are Amazon certified - and considering trying a used/refurbished camera first.", "Date": "February 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "AWESOME PICTURE COLOR QUALITY!", "Author": "Doll Face", "ReviewID": "R3AR30X2N5W3UM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned many brands when it comes to point and shoot cameras (samsung, olympus, nikon).. and let me tell you this is by far the BEST camera I've owned. I recently just purchased the samsung tl225 which is suppose to have pretty amazing picture quality (NAH, I returned it) -- truth be told -- nothing beats a CANON camera. The reason why I am so reluctant to buy any other brand is because every other brand has the white/dull/pinkish picture color quality to it that makes everyone's skin look white and washed out in every picture. I have pretty fair skin so I like to look a little tan in all of my pictures (specially winter time). Fortunately, THIS CAMERA does NOT have the washed out picture problem because it can make even a sickly pale person look good! This camera captures the natural color of your skin tone and the natural color of images in general. I love canon picture quality and I would recommend every one (especially people who LOVE taking pictures and love posting pictures) to purchase this camera (or one very similar to it like the sd1200).CONS:1). It does have a flimsy latch for the sd/battery portion of the camera2). Over time the paint will start coming off the sides of the camera3). video quality is only okay (can't take it to concerts and expect super awesome quality) .. if you are looking for a camera that has good video quality.. I would NOT recommend this camera4). You have to watch which settings you put your camera on before taking the picture/going out because the picture quality will be different (auto vs manual.. etc)5). when you don't use the flash the picture quality diminishes .. even on macro settings6). outdoor pictures can sometimes be blurry7). taking pictures while moving without flash/light comes out BLURRYEven though, there are a few set backs (which almost every camera out there will have)... I still LOVE this camera due to its RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME PICTURE QUALITY! It makes my skin look flawless with a nice little sunkissed-tan look all year round :) Also, I've dropped this camera many MANY times and yet it still works just fine. Sadly to say, I've gotten some water on this camera (not too much water but more than a few drops) while going out at night with friends .. and it STILL works just fine!I AM ALL ABOUT THE PICTURE QUALITY because in the end that's all that really matters. The reason why I am not giving this camera 5 stars is because I choose to believe there is a camera out there that has a combo of canon powershot picture quality, combined with samsung tl225 set-up/model with a touch screen + LCD in front + samsung tl225 functions that doesn't cost more than $500. Now, THAT camera would be worth giving 5 stars to.Side tip: I've had a few \"lens error\" come up on the camera but after I popped out the battery and put it back it in, it always fixes itself.Side tip for ladies: If you are anything like me.. a lady who appreciates another lady with lovely/flawless make-up on her face.. this camera is FOR YOU!

There are certainly trade offs with low light performance and ability to control all the aspects of taking a photo, but that isn't what this camera is for anyway.  Save youself some money and get this instead of getting the latest camera with the highest MP count.  It seriously doesn't make a difference for what you are going to use this camera for anyway, and infact may hurt low light performance (more pixels packed into the same chip size generally equates to more image noise).Personal favorite features-Very light and sleak design-Nice LCD screen-Refined user interface-Decent low light performance-Optical stabilization (helps sometimes - but remember this just helps in holding the camera steady, not in increasing the shutter speed to catch a moving object in low light - like my always on the go daughter).-Good quality videoWish list- Ability to turn the flash on/off in auto mode.  This is probably my only gripe.  I use it in auto most of the time, but you can't make it use the flash for fill lighting or motion stop unless you go to manual mode.  I always have to flip back for my wife afterwards :-)- better default compression on the video.  This is a common problem for this camera segment.

In fact, I lost it on a camping trip and I am back to buy another of the same model.I am an artist who sells hand-dyed yarn on the internet. Getting true-to-life color is essential. I had purchased a point and shoot Sony, 1 year before, that cost twice the price of this Canon. The SONY did not capture enough red to even be corrected in PhotoShop properly for my needs.I take a lot of still photos of textiles at a close up, to place images on the web. I take a few for print, but mostly web.I also take photos of children, musicians and dancers. The Kids/Pets feature sounded good for this function when I ordered. It is good outdoors in full light.Taking photos of musicians or dancers on a stage is still a blurry experience much of the time. I realize that is a hard job for any inexpensive camera... but my old 2004 Kodak EasyShare had a sports setting that was incredibly good (fewer pixels probably helped it).I still take that 5yr old Kodak to my troupe's dance concerts instead of this Canon. (For the record, the 2 yr old SONY was much worse at dancer shots than even this Canon, no doubt because it did not have Image Stabilization. Normal photos of people sitting were even a problem on the SONY.)Pluses: good screen, weight, size, long battery life, excellent color that can be corrected to nearly-perfect (for web) via PhotoShop. Great closeups/macro.Down sides: A little too blurry no matter what setting I use, in bright/dark contrasting stage environments with moving subjects. Button for delete too close to the OK button (don't ask me how I know). Button for OFF too close to the shutter button.Also the Canon menus are much more confusing than they need to be. This one is a little better than my hubby's 8-year old Canon but not good enough. Kodak has menus in English, though their photos aren't as good as Canon's. I've taught computer classes for years (now just part time) and the Canon menus can confuse me, though I've used menu systems for decades. Pity a grandma who wants to do anything but point and shoot.I sure wish there was a setting for making the default to NOT flash unless I tell it to flash! Every time it powers off, it turns on the flash again, and that is no good for textiles or candid photos of children.I have had it give me the lens error message a few times when I tried to turn on the camera with my fingers on top of the lens/zoom area. I just turned it off and back on with fingers out of the way, and it has always responded properly.Over all, this is perfect for my work and for carrying in my purse to take reporter-type shots for my blog.

Some others I considered were the powershot A590IS & SD770IS, and Sony W150.I chose the SD1100 IS for the SD card compatibility, the small ultra-compact size which I think is great for everyday point & shoot, Canon's reputation in digital cameras, optical stabilization, the 230K pixel \"pure color 2\" LCD, and the relatively inexpensive price, 139$ new. Retailers are charging different prices for different colors, which I think is ridiculous.The 2.5\" LCD is plenty big enough on an ultra-compact, in my opinion. There's a trend in digital cameras to replace the optical viewfinder for a larger (2.7 or 3.0\") LCD. Now for the included 32MB SD card...really Canon? Give me a break! If you must include one make it at least 1GB, please. Otherwise save the half cent you spent and keep your 32MB baby. Personally, I picked up an 8GB SDHC Kingston.I recommend picking up a 2nd battery for a backup. Unfortunately, the Lithium-Ion battery Canon chose for this camera isn't the best. I got a Lenmar, cheap. Battery charge time isn't too bad though @ 1.5hrs. Also, a small case if you don't have one.I have a few minor con's beyond the battery- appearance wise I really wish the sides were color coded instead of black, optical zoom should be at least 5X, the black plastic mode slider should be some sort of metal button as this gets used often, and the non-locking battery cover is flimsy (handle with care).The 8MP size is perfect for my needs. The megapixel war, with digital cameras featuring 10, 12, or 14MP is just overkill for most ppl. Unless of course you are a pro photographer that need the ability to massively blow up and crop photos.

No viewfinder was a pain outdoors. The LCD went through batteries. I think that the 6MP exceeded the resolution of the lens optics. The lens had some dirt in it which showed up in bright pictures when the iris stopped down some. I was not so sorrowful that the wrist strap was not really around my wrist when I reached out to shoot down the cliff. I recovered what was important: 2GB SD card, so I lost no photos except those I was unable to take later for the lack of a camera.This Canon is only 3X optical zoom, though I think digital zoom (12X total) provides better quality than using Photoshop to do an equivalent digital zoom of a 3X optical shot. The Canon integrates the optical and digital zooms nicely. The Canon is engineered by a camera company. I trust Canon more for that than Panasonic, especially optics.The Canon is really small. I carry it in my pocket all the time. It takes far more pictures on a single charge than the Panasonic ever did on a fresh set of alkyline AAs. The Canon has fewer special modes; e.g., \"baby\" mode, which is miss a bit. (I'm a relatively new grandfather.) It has a few modes the Panaconic didn't have. These modes are a bit gimicky, but there are times they might be useful.Offline, the Canon has a red-eye reduction function. Being on a camera, it is a bit awkward to use, but it does a very nice job. I prefer the job it does to Photoshop Elements.The camera knows which way is up. This is nice until I purposefully take a picture upside down. I try turning the camera over to view it, but the camera flips it so it is still upside down. However, when I pull the pictures into my PC I can do anything I want with which way is up.The ZoomEX Browser software for pulling pictures from the camera is easy to use. With the Panasonic, I always used WIndows Explorer. With this I prefer Canon's software. One glitch: a process is left running that keeps me from releasing the SD card from my PC. I use Task Manager to murder the process tree, then I can \"Safely Remove Hardware\". I am probably not exiting the ZoomEX Browser correctly or something. I haven't check the web for solutions to this problem yet.Picture quality is excellent. Exposure is good. Disabling the flash in automatic mode is easy. Price was very good. Turn on/off speed is good. Movie mode is excellent. Sure beats the old VHS camcorder I had years ago. Twice the linear resolution makes for crisp, clear pictures on a standard TV. I am disapointed that zoom is disabled while recording. It doesn't use standard batteries, but a single charge goes a long ways.

I think giving this item 4 stars is not doing it justice but I can't give it 5 unless I thought it was perfect.I bought this after sampling numerous cameras in this size class. It's small enough to fit into a shirt pocket comfortably. I chose the gold color and it looks sweet. The controls and settings are not the most intuitive but not impossible either. The 2 1/2\" screen is ok considering how small the rest of the camera is. I guess I would be real picky asking for 3 inches. The preview image that you get on the LCD is grainy but don't be discouraged. It's not the final result when the picture is taken. I must note that this camera also has a viewfinder in case you don't want to use the LCD screen. One of my main criteria was ISO settings and shooting pictures in low light. Indoors, this camera does an amazing job. All you have to do is set it to AUTO and it will give your exposures plenty of light around the subject. It's also smart enough to know when you are outside. Although, if you are not satisfied with the AUTO flash outside, then you can adjust the ISO manually. There is some noise with that but who cares?As long as you shoot amazing pictures and this camera delivers. Another requirement when choosing a digi was the video quality. I've made a few videos and I'm impressed. This is actually better than some digital camcorders or at least on the same level. And to get that level in such a small package is remarkable. You can have fun with features like color accent or color swap. There is even time lapse video on here!Another neat photography feature is panorama. I have to say that instead of in-camera photo stitching, you have to wait until you load the images on your pc and use the included software. That's a bummer but it's something I can overlook considering what else this cam brings. That's one of my very few negatives along with the fact that you can't re-charge the battery without removing it from the camera. For the price, you get a lot of bang for your buck.

I am very happy with the size, weight, and images so far.I would say it is the same size and weight as a deck of cards, I might try a card case as my camera case! The materials of this camera are very nice, with only a few problems for me right now. The entire case is made of metal, except the battery cover and cable port cover. I think the battery cover should have been made of metal also for durability, and it is a bit weak in holding it shut; seems like it will be easy to open it accidentally, but the battery is held inside with a notch, so its just annoying for now. And on the front, it would have been nice if the silver rings that make up the lens assembly were a matte finish instead of glossy to match the rest of the camera. Flash works good, 2-3 sec btwn shots, and 1 sec startup time, so fast!Otherwise, I look forward to using this little toy for some great snapshots. Will update in the future.-Update 6/09Just got back from a week vacation where I used this camera exclusively for snapshots and some movie taking. It worked very well, with the battery never needing to be charged over the whole trip. I was probably snapping about 20 shots a day and a minute or so of hd movie. The size is excellent, just tossed it in my jeans jeans pocket and go, very convenient and portable. There were only a couple of small issues: at high ISO (night/dark shots) there was noticable noise in the shots, but not too bad. And I only have a 2GB card, so with the hd movies, I did start to worry about space, but ended up only filling it about 2/3. Something else I discovered while unloading pics to my computer is that once you take them off the camera, you can't transfer them back into the camera. I have winxp, so maybe its something with the program, but I didn't know that before.

I have had this camera since 2008, and it has worked great the entire time.  Originally I bought this camera to take pictures through a microscope for my zoology class and it worked great for that, but you have to really keep your hands steady to get a crisp picture.  That being said, the dedicated macro function on this camera is very nice, making it easier to get those photos.I also took this camera to Scotland & Europe and got some great snapshots with it.  The main draw to this camera was that it is 1)compact, 2)had macro capabilities, 3)has great lenses (as you would expect from makers like Canon or Nikon), and 4)had the truest to color blues and purples of the compact cameras that I tested in my price range.  I have even used this camera at a wedding with my pictures (mainly due to better color & composition) turning out better than some of the relatives that had more expensive cameras.  The bride definitely expressed her appreciation on that one!The main functions available are: auto, manual, macro, portrait, night, color accent, color swap, and a custom setting that includes options for kids & pets, indoor, sunset/rise, foliage, snow, beach, fireworks, aquarium, and underwater. These settings allow you a lot of creative settings to help you get the most out of your photos.  If you do a lot of people shots, turning on the face detection function can be a real asset, making it easier for your camera to focus on the people.  However, you need to remember to turn this function off if there aren't people in your pictures or you will get really frustrated.  You can also take multiple shots, continuous, delayed 10 & 2 second timers.Another nice feature to this point and shoot is the manual settings.

The quality is good, the options robust, and it's compact enough that it will fit you in your shirt pocket.This IS not the perfect camera if you're trying to take professional looking photographs, particularly of nature and especially outside. You just don't have the focal depth to get rich pictures. My father in law has one of the Canon SLRs and you can really see the difference in quality. But you can also see and feel the difference in the size of the camera you're carrying around (a few ounces that can fit comfortably in your pocket v. a few pounds that needs it's own case). I'm not saying it doesn't take good outdoor pictures, it just doesn't pick up everything that your eyes do.If you need a camera to take to parties, the kids' play date or soccer game, or just having fun, then this is a great camera.

It has held up extremely well and easily fits in my pocket for those times when I know I'll want pictures without the fuss of a bulky bag or other unnecessary accessories. I find the quality of the pictures to be clear and crisp, especially once you master the slight delay after pressing the button down. My favorite feature is the Color Accent where it grays out the rest of the colors except for the one you choose. I find it to be extremely user friendly, considering as soon as I got it, I started to play around with it, not once needing to look at the manual.I find the battery life to be pretty substantial, considering I can take pictures and video for hours without a problem (I also don't need to bother charging the battery all the time). When it comes to video, the sound and picture quality is pretty good for a camera that takes photos. A few downsides to the video, is that sometimes the quality is a bit pixilated, you'll really need good lighting and you cannot zoom once in video mode. You have to set the zoom before pressing the record button. Another down side to the photos is that although it has 12X zoom, most pictures are a bit fuzzy or blurry that close up. I've learned to try to keep an extremely steady hand when zooming that close.Overall, I love this camera, and whenever it breaks I'll most likely buy the exact same one all over again.

She wanted a small camera that was simple to operate and she could carry in her purse.  I won't belabor the details about the camera itself -- there are other reviews already posted that summarize all of its features.  My wife loves the camera because it is pink, small, compact, and simple for her to use.  I tend to be far more critical about my cameras and other electronic purchases.  Despite that, I find the Canon Powershot SD1100is takes very good photos with amazingly accurate color.  In fact, it was all I could do to keep from playing with it before I gave it to my wife for Christmas.  The camera is simple and fun to use.This camera focuses well even in low light conditions.  The automatic flash seems to assist with focusing in these situations.  The 3X optical zoom is adequate for most closeups.  Anyone needing a more powerful zoom should really be looking at SLR digital cameras.  The 8 megapixel resolution is more than adequate for viewing on a computer screen and should also make fine standard sized print photos.  I'm not sure most people would use this camera to make 8x10 prints, but I believe it would still perform adequately for this.  Battery life is very good.  I charged the battery a few weeks before Christmas, and my wife has already taken numerous photos without needing to recharge the battery.I purchased a 4 GB SDHC memory card for about $10 (also available from Amazon) and an additional rechargeable battery for about $8 (including S&H;).  Canon's (optional) pink custom camera case (which I purchased from Amazon for about $15) makes for a perfect digital camera outfit.  My wife loves the pink case -- it fits the camera perfectly, fits neatly in her purse, and seems rigid enough to protect the camera well.  There is really not room for additional items like the charger, USB cord, and spare memory, so if you need to carry additional things beside the camera you will be better off looking for a larger case.  The camera comes with a USB cord to download photos to your computer, but I find using a separate memory card reader (there are many available for purchase for very little money) makes this simple and easy with no drain on the camera battery.If you are looking for a stylish, basic digital camera that will take very good photos for not very much money the Canon Powershot SD1100is is well worth a look.  It is available in several different colors.  Frankly, I am strongly thinking about buying one for myself.", "Date": "January 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Best VIDEO quality of compact cameras", "Author": "idlewire", "ReviewID": "R1MUHIMPA2R9P1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a pocket camera that also took good video at 640x480. A friend of mine had the older SD1000 and I was particularly struck by the smoothness of the video. However, since that model was older, I tried the SD770 (since it was around the same price as the SD1100 and had more megapixels). What a disappointment! The video quality of the SD770 is far inferior to this camera, showing that \"more megapixels\" isn't always a good thing.Along the way, I have compared video quality of similar cameras by Casio, Fuji, Samsung, and other Canons. The SD1100 -- for whatever reason -- has the least noise and most watchable video.(A downside to the video is that the focus will not change during the length of the video, it is \"frozen\" at the moment you start recording. However this is true of all compact cameras.)As for picture quality, it is pretty good, but I found the SD770 to have a slight edge. However, for me, the vastly improved video quality was reason enough to choose this camera. I hate using flash, I don't like the way the resulting lighting looks, so I use this camera almost exclusively without flash. Set in \"Auto\" mode, the auto white balance leaves a lot to be desired, especially in indoor shots. Depending on the lighting, your shots may come out looking too yellow.However, I almost exclusively use this camera in Manual mode, and switching to Tungsten white balance usually helps for indoor pictures. As a plus, it also has a \"manual white balance\" mode, where you focus on something white and press a button, for lighting situations in which the presets are not perfect. This is a great feature too.Although you don't have direct control over shutter speed, there is an \"exposure\" setting.  I frequently use this to lower the exposure for indoor shots, so that the shutter speed will be greater, so that blurriness will be less of an issue. The picture will not be as bright, but in many cases will be clearer.Overall, I recommend this camera particularly if you are interested in shooting video. The picture quality is pretty good too but you may have to switch to Manual mode in some situations.", "Date": "January 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Good Price, Good Camera", "Author": "Wendy A.

The plastic doors are unimpressive, I hope they hold up. The buttons are simply arranged and well thought-out among monitor displays, menus, and functions. I wish the lens started out with a wider angle. The body size is nice and small, smaller than I expected from the product photo. Startup, shutter reponse, and recovery are still too slow. Movies are easy to shoot.Special-feature-wise you can easily set up color accent, color swap, sepia, dark or light skin tones and get obvious results. Other custom color settings changes are barely noticable. Stitching pictures that overlap in any way can be done in their verrrrry slooooow software.

The camera is very easy to operate, produces stunning pictures for such a small camera, and is just plain fun to use.  It has several modes to work with, but we mainly stick with just shooting images.  We currently use a 1 gig card to store the pictures, and so far that has been more than adequate.  For those that shoot a lot of photos before emptying the card may want to get a bigger one though.  For casual home use though, the 1 gig has been more than adequate.  The only nitpick I have regarding the memory card is that putting it back in takes a little extra effort for someone like myself who has big fingers.  It's a very minor thing and should not be a discriminating factor as the camera overall is superb.  Canon tends to produce some very nice small cameras, and this one is no exception.  So far my wife really likes it and has been using it quite a bit to shoot general images she probably would have passed on with her previous camera.  Like all gadgets, read the directions first as that will make it easier using it.

The zoom feature is allows for good, clear close up images.The only drawback I experienced, albeit minor was that the shutter speed of 1/1500 second is still not quick enough to freeze some action shots.That having been said, this is an excellent camera that will serve its users well.  Be sure to stock up on some spare batteries just in case you need to replace them.  Instead of using the 32MB memory card which comes with the camera, use a pair of 4GB SDHC memory cards instead.

I take a lot of landscape pictures so have set one of the available stored manual settings to compensate for outdoor bright light and blue/green color balance. Many of the the same functions, such as color balance for interior lighting, are also available on Auto. The combo of digital zoom to supplement the optical one gives very good resolution and the image statilization DOES WORK very well. The small camera size means it can easily be carried in a shirt pocket or small purse so you'll have it with you. You can control the image size (resolution) and the larger MB files can be enlarged to 16\"x20\" w/o loss of quality. You can adjust ISO (or leave Auto).

I chose it because Canon has one of the best digital camera reputations. I also chose it because it has a viewfinder, a rarity in today's digital camera world. Almost no digital point-and-shoot cameras have viewfinders, at least those under $200 (I bought this for $160). The screen stopped working completely on my previous camera, rendering it useless. A viewfinder would have allowed me to continue to use it without a hitch. It has very good stabilization and it feels well-made. The battery life in this camera is AMAZING! Granted, I don't use it that often, but I've taken over 200 pictures with it without the battery bar going down at all. I've only charged it 2 or 3 times in the 8 months I've had it. However, the battery bar is not a good indicator towards the end of the charge - once it goes down to one, you need to plug it in right away! The charger is also small and not cumbersome - you just place the battery in the charger and plug it into the wall - there isn't a cord! I have not had a single problem with this camera. Yes, I have had the battery/SD card slot door pop open, but neither the battery or the card have fallen out because the battery has a little lever that holds it in place and the SD card has to be pushed in in order to pop out. I put a screen protector over the screen and so far, it doesn't have any scratches. The outside of the camera looks brand-new. I love this camera and I would recommend it to anyone. I am not a photographer, nor do I have any experience with photos other for making digital photo books, but my pictures I've taken with this camera have satisfied me.

However, I had a good experience with the S5 IS and so, when it came time to buy my wife her first camera (for her birthday) - even with 20 years' experience with Olympus SLRs and Zuiko lenses - I chose the Canon PowerShot SD1100IS 8MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Gold), what I'm still calling an Elph. It's just easier.In showing her how to use it (the manual is twice the size of the one that came with my last computer), I fell in love with this little gem. It feels good. The LCD is big enough, but more important, the viewfinder is spot on. (It is not adjustable as is the S3 IS, but my wife doesn't need glasses.) 8MP is sufficient for casual photographers unless you're planning on printing billboard-size photos ... but then you wouldn't be a casual photographer.My wife wanted a camera to take picture of the grandkids and other family members (not that \"other family members\" become a secondary category once grandchildren arrive even though they do), but after taking a few picture of the dog, we went to San Francisco's Botanical Gardens. She took more than 200 pictures (ah, the difference between digital film) and, with no experience, came out with more than 40 fantastic shots including some macros that will certainly go into an album that she's now planning.I took another 100 photos around the local park and have posted them on my own \"amateur\" site where you can compare the four digital cameras I've now used for nature photography.The only feature that I would change IF it could be changed is to make the optical zoom 20x which, of course, is laughable in a tiny package such as this. The other features from macro to image stabilization are fantastic.There are many features which I'm sure my wife will never use, and there are some features the importance or value of which I've yet to figure out. Face detection is one, the print-share button (which gets you to buy a Canon printer, but also enables emailing photos), and to be honest, the LCD. Yes, when I got my Olympus in 2000, I loved the LCD. But within a month I found that, no matter how you set the display, about half the time you can't see the LCD clearly because of sunlight. But that's me. Most people I see using digital cameras use the LCD.All and all, this is just a great little camera with huge capabilities. If I wasn't afraid of missing a shot of a bird on my walks, I'd take my wife's camera instead of my S3.As I've said in all of my reviews of cameras, if you cannot focus, this camera will do that for you. If you cannot center a photo and come out with pictures of people without heads or other appendages, no camera will do that for you. Perhaps some people are born with composition and technique in their blood, and other just have a composition disability. If you fall into the latter category, read other reviews: maybe somebody has found the solution.Oh, and by the way, the gold SD1100IS takes much better pictures than the blue even though the blue is at times more expensive.

I bought this camera because of its very affordable price but also because it was ranked #1 on Amazon's top 100 cameras and point-and-shoots. I'm certainly not disappointed with my choice!I'm still trying to figure out how to properly turn off the flash and set the ISO for low lighting. I probably need to read the documentation a bit more, but I only found where to switch the ISO settings between \"Auto\" and \"HI Auto\". I took a few shots without the flash on ISO HI Auto and they were still fairly dark and very noisy.One recommendation I would make to anyone who buys this camera is to also buy a 4GB or 8GB SDHC memory card along with it.

Potvin", "ReviewID": "RIYRSWUYMPUDW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was purchased as a gift for my wife a while ago. I use Canon gear to shoot weddings, and will only recommend Canon gear to friends when looking for a point and shoot, or SLR camera. Nothing against Nikon, have used a Coolpix 950 way in the past, and never used their SLR line.This camera follows suite with any other Canon product we've owned. The image quality is stunning. Pictures are correctly exposed for the given conditions. The face tracker actually works quite well. The shutter delay is acceptable for a smaller point and shoot. Many point and shoots suffer from a prolonged period of time from when you press the shutter to when the picture is taken.There are a number of custom functions which allow for creative play in the menu system. You're not going to get full manual exposures on this model camera, but creativity modes are easily understood even for the novice. The menu system follows like all other Canon menus and are intuitive, displaying what keys to press for a given action. In other words, you don't need the manual in front of you to change operating modes. One of my favorite is color selecting. You can point the camera at a given color in the focal range. Select that color, when you take the picture, that will be the only color exposed, the rest of the image will be in black and white.The body of the camera tends to scratch rather easily. I'd suggest keeping it in a camera case Crumpler Thirsty Al is great Crumpler THIRSTY AL Camera Pouch!The videos taken by the camera are acceptable. Not that you'd expect anything phenomenal from gear like this, but they work in a pinch. They are imported right into iPhoto which makes editing on the Mac quite easy.One of the points that I made to my wife in getting her this camera over the Axxx series that Canon produces is the rechargeable battery. The battery seems to last forever, and recharges quickly. The battery is compact which adds to the compact size of the camera.Finally, Canon gear holds its value quite well. I am hear writing this review 6 months after she got the camera, and it has been superseded with a newer model, and the price is HIGHER than what I paid for it then. I've been quite successful in reselling well kept Canon gear for only about 30% less than what I paid for it.

Also - with the 16GB card - there is room for over 4000 pictures on the high quality mode - and 9999 on the lower setting. It's very easy to use for both still and video, and it starts fast (in case you need to take a pic in a hurry!), and the time in between photos is very fast at the low setting, and pretty fast at the high.If you're looking for great pictures in a camera smaller than your wallet - this is it...", "Date": "May 12, 2009"}, {"Title": "compact", "Author": "Rashel K.

With Canon's Face Recognition Tracking, taking focused pictures has never been so easy. I am really impressed how when reviewing the pictures in the camera it shows two images of the same shot. One of the entire image and the other one shows an up close look of the face. Even if the person moves while you are preparing to take the picture, Canon's Motion Detection Technology follows the person's face and keeps it in focus. The automatic red eye removal is a terrific highlight as well. Also another wonderful feature is the video mode. You are able to use the 3X zoom feature while recording videos, my other digital camera will not zoom while recording. I paid a few hundred dollars more for my \"other\" digital camera and this camera by far beats it quality, features, advance technology and reliability. Any other camera that would offer what the Canon Powershot SD100IS has you would expect to pay hundreds more.I purchased this as a camera/printer combo at a great price over the holidays. I can't give a review on the printer since I have not tried it out yet. I normally do not print out photos since I usually just upload the pictures to a CD or insert them in my digital photo frame. Wow how the times have changed. The bundle was offered for $20 more than the camera alone so how could I resist. I have no doubts that the printer works great since it is by Canon.Make sure to get an SDHC card to be able to store plenty of photos and mutliple video images.

Bought this as an entry-level replacement camera for my husband (who unfortunately dropped his last one), and who is not very technically minded.  And he absolutely loves it and is taking much better photos now. This is a great point-and-shoot camera for a beginner, or someone who doesn't want to mess with settings - or as a back-up if you have a much bigger better camera and just want something that will fit in your pocket, but still give you a great quality photo.This model includes face recognition, which seems to be the latest trend now - but it works just great.  Said husband always used to manage to take out of focus pictures whenever there were two people in the shot - because the camera would focus between them - face recognition successfully resolves that problem.Image stabilization helps to avoid the blurs.  Also offers great quality movies that you can zoom in and out of while shooting.However - it is quite tricky to access the great choice of pre-defined settings: the usual suspects such as indoor, outdoor, sports, etc. and some great extras like fireworks, aquarium, underwater, kids, color swap (there's more).  They are a couple of menus deep, and not very intuitive to find. We never use these settings, and still manage to get good shots 99/100. But - they're there for the beginner who wants to be a little more adventurous.  Also, the zoom button is a little difficult to manoever.  It comes with a printed manual (rare these days) that really does give excellent instruction on how to use all the different modes.In summary - if you want an entry level point-and-shoot that is pretty much guaranteed to give you beautiful quality pictures, this is your camera.", "Date": "February 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Love it", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R38ZC03UYAINBH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "takes great shots!

Ayerbe \"M. Ayerbe\"", "ReviewID": "R3HL6PEB3E5MP2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Hi! I've had this camera for a month now. Overall I'm happy, but there are some things I don't like.PROS- Lightweight, beautiful design.- Intuitive menus, easy to use.- It's right for someone who wants to just point and shoot, since most of it is handled automatically.- Great price.- Fits in your pocket, easy to carry.- Good video quality, even in low light conditions. Better than I expected, at least. It's virtually blur-free, so that's good.- I love the sound memo feature and the fact that you can record up to an hour of sound and the quality is good.- I love the feature that allows the camera to adjust the picture to the orientation of the camera, so that you can see it vertically or horizontally, just by tilting it.- The digital macro is very good, allowing me to take pics of very near subjects. Also, the quality is good enough to take pictures of documents, saving me valuable time not having to scan most of them.- Battery life with the provided Canon battery is good, lasting for about a week. It also charges fast, in about 1:30 hours for a full charge.- Being able to set white balance is very useful in indoor conditions.- You can check the settings with which you took each picture in display mode, which is really useful for the amateur photographer, though I guess all of these cameras do that.CONS- Produces red eyes almost every time. I had an old Olympus that did not produce red eyes at all. I don't understand why Canon can't handle this better.- \"Manual\" mode is very limited. You cannot select aperture or shutter speed, which is very disappointing. However, this feature is not available in any of Canon's compact cameras. So if you want to be able to use the manual features, you need to go for a bigger (in size) camera, meaning, one that won't fit in your pocket.- Image quality is ok, but not as good as I expected. I believe my old Olympus produced better shots. Granted, most of my shots have been in poor light conditions. Maybe I'll change my mind with some landscape pics with good light conditions.- Color is not as I expected (yes, my old Olympus seemed better), but then you have \"MyColors\" to try and tweak that a bit. My question is, why tweak it? Why not have great color once and for all? I feel it's a bit \"washed out\" or not saturated enough.- Night shots without a flash will most likely be blurred unless you use a tripod, no matter how much they announce their image stability feature.- This camera does not have a scene mode called \"Night scene\" which produced beautiful night pictures, with a slow synchro flash. This mode took some time to catch the background light and then at the end, it would shoot the flash, so that the people were lit in the foreground. In this camera there's no scene mode that does that (My old Olympus had it, of course and some Canon still have it). However, you can achieve similar results by using the \"Sloy synchro\" modality of flash. Now, you can only select that in the \"manual\" mode. Not in automatic, so it's kind of a pain.- The little flap door at the bottom that covers the memory card and the battery is really flimsy. You have to be careful not to break it.- Some pics do have some noise, even at ISO200, which is strange, I'd read that you would see some noise in ISO400 and up, but that's not true.I suggest downloading the PowerShot Product Line Spring/Summer 2008 catalog, available in this link: [..]It shows all the digital cameras and their features in more detail.

It's VERY easy to use and VERY compact.In some of the reviews people complained about the \"lense fault error\" and I got a little spooked about it. But now that I've had the camera, I've also had the same error 2 or 3 times because I was holding the camera with the lense against the palm of my hand when I turned it on. The camera immediately halted to prevent lense damage. All I did was turn it off and back on and it was just fine.There's plenty of manual options to set if you get into those special effects, but I just prefer to set it on auto and point and shoot. All my Hawaii photos turned out beautiful and I'm not disappointed one bit on purchasing this camera. One warning, however: The photo card that comes with this camera only holds about 8 pictures!

This is my fourth digital camera in the span of about four years, and my first subcompact camera.  I have used Sony, Kodak, and Polaroid cameras and the Canon is by far the best as far as image quality and durability.  I love that it fits right in my pocket and I don't have to haul around a camera bag.  It doesn't weight down my purse if I want to carry it in there.  It's pink.  It's made of sturdy metal instead of plastic, like my other three cameras were.  The buttons feel sturdy and it has a super-easy user interface.  It takes great photos, and I was even brave enough to take it out of auto mode with the help of the instruction manual.  One thing I love about Canon is that instead of cramming all the different manuals (language wise) into one booklet, there is a booklet especially for English!  This means I can discard the other book and only have one small manual to put in my camera bag.I suggest going to a store and handling it a little bit before ordering to make sure it isn't too small for your hands.  I have larger hands and it seems to work OK for me, but I can see how some people might not like the size if they are used to a larger camera.  It is always a good idea to look at electronics in person before buying, but the prices in the stores were much higher than Amazon.  I was not able to see the camera in pink in the store, so I was a little concerned that it would be too pink or not pink enough.  It ended up being a great color, not so pink as to be annoying or to stand out.  It doesn't look like a toy.  Macro mode is excellent, and battery life is great.  I love that it has image stabilization built right in because it means that I have fewer blurry images to delete.

The switch for switching between viewing, camera and video mode is made of plastic and is recessed. I find this makes it a little difficult to switch modes quickly and more inconvenient. The battery cover is also made of plastic now and seems like it would snap off very easily if you were too rough with it.I have yet to test it fully but i don't think it'll be much of a disappointment.

His did not have one and on sunny days it was very difficult to tell what you were taking a photo of. Although you don't often need the viewfinder, it is definitely a plus in our mind. We also like that it has the rechargable battery. We bought an extra battery so we will not be caught without a charged battery.

This has been a purchase that I have not regretted.  The camera has great manual controls which allow you to keep customize settings such as white balance, flash, timers, etc.  Another feature I like is the way the screen changes depending on the way you have oriented the camera.  My friends love when I carry this camera because it takes such good pictures.

Low light conditions are a bit grainy at times, but I've yet to find a good way of working around that.I just noticed that Canon came out with other IS (Image Stabilization)models with more MPs. They sound really nice too, but I can't say anything about their performace since I've never used them. Do your research...

The in camera red eye fix works great and leanring how to navigate all the functions did not take long at all.

There is an \"Optical Image Stabilizer\" which reduces the blur of any camera movement, even with low light.  There is also a cool feature called, \"Face Detection WB\" which means the camera concentrates upon faces, then it calculates \"white balance\" for the best colors and tones.  You can also just select ONE face among the group to highlight (think Birthday parties)!There is a cool \"red-eye\" correction that identifies and corrects red-eye when pictures are taken.  You can also later detect and correct \"red-eye\" during image playback.The camera is smaller and thinner than my previous Nikon and it fits very easily into any pocket (be careful!).  It's quick, easy and responds readily.  It is a great value for the price.  The pictures are just as good (maybe better) than my old camera.

Unfortunately she did not come and talk to me first who over time has owned four different digital cameras over 12+ years and shemade a purchase from a guy behind the counter in a department store. She has been very frustrated with what she got finding it complicated and non-intuitive.After a couple of months, and bearing the brunt of her frustration with the digital age I decided to take things into my own hands. I began to do the research and settled on the SD1100IS after a fair amount of research and reviews. I offered her the substitution and the opportunity to use the 1100IS. It is a hit.She finds the organization of the buttons and functions much clearer and simpler. It is not over loaded with features or complicated options. She prefers the rechargeable batteries because the other camera ran through AAs like  a bear at a picnic. She finds the viewing screen much less susceptible to black out from glare and if necessary she loves still having the option of the peephole viewer to shoot through.  All in all she is now very happy although she is unwilling to wade into the world of uploading pictures to the computer and will still keep Kodak happy going to the picture printer at Walmart.  I guess it is one step at a time.I am impressed with the quality of the pictures, the color balance, the excellent macro function, and the speed with which she was able to adapt to this camera.All I need to do now is to figure out how to get rid of the first camera she bought.", "Date": "September 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "SAM", "Author": "SAM \"SAM\"", "ReviewID": "R29E11CGSM7JTA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera takes much better than  expected photos, is easy to carry around and I was able to purchase it at a great price throught Amazon.

This camera is small, so much so that it can perfectly fit in your pocket.  It's about the same size as a cell phone.  The face detection on this camera is amazing, it will track faces (even if they are moving) and focus right on them.  There are a few settings that can be played with in the manual mode, but not many.  This is to be expected though being it is a point and shoot.  I love the navigational pad, it is flush to the rest of the camera, but it is big enough so you don't mistake the keys (even if you are not looking).  The battery life on the camera is great, usually get around 240 pictures, but that can be extended by tweaking the power save settings in the menu.  There is only one function I wish they would have added to the camera, and that is stitch shooting.  The style of the camera is great, the chrome ring around the lens looks awesome, but will get finger prints all over it realllly quick.Over all this camera is amazing, just wish there was a stitch feature.[UPDATE] I found the stitch setting, it is at the bottom of the menu (when you press the menu key).After having the camera for a month I still love it, I take it everywhere with me.  The face detection is amazing, although I found it has a hard time detecting faces in low lighting, which is to be expected.  The image stabalization is outstanding in HI ISO where you can't use a flash.  I haven't noticed too much grainy-ness when shooting in HI ISO, maybe when you maximize the picture.... but who does that???I bought a backup battery just in case, I wasted 30 bucks... don't bother, the battery on this thing is amazing!!

My SLR (Canon Digital Rebel XT) and my video camera (Sony HDR-SR5) were too bulky to lug around for such occasions. I was considering Flip Video Camcorder, but that seemed to lack good photo qualities.Since most of my family lives far away, I also wanted the ability to easily share my home videos on sites such as youtube.Movie mode records in AVI which results in HUGE files. They should have used MPEG (H.264)that uses compression while almost retaining the movie quality. A 35 second movie takes up approximately 68 MB of space whereas after conversion to another format such as WMV (using windows movie maker), it takes only 4 MB with an almost unnoticeable quality loss to my untrained eye.The implications of choosing AVI over MPG (or other compressed file type) are:1. Your memory card will fill up in no time (an empty 2GB card will allow 16 minutes of video)2. You will have to convert it (compress) your video before you can upload a 5 minute video to youtube.I understand that this is a camera and not a camcorder, but a simple change of format would make this device almost flawless!", "Date": "October 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Probably better to stay away from this product...I'll be avoiding Canon products alltogether", "Author": "Andrei Schaffer \"I doubt, therefore I think\"", "ReviewID": "R14EEIHMTADHBS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Everything has been nice for an year or so, except I've recently got an infinite loop type of error: \"Lens error, restart camera.\" Upon restarting I get the same thing, ad infinitum.

I settled on the SD1100IS Elph after having done some research, reading scores of reviews and spending time comparing similar point and shoots like Sony's Cybershot, Panasonic Lumix, Nikon Coolpix and others. I kept coming back to this one because of the style, the compact build, the numerous favorable reviews, all of the functionality and the fact that it had a viewfinder which I thought would come in handy shooting in bright sunlight.I think it would help to know my skill level as a photographer (none) and technical ability (pretty good with everything BUT digital cameras). So if you're the technical type and looking for how this measures up compared to other digital cameras from a strictly technical standpoint, you will likely want to skip this review!As a rank beginner I had to start out slow, poring over the manual and learning the basics, then began experimenting by taking close-up pictures of my cat. At first I ended up with a lot of washed out shots of a squinting, irritable-looking animal. Luckily within 24 hours my knowledge and skill level improved markedly (see my image posts on December 14, 2008 - three pics taken in late afternoon in foliage mode make me look like I didn't just get started yesterday..and I did).Having said that though, I still think you shouldn't let the \"point and shoot\" designation fool you. If you have never used a digital point and shoot, there is a lot more to learn than pointing and shooting. In fact it's a pretty complex business to take great pictures, but this camera does help make the process as easy as possible. I found the biggest improvement I could make was learning to select scene modes for various scenarios (indoors, outside, etc.). There are so many cool features packed into this little wonder that it would probably take months to learn everything, but you can start taking pictures like a pro in a surprisingly short amount of time if you just experiment and then refer back to the manual when you need to know how to take a specific shot or figure out where you went wrong when they come out wrong. After having shot a few images that were overexposed (standing too close, should have turned off the flash); blurry (didn't follow the advice of pressing shutter button halfway down to let the camera focus first); or \"noisy\" - where I will experiment with adjusting the ISO settings downward) - I put the blame on myself and not the camera and I think rightfully so.Other pluses are its size - it is really compact but not so much that it's hard to hold. You do want to put the wrist strap on and make a point of wearing it whenever you take pictures because it's easy enough to drop. I liked that it came with a charger you can just plug directly into the wall without an adapter, and that the battery charged in less than an hour and a half.Perhaps the easiest thing of all is installing the camera software on your PC and downloading images. The image transfer was nearly instantaneous -no waiting. And I really appreciated that every time I took a bunch of new pictures and reconnected the camera, I got a window asking me if I just wanted to download the pictures that hadn't been transferred to the PC yet. No hunting around for images and trying to figure out how to just separate out the latest ones to download.Another cool thing an advanced photogrpher will appreciate - and so will I as I learn more - is that in the ZoomBrowser application (on the accomapanying CD) you can review your photos and get detailed shooting information on every shot you take - shutter speed, aperture, light metering, ISO speed, focal length, shooting mode, image size and quite a few other things as well.If you're still on the fence about this, shop around and hold out for a great deal. I got mine at Best Buy and they threw in a 2GB memory card as part of the package. The 32MB one it comes with is a bit of a waste of time, as it will probably only hold less than 10 high quality images.I will admit I hesitated a long time before settling on the Elph after having been scared a bit by the negative feedback on the fatal lens error issue. Doing some poking around into this, I think it's something that probably happened in a small percentage of Canon point and shoots, and an even smaller percentage of this particular model. If you're worried, buy it locally and get an extended service protection plan. I did, and I figured it was worth the extra piece of mind for the under $18 a year for two years that I paid for it.Not to get too far off topic but I experienced issues with faulty equipment in my Canon Pixma printer when it was brand new, and their customer service (via email) was lightening fast (we are talking a couple hours at most in each case) and they replaced the ink cartridges I needed fast and at no cost to me. I am of the impression that Canon is a great company and have only experienced excellent customer service each of the several times I have contacted them for help and/or advice.If I had to pick one negative about this camera, I'd say that the little door that covers the entry point of the connector cable where you hook it up to your PC or TV (for transferring/viewing images) is a really flimsy piece of plastic that seems like it will almost certainly bend off with regular use.

So far it has held up well.When there is good ambient light, the pictures come out crisp and clear.  However, it tends to get grainy and washed-out in lower light.

In my work, the flash attracts too much attention, and so I constantly have to manually switch it off every time I turn the camera on, which could be up to 80+ times a day.  Very annoying.

It's 4:08pm, I'm in my hotel room 40 miles away from home relaxing. My girlfriend is a bridesmaid doing her thing with the bride. I just finished kicking off my shoes, putting things away in the room, and wolfing down a huge chicken sandwich. The wedding is scheduled for 6pm and will be taking place on a yacht in Newport Beach, CA. As in a boat that will be floating away from the dock at 6pm sharp. Meaning you had better be on time for this one!!Well imagine my disgust, when I decided to hop on mobile web 2.0, and login to my amazon account to check shipping status. USPS tracking sucks by the way, and best as I could tell, it would be here on Monday, not today (Saturday). NOPE! The magic words appeared right there on my cell phones tiny 3x2 inch screen..... DELIVERED. YAAAAAOOOUUCCCHHH!Boats departing in 1hr 52 minutes, I'm 40 miles away from home. What would you do? You guessed it, turbo mode ENABLED. I was dressed and on the road in less than 2 minutes! Needless to say I made excellent time, while simultaneously obeying all traffic laws.When I finally arrived at home, I was ecstatic to see the package sitting on my doorstep! It probably didn't sit too long, but believe me when I say this, in my neighborhood it would not have lasted long, certainly not overnight till the next afternoon!Well, NO TIME to familiarize, aka play with toy. I tore open the amazon package with the force and gusto of 100 rats. Strait to the charger & battery, I know what needs to be done. The charger & battery are on the wall, and I'm changing into my suit which I brought with me from the hotel. Sweat beads were building, and before long I had a full on sweat-a-thon on my hands. Unbelievable!A 15 minute charge is all I was able to muster. It was time to leave now, or I'd be left standing at the dock! I Grabbed the camera (8gb card inside) and the charger + battery pack off the wall. No time to be neat, all this stuff goes in my pockets, LETS GO ALREADY!!! Luckily I was able to plug the address into my nav phone, which was a total life saver on this day. However, I was 30 minutes away from the boat and not in a good position to make it on time. At this point I was really starting to worry.5:58pm and I'm stuck in horrifying traffic on Pacific Coast Hwy, just having got off the freeway, I was less than a quarter of a mile away!! It was at this point that I began to pray, you know the one. The \"Dear Lord I'll do anything if....\" prayer. Yeah that one. Well the Lord answered my prayer on this day. Even though I pulled into the wrong driveway. The driveway I was supposed to turn into was the previous one!!! I pulled into parking, and was VERY surprised to see my girlfriend pulling in right behind me! HUH! I beat YOU! WOW. So I helped her bring on board some parting gifts, and even though I was one of the last ones there, I was one of the first on the boat. Made it, unreal!There's still another dilemma here however, and this is I'm stuck with a camera I don't know anything about! Oh well, AUTO mode, and pray that \"Point and Shoot\" MEANS Point and Shoot! Luckily the layout of the camera is very user friendly, and it only took a few seconds to realize the basic functions of the camera. I also decided not to turn on the camera until it was time to shoot, because of the short charge time. One thing that did kinda irk me was the fact that red eye reduction is not set by default factory settings. So The night ended up with quite a few red eyed pics. The red eye could easily be removed in photoshop CS3 though.After going through the images the next day, I was extremely happy with the quality of the images. I left the camera in full auto mode that night, and will let the pictures speak for themselves. I was also very suprised that I took nearly 150 pictures on such a short 15-minute charge.I hope you enjoyed reading about my little dramatic experience, and hope you enjoy the pictures produced by this wonderful LITTLE camera.[...]The free print offer from shutterfly should come in handy!", "Date": "August 17, 2008"}, {"Title": "Lens Error", "Author": "Bill Baehr \"whipperin1\"", "ReviewID": "R13BT1XMBWLW3Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Buyer Beware: I too have a Canon that was used very little and the lens locked up and the lens error message appeared.

A few things to be aware of before buying this camera:-- Read the reviews that list out the specs on this cameras, features, etc.  They are nice to review and give you an idea what is going on.-- BUT, I have not found one that mentions the special NB-4L battery this camera uses instead of regular ones.  This is not a huge deal, but like any special battery comes issues with What If the Battery Dies?  You will be jammed up, since it is unique, and does not charge quickly like the Rayvoc 15 minutes ones.-- BUY at least a few more battery back ups!-- Remember, this is a point and shoot, not a professional grade camera, so do not expect the world from it.  For the price and size, it does solid work, and will prove a great camera for years to come.-- Consumer Reports named this camera their Top Pick for Compacts!  But they failed to mention the battery as well.  This was one of the rare rankings from CR that they did not recommend every item in a category, so this could mean a great product.Good luck, and like any product, if it has an error, get with the companies as fast as possible for a replacement or refund.

The basic mode (point and shoot) is adequate, but the zoom, no flash and so on settings are not hard to figure out and I used them extensively. I found that it did not take good pictures out of a moving train (blurry), so if you want to use it for something as \"sophisticated\" as this buy something else (may be I need to look deeper into the instructions).", "Date": "September 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Canon PowerShot SD1100IS Rocks!!", "Author": "Storm505", "ReviewID": "R266KASZLOCNU1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just love this camera!!

Yes, the quality of the photo is excellent and it has many features, however, I did not read one single review which commented on the problem that the date and time is not imprinted on the photo when reviewing the photo but can be imprinted when printing out the photo if selected.What good is a photo when the date and time is not on the photo.  Nikon and Casio camera imprint the date and time on the photos taken.  The user has the option of turning off the imprint should it be necessary.I work as a residential property manager and frequently photograph rental units after the tenants have moved out in order to prepare the refunds of deposits.  I have a nice Nikon 5.1 MP but the shutter time is extremely slow.  I end up having to wait 5 seconds before being able to shoot the next photo.  You can imagine how frustrating it is to spend time waiting in between shots.The problem of not having the date and time imprint when I download the photos on my notebook makes my work very difficult.  I only print out photos when necessary, therefore, if I move the original photo from the memory card to my notebook computer, I can not print the photo with the date imprinted.  The date can be imprinted by connecting the camera to the printer and selecting this feature.Do not purchase this camera if you need the date and time imprinted on the photo without having to print.  Get a Casio Exilim because the quality is just as good and the menu is user friendly unlike Canon's.Canon needs to go back the drawing board and add this important feature.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Worst ever", "Author": "Onu Rokumus", "ReviewID": "R14RNSGDVY27U2", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I've never seen a digital camera useless like this.
