{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Does lots of stuff, hard to set up", "Author": "M. Strahan \"Weatherman\"", "ReviewID": "R16MUKPRHOEMEE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my sister, who just had a new baby.  I wanted a wireless web came with two way audio, so that she could take it from room to room.  I couldn't find a simple wireless webcam, so I bought this thing, which does way more than I wanted.  Luckily, I like gadgets, and this is one neat gadget.  However, its very difficult to setup if you want to use some of its advanced capabilities.  Since the manual does not give very good instructions, I'll try to describe the basic things you need to do to set it up, as well as provide an overview of what it does.  Do not buy this camera if you are not comfortable configuring your router.  Someone who doesn't have basic networking skills would probably give this camera one star.Pros1)  Can be an excellent security camera.  The motion detection software works well, and the IR night vision is very good.  The two way audio over the internet means you can speak to people it sees.  It can be setup to send an email to your cell phone, and then you can log onto it with a PC and view and speak to your intruders or guests.  It can also record video clips to network storage, although I couldn't get it to mount a shared windows directory.  It seems to want a linux based shared drive.2) The video quality is good, although not what you would call high quality.  It's a little bit jerky, but that's what you get with this technology.3)  Has a nice mounting bracket that you can screw to a wall.  The bracket has a tilt swivel mount on it like a camera tripod mount, so you can easily attach/detach the camera from the mount.  This means you can carry it from room to room when using as a webcam, then put it back on the wall mount to use it as a security camera.4) The included software can view multiple cameras at the same time, with each camera being displayed in a tile, just like a professional security camera system.Cons1) Horrible setup.  If you don't know how to configure your wireless router, you won't be able to view this camera over the Internet.  See below.  However, if you only want to view it from a PC on your local network, and don't need the email notices when it detects motion, you can set this thing up just fine.  This means you can't use it as a webcam, though.  The instructions do not tell you anything about configuring your router to do this.2)  No autofocus.  How do you focus a wireless camera that is in a different room than the computer monitor you use for viewing the camera?  You can't, because you can't turn the manual focus ring and see the results as you turn it.  This makes for a lot of back and forth to get the thing focused.  The solution is to bring your wireless laptop with you as you move the camera.3) Won't mount a windows shared directory.  Technical support has yet to answer my email about this.  Basically, this means you can't have it automatically record video clips to your PC when it detects motion.  You can still record video clips manually, through the software interface, though, even onto a PC over the Internet.4) No tilt/pan.  Some cameras in this price range come with tilt/pan.  I sacrificed it to get the two way audio and the IR night vision. The field of view is pretty wide, so I don't really miss the tilt/pan.Setup tipsMost people's wireless router will have a dynamic IP address assigned to it by your Internet provider.  Computers and cameras on your wireless network will have private IP addresses that are not routable to the Internet.  By default, this camera wants to use 192.168.10.30 as its IP address.  Your router may not recognize this private address.  Mine was setup to only use a 192.168.1.x network.  I had to reconfigure the router's private network to the 192.168.10.x network to talk to the camera.Furthermore, there is no way to view the camera on that private network from a PC over the Internet.  However, you can configure your router to route incoming requests from the Internet to the camera.  You have to set up ports 80 and 554 to be redirected to the camera's private IP.  Next, you have to be able to find your routers external dynamic IP address from a web browser on an Internet PC.  The only way to do that is to sign up for a dynamic DNS service.  When your router gets its IP assignment, it will report it to the dynamic DNS service, who will map it to a URL that you will type in your browser.  Once set up, you view your camera over the Internet by typing in your URL.  The dynamic DNS service sends your browser to your router's IP address, then your router redirects the request to the internal private IP address of the camera.  A similar redirect would be needed if you were running a hardware firewall on your network.  Note, the camera does have the ability to report its IP address to a dynamic DNS service, too.  Only use this if the camera's IP address is actually routable over the Internet.  Most of us will have the camera on a private network, with an IP address that is not routable.  In this cae, if you use the dynamic DNS from the camera, instead of your router, it will not work.If you want to setup email from the camera, you need to be able to configure it to talk to your provider's SMTP server.  It's very similar to setting up an email client, so if you can do that, you can do this.  It can send email and record pics/vid without you having to setup that dynamic DNS, thankfully.  You only need the dynamic DNS if you want to view it over the internet.", "Date": "January 9, 2008"}, {"Title": "insecure camera; huge design oversights", "Author": "Garret Wilson", "ReviewID": "R1SSX9Q2066HK1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "You'd think that a security camera would get Internet security right. This one doesn't even try.The camera doesn't support SSL/TLS connections. This means that, every time you log in to the camera across the Internet, your password is going across in the clear, and anyone sufficiently interested can then use that password to log into your camera in your home and watch what you're doing or record their own copy. Furthermore, even without logging in, your communication with the camera is open for the world to see. This a huge oversight that has no excuse; it's like installing new locks in a house and leaving the key under the doormat.If you try to set up email alerts to notify you of certain actions (e.g. motion detection), you'll find that the camera does not support secure SMTP servers. In other words, every time the camera sends email, it will be sending your email password in the clear, so that interested parties could later log into your email account and do whatever they want.The product uses a proprietary Internet Explorer ActiveX control, which forces you to use IE instead of a more secure and standards-compliant browser like Firefox. But that's not bad enough. The ActiveX control apparently has no understanding and support of Vista NTFS permissions. This means that in Vista if you try to record to certain directories on the hard drive, it fails with a cryptic error message---even if the user has administrator rights. The only apparent way to get around this is to run Internet Explorer as Administrator (a special Vista super-user that has more rights than even a user with normal administrator rights), which is a bad idea in general and reflects the outdatedness of the implementation.There is no way to tell the camera to start recording to the local hard drive when some action occurs. Sure, you can have the camera record to a \"network hard drive\", if you can figure out how to set one of those up. Or you can have the camera record to a USB drive hooked up to the camera, which someone can easily steal along with the camera. Or you can manually record to the local hard drive. But you can't simply leave your browser window open and have the camera only start recording to the local hard drive when there is some activity.This would be a great little camera if someone with actual security experience had been in charge of its firmware. There is no excuse for these huge lapses in design, ruining what could easily have been a great product.Update 2011-07-04: I was excited that firmware upgrade 1.1.0 build 72 purports to add SSL support! A closer look reveals that TRENDnet is utterly incompetent when it comes to networking. Yes, the firmware allows you use SSL for the SMTP server (outgoing emails), and this works. But that's the only good news. While there is now a configuration for specifying an incoming SSL port (default 443), if you try to connect with Internet Explorer 9 you get \"Video is not support for HTTPS Protocol.\" Lovely. And if you connect from outside the network using Firefox (using port forwarding on the router), the Java applet won't load, giving \"java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: ultracam.class\". And of course the TRENDnet SecurView Mobile Android app doesn't support SSL in the least. Utter incompetence.Update 2012-04-20: Now TRENDnet is saying that firmware version V1.1.1 build 74 brings \"improved security\". But Firefox still gives a ClassNotFoundException, and IE still says \"Video is not supported for HTTPS Protocol\". And of course the Android app still doesn't support SSL. But security is so important to me, you know what I'm doing? I'm leaving the SSL turned on, even though I can no longer view the video in IE or in Firefox, and I'm using IP Cam Viewer, a third party Android app, to view the live camera stream over SSL on my phone! It's unbelievable that I have to use software not even written by TRENDnet to view the secure feed. Then again, by now it should be expected.", "Date": "January 1, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Night mode.  Poor Day Mode.  Not so hard to setup.  Frustrating Limitations.", "Author": "Jace E. Mouse", "ReviewID": "R86RY0NMG7TWD", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "You can't find a better device at this price point, but it does come with some annoyances and limitations.Things I Like:- Really great night mode via built-in infrared lights.- Stable.  No crashes or hiccups in the month I've had it.- Solid construction.  The camera and included mounting bracket are very sturdy.- MPEG streaming video.  Really nice quality, and a fraction of the bandwidth required by MJPEG standards, so there's less \"internet lag.\"- The ability to backup your settings is a nice touch, in case you have to reset the camera for any reason.- Three year warranty.- Support for sound.  Built-in ability to listen (from IE, not from Firefox/Java) and the ablilty to connect speakers to \"talk through\" the camera.This I Dislike:- Camera gets \"stuck\" in night mode.  Under normal indoor lights, the camera often continues to force itself into night mode, which results in strange washed-out colors.  This is made more frustrating by software limitations that don't allow you to manually control which mode the camera operates in.  Seems to work okay in fluorescent lights from office settings.  Surely, this is all just a software glitch that will be fixed in an eventual software patch....I hope.- Always requires a username and password to view the camera.  So if you want to just setup a public camera, that's a frustrating limitation.- Difficult to remove Trendnet's \"branding\" around their live video images - their logo, border, and other stuff.  I think this can be done, but it's certainly going to require web developer skills and a bit of hacking to do it.Other things you'll want to know:- Focusing the camera is done via the focus ring on the front of the housing, not from within the software.  So you have to be physically present at the camera to do it.  That means you'll also need your laptop (or a friend on a phone) to know you're getting it right.- TrendNet's site includes a \"lobby cam\" from their office, as well as a simulated user interface, and digital version of the manuals.  That gives you a pretty good feel for what you're going to get with the camera.- Viewing this camera from outside your home network is going to require some advanced skills in updating your router's settings.  It's not especially hard, and there are instructions online to do it.  But unless your router supports these settings and you're willing to tinker with them, many of the camera's features are going to be unavailable to you.- The setup was not nearly as difficult as I thought it would be, based on other reviews.  The need to connect it via a network cable to do the initial setup is a little annoying, but understandable and not too difficult if you've read through the manual.  The manual is actually pretty well-written - you can download it from the manufacturer's site to judge for yourself.", "Date": "June 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor documentation, undocumented URLs", "Author": "E.

The image is browser accessible via the local network with most browsers (Safari, Firefox, IE).The price on this camera was significantly lower than many other wireless cameras capable of joining a more secure WPA2 wireless network and also providing night vision.

The software SecurView also does not work on a Mac.DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR AFTER YOUR PURCHASEObjective - set it up to access it from any computer away from home.What I have at home: a router (with a firewall) and a cable internet connection.If the firmware of your camera is 1.0.0.0 version 30+, the camera's IP is fixed 192.168.10.30. Thus to talk to the camera you will need to change the IP of your computer on the TCP/IP of the internet connection that it's being used, to a fixed IP starting in 192.168.10.xx (in the xx use any number you want).If the firmware of your camera is newer, it comes with a DHCP (it will take a router assigned ip - thus you don't need to change the IP of your computer.After finding out what is the ip of your camera, you have to access it to set it up, via your browser, just type in the ip of the camera and it will show up a setting up screen. Here is very straight forward:-> go to the ip setup and put the same domain of your router (i.e. 192.168.2.***). You can use a fixed IP or DHCP.Note, if you had to change your computer's ip to talk to the camera, after setting it up, you will have to change your computer back, to talk to the camera in the new domain.From within your router, all you need to do now is to type your camera's IP in the browser in order to access it.From outside (through the internet), you still need a bit more setting up to do:In the camera, change the access port from 80 to 81 (port 80 is blocked by many ISPs).Now, go to the set up in your router and you have to open the port 81 for outside traffic. Just grant access (inbound port 81, put the IP of your camera, outbound port 81).Now you have to know what is your external IP (the one provided to you by your ISP). You can use [...] (note that some ISPs change your IP regularly), so you allways need an updated ip address.In order to have that done automatically, sign up to a free account at [...]. Then go to your router and in the DDNS section of the setup, put in your dyndns sign in and password. The router will keep updating the dyndns with your external IP, so that everytime you go into your created dyndns address, it will forward you to the right external IP of your ISP/Router.Now, to access your camera from outside, just type into any browser (IE works better), [...]  ([...]), so that it will access the port that you have previously opened.Well, that's it !!! Easy huh? ;-)  It took me a long time to find out how to do it, but it works beautifully after this. The product is 5 stars, but the setting up is tough (but it couldn't be different, this is a sophisticated demand).Have fun.", "Date": "April 27, 2009"}, {"Title": "Multiple cameras do not work together!", "Author": "Marcos Lacerda \"marcos\"", "ReviewID": "R2BO8F49CH022R", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought 4 units of this camera and so far only 3 were delivered.

They were all working fine (after much configuration and updating) in our old house.  We built and moved into a new house in 2012.  Anyway, I disconnected them all and left them in a box for a little over a year.  When I went to install them in the new house over the past week only one would work.  The rest all just keep blinking the yellow LED.  It would appear that they have lost the firmware - there must be a battery or capacitor that maintains the memory and it must have expired.  So, don't leave them unplugged for a long time.  I will try to contact Trendnet to see if they can be restored (at the moment their website is down).Update 1: So, Trendnet did respond with a copy of the instructions from the manuals (yes, manualS, their response was a conglomeration of the paper manuals in the original package plus later versions available on-line) for setting up and also resetting the cameras.  One important difference, that I did not note immediately, was that the time to hold the reset button in their e-mail was 15 seconds instead of the 3 seconds in the manual.  Wow!  That made the difference.  Now the supposedly failed units came back to life.  However, unlike what the manuals say, and unlike what their e-mail says, it did not reset to the factory settings, it reset to my old settings (including password, camera name, IP address and e-mailing and motion detection settings.  I'm back in business and have begun updating to the latest firmware.Update 2: In my old house, I found that in order to maintain connectivity I had to power off/power on the cameras periodically.  I had installed light timers to do this on a twice a day basis.  Now, with the latest firmware whenever there is a power off/power on sequence, the cameras lose their e-mail functionality.  All you have to do is go to the Event Server : Email setup page and select Apply.  Then the e-mail starts working again.  So, now in order to maintain functionality while away from home, I need to install each camera with a UPS.  This will be a much more expensive solution than the light timer!Update 3:  I discovered a new phenomenon - one of my power supplies was not providing sufficient power - less than the 5-volts required, but enough to light a LED.  Any camera connected to this power supply follows the same pattern as if it needs resetting - that is, it continuously blinks the yellow LED and will not reset.  So, this was complicating my re-installation of my cameras.

The DiskStation does a nice job of motion-detection and records audio with the video.", "Date": "May 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "OK but may be overpriced unless you need Night vision", "Author": "Tom Servo", "ReviewID": "R29AM728ROKVLZ", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The Trendnet TV-312WN is a 802.11n (150Mbps) WiFi enabled cam with a 10/100Mbit Ethernet port. This camera is a Day/Night cam, meaning that it can work in dark/no light environments due to the 6 Infrared LEDs around the lens. Note however that the effective range of these LEDs is not very far.THE GOOD:+ Camera has MPEG4 & MJPEG compression. Some cheaper cams (including those in the Trendnet series) only feature MJPEG compression. With MPEG4 you generally can support more cams/achieve a faster frame rate than using MJPEG, especially if using WiFi.+ There is a USB1.1 port on the side where you can connect a FAT16/32 formatted drive and have the camera record directly to it (if desired, this feature is optional). This is actually a feature removed in newer Trendnet cameras like the TV-IP602WN.+ As mentioned above this is a Day/Night camera and has IR LEDS for illumination in darkness. Note however it is NOT waterproof so make sure the cam doesn't get wet.+ By default the camera gets an IP address via DHCP. If there is no DHCP server it will use 192.168.10.30 (Of course you can set a static IP address in setup)+ Works fine with BlueIris software (not included with camera)THE BAD:- This camera does not feature a slow shutter feature to improve the quality of low light images, as done in other cameras such as the Trendnet TV-IP602WN.- This camera does NOT have an IR filter so use outdoors will not give accurate colors, even if outdoor mode is selected in setup. This is a disappointment and a major disadvantage. As is this cam is best for use indoors and might make a good baby monitor. But I cannot recommend it for outdoor use, even though it's day/night.- There doesn't seem to be an adjustment in setup for white balance. Maybe it's automatically set?- This camera supports 150Mbps 802.11n WiFi only (one antenna only). Other cams, like the TV-IP602WN support 300Mbps (when used with a router that supports 300Mbps)- There are some things that could be improved in the setup interface. For example the status page doesn't indicate what the current interface in use is (WiFi or Ethernet). The factory reset button should have a confirm dialog. The firmware update appears to hang when the \"Upload\" button is clicked but this is normal operation. (It may appear to hang for a minute or so, do not unplug the camera!)- Like most cameras I find the power cord should be longer as often an outlet isn't close by.***FEB2012 CRITICAL UPDATE*** If you have one of these TV-IP312WN cameras (H/W version 1.xR) there is a critical firmware update to fix a security issue where anyone can view images from this camera, BYPASSING ANY AUTHENTICATION. It is critical that you update the firmware if it is lower than 1.1.1 Build 33 to fix this security problem (which in my opinion should not have happened). (To avoid possible corruption/damage during the update do not update the firmware using WiFi).OVERALL, it`s a decent cam for indoor use, but in my opinion overpriced due to the night vision and lack of a true IR filter for accurate outdoor colors. Be sure to check out the TRENDnet TV-IP602WN ProView Wireless Pan/Tilt/Zoom Internet Surveillance Camera, which may be the same price as the 312N (but doesn't have IR LEDs)I hope you find this useful!", "Date": "February 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love this Camera", "Author": "sparkle7337", "ReviewID": "R1O60AUQ8PGOYF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Most people will need a little help setting this camera up but once it is up it is so easy to use.  The only issue I had is that the software for the camera only works with a pc and I have a mac. This means I can monitor from my mac but I cannot listen or talk. That is one of the reasons I purchased this camera.  However, I liked the camera enough that I settled by setting up a simple older pc laptop and I use that for the other features.  Not optimum but it works!Overall, I will definitely buy it again and just continue to encourage the company to be MAC friendly.", "Date": "February 22, 2011"}, {"Title": "Absolutely Awesome!!!", "Author": "M.

My wife had purchased a small dedicated baby monitor for use in the nursery, and you could barely see anything with it.  This thing provides a very sharp display.I'd been shopping for one of these for some time.  I finally decided on this model because for the most part, those who have any knowledge of computers thought it was great.  Those that don't have a good understanding of computers and how to set up IP's and get into the routers should probably get a wired camera.Pros:  Low light works great.  Daylight has some color issues, but I didn't get it to take 10mp pictures to develop.  while the colors may not be great, the contrast and sharpness is definitely there.  We haven't tried to use the speaker that hooks up to the camera, maybe when our little one is older and we move this by the front door!  The provided software works as advertised, not great but not horrible.  I've used it create audible alerts based on motion detection and I've recorded my child's movements throughout the night, saving to a NAS.Cons: it wasn't cheaper.  I would like it to have a larger range of focus.  It has frozen up on me twice.  The unit gets pretty warm. Sound tends to lag picture.Thoughts: if you want a monitor that will give you a crisp view of what's going on with your kid, and you want to be able to record it and view it from any computer in the house, then this is for you!Enjoy.", "Date": "December 5, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great quality, unique for the price", "Author": "Brian Roediger \"-Podcaster, Tech head, Husband\"", "ReviewID": "R3FXZGOBK0XV4R", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great product, good quality.

It works great and is much better than the stand alone, purpose-built systems that you can buy.  The camera does what it says it will, and works great in total darkness.The other reviews that discuss the horrible documentation are right though.  The manual that comes with it is scarce on specifics.  It does take some time and finesse to set it up with your wireless system, but if you're computer literate or just willing to put in the time you'll figure it out.  I have yet to set it up as an internet camera, so I can't speak to that, but given the documentation and support issues, if that's your primary purpose and you're not tech savvy, you may want to look elsewhere.Bottom line, its a good camera, provides a nice picture with excellent in room IR capabilities, the software is simple and very functional, it has two way audio and is priced right.
