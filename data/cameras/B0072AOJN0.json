There are so many settings to play with also.  Be prepared to go online to download the manual as this shipped direct from Japan and took about two weeks.  So happy I waited, definitely worth it and Amazon has the best price.", "Date": "March 9, 2014"}, {"Title": "FinePix Z1000EXR Very Versitile", "Author": "Andy \"barn\"", "ReviewID": "R20CPK7MWYOTL8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera does take some time to learn the basic operation. Because the written manual was not in English made it tougher because than I had to use the online manual, and it is difficult to mark with my pencil.I am not there completely, but the camera has lots of great options. I particularly like using the viewing screen as the shutter button because it cuts down on the movement in the camera when shooting any subject.Quality of picture is great as well. And I will try to remember to come back to add more comments with my learning curve gets better. Another think I like is I don't have a tendency of setting it down somewhere and leaving it somewhere when I am out and about. I just stick it in a pocket.My rating will change to 5 star when I learn all the options.", "Date": "February 1, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0072AOJN0"}}
