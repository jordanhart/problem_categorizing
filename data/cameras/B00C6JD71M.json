So far I have come across a few cons to the camera: no view finder which makes it hard to use it out in the bright sunlight even with the larger screen, the videos come out in \"movie\" format rather than the \"AVI\" format that my software recognises. I have to change each video clip's format so I can open and view them, there are two mechanisms to go from wide angle to telephoto and both are a bit slow to change the power and is not smooth. In spite of these few cons, I find the rest of the camera enjoyable and will keep it. I like the color as well, easier than the black casings for my eyes to see the buttons, etc.", "Date": "June 6, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nikon L810 Disappointment", "Author": "Charlotte Otto", "ReviewID": "R3PDCJWXPRNNGL", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I had been looking at this camera and thought this would fit the bill after using a Canon Rebel, which was having some technical issues the last 2 years.  I showed this to my spouse and surprisingly he bought it for me for Mother's Day.  Upon initial use, I had great difficulty, getting a clear image. Issues were focus, and lag time producing the picture I had taken.  So based on the 16 MP and the 30 X zoom, I had hoped for a really responsive camera. I am unhappy to say, it's pics are just so so. I am also frustrated with the quick battery replacement needed, and feel that I would need to have bought the recharging batteries and charger from the get go.  So it is possible that my earliest photos were so awful because I used an SD card from another camera and had not formatted it to this camera ... so not having done so, I had some blurry photos. I also didn't think the scene selections had anything to do with it ... After using the Rebel , I am afraid this isn't the quality I had hoped it would be. I did love the look and the feel, very lightweight, for my petite hands.", "Date": "June 23, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$399.95", "Features": "16MP Back Side Illuminated CMOS Sensor\n4.0-120mm f/3.0-5.8 NIKKOR Zoom Lens\n22.5-675mm 35mm Equivalent Focal Length\n30x Optical Zoom and up to 4x Digital + 3\" LCD Display with 921k-dot Resolution\nFull HD 1080p Video with Stereo Sound + Optical VR Image Stabilization System", "Name": "Nikon COOLPIX L820 16 MP Digital Camera with 30x Zoom (Plum)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41gX2LFt4iL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00C6JD71M"}}
