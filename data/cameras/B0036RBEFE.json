{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent Point-And-Shoot with GPS and Super Zoom", "Author": "e6bwhiz \"e6bwhiz\"", "ReviewID": "R3D96EY5W5Y863", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "For what it is, this is a pretty decent camera.  After playing with it for while I've concluded it has quite a bit of features, many of which I probably won't use.  For instance, the camera has a setting where it will learn commonly photographed people's faces and remember how you want them to be exposed.The camera can be used in full manual mode, aperture priority and shutter priority.  In manual mode the longest shutter time is 16 seconds.  I've experimented with some long exposures and notice the photo is \"processing\" for about the same amount of time that is was exposed.  I'm guessing it may take another photo with the shutter closed, and then compare the two for error correction.  The manual doesn't say anything about this and there are no options.  I've simply seen this on other cameras.In addition to the shutter, aperture and manual modes there are two auto modes.  One is called Smart Auto.  Auto gives you fewer options than program mode.  It seems to simply choose some of the options for you.  Smart Auto gives almost no options and is supposed to automatically sense just about everything about the scene you are photographing.  While taking various shots around the house and yard I've actually found some of the best shots coming from the Smart Auto mode.  I suspect Smart Auto mode to use battery power faster as I can hear it doing something just moving the camera around to different types of scenes.Optical stabilization is a menu item.  Dual stabilization also adds digital stabilization and is only available in the Dual mode.  This mode is selected on the top mode selector and is separate from P A S M, etc.  This mode does give options similar to the Auto mode.The camera records decent video on the highest quality settings.  It saves the clips as an mp4 file.  A huge plus for me is the dedicated video record button on the upper right of the back of the camera.  No need to switch modes.  Just hit that button and it begins recording at the previously set video settings.  You are able to cut out clips from your video on the camera and it will save them as a separate file.  The video may record with stereo sound.  The manual seems to indicate there are two microphones.  You can zoom while recording video, but the noise it creates is quite evident on the playback.  Not a big deal to me.  You have the option to not record sound or have the sound not record during operation of the zoom.  A neat feature they included was the miniature setting.  This is available in video and photo modes.  I would have liked to see a time lapse video function.  My little Canon SD1000 can do time lapse and will miss it when using the HZ35W.I've read where some people don't see the GPS become available for a long time.  I went outside, reset the GPS in the settings and I had a good signal after about 3 minutes.  I don't know if resetting the GPS helped, but from what I read in the manual it seems to make sense to do so if you have relocated to a place far from the last time it had satellites.  From my experience with other GPS receivers you pretty much have to be outside to get a good signal, so I imagine it is the same here.I've also read of people wondering about the images being saved at 96 PPI (pixels per inch).  I took several test shots and looked up the data in my image viewing program.  I'm doing a simple comparison to a Canon 7.1 MP camera I have which saves at 180 PPI.Samsung at 12 MP Auto and P modes:Resolution:  4000 x 3000File Size:  4.878 MBCompressed BPP:  3.98096Image Dimensions:  41.67\" x 31.25\"Samsung at 12 MP Smart Auto mode:Resolution:  4000 x 3000File Size:  2.708 MBCompressed BPP:  2.15496Image Dimensions:  41.67\" x 31.25\"Samsung at 8 MP Auto and P modes:Resolution:  3264 x 2448File Size:  3.261 MBCompressed BPP:  3.93331Image Dimensions:  34\" x 25.50\"Samsung at 5 MP Auto and P modes:Resolution:  2560 x 1920File Size:  2.026 MBCompressed BPP:  3.86542Image Dimensions:  26.67\" x 20.00\"Canon SD1000 at 7.1 MPResolution:  3072 x 2304File Size:  3.217 MBCompressed BPP:  5.0Image Dimensions:  17.07\" x 12.80\"From this we can see a few things.  First, Smart Auto mode cuts the file size in half and the amount of info saved per pixel is less.  I can't find an option to adjust the jpeg compression and don't fully understand what is happening here yet.  The Canon is set to use the best quality jpeg options.  We can also see the image PPI are simply saved at a smaller value on the Samsung, hence the larger image dimensions.  For instance on the 12 MP Samsung image:  Multiply the 96 PPI by 41.67 inches.  You will get the listed horizontal resolution of 4000.  Samsung could have just as easily saved the PPI larger and it would have equated to smaller calculated image dimensions.  So if you view your image so it is 41.67\" x 31.25\" (huge!) then, yes, it will be 96 pixels per inch.  I'm sure someone will correct me, but I think when you view or print the image smaller more information will be crammed into the smaller space and the apparent quality will increase.  Additionally, when selecting a megapixel size the camera states the max recommended print size.  For 12 MP it states 33.1\" x 23.3\", which equates to approx 121 PPI.Pros:Lots of settings and effects to play with.  Dedicated video recording button.  SD cards good up to 16 GB.  Bright screen.  Fairly good images for a point-and-shoot (including low-light).  Easy to switch to Smart Auto if handing the camera off to someone who doesn't know cameras.  GPS tagging.  Nice zoom.  HDMI output.  Camera does have internal memory to store photos on (unfortunately only about 3 images at 12 MP!)Cons:Digital zoom can't be disabled (although it is not available in certain modes).  Doesn't come with an SD storage card or case.  Manual doesn't explain features and settings enough.  Image jpeg compression options seem to be non-existent.  Some settings in P mode will be reset when turning off the camera (like the Auto Contrast Balance).  This option-resetting may occur in other modes as well, I haven't experimented enough.  After taking a shot utilizing the flash the camera won't respond to input until the flash is charged again.  Battery is charged while inside the camera, but the cord to connect it to an outlet is only about a foot long, maybe less.  You have to find an outlet close to a shelf or something to set the camera on.Conclusion:This is just a preliminary review and I haven't spent too much time experimenting with the camera.  This camera is a good choice if you are looking for a compact design, great zoom, GPS (outdoor use), good video and the ability to occasionally adjust the settings (aperture, shutter, etc.).  It's just not going to give you the quality of a DSLR.  Photos can look a bit grainy.  I'm not sure why, perhaps in part due to the massive jpeg compression that's going on.  I have a 5 MP Olympus that produces larger jpeg file sizes and its images can look better than the Samsung.  If you are worried about the camera's size, it is larger than a subcompact, but I think the features outweigh the inconvenience of the size increase.*Update*I've since experimented with Samsungs jpeg compression options.  There are three: Super Fine, Fine and Normal.  The mode Auto Smart will only take images at Fine quality.  Here is some more info to compare.  I took four shots at 12 MP:Auto SmartFile Size:  2.705 MB2.15034 BPP (bits per pixel)Auto with Super FineFile Size:  4.737 MB3.86252 BPPAuto with FineFile Size:  2.668 MB2.12106 BPPAuto with NormalFile Size:  1.834 MB1.42007 BPPIt seems evident what Auto Smart is doing.  It's a shame you can't improve the compression quality for Auto Smart because it is actually doing a pretty good job of analyzing the scene and choosing the best options.  Auto Smart is also available in the movie mode.I tend to partially block the flash when holding the camera.  It takes a little practice placing your fingers in a place that won't block the flash and IR light while still keeping a good grip on the body.  I guess sacrifices have to be made to cram all this stuff in a compact body.  I would have liked to see the flash on the other side of the lens, although not having a pop-up flash is nice.I just started using a 16 GB Ultra SD card.  It will hold 2,313 images at 12 MP on Super Fine (Auto) or 3 hours 22 minutes video on the best quality settings.  These numbers will decrease after other items are loaded on the card, like GPS maps, etc.", "Date": "April 28, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great camera with a bundle of neat features.", "Author": "Kindle Customer \"racersimage\"", "ReviewID": "R3R22G572ZI9G3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Against the grain of reviews here I ordered one of these HZ35W's.  I love the camera so far.  It feels very sturdy.  I did have a Kodak Z950 which has the same megapixels but only 10x zoom and no GPS.I chose this HZ35W over the HZ30W for the GPS.  It didn't take long before I got frustrated over this GPS feature because the GPS capture is very slow at first.  Downloading and installing the maps could have been easier as well.  I actually had to check out a forum where someone posted screenshots of their directories on the SD Card that were using had to figure out how it was done.  I also had to change the power saving settings to never turn the camera off because if not the GPS signal would never come through.  I finally got it tonight and inside my house even.  It took about 45 minutes of leaving the camera still to acquire the GPS signal but now that it's got it, it picks it up quick.Overall I am very satisfied with the pictures.  Quality is about the same as the Kodak Z950 but the zoom is much better with having 5X more optical zoom then the Kodak and the colors are sharper as well.  Low light pictures are great too, I can take a picture in low light and it comes out very bright and colorful.  The HD video quality and sound is also better than the Kodak and the file size is half the size of what I was used to so uploading to YouTube is much less of a pain not having to wait as long.I chose this one over the Sony HX5 because the color is off when taking pictures in the sunlight on the Sony, they're too yellow in my opinion.  The Samsung seems to shoot the scene more true to life in regards to the lighting and colors.  Now that I've acquired my GPS signal and ensured that it works I'm very pleased with my purchase.  Another day and I could have gotten it for $20 less but stuff like that happens.I'd definitely grab them up while they're still on sale for $299.  If you can be patient for up to 45 minutes or so then I'd say you should finally get a GPS signal, it really shouldn't take that long but like I said, I left it indoors to acquire it's first signal...outside should provide better results.  Other than that, I have no reason not to recommend this Samsung HZ35W.", "Date": "April 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Some good. Some bad. Overall, I'm pleased.", "Author": "Jay Gourley", "ReviewID": "R2NMAXFUQCKMR1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought two. At the time in March 2010, there were only two or three compacts offering comparable zoom range and gps geotagging. I'm pleased with this purchase. But since most readers will be interested in the bad news, I'll start there:The Bad:GPS map display DOES NOT WORK FOR THE TIME BEING. This is not important to me because the Geotagging does work, but this non-existent map-displaying feature has been praised by ill-advised reviewers. Samsung aknowledges the problem, says it applies to all US models but no UK models, and says it is working on a fix.(Related problem: Samsung told me it does not plan to offer maps for much of the developing world.)Manufacturing quality is below average (except for lens). One camera was a missing screw in the base.Tech support is below average.The camera does not use GPS time!  Only user-set time. This is the kind of thing that makes me worry about the overall design, but I haven't found any other design flaws this bad.It doesn't display geographic coordinates it tags to images. The coordinates are recorded in the meta-data and you can see them when you get back to your PC, but you'll never find out what they are from the camera.There's no exposure longer than 16 seconds, which doesn't matter because the low-light noise is bad, like all other compact digital cameras I've used.It takes a long time, more than 10 minutes, for the GPS receiver to lock onto satellites after being off for a few hours (satellites move, don't they). If it's turned on within several minutes of having located itself, GPS acquisition is reasonably fast. Luckily, there is a setting on the camera that allows you to turn the GPS on with the lens retracted. So you can turn it on well before you plan to take pictures and give it time to acquire statellites.The good:This new lens is fantastic. I'm blown away by the quality when it gets enough light, even at extreme ends of the zoom range and at full aperature. The zoom range on this lens pushes the limits of compact cameras, but it does at least as good a job as most compact lenses I've used with much smaller zoom ranges.  I love it.The image stabilization is fantastic.  Even pushed in to extreme telephoto and even at shutter speeds where I'd expect blurring, the crispness of the images surprised me. The video is also unexpectedly stable when pushed in. I'm used to much worse from compact cameras and really thought this would be a big problem on a camera with such extreme telephoto.I can charge the battery without an AC adapter through any USB power source. This won't matter to some people, but it was a deal-closer for me.LED display lives up to Samsung's marketing hype.GPS accuracy is pretty good for a receiver this small (within 30 yards in handful of tests).Auto-focus is good and fast.The Wait and See:I haven't figured out memory formatting.  My  Windows Vista PC does not read the memory card.  So I have to transfer pictures through the camera.  It's probably just a problem with me and the camera documentation.Durability.  The first reason I buy a compact is to have it with me.  So I'll learn soon enough how durable it is.  Too bad this kind of information is never available on leading-edge products.

So far the camera has been easy to use and takes great pictures.  My biggest complaint is the GPS feature.  I could not get the GPS to sync with any satellites.  It turns out after several calls to technical support, that Samsung is not yet supporting the GPS mode in the US and will only gaurantee GPS in the UK.  They have no estimate as to when they will activate GPS for the US or for the rest of the world for that matter.Additionally, I would agree with the other reviews in that the manuals for the camera are incomplete.On the positive side, the AMOLED screen is amazing!", "Date": "April 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Europe Trip", "Author": "Raymond J.

Rehm", "ReviewID": "RUVFSRB0VBWF0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I just finished a month-long trip to France and Italy with this camera.  I was really happy to have such a light and small camera that could take great, sharp shots, deep zoom and beautiful color OLED LCD display for reviewing the day's photos with my wife while at dinner. Take a look at [...] for the pictures, albeit at reduced resolution.For about 1.5 weeks, I hiked over 100 km of the French GR6 trail from just east of Avignon to Sisteron in the Les Alps d'Haute Provence.  While hiking, I really wanted geo-coded pictures to post on my travel blog. I kept the camera in a pouch secured to my pack's shoulder strap so I could grab it quickly.  I took pictures perhaps every 15-45 min.  In general, I got a new GPS fix very quickly (15-20 sec, at most).  Sometimes I would have to wait 1-2 minutes...yes sometimes annoying, but generally it gave me time to get a drink of water, look around and think about the shot I was going to take and enjoy the scenery.  That's what \"slow travel\" is all about anyway.  FYI, I could not get a GPS fix in fast-moving French TGV or Teoz trains.Before the trip, I took the time to download the maps of US, France and Italy, following instructions found on the Samsung UK website for the identical model WB650.  That said, I didn't use the camera's map feature all that much since I had an iPhone as well as paper topo maps with a lot more local detail.The 15x zoom along with optical+digital image stablization really great for being able to take interesting shots of people without being close or faraway coastal details without being there (yet).One thing I feature I wish the camera was the ability to turn *off* the LCD.  This is a feature that my waterproof Pentax Optio WP has.  It's nice sometimes when you know you're going to take a series of photos over, say, the next 5-10 minutes.  Rather than turning the camera on/off and waiting that usually brief period for a GPS fix, I would rather keep the camera and GPS on and just turn the display off.  On my Pentax Optio WP, this is just one more display mode that you can cycle through using the up/down buttons on the 4-way wobble pad.Definitely buy an extra battery.  At least once, while waiting for GPS fix after a large change in distance, I left the camera on in \"map mode\", and drained the battery.My other cameras are the Optio mentioned above and a Nikon D200 with a Red Hen bluetooth adapter that syncs with a candy-bar sized bluetooh GPS receiver.  The Optio just isn't good enough for a nice trip like this where I can keep the camera dry.  But the Nikeon D200 is just too big and I would be out lots more money to get a 15x zoom.  This camera was \"just right\".I would give the product 5 stars if Samsung USA really supported the map feature in a user-friendly way, e.g., with a PC/Mac or Web app that would properly create and populate the directory structure on the SDHC card with the maps you select.  Also, Samsung's limit of three download attempts for each map is idiotic.  Is this really supposed to be some sort of security?  I called Samsung's \"Customer Experience\" department to let them know that the dropped the ball here.So, I'm really happy with this camera for travelling and look forward to bringing it along on future trips.", "Date": "June 24, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera freezes!", "Author": "William A", "ReviewID": "R1CN9X110ZAUQ0", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Bought camera through Amazon & J&R; Camera. Feature rich camera. Liked the zoom range. Camera came two days after I ordered it. Very nice. Charged battery fully and took it out the next day to test outdoors in the park. The temp was cool, in the mid forties. After taking several pictures the camera locked up. The power light was on and the screen active, but there was no button I could push(including the power button)to take control of the camera. After a few minutes I gave up and pulled the battery out. I re-inserted the battery and the camera seemed to return to normal. A few more pictures later the same thing happened again. Maybe it was the cool temp or maybe it was just a lemon. I'm thinking this camera was a pre-released version because it was not widely available at the time. Early adopters take their chances. I sent the camera back not wanting to get stuck with a lemon. I tried to load maps on to the gps in the camera. There is almost no docs on how to do that. I gave up before I could suceed. The pictures I took were ok but not what you expect from dslr.

I would like to address the GPS complaints people have mentioned. First off, this is a camera not a GPS. The GPS did take a long time (about 20 min) to get a fix the first time I turned it on. Since then, as long as I an in the same general area as my previous gps fix, it will get a fast fix. If you move , Lets say 75 miles or so, it will take a bit longer to get a fix. The zoom is excellent! I have a canon DSLR with a 75-300mm ultrasonic lense. The samsung will bring objects in closer than my canon! Granted the final part of the zoom is digital, but it is one of the best digital zooms I  have used. People are very amazed at the quality of pictures I took at night. The day pictures are great too. People are also amazed how feature packed this camera is compared to its size. Get a SD card of at least 8gb to accomodate the mapping software and high res pictures.The only reason I didn't give 5 stars: Lack of small pocket sized manual, Mapping software instructions make loading and prepping a little difficult (samsung could have made the process dag and drop from the CD, lack of photo stitch on the fly, no Sepia?, Classic = B&W;? , No 1080 video?

That said, it's been a while since I've had to upgrade my point and shoot.  I own a Nikon D700 and am used to that kind of quality.This camera is smaller than I was expecting.  I bought it because I wanted great photos in a smaller camera.  So I was expecting kind of a beast, but it's not.  I had even cut out its dimensions on a piece of paper, and it came feeling smaller than I thought it would.I love the big display on the back, and that you can see your photos on the back of your camera in bright light.  It does it's own \"sharpening\" for your display (notice when you flip through pictures, it's a little not sharp, then it sharpens up for you.)  This is a software thing, not actually your photo.  HOWEVER,  when you download your photos to your computer, and you zoom in 100%, there are some serious issues.  The photos look over sharpened, and pixelated.  The only way I can accept this, and give this camera an overall rating of 4, is that if you were going to print these photos at 150dpi (the lowest you should) your print size could go all the way up to 20 inches x 26 inches.  Not something I ever plan to do.  And if you wanted a more reasonable 300dpi, your prints could go up to 10 x 13 - a much more reasonable size.  I need to actually print a photo at this size to tell you if it really is as bad as when you zoom in at 100% (which is the same thing as not having changed the resolution or dimensions at all.)  The difference for me is that I plan to print my photos more at 300dpi and 4.5 x 6 inches.  Crop to these dimensions, and the photo looks and will print a lot better - not so much pixelization or over sharpening.  (In essence, it's like looking at your photo not quite zoomed in to 100% before the crop.  It just looks better.)  I'm using Photoshop CS4 for all of this.  So for me, I just have to be realistic about how I'm going to print these photos.It seems to take a second longer to focus than I expect it should, meaning missed shots, which IS a disappointment.I have not had a problem with colors, like some other reviewers have, as long as the camera has chosen the right exposure.  (If it's not exposed correctly, then forget getting your colors right.)I bought a 32G sdhc card, and my camera has twice \"frozen\" like a computer will freeze and you have to reboot.  The only way to reboot it is to disengage the battery.  This is obnoxious considering I paid three fifty for it, and I HOPE it's just that I bought the wrong size card.  (Samsung will only guarantee up to 8g sdhc.)  I'll have to get it and update my review.I LOVE the wide angle this camera can get.  It's amazing how much more can fit in the photo than my last point and shoot.Anyway, I hope this review helps you in making your decision.

It is fully automatic and fully manual with the ability to take HD video and has a great Amoled screen which is excellent in bright sunlight. The photos and video I took during my vacation were outstanding. I kept the camera strapped to my backpack the whole trip. It was durable and easy to use. Other reviews were negative regarding the GPS feature but that was not a deal killer for me as I did not and probably will never use that feature. I would recommend getting a second battery to swap out when one goes down.

I purchased this camera because of the 15X optical magnification.  It is rated as 14 megapixels in some of Samsung's literature, but is really 12MP.  I also bought this camera because of the Amoled LCD display which does not wash out as much as the usual displays.  The GPS feature is also one of the reasons for my purchase.  The download for maps and locations to be used for the GPS function, supposedly compatible with the Samsung WB650, does not work.  Samsung Technical Support by phone explains that the company is working to correct this problem, but has not done so to date.  There is supposed to be maps downloadable for many countries, but none for China.  It is not a surprise that China would not want GPS information for their country on cameras, etc.  Unfortunately, there is no RAW capture capability with this camera.  There are many functions for automatically setting the camera for scenes, red eye removal, and smart auto which detects and adjusts exposure for the type of photo to be taken.  Aperture, speed and manual settings are accessible. There are modes to recognize registered faces, detect blinking of subject's eyes and remove facial skin blemishes, as well as tracking.  There are a number of additonal creative capabilities that can be set.

I needed something small that fits in my jeans and still takes decent photos. My primary needs were for a small size, good megapixels, good optical zoom, HD video, and overall quality of photos.

Manual controls require digging through menu and that takes some time. There are very few buttons and most adjustments should be done via the menu. I'd love a zoom ring like you get on detachable lenses and manual focus (wishful thinking).

You just have to accept that it works when it feels like it, and you'll be happier. My HTC Fuze, which has a so-so GPS, got a fix somewhat more often then the camera; On the other hand, I was in Italy, and even devices specifically built for GPS--and only GPS--seem to have issues there, as evidenced by other reviews on Amazon. It is nice when it works, though! One time, I was able to use the map view as a substitute map to figure out where I was, although it is definitely not designed to work as a general purpose GPS device.The instructions for putting the maps on the SD card are really not that hard to follow, with one caveat: Each set of maps has a file bgmap.cfg. So, although you can load up maps of several areas, you can (apparently) only have one of these active at a time, so you have to have a way to rename the file outside of the camera. (So, in the USA, make that one bgmap.cfg, and rename the Italy one bgmapITA.cfg. When you get to Italy, reverse the process).Another downside is that *nobody* in brick-and-mortar land carries accessories for this camera, although you can find some things here. The charger I bought (Compact Battery Charger Set for Samsung SLB-10A / 11A) didn't actually charge the battery: I'm trying to get my money back. (Really stinks to find that out on vacation, but the built-in charger works reasonably well; you just can't charge one battery while using the other one). On the bright side, the Tamrac 5217 T17 Digital Camera Bag (Chili) fits the camera, a couple of SDHC cards in their plastic thingies, and the battery quite nicely.The camera has no orientation sensor to tell which way you are holding it, so you have to manually rotate all your pictures. The software that comes with the camera is pretty nice, it automatically puts your pictures into separate folders by date. I would have preferred that the camera actually do it on the card itself, but this isn't a bad compromise.On the positive side, the thing takes pretty good pictures. The zoom is wonderful, and it has more features than I'll probably ever use, but are nice to have. (There's one where you can set up the camera, go get in the picture, and wave your hands to trigger the timer. Another tells you if you're in the picture if you're one of those who holds the camera at arm's length and takes your own picture). It is reasonably small, fires up quickly, and the controls are easy to use.One of the reviews here rants about DPI. I was a bit concerned until I googled it, and found that the knowledgable sites all said that DPI doesn't matter. Pixels matter, JPEG quality matters, but DPI doesn't.I've gone back and forth with my last several cameras between big zoom and tiny camera. If you're like me, but are in the tiny camera phase, my wife's Canon PowerShot SD1400IS 14.1 MP Digital Camera with 4x Wide Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom and 2.7-Inch LCD (Orange) camera is a fantastic tiny camera that she can carry everywhere. If I weren't in my \"big zoom\" phase, that's what I would buy, because this camera is just a bit too big to carry *everywhere*, even though it is really amazingly small for what it delivers, and I never felt burdened with it during our trip; it just isn't an \"everywhere\" camera. (It is a bit hard to explain, so I'll try to illustrate. I would carry an iPod classic around if I thought I might want to listen to music, but I do carry the nano everywhere, because it is just *so* small that it doesn't matter). I certainly carry this camera a lot more than my last big zoom camera.The OLED display is really nice, much better than LED displays. In really bright light, however, you are still a bit in the \"point and pray\" mode, but actual viewfinders are pretty rare these days. Still, it came through in almost every shot, and a whole lot more than others I've used.The instruction manual, which is online--although you could print it out if you really wanted too--is 113 pages long, and even at that, probably doesn't cover everything as much as it could. But it is reasonably complete, and I can't say as I blame them too much: There's a lot of information there, and most people won't even look at it.In summary, every camera has its trade-offs. Although I complained a lot about some of this one's features, overall I'm happy with it, and I can always steal my wife's camera if I need something really small!", "Date": "June 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "GPS a waste -- or worse", "Author": "Honest Abe", "ReviewID": "R37UGQ6IPV1Y0H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The GPS often shows photos taken 180 degrees around the world from where you shoot them.

At the time, the Panasonic was considered top of the class with a 6x zoom, very good image quality and 6MP resolution.  In comparison to the Samsung, all I can say is what a piece of junk..  The Samsung has a far better screen for viewing pictures, the zoom is incredible, the user interface is very nice and the low-light performance is worlds above.  As a quick example of the last bit, I took some sample pictures in my office of a stack of CDs across the room.  The flash was turned off on both cameras and it was near sunset outside, but not quite dark enough where I had to turn a light on yet.  At identical zoom lengths, the picture taken with the Panasonic was almost unrecognizable; you could see the horizontal lines created by the different CD cases, but you really couldn't make out any of the titles printed on their spines.  The picture was overall very dark and \"noisy\".  The picture taken with the Samsung, in contrast, was relatively sharp and bright with the CD titles clearly legible.  Pictures taken of peoples faces, junk stacked in the closet and other indoor stuff all showed the same large improvement in image quality of the Samsung.So why do I mention all of this about low-light performance compared to an older camera?  Because for me the biggest trouble I had was in deciding between this camera with its larger zoom and the latest crop of digital cameras with larger sensors (such as the Canon G11 and S90).  True, the Samsung might not be able to match these cameras in low-light performance, but if you're buying this camera as a replacement for a point & shoot that's a few years old, you'll be blown away with how much better low-light performance is anyways...I wish I could also comment on the GPS, software and macro features of this camera, but I'm afraid I haven't played with these yet..PS- It's also worth mentioning that, for my hands, the Samsung is also a more comfortable camera to hold onto than the Panasonic DMC-ZS7.", "Date": "August 8, 2010"}, {"Title": "ok except for the zoom!!!", "Author": "brian", "ReviewID": "R2ZW3P0OS4IX6D", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I hope someone from Samsung sees this.

Previously I had two Canons which had plusses and minuses.

Since when did individualism become an imperfection?)  I've had the HZ35W digital camera now for a few days and so far, I'm not impressed whatsoever due to the quality of the images once downloaded to my computer. My older Canon SD800 IS (28mm wide) takes much better pictures simply by using Auto. I can download the pictures taken from my Canon and open them in Photoshop, and I'm ready to print with just a few minor adjustments. The images are clean, very sharp and at least 180 dpi -- and yes bashers, I know the difference between pixels and resolution. As a non-sequiter, Canon's Japanese engineers have since eliminated the \"super fine\" compression ratio and thusly their new product line (S90, SD980, etc.) will produce no greater image than your cell phone camera! I've tested quite a few from their new line.With the Samsung HZ35W, after having taken several hundred test shots, I've discovered that all the pictures are noisy, and are recorded at only 96 dpi, despite changing the image quality setting on the camera. I've confirmed that I have the best resolution settings on but it doesn't matter. Whether I use the \"normal\", \"fine\" or \"super fine\" JPEG compression ration, all images come out looking the same. I called Samsung customer support and was directed to a guy in Tier 2 support who was completely off his rocker, uninformed and didn't care about the problem -- uncanny for Samsung's customer support! Often, he just sat there in complete silence and (in poor English) asked \"Iie [is] that it?\" He told me that the AMOLED display determines the picture resolution and I told the guy he didn't know what he was talking about. The display on the camera is just to show the user the image and does not determine the actual quality of the image!I've tested the various settings of megapixels and the image quality; it makes no difference. All images come out at 96 dpi (VERY LOW QUALITY and cannot be printed on high quality printer paper), and the images are very noisy/grainy.  Some of the reviews here are from people who either do not have the \"eye\", or have limited knowledge of what should result from higher end P&S; cameras, especially from one as loaded as this one!. However, don't take my word for it, drop the money and see for yourself. If you have a trained eye, you'll see it! Again, if you allegorize this to HD movies, there are still plenty of folks out there who cannot tell the difference between a Standard Def movie and a High Def one.Finally, I called Samsung customer support again last night and provided my \"transaction\" number again hoping to speak to a different tier 2 tech; naturally the same guy answered. Ultimately, Samsung paid for me to send in the camera for \"repair,\" but I suspect 96 dpi *IS* the result of all recorded images. Perhaps someone on here can confirm in their review.This camera, so far, has not yielded the quality I have come to expect from Samsung and while the features of this camera (e.g. 15x optical zoom, 24mm wide angle, etc.) are very appealing, please consider whether or not you will be printing your images and how clear, crisp and vibrant you want your pictures to be. I tested several shooting conditions from: indoors with contrasting furniture that has sharp lines, colored pencils and books (to test the sharpness and color saturation), and outdoors to test natural lighting and other elements. In nearly all the pictures, lines were blurred between reds and browns, greens and blues simply didn't standout, blacks were too flat, the contrast and sharpness (although adjustable in some modes) just simply fall well below the mark for this to be considered a higher-end camera!Some of the features would otherwise be terrific, if only the camera's recorded images were recorded at a higher dpi! I've tested several post-editing programs as well as comparing the recorded images from my comeras. Each post-editing program (even just reviewing them in a basic image review program with no editing tools), the Samsung images are still at 96 dpi, while Canon's are 180dpi. So to anynoe who wants to claim that my post-editing program is the problem, then I ask how is it that images from a different camera come in at a higher resolution?The Dual IS mode is nice; however, most of my images still came out very dark and grainy (the flash doesn't seem to function on this mode). If you're considering this camera to take pictures of the moon (telescope) then this is the camera for you, but if you want a camera to provide crisp, clear, life-like images of friends, family outings, vacations, etc. then this is NOT the camera for you.I realize this is a P&S;, but I've had P&S; cameras in the past that produce much better images than this one, with colors more vibrant, lines sharper, better contrast with more depth. I realize this review is going to get bashed but at least I'm not just restating all the positives that have already been stated in countless other online review site, and at least I ACTUALLY OWN the camera (some people post reviews and don't even own the item!).
