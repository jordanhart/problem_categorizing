This is a great camera, but it's complicated scene modes make it a bit frustrating if you don't know EXACTLY what you're doing.  The scene mode also resets every time you turn off the camera.  The camera is ready to take pictures almost instantly after pushing the \"on\" button, but the focus and shutter speed make it hard to catch impromptu photos.  People fall asleep waiting for the flash.  The camera is durable but the LCD scratches easily. BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR IMMEDIATELY!  Excellent batterly life.  Awesome review features and good balance of weight and size.  This is not your Father's camera.  It's high quality, durable, and portable camera. It takes great pictures...if you can figure out how to take them!Ryan", "Date": "January 11, 2007"}, {"Title": "Olympus Quality Continues", "Author": "R. Susnjer", "ReviewID": "R2HXPVLPXYPXXV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have owned and used Olympus camera equipment since the early 70's and have never been disappointed.  The Stylus 730 is another fine example of quality at an affordable price.  The camera is very small yet easy to use due to its well thought out design and construction. The LCD is very large and clear.  And, the controls are easy to use for even a person with large hands like me (once you take the time to learn how to use them).I purchased this camera for my wife (to replace her existing 35mm Olympus film camera) after she saw and played with one at a local electronics store.  I should also note that my wife doesn't like \"too many buttons\".  So she simply avoids using them and hasn't yet been disappointed.  Thus far, she is extremely pleased with her pictures - so needless to say, so am I.[I included the following on my review for the Olympus Stylus 750 which I purchased at the same time that I purchased this camera.  It is also relevant to this camera.]However, it must be noted that this camera suffers the same problem as all other digital cameras with only a LCD screen for composing your shots.  It is difficult to focus and compose your shot in bright light situations.  I personally wish that this camera had a viewfinder but that's just a personal preference.  And, viewfinders are not common on digital cameras of this ultra compact size anyway.I've noticed that many reviewers unfairly tend to base their reviews on previous cameras that they have owned or used (usually SLR's - film or digital).  One must keep in mind that this camera IS NOT a replacement for a SLR, it doesn't have a viewfinder, it doesn't have interchangeable lens, shutter priorities, does suffer from occasional blurriness, doesn't use AA/AAA batteries, it uses a proprietary xD flash card, has fairly difficult controls/buttons, too many functions, etc.Well - guess what?? This isn't a SLR nor was it designed to replace one!  It's a point and shoot camera no different than the old 135 pocket film cameras.  Authentic Olympus xD cards can be purchased on Amazon or many other internet sites at very reasonable prices [...]And, to make sure that you get the shot you want (because there's no charge for developing film) you take as many shots as you can/want and simply delete those that don't meet your approval.As for too many functions or difficult to use controls - don't use them - there's no one forcing you to use them.  However, you can only benefit from taking the time to learn how to properly use the functions and controls.And, if you can design a better layout for the controls on a camera this small, then you should be working for Olympus.And finally, Amazon must be given credit for executing a perfect transaction.  Great price, excellent communications, safe packaging and relatively fast (Free) shipping.", "Date": "May 10, 2007"}, {"Title": "Some good and some bad features for Olympus 730", "Author": "Richard W. Tribou", "ReviewID": "RU1MOFK5KGAN4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I upgraded to the smaller 730 pocket camera, easier to carry around, from an Olympus D-595 with 5 megapixals, so the functions were similar, and the picture quality is marginally better. Battery life is now poor, so I need to carry around a spare battery and a spare 1 Gig picture card. The movie mode is outstanding in HQ mode with over 25 minutes with a 1Gig card. The worst feature is low light indoor picture taking with flash when I use zoom. From 10 feet away, the camera will not focus the way my old D-595 works. Therefore, I do not use the zoom feature indoors, and must rely on post-processing cropping to enlarge the picture. That is my only real disappointment with the camera.", "Date": "March 23, 2007"}, {"Title": "Poor Picture Quality", "Author": "K.

I have stepped on it, dropped it, lost it in the snow, it has tumbled out of my pocket down dirt trails and gets thrown in my backpack with no case. The only real damage I have done to it is a cracked the back screen, but the screen still works perfectly. I love this camera a lot. It takes great pictures.-There is a guide and it adjusts the mode for close up, super close up, shooting with back light and so many other great features. it takes good action shots. The key to taking them is to focus by pushing the button half way then the second you want the shot to take you finish out the push and it takes the photo instantly.-The video mode does not produce anything amazingly epic, but it does the job. You can take screen shots off video...they again are not great but you can do it. I have taken action videos, they upload to youtube really well, but anything larger size and they are not so great.-There are decoration options on the camera, you can add borders and such. I never really use that option.I use the self timer a lot. It is like 20 seconds or something like that. has come quite in handy many many times.I really like the night photo option. You can take some amazing night shots. Just make sure it has a tripod or something steady to set it on or the photo will be blurry.I have yet to have a digital camera last over a year with the abuse I give it and this one is at a year and a half and still counting.The Large LCD screen is awesome on the back for viewing photos. But make sure you hav it self shut off when not in use or it will eat your battery. Get a spare battery. the annoying thing about the batter is you need to remember the charger and you have to take the battery OUT of the camera and put it in the charger. It would be nicer if you could leave it in the camera and charge the camera and be able to turn it on to upload photos while charging. But I guess this is the case with lots of digital cameras with the lithium batteries.-The battery drains when it is cold! So when i take it snowboarding I keep it in the warmest pocket possible. That is one thing that is very annoying about the camera and my biggest complaint. But if kept warm there is not problem.", "Date": "June 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great compact camera!", "Author": "Brandi", "ReviewID": "R1JD5OV4A3AAZE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: LCD screen, 7.1 MP, compact size, weatherproof (not waterproof)Cons: No underwater housing availableI received this camera as a gift for Christmas 2006.  My uncle, who is an avid photographer, purchased it for me.  I am not a photographer, just a girl who likes to take pictures.  I at first thought the pictures were grainey, until I read up on the camera and changed a few of the settings.  Now, I cannot ask for better shots.  Of course night shots are still always tough for me.  I have posted some of the shots taken with the camera to show you the shots are very clear and crisp.  The size of the camera makes it very easy to carry with you anywhere.  There are all types of preset modes that you can choose from, or you can set manually using the user friendly menu.  I just wish I could find a reliable underwater housing from Olympus...they don't make one for this model.", "Date": "June 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "shutter speed: too slow!", "Author": "A.

I actually have my camera for more than a year now and still, i haven't read my manual so i can't really complain much. But this camera frustrates me though in terms of the shutter speed, it really sucks unless there is a way in the \"manual\" to adjust it. Sometimes image are good but sometimes not. I can't really say if it's a good camera or not but i guess the best way is to read the manual which i am planning to do pretty soon so i won't waste the money that i spent for it.
