One of them died within three months, the other one is still in place, 30 feet apart at most and I get very poor performance.  There is one wall between the receiver and camera but its only an interior sheet rock wall.  In my application, I would have been better served to run a USB line to a wired camera.", "Date": "May 15, 2011"}, {"Title": "$200 in the trash.", "Author": "Yousef Eshmawi \"Y.E.\"", "ReviewID": "R2F5DKYHGUKSAX", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "\"uh, use any webcam software for our product.\" No buddy, I pay you 200 bucks, you make a program to come along with it, jerks.Looked great, but tried a dozen different programs to get this thing to work, one did for 2 seconds at and then kept freezing. There's almost zero troubleshooting content for this thing online, even in forums. And their tech-support staff are not available during the weekends and evenings when most of us aren't at work.The signal will barely go across a while. Poor product, should be pulled off the market.", "Date": "April 22, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't waste your time on Swann SW322 (ADW 200)", "Author": "Aspen_Joe", "ReviewID": "ROBG695D4GRFG", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Hooked up both wireless digital cams to my Swann DVR 8-2600 and they both produce horrible images.  There is no image enhancement capability through the DVR. This was confirmed by Swann Tech Support.  I also have a Foscam FI8918W which i placed side by side with one of the ADW 200 cams and the difference in image resolution & color was night and day.  Going forward, I'll probably continue to use the more secured wired Swann Pro-660 / DVR config for my exterior office surveillance and utilized Foscam FI8918W/FI8910W cams for the interior thereby relying on 2 separate systems.", "Date": "April 26, 2012"}, {"Title": "does not work", "Author": "fflow", "ReviewID": "R30L3TQBA3BWLR", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "The product does not work.I have an IT person, and he cannot get it to work.

I bought 3 additional cameras and had to return each after spending time with Swann technical support trying to get them to work. It was also difficult to get someone on the phone from Swann to help and finally they told me all 3 cameras were defective and needed to be returned.  So 3 out of four camera I bought from Swann did not work at all????  Even the one camera I have gotten to working has problems staying connected and needs to turned on and off to reset the camera after a few weeks of use. I been told by Swann this is a known issue with the camera driver.  So they know they camera has problems yet they continue to sell them???  I do not recommend these cameras because they are not reliable and the support is even worse.", "Date": "March 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "Swann Camera", "Author": "fordco", "ReviewID": "R4NTMIKD5O2XH", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Does not stay connected.
