I took some of a museum exhibit--lots of lights at odd angles, lots of glass and reflections.  The pictures were wonderful!  I also did some at night and outdoors--all came out substantially better than average.For some reason, Samsung does not have a good reputation with some people.

That was with trying to minimize my use of the LCD display to conserve batteries.", "Date": "June 15, 2004"}, {"Title": "Excellent Camera", "Author": "\"mommyto5\"", "ReviewID": "R2HO96VZF2356", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have been very leery of digital cameras as the picture quality of some that I've tried ws not so great.  This camera changed my mind!  I found it on clearance and paid only 129.00 for it so the price for a 4mega pixal camera was excellent.  Not only is it extremely easy to use but the pictures are awesome.  FAr better than the 35mm that i have been using.  It also has the capability to do video w/ sound which is very cool.  The only drawback is that it goes through batteries (AA) like crazy.  Invest in rechargable batteries if you buy this one.  Extremely easy to save your pictures to your PC also.  This is one great camera!", "Date": "April 6, 2004"}, {"Title": "Not what I would call \"point and shoot\"", "Author": "Laura A.

I'm sorry I didn't stick with what worked, and bought another Sony Mavica.Like the other reviews, I, too, learned to turn off the flash and yes, it did improve the photo quality, but nothing compared to the Sony.", "Date": "August 12, 2006"}, {"Title": "Great pics every time", "Author": "GMTeacher \"LS is best\"", "ReviewID": "R1LBNE06OZO4SA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great!  I have had mine for over a year.  It does use the AA batteries, but with a rechargeable battery setup you have it made. Some people complained that indoors they could not get clear pictures if shooting from a distance.  They said they were dark.  I had the same problem and then realized if you turn the flash off in a well lit room you will get sharp images.  Other digital cameras work the same way so if you're shooting at a wedding and are in a semi well lit setting.  Try turning off the flash.  You will be pleasantly surprised.", "Date": "August 8, 2006"}, {"Title": "What Flash Card is Right for This 4MP Camera?", "Author": "Brent D. Payne \"SEO Director, Tribune\"", "ReviewID": "R13N0ZU84DGCKI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is a question that all digital camera enthusiasts ask themselves shortly after purchasing a digital camera, but it is one that is not easily answered as there are many factors that need to be taken into consideration.  This review will help to guide you to the best solution based off the characteristics and specifications of the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera.  I feel I am qualified to provide this information as I was in the memory industry for 7 years but having left the industry a year ago, I can be completely unbiased on this subject.One of the biggest factors to consider is the megapixel rating of this Samsung camera.  Considering this particular camera is generally considered to be a 4MP digital camera.  You can expect to store approximately 32 images on a 64MB card, 64 pictures on a 128MB flash card, 128 digital pictures on digital film of 256MB capacity, 256 pics on a 512MB picture card, 512 images on a 1GB media card, 1,024 photos on a 2GB flash card, and a monstrous 2,048 digital photos on a 4GB card.  These image/picture calculations assume that you are going to utilize the full potential of your camera but won't shoot in RAW mode.  In other words, the estimates are for shooting at the highest JPEG setting available for the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera.  Understand that they are indeed estimates and can vary based off the actual scene or subject being shot and the amount of light, color variation, detail, etc. in the photo.  You can assume these numbers are accurate within 10%.However how many images a card can hold is not the only factor you should consider before buying this all important accessory.  You should also consider that you may want to use your Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera to take shots of sporting events, wildlife, or even your child's unique expressions.  These moments have a very small window of opportunity to get the shot you desire thus a flash card that has been rated by experts as being a faster card may be something to consider.  In my opinion, it is always best to find a review of a flash card as it performed in your specific digital camera.  Some cameras just work better with specific flash cards do to the software, firmware, buffer utilization, etc. between the camera and the flash card.  Finding an answer to this question is not usually an easy task.  There is, though, a superb website that not only offers flash card reviews but also has an extensive user forum that can answer this all important question for you.  You may want to take a look at dpreview dot com and then do a search for the Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera in the forums area, if that doesn't work just do a search on Samsung and you should be able to find someone that can help you.  I am fairly certain you will have plenty of information to make an informed buying decision.  You may also want to look at their detailed review of this particular camera as well if you have not yet decide on whether to purchase it.Of course one of the next factors to consider is in regards to price.  Please, do not make the mistake that I have made of buying the absolute cheapest flash card.  Take a look at the factors I have mentioned here before you make a purchase.  Think of a flash card for your Samsung camera as an extension to it.  Just as you wouldn't purchase the cheapest camera case for your camera (personally I own the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack but I like the extra room and the backpack style, which may not be your cup of tea) don't necessarily purchase the cheapest flash card either.  Keep in mind that you will use this card every single time you use your camera.  Like I said it is truly an extension of your digital camera.The final thing I will mention is in regards to service.  There are a number of flash card suppliers in the world today.  However all of the flash cards are actually built by a handful (3 - 5) of companies and even those companies only have a few options (2 - 4) regarding which components they are going to use in their particular design.  More or less, the actually hardware inside each flash card is going to be similar but the way in which they utilize that hardware and the level of support they will provide, given there is a problem, are more paramount.  Just imagine going 10 days without a flash card for your camera (which I did) because you are waiting for some company to repair your flash card, or worse yet having it fail and having no recourse.  There are a couple of manufacturers that do very well in regards to utilizing technology and providing customer service.  As of the time of this writing they are SanDisk, Lexar, and Viking.  However check the newsgroups and forums for the latest information as it can be very cyclical and unfortunately can take a turn for the worse overnight.No matter what flash card you decide to use with your digital camera make sure you take the time to take the pictures.  Time flies by fast and having thousands of images to thumb through 5 years from now to remind you of the time that has gone by will be the most powerful investment of all.  I have personally purchased a SimpleTech external hard drive to store my images on (another reason I like the Targus DPMV02 Pro Series Video/Photo Backpack as it gives me room to put in my hard drive).  The hard drive combined with the backpack allows me to take my photos with me when I go visit family and friends.  I use PhotoShop exclusively to do all my photo editing and batch processing (a great feature of PhotoShop) and of course make occasional backups to DVD-RW.Enjoy your Samsung Digimax 420 4MP Digital Camera.  I hope this review has informed you how this camera can be best enhanced by a flash card and the best approach in finding one that meets your specific needs.", "Date": "November 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "Quality", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R35M3HEVIQFNFM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife bought this for me as a present.
