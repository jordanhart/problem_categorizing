{"Reviews": [{"Title": "horrible horrible HORRIBLE camera", "Author": "K. Gent", "ReviewID": "R2TY6J44G58AS1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because I had lost mine, I don't have a lot of money, and I wanted something to take quick pictures at the end of my freshman year of college. I didn't care what quality the pictures looked like, I didn't care how many features it had, I just wanted something to take pictures with for cheap.But the problems with this camera were a MAJOR inconvenience when I wanted to use it.This camera had the following things wrong with it:1. Poor battery life2. Would turn off randomly3. Would show NO power left in NEW batteries4. Took horribly discolored/blurry pictures5. Took FOREVER to actually snap picture6. Red eye and other settings didn't even CHANGE the quality of picture8. VERY fragile and would turn off or not take pictures if you move AT ALL9. Would not remember settings and everything reset after it was turned offI know that there were FAR more things wrong with it that I can't even recall.I returned it to WalMart and used my return towards a camera and paid an extra $15 for a FARRR nicer inexpensive camera.Seriously. NOT RECOMMENDED. Not even for a low-budget use like myself.", "Date": "June 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Sanyo VPC-S1085", "Author": "Jamie Mccleese \"Ja\"", "ReviewID": "RUR2MIUS868UL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I love this canera but the video is kinda unsteady I think Pictures are great pretty good for the price. If you see a bad review they might have got a defective one cause my Kodak took bad pics and didn't even take clear pics and broke in less then a yr and know other who had the same and had the same problems with that one. I feel this one is way better. I just wish the video was better but for the price you get what you pay. For someone who is mostly gonna take pics this is an awesome Camera! Me being a avid youtube video star I am gonna have to buy a better camera for video!", "Date": "April 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Decent", "Author": "A. Gilbert", "ReviewID": "R2GF4T8DJL6EUO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is a pretty nice find, but I wouldn't pay more than $30 for it.  But, I'm a cheap-o.  I bought this to take quick cheap pictures, as other reviewers have stated.  The pictures turn out nice, there are a lot of functions, and the button layout is pretty simple to figure out.  In fact, my mother went out and bought a more expensive camera and couldn't figure out how to use it.  But, she picked mine up and started using it, with ease.  It doesn't feel cheap, it has a nice pink color to it.  My only complain on this camera, is the quality and availability of the battery door.  Mine is currently broken and to find a replacement so I can use the camera, is pretty obsolete.  But, the battery door issue is the ONLY complaint I have of this camera, and is the only reason I'm going to find another camera =[.  So, if you're in the market for a cheap, decent camera, and you would take better care of yours than I did (i dropped it several times!), you'd probably find this a great camera.", "Date": "May 7, 2012"}, {"Title": "i dont like it", "Author": "Lasha", "ReviewID": "R3AMII0CA5P9U9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "i dont like it (Sanyo VPC-S1085 10MP 3x 2.7\" LCD SD/SDHC Digital Camera Pink VPC-S1085-PNK  ut the problems with this camera were a MAJOR inconvenience when I wanted to use it.", "Date": "November 3, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "10 Megapixel, Compact Camera, 2.7 in.
