{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Decent quality photos and videos", "Author": "Mark Druziak", "ReviewID": "R39LOG2DZ18ZEE", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I do a lot of photography with my dSLR but I like to have a flexible point and shoot with me when I don't have the dSLR.  I also have been interested in shooting videos lately and have tried a Aiptek Go-HD and a Sanyo HD700.I like the form factor of the Z1285.  It handles better than my Kodak V550 and it really isn't much bigger.  Yes it is a little thicker.  The z1285 has a lot of pre-set modes and a full manual mode that works quite well.  It is easy to change shutter speed, f-stop, ISO and focus mode.  You can do it all from one screen using the controller button on the back.  No need to read the manual.Image quality is great for a point and shoot. There is a lot of noise at 1600 ISO however it cleans up quite well by using a noise reduction program like Noiseware.  The image quality is better than my V550 and significantly better than the HD700.The videos are surprisingly good.  Video quality is much better than the Aiptek Go-HD and sharper than my Sanyo HD700.  Indoor videos taken with the Z1285 have less noise than the HD700.  I did my comparisons in full auto mode and I think I could fine tune the HD700 a little, but I don't think the video would be as sharp as with the Z1285.  Video stabilization is better on the HD700.  The audio quality on the HD700 is significantly better than Z1285.  But the audio quality on the Z1285 is significantly better than the Aiptek Go-HD.Overall it is a very good package at a decent price.  I think it is a better value than the HD700.  If the audio quality were up to the HD700 standards, it would be a slam dunk and I would sell the HD700.4 stars only because of audio performance.  Other than that it is great!", "Date": "March 11, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome HD Movie but Worst Macro mode shooting!", "Author": "Teetee", "ReviewID": "R3T238BSNG2I9C", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This camera replaced my old F10 Fuji Finepix.  I had several cameras (Fuji/Canon/Olympus) but this is the first time I'm trying out Kodak (cheapest HD camera I've found that allow zoom during movie recording mode)I took two stars away from it for two reasons:1. Macro shooting mode is horrible.  It won't shoot at close range at all comparing to other cameras I have had.  I was able to shoot a nice close up at 1 inch range with Fuji and Olympus but this Kodak Easyshare will not focus and get blurry as soon as the lense is in the 6 inch range from object.  I returned and exchange my Easyshare once because I thought the first one was broken.  I was surprised to learn that this camera will not do a close up shot.2. Movie recording length is limit to 29 minutes when shooting in HD.  I read on Kodak website and it says \"80 minutes\" and I misunderstood.  80 minutes max ... at lowest resolution - that is :(There are many good things about this camera.  It uses SD card.  It records very nice HD quality video (picture/sound).  It can zoom in recording mode (Fuji does not). It takes good pictures (12MP).  Battery life is pretty good.  Forget Sony Handycam, get this Z1285 instead and have a blast with HD video recording!", "Date": "March 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "EasyShare= Easy Decision", "Author": "J. Park", "ReviewID": "R14S02GOC3S7XD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Kodak EasyShare Z1285 is more than just a camera. It's a camcorder, sound recorder, slideshow creator, image cropper, and of course a camera with myriad functions.Pros:-12.1 Megapixels means maximum 3000 by 4000 pixel images-Adjustable image resolution settings-Amazing video quality with adjustable resolution settings-Extremely easy to use-Really low price for product-Many, many adjustable settings and shoot modes-Large, vibrant screen-Expandable SD & SDHC card slot-USB connection (with cable included)-and perhaps my favorite part--the fact that it uses 2 AA batteriesCons:-When adjusting zoom, the picture becomes temporarily unfocused-Poor image stabilization for free hand 1280 by 720 video shooting-When filming videos to my Transcend 8GB SDHC card, you can hear the camera writing to the card faintly. It sounds similar to a helicopter in the distance. The sound is only noticeable when no noises are present in the video. I think it may have something to do with the High Capacity SD cards because I didn't notice the noise with my Sandisk 1GB SD card.I paired my camera up with a Transcend 8GB SDHC and some Energizer NH15BP-4 ACCU 2500mAh Rechargeable AA Batteries to make it literally the best camera around. I can have over 2100 pictures at the highest resolution on it or hours of High Definition videos. The 1280 by 720 pixel videos have a maximum of 29 minutes for one continuous video. However, the 8GB card will hold hours of collective feeds. My high-drain batteries allow me to take many pictures and lots of videos without having to change or charge the batteries. Plus, when I do have to change them, I just switch the dead batteries with freshly charged ones and I'm good to go--unlike most others, I don't have to wait for the camera to charge.Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase of the Kodak Z1285 EasyShare Camera and would recommend it to anyone. (We have already purchased another for my mother and my sister wants one now too.) The price is well worth the value--I paid $185 for mine and would be willing to pay $300 plus. Don't let the three cons discourage you, the benefits of purchasing this camera far transcend the drawbacks.", "Date": "June 3, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money", "Author": "Andrew Ludewig \"itchykawa\"", "ReviewID": "R1NSVXRH3IVQBD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I wasn't very big with the kodak brand digital cameras, but they have come a long way now.  This camera packs 12MP worth of resolution, prints up to a whopping 30 x 40 print.  Most people will never print that big, but that means your smaller prints will come out even clearer.  One thing I love is that it works on my iMac with iLife 08.  It's Vista compatible.  It shoots native 720P HD video.  Basically, you need a very large SDHC card.  I have an 8GB Transcend card that I bought off of New Egg.  On that 8GB card I can shoot 2172 12MP photos, or 2 hours of HD video.  This camera only shoots in 29min segments, so make sure you don't need to continuously shoot for over 29mins long.  To give you an idea of file size for video, it's 1MB per sec.  For pictures, it's 2MB per image.  Over all, i love this camera, I'm taking it to Europe this June, it is compact and easy to use.", "Date": "February 13, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera For the Price", "Author": "Tech Nut \"Tech Nut\"", "ReviewID": "R1JLUGPWTTL7VR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought the Kodak Z1285 about 3 weeks ago on Amazon for $149.95 and I was initially skeptical about so many features for such a low price.  After shooting about 100 pictures and about 20 minutes of video, I feel that my purchase was a good one.  Here's the pro's and con's why...First, the highlights:The 5x optical zoom is wonderful.  I have had 3 digital cameras before this and the best of those had only a 3x zoom.  So, 5x zoom really gets you up close.  This is a real plus when you are taking pictures from, let's say, the back of a school auditorium.Panoramic shooting mode is awesome.  I have only played around with this so far, but it would be nice in outdoor shots of nature.There is no shutter lag that I could detect.The camera is compact enough to fit into most pockets.  It is not the most compact camera out there, but it is reasonably small.The 12 megapixel pictures are very impressive, sharp and the colors are true to life.The video, whether at 640 x 480, or HD widescreen, is very good for a point and shoot camera.  You can also zoom while taking a video (but see my drawback section). I use Pinnacle and Magix to create DVDs and have no problem creating DVDs with the quicktime (.MOV) files this camera creates. I would not throw away my camcorder just yet, but I guess the day is coming...There are plenty of shooting modes, but the camera can be left on automatic which makes it a simple point and shoot process.It takes AA batteries and, with the rechargeables that I use, the life of the batteries is not bad.  I know what the other reviews said, but, compared with all of the other digital cameras I have had, this one has the best battery life by far and they are AA!There is only about 2-3 second delay between photos when not using the flash.  That's a decent turn around time.  There is a \"burst\" setting if this is a problem for some.The image stabilization mode is helpful.Now, the drawbacks:The camera body is all plastic.  This is really not a problem, but it does lessen the \"feel factor\" that you are holding a quality product or showing it off to a friend.The compression of the JPEG files by this camera cuts the picture down to anywhere from 1.4 to 2.0 megs per shot.  This is not necessarily a problem, but it is not adjustable as some other manufacturers make this a user setting.In a side by side comparison of a friend's Canon SD 1100 IS camera, I would have to say that picture quality is roughly the same.  I had a difficult time telling the difference between the pictures taken by these two cameras.  Keep in mind that the SD 1100 is only a 8mp camera.  However, keep in mind that my friend also paid $70 more for his camera.  So I am not sure if this one is a \"pro\" or a \"con\".There is \"noise\" in the photos when shooting in the image stabilization mode.  This appears to be due to the camera stepping up to a higher ISO.The camera picks up a sound from the data writing to the flash card during the recording of HD video.  The sound is not noticeable if, let's say, the video you are recording has a lot of sound already.  However, during quiet passages, the camera picks up soft \"clicks\" that end up on your video.  It's not terrible, but just be aware.The camera picks up the sound of the zoom motor if you zoom while recording a video.  I guess that's why most every other manufacturer out there does not allow you to zoom while taking a video.The flash could be stronger.  It's not bad; I just wish it could go beyond the 12 foot range since the optical zoom gets you out so far.Summary:All things considered, this camera packs a lot of features and quality for the price.  The good points far outweigh any drawbacks this camera may have.  No, it is not a Canon, or a Sony so your family and friends might not be impressed by the label.  However, if you do not want to spend $200+ on a camera with all of these features and you want something easy to use that takes good quality pictures and video, then you will not go wrong selecting this camera.  If you can get it at $149.95 like I did, then it is a real bargain.", "Date": "June 29, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome Pictures  -  BAD Video", "Author": "M. Binetti \"mb\"", "ReviewID": "R1X53LJW2MEKAD", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera because it is one of the few available that do HD video, and it's the cheapest also. I was pleasantly surprised how good the pictures taken with this camera are. It is fully adjustable from resolutions of about 1.3MP all the way to 12MP, in 4:3 and 16:9 ratios. I took it with me on a trip to Puerto Rico and all the photos were awesome. Beach Mode is particularly good, and this camera does full three-stage panoramic shots for awesome landscapes.My only problem with this camera (which is big) was HD video. Now, the camera records in 720p (1280x720). Now of course with any recording there are two aspects: video and audio. Video in HD is GORGEOUS. Colors are great, it has zoom, it can be a bit jumpy with motion but what do you expect. My problem is the audio. The audio to begin with is sort of dull and tinny. It records fine to internal memory, but that's only 32mb or so. You can of course record to SDHC/SD, but that it where the problem arises. When recording to memory card, the sound of the data moving to the card transfers to the videos!  It's not too noticeable when recording a high volume scene, but when I tried, for example, to record my sister's baby trying to talk in a quiet room, the noise from the card completely drowned out the baby. Yes, it is THAT LOUD!I tried two different cameras, one from Walmart one from Newegg thinking it might be that, same problem. I also tried three different SDHC cards (A-DATA, Transcend, and Sandisk Extreme III, as well as a 150x SD card. All had the same result...horrible noise in the audio feed from the camera. As I said, it doesn't happen when recording to internal memory, so the issue is clearly with the card tranfers. I called Kodak, they said it was normal...NORMAL! But then they tried to have me send it in for service, which shows they don't know what they are talking about.So anyway, great cam for pics, their HD technology isn't there yet as the HD audio is HORRIBLE!", "Date": "April 12, 2008"}, {"Title": "Another dissatisified customer", "Author": "M. narkiewicz \"Mary\"", "ReviewID": "RRBV8BGL9G9E9", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I was excited when I purchased this camera.. 12 megapixels, optical zoom! I bought it in September 2007.  And it was treated so very well..no dropping, no nothing, hardly used it..In September 2008, it started to freeze and die. Fresh batteries didn't help. Sometimes it turned on, sometimes not. Now it is permanently opened..the lens extended..and it will not turn on.I had to buy a new camera in October (Nikon- I didn't make the same mistake twice) so I could take photos on my trip to see family.I wrote several detailed emails to Kodak. They just recommended new batteries and other nonhelpful thoughts.  Now I can't use the camera. Should I toss it, repair it?  They do not replace defective cameras and they will not pay for repair, though there was ostensibly a year warranty on the darn thing. I don't really know what a warranty is worth. Nothing, apparantly.My advice is- DO NOT BUY this camera..be wary of Kodak products.  No help will be forthcoming should you get a crappy product. Maybe all digital camera makers are like this...I don't know yet.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Love this camera", "Author": "farmersdaught82", "ReviewID": "RUFPW846BFB31", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I love this camera.  I have had it for a little over a month.  Prior to this I owned 2 HP cameras.  My last HP camera took wonderful pictures, but ate batteries.  When going anywhere-a wedding, the zoo for the day, etc I knew to pack at least 10 batteries, usually more like 12 and I'd use everyone of them, which I why I decided to buy a new camera.  Here are my thoughts:1. Batteries- this camera is great on the batteries.  I bought a pack of 4 Kodak AA reacharable, along with a charger.  So far, those batteries have served me and I've only had to recharge a few times.  I went to a shower where I took over 150 pictures and I NEVER had to change the batteries, and the batteries had already been in the camera for awhile.2. Picture Quality-is great.  I can easily get a clear 8 x 10 in any of the picutres.  I do a lot of flower designing for weddings and I take up close pictures of my bouquets a lot.  It took me a few times to play with the settings to find the right one, but it takes good pictures even with that, which leads me to my next point3. Flash- seems to be very good.  My flower colors are very true to real life, as is all of the colors in the pictures that I take.4. Features-this camera has great feaures.  It has a panoramic mode, which I love, although I haven't yet had a real reason to use it.  It also has a speical self-portriat setting, which my teenage god-daughter loves.  It has a fireworks option, which I can't wait to try tonight, and several other great options.  When I first got the camera, I took a picture of the exact same thing using each of the settings to see how it affected the picture.  If you arent sure of the settings, or are giving your camera to someone else to take pictures with, you can set it to the Smart Scene function and the camera will automatically use the best option.5. Memory-You need to get at least a 2GB or 4GB memory card.  The camera does have an \"internal\" memory, which I found took about 20-30 pictures depending on how many megapixels I had it set on  (I usually have it set on 9, so that it doesn't take as much memory).  I had a 128MB memory card from my old camera that allowed me to take just under 300 pix on that camera, but I could only take about 45 on this one.  Now that I have the 4GB card, I can take over 2,000 pictures.6. Software- I don't really like the software that came with it.  I find it hard to use, and it took a lot of memory from my system.  The HP software is much better than the Kodak software.  It put my pictures is some weird file that I had to search long for before I could find where they were to send out in an email, etc.  The software works with both the Vista Desktop I have, and my XP laptop.  I have found it easier to just use the memory card port on the desktop, rather than hooking up the camera with the included USB cord.  That being said, the software is great if you want to burn your pictures to a CD, since it's very easy.7. The only 2 things I dont LOVE about this camera is the fact that each time I remove the batteries & recharge them, I have to re-set the time & date.  This may be because it is without batteries at times for 24+ hours.  However, that is not enough to stop me from highly recommending this camera.  I also find the turn-around time between shots to be a little longer that I would like, but there may be a setting to help change with.  I'm still playing with the camera, and haven't played with EVERY feature yet.All in all, the camera is an excellent value and I don't regret buying it.", "Date": "July 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Kodak raises the bar with Z1285 - 12 MP + HD video camera", "Author": "Steve Bradford", "ReviewID": "R2VPJIU9K44BM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased my Kodak Z1285 12 Megapixel compact camera because I needed better resolution and my previous Kodak was a small 4 MP. Nothing wrong, it still works. I just needed something sharper. When I saw the Kodak Z1285, I jumped at it. I have never looked back. This camera is incredible in both sharpness and quality. Even the High Definition video is incredible.Like many Kodak digital cameras, the Z1285 shares the same simplicity and ease-of-use that has made Kodak digital cameras so popular. Kodak's use of Schneider-Kreuznach lenses are so sharp, I can count the stitches on clothing in my pictures. I was shocked how sharp pictures came from this little camera. My previous Kodak's had their standard Retinar lenses, yet experiencing the Schneider-Kreuznach lens clarity, I could never go back. Compared to Canon or Fuji lenses, the Kodak's Schneider-Kreuznach lenses are leaps-and-bounds better. The camera's construction is well thought-out. It's solid and well-built. Nothing clunky or cheap here.The Kodak Z1285 comes with a USB 2.0 transfer cable along with Kodak's EasyShare software. The user menu is similar to previous Kodak menus. So the learning cure is almost nil.  It has a small AC power port, along with a SD/MMC memory card port for added memory.  Its size is both small, yet easily handled. It's not super-slim not leafy in weight. It holds some weight to allow the user to hold and maneuver and shoot/video with some control (a problem with razor-thin digital cameras).The camera uses Smart Scene as default for scene selection. The Kodak Z1285 `reads' the image you're shooting and adjusts the camera to the best scene selection. The Scene setting allows you to select preset scene settings, such as Night time, Sunset, Portrait, Fireworks, Candle light, Beach, and many more. You can also select Program and Manual mode to configure or manually configure your own camera settings. This camera can also be used as a web cam.Besides the sharpness of the pictures, I was shocked by the clarity of the video. This small camera shoots HD video. You can zoom using the small toggle while shooting video, as well. The video is quite impressive, given the camera's small size.The one drawback with this camera is the battery life. Unless you're using Lithium batteries, expect to replace alkalines on a regular basis.I highly recommend this camera to both amateur and familiar photographers who would like a small yet powerful high-megapixel digital camera/video in their pocket or purse.

It was either this or a Canon Sureshot but I went with the Kodak because I'm familiar with Kodak's layout and general functionality.The Z1285 looks cheap but I was buying for function, not appearance, so I didn't let that stop me. After purchase, I began testing it out -- indoors, outdoors, in the dark, at the beach, close up. I used every setting - Smart Scene, ISO, Digital Image Stabilization, Scene Selector (which has about 19 different scene selections including backlight, snow, beach, candlelight, fireworks, etc.) Picture after picture, I was rewarded with washed out, grainy, artifact-filled, blurry, or extremely ghosted photos. I tried every setting in every situation but there was something wrong in every picture. I thought it might be the camera so I returned it and exchanged it for another of the same model. Same thing.Last night my sister and I brought our cameras (I had the Z1285 and she brought her point-and-shoot Olympus) out for a special event and we each took our own photos. When we uploaded the images to the computer, it was easy to see which camera took which pictures. My sister is admittedly bad at taking photos but her camera produced clear, bright pictures every time, even in dark and backlit situations. The Z1285 photos were practically useless.

His pictures, taken under all kinds of difficult conditions, turned out great.  Before buying this Kodak 1285 I searched the internet, stores, and websites looking for any camera that may have been a better deal but could not find any!  The combination of 5X Zoom (plus an additional 5X digital Zoom) was tops in it's class alone.  But when you add the unprecidented 12MP nothing else came close unless you went to a SLR size camera.  I already have a fantastic 35mm SLR camera but seldom have it with me because of the size.  This camera will fit in a pocket or in a small belt pouch and I have had it with me nearly all of the time since I've purchased it.  It also has the advantage of taking AA batteries rather than the rechargeable internal batteries.  I use rechargeable AAs and have been using the first pair for a month now without having to replace them.  And if I'm ever in a situation where my rechargeables are dead I can always use standard AA batteries which are available everywhere!  This camera is easy to use, with several \"smart\" modes but is still able to be set up manually.

I wanted this to complement my Z612 which is too big to put comfortably in my pocket- This is supposed to be my portable solution. I do a lot of amateur photography and have had a few photos used in publications.First, there's not many menu picks. The last two Kodak cameras had an ability to disable digital zoom, for example. There's just not many fine-tuning options in the menu.I took the same picture at 12MP and 9MP 16:9, and they were about the same. (I have an ultrasharp LCD, btw). Actually, I slightly prefer the 9MP shot.  There's no need to get into CCD and pixels and whatnot, but you might be better off with this lower setting. I can fit 2777 photos on an 8gig card.General photos: I took random shots inside and outside. Some while walking, driving, standing/sitting still, and even with the camera on a flat surface. Almost all of the photos are either grainy, blurry, or off-colored.  I also tried various scene options like Macro (flower), Text, Panaoramic, landscape, night portrait, etc..Funny, the panoramic shot is the clearest- even compared to the same subject as a standard picture.  It's neat- but it's definitely not flawless in matching up seams.When I zoomed in the max optical zoom (5x), most of the time I could not get a clear picture without putting the camera on a level surface. I'm a fairly steady handed person, too. Even general zoom there's a lot of blurriness. If I wanted photos like that, I would have borrowed my wife's panasonic lumix.The camera does very poorly in low light situations- far far worse than my z612. I was hoping the lower MP setting would help a bit, but no.Video: even worse then the z612 which is pretty bad to start with. The shot is jittery (not shaky and in handheld, but back-and-forth digitally jittery), there's also flashes of light that happen for no reason. The audio is poor, and just like the Z612, if you zoom in/out or the autofocus happens, you can hear it on the final video- it sounds like gears grinding.The only places this camera excels is well-lit portraits and landscapes. I would not use it for video, macro, action, or low light situations. This will probably be my last Kodak.I'd return it, but I want it for an upcoming trip. Plus it's a secondary camera meant to be easy to tote around.  I would not recommend this for anyone's primary camera.", "Date": "January 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "We love the Kodak Z1285", "Author": "M. VanVooren \"Mike\"", "ReviewID": "R7XL6YDZYIE7V", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We purchased a Kodak Z1275 in August, 2007 and were instantly amazed.  When we accidentally broke the screen, we immediately sent it in for repairs, and bought a Z1285 to cover in its absence (in July, 2008).  We have taken ~4,400 pictures on the Z1275 and 500+ on the Z1285.The Z1275 and Z1285 are largely the same.  The only change I have seen (beyond body color) is that the 1275 has a much quieter motor, which greatly helps when taking movies.The image quality, coupled with the small size (but not too small, like so many unusable `tiny' cameras), is what has one of them in my pocket virtually all weekend, and in my briefcase while on business travel during the week, and one at home for the family to use.While on a trip to Southern California last April, I took similar photos with the Z1275 and with professional Kodak Portra film, and I was stunned at how much better the Z1275 images came out - the colors were brighter and more vibrant, and the details amazing.  We could also see some incredibly small details on the bugs on the flowers, and those pictures were from a foot or two away.The short list of the best features are:- Ease of use... Kodak really thought through the buttons and the menus to make it all quite easy to quickly jump through- The strength of the video quality - I do recommend a tripod for less shaking from natural body movements- Action prints makes pictures of the videos.- The P/M setting lets me get amazing night photos, including shots of stars; while I prefer ISO 64 wherever possible, some of the darkest settings come better in the still-sharp 400 and 800 speed settings.- Great close-up pictures of the flowers (if only I could get the wind to stop blowing better)- Panoramic images (stitched in-camera) that capture scenes so well (I hope they upgrade to full 12-megapixels for these; they currently step-down to 4mp)- Perfect Touch technology is simply amazing, taking good pictures and making them truly great!- Out kids love taking pictures and quickly learned how to use it themselvesFor batteries, I recommend Energizer 2500 mAh NiMH AA rechargeables and their compact charger.Kodak continues to be the premier photographic/imaging company in the world.", "Date": "October 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Kodak Easy share Z1285 12.1 MP Digital Camera", "Author": "Peter L.

I have had the Kodak Z1285 camera for about 6 months now.  This camera has angered me so much, that I finally had to sit down and warn others of its absolutely terrible performance.Sure, it looks like a great deal: 12 megapixels, 5x optical zoom, HD video, etc.  However, the performance is UNACCEPTABLE.  The first thing is a constant blue screen of death.  After literally each picture, when you are ready to snap the second precious pic of any loved one or special moment, this camera blanks out to a \"blue screen of death\" with the word \"Processing\" displayed.  This blue screen lasts anywhere from 3 seconds to 30 seconds and disables your ability to snap a picture.  Bye Bye precious moment.  This one feature alone makes this camera unsatisfactory for anyone's use.  It is a definite deal killer.I called Kodak about this and wrote emails.  They do not seem to be aware of this problem and gave me the standard \"we apologize for blah blah blah.\"  They suggested that either the batteries needed replacement or the memory card was defective.  Neither was the problem.  I use lithium AA batteries (great batteries by the way - forget alkalines for your camera.)  I also used different memory cards all from the most reputable supplier \"SanDisk.\"  The Blue Screen of Processing Death is in the camera.  You will be EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED due to this design defect.  Kodak did not offer to refund my money.The next deal killer is the video.  Forget taking HD video with this camera.  My Razr cell phone takes better video - literally.  The video on this camera is CHOPPY, STAGGERS, MISSES ACTION, and is TOTALLY UNWATCHABLE.  You could take successive photos, place them in a stack and flip through them quickly and get better animation movement.  The video at ANY setting (of quality resolution) is UNACCEPTABLE.  It's like the camera has to stop taping and REFOCUS every 1/2 second to 2 seconds.  Much action is truly missed and the movie is more like flipping pages through a story book and \"skipping through time.\"The next deal killer is the optical zoom.  The camera zooms but it is too shaky to take a picture with.  And for some reason all the pictures taken at high zoom are GRAINY.  Color rendition is also EXTREMELY POOR.  In essence, the zoom is USELESS.In addition, the \"Image Stabilization\" option is a knob setting and not a selection that can be used for every mode of picture taking.  So if you want to use a night shot or the \"Beach\" or \"Firecracker\" or \"Museum\" or ANY mode setting, you CANNOT USE the image stabilization at the same time since it is not setting.  In fact, when you select the Image Stabilization, there is no way to tell what mode the camera is in or how it is adjusting the speed or ISO settings.  The \"Image Stabilization\" setting is thus USELESS.  When on high zoom, you definitely need image stabilization because the camera is so shaky and sensitive to movement your photo will be BLURRY and SMEARED and UNACCEPTABLE.  So if you wanted to, for example, take a night time shot of a city scene with all the city lights, from far away, and you zoom up on it, you CANNOT engage the stabilization feature and your picture will, without FAIL, come out BLURRED.I should note that the camera has a good feel to it and does not feel like a cheap plastic camera.  That is its one nice feature.  However, it cannot take a decent picture even when all lighting and subject conditions are optimal.  Note also that there is no viewfinder so you must always use the LCD screen (a battery life waster).In conclusion, this camera is SLOW, POORLY DESIGNED, and takes LOUSY, POOR-COLOR RENDITION pictures.  The video is COMPLETELY UNUSABLE.  I had owned a Kodak 3 megapixel camera for several years before I got this one.  The old Kodak camera took wonderful pictures.  This Z1285 model however, has set digital photography back many years.  All in all, buy AT YOUR OWN RISK.  I wish I had taken this camera back when I first got it.

Well once again, you get what you pay for... the video on this thing is a jokeHere are my 3 main complaints:1) The Continuous auto-focus is waaaaay to sensitive - it zooms in and out about twice every second, even for minor movements with no change in field depth. The end result is a video that is unwatchable as you will quickly develop a headache as the picture constantly goes in and out of focus. Turning off Continuous Auto-Focus eliminates this issue, but with no way to manually adjust focus depth (without zooming in and out) it makes it extremely difficult to shoot moving objects.2) Even when mounted to a tripod, the video is extremely shaky if you're trying to film a moving object, thanks to some motion tracking \"feature\" that as best I can tell CANNOT BE TURNED OFF!! The end result is that you cannot keep a static frame of reference, as the screen will jump around in an effort to keep the subject centered, but it does such a terrible job it looks like you're filming during an earthquake.3) While technically HD due to its ability to capture 1280 x 720, the video is hardly \"HD Quality\" as the box claims. Even in broad daylight there is quite a bit of image noise, and the playback was very choppy like it was dropping frames. In lower lighting it looks like your shooting in a technicolor snowstorm!!as for taking pictures, well I have to say the quality is equal or less than my previous 6MP Polaroid, and more often than not the auto focus freaks out at the very last moment and my pictures wind up blurry (where they were crisp on screen when I pressed the button). It also has a significant lag time between pressing the button, and actually taking the picture, which is followed by 10-30 second \"processing\" screen, so taking a series of pictures in rapid progression is completely out of the question.Bottom line: This camera sucks. The \"HD Video\" is pretty much a marketing gimmick and you will be very disappointed with the quality. I've been using this camera for about 2 months now, and I've pretty much given up hope - now I'm kicking myself for not returning it when I had the chance.

So, initially I enjoyed the camera. It was easy to use, but the Kodak Easyshare software can be a pain sometimes because there would be times when the camera and the software will start uploading the photos, and sometimes it'll take several tries before it starts working. Also, the battery life is terrible. I think there around 15 or 20 photos the battery loses its charge, but that's a very rough estimate. Either way, I have to constantly shut off the camera after taking a photo out of fear that it will die to quickly.What stinks about this camera is that it can take really nice outdoor photos, but sometimes indoor photos look grainy or blurry, and objects moving even the slightest motion can blur the entire photo, so you either have to have a really steady hand, or hope that you can take a good photo while the object is moving.Video recording is actually really good, but due to battery life you have to be cautious as to how much you wanna record.Overall, it's a decent camera, but its not the price amazon is selling it for.

I finally chose this camera because of its price, size (I have large hands and I struggle with smaller cameras), pixel size, and its lens. While I had it, I took about 10,000 pictures and videos with. Some of those pictures held their own when I submitted them for photography competitions against professionals and dslr camera users.The design of the camera itself allowed users to manipulate the camera with one hand. By doing so, it made quick flipping through various camera settings relatively easy. The camera has a panoramic setting that, at the time, was ahead of its time. The camera also had a manual setting which was extremely useful for specialty shots that the presets could not capture properly. The 5x optical lens and the 12mp allowed for larger pictures to be taken from greater distances.This camera did have some problems. Without buying special rechargeable batteries, the camera would drain regular Duracell and Energizer batteries in about 10 shots. One preset setting for motion blur reduction would create a lot of noise in the picture. Without a tripod, video recording would have a continuous shake to it. When taking pictures in rapid succession, the camera would stop you from taking more pictures until it was done processing the first set of pictures. Macro photos needed to be taken no closer than 6-10 inches or else the camera wouldn't focus.Despite its setbacks, I still love my Z1285. But I would never recommend anyone to buy it now for two reasons. The camera's specs are equivalent to a top of the line camera in 2008. There are other cameras that vastly out perform the Z1285. Also, there was manufacturing change which drastically ruined the quality of the camera. Shortly after I bought mine, a friend's family bought four for themselves. Each one of those cameras died within a year after purchase.I decided to finally call my z1285 dead just now after noticing the image sensor takes 5 minutes to \"warm up\" before it can take a picture without putting lines and grey spots in it.", "Date": "March 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "I was just like you, checking Amazon reviews.", "Author": "KJFP", "ReviewID": "R38RIGIQFGVVNK", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "So after checking the reviews on Amazon I was thinking, oh most people who bought the camera thought it was decent, and for only 80 bucks it would be worth it, but boy was I wrong! When I opened the box took it out, put the batteries in and started taking pictures it was amazing, but after a few weeks... maybe even months I began to come to the realization, this camera is bad. Now when it comes to cameras I used to not know much, my very first camera being a Easyshare z710, I liked the simple camera, easy to take good pictures but I have shaky hands, and this always needed a tripod and regardless the photos were always low quality because it was only 7.1megapixels. In about a year or so though I have seen other peoples cameras, their nice DSLRs and their simple phone cameras, so I decided to get a better camera that was also more portable, while trying not to spend anymore than I did for the z710, I found it, and checked the reviews on Amazon and it looked decent enough so I bought it. I now have had it for about 2 years now and man I wish i returned it while i could have. So enough of my stories I'll explain WHY.Lets start with the Pros: - The camera has a nice HD video setting, The quality of it is very nice, the stabilization is nice and the videos are top notch - The stabilization of the camera makes it a nice point and shoot cameraNow the all too many Cons (with in-depth explanations):- The camera eats batteries quicker than any other item I have ever owned  A. The camera takes about 10 minutes of HD video before a brand news Duracell battery has to be replaced, 15minutes if it's ultra, dont think about getting those special camera batteries, they can't stop this monster from eating  B. The camera on average for me at least takes about 100 pictures at most, if you are lucky, before the batteries must be replaced, and don't you think about using that flash!  C. Put brand new batteries in thinking I'd use it soon, but never did and in 2 weeks the batteries were dead, so in otherwords, this camera eats batteries in it's sleep!!!- Cool flower? Cool bug? Anything that is smaller than a foot in size that looks cool you just can't take a picture of!  A. It is just impossible, it will come out fuzzy, blurry, you won't be able to know what you took a picture of when reviewing, and no tripods don't help it's the camera  B. Now it is decent at taking photos of maybe your family from a distance, but the photos are very fuzzy, don't zoom in and they'll look ok  C. I guess I would suggest this for people who are selling items on craiglist, ebay, ect. and need photos of that item-OH LOADING SCREEN ON A CAMERA?  A. Was going for a walk, and hey I saw the coolest thing! What was it? I'd like to show you but the camera decided to go into a processing mode for 3 minutes from the previous picture I took, I turned it off and back on... and it was too late!  B. After about every 3rd video I took it would freeze on the processing screen, so I'd start turning it off after every video I took or after a set of pictures, but it didn't matter too much since the battery would usually die by then anyways-Need to mention this again, IT CONSUMES BATTERIES FASTER THAN A HUMMINGBIRD FLAPS ITS WINGS, I've honestly spent over $100 on batteries because of this camera, and i've probably had it on less than a total of 24 hours-Takes an impossible amount of time to load when trying to take a zoomed images  A. Zoomed in on something, which is just a bad idea for this camera, it says it has 10x optical zoom but I suggest never using it, the camera will continue again and again to try to stabilize and even on a tripod it's almost impossible to get an image that isn't blurry  B. I would like to just say the best quality you can get is any pictures under 3x zoom, those will be deecent as long as you are far enough away  C. So overall if you are taking pictures of like landscape, large items, people or architecture, then it is a pretty good camera with pretty good photosSo the highest pricetag I would put on this camera is about 40 bucks, it takes amazing videos, honest, and the pics are quite good if you are 5 feet away from something and don't need to zoom in on it. Yet it is a pretty thick camera hard to fit in a pants pocket, so it being point and shoot for if your family goes to maybe somewhere like disney land is not ideal. If buying it to take on a vacation or somthing, be sure to bring a small case with a neck strap so you can carry it around, then also bring a breifcase full of batteries. I recycle batteries and recycled 10 pounds of them, no lie, so if you want this camera make sure you pay no more than $40 because you will need that money you 'save' to buy batteries.So my final summary is that this is like a fat cat, you bring it on vacation with you and need to bring lots of food, and this cat likes expensive food, like lasagna. You want to bring it around but it isn't somthing you can just carry around and when you want to play with it... Well how can I compare this to it's processing, well maybe it is 'letting the dogs out', no cat's don't let dogs out... Ah! It's taking a break, and you need to wake it up to play with it again but sometimes it falls asleep when you play with it and man you just hate this cat... If you understand what I'm talking about at this point, then congratulations you just saved yourself from wasting money on this camera.", "Date": "January 10, 2012"}, {"Title": "The  camera is ok, but a  rip-off on battery, it practically takes only  lithium battery", "Author": "Smith Towne", "ReviewID": "R2NUGWZXE1469B", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This Kodak Easyshare z1285 camera takes reasonable good pictures under daylight condition, but not so good indoors. That is what I give it one star for.  But the worst is that it practically takes only the expensive 3V lithium bateries (CR-V3, or AA), although it appears that two regular AA alkaline batteries, or two AA Ni_MH rechargeable battery would do, but those don't work on this camera, and here is why;1. The regular 1.5V AA alkaline batteries last very short on this camera. The camera shuts itself off as soon as the battery voltage drops a little bit below 1.5V, somewhere around 1.46V, even though the batteries may still have a quite bit of juice in them.2. This camera does not take the regular AA Ni-HM rechargeable batteries either, as the voltage of these rechargeable battery is 1.2V, two of them make only 2.4V, not 3V this camera wants.  I think Kodak could have designed this camera to run on 2.4V like other brands (such as Canon) , but they did not.  I don't know if it was just a bad design, or kodak intentionally did so to sell their CR-V3 lithium batteries.3. Kodak also makes CR-V3 Li-ion rechargeable battery, but it is 3.7V, not 3V. I don't know what would happen if it is used on this camera.  I certainly don't want to find out.4. and there are some off-brand, import 3V CR-3V li-ion rechargeable batteries out there, but I don't know how well they work.If anyone is considering this camera, he/she should be aware of this battery restriction - which sucks !", "Date": "December 30, 2011"}, {"Title": "Explore other options before spending the $200+", "Author": "Brian Novotney", "ReviewID": "R2UNITBM9W2YOI", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I've had this camera for over a year and i wish i would have bought something else...the drawbacks are HORRIBLE battery life and HORRIBLE close ups...outside it seems fine but inside in darker conditions it struggles to keep the picture clear.  most pics are blurry, even if you manually choose the settings...same with close ups, blurry and the camera searches and searches for an object to lock onto..again even in manual things turn out not so great...hope this helps.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "poor choice", "Author": "s", "ReviewID": "RI568EMC6JG6M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It took great pictures when it worked properly.

Within about a month, when I tried to use the zoom lens, it would begin to zoom in, but then the camera would shut off. A few weeks later, the \"eye lids\" that are supposed to protect the lens broke, The bottom one dropped into the open position, even when the camera was off, and then the upper lid would droop down and partially cover the lens when taking pictures.The biggest issue I have with the camera is that it is power hungry. At first, I thought it was draining the batteries and I'd have to take lots of extras with me to keep it operational. But then I bought a battery tester and started checking the \"depleted\" batteries, and they tested in the high range. I'd guess that they were only 10% drained when the camera would stop working. I found that I could take the \"dead\" batteries and put them into my Sanyo camera, and I could easily shoot another hundred pictures with them.Finally, the camera just died. The lights turn on and the lens tries to open, but the viewing screen doesn't light up at all. And it's not worth the cost of the repairs.

I purchased this camera in November.  It worked great over Christmas, but in march it stopped working.  It would turn on briefly then shut down immediately.  I sent the camera to the authorized repair place and they sent me a new camera.  The new camera had the same exact problem.  It worked for about 200 pictures then quit.  I returned it to the repair place.  They repaired the camera and sent it back.  Quess what!  It powered up just long enough to put in the date and time, then shut down.  I put in new batteries, it powered up and then immediately shut down.  So, I called Kodak.  Apparently, they are such a large company that they just don't care that their products are faulty.  I was told to try buying rechargable batteries (which is an investment that I would not consider since I use the camera maybe once every three months) because the Duracell and Energizer batteries are not strong enough to power the camera.  Strange that they worked before.  I asked if I could just get my money back so that I could purchase another camera.  NO!  Kodak does not offer refunds.  In short, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, TIME, AND EFFORT ON THIS CAMERA.  I wish I had checked the reviews online prior to my purchase, it may have saved me a huge headache since my problems do not seem to be unusual.", "Date": "April 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "OK, but 2 problems...", "Author": "KCHomer", "ReviewID": "R21WGSPUSDV3E5", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "The 2 main problems I have with this camera are 1, the batteries stink and 2, the viewing screen is great but, in making it so large, you lose the viewfinder and in doing so, you are out of luck when trying to view the screen in bright sunlight.

Other than that, it does have nice features, but the way up close, trying to zoom in and focus problems that other reviewers have noted are true.", "Date": "April 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nice Stills, Intuitive UI, HD movies very nice under optimal conditions", "Author": "P. Wieselquist \"Peter Wieselquist\"", "ReviewID": "R2JNXFAB1Y9V01", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Look, this is a family snapshot camera, so my rating is based on one thing only - what I call the \"dummy mode keeper ratio\" or DMKR. In other words, after shooting a typical family event on auto mode, it's a good cam if I'm not deleting lots of shots for bad quality (over-flashed, grainy, blurry). I don't care about software or docks, Picasa works for me for retouching.I've owned several cameras over the years, mostly Lumix and Kodak. So far this one seems to have a good DMKR, so it looks like a keeper, but I need to do more test shots.  As a parent chasing active kids trying to capture some spontaneous moments...there's usually no time to use \"scenes\" or mess with the manual settings. If this doesn't sound like you, disregard my opinion altogether.The UI is nice. Buttons well-placed and the 4-way joystick is implemented intuitively with the menu structure. I didn't find myself hunting around for the right setting. Low-light shots on this cam I thought were pretty decent for this class of camera. 5x zoom is good for this size cam. Any higher wouldn't work in this size body, so there goes your portability advantage.Now the video: My expectatons for this cam were simple. Can I leave the HD camcorder at home on outdoor family outings? The short answer is yes, but be careful. Here's what I've discovered:1. You can zoom in *before* you start shooting, just hold the camera very steady (or tripod it) and avoid panning around while zoomed in or the clip's going to be  very jumpy.2. Do not zoom in while shooting, the lens won't focus fast enough and you'll ruin the clip.3. Stick with outdoor use. As you might guess, indoor low-light clips will look grainy and noisy.Summary: For the price, I'd say it's a good do-it-all snapshot camera for the money. And it your video expectations are not too high, this can even double as your camcorder.", "Date": "March 26, 2009"}, {"Title": "Kodak Camera", "Author": "W.
