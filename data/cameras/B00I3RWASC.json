The shutter speed is too slow most of the time. Blurred shots are common. I love the idea behind it but it needs much improving. Costs too much for the  images you're getting.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Another Direction for Photography", "Author": "Whinge", "ReviewID": "R179Z22EKKOD1M", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Once switched on and left to its own devices its cheerful screen and quiet sounds go dark and it automatically begins taking what in earlier days were called 'snapshots' meaning uncomposed, often poorly lit, and mostly random pictures of those people and things around you. They're sometimes blurry with questionable exposure and an overabundance of everyone's most unfortunate camera angles - you'll save about 10% of them. They'll never make National Geographic and frankly, they're pictures you'd never take yourself but that is the point entirely. With uncanny ability, Autographer chronicles life's most unphotographed and intimate moments with a detached but personal perspective that is at times both unnerving and humbling. Reviewing the previous day's bustle often results in a surprisingly nuanced look at what you've missed the past 24 hours.", "Date": "April 7, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00I3RWASC"}}
