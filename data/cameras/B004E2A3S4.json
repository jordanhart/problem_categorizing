It is very easy for him to operate and he just loves it. The sound effects are great as well and he gets in to it. My only issues is that sometimes the images on the screen look like they are done in crayon and have colored shadows. We haven't had any luck figuring this out, but my son loves it so I'm happy.", "Date": "February 17, 2014"}, {"Title": "perfect for my toddler who wants to take pictures", "Author": "L Amandi", "ReviewID": "R3UBB547IPX7H3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's very simple and durable enough for a reasonably capable toddler or big kid. My only complaints are that the sound effects are a bit noisy when the buttons are pushed (which we may be able to change - but I haven't figured it out yet) and the viewing screen could be a bit larger. But all in all it is pretty great! She handles it very well (2 1/2 years old) and learned the simple ins and outs in a few minutes.", "Date": "January 8, 2014"}, {"Title": "Has no zoom, pictures not very good quality.", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "RQZ84FUCL21KB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Bought this for christmas for my 5 yr old, he hasn't gotten it yet, but I tried it out first. First thing I noticed is that it had absolutely no zoom, I don't know why I did not realize that, but I caught it one the black friday flash deal for $27.99, which it's going for 28.74 right now a week later, so I guess the flash deal wasn't that great. The pictures are not very good either, I expected better for 7mp, it looks worse than my old 3mp camera's pics.  ***This camera requires a memory card*** It also takes 2 AA batteries, I use rechargeable, and they were VERY hard to get in, the battery door screws shut and there are two little holes the batteries go in, for some reason rechargeable batteries are \"fatter\" than regular batteries (I noticed this in the xbox controllers too) and they just barely fit in the holes, one did not fit at all, I had to try several to get one that would fit. The kids wanted cameras for Christmas, and I wanted something that wouldn't be too complicated, and wouldn't break the first time he dropped it.", "Date": "December 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "My daughter loves it very much\uff01", "Author": "XINGXIA LAI", "ReviewID": "R1929QA2J4576N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "There are two handles on it , I think it is easy for children to make a photo.
