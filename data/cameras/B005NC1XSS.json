No not really", "Author": "booda", "ReviewID": "RS9KXJYICSR4N", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in April of 12' specifically for a trip I planned to Mexico in December. I had time to get used to using it, my big mistake was not trying it out in the pool. Four days into our trip we got to do some snorkeling (the reason I bought the camera in the first place). The camera worked great for about two hours afterward. It was in salt water so after we got out I rinsed it gently with fresh water and towel dried it. When we were on the bus back to the hotel I wanted review the pics I took and when I turned the screen on it was black. The camera still worked but the screen was out of commission. So four days into my seven day trip my camera was worthless. Upon returning home I contacted Nikon for warranty service which was not without aggravation, I'll spare the details. They're promise was to return it to me within 7 to 10 days. It's been ten days so far and they still have the camera. I was not impressed with the service from anyone I spoke to at Nikon and after using their \"waterproof to 33 ft\" in three feet of water and have it fail miserably I wouldn't recommend this camera or any Nikon product after my experience.", "Date": "December 28, 2012"}, {"Title": "AW 100 NIKON COOLPIX", "Author": "Joseph Patrick McGee \"BIG JOE\"", "ReviewID": "R23Z8NO8N8RA25", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "THE PACKAGE DEAL IS THE WAY TO GO.

You will not regret your choice. Perfect as a gift too!Recently purchased the AW100 Nikon Coolpix camera, and decided to get the accessory kit. It is the perfect thing to get when purchasing a camera. It comes with all sorts of goodies. I havent individually priced out each item and added it all up, but it still seems like a great deal for all the stuff you get with it. Both tripods are solid, the floating strap seems like it would do great, the extra battery is always a plus, and since i dont have a mini HDMI cable this is perfect to view videos and pictures on an HD tv. All the accessories that it comes with are high quality and are well worth the price.As for the camera, it is awesome. I bout this camera because I am outdoors a lot, and have clumsy hands. I didnt want to worry about having to drop my camera and be concerned whether or not it will be damaged. The construction of the camera is super solid, it feels like you could not out a wild animal if you threw it at it. The pictures are great at close to medium range, but at long distances especially when zoomed all the way it gets a little poopy. The videos you can record are top notch, no need for a camcorder now!The GPS function is so handy, most cameras should come with this feature, especially if your an outdoors person. Have yet to test the waterproofness of the camera, so I am hoping that this will work when the time comes. The camera definitely does what you want it to do, and since it is a Nikon you know you got the goods. I am in no way a picky person, so this camera is perfect. If are disposed to pick everything apart and complain about every little thing, than you may not agree with me.PROS-Solid desing-Great pictures when close or at medium distance-Videos are amazing-Features are great-compact, easy to use-color of the camera is vibrant and great looking-if you got the orange color you wont be loosing it when oustide.CONS-Long distance shots not so good-A little slow- only a few seconds after each shot. Might find this an issue if you like things to be  instantaneous.If you are looking to get a tough camera, get the Nikon AW100, and get it with this bundle.", "Date": "November 6, 2012"}, {"Title": "easy to use", "Author": "Elaghaka", "ReviewID": "R12Z7ZUMZXFPHB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Light, strong and easy to use. this device has all of necesary things to get outdor pictures.
