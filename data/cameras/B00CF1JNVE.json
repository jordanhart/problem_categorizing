I am a beginner user so I didn't know what I might need.  There are extra lenses, cleaning supplies, extra batteries, a tripod, and much more.  The camera is fantastic.  It has the auto features I need to fall back on when I get in a situation I can't manage the manual controls.  I recommend going through each page of the manual to see all the functions and the combinations.  There are even some photoshop options built in before the pic hits your computer for editing.  There are also some great in between modes that allow you to have some control over shutter speed and aperture while locking in others.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "T5i two thumbs up", "Author": "Clay", "ReviewID": "R1A5NOZ31DTUVP", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This bundle package had everything I needed and then some.

But the main lens the EF-S 18-55 was not there.  There was a EF-MM in the box but that lens does not fit the T5i.  A call to Amazon customer service was a nightmare.  The representitive was rude spoke broken english that require repeating information several times.  After trying to speak to this person for about 45 minutes nothing was resolved. I told him I want to return the bundle and he said I couldn't but someone would get back to me tomorrow.  So here's a camera missing the most important lens, Amazon got paid, and I sit and wait for someone to call me back.  This is the worst customer service I have ever encountered.", "Date": "November 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "Performance+", "Author": "David H.

Haven't used the camera or lenses yet but everything advertised in the bundle was included. It even came with 4 batteries, instead of two and one WAS a Canon battery, which the product description did not indicate would be included. The package arrived in excellent condition and all items were packed safely. We will update this review after using all accessories and taking pictures.  As always, Amazon comes through and even though we haven't used the camera yet, we wanted to comment on the speed with which we received our purchase and the boxing and condition of the equipment when received.", "Date": "November 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "This is great", "Author": "Satyendra", "ReviewID": "R3TBLPCFJF8TMR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Guys This is great camera n my first SLR ...

This was purchased for me as a Christmas gift and.I anxiously awaited getting it, when I opened it I immediately started testing out all the lenses....then I got to the 18-55 mm lens....however instead of the lens for the camera I got they sent an ef lens that is way to.small for the camera...how does this happen.in a bundle!? I was pleased with everything else in the.bundle so I decided to call and see about sending the wrong lens back and getting the correct one...well first off there is no number listed for the actual company I purchased this from, second when I went to use the e mail.option I couldn't even e mail the company...so.I called Amazon, the only option they gave me was to return the whole thing as to not \" break up a bundle\" well shouldn't their to priority be making customers who already purchased this happy? I told them.I would call.back if I decided to do this as I wanted to rethink it (I wanted to look and see if I coukd find any good deals because obviously I wouldn't order the same bundle from davismax again) and I wanted to call back since the only way to get free return shipping is to schedule a ups pickup...so what does the guy do, schedules  the pickup anyways and the poor ups guy came here and I had nothing to ship out....we had decided to keep this bundle as the only ones I saw that were quality equivelant were more expensive and the ones that came with the same amount of lenses didn't offer Canon.lenses which this bundle had 3 of the 5 that were Canon.....so we decided to sell the too small lens (it's going for 99 on amazon now) and repurchase the correct lens (125 on amazon)", "Date": "December 28, 2013"}, {"Title": "Easy to understand and operate.", "Author": "Mrs. Brenda Coleman", "ReviewID": "R2W8NR29XINDM9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am just really getting into DSLR photography and wanted to start with something just a bit more than a simple digital camera with auto everything.  This bundled package provided everything to get started and experience more than point and shoot.  Everything from telephoto to macro and wide angle are possible and I have played with all of it and am having a great time in the process.  I am not even what could be considered an amature at DSLR or any type of photography for that matter but this package was put together I think with people like me in mind.  The manual with the EOS T5i is very easy to understand and I was up and shooting in several different formats in no time.  It took longer to register the camera and all the lenses than it did to read and understad all the basics in the manual.  Again I am no expert and have had a couple different Nicon cameras, a Sony and an Olympus in the early digital days and this Canon EOS was much easier to understand and operate; even in manual modes.  The only issue I had with this bundle was the full size tri pod came with a broken bracket where it connects to the base.  I am not sure it is repairable but Amazon took care of the issue with a 10% refund of the overall cost.  This refund is more than sufficient to buy me a new and even better tri pod if I can't repair the one I received.  But overall I am very satisfied with my purchase.", "Date": "December 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is so goog!!!", "Author": "Andres Magallanes", "ReviewID": "RETZZPPDF2XF1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I'm from Peru.
