Puri \"mpuri\"", "ReviewID": "R30BVT8DJ7IQRY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start with stating that most point and shoot cameras are compromise on various basic performance parameters. I bought this camera for my wife for whom any feature beyond the basic auto mode is unnecessary. For a point and shoot it has lots of very advanced features typically available in dslr or prosumer cameras. I am talking about things like bracketing( takes pictures at different exposure level), dynamic range optimizer and my favorite live histogram. Let me summarize its positives and negatives:- Wide angle lens 30mm to 150mm (5x zoom)- Image stabilizer is very good, I have taken very good pictures at 1/4sec & iso 100. Basically it will let you take good pictures at low iso(to avoid noise), where you can not use flash.-DRO (dynamic range optimizer): Autmatically adjusts for a balance between highlight & shadows, two different levels of DRO available- Live histogram: I have this feature in my nikon 8400 (prosumer camera)and is very useful for adjusting exposure in extreme lighting conditions e.g. daylight scenery in Yosemite, Bryce. Metering systems of most cameras  can not keep up with such extreme lighting conditions.- Three levels for flash. Soft flash for closeups, standard, flash+ for far away objects.- Colors: It has very bright and saturated colors even in basic color mode. If you are mainly going to use it take pictures of kids, you may like prints from it. I am used to subdued colors of Nikon.Now the negatives, some of which could be a problem for someone. - In auto mode, it pushes up the iso to 400 therefore producing grainy pictures. - Flash is underpowered, stated range is 4.3m. I would stick to half that distance for decent pictures. - You can restrict the iso to below 200 to keep noise low. I have found that even at iso of 100 the detail in pictures is not that good. My theory is that it has a very strong noise reduction algorithm at all iso's. If you are mainly going to take 4x6 pictures this might not be an issue for you.I hope this review is useful in your decision making.", "Date": "May 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Camera Jam Packed with Features", "Author": "D. Savaya", "ReviewID": "R3PD284JOOY6EV", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera as soon as it was made available April 28, 2008.I think this camera is perfect.  It takes great pictures all on its own.  There is no need for you to know about the aperture, focal length, lighting, ISO settings, etc.  Simply put the camera in easy or auto mode and shoot to your heart's content.  The picture colors are amazingly accurate and vibrant.The smile shutter feature is pretty cool also.  Simply put the camera in smile mode push down the shutter once and wait for your subject to smile.  You'll be able to take six smile shots without having to press the shutter button.Another cool feature is the in camera editing.  Say a subject did not smile as big as you had hoped, you are able to go into the editing feature in the camera and make the smile more evident. To me, that's cool! You are also able to remove redeye, sharpen the picture and crop the picture all by using the camera.  You no longer have to upload them to the computer to do these fixes.The battery life is very good and you don't even need a memory stick to shoot up to 10 pictures because of the installed 15 MB of memory.  It's not a whole lot, but it helps if you are in a pinch for a shot and a memory card is not handy.The screen is very clear and very large.  The colors are accurate and very bright.  The camera is lightweight yet not flimsy.  It feels like a solidly built camera.I really haven't seen anything to complain about.  I think everything this camera offers for the price is well worth it.  I am very happy with the black color as well.  I think Black goes with everything and that's why I didn't choose a different color.If you are on the fence about this camera, I can just say that my experience has been very positive and I think yours will be as well.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Fast, Great Quality, Lots of Adjustment Options", "Author": "MangoMania", "ReviewID": "R2D17TK4FEOL6U", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is great compared to many many many similarly priced cameras I tried out.  It takes pictures really fast and is ready for the next one very quickly too.  These were big considerations when I was shopping around and this one is the fastest.  The camera takes great pictures with the automatic settings compared to others that didn't seem to know when flash or other adjustments should have been necessary/unnecessary.  The smile shutter is cool but I don't think I'll use it often.  The 5x zoom is great.  The in camera image alteration is neat too, especially the feature to make people appear smiling.  Good for a lot of laughs.  The rechargeable battery seems to be holding up well.  I love the deep red but the sheen makes it appear pink in some lights.  It looks bigger than other cameras but really is at most only 2-3 mm wider than the canon elph sd1100/750.", "Date": "May 20, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good Compact Camera", "Author": "bio_hazard391", "ReviewID": "R3KYA6KRN0TUOQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Before I decided to buy the Sony Cybershot DSC W150, I really looked into many cameras and models.  The big factors I was looking for: compact in size, optical or electronic viewfinder, 5x or more optical zoom, adjustable LCD display (LCD screen that folds out and can be adjusted to be viewed from different angles or closed towards the camera to protect it).  This camera is comparable in size to the Canon elph series, which is great for factor 1.  A basic optical viewfinder is present on the camera which although doesn't have any special features (it's not an EVF and is on the small side) is great to have for shooting in bright sunlight and saving battery power. I can't stand cameras that don't have a viewfinder and absolutely refuse to buy a camera without one, which unfortunately ruled out many compacts currently on the market.  Factor 2 good enough to me.  Camera has a 5x Optical zoom which as of this review is starting to get more popular with the compacts for many companies.  There is a 2x Digital zoom also, which I felt would have been better as a 4x or higher Digital zoom but not too big of a deal since the Optical zoom is what really matters.  Factor 3, check for the Cybershot.  Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a compact that had an adjustable LCD display, which is disappointing because I've gotten so used to having one on my Canon Powershot A95.  The only thing that might be sacrificed with an adjustable LCD display is the screen size, which unfortunately so many camera makers seem to be focusing on having huge energy draining screens.  So I compromised on this factor and went with the Cybershot DSC W150 with it's non adjustable 2.7\" screen.  As for shooting modes, they're not too different (if at all) than other typical point and shoot cameras on the market, and more or less function the same.  The in-camera editing features are pretty cool and can add some style and effects to your pics.  As usual, there are many accessories that don't come included such as a telephoto lens (VCL-D2046), a wide angle lens (VCL-D0746), the adaptor ring for these lenses (VAD-WE), a silicon camera jacket (LCJ-WA) and even more such as a better not included battery and battery charger, adapter and camera protective cases.  I think they really should have included the silicon camera jacket with the camera instead of selling it for around $25-30 each, it is just a protective case of silicon, after all...  Overall, I'm satisfied with this camera and enjoy using it, but I still think there is a lot of room for improvement within the compact point and shoot camera line for all companies, and hope that not all companies will continue to go the path of bigger LCD screens and getting rid of traditional camera features such as a viewfinder.", "Date": "May 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Nice Compact Point and Shoot", "Author": "artnuvo", "ReviewID": "R2AJ4CF3BDM8PP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We own two-a silver and a red cybershot, so that my wife and I will be able to take the photos we want particularly on an upcoming Galapagos cruise. The large LCD screen is bright in near-direct to direct sunlight, something that is completely lacking in my 2-year old Pentax Optio 6mp and one reason for buying this camera.  Continuous shutter speed is fast for moving objects-again something totally lacking in the Pentax which has very slow shutter speed and produces nothing but blurs for moving objects.  The large optical zoom is another plus.  So far, nice pictures are produced in low light with and without flash and the Smile feature is interesting and works. It has 2 menus.  The \"Home Menu\", which is not the easiest to navigate, provides options like varying iso, smile, continuous shutter, etc. The hard copy operating manual that comes with the camera provides the basics; the software CD manual provides sufficient detail tho it would have been nice to have that in its 130-page hard copy version.  Battery takes about 4-5 hours to recharge which is about the same as my for my Pentax but the charger is more compact and plugs in the wall rather than requiring a bulkier cord attachment.  Cost downsides are the proprietary memory stick-duo--a 2gb which my camera onscreen indicates will be good for 800+ pics at the third or mid-range pixel setting good for 4X6 and larger, typically runs $20-25 and proprietary battery which in its o.e.m. version can be bought for about $15--about the same cost as aftermarket lithium batteries for my Pentax and more costly than the AA batteries used  in a 1-year old Casio ExLim7mp that stopped working for no discernible reason and was not worth repairing. A U.K. camera review for the Sony says that this sony will take more than 2x the pics of an equivalent Canon elph before the battery has too be recharged-we'll see.  I went with an extra proprietary battery becuase an aftermarket battery,costing a few dollars less, produced a \"no signal\" message\" on both cameras despite its being advertised as compatible with this model.", "Date": "June 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor picture quality", "Author": "Nerdhead", "ReviewID": "R9T97RB8BUWRU", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Purchased this from Amazon almost a month ago.  I used it and compared it to a Nikon 5200 and Canon A610, both of which were 5 megapixel.  What is shocking is the low quality of the pictures, which on close examination turn out to contain a high amount of digital noise and other signs of poor image processing.  The Nikon has noisy images, but the Sony is noticeably worse than even that.  The Canon is phenomenal in that area, with no digital noise and excellent shading in dark areas.  The poor picture quality persisted even after setting the Sony's resolution to 5 megapixels (along with other parameters) to match the other cameras.Even though the Sony has 8.1 megapixels, it doesn't show or matters. I can not imagine cropping and blowing up a section for printing (which might at times be the whole purpose of taking a high resolution image to begin with).  The issue here seems to be another case of a camera maker cramming too many megapixels into a too-small sensor, resulting in poor images.The camera looks very nice, is solidly built with a metal body, and is easy to use.  It's actually one of the best looking cameras I've seen.  But the picture quality is a huge negative.  I'm not sure if the firmware is upgradable, maybe alleviating some of its problems, but even so, I've never found Sony to be too responsive in releasing upgrades in response to customer complaints.I tried to like the camera, but unfortunately it's going back to Amazon.For those who might be interested in some of the technical details:The Canon A610 has a 1/1.8 CCD sensor with total size of 58.08 sq. mm., while the W-150 has a 1/2.5 sensor sized at 24.71 sq. mm.  In short, the Sony is cramming approximately 35% more pixels into a sensor which is 57% smaller than the Canon's.  Even though the W-150 touts its sensor as a Super HAD CCD (meaning it has an optimized proprietary on-chip micro-lens system resulting in better sensitivity), it can't overcome the problems caused by its higher pixel density here.", "Date": "December 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Pictures, Not as Reliable as the Old Sonys", "Author": "Hugh", "ReviewID": "R3DS02WRZZQPWT", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've owned this camera for several months now. It's mainly my wife's camera. She carries it in her purse most days.I'll start with the negatives and then get to the positives:The charger requires you to remove the battery to charge it. You cannot operate the camera from any power supply in the meantime. Rarely did I ever do this with my old Sony, but I did do it a few times. This gives you no option other than buying more accessories from Sony, which is where they always get you.The charger is unreliable. If you put the battery in and you walk away, there's probably a 30% chance that it won't charge. Rather the light will blink identifying some problem. I jiggle the battery in and out, and it starts working again. This has left us with a dead battery on more than one occasion.The lens cover that automatically closes to protect it - very flimsy. Ours broke after a short time of my wife carrying this in her purse. I'm sure it had makeup and stuff bouncing off of it, but the old Sony stood the test of time for 3 years of the same abuse. In fact, that camera still works if you're careful to make sure the shots are in focus (remember I mentioned half the shots are bad these days - thats if you don't concentrate)We asked someone to take a picture of us and they dug their fingernail tip into the button. The silver covered plastic is now permanently dented. Again, I know this isn't regular usage, but the old Sony has had dozens of random people snap our picture without fail.The size of the camera - for a really compact camera, this is not very compact. It's actually larger than our older Sony (which had almost all the same features). I expected in three years of development that they'd miniaturize more of it, or at least reduce its weight. It's actually heavier, too. This need for more space may have led to the off-board charger.Classic Sony accessories game - The Memory Stick required for this always costs more than the comparable SD cards used in many other brands. If it wasn't for the overall quality and features of Sony stuff, I'd avoid it due to the ridiculous accessory prices.And now what I actually like about this camera:5x Optical Zoom! Wow, that's a lot in the world of compact cameras. I never turn on digital zoom (as that's just a waste of pixels) so this 5x was a major selling point for me. It is noticeably different than 4x.It takes great pictures most of the time. With my last camera, I started getting bad shots about every other pic.. so we upgraded and that problem is gone.The features are easy to handle. Any moron could operate this camera in Easy Mode. Even the same person could handle the auto modes with a little light reading. This camera is easy to use.Looks - It looks really good. A lot of people have complimented us for having a cool looking camera. (I believe the black helps that) I realize the point is not the looks, but these colors sure seem to influence sales.Summary: This is a nice camera. Take care of it, and it should serve you well for a while. I will have to send mine in for repair, and then it will be treated as a fragile item for the rest of its service life. I can't assume that this camera will be nearly as tough as the old Sony I had. In this age of Chinese produced crap, this camera is a shining example of lack of durability.

Looking for a nice compact point and shoot for my wife.  Ease of use and picture quality were top of the wish list and the Sony went 1 of 2.  Ease of use is very good on this model but the kicker was picture quality.  The camera I had was extremely inconsistent on picture quality.  Outdoor shots looked great but indoor shots (with and without flash) were very poor.  The problem ranged from out of focus (at any zoom level) to washed out colors and pixelated prints.

Then waited for this one to be available on the market and Sony seems to keep impressing and improving their line of point and shoot cameras.I had my old camera for 1 year, and I take pictures quite often. This camera focus very nice and takes sharp pictures on all occacions. Extra zoom (I had the sony W90 and P200 just with 3X) is great. Controls are easy to use, easy to understand and it comes packed with lots of pictures, including \"smile detection\" tech. I tried it and it works just fine.I can keep going and going but it would be easier to read the specs, I can resume this review with: \"BUY IT\" you won't regret it, it is a great camera with a great price, I've had it for about 3 weeks already and taken hundreds of pictures, if not thousands.Edited 10/11/09After over a year of owning this product, I would take 1 or 2 stars away from my initial review. I have a 1 year old son, so I began giving a lot of extra work to the camera.I had a big disappointment when it came to shooting at night or on low light conditions. I like testing over and over with different settings to get the perfect picture. I've tried using auto mode, program mode, ISO mode, less flash on the pictures, you name it, even took some advices from the internet. Focus is not ok, grainy pictures, too much noise on them. Need to take lots of pictures just to see what works the best, and still I can't get a decent picture. some of them are ok, but most of them are not.After being so disappointed at this I've been researching and reading different reviews on different cameras. Seems it's hard to find a point and shoot that can take nice pictures with low light conditions. I was hoping the new sony WX/1 would fix that, but so far the reviews talk about similar results. I am reading about a panasonic camera that ppl had said it does a nice work, but it doesn't have manual controls like the sony. not sure what I will do, and if I get the panasonic or the sony wx/1 I'll be shooting low light conditions and write a review asap.", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "great compact camera", "Author": "Julian Trejos Zelaya", "ReviewID": "R3S4IEEI51AFH7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got my camera yesterday, It's an awesome poduct.

The lens is very good, going from wide angle ot tele. It's a good thing to have a  nice little piece of engineering that has a very convenient size.

Our last 3 cameras were Canons... but my wife and I decided that we'd give Sony a try. We liked the bright, crisp screen, the compactness of the camera, the quick startup time, the long zoom range (5x optical), the convenient settings dial, the layout of all the buttons, the ease of use of the menu options and basic camera functions, slideshow playback (with music), and let's be honest here, it's nice to have a camera in the color you like (rather than the boring silver/black). Everything seemed fine from what we could tell on our visits to Best Buy.But after we got the camera, we started to see some things that we couldn't tell from our trips to the store.- Poor image quality. Pictures look fine when resized to fit your computer monitor, but when you zoom in to the actual size of the picture, you'll notice that the quality is not that sharp.- Shutter delay. I know that all cameras have some shutter delay, but it was quite noticeable and annoying on this camera. It takes longer than it should to focus, especially in medium- to low-light. (It was fine at the store, but then again, the store is pretty bright.) The delay is even worse with the flash.- Slow flash. You can't set the flash to red-eye or no red-eye. You can only turn the flash on and off. That means that the camera will sometimes do the red-eye flash if you don't want it to... so by the time it actually snaps the picture (after the focus delay, of course), you've already lost your photo moment. This is especially true for taking pics of our baby. There's no way around it.- Smile feature. We actually LOVED this feature, especially when you give smile-priority to your child -- so that when your child finally smiles, it snaps the picture. The bad thing is that you have to be literally smiling ear-to-ear (which looks very unnatural) for it to take your pic. Same for the child/baby. Nice idea Sony, but bad execution. It'd be nice if you could set the smile threshhold/meter to a lower setting, so that you don't have to smile as big.- Few manual settings. I generally like to mess around with some basic settings -- like flash, no-flash, no-red-eye-flash, white balance, exposure, etc. These are pretty basic functions, but these are difficult to change on this camera because you just can't change these things easily or at all. I feel constricted to only do what the camera 'allows' me to do, which is very little. It's fine for people who are brand new to digital cameras, but not ideal for anyone else.- Video quality/size. By default, I believe the video size is set to 320. The quality is absolutely *horrendous* at this setting. But if you increase the size to 640, the video is very nice -- but the file size is absolutely *huge* (compared to Canons, where the size is much smaller for a 640 video). On the positive side, there's no time limit on the video, so you can shoot as long as you want. But be warned, it will eat up space on your computer very quickly!!These nuisances made us fed up within a week. We've traded in our Sony for a trusty Canon.

On the positive side, it has great features which is what attracted me to it. It also has a quality feel when held in the hand. However, it fails where it counts and that is in image quality. I am by no means a novice and this camera produces inconsistent images.  Indoor, the weak flash raises the ISO level so that the result is a grainy photo. Some face shots are acceptable and some are washed out. Image quality outdoor is also inconsistent.

It took great pictures and unexpectedly was able to capture things in unusual light I didn't think it would handle.  However, I had several problems.  I attempted to take several pictures of camouflaged critters, and the camera just couldn't focus.  I tried multiple settings, but the lizards and bugs were not patient enough for me to work until I could find a setting that would focus in close up conditions on a hard to distinguish subject.  I still haven't figured out how to get this to happen and the companion instruction book offered no help that I could find for this kind of thing.  The other problem I had is that the camera seemed to occasionally lose its little mind.  I would turn on the review function and start paging back through my pictures, and the camera would turn itself on and drop out of review mode.  Sometimes no matter what I tried to do it would not allow me to review my pictures.  This issue would clear up if I left the camera off for a few hours.  Then sometimes I would have it on a setting on the dial and be taking pictures and the menu describing the dial settings would appear on screen and rotate through settings without me touching the setting dial.  At times it would do this rapidly.  To get it to stop I turned off the camera.  When I turned it back on, this problem would mysteriously have resolved itself.

Since I decided to buy two ultra-compact cameras, it took me several weeks reading professional and customer reviews on the subject. When looking at the latter, I found that every reviewed camera, even the higher rated, had a few really awful reviews. That made it very difficult for me to make a decision. Then, I decided to give more consideration to the average rating and the \"pros\" reviews. I also took a pick at what many of my friends were carrying around. I handled - yet just for short periods of time - compact Cannon's, Pentax's, Nikon's and - of course - Sony's. I was attracted by the very nice built of the Sony's and the fact that they were the only ones among those that I touched that have an optical viewfinder. I read articles and heard people minimizing the importance of that feature all time, but I really find it a life saving when shooting under strong sun light or darkness . All the cameras I saw, made it very hard to frame scenes under those conditions and I naturally found my self taking pictures with the viewfinder. Also it was very useful in saving battery life. So, reviews, hands on and good built led me to choose the Sony cameras. After I actually bought them, I was very pleased with the results. The vast majority of pictures I took, under the most different situations, came out good. Colors were accurate and shooting speed very acceptable. Battery life is great, as well. If one is not expecting lots of manual controls and magazine grade pictures, he will be happy with those cameras.I gave the 150 to my wife and kept the 120 to myself. How about the other 150? Well, I think that is the highlight of the this review. People write all the time to complain about Customer Services, not just Sony's, but all of them. I am writing for the opposite reason. It so happened that when I bought the first 150 and took it outside for a test drive, I \"managed\" to give it a horrible fall. The kind of accident in which when you try to prevent the fall you end up trowing the object even farther, higher and causing a worse crash. So I dropped the new camera on a concrete floor, just 30 minutes after unpacking it. After I contained my anger I picked up the remains; the camera would still turn on, but it would shut off in few seconds. The lens, which were exposed during the fall, would not retract anymore. The first thing I did was to go back to my computer and order another W150. That was my wife's gift and was apologizing to her as I placed that second order.That done, what to do with the broken camera? After a few considerations between giving it away, or just throwing it in the garbage, I decided to send it to Sony and find out how much it would be to repair it, if at all possible. From the Sony repair site I got a work order number, printed a UPS label ($6 charge on my credit card) and next day I shipped the camera. I included a note telling the whole story, exactly as I am doing here. Then I followed up the process daily at Sony repair site; I saw when they received it, when it was being handled by a technician and... when they shipped it back to me!!!! The whole thing did not take ten days... and they did not charge me a penny for the repair!!!. And it had been all my fault. Finally, when the repaired camera arrived, I took a long session of photos with it and it is working perfectly as nicely as the second, brand new, I bought. Except for a few scratches in the body, it is as good as new. That is something I surely do not see everyday. Telling that story is the minimum I can do to thank Sony for their very nice attitude.Summarizing, I am very happy with the three cameras I bought. Clearly, this is not a technical review, I don't have a lab and I am not a professional photographer (I would not be buying point & shoot, if I was one). I am a normal guy who likes to go out taking pictures of everything I see, later review them on my computer screen and print a few that I want on paper. For that, the Sony's are doing a fine job. Even photos taken at higher ISO settings turned out very acceptable on a 6x4.I hope that helps in the tough decision you will have to make when picking up your next camera.", "Date": "March 1, 2009"}, {"Title": "Inconsistent quality, very disappointed, ended up returning it", "Author": "J.

I understand if quality is inconsistent taken in low light pictures, that is expected from most point and shoot cameras. But the inconsistency is noticeable in pictures taken in good lighting. On average only 2 out of 5 pictures taken were worth keeping, the remaining 3 were either blurred or with a lot of noise.I upgraded from a Canon A530, even comparing several shots from that camera, the quality of that old Canon beat this Sony; most of the Sony pictures had noise in it. I tried really hard to keep this camera, I tried several different setting with no success. In the end I ended up settling for the Canon SD1100IS, which only has a 3x optical zoom, but the picture quality is far better and very consistent. I was not surprised to see the DSCW150 camera as low as $170 in brick and mortar stores such as Target. The launching price was $249. This was a very poor first impression of Cybershot cameras for me. Hopefully the inconsistency of quality is limited to this model. I am really surprised that at the time of this writing this camera was rated at 4 stars.", "Date": "November 19, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Point and shoot camera", "Author": "C.

I reasearched the heck out of the point and shoots when I bought the camera, and for what I was looking for, this came out on top. Then again, any of the medium to upper priced digital cameras with good reviews will be a great. There are no manual adjustments on the W150, but plenty of scene selections and has an optical view finder. Most of these small camera's no longer have the optical view finder. Using the LCD display for the view finder during sports can be difficult since the display has a hard time tracking fast moving objects. The zoom is longer than most cameras in this class and the wide angle is a little more \"wide\". Nice to have. Another plus is all of the pictures that they and myself have taken have been good, excellent for the most part. The videos are good in decent light and overall this is an excellent camera. This camera just seems to pack more useful features than anything in this class. I will buy this or the next upgrade when my Canon dies. The Canons are great, but I dont think that any of them have the zoom range and optical view finder found on the 150.", "Date": "February 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Optical image stablization and 5x zoom make for a nice point and shoot.", "Author": "Geek with Kids \"Gary\"", "ReviewID": "R35ZTGVRRHAXUH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Got this point and shoot for my high school aged daughter who wanted a camera to take pics of friends and places that she's visited.  She had been disappointed by other point and shoot cameras that we had tried in the past, because the pictures would always come out blurry - the only way that we could take non-blurry shots was to use the countdown timer to take the shot, so that the act of pressing the shutter release wouldn't cause the camera to move while taking the picture.  This is something that she couldn't be bothered to do, so she hated the pictures that she took.This camera has turned out to be great for her, and she is quite happy with it.  She gets lots of candid and posed shots, and almost all are blur-free.  The extra zoom range works out well, allowing nicer closeups that you would expect in this class of camera.Note that my older daughter, who is a camera snob (takes very pretty \"artsy\" shots) doesn't like this camera, because she feels she doesn't have enough control over her shots - her Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom is the one for her.Pros:Optical image stabilization works quite well.5x Zoom is better than standard for this class.Face finder and \"smile detection\" seems like a gimmick but works surprisingly well.Large screen AND zoom optical viewfinder cover all situations.Cons:Sony memory stick means less choices and higher prices, can't as easily find a replacement.Not taking AA batteries means you should probably get a second rechargeable battery.Not all that good in lower light without flash - ISO 400 is pretty much the limit.All-in-all, I'd buy this camera again.  I've been quite happy with the value and performance, even when keeping in mind the Cons listed above.Update after 10 months with this camera:Wow, this camera continues to amaze!  I frequently ask my daughter to borrow it for occasions that I want a \"pocketable\" camera.  The extra zoom (5x) and Sports mode take excellent shots at soccer games, and we've gotten amazing shots of fireworks with the fireworks mode.We liked it so much, that when the next daughter wanted a camera, she said that she wanted one like this.  We looked at the newer Sony w-series cameras, and read reviews of the images all turning out \"soft\" or slightly fuzzy.  We ended up ordering another of this model for her, as well.Like others, I recommend getting another battery - specifically, get the InfoLithium battery Sony NP-FG1 InfoLITHIUM Type G Rechargeable Li-Ion Battery Pack for Sony W & H Series Digital Cameras and put it in the camera so that 1) you have a spare, and 2) you know how long your battery is going to last.", "Date": "November 22, 2008"}, {"Title": "Sony Camera", "Author": "Kimberly I.

It is about the size of a deck of cards so it fits easily into a jacket pocket or a purse.  As it is small, one needs to be careful with finger placement so as not to obstruct the flash or the AF lamp.The LCD is bright and clear.  It is easy to view indoors even under poor lighting.  It works well outdoors, but washes out when bright sunlight shines directly on the screen.  This is when one appreciates having an optical viewfinder even if it is small.  As the LCD picks up fingerprints easily, one does well to keep a cleaning cloth [such as an eyeglass cleaning cloth] close by.I have taken just over 200 pictures.  I am delighted with the photo quality.  The pictures are crisp.  The colors are true.  It captures details wonderfully.  It performs well with both indoor and outdoor shots.  Even photos snapped without the flash in poor lighting generally turn out well producing nice, clear 4x6 and 5x7 inch prints. [Perhaps even larger prints but I have not tried.]The modes I have used most are:*  Program Mode: has automatic settings but also allows the user to adjust some settings such as ISO, EV, Metering Mode, and Flash Strength*  Smile Mode: sets the camera to take pictures only when the person smiles*  High Sensitivity [ISO] Mode: automatically turns off the flash and boosts the ISO for low light situationsI have not experimented with the movie mode so cannot comment on how well it works.As for negatives, photo playback is slow to load. Not a major thing as the camera may be set to photo review which displays the photo taken for 2 seconds.For those who are in search of a point and shoot camera which takes great pictures with little effort on the user's part, I would recommend placing this camera on your short list.I am very pleased with my purchase and think you will be too.", "Date": "August 5, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very delighted", "Author": "Rinaldo Maldera", "ReviewID": "R2HPWQNUCPIMU5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very pleased with the camera after taking more than 200 shots in a little amount of time.

I wanted something with a decent lens and 5x optical zoom and 8-10MP all at a small size and cost. After trying out all the cameras in this range i really liked the W150 and decided to buy it. It has not disappointed and performs very well. So far no problems.Pros:- Carls Ziess lens with 5x Optical zoom- 30mm Wide angle Lens- Optical Image Stabilizer works well- Great overall picture qualityCons:- Red eye problems- Mediocre performance at 4-5x zoom- Complicated Interface and Button PlacementsHowever biggest downfall for me in this camera is the zoom, at 5x optical the picture quality is mediocre. But it seems that all compact cameras become inferior in quality at maximum zoom. So if i were to shop again i would buy something with 3x optical as 5x is too much for a compact Point and Shoot. This also helps reducing blare due to reduced zoom and weight.Overall a great unit but it has its limitations.

Also, the image stabilization doesn't seem to work as well as my Canon a570is.  The 5x zoom is nice.  The picture quality is acceptable.  One thing I did notice is that the camera compresses the images more for review - you can see JPEG artifacts and some loss of detail.  Don't worry, they look fine once you get them off the camera.The color balance and saturation is different than Canon's.  Everything looks less vibrant, but more realistic.I would suggest buying an extra battery.  I got one for 15 including shipping on Ebay.Another con is the use of Memory Sticks, but when you think about it, you aren't going to be reusing a card from your camera for something else, so there's not really a big issue with it using a proprietary format other than the premium price.  However, you can get cheap memory sticks online.  I got my 4 gig for 11 at Deal Extreme.Another thing I didn't like is that it takes about 7 seconds to switch to picture review mode if you haven't gone to review mode since you last turned on your camera.  Canons switch to review mode in about .5 seconds, so it's quite noticeable.One thing I was going to complain about was the USB mode, because it extends the lens, but I figured it out - when connected to USB, hit the \"review\" button instead of the power button, and it will not extend the lens.Overall, I got this camera for 135 shipped so any flaws it has are pretty excusable.

Not sure what the price is showing now but I've watched it increase since we purchased it (for $178).  The pictures it takes are amazing.  In fact, we went to the zoo and after seeing both our pictures, I could've left my camera at home!  My pictures of the tigers looked like \"Went to zoo - look at the tigers\"; my daughter's pictures make you wonder if she might have been in the enclosure WITH the tigers!  The zoom- no matter how close- takes amazing pictures.Just one warning: Everyone loves to take pictures at the beach, my daughter is no exception.  She took it to the beach in 2009, but unfortunately didn't get the chance.  She had the camera in her bag on the first day, and although she never took it out, the humidity somehow got into the camera.  The beach bag was opened/closed a few times and combined with the wind, added a little sand.  The next time she tried to use it, she looked through the lens to see that it was blurry due to moisture and the lens cover wouldn't open all the way due to sand.  Because the warranty had expired by about 6 months, we looked into having it repaired.  Sadly, the minimum it would cost to even have it looked at was approximately 40-50% of the cost of the camera (prior to any possible charges that might be incurred).  That is why I stated in the first sentence that I'd watched the price increase - by the time I went to see what it would cost to replace, the camera a good deal more and continued to climb in price.  Understandable because it's a great camera - sad for us though. :(To summarize, the camera is great and takes fantastic pictures; just remember to take extra care when using in different environments!", "Date": "January 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "Won't buy another camera", "Author": "Joe", "ReviewID": "R13TH7FOE3A19C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is perfect.

And it doesn't matter how the settings are adusted -- it's always a few seconds delay, which means 75% of the time I miss whatever it was I was trying to capture in a picture. Also, this camera has no option at all for a time/date stamp. When I called Sony and asked about this, the gentleman I spoke with said they took it away because their customers don't like that feature. Well, I do. I don't think it would have been at all difficult for them to add that function with the option to hide it if it's not wanted, like most cameras, even cheap ones, do. Finally, picture quality. Almost half the time the pictures are just slightly blurry. Not too noticeable at a quick glance, but if you are looking longer or trying to edit the pictures for any reason, it becomes evident.

With or without the flash. Colors were always crisp, sharpness was excellent very very sharp! So I figured I needed another pocket camera, I mean after two years, sony has probably made better models. Well when I got DSC-W150 and took a first picture which looked very fine on it's nice big display, I then transfered it to PC and was horrified! The picture looked very very grainy, bluish, purplish, grayish spots are around most of the objects in the pictures. Sharpness is no good, objects blur around the edges..OMG!! I couldn't believe it, even after playing around and tweaking all kind of settings it's just HORRIBLE. Sony wants $200 for this? You guys lost you mind. Fix it! Bring back DSC-P150.

I own a DSC-W100 that takes very sharp photos.  However, it is starting to act up, so I bought a DSC-W150 for a trip to Africa, mostly because of its longer zoom range (30-150 mm equivalent instead of 38-114 mm equivalent).  It arrived only a couple of days before the trip, so I did an incomplete job of checking it out -- my fault, of course.  On the trip, I was raving to my wife about how great it was and proudly showing off the great images on the LCD back at the hotel each night.  But, when we got home and downloaded the images -- TERRIBLE.  Soft, blurry images, even in bright outdoor conditions.  At least half of my pix had to be culled, and many of the ones I've kept are awful, but I want them in the album for their subjects.  Why Sony would let its quality go down, apparently a ubiquitous problem with way too many of their models after the W100, escapes me.  It seems that they've bought into most Americans' fascination with lower price and smaller size and have done so at the expense of picture quality.  Shame on you, Sony.  I have so many of your batteries, rechargers, and memory sticks that I hate to change to another company -- probably Canon -- but I cannot be satisfied with these mushy, washed-out, low-contrast, low-saturation images -- even at 8 megapixels and with \"vivid\" color selected.
