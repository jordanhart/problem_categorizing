While the specs of a 10.1 MP and big screen sounded great, once we used it, it was very disappointing.  The screen is very grainy, which makes it hard to tell if the picture came out well or not.  Also, even though the it has a high megapixel count, the photos come out very grainy (even when set at the highest level).  It is automatically set to have no flash, so every time you turn it on, you have to change that setting.  There is no way to make 'auto-flash' the standard setting.  Overall, not a good buy, we have taken it back to the store, and are looking for a better option.", "Date": "January 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "not very good", "Author": "E.Noel...this game was fun but it could have ...", "ReviewID": "RMRJLIWTL8XPT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "i got this camera a while ago for Christmas and thought it would be good because of the megapixel count. it's not. it's very blurry. i would not recommend this to a friend! i now have to save up for another camera!", "Date": "June 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Don't  buy it", "Author": "Ana I.
