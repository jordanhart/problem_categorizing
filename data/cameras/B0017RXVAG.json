All three of these cameras have experienced the same lens error at least twice.  The camera will not work at all. The three cameras have been sent in 6 times all together so far, and my daughter's camera is once again saying lens error.  It's RIDICULOUS!  Kodak fixed mine after the warranty was expired, saying it was a one time courtesy, but I have no faith whatsoever that the camera will keep working for very long.  Very frustrating.  I have always trusted Kodak, but would never again buy a digital camera from them after this.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pink-a-licious", "Author": "V.

I think it's a good deal but wasn't exactly impressed with the quality of the pictures.  They seem lighter on the display, then when downloaded onto the computer seem much darker.  It seems that a flash photo taken at 12 feet away should be a bit lighter than it was, and the colors seem a bit blotchy, but considering what I paid for it I can't complain too much.  It seems to go through batteries and a rechargeable option would be nice (Kodak sells a battery and charger for this) but AAs are easy to find and carrying spares are recommended.", "Date": "December 6, 2008"}, {"Title": "great buy", "Author": "Bullet \"tigers2470\"", "ReviewID": "R1OGXMOIEXW83W", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great buy, the easiest camera I've ever used.

I put two new batteries in it before my vacation this past weekend and they are still good; camera doesn't seem to drain the batteries as much as the older model I had.The digital card is easy downloadable to my computer and I like that as well.Not a bad camera for the price and definately easy to use.***Natalie S.***", "Date": "January 4, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great for a teenager", "Author": "T.
