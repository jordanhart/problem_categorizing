{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Bag with Cheap quality accessories", "Author": "David V.", "ReviewID": "RBA33GOR9PKC7", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Absolutely no issues with the Canon 200EG bag. It is as expected.The accessories bundled with this bag however are not worth your money. Calling it them cheap would be overstating the quality. The tripod was a Precision Design brand and it is so cheap and flimsy, there is no way I would ever put my DSLR on it.  The mount is horrible, cheap plastic and there is zero fluidity in the head movement.  The legs and bracing are thin and weak such that the tripod has little stability.The included \"screen protectors\" were \"universal size\" and had to be cut to size which was a hassle. Even worse was the \"screen protector film\" scratched so bad when using the included cardboard wedge applicator that I immediately removed the plastic protector from my screen.  A piece of packaging tape could have provided the same level of protection.Memory Card wallet- not worthy of even keeping around.The spare battery may the only redeeming aspect of this bundle. However, it is not OEM and given the quality of the other accessories, I'm not holding out much hope that the battery life will be all that great.My advise to you- find the bag elsewhere for around $45 and but the other items separately.", "Date": "January 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great deal, with great quality", "Author": "The ShoX", "ReviewID": "R1CNU98OWAA9AO", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great deal for all new dSLR owners. I bought this mainly for the backpack, but then I found this kit (which was actually cheaper than the backpack by itself).Canon backpack:Genuine Canon product who has a lot of space and great protection. It is very comfortable to have on your back, and with tripod straps, it really makes carrying your dSLR a joy!USB card reader:A great little gadget that saves you a lot of trouble by connecting your whole camera to the computer. It will also extend the life time of your camera's battery by not having to turn it on and off just to transfer your pictureLCD protection:3 pieces of LCD protection that has a \"ruler\" that you can cut out the desired shapes. I have not managed to successfully attaching the protection yet, so I think I will ask someone at our photo store to help me cut out the correct shape, since this is pretty difficult...Memory Card wallet:A memory card wallet with space for up to three memory cardsBattery:A spare battery that really comes in handy when you are going to take a lot of picture and do not have any power outlet nearby.Tripod:I was a bit disappointing over the height of the Tripod, since it was too low for my preferences. But by all means, it is a great tripod for having on tables.Cleaning kit:A nice cleaning kit for the price of the whole backpack kit. You can get a lot better quality cleaning kit, but it does the work.Back up software:I have not tried this, but as all the other products are of great quality, i guess this will be too!", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Amazing deal!", "Author": "M.

I use it as a backup since it doesn't have the smart chip in it....but why pay $100 for a battery??? Tripod was cheap but does the job fine....especially if you didn't have a tripod to begin with.
