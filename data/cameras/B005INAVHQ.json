But all kidding aside, I do think that having what appears to be a security camera in my garage will help keep my house more secure.  I've already been a victim of buglary and was in the market for one of these fake cameras, so I had to scoop one up when I found it on Vine and I think it'll work perfectly with my motion sensor lights.In regards to the actual item, it's a cheap, plastic dome with a flashing red light that mounts to a wall or ceiling via screws, much like a battery-operated tap light (which this essentially is).  And while it feels cheaply made, it looks great, which is what really matters with a device like this.  It's a smooth, clear, plastic dome surrounding what looks like a digital camera lens mounted on a solid plastic base.  Holding it in my hand, I'd know it's fake, but from just a few feet away, I'd honestly think it was a real, working security camera!The \"camera\" takes three AA batteries, which I think is a little excessive for such a low-powered blinking light, and is rated to last 2-3 months according to the instruction manual.  The light is very bright (almost TOO bright) and should be easily seen even during the day.I also like that the camera comes with four little window stickers that say, \"WARNING! SECURITY SYSTEM.\"  It's a nice little touch to help with deterring would-be criminals.The only real problem I have with this product is that there is an empty hole where the \"ON/OFF\" switch should be.  I assumed that it was a leftover from the mold from a real security camera housing, but according to the instruction manual, there is supposed to be a working switch on the base of the unit.  Do I have a defective unit?  I don't hear any plastic rattling around inside and the hole is completely hollow, so it's not a recessed switch.  I want the light on, so I don't really care, and I suppose if you want it off, you can take the batteries out, so it's not a big deal.  Still, this kind of thing makes an already cheap-feeling product feel even cheaper.  Minus one star for that.Ultimately, I would have paid Amazon's asking price for this unit because I think it will do what I want it to: deter potential thieves/vandals.

Nor can one tell if it's \"real\" or no.I have a  friend who worked security at a local business and he stated the cameras there were \"dummy\" cameras, not wired or anything.  Just a wire that went up into the ceiling.  But if you're a bad guy, are you gonna take the chance of being caught on camera?? Chances are you won't.For people getting this, I advise tell NOBODY it's not real.  Install it at a time when people are not around, early in the AM, late afternoon or as dark as you feel comfortable working.  The less people you tell (even your best friends talk to others) and the less people who see you working, the better.ANYTHING that makes a \"bad person\" think twice about during harm to your property is enough to make them move on to something else.

While we waited for the HOA to make a decision on new security measures, I ordered these \"cameras.\" They seemed like a good temporary measure. My wife and I were impressed as soon as we opened the box. Defender makes security cameras and the PH301 looks authentic because it uses the same housing as Defender's working cameras. It installed easily (just screw in the paper guide and insert the screw heads into the slots on the camera). We've had guests over, including an electrical engineer who builds security systems, but none of them realized it was fake. Also, our HOA is now looking into installing cameras because our neighbors noticed the \"upgrades.\" So, these cameras will fool people.However, don't get a false sense of security. Imitation cameras work best as part of a security system. We also installed new locks and an audible alarm, for example. The imitation cameras are most useful when supported by other visible measures that will lend credibility to their deterrent effect and give you another line of defense in case an intruder isn't deterred. For the price, though, they seem to pack a strong deterrent punch because of their very authentic appearance. One thing about the PH301, the flashing LED seems out of place for this type of camera. A few people remarked on that. We took the batteries out. Also, the PH300 seems more intimidating.", "Date": "November 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bit Overwhelmimg To Install!

However, this Defender Imitation Dome Security Camera is so realistic that it is not only a great deterrent, but will bring you great peace of mind for only $10.00. Do these fake cameras work? ABSOLUTELY. At every place I worked, the owners used them. I worked at a Dry Cleaners who had a safe in the back. They had 2 security cameras and never had a robbery. One camera was real that didn't work and the other camera was an imitation. Both were mounted on the ceiling and you couldn't tell the two apart. Only if you held them in your hands could you see which was real and which was fake, as the real cameras are heavy. Another large cosmetic factory where I worked for years had employee problems. Working shoulder to shoulder on production lines all day caused tempers to flair on occasion, and sometimes someone would get their car egged or keyed, so to stop this problem, the company installed security cameras all around the parking lot. Needless to say, we never knew if the cameras were real or fake, but the car keying and egging magically stopped!This Defender Imitation Dome Security Camera looks exactly like the real thing. You could put this side by side with a real one and you would not know which was which on the ceiling. Only close up and in your hand will you feel the heavier real camera. This imitation camera comes with mounting equipment, as it is designed to be mounted on a ceiling and look down. I found it easier to install with string through the battery door and the string taped with heavy packing tape to an inside window frame, rather than drilling holes and screwing it in permanently, for a perfect view of our yard. This imitation camera is super light and can easily be held in place with simple string and tape. The battery compartment holds 3 AA batteries, which are supposed to last 3 months. Also, there is a one year guarantee, which means you can have a great LED flashing deterrent for only $10.00 a year and of course forever if you just use the dome without the flashing LED, should the LED finally fail.Another great thing is this camera can be mounted inside or outdoors. Since the unit is all plastic, it will stay perfect outside no matter what the weather. The flashing red LED light is wonderful- just like the real ones- it says the tape is filming you right now. Also included are 4 window warning stickers- just like the real ones come with, which is a nice touch for added security. Even if you need a real camera, you can also use these fakes for more security in combination with the real ones. No one ever knew at the Dry Cleaners where I worked for years that there was one real camera and one fake one side by side. It's just more added deterrents to help safeguard your property. If you want 24/7 protection- all cameras whether real or fake will always do the job, as after all, what crook is willing to take that chance of being photographed and this $10.00 Defender Imitation Dome will do just that!", "Date": "November 14, 2011"}, {"Title": "No break-ins or graphitti on the truck--must be working?", "Author": "QueenKatieMae", "ReviewID": "R3POZSLHZFPQ6H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We were getting tired of neighborhood taggers leaving their mark on the side of my husband's huge white truck.

In my opinion, the only possible way someone could spot this as a fake is if they are an Amazon.com shopper and familiar with the \"DEFENDER\" logo.Some places I think this would work perfectly:- Front porch- Classrooms- Restaurant/Stores- Apartment complexesOr.. anywhere, really. The design is of the typical commercial camera one might expect to see in a Wal-mart or other type of business, but sticking it above your front porch wouldn't be unbelievable by a long shot.
