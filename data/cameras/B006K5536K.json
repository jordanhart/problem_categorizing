I've been very happy with the DSC-TX10 and I like the new DSC-TX20 a lot. There is no significant changes, the main ones are that the shooter speed is increased to 4 sec (from 2 sec) for night shooting and the new one has video recording in 60i in 1080 AVCHD. Also the panorama option has been boosted since the DSC-TX10's entry, offering solid panoramas of up to 360 degrees. Sony also increased focusing speed. I think these are basically all the differences. Waterproofing and the design hasn't change at all. I red a lot of comments about the waterproofing on the TX10 - both good and bed. I am scuba diver and I've been doing underwater photography for several years now. This camera is not designed for that, it's rated only for 5 meters (16 foot) which I tested in our community pool and it works just fine. Of course you will need to read the instructions and make sure that the seals are properly closed. The camera is great for any pool and for a lot of fun with the kids. Bottom line - it's awesome camera. For it's class I think it's the best on the market for now.

I'm not exactly sure what it does, but it seems to work better underwater with the underwater mode enabled, the auto mode tends to kick the camera into Macro mode underwater.We've taken it snorkeling with us, as well as played in the waves and surf with it and it worked excellently. You can see the screen while snorkeling without too many issues, the camera does have a touchscreen, and it automatically disables the touchscreen while under water. This does mean that you're limited to changing settings while you're above water, but you can start and stop video recording as well as take pictures, zoom, and turn the camera on and off without the touchscreen.The built in panorama mode is pretty great, it reminds me of the panorama mode in iOS 6, works basically the same way, turn your camera vertically and move it smoothly and quickly from one side to the other.The image quality is excellent for what it is, the image sensor is a actual CMOS sensor (albeit still a small one) both \"dry land\" photos and underwater photos turn out great. I normally shoot with a DSLR and good lenses so impressing me with a point-n-shoot has always been difficult.The video quality is excellent as well, I haven't viewed any of it on the HDTV yet but viewing them on the built in LCD they've been great.It also takes standard SD cards as well, which since it's a Sony device is for sure a plus.The waterproof doors that cover the battery/sd card and the HDMI / USB port both have indicators to indicate that they're closed completely, hopefully to help avoid improperly latched doors.The charger is just a USB port on a wall socket, this means that you can charge the camera in the car with a 12V to USB adapter, like the ones used to charge cell phones.Some Drawbacks:As I mentioned earlier, the touchscreen is useless when you're swimming or snorkeling with it, which means adjusting the settings isn't possible during your underwater excursions.The sliding lens cover can get dirt/sand trapped under it, but if you keep aware of it and rinse it out it doesn't seem to cause any issues. Also the instructions recommend rinsing the camera out with fresh water if you use it in salt water.The USB cable isn't a standard micro USB plug, in fact I have no idea what plug it is, I've only seen it once on this camera. That means that if you lose your USB cable, charging the camera isn't going to be possible.Battery life isn't super long, using it for most of the day brought the battery down to the half range. But since you can charge it off of any USB port, we charge it in the car.The camera body its self is made of aluminum and isn't rubberized like most waterproof cameras, this means that the aluminum could get scratched or dented. However this hasn't happened to mine yet.Bottom Line:The bottom line is, that this is an excellent durable camera that is also waterproof! It's a solid investment if you're traveling or in need of something waterproof!", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "And here's why I stick to Sony.", "Author": "Harkanwar Anand", "ReviewID": "R268ZO1KLGQUSG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I don't use SLR cameras because they are too much to carry around and I am a little shy. I need a camera which is better than an SLR and if my ignorance can be ignored i dare say, this camera for what it's worth is better than buying an SLR for your travler, photo enthusiast, keen spirit hippie tree lover. Two years back I tried Canon for digital cameras. They make some amazing ultra compact slick scratch free easy to use cameras and I was immediately a fan. Those cameras would cost around $200 and the battery life was decent enough. My cousin visited me from India and we went to Vegas, Georgia and Orlando and all this while we used his Sony Camera. I was so impressed I decided to buy the Sony TX 10 (previous model of the camera you're reading about) and the relationship was beautiful.When I lost my waterproof TX10, I was very sad because it was easily the best camera I had owned. It's amazing how much money we spend on traveling but seldom do we realize the value of spending $100 more for a camera that will go the extra 20 miles and give you the best output. I paid $320 for mine when I was in Shenzhen, China.Features -a) Image quality in low light is superior without any defacing. More sharp than the TX 10.b) The interface has changed since the previous camera and it took me a few days to get used toc) 16.2 Megapixel camera and videos are shot very welld) nice big led display / touchscreen works goode) Strong Battery - Easily click 300 + images before requiring recharge / plenty of options to view/playback meanwhilef) Slick design though almost no change since TX 10g) 100 % waterproof .. i have tried it a loth) This can take a few shocks and falls tooPros -a) The image itself is superior to any entry level or mid level Canon cameras and the design is also much coolerb) The image capture team seems oddly a fraction of a second longer than the TX 10 sometimes but this also ensures no blurriness whatsoeverc) Super flash. It will make you look good and the objects in the background sustain themselves tood) Easy to put in pockete) Very fast load time and hardly any lag.Cons -a) No extra battery charger and you have to charge by connecting into power socketb) Sony Memory Stick Duo Pro doesn't play on my iMac or Macbook Air / I have to connect usb cable which is a chorec) Interface will take slightly longer to get used to and the button that makes images turn left to make horizontal/vertical is very buggy and ineffective (it's a touchscreen button)d) I have a scratch on this within 20 days. I must have kept it in a pocket with change or pen or something. The screen should be able to take more.I am never buying anything but Sony for cameras. Don't quote me on this but I believe the iPhone 4s uses a Sony/Carl Zeiss lens.I love this camera and I pray I don't lose I lost my last TX 10.***PS - I visited China recently and am uploading a few images, please do check for quality***", "Date": "August 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Big pictures in a small package", "Author": "D.

That is to say, that I use my camera for work in the field of marine accident investigation.  Sure, I have the Nikon D700 and a myriad of lenses and flash units, but to be honest, the camera I pull out most is the DSC TX20.  this is a replacement model for me.  I used the DSC TX10 (I think that is what it was) for a long time.  This camera was, at first a slight disappointment because when I took it out of the box, I realized that the screen was smaller than on my old one.  I had to adjust.  No big deal.  The photos are nothing short of amazing.  I shoot in many dark scenes and enclosed spaces and the flash is so well balanced, I get better results than with the D700.  What I love the most, and relish, is the macro.  This camera gets into small spaces.  I can hold the lens far less than 1/2\" away from the subject and get a tight, high resolution photos that, frankly, blows away my Nikkor 105 macro lens that costs more than 4 times what this camera costs.  Drawbacks: Small and light weight is not always good in a camera.  Steadying the camera becomes a bit of a challenge sometimes as a result.  If you work in a dirty environment, the slide front is subject to getting dirt under the edge and the screen is subject to scratches and smudges.

Sand, mud, dirt, etc. can get in behind the sliding cover, which will cause scratches if you don't clean it properly.  Instructions are provided, and submerging in clean water for 5 minutes effectively cleared the grit.  It is VERY small, which I love for portability, but I can see how it would be cumbersome for folks that are \"all thumbs\".  Photo & video quality are great for such a compact, waterproof camera, and in full auto mode it does a good job with metering and exposure.  Obviously, there are loads of point and shoot cameras that will take better photos, but for me this is a beach/river/back country camera for those times when it isn't practical to bring a better camera.  It has an awesome macro function that lets you get extremely close to your subject, and the auto-pano function works great and is really fun.  I'm still getting used to the idea of carrying a camera with me in my kayak and not obsessing about keeping it in a pelican case the whole time!  I highly recommend a floating camera strap to go with it in case you drop it in the water... it's water proof, not sink proof!  I snagged the chums camera strap and it works great.

Okay, it's a sickness, but I like to make sure I'm buying a solid machine if I can. Surprisingly, other companies that have been making these types of \"Tough\" cameras for much longer--companies like Olympus and Pentax--have pretty lousy track records overall. They cost a bunch, the pictures are soft, the video is SD or mono, and they're just not as tough as they need to be.Which is why I was skeptical about the TX20. It's smaller than those cameras, has more features and doesn't look \"Tough.\" But review after review touted the camera's durability and performance. The stereo video and compact size is what sold me on the camera ultimately. That and the fact that it uses SD cards instead of those awful old memory sticks.So why get a Tough camera? Well, I wanted to get the shots I could never get before. Rainy shots. Underwater video. Pool park photos. There are so many places a Tough camera can go that you wouldn't take another camera. And even though the shots will be softer and less defined than most any other compact camera, a slightly soft shot is better than no shot at all. If you're looking for a \"do-everything\" camera, look elsewhere. I use this camera as a supplement to my serious compact and DSLR. Both of those get far better results, but neither can go underwater (without insanely expensive housings).First shots were impressive. The LCD is bright, which is great considering that it's usually very bright outside in water. Pics look great on the back of the camera--much less so on your monitor at home. The video and the stabilization is terrific for so small a camera. It is hands-down its best feature. That and the panorama stitch.So I took some shots in a pool, at a water park, in puddles. I tried to submerge the camera sparingly. I didn't, for example, place it in my swim trunks and swim around in it. I also never brought the camera down any lower than 2-3 feet in the water--I just didn't want to risk it. Things worked swimmingly for the first 3-4 outings. The flimsy outer door can get sand trapped in it, and you run the risk of scratches if that happens. It also traps water, making it hard to REALLY dry off the camera. And the battery SD card door doesn't inspire oceans of confidence in terms of feeling like there is a strong seal there. But, it seemed to be doing a fine job.So I put the camera on a shelf for 3-4 weeks, and went back to shoot it. The camera powered up, but there was nothing on the LCD--couldn't take a photo or video. After drying the camera out, and re-charging the battery--nothing. So I brought it into my local camera repair shop (it was out of warranty at this point). The camera had gotten water in the battery compartment and they had to disassemble, dry out the parts, replace a couple of fried parts, and re-assemble. $90 later, it was fixed.Now I have a repaired \"Tough\" camera that I have no confidence in. It lasted approximately ONE VACATION. And it's not a cheap camera. It's even more expensive when you sink $90 into a repair. The TX-10 is no different than the TX-20, and go and check THOSE reviews. You'll find lots of similar complaints. Bottom line, this camera is good at nothing else but shooting in and around water. Period. It's not a \"take anywhere\" camera. It's a pool camera. And if it can't do that, it's a paperweight. Sony needs to back up their claims, and review site testers need to put these cameras through far more rigorous testing than they currently do (dropping it in a tumbler of water? Really?). This camera is not tough, it's not durable, it takes the best pics and video of any current Tough Cam, but worse than any other non Tough Cam point and shoot. And it leaks. It leaks, it leaks, it leaks. Wait until someone really tests these tough cams thoroughly before buying. This market still needs work. Until then, buyer beware.", "Date": "April 11, 2013"}, {"Title": "Solid Camera, 3D is hit or miss", "Author": "Rick Myers", "ReviewID": "R16M8TR7OJKQA2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "In short, its a great camera for your basic to enthusiast camera needs. I bought it to replace a TX5, and couldn't be happier with the improvement in function and feel.  It's a definite step up, and worth the money several times over.Now to the 3D.  First, I love 3D.  I have a 27inch 3D monitor and play my games in 3D.  We have a 73 inch 3D TV and up to twice a week it is movie night at our house for up to 8 guests, in full awesome 3D.  I am a 3D enthusiast.  I am *that* market niche.The camera bills itself as able to take breathtaking 3D stills and panoramas, and I will say that 50% of that statement is correct.  When taking 3D stills, you can hear the camera take two pictures.  On a scale of 1 to 10, the best 3D still I took had a \"depth\" value of about 3 (poor).  Most of the time, you really can't see the depth at all.  I tried far away... I tried up close (with a little better result up close)... it just doesn't seem to be worth it.  However...The panoramas are a different matter all together.  These get a solid 8-9 for 3D effect.  By moving the camera to create the panorama effect you get many different angles and perspectives on the scene you are looking at.  When the camera combines all of those images it creates the best 3D I have ever seen.  Better than most 3D movies, and it really did blow me away.When I want to take a 3D photo, I skip the still image photography and just do it as a panorama.  There's another mode which kind of sorta does a still image sized photo, but you take in the 'sweep your camera from left to right', so you end up with a still image aspect photo but taken in a panorama style method (if that makes sense).  Good results, but you get curious looks from people as in \"what the heck are you doing swinging back and forth like that?\"As a pure and simple camera, this camera is much improved over our TX-5, but you would expect that.  From what I have read, other cameras are credited with better pictures overall, but for form, fun factor, features, and price, you really can't go wrong with this camera.I do have one warning for people though.  As shipped, this camera is in a default mode that takes 12 megapixel photos.  You have to find the setting and up the photo to 16.2 MP for the best pictures.  Why they ship this camera in a mode other than its optimal I am not sure, but that may be one of the reasons this camera gets lower marks in overall photo quality than some competitors.", "Date": "July 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Very Happy", "Author": "KTLynn", "ReviewID": "R2C39SOXMIKQ93", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm a college student, so I placed a great deal of thought into my decision for purchasing this camera. I was looking for something cute that could easily fit into my pocket and accompany me on all my water activities in the summer. I also needed it to take fairly good photos in all kinds of light and be user friendly. This camera satisfied all of the above.Water: I go on many float trips in the summertime and like to take photos of all our activities. I took this camera on a three day camping/floating trip almost immediately after purchasing. I was able to get it wet, use it in the water, and snap pics with wet hands- all without worrying. The manual does recommend letting it soak in clean, warm water after use- take this advice! I used it in the river and didn't clean it afterward- resulted in some of my photos I took at night being foggy from the dirty water that remained. The next time, I cleaned it and had no issues.Photo quality/ease of use: My pictures in and out of the water look great! I'm still exploring all the (many) features and specific settings, but so far I love it! There are a lot of settings and options, so if anyone knows a good tutorial on these, please share. I love the many options to scroll through the photos stored on the camera card. The only small issue is something that someone else had mentioned: it is very easy to put your fingers in the way of the camera on the left side. But as long as you are aware of it, I don't think it's a dealbreaker.Touch screen: This was my biggest concern about any camera. I had a Fujifilm touchscreen camera before and absolutely hated it. So naturally, I was apprehensive about purchasing another camera with this feature. I'm glad that I went ahead and gave it a try- the use of this touch screen is much better than my previous experience! The icons are close together- again, there are many options- but they stylus provided is helpful for people with bigger fingers.This camera is much more stylish than other waterproof options out there- it is only slightly larger than my iPhone 4 and easily fits in my pocket. It comes with a wrist strap so it is easy to hold onto- and the stylus snaps right on to the strap cord. One HUGE bonus that no one has really touched on is the charger. It charges the battery inside the camera and the cord hooks up to the charger via USB port, so I can charge it in my car when needed. This was very convenient because the battery life isn't all that strong. I did make it last for two nights of camping and an all day float trip, but I was careful to turn it off when not in use.This was a great purchase- I'm very satisfied.", "Date": "September 12, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sony water proof camera that is not really waterproof! very disappointing", "Author": "L.

I have to say the TX20 is a major upgrade from the TX5, the photo quality is better and the video quality is incredible.  I was always a bit dissapointed with the TX5 due to it's fair picture quality and clunky touch screen but loved every other aspect of the camera.  The TX20 fixes these problems and more.  The touch screen is now capacitive instead of resistive which enables it to be as accurate as a quality smart phone screen and the photo quality is much better.  The photos from the TX20 look more vivid and life-like when compared to the TX5 and the video is much smoother.  It is very fast and responsive in every aspect and is fun to use.  Many fun picture effects to play with too.  As with the TX5 the best part in my opinion is the durability, I like knowing that my camera can come anyplace I want to go.  What good is a camera really if you can't use it anyplace you want?  Another major upgrade in my opinion is this camera's ability to take photos while recording video, I have already found this feature to be extremely useful.  The only negative I can think of is maybe the battery life, however this can be fixed by purchasing the Wasabi brand replacement batteries which last about 1.5X longer in my experience.  Bottom line if you're looking for a compact camera that takes very good photos and stunning quality video and durability is a factor then this is your camera.

Within the first weeks of having the camera, I dropped the camera off of a low table (admittedly my fault), and the camera case cracked in several places. I was flabbergasted that a camera advertised as being shockproof would perform so poorly. (After all, I've had cameras that weren't advertised as being shockproof weather much worse mishaps without incident.)I was able to have the camera repaired under warranty, only to discover after my return from several months abroad, that they returned the camera to me with some of the same cracks still clearly there! So not only was I deprived of the use of my camera during a trip I specifically purchased it for, I returned only to find that it hadn't even been properly repaired! I sent the camera back in again, and this time it came back to me with a properly repaired case.Flash forward a few months, when I discover (before another trip), that the battery compartment has a crack in it! This time the crack is not the result of any precipitating event, and it likely occurred when I merely pressed down on the door to close the compartment. I once again send the camera in for repairs (again deprived of its use during a trip), and it is repaired and sent back to me.I recently sent in the camera for the FOURTH time, for a cracked case, once again on the battery compartment door. This time they claim that the fissure was caused by my dropping the camera, even though the camera is in pristine condition because it has spent more time out of service than in my possession! (Seriously, in addition to the camera constantly being in for repairs, I rarely use the camera, which is why I only notice the problems before trips. I also have a dSLR that I use as my primary camera, so this point and shoot gets very little use--which is what makes this situation even more ridiculous!) If there is a dent on one corner, as they claim (it is still in the possession of their repair department), it is the result of the first incident, which by its very position in the timeline of events, cannot be the cause of this crack. I tried to dispute their finding because I definitely have not dropped the camera since its last repair (or since the first incident), to no avail--they want to charge me more to repair the camera than I paid for the camera new on Amazon!So a word to all those considering this model: it looks pretty now, but you won't think so once the case continuously sprouts new cracks due to no fault on your part, not to mention when Sony tries to charge you an exorbitant fee to repair a defective product. Do a quick google search for \"cracked TX20 case\" and you will see that this is not an isolated incident. I have probably purchased 15 Sony cameras in the past dozen years or so, and this one is likely my last.Oh--and the primary reason I purchased this camera was so that I could use it underwater, but I have never been able to test this feature because it is always out of commission!

Used it in Hawaii in January and used it again in the pool in June of 2013. I only used it twice, and always made sure the camera seals were completely clean before immersion. I've used Canon products underwater before and am familiar with proper care and use of underwater cameras.When I used it in the pool the second time, the seal somehow failed and allowed a little water into the camera. Even though I was not near the maximum depth for the camera, some water got into the camera and it stopped working. Again, prior to immersion, I had checked the seals and ensured that the openings had positively latched.After I sent it into Sony, their customer service center informed that it was not covered by warranty due to corrosion in the camera. Their explanation was that it was \"uneconomical to fix the camera, so the warranty was void.\" To me, this is completely illogical and unfair. Not only could they not tell me how the cameras were tested to see if there was a seal or product failure, two of the four people I was transferred to were somewhat rude. The third, who supposedly worked for the national customer service center, ended up telling me that she was going to transfer me to the tech center that had the unit in hand and were the ones that tested it. She ended up transferring me to the first unit. The final individual was rude and told me he couldn't transfer me to anyone, or back to the original unit. I was told, again, that because there was corrosion in the camera, they would not honor the warranty. They could not seem to understand that the water and corrosion in the camera was because of a product defect.So, I'm out the price of the camera after two uses, including warranty shipping back to the Sony customer service center. I've been a long fan and customer of Sony products, but this has definitely turned me off.

I wanted a waterproof camera to take with me on my Honeymoon (May, 2013) and this camera had all I was looking for.I must be honest and tell you I loved everything about this camera.

I read many reviews on this and other waterproof cameras only to be wary of buying any of them. I narrowed it down to the Nikon Coolpix AW100 and this camera. Some reviews were great but some were really scary. I researched for many weeks trying to make the right decision. We have used the old film camera as well as disposable cameras in the past, but never a digital camera. After much debate and trusting the mass of Amazon reviewers, we chose this camera in pink. I checked all the seals upon arrival and all was good. Bought my Chums float in case I dropped it in the ocean (A MUST have-hate to donate my brand new camera to the fish!). We took this camera on 6 snorkeling excursions and 6 additional days in the pool and this little camera was AWESOME! It has an underwater mode that really brings out the colors of the fish and the water. I took almost 1000 pictures and very few had to be deleted. I was amazed at the clarity and vibrant colors. We did follow the directions (rinsing after each use, inspecting the seals, etc) and have had no problems whatsoever. I am just so thrilled with the snorkeling pictures and the lifelong memories that we can put in the photo book.

I also got it on the great lightening deal this past month at $149. I purchased the Panasonic FZ200 a month ago and took both on a recent trip to Disney World. The TX20 surpassed my expectations. I wanted to be able to capture photos when going on rides (especially the water rides like the rafting and log rides). I found myself using the TX20 90% of the time and eventually the FZ200 remained in the hotel room the last fews days as I hardly used it.The low-light capabilities are awesome. It is amazing how well this camera captures light to produce very good images. I tried to upload some images but something is wrong with Amazon's picture upload feature. The optical and digital zooms are also excellent for this type/size camera. It takes clear and crisp pictures. The macro feature is also great. I've had fun with the modes, picture effects and scene selections. The touch screen is very nice and easy to navigate. Takes great HD video quality even when shooting small details.  I'm very happy with my little sony. The fact it's tiny/pocketable, waterproof, dust/lint free and can take a few knocks is just icing on the cake. I wish I would have had the foresight to purchase 1-2 more to give as gifts at $149.There is a lot of information on the LCD screen on camera or playback mode but it's easy to remove all that by touching the \"DISP ON/OFF\" icon for about 2-3 seconds. It took a little while to figure that one out.One down side is it only takes about 250-280 pictures per battery charge. It's not enough of an inconvenience to remove a star. I just got extra batteries. Something that does annoy me a bit is that in playback/pic review, it takes about 4 seconds for the information to disappear. Once it does, it's gone and you can swipe or tab to the next picture.Overall, I highly recommend this treasure as it exceeded my expectations.Recommendations:Adjust the wrist strap so that it doesn't slide off your hand. I looped a knot in about an inch at one end to where it wouldn't slide off my wrist if it was accidently knocked out of my hand.Get a neoprene case that can hold at least 2 extra batteries. The battery only takes about 250-280 pictures. I'm a shutter bug and take about that many in a day when vacationing. I bought the rooCASE Neoprene Sleeve (Black) Carrying Case for Sony Cyber-shot Digital Camera DSC-TX20 TX66 TX200V WX50 WX70 WX150 W610 W620 W650 W690  which fits the camera and 2 batteries. I highly recommend it. Did the same wrist strap adjustment looping a knot on the strap on the case.Get 2 extra batteries and external charger. You will be glad you did. I purchased the Wasabi Power Battery and Charger Kit for Sony NP-BN1 and Cyber-shot DSC-T99, DSC-T110, DSC-TX5, DSC-TX7, DSC-TX9, DSC-TX10, DSC-TX20, DSC-TX55, DSC-TX66, DSC-TX100V, DSC-TX200V, DSC-W310, DSC-W320, DSC-W330, DSC-W350, DSC-W360, DSC-W380, DSC-W390, DSC-W.... It must be a rapid charger as the batteries charged in about 60 minutes. The batteries last as long as the original Sony brand that came with the camera and I paid less for the kit than I would have for 1 extra Sony battery.I got a 16GB SDHC card but I wish I would have bought the 32GB.

The colors are amazing, the 1080p HD videos are superb and the menu options will not disappoint you. The intelligent auto-mode and the superior auto-mode will determine which kind of scene settings will be more appropriate and change it on it's own. But if you still want to choose the scene regardless of what the camera suggests, you can just go on the menu and have at it.One of the best features, in my opinion, is the panorama shooting scene. Just press and slide the camera from left to right and it is done. Also it is pretty cool that it shoots in 3D, so if you have a 3D TV it is definitely a major plus (I've never tried it myself though).But I urge you to keep in mind it's purpose. This is a quick-shot camera, so my review on it's quality and performance is based on that. We can't expect out pics to have the same quality as those high-techs professional ones. Even tough there are some features that lets you defocus the background, which can give your pics a little touch of professionalism and make it more artistic!Long story short:The PROS are way more numerous than the few, albeit slightly annoying at times, CONS.It is a beautiful camera, easy to handle and program and it is dust/shock/waterproof, which kind of also means that it is beerproof ... need I say more?Buy this camera and go Hakuna Matata you day!", "Date": "September 1, 2012"}, {"Title": "Terrible image quality", "Author": "Tino", "ReviewID": "R1YNHTEK8PXT2A", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I ordered this Sony DSC-TX20 because I was convinced by the nice reviews I was reading from many users.

We had a Canon SD950is that worked great for years but needed to be replaced,  We are big campers so we opted for the TX20 to protect it against moisture or the occasional drop.

It slides easily into the smallest of pockets and despite its small size, my big hands were able to use the touch screen and press the right buttons.- The single button to start and stop movies was helpful and the ability to take pictures while filming a movie was very nice as well.- The movies were pretty darn good!The Bad:- The flash is waaaaay too bright.  It looks like there is a flashlight being shined on the center of our pictures and it looks very odd.- All of our indoor pictures came out blurry in automatic mode.  Yes, there are 50 other modes but you would expect to be able to open and shoot the camera in auto mode indoors during the day in well light spaces like schools.  Nope.  Blurry.- All my action shots were blurry.  I kept cleaning the camera with a lens wipe to ensure it was not dirty.- Spots. I don't know if this is reflective light from the crazy flash but there are orbs of light - like water spots, in many of our pictures.  This is a new camera and has never been used around water.  The camera is less than 5 days old!!!- The screen is already permanently \"smudged\" from being in my pocket.  The case has a tiny ding and we have never dropped it.  This means that just having it in my pocket has damaged the screen and body of the camera.  What good is being shock proof if the camera falls apart.- As with most Sony products, they thought it was a wise move to use a special cable instead of a standard micro USB cable like everyone else in the world.  Now you need to buy new cables.- The camera does not come with a external battery charger. You have to use the special cable and plug it into the special plug they provide.- My old Canon had a wheel with things like sports mode, portrait mode, macro mode...  On the TX20 you need to jump around on the touch screen to get to these modes.  it is very time consuming and inconvenient.We are returning our TX20 and going back to a Canon Powershot despite the fact that it will have inferior movie taking abilities.

Their customer service says it is not.They didn't help me and I need to pay for the repairs, FLAT fee 130USD or more if they find more damage once they have it on their repair department. That is how good companies die.Good luck if you wish to buy one.Sony said that there are not known issues of water damages, go figure about other reviews with the same issue here. :-)The foto quality is not beyond something else in the market.", "Date": "June 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Perfect Camera-Great Price", "Author": "Brooklyn", "ReviewID": "R11MXOWH9Q2RJ3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I had the TX-10 as my first camera a few years ago, I bought it from Sears on sale and didn't know much about it. It was a fantastic camera, I loved everything about it and would not have traded it for any other camera. 2 years later, it was stolen. But for 2 years I did not so much as consider another camera, it stayed in top condition and never failed me. So when I was in the market recently for a new camera, I shopped around through all the new, fancy cameras, and was underwhelmed. I bought and returned a Nikon coolpix s800c and loved the camera aspect, but nothing else, then nearly bought a nice cannon point and shoot, but finally decided to come back to the TX sony series. I couldn't be happier with my decision! They have revamped it from the old model, the underwater feature is wonderful, even if you're not on vacation, having the option to shoot pictures in the rain is nice. It has all the options in the world if you're meticulous about your pictures, and works extremely well for the lazy photographer when its left on auto. The touch screen is great, no problems at all and much easier than buttons. I love that photos are never blurry! I can take pictures from the car or while I'm walking and they turn out great!

Its real appeal to me was its stated sturdiness (waterproof, etc.) since I will use it in some pretty trying environments. I must say that this little camera far exceeded my expectations. It takes crisp pictures, even in low light situations. Its biggest strength is in landscape pictures because it has great wide-angle capabilities which I exploited to the fullest in my travel. The two features that really surprised me were (1) panoramic photo capability, and (2) HD videos. At first I had trouble using the panoramic function because I treated it like my iPhone for which I would sweep slowly from left to right. The Sony camera would keep cutting out on me during the pan shot. Then I realized that the Sony required a fast sweep and the pictures were fantastic! The HD recording was easy to do (just press a dedicated button on the camera on and off) and the quality was excellent. During a recording you can also press the regular shutter to grab a snapshot of the recording which turned out to be quite sharp. This camera's waterproof claim was fully tested when I was at Iguazu Falls in Argentina. I was able to record a great video at Devil's Throat with water splashing all around me. All I had to do was wipe off the little lens area (note this camera does not have an external zooming lens) and the camera was good to go. The metallic-like cover also gives the camera a feeling of durability.I do want to point out the main weakness of this camera -- its lack of much zooming power. The optical zoom is only 4x. Sure you can zoom more with the digital zoom, but the quality drops off drastically so it's really not recommended. I tried to stay within the 4x optical zoom and and got good quality there. Overall, I'd say this is the perfect pocket camera for landscape (wide-angle) or moderate distance photos. It'd be a good portable complement to a decent dSLR.", "Date": "March 8, 2013"}, {"Title": "Works everywhere!", "Author": "Ryan Jones", "ReviewID": "R27C7RGVQLTT8K", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Just finished Tough Mudder (for those that don't know it is a 12 miles obstacle course through mud) and I carried the camera the whole way with no issues.

I took about 200 shots with the flash off, another 75 with the flash on, and then took 10 minutes of video at the highest quality setting before I gave up trying to run the battery out... it still had 1/2 power left according to indicator but even if that was not really accurate (I sometimes find battery meters on devices will plummet quite suddenly) that is an impressive amount of shooting.I also tested the video quality while moving at 70mph, I have uploaded a video to YouTube with the result, you can easily find it by searching for \"MKXios DSC-TX20\"As to testing underwater so far all I have done is test in a local hotel pool, the pictures and underwater video were good, but it's was indoor pool, well lit, in a new/clean hotel so the environment did not have much \"character\" to it to gets shots of.", "Date": "February 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera", "Author": "ROHIT", "ReviewID": "R3JWJYAO2X6MUF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Excellent camera from sony, i love it.Good quality HD pictures , with CMOS lens.Best part is shockproof, it fell twice but still worked perfectly fine.", "Date": "January 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "Fabulous Camera with a TON of Features", "Author": "S.

The build quality seems to be extremely high with a very solid feel to the sliding cover.The pictures it takes are great.  I have to say that I'm not a professional photographer by any stretch so I'm probably not nearly as critical about my pictures as some might be.  That being said, I have no problems with the results I get from this camera in just about any lighting situation.  The plethora of pre-loaded settings and scenes offered by the TX20 mean that I can get the perfect shot every time.  The interface of the included PC software makes loading photos to my laptop extremely quick and easy.Finally, the touchscreen is awesome!

You can't really see the screen on the phone so it's more of a shoot and hope thing underwater but just take lots of pics and you can delete the bad ones. My brother used a camera inside a special waterproof bag specially made for cameras and my pics were twice as clear. Oh yea and taking pics out of the water worked great too. The camera has a sensor that determines what style of pic you are taking (landscape, people, etc) and adjusts accordingly. Plus since it's 16 mp of course the pics look great!

The thing I like most is the small size. It's so light and thin that you can slip it in your front pocket and not even know it's there. Nice for those times when you don't want to lug around a big SLR camera. The photos are surprisingly good, with nice colors and sharp focus. I tried a few shots under water in the pool, and those look great too. Just make sure you change the menu settings to the \"underwater\" mode - that adjusts the color balance so your photos look more natural. The battery has pretty good power too. I shot around 200 images one day, about 1/3 with flash, and still had battery left at the end of the day. If I had one nit to pick, it would be that you have to be careful of your fingers when you are holding it, because of it's small size, Since the entire back of the camera is a touch screen, it's easy to accidentally get into the menu mode, or change settings, if you're not careful. Also, the lens is in the upper left corner, so you have to pay attention to where your finger is when shooting. Certainly not a deal-breaker, just something to be aware of.

Ward", "ReviewID": "R3UDUZINN4RPIM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "We purchased this camera when it went on sale as a \"Gold Box\" deal. My husband and I were leaving the toddler behind, and going on a weekend \"mini vacation\" the next day, so I read a few reviews, was happy with what I read, and had the camera overnighted to us so we could take it with us the next day. We received the camera, my husband charged it, and off we went.The camera charged in a reasonable amount of time. The charger is a USB on one end, which is convenient because you can plug it into car chargers, your computer, or into a wall charger, but the end that plugs into the camera is a special end only used by Sony. This sort of annoyed me, because it meant I would need to have yet another charger to carry around with me. I tend to prefer electronics that can be charged with a micro USB charger like my cell phone, HP Touchpad, and Kindle Fire all do.We first used this camera to take a few test shots of our hotel room. I was impressed with the speed of the camera. It turns on and is ready to take a picture very quickly. It doesn't take long for it to snap a picture, and most of the time, the pictures come out perfectly fine.We used the camera several times on our trip, and overall we were impressed with the pictures it took. We normally use a DSLR, so we are used to very high quality pictures, and obviously a compact camera just can't get the same quality you get from a full-framed camera, but the pictures this camera takes is good enough for capturing memories. The quality does tend to suffer in low-light situations - they can come out very noisy, and it has trouble focusing properly in low light. The quality also suffers when zooming in more than a couple notches - the more you zoom in, the worse the quality gets. This was expected, however, so it wasn't an earth-shattering disappointment.Before I forget, I do also want to note that the camera does not default to the highest resolution picture settings. It is very easy to change, but I didn't realize this until after we had taken a few pictures, so when you get the camera, make sure to change the settings so it's on the highest resolution setting.We also took this camera underwater on our mini vacation trip. It was just in the hotel swimming pool, so there were no amazing underwater scenes to capture to truly determine the underwater quality of this camera, however it took decent enough pictures of my husband and I underwater, and it is a fun little feature to play around with. I expect it'll be great to have once my daughter starts swimming this coming summer.Since our vacation, this camera has gotten more use than I originally expected it to when I first purchased it. It is so much more convenient to have this in my pocket instead of lugging my big DSLR around, so I find I'm taking more pictures of my daughter playing than I was before. They aren't as great quality, but for pictures to upload on Facebook for all the relatives, they are good enough.I've also been using this camera to take pictures of items I'm selling on eBay. I find that it makes it a lot easier to get the pictures than using my bigger camera, and so I'm more inclined to actually bother listing and selling things, whereas it was something I would put off before because I didn't feel like dragging my camera out.Overall, this camera is pretty good for a little point-and-shooter camera. It isn't professional-quality by no means, but for the amateur photographer who wants to take pictures of family, or get some cool shots of underwater scenes, etc. this is a great camera. If you are looking for something to take great pictures in low-light, or to take high-speed pictures of sports, etc., I'd probably not bother investing in this.", "Date": "January 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Rugged but...", "Author": "Tina", "ReviewID": "R92I0AYVSC5S0", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I ordered this camera during the Gold Box Deal of the Day ($164 after taxes).Pros- Many functions and mode choices: underwater shooting, panorama, etc.- Great for beach/water-related outingsCon- Battery seem to drain quickly, especially with underwater function- Processing time of photos creates lag between shots- Focus is sometimes off and create blurred images", "Date": "January 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "it does everything it says on the box", "Author": "edfuh \"ed\"", "ReviewID": "R3QQ4WDY2L87P5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "this was a present for someone and he loved it so I guess it's good.

If top photo quality is your main priority, you're not going to find it here, however.First let me preface the rest of this review by stating that I already owned the previous version of this camera, the TX10, and I'll be mentioning the old camera from time to time in the review.In appearance the TX20 is striking, especially in the orange and gray combination that I have.  One very nice detail is the brick pattern embossed into the sliding lens cover.  The camera very small and will slip into a pocket with ease.  Despite its small size it's very solid feeling, with a metal front.  It has a nice heft in the hand, and the materials are all high quality and well assembled.Using the TX20 is a breeze.  There are only a few buttons on the camera; power, shutter, zoom level, playback mode, and the movie record button.  These buttons are quite tiny, but I had no problem using them with my average sized hands.  The large and high-resolution touch screen manipulates all other camera functions.  The touch screen on the TX20 is very responsive, much better than the TX10.  One huge disappointment is that the screen does not work underwater, so make sure you set the camera up before you get it wet.The TX20 is loaded with features.  There is the automatic mode (which does all of the thinking for you), a plethora of scene modes to choose from, and for those who prefer a little more control there is program mode.  One feature I appreciate is the custom white balance setting.  The sweep panorama is a great feature and works flawlessly about 70% of the time.  For those who don't know, with sweep panorama you simply rotate slowly while the camera shoots photos and stitches them together automatically.  Another useful mode is HDR, this takes three photos in a row and meshes them together so you can capture both the highlights and shadows, and it works well.  Lastly, the lens features an optical image stabilizer to reduce blurry photos and help with shooting in low light.The Sony is a very speedy camera too.  Once you flick down the sliding lens cover, it is ready to go in about 3 seconds.  It focuses in about 1 second and is ready to take the next photo almost instantly.  In continuous shooting mode you can take up to 10 full resolution photos at 10 frames per second, which is a real boon for capturing fast action.So far the Sony has a lot going for it, but where it disappoints is in critical photo quality.  Even at the lowest ISO setting details are a bit soft and some photos look more like a watercolor painting than a photo.  Once the ISO speeds start to raise things get even worse as details are completely obliterated.  On the plus side, even at high ISO speeds colors stay vivid and there is very little noise in the images (since it's all being mushed away), and focus, exposure, and color are excellent most of the time.  I find that prints over 5' x 7' that have a lot of fine details in them look a little soft, but I am very picky.  If you're going to make the majority of your prints smaller than 8' x 10' and aren't as picky about critical image quality than I'm sure you'll like the stylish and fun TX20 just fine.  The lens starts at a very wide 24mm so it's easy to fit everyone in the picture or capture sweeping landscapes.  Additionally, the lens does not soften much in the corners.The Sony's movie mode is excellent.  It records full high definition video with stereo sound and the ability to use the optical zoom.  Moreover, while recording a move, you can take a full resolution still image as well, and it doesn't interrupt the movie.As far as ruggedness is concerned, I used the old TX10 at many water parks and pools and never had any issues with water getting into the camera.  I tried the TX20 in water as well and it didn't give me any trouble.  The doors have nice tight seals.  Additionally the TX10 was dropped a few times on concrete and always survived, and while I'm hoping to never drop the TX20, it's nice to know it can take it in stride.  One note about waterproofing is to make sure all the seals are clean of debris and closed tightly, also make sure that when you\u2019re done in the water that you soak the camera in clean tap water for 10 minutes and press all the buttons to clean out any contaminants.All in all...cameras and water don't usually mix, but the TX20 plays in the water just fine.", "Date": "December 19, 2012"}, {"Title": "Perfect waterproof camera!!", "Author": "Rachel", "ReviewID": "RDOLLMW983SP3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I absolutely love this camera!!

I do a lot of adventure travel and the cameras broke quite easily under less than ideal conditions. Paying $400 for a camera that lasts less than a year is stupid.Much to my surprise, the lower-priced Sony completely put Olympus to shame. The quality, technology and ease of use packed into this little Sony is simply amazing. I would be just as happy at the original retail price...The quick on feature means extremely few missed shots, the low light features are outstanding without having to work your way through cumbersome menus and the easy to use and easy to see touch screen means no more fumbling in the dark to find the right buttons to get to the scene settings. (very few missed shots like I frequently had with the Olympi).The \"intelligent\" auto setting is truly intelligent and I rarely have to use any other settings. The panoramic feature works seamlessly and processes in mere seconds. (Again, unlike the Olympus... panoramas looked like crap and took forever to process).The only funny thing (for me) is I had to go to \"youtube\" where they actually had videos posted of people opening their TX20's upon delivery LOL... to figure out what a little plastic piece was in the box that had no explanation in the instruction book... It's a touch-screen wand that snaps onto the wristband...I recommend that you also buy the external recharger with a spare battery or two, (inexpensive non-proprietary options available), to allow the camera to fully dry out before opening the sealed cover to recharge the battery, and a brightly colored floating wrist strap. BTW: even battery life is better :-)Occasionally I'll accidentally touch something on the screen and have no idea where I am in the advanced menu settings... easy answer... just close the slide cover and reopen and it will bring you back to the mode you were using before in about a second.I grew up 100% loyal to Olympus and never thought I would use another brand (4 decades of only using Olympus). I don't want to sound like I'm dissing them, but their transition from film to digital is lame at best (at least in this category of camera) and I can't believe how much better the Sony is in comparison.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "Disappointed and sending back", "Author": "J D", "ReviewID": "R636Q2EPS9YC1", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Really really wanted to love this camera. It's small, light and looks nice. Feels sturdy too and I like the color. And, it has lots of nice features and of course is water proof. Unfortunately I didn't find the quality to be there with the photos; it's as simple as that.The underwater photos were fine and totally acceptable. And everything else is acceptable...but just not as good and crisp as other small cameras I've had.I do agree with some of the comments that have already been written. Due to the placement of the lens, you get a lot of fingers in photos. I found this happened when I handed my camera to someone else to take a photo and they weren't used to it.The biggest issue is there is no viewfinder and the screen isn't bright enough to use when outside in bright daylight. So I would end up just guessing on the framing, which is not what you want to be doing when you are visiting one of the \"Wonders of the World.\"Also, upon reviewing I found several photos with soft focus. Sure, there could be some \"operator error\" involved, but I've never had a problem with focus before and as someone who works in TV for a living, I'm pretty tech savvy. I think it had to do with what object in the frame the device was focusing on.Overall, while I like the idea of the touchscreen for controls, I found that I missed the more traditional camera controls so I'm returning the camera. If you want something small and cool to take pics for facebook and don't need great quality, it will be fine. If you demand a bit more control and quality I'd search for a different option.

It is a more complex process and viewing requires a Blueray after. The videos can be watched immediately on the PC though. I am still looking into a way to get these converted for TV viewing, but it requires an app to do so, then burning it on a DVD which is then shown using a Blueray.

Last month I started to use it and noticed a crack on the battery entry lit, but didn't mind it. I thought it could have been my fault. This weekend though, I used it and broke alongside the screen, and in the battery lit. This crack was really big, so it is no longer waterproof.In conclusion, in a 3 week period of seldom usage and not dropping it on hard surfaces, the camera is wrecked. This came as a shock since the last one that I had(TX5) withstander much worse situation during a very loooong period.This led me to believe that there might be something wrong with the camera that I received. Not necessarily with the TX20, there might be a chance, since the negative reviews are so few (although, I now noticed, the negative ones relate to this same issue).I would advise to buy a previous model if what you are looking for is a durable and reliable camara.I'm calling SONY to see if there is something to do.

First, the pictures are not as crisp as I would like them and that's probably because they cover the lens to make it waterproof.  Not a big deal if you're using this around water but I wouldn't use this if I wanted to take great pictures.  The other item is that screen is prone to scratches.

Johnson", "ReviewID": "R13T04E2L2R075", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me preface this by explaining this is a two part review, one side about the camera, and the other about sony's customer support.The camera by itself I would only give 3 stars, because while it was amazing, and I loved using it, it did ultimately leak on the 4th day of our trip (right as I got into the water at stingray city, nonetheless! Heartbreaking!). I purchased this camera right before I traveled with a girlfriend to Grand Cayman, after much deliberation, research, and comparisons. The price, and amount of positive reviews won me over (I got the blue one for $179 and $5 s&h...even; the people at sony support were impressed with that deal!).Now, I am not \"camera knowledgeable\" by any means. I get caught up in all the capabilities cameras have over one another when I'm researching (nitpicking shutter speeds, and ISOs, and heaven forbid one camera have any percentage of megapixels over the other, haha) when honestly all I needed was a camera that took decent underwater pictures for snorkeling, and this one fulfilled that purpose perfectly. Even the friend I went with (who had the Panasonic Lumix TS3) was very impressed with some of the photos this little camera took. Only complaint functionality-wise I might've had was the battery tended to die long before I was ready to quit snorkeling. But then again, I wanted to snorkel all day long.Yes, as other reviewers stated, you can't mess with settings while underwater (and it's near impossible to tread water and change settings...believe me, I tried), but in reality it's easy enough to set things up prior to a water excursion, just don't forget to do it. Yes, first world problems to the extreme, I know.I followed others' instructions to a T after every snorkeling adventure: a 10 minute soak in fresh water, followed by a rinse. And everything was perfect...until that 4th day. Sadly, the whole reason Grand Cayman was chosen as our trip of choice was also the downfall of my beautiful little camera. Thankfully, we had the Panasonic for pictures, but that was it for Sony Cyber-shot TX20.Which leads me into the Sony Support...Because I'd bought my camera so close to the trip, it was gratefully still under it's 30-day warranty, and the Sony Support team was awesome. The first lady I talked to recommended purchasing an extended damage warranty (which I did, and was grateful for in the long run, as having that warranty number made things much easier). I will not say the whole process wasn't time consuming and a bit extended (there was a week where I got busy, and didn't return Sony's calls, and the broken camera got sent back to me, but Sony Support emailed me a free Fedex shipping label to send it back, even though it was my negligence!), but all the people I dealt with were awesome and very helpful. I understood the Sony universe did not revolve around me, and was happy to give the information they needed as many times as they needed it, and in return they were happy to help me.My TX20 was damaged beyond repair, and because the TX20 was an outdated model, I received in the mail today, my brand new Sony Cybershot TX30. And still in the beautiful blue color, since I kindly asked the guy if I could get my replacement in the same blue I loved, which he assured me was no problem. It was a lot of phone time, but I really cannot speak enough praise of the Sony team for coming through for me. Five stars to them.In closing, yes, my camera leaked, but I got the newer, pricier version for the cost of a warranty. It really was a cute, functional camera, and our trip was full of strange mishaps (including getting \"stranded\" on the island for 3 extra days), so the drowned camera wasn't the end of the world. I just highly recommend when purchasing this camera, get the extended warranty, just in case.Now, all I need is another GC trip to write my TX30 review!", "Date": "September 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Tough little camera.", "Author": "F.

Of course it wasn't really a test, it was an accident. The camera for a few moment can't focus and as I turn it off and and reboot it, Everything was fine. I didn't have a chance to go underwater yet. I bought a waterproof pouch for extra protection but didn't get to use it.The camera's photos looks great most of the time. I also liked the panoramic feature that you can do both vertical and horizontal. Couple of not so great qualities are short battery life, about 200 shots (more if you don't check out your photos), be sure you have at least a couple of spare batteries. Buy the batteries with a charger. I didn't and have to charge the battery through the camera and it gets annoying. Another complaint is the lack of control, you basically give up your exposure control to the camera and hoped that the camera do it right, and it does most of the time. But nothing is perfect and it does ruin some shots for me.

I dropped it once and the side of the camera opened up, and even though it closed fine and I was able to use it underwater after that, I suspect that the leak occurred through the shell rather than the seals.Also like other reviewers I had significant issues with the camera lens cover opening in my pocket.  This happened more frequently than not so I stopped carrying it in a pocket.  And similarly to others, any use of it on the beach will result in sand getting trapped behind the door and scratching the surface.The smile detection is a cool feature and worked on the few times I tried it.  The panorama works well.  The photo and video quality is good.One very annoying thing I don't see mentioned elsewhere is that Sony uses a very unusual file structure and puts the photos and videos in separate locations, and even puts different formats of videos in different locations.  The result is you're never sure if you've downloaded all your photos & videos.  I find this highly unusual compared to other brands - Canon, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus.When it was working I would have given it 4 stars, but having your camera die after a few months is no good.  I have owned an Olympus waterproof camera for many years without a problem.

Was hoping this one would be as good. The camera itself is pretty much the same. What I think is a step down in design is the way the tx20 charges. You can't pop the battery out and plug it in directly to the outlet charger, which was a small charger that plugged directly into the wall receptacle. SO nice! That was great on the tx5 model, because you could pop out the battery and pop in your second charged battery and continue shooting. Now, with the tx20, the camera is out of commission while the inconvenient short, barely flexible cord has to attach directly to the camera and then the cord and plug to the outlet. On top of that, the fragile door to the waterproof charging port compartment now stays open during charging, gets bumped, the camera rests on the open door because the cord is not very flexible, etc. etc. So, I don't have faith that it will remain waterproof for long.

I get compliments on the picture quality. It's quick to start up / take pics / recover and be ready to take again. The slide down front protects the lens and makes it easy to turn on by flipping down and I haven't noticed any issues with dirt getting in it (rinse after it's in the elements) or it coming loose or anything. I like the options. Touch screen is pretty responsive but sometimes accidentally gets touched and moves screens and doesn't respond when scrolling through pictures. Fingers can get in the way of the lens because of how close to the top/edge it is. Only real complaint is I can't just download and use videos. You have to download their software and publish to sites from there, it's not a normal format you can send or use other than in their program. But the camera is a fantastic little guy.

Universal USB compatibility is a must these days. The gaskets are not heavy duty enough and all the exposed seams and cracks make it easy for little bits of sand to get in them. I thankfully only had one incident where it appeared a tiny bit of moisture got in, but I think for the most part, if you're relatively gentle with it, and make very, very sure that the gaskets are tightly sealed and there's absolutely no debris in the way before you close them, it should be 100% waterproof. Photos get washed out when using the zoom feature. No manual mode but it's a point and shoot, whattya expecting here. Annoying software pops up when you connect to your computer.

In fact, in some ways it is a better design than the latest Cybershot TX model. The images produced will not stand up to a DSLR, but will give you a picture that is far superior to your smartphone. You have limited manual control, but you can always adjust the basics (flash on or off, exposure compensation, white balance), and if you experiment a little with all of the preset scene controls such as 'handheld twilight', 'fast motion', etc. you can get great results. Those scene controls may at first seem like silly gimmicks for someone (such as myself) who also shoots with a DSLR and high quality prime lenses, but with a camera like this you need to embrace the gimmicks to get good results.

I used the camera Saturday afternoon in both a lake and a pool for about 4 hours. I again used the camera on Sunday of the same weekend in the lake. When I got home from the lake the lens was foggy. I opened up the battery compartment (which WAS locked securely) and sure enough there were droplets of water on the battery and memory card. Rather than take a chance and risking it again with a used camera I sent the Camera back to amazon and bought a NEW one from a third party seller (Tri State Camera). The next camera arrived on Wednesday. The camera was the SPANISH version with spanish stickers and a 240V power cord with the round prongs. I saved $15 bucks off the MSRP so I'll live with it... anyway, back to the camera... The DSC-TX20 performed well today on the lake as expected on the first day and I will report back my findings in a few weeks. I have uploaded a video of the unit in action under water. The movie quality is pretty good, as is the picture quality. Be sure to set the camera to MP4 instead of Sony's weird AVC file format otherwise your computer will choke on the video and the interlacing will be horrible (even with VideoLAN blending). The zoom is very good for only being 4x and the digital zoom looks pretty good too. The battery lasts long enough for a boat outing. If the camera holds up this time I would say it a worth the purchase.", "Date": "July 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "awesome!", "Author": "marcus", "ReviewID": "RN13BRPQV4M02", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "great pics under water and out of water i love this camera and when it has a fabric case on i don't have to worry about throwing it in the water or jumping in with it really cool and very awesome first five minutes of using it i put in a bowl of water to test it out great battery too which seems like a big problem when looking to buy a waterproof camera", "Date": "July 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm", "Author": "Jarek Luczak", "ReviewID": "R3297V5ZTEJGSF", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Recommend this Seller wszysto as described and fast shipping.

I am really happy with the camera that i felt compelled to come on here and write a review.Positives:* its waterproof and shock proof.

And the time stamp is something i like for keeping track of what age my kids were when the picture was taken.* the snap down shutter is awesome.  You can quickly turn it on and off to get going.* i owned another cybershot and this tx20 is much faster at taking pictures and processing them quickly so you can get ready to take another shot.  I love this about the camera.  It achieves this best in outdoors and in auto green setting.* it records movies in HDNegatives:* the package can be deceiving as the box itself doesnt say the camera is waterproof anywhere on it until you actually open the package.* the camera is very sensitive when doing movies...it picks up all sounds including the breeze blowing by which can be annoying sometimes.* doesnt come with a wall plug charger for battery itself.  You have to buy it separate.  The only way to charge the camera out of the package is plugging it into a USB which is usually a computer.

Amazing to have AVCHD in a small package like this, and with stereo audio, etc.Picture quality is great in bright or decent light. Not the sharpest pics but sharp enough for casual shooting! Lots of different modes you can play with, from picture effects, to different modes that help make a better looking pic (scene selection, HDR, High res panorama, etc).

This leads to many pictures with a slice of finger across the top. Anytime you ask someone to take your picture you have to tell them to avoid this and it still happens. Also, on a recent trip to Europe I realized later that what you see in the digital display as you're shooting is a significantly larger frame than the actual photo it takes.

I recorded my sons sliding on a 5 foot inflatable water slide into a 5-6\" wading pool at the end. It worked great for this and didn't seem to have any problems in the water. The video looks fantastic and I was really pleased.Next weekend I took them swimming at their grandparents. The pictures looked great and I was able to take some really cool \"flying\" shots of them jumping in. We were in a normal sized pool for about 1 hour. I took the camera out and let it sit for a bit to dry off. When I opened the battery compartment a while later there was moisture inside. The camera still functioned and I was able to let it air dry. I was concerned and hoped it was a fluke.One week later we went swimming again. Same amount of time in the pool and same results. When I opened the battery door there was some very obvious water inside. It has dried out now and the camera still works for now but I don't expect it to be a long term investment.We are going to vacation in a week and will be visiting the hotel pool and theme water park in Florida. I hope the camera survives the trip but I won't be shocked if it doesn't.

So far, during initial testing, the camera seems to function quite well.  There are a ton of options (maybe too many for some) and the camera itself is not as intuitive as I had hoped.  There is no clear explanation of some of the functions and there really is no manual to speak of.  There are a few general instructions and that's about it.  The only issue I've had so far that I really don't like is that the flash is far too bright.  There doesn't seem to be a way to turn it down.  People have mentioned that the flash is quite blinding and the photos do appear a bit washed out.  I'm still practicing getting the pictures to work.

I took it snorkeling and boating, and it took really fabulous pictures. Overall, it was super easy and fun to use (the different settings and picture effects are really cool), and I was thrilled with my purchase... until the fifth day of my vacation, when I decided to give it a charge.I don't know exactly what went wrong, but after charging the camera with the wall outlet, I thought I'd sealed everything up properly before taking it into the ocean again the next day. Unfortunately, it was dead in my hands when I opened the lens cover. It had been working minutes earlier on the path to the beach, so I know it's the water that did it in. When I opened it later to retrieve my SD card (which was fine, so all my pictures were retrievable), there was water in the camera. I think the problem is that I wasn't 100% meticulous in following the cleaning instructions. The instructions say to clean it within 60 minutes of underwater use, and I wasn't always that careful. There must have been some leftover debris or something, a couple grains of sand or salt that got in the gasket when I opened the cover and prevented a proper seal when I closed it again.Fortunately, since it died within a few days of purchase and I got on the return process ASAP, Amazon provided me with a replacement. I haven't tested the new one underwater yet, so my review isn't as fully informed as it could be, but I can say that I am going to follow the cleaning instructions to the letter the next time I use it underwater.

Camera is a really small. Fits nicely in your pocket which is a plus while traveling.2. Takes nice pictures and video3. Feels like a quality made camera. Doesn't feel \"cheap\".4. Takes nice underwater shots and I had no problems with it leaking.5. Battery life seemed really good.Negatives:1. Lense cover can sometimes be hard to slide down.2. Water becomes trapped behind the lense cover so it can take awhile to dry out.3. Sony uses some weird USB cable so if you lose it or forget it you can't charge the camera. Why they don't use a standard micro or mini connector is beyond me. But it is Sony and they are known for this.4. Screen can be a little hard to see in the bright sun.5. I wish the wrist strap was adjustable so you could tighten it so it fit securely on your wrist. This would be a big plus while underwater so it doesn't slip off.Overall, I'm happy with the purchase. It took really nice underwater shots and I actually used it quite a bit around the resort instead of my DSLR Canon.Just a suggestion if you plan on using this camera in salt water. Make sure to rinse it really good with fresh water and let it dry completely before opening it up to charge or take out the memory card.

We wanted a simple small point and shoot because lugging around a full Nikon DSLR was annoying.  The water proof feature is completely untested, but liked it as a \"just in case\" and we did have a camcorder that got shot with a little water at Disney that was never the same after.  Pictures are great thus far, good interface.  The lens being on one side isn't really a big deal, just hold it right and your finger wont be in the shot.  Also because we have kids we wanted a \"fast\" camera.  This one has a feature to rapid shoot, which can take a bunch of pictures a second.  Be aware that after it's done it must process them which can take a few seconds, so don't let go until you get your shot.  Also if the focus point changes when rapid shooting it will have a few out of focus shots.  Great sony image stabilzation, and a real optical zoom with excellent digital \"extension\" which is better than most I have seen.  Takes HD video as well, though I haven't tried to burn a clip to bluray and really see the quality, but it tracks kids well and you can even touch the screen to tell it where to focus, and it will follow a moving object with that focus.Excellent camera to take along and capture those moments with kids.  And a peice of mind knowing that it will survive being dropped, and getting a little water on it.Edit: Just came back from Disney.  Excellent pictures, invaluable rapid shot for catching those priceless moments.  Rarely needed a flash (which would need to be off for rapid shot). Even inside it was able to take great pictures with no flash.  Basically if you can still see with sun glasses on it will probably still be able to take a non grainy picture indoors.  Flash was only needed for really dark rides and the princess dinner in Germany.Also it rained everyday as it does in Florida, and we didn't have to worry about the camera!", "Date": "February 26, 2013"}, {"Title": "love it", "Author": "imsleepingbeauty", "ReviewID": "R2RS3KAQOX4RZA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "works really good . i love it so much. its really worth the price. good to buy it. love it", "Date": "February 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Very good underwaster camera", "Author": "RL", "ReviewID": "R2IZ0ZPP1SBA4Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did weeks of research for a good underwater camera the the Sony DSC-TX20 kept coming up as a top performer,well it was excellent.

Some photos were great, but some of them sucked horribly indoors with anything less than tons of lighting. This little sony however has yet to take a bad picture. No, blurr, red eye, poor colors or anything of the sort. Just great pics. If i had to say there is a weakness, it would be the optical zoom of only 4x. Knowing this ahead of time and knowing the intended use the camera would recieve i am fine with it. It seems durable, but time will tell on that i guess. I was pretty worried about the back being touch screen. I usually pass on anything with a touch screen if it isnt made by apple.

People look more attractive, food looks incredible, and the auto settings are so good and so fast that once I have it out of my pocket I never miss a shot.Furthermore, this thing always fits well into my pocket and looks enough like a \"party camera\" to be great for getting shots at a club. People seem to like the slide down thing a lot.Confirmed that it is waterproof by swimming with it in a pool.All in all, it gets the photos I want and takes them better than I could with my dSLR.

The pictures out of water is decent, but zooming all the way in at something far in the distance (like birds in the top of a tree) is just o.k--not great.  But then, that's not what this camera is really for or why I bought it.  Also, you have to make sure the water droplets are off the lens though or you get a blurry spot.  That's operator error.  I'm learning.  It has a lot of fun features for different types of shots, which I have yet to explore.  I mostly used the smart mode, which did great.  The only part that frustrated me a little is that the screen was a little touchy and the camera is small, so it's very easy to bump the screen and go into a menu without meaning to.

There are so many features and options for this camera, but I can't find any place online that actually describes them. For example, there is a miniature mode - well, I took a picture, it's blurry, but what did it do? Some are a little more obvious, like black and white, color features, etc. but it would be so much more user friendly if it explained all the options. It's a little harder to hold while zooming than any other camera I had, but the touch screen is fabulous for searching through pictures and finding the settings you want for your picture.

In addition, all the accessories are interchangeable between models such as the battery, charger, float strap etc.  I appreciate that the slide cover has a subtle texture.

I had no reservations about letting a 3 year old run around with it recently.  Got some great feet shots!  And also lots of pictures of little fingers as the lens is right where you would normally hold the camera.  Takes some practice to avoid.  The flash on this model tends to wash everything out, so generally I turn the flash off and use low light or back light settings.  As with the TX5, there is some lag time capturing an image in low light.  Of some concern, is the battery compartment door which appears to bow slightly when closed.  It is not completely flush with the body of the camera like the HDMI access door is.  So far it has been waterproof, but I snorkle often and I worry about extended periods in the water.

It's exactly the price that made me jump on it instead of investing in a expensive camera that I'd be afraid to take with me into outdoors where I like to go.  I needed a camera to take photos of every day stuff while I'm out in the woods or around family.  So I need a camera that I can carry with me all the time and not worry about it getting bumped or scratched.I took this thing into the Indiana woods two days after I received; it poured rain for nearly 3 hours.  No problems with rain there or while walking the wet streets of DC.  So far it's done pretty good with the wet stuff.  I did transfer mud to the camera while in the woods, I've yet to get that all out of the little nooks and crannies around buttons.I really like this camera a lot and would recommend it to anyone needing a really nice point and shoot or need one with waterproof & shockproof features.Pros:Small (It's smaller than your cell phone and takes way better pics)Waterproof (Great in the Rain, haven't tried submerging it yet)Quick - From the moment you slide it open to pic number 1 then 2 ..., it's really fast.Various Modes - HDR, 3D, and many othersRemembers Last Setting Used - Once you slide it open, it has your last setting ready.Touch Screen - Really pretty niceBattery - Charges fairly quick, lasts a long time (I've drained it twice in DC after all day shooting; modes like HDR I'm sure require the battery work harder as I think the battery would last longer if I didn't shoot in those modes all the time.)Cons:Slider - I find that it doesn't slide open easy, it's not difficult, but with one had, the smallness of the camera prevents you from sliding it open if it's not positioned properly with you fingers.  Your fingers, if on top, don't assist the downward action of the slider, but rather seem to only be pushing the top of the narrow camera when one handing it.

I own an DSLR so this camera gets limited use. So far I am happy with however there are some negative design aspects that make this a meddle of the road camera at best.The camera was purchased specifically because it was waterproof. The idea was to use it in the boat and to use it in our pool. The first camera lasted about 2 weeks before the seals leaked and water got into it. Amazon was very good replacing the camera however the seals should not have leaked. No problems so far with the replacement however I do have a lot of confidence in the seals lasting a long time,There is no view finder. You must use the display to compose and frame the picture. In the bright sun the display is very difficult to see so composing and framing the picture is almost impossible.The lens is in upper left hand corner of the camera very close to the edge. Due to the position of the lens and when you have it with no zoom (widest angle) it is very easy to get your fingers in the picture if you don't pay attention to how you grip the camera. This normally might not be an issue however it becomes and an issue when you can't see the display and don't have a view finder to frame the picture.The bottom line is, would I buy this camera again after using it a few months.

The full HD videos are excellent and the sound quality is decent. The coolest feature is that it doesn't look like an average waterproof camera with weird obtrusive designs. This allows you to go clim a mountain, swim in a waterfall but right after take it to a dinner party and blend right in.The only minor cons I'd have to point out is that there is not very much optical zoom on it and the touch screen operation doesn't work when your hands get to cold swimming.Definitely worth the money and gets to job done!

Perhaps it was only for ME as a kinda make-up for delivering a couple of packages late or something. I am and was totally happy with Amazon already for delivering packages EARLY in some instances, but this! This takes the cake. Amazon had sometimes delivered in 1 day rather than the 2 days they promised. That was pretty good and all, but their Daily Deals have got to be the greatest things since sliced Meat! 1/2 off on 1000 dollar items or 1/3 price for couple hundred dollar items. I am so going to hate next summer when Amazon will start charging TAX for items sold in Virginia. Amazon is my #2 place to shop right now. 1st is groceries and #2 is for everything else non edible, though I see that they actually sell food stuff as well. Anyways, back to this Camera. I already own a Fujifilm XP waterproof (resistant) camera. I bought it last year to take to Water Country U.S.A. (Bush Garden's Water Park) for taking pictures in the pools etc with my kids. I also own a regular SONY Cyber-Shot and am happy with it. The DSC-TX20 is a higher resolution than the FUJI and has more picture taking features, the same as my other Cyber-SHot. It has the features the FUJI has except the Sony has a Touch Screen and can play Music too. Pretty soon these Cameras will make toast and coffee as well as take pictures. I totally recommend this Camera as a decent purchase if you plan to swim and need pictures in the water. Only buy it on sale though. It's not too cheap at full MSR. WHile I'm at it I want to kiss Amazon's butt again. This is my second year as a Prime member with them. I have definitely made up the price of membership with the savings I received on shipping and as if that  weren't good enough they also have a Movie service akin to Netflix which Prime Members can enjoy with a huge variety of no charge movies.

As disappointed as I was, I didn't think it would be an issue with other people's cameras, as I had done lots of reading of reviews here on Amazon.

One of the cracks is in the EXACT same location as mine!She said she had returned the camera twice for repair for the same issue until the warranty ran out. I called up Sony for repair, but they wouldn't guarantee free repair as it could be \"physical damage\".

Once I got it I started taking pictures like crazy to test it out and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. The colors are almost always vivid, it does a great job in the auto function on focusing (even on moving subjects), and retains a good deal of detail. The auto function will automatically adjust itself depending on what you are shooting - low light, portrait, macro, etc. - and it hasn't failed me yet. I am a somewhat experienced photographer and have a DSLR, but I wanted a good point and shoot for convenience.The only other function I have really messed with is the video, which I was kind of disappointed with as the quality is not great. That is why I took off one star. But for me the video is not that big of a deal because I have a good video camera I can use if I feel like taking good quality video. But this camera would be fine to use on video if need be.To sum it up, this camera is perfect to use for every day picture taking! Easy enough for even the most beginner photographer.

I just purchased this with a 54% discount price so low i couldnt pass up on. Ive seen this camera in bestbuy and its really3x nice. lowprofile and waterproof are the two important features I was after. The shockproof and dustproof features I could use sometime in the future when I deploy overseas again. The touchscreen part makes it really classy. I also got free shipping. NICE!!!UPDATE:Just checked the price and it's back to msrp value. actually just $1 off now.

So I pulled up to his house and got out as I approached the front door some guy comes bursting out and falls on the stoop. He was half naked, covered in blood and delirious I checked to make sure it wasn't my brother before the dude stumbled off down the street. I decided to enter the house even after seeing this mess not knowing what was going on. Inside the house was dark and it smelled of wet dog I creeped around the corner to find a magnum pointed at my temple. It was by brother; as soon as he saw me it was like old times again and he put down the gun and gave me a hug. I felt I had to lighten the mood a little bit so I quickly gave him his present (this camera). He opened it and was pretty impressed with constuction of the camera and how well it focused.  At this point I felt it may have been ok to ask him about what the earlier events were about, but sadly he just said it was work related and I couldnt know the details. We talked and caught up for a long while and as it started getting late so I said I was going to head back out on the road because I was going to visit my mom soon. With that p-dunkle packed up the camera and handed it back to me. He said that in his business you can not have cameras lying around because sometimes something gets captured on them that could get you in trouble. I tried to convince him to keep it anyway, but alas my brother is a workaholic and cannot break the rules for anybody. I will have to return this camera and get something else for him. He said he would like some extra ammo (I think he's a big hunter), but i think I will just by him a gift card for that.", "Date": "December 13, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "Unavailable", "Features": "16.2 megapixels \"Exmor R\" CMOS sensor for superior low-light performance\n4X optical zoom\n3.0-inch LCD\nCertified waterproof, dustproof, and shockproof\nFull HD 1080/60i with dual record of stills and movies", "Name": "Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX20 16.2 MP Exmor R CMOS Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom and 3.0-inch LCD  (Pink) (2012 Model)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/31P21XewJWL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B006K5536K"}}
