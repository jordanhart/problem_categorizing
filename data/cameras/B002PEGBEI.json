Records Movie minutes, filled the memory card over night, it did seem to work well even in low light. What I wanted to do was use the IR feature to start taking single frame pictures when movement was detected. To properly configure it you had to have a device that would accept RCA jacks to be able to access the programable memory system. Very few use RCA jacks these days, a USB connection would have been easier and less expensive. I had to by a converter to take it from RCA to a digital format and then a cable to connect the converter to a monitor. Yes you can just pull the memory card out and plug in to a computer but you still have to be able to program it to do what you want.", "Date": "December 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Idea", "Author": "connie", "ReviewID": "R3I6LBWV5VHTSZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I think everyone should have one of these in there home, We bought this for our elderly parents, who were having issueswhere they live, and this solved the problem, caught in the act .", "Date": "March 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "DaySpy DVR Hidden in Tissue Box", "Author": "P.C. \"P.C.\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZI9ZCZKVEEJ9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm very pleased with this product, it works very well.

It is completely discreet, and the camera cannot be seen through the box (unless you have a hidden camera detector, the one with the flashing red light, which will quickly discover it), but to the naked eye, you will never know its there. Also note, if you actually pick it up, and look closely, you will see it through the tint. But if you don't know its there and are sitting even two feet away from it, you would never suspect there to be a camera inside, or notice it.With that being said, the reason I revised my review to three stars is:A) There is no sound. They should have at least implemented or built in the option, even as an extra purchase...B) It's very low quality in a darker setting...C) It's really not that simple to use. To set it up, you need to connect it to your TV each time, so you can see what you're doing, then use the remote configure a bunch of options, which aren't as simple as \"Yes/No\" \"On/Off\". It seems they went out of their way to complicate it with too many technical options, and even the manual which is extremely vague doesn't help. Mind you that I built my computer from pieces, literally, so it's not my general knowledge of technology that's lacking...Anyway, if you need to catch someone doing something in a covert way, this is the way to go. Much more discreet than those fake \"movement sensors\" with a camera. Put some time and effort into understanding how it works, and it will do the job well as advertised...", "Date": "January 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good unit.", "Author": "Richard Reid", "ReviewID": "R2AIRC5K9DH9VM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Works as described.
