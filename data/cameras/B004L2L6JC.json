{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very decent camera for the money", "Author": "brownie", "ReviewID": "R3B1Y6C9YULQAK", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I currently own an Olympus DSLR (E-410), along with a Olympus SP-550UZ super-zoom camera.  I decided to buy this camera because I wanted a pocket camera with a nice zoom lens that can take decent quality photos and I received an email from Olympus saying I could get $50 off at select retailers.  Disclaimer: I have only had this camera for a couple days thus this review is only based off of a small amount of time of hands on time with this camera.First -- Image quality.  If I compare this to my DSLR; the DSLR will beat this camera and my SP-550UZ hands down.  There really is no comparison.  But if I compare the image quality to other camera within the VR-320's class my opinion would be that this camera easily succeeds the other cameras in terms of image quality.  The color is outstanding; oranges are ORANGE, blacks are BLACK, blues are BLUE, reds are RED, etc...  Detail in the photos is also great.  I don't really know how to describe detail but I will try.  Ex) Took a photo of a person holding a Cheeto.  The person's face, clothes, Cheeto bag, and Cheeto were all extremely crisp and well defined. The photos I took that achieved this image quality was on a moderately cloudy day with plenty of light.  ISO was set at 80 and white balance was on Auto resulting in the camera using an exposure time of 1/1600th of a second and an F-stop of f/3.  Jacked the ISO up and took some pictures at ISO of 400, 800.  Well, I'll just say that you should never use an ISO of 800 or more on this camera unless you have a program to remove all of the noise.  Even at an ISO of 400 there will be plenty of noise to be concerned about.  Also, even if you have a program to remove the noise you will lose most if not all of the sharpness/crispness of the photo.  (Neat Image works pretty well to remove the noise)Second -- Ease of use.  Well, this is purely opinion so I won't elaborate.  Since I own two other Olympus cameras I found the menus to be well thought out and easy to navigate.  Much better than my 4 year old SP-550UZ and my 4 year old E-410.  I really like how when given the option to change the Exposure Compensation and the White Balance it has a real time view of the current setting along with a real time view of the other settings right next to the current setting.  That's just pretty sweet!  Body is very nice and small.  Great pocket camera.Third -- Video quality.  Wow, just wow.  In a bad way.  720p HD video at 30fps.  Sounds pretty cool.  But no, it really isn't on this camera.  As a previous reviewer mentioned; yes, the colors were there.  The quality was atrocious though.  I'm on a college track and field team and we videotape each other usually using my SP-550UZ.  Decided to try this camera due to the 'HD'.  Just downloaded the videos, so much \"noise\" within the video itself.  Not sound noise but just artifacts within the video.  My blues are blue and so on but the quality of the \"video picture\" makes the video basically unusable.  This was on a bright sunny day.  Looks like it was a lower resolution video just unconverted by the camera itself to 720p.  Not good.  But, I bought this camera to take pictures, not video so I will only knock a single star off for this inconvenience.Fourth -- Performance.  Right around 1 second from power button to ready to take a picture.  Nice.  Focus was much better than I expected; thus it was very fast for a point and shoot camera.  Once you start zooming in focus will start to take a little longer but this is understandable.  Zooming is pretty fast.  Really like how you can change the Auto Focus Mode to AF Tracking.  Position it on the subject, press OK, and the camera will do it's best to continually keep the object in focus.  Pretty neat.  Position of the flash = horrible.  That is right where your finger goes so be careful.  Outside in bright sunlight the screen works remarkably well.  Still pretty crisp and vibrant and not too washed out.  Very easy to use outside and achieve great photos, inside will be difficult due to keeping the ISO down.  This is where you would use the flash, which seems to work pretty good resulting in decent pictures.  Image stabilization works, not much to elaborate on here.  Works pretty good taking action shots, wouldn't buy it just to take action shots but it works.And lastly just my 2 cents.  Even knowing these faults I believe that I would buy this camera again, there would be a slight hesitation but I would buy it.  I was looking forward to the HD video but all's that I wanted was a point and shoot pocket camera with a nice zoom lens.  Which the VR-320 fulfills very nicely.  I am a very experienced photographer and always shoot in full manual.  Going from being able to adjust everything to only being able to adjust the ISO, White Balance, and Exposure is not fun but this is a point and shoot camera - period.  Truthfully, it's kind of fun just taking this out and taking a picture that you know will be good!  Hopefully this will help you make a decision as to whether or not you will purchase this camera.  We all have different needs and wants and this camera fit what I needed and mostly of what I wanted.If you have any questions just comment on this review and I will try my best to answer the question completely.", "Date": "May 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great No Frills - Compact Megazoom Camera", "Author": "Reeljuals", "ReviewID": "R2HA9GASO324LJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I currently have a 5 year old Canon Digital Elph and have been looking for a compact megazoom.  My knowledge of camera features and operation is very basic.  I don't know how to use manual controls and am not interested in learning.  My needs are simple - compact, easy to use, at least 12x optical zoom and no frills with decent picture quality that I can point and shoot.  Set up was a breeze and I didn't need the manual.  I've been playing around with it out in the yard and indoors.  The pics look very good to my amateurish eyes. Price is also right.  I wasn't able to find a comparable camera with similar features in this price range. All in all, I'm quite pleased.I finally had a chance to use the video mode.  Using 720P, the colors were very sharp and true in color.  Using video is very simple.  There is a red button on the back of the camera and just pressing it will activate video and pressing a second time will end the video.  If you need to use zoom, it must be enabled prior to depressing the video button.  Once video is activated, zoom is disabled.  Although, not in stereo, sound is very good - and not \"tinny\".  It picked up the chirping birds, my footsteps in the grass, a neighbors dog barking, etc.  I can't comment on action videos as I've not had a chance to use it for that purpose.For the price, this camera is a real deal.9 May edit/clarification:  Optical zoom can be enabled during video recording without sound, i.e., microphone must be turned off.", "Date": "May 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "The Wide Angle Is The Buying Point", "Author": "PatRM \"PatRM\"", "ReviewID": "R3AH8TBHL9X7YH", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is very basic, and does not cost a great deal.  The selling point is the 24mm equivalent lens.  For those of us that have been shooting pictures for 4 or 5 decades, the wide angle lens is one of the most forgotten items in new cameras, and maybe it is because, as one reviewer said, it is basic and I'm not interested in learning anything beyond that (I paraphrase).  A 24mm equivalent which is about 86 degree angle of view will give the user one more option for creativity.  At the price, I would buy this camera if it only had that lens and nothing else.  As far as the review stating that the higher ISO rating (800, I think) is bad, it usually is for most digital cameras, and when that rating was applied to film, it didn't produce great results either.  I'm rating this camera at 5 stars because I believe the rating should be tempered to the product.  One cannot expect miracles at that price.  When this camera is used as a camera, and used with a low ISO rating, which I do most all the time, it produces excellent results.  Olympus does not put out, as one reviewer stated, pardon my language, CRAP.  They also stand behind their products, and always have.", "Date": "July 13, 2011"}, {"Title": "Surprisingly good camera for the money", "Author": "Barry Brown", "ReviewID": "R25P1UUFBFSA0Y", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought one of the Olympus VR-320 silver cameras to try it out at my niece's Upward Football game today, and I am more than pleased with the results. It is very easy to use (which is great for a point and shoot camera - I don't really want to have to take a lot of time fooling with one when I just want to take a quick shot) and the menu is laid out nicely. The time it takes to turn on and to be able to use is very fast, too, as well as when I want to take a shot of anybody in motion - the camera is very responsive and takes shots quickly (another reason I wanted a camera to keep up with my niece running and moving!).The pictures come out sharp and with great color, and the 720p video is a bonus with nice sound.

Push the red button to begin filming...push it again to stop. Creates awesome/tack sharp/true color .AVIs. I'm a convert! Did I mention the zoom range. I'm a retired Architectural Photographer from the 4X5-Medium Format-Generation. So, I'm WIDE ANGLE. This Bad Boy sports what feels like a 20 mm wide angle (on 35mm Camera). Then, reaches out to 400 35mm equivalent  SHARP AS A TACK-NO BIFRINGING and this is HANDHELD-imagine if I had used a tripod. It's got whats called dual image stabilization I think . It works. The filters are pretty cool (I like the Fisheye at Car Shows) Like all Point and Shoots, there is no viewfinder so composing in bright light kinda sucks. I just might make myself a viewfinder shade for about One penny (a paper Coffee Cup with the bottom cut out) because this is one sweet/powerful/COMPACT super zoom with HD Video for basically Chump Change.

As an owner of several Olympus products, I was drawn to it by brand name, and also the feature set (primarily the 12.5x zoom lens, with an equivalent to 24mm in 35mm camera lens at the widest).  The price was very reasonable, and the camera seems well made.  This Olympus uses SD memory cards, which is a big plus from the xD cards of not so long ago.  Writing and buffering images, and also deleting bloopers is much faster with the SD format.  My computer can download the images from an SD card much more quickly than the xD also.  Start-up times, lag between zooming, etc. in performance terms to my mind seems no worse than my other models, and to some of them the -320 is faster.  Image quality; at first my images appeared somewhat dull using applications already on my system, so I was adjusting contrast primarily.  Today (slightly embarrased..)I finally used the software which came with the camera; downloading and viewing the card with this program the previously mentioned images now appear much sharper and vibrant.  Little to complain about now.  I'm pleased with this camera now, and would recommend that people give it a try.  Helpful hints for most folks; leave the camera on the default settings and use the iAuto mode.  For most uses, this is fine.  I've not tried the Panoramic feature, but the art filters and scene modes as in the Olympus models are interesting (I enjoy the pin hole camera effect most).  There is very little manual control with this model, so if you want features such as Manual, Shutter and Aperture Priority settings you will need to shop for an advanced model.  For a handy walkabout camera, this is a very good choice.  I had no problems adjusting to the menu layout and feature selections (using the thumb toggle and menu buttons).Slight quibble; you must charge the battery via USB cable to a computer if you do not have the correct charger for the battery (which I fortunately did).  Battery life unless you review and playback a lot, or use a lot of flash is okay for an outing though.I gave this camera a 3 star rating on Dpreview, but am bumping that upwards here thanks to the better performance with the Olympus software.", "Date": "December 10, 2011"}, {"Title": "Inconsistent results with my VR-320", "Author": "mandopickr \"mandopickr\"", "ReviewID": "R3TRMX45W817DJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this VR-320 to replace a Nikon Coopix L24. The L24 gave me some great shots, but I was looking for a travel camera with a longer telephoto lense. Somehow I envisioned this camera as a longer lensed L24. I was wrong.First, it is a nice compact size. It seems to be well made, and fairly light. It will fit easily in my front pocket.Start up is quick, and it writes fast to the memory card as well (I use a Class 10 card).The menu is easy to follow, and the lcd screen does reasonably well in daylight.I don't use, nor do I plan to use the video function.As for photo quality, the best thing I can say is its disappointing. I have had this camera for over 60 days, and have worked to find a way to correct some of the photo issues, without success. I should have returned it in the first 30 days, but I kept thinking it was some issue I was missing in the operation of the camera. Often the images are blurry. You can take two or three shots that all blur, then you'll get a couple that are fine.As for flash, it is very inconsistent. I have taken three photos all of the same fixed subject, and had three different exposures. All were bad, with the flash highlighting different areas each time, but never an even exposure.(This was from about 6').Low light photos are not very good, and one would normally use the flash to improve the exposure, except the flash doesn't help.The best shots I have gotten have been outside with plenty of sunlight at iso 100.I have taken this camera to several events where I didn't get one acceptable shot. This last week I have taken test shots in various scene modes, iAuto, and manual mode. I haven't been pleased with any.The best shots I have gotten have been with plenty of sunlight at iso 100.Maybe I got a bad camera, but I cannot figure what area would be bad, the sensor, the vr, just don't know. This I do know though,I am tired of taking this camera with me and having nothing to show for it. With the holidays upon us, I plan to purchase a new point and shoot tomorrow, and later sell this camera for whatever I can get on ebay.My background: Art major which included photography, including several prize winning photos. I currently use both slrs and dslrs, but like having a point and shoot with me for those unexpected photos (and while traveling).", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Inexpensive Versatile Digital Camera", "Author": "raybot1", "ReviewID": "R38FP9YI7907OC", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera after looking at it in a store. I had recently dropped my Canon Powershot ELPH 300 and totaled it due to the lens being extended, so I needed another camera. I initially saw it for the same price as the Canon but after looking around found it here much less expensive. I considered it and decided to go with the Olympus VR-320 due to the high zoom features and image stabilization. After experimenting with the settings which are very varied for a point and shoot, I found my colors sharp and clear. You choose the correct setting with the help of image review and can shoot all your scenes perfectly. To be honest you have to change the settings for each type of environment. Whether it's the ISO, type of light or exposure compensation your pictures will come out right. The camera is able to shoot very clearly even at high zoom. Something I have not seen with other point and shoots. The Canon had one feature that I particularly liked and that is you could zoom in and out while you shoot video. But the Olympus has greater range, settings and impressive zoom. This camera has a solid feel to it as it is constructed of a all metal body, very professional looking and a lens equal to some SLR cameras. The battery life is great and you can shoot all day on one charge. As with most cameras in this range you can shoot on auto and let the camera select each variable or once you get used to it select your own for your particular tastes. At this price you are getting a professional point and shoot rivaling more expensive cameras.

Macro shots were uniformly excellent, though.After a few months of use, it now will no longer focus dependably at any length in any light, so it is basically unusable.

I bought this camera for my wife this year and I must agree with some of the other reviewers who find it makes messy images sometimes. It seems to need a lot of light and several tries to deliver the sharpest images it can deliver, which can be good, but other times it makes pictures with grainy darks and almost a \"paint-filter effect\" on other surfaces and edges. I was considering returning the camera, but it turns out my wife loves it. The lack of critical sharpness that most of us search for is not apparent on the screen unless you really zoom in, which she doesn't do, and she rarely prints an image, so the pictures look fine for her purposes. The color is great and the exposure is fine. Using the camera is a joy, quick startup, large viewscreen, and easy controls that are large enough to use without reading glasses.

I don't know what Olympus is doing on the crowed point-and-shot long zoom camera market, this stuff is basically other makers' 2009 model, just a little higher pixels. It's re-cooking the left over dishes. It does work for those who really are tech-challenged since it is very simple to use and there is not much adjustment buttons or menus to be fooled around with. You just turn the power on and start shooting, and when power is lower, you don't take the battery out but you connect the power cable to the bottom of the camera for charging.I have owned five pocket sized cameras now. The reason of getting this is I want a very light weight and small long zoom camera and some newer models are getting heavier and bigger. But this one I don't think I will keep since it does not stand out on any ground. I don't like to return stuff if not for quality issue itself so I may give this one as a gift to some family member. For this price, or if you want to add about 20 ~ 30 bucks more, you can get Sony HX5v, last years' model but with the same size with a lot more features, better HD video, and GPS. I think in the past 3 years the best small point-and-shot pocket size camera is Fuji Finepix F-70EXR which is a 2009 model. For these cameras newer model don't necessarily get better. I really don't feel more than 10 MP on the point-and-shot camera is that useful since the photo quality from these cameras really don't improve with more pixels, it just takes up more memory cards' space. Better pictures will have to be taken by SLR cameras, if you want to carry those heavy bags with you. I have one but hate to carry it around so I do like a good pocket sized long zoom.Pros:Long zoom, wide angel (24), small size, light weight, simple to use (not for those who wants more menus), date can be printed on the photos taken.Cons:Just an old model be remade in order to sell with a higher price; so-so photo quality, no real HD video, no zooming with video on.", "Date": "July 5, 2011"}, {"Title": "Bad Quality", "Author": "Gabrielle", "ReviewID": "R6B0WKPI25SD1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera is terrible.

When I turned the flash off, the colors came out right, but the slightest instability in my hand blurred the picture and it wouldn't focus well. In no way can this camera take action shots. The panorama is confusing to use. I found the instruction manual difficult to understand or make sense of. I tried swithcing through all of the options to take a picture and no matter what I did, all of the pictures appeared the same to me.

PLEASE READ before you buy!!", "Author": "Its Not Important \"Private\"", "ReviewID": "RZDU421EQ27H7", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I will start by saying that I am an amateur photog who often gets a lot of compliments on my photos on Flickr and other sites because of the angles, shot selections, etc. For many years, I used a Minolta DiMage, which captured AMAZING scenic shots that required little editing. I don't know if the standards are just very low these days or what, but it was very frustrating when I tried to find another camera to match the quality of photos of the Minolta earlier this year. I tried them all in the $150-250 range - Canon, Nikon, Sony, and yes, Olympus. But they all required significant editing and time in Photoshop and Picasa in order to make the pictures even baseline decent for anything more than sharing on Facebook or your phone. Eventually, I will upgrade to a D-SLR but I guess Minolta spoiled me into believing that you CAN get a quality picture without dropping a mortgage payment.PRO'S: I did not find this camera too hard to set up, though it has some quirks with confirming settings. I HATE the 'magic' scenes because it's very difficult to figure out how to turn that nonsense off for folks who like semi-raw shots. Also, I do like the separate video button, and the zoom has its appeal (though not for long). The video is decent, though I didn't buy this camera to shoot movies, I bought it to take decent PICTURES.CON'S: I don't have the time to go into all the CON'S of this camera - I will just say that I now understand why Staples sold it to me on sale and strictly enforced the 14-day final sale policy (with a disposable product like this, who can blame them!!) First, the picture quality is TERRIBLE. I haven't taken a single shot with this camera that did not require extensive editing in Photoshop and/or Picasa. It's almost like shooting a sketch!! While there isn't a lot of graininess, the pictures are almost water-color in nature. I'm not a nervous person so mind you, I'm not confusing picture sharpness with operator movement. No, this is something inherent in the design. Next, while this camera has an impressive zoom on the surface, it takes FOREVER to stabilize. No matter how steady your hands are, it shakes when trying to zoom in, requiring me at this point to literally shoot SEVERAL shots of the same picture so that I can select one when I view them at the end (I've learned from painful experience that this is NOT a camera that you can rely on for single-picture quality shots). Whether you use the pre-set modes or use their semi-raw modes, it's very difficult to get true colors or exposure, again, without extensive editing. I've played with the pre-sets and set the ISO levels on my own from previous photog experience, but nothing seems to work with this thing. The panoramic mode is \"interesting\", and that's NOT a good thing. I STILL haven't figured out how to use it (though it was straightforward on other brands like Sony).Best use: work-related pictures (e.g. shooting real estate, cars, etc - anything that doesn't have a lot of personal value to you!)All in all, there's no way I'd recommend this thing to anyone, in fact, I'm looking for a way to now sell it on ebay and buy another.

Since I don't always want to carry my DSLR (also an Olympus, E-620) I can now keep a hi-resolution camera, with HD video in my pocket at all times.The lens is excellent, with very little distortion at the wide-angle end. Being a long-time Oly owner (this is my seventh, and fourth digital) I already know how the exposure system thinks. Color accuracy is excellent, and there are plenty of options in Program mode to change white balance, metering mode, and focus. I love that the shutter speed and F/stop is shown on the monitor so I can make adjustments to ISO or exposure compensation before I shoot. It isn't manual mode, but it is the next best thing. At 14 MP there is plenty of latitude for cropping.Among the scene modes and art-photo settings is one I find very useful, and it isn't on my DSLR: this camera can generate a black on white line drawing and save the original photo at he same time! The panorama mode offers a feature that makes panorama stitching with the Olympus software exceptionally smooth. A narrow box appears on the scree, which you can place on any of the four edges to determine shooting direction. After exposure, the image from that box appears on the opposite edge as a transparent overlay, allowing precise alignment for the next shot.At less than $90, I am delighted, and the blue color, with a purple ring around the lens is very snappy.

It has two macro ranges, one standard and one fixed focus one that will allow me to take very detailed photos of small parts. The specs could have been a bit more detailed about this feature. The 12.5:1 zoom range is great for going from wide angle to a really good telephoto view. It did not come with any memory card and one is really needed as the built in memory is only good for about 7 (from the specs) to 10 (my observation) full resolution photos at a time.  Again, the specs could have been more specific. But I knew I needed a card anyway so I was not disappointed. The viewfinder is a full 3\" diagonal and is readily visible outside.

If you can't keep your hand[s] perfectly still, you ARE NOT going to get ANY clear photos.

Over a dozen videos of Five Finger Death Punch, Trivium, and Pop Evil, all COMPLETELY unwatchable, because the audio is THAT bad.I'm going to demand my money back from Woot and then I'm going to sell this thing to anyone dumb enough to take it off my hands.
