I have been snapping and printing shots for the past few days and it has been very easy, even for a technological nivice such as myself. The camera is small, good looking, and lightweight (7oz!). I Paid $300 before accessories, resonable for 3 megapixels. The camera basically comes with everything one would need, but for those who take a lot of shots, a larger memory card (16mb included with camera) would be necessary. I looked at many other brands. Canons were a little bit overpriced, Sonys looked good, but the accessories end up costing more than the camera. If your first time digital enthusiast like me, go for the A303, you won't be sorry!", "Date": "May 4, 2003"}, {"Title": "Fuji FinePix A303 Review", "Author": "Han S.

My first was an Olympus, second an Fuji 2800. Listen very carefully. Each of the above digital cameras have (some) things I like better than the new Fuji A303. For example the Olympus has a far better optical zoom, but I go through batteries like food through a duck (it's awful), my Fuji 2800 has a SLR feel to it, very nice camera, but the if you choose not to use the LCD viewer, you viewing through a lens simulation, but it's really a LCD, a feature that is really a non feature. The movie feature actually has sound (a plus). My new Fuji (tired of waiting?) is powerful 3.24 m/p, nice 3X optical zoom. Here is the best part of this camera, IT'S SMALL, and easy to use. This is particularly important to women who have the smaller designer purses, this will actually fit. It's the size of a cigarette package. For most of us this Fuji has more features you will ever use. For me I set it on A (automatic)setting. You will love the use of the setting wheel, this saves you time, for example if you need a close-up, macro just turn the wheel one click, no menus to scroll down (I love it). Regarding the media card, this is smaller, looks like th older smartmedia, just smaller. Since I have three Digital cameras, I purchased a duel card reader, it reads the larger smart media, and the (new) very compact XD card. I just figured the small card is just more practical for the smaller cameras. The camera is also very handsome. The color LCD on the back is 1.5\" and is very nice, If you like to look through a view finder (I do), you look through a lens viewer. A compact camera, 3.24 M/Pixel, and all the features. Save yourself time & money buy the A303, and thank me later, really.", "Date": "March 11, 2003"}, {"Title": "Dynamite little package- but not without its problems", "Author": "Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"", "ReviewID": "RTEHJY3Y664F5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Buying a digital camera these days seems to be about as easy as using a spoon to empty Lake Superior. It's a daunting task to say the least, simply because there are so many different manufacturers out there and each makes several cameras. Worse, there are some companies that shouldn't be making digital cameras because the products are so lousy (Polaroid springs to mind). I myself looked at several cameras under five-hundred dollars and above two-hundred dollars as a starting point. I also had criteria including things like I didn't care whether it could capture video. All I wanted was a camera that took pictures and could then transfer those images to my PC. Once I started this process, narrowing down what camera I wanted became a little easier.There aren't many digital cameras out there that can take pictures as well as a half decent 35mm SLR, at least not yet. Some make a very good attempt at it, but, and this is an important but, you're buying the convenience of not having to spend money developing rolls and rolls of film. Another criteria I looked at was storage medium- Compact Flash cards, Sony's proprietary memory sticks or the new XD cards. After examining the different media types, I found I didn't care which one my future camera took. How many of these things are you gonna need, anyway? Between the 16 mb card that came with the camera and the 64 mb card I bought with it, I can store about 250-300 high quality images. That's a lot of pictures and considering you can review and the delete the ones you don't like, freeing up extra space. So unless you're taking a 3-month tour of Europe, it is unlikely that you will run out of memory to store pictures.Initially I had settled on the Sony DSCP7 3.2 mega-pixel camera, but at the last minute jumped ship and purchased the FijiFilm FinePix A303- another smaller 3.2 mega pixel camera and haven't really regretted doing so. It's a wonderful little (about 3 x 2 x 1 inches) silver box that takes good quality images. It has everything I wanted- 6x total zoom, USB port for connecting to my PC, built in flash, built in timer, and red eye reduction. And like anything, it also had to be easy to use, because taking pictures shouldn't be work, but a part of the fun. The A303 can also take video without sound, but that doesn't matter to me since I also own a video camera and if I'm camping on traveling around, I carry both in the same bag.Having owned it for a little over a month, I have found only two irritating functions. First, it eats batteries like there's no tomorrow. In day light, with the view screen turned off and no flash, you might be able to fill a 64 mb card before the batteries die, but if you use the flash and/or screen, forget it- you'll be changing batteries before you know it. The second thing it does and this is the killer because I lost pictures because of it, is if you scroll through images using the review function and don't go all the way to the end, you will overwrite images in memory when you start taking new pictures. I found this out the hard when on a canoe trip when I discovered that several pictures of a white tailed deer drinking from the river side were overwritten by later photos of friends around the camp fire. The first failing is forgivable- alkaline and rechargeable batteries are cheap, but replacing pictures like those are not. It's going to cost the camera a star. Some reviewers have also complained about its plastic construction- okay, so it's made of plastic- what isn't these days?That aside, though, I am very happy with the A303- it does exactly what I want: takes good pictures quickly and easily that I can send to my family and friends. It's economical considering I don't have to pay to develop pictures or even wait to have them developed. It's small and easy to carry and now that I know about the overwriting foible, it won't happen again because I'll know better. For what it costs and for what you get, it's a great value, fun and easy to use. I don't regret buying and the pictures I've taken have made some people very happy.", "Date": "June 2, 2003"}, {"Title": "Fuji delivers a lot for digital photo amateurs for the price", "Author": "Joanna Daneman", "ReviewID": "R2O9O204V09C9T", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have had several digital cameras, and none gave me better service than the Fuji FinePix. Normally, I do film photography and if I want digital pictures, I scan in the negative. When I went to straight digital photography, I found out that I needed certain features as \"must-haves.\" The Fuji did pretty well on most counts.Photos: Resolution\u00b7 2048 x 1536 - on the fine setting\u00b7 1600 x 1200  -on the normal setting (fine for most work)\u00b7 1280 x 960 or 640 x 480 Lower resolution email setting for smaller files (nice!)Features\u00b7 JPEG format.\u00b7  Up to 60 seconds of 320 x 240 or up to 240 sec's of 160 x 120 motion video\u00b7 3X optical zoom Pros:\u00b7 Great resolution for the price. Fuji delivers sharper pictures than many entry-level competitors.\u00b7 Choice of settings including that email setting, great if you are taking a bunch of pictures and want to email them without a lot of massaging\u00b7 Exposure compensation for backlight available (+1.5 to -.2.1 EV exposure value)\u00b7 White balance choice to change exposure from automatic, good if no manual settings are available, as they are not here.\u00b7 Controls are EASY to use. I love that directional button for playback and settings.\u00b7 XD Picture card-new standard for digital-supposed to reduce battery consumption and faster read/write, as well as large capacity.Cons\u00b7 Relies on AA batteries, leaving you to have to shell out for  a NiMH rechargeable instead, recommended so you don't leave a nasty pile of eco-unfriendly batteries behind you as you go on a photo shoot. And recharging IS more convenient, believe me.\u00b7 You may be concerned about moving to a new digital format (the XD) or have a stash of standard Smart Memory cards. It's annoying to move to a new standard, though XD offers some advantages. Conclusion: You can't go wrong here for an entry-level digital camera. This delivers plenty of performance for the buck and most people will be more than pleased. Just get a rechargeable battery.

The interface is very simple to use, and it takes good pictures and makes decent movies for a digital camera.I'm writing this mainly in response to another review.  The only concern I had in buying this camera was that one reviewer here said that if you scroll through the images on the camera, stop in the middle, and then take pictures, it will overwrite the images that you've already taken.  I talked to a friend of mine who also has a Fuji digital camera (although not this model), and he said it didn't happen with his, so I decided to buy the A303.

Now and then, for work, I've shot with a number of 35mm, a couple large format film cameras, one pro-35mm digital, and one digital large format studio system.  That's for work though. The little Fuji A303 is for fun and what simple fun it proved to be. The camera belongs to my 12 year old nephew. It's so simple that a youngster has no trouble getting shots that are every bit as good as the ones I take! Carrying it around all day, taking indoor and outdoor shots, close-ups and scenics, this little camera never flinched. I never had to override any of the automatic exposure settings. It handled backlighting with ease (my subject was in front of a very bright window with southern exposure). I couldn't make it fail. Exposures were brilliant. These images look great printed out, and they are super for use in web sites, email, etc. I'd even use them in a small brochure if shot at the highest setting.

It looks cheap and feels cheap plastic. Cover of lens although good looking in pictures, is very flimsy. Try playing with one in a store and you will realize what I mean. Its basically a very thin sheet held by a spring, sure to break soon.2. Too thick/big to compete with Canon Elph's.3. Very less weight means more camera shake and blurry pictures. Yes for a digital camera being too light is also problematic.4. Picture quality only average for a 3MP. Nothing spectacular. Don't be guided by just a \"3MP\" tag... doesn't necesaarily mean better quality. (Just like having fastest processor on your PC doesn't mean best performance, other things like motherboard, chispet, memory etc also count)5. Has max shutter of only 1/2 sec, meaning you won't get any decent night or low light pictures.6. No Video out port for watching pics on TV.7. No sound recorded with movies. Movies have too low frame rate and useless quality. Use as a webcam also isn't practical.8. Lens worse than even other Fuji, 2650.9. To make things worse, it uses a propreitary xD card which is *more than twice* as expensive as CF card here on Amazon. Plus there's no 128MB in stock anywhere as of today. Death to xD card !Why wouldn't someone buy a Canon A40/S200/S330 or Fuji 2650 or Nikon 2500 or Minolta Dimage X or one of dozens of Kodak/Sony/HP models floating around ? Why A303 with new propreitary card and no features for the price except a 3MP tag ?

It is good for stationary subjects such as landscape, plants, and overweight cats.  If you expect to need to take action shots or several shots in a row, it is not the camera for you.  The shudder speed is too slow for moving targets and it can take 5-7 seconds between pictures when using the flash.My personal opinion rates is at 4-stars, though I could not rationally give it more than 3 due to its age and the afore-mentioned drawbacks.", "Date": "July 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "Tolerable", "Author": "May Li \"Herro and Bai Bai\"", "ReviewID": "R2N3QOL2AT8ZX3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good:1. 3 megapixels for high quality photos2. lightweight3. fast response time, a good camera for point and shoot.4. can record pretty high quality videos5. both optical and digital zoom6. very nice white balance (especially indoors)7. only needs 2 AA batteries.Bad:1. blurs easily indoors without proper/bright lighting. Outdoor pictures are great though, and I'm a firm anti-flash type person,  however it seems like the only way to get rid of blurriness is to use flash.2. bulky. It's light yes, but it's also bulky, meaning you can't really carry it conveniently wherever you want; you basically have to carry it in its own case, which is rather annoying on vacations and outtings with friends and well....travelling anywhere.3. videos don't have sound, but I don't really think that's a downer...my little short silent ones are totally fine, although sound would be a pleasant extra to have...Overall, this camera is pretty good. I think it's a nice deal for the low price. However, the fat and plump case/design made me supremely jealous of my friend's credit card-sized camera that she can fit in the back pocket of her jeans.

As one of the least expensive 3 megapixel cameras at the time (the output is 2048x1536 pixels), it sold fairly quickly.  It seemed nice at first, with the large image size for the price, but I became disappointed with image quality after a while.  The sensor is only capable of ISO 100 speeds, so it would insist on using the flash in most situations that didn't have the benefit of broad daylight.  Even in broad daylight, the images would still be quite grainy at larger sizes, and there was a good chance of bright background colors bleeding around the edges of darker foreground objects.  So, in addition to not handling dark scenes very well, it also had trouble with bright ones.  Unfortunately, it's a struggle to see the preview/playback screen when outdoors.  I got frustrated with it fairly quickly, though some of the deficiencies can be fixed in post-processing, and many images look just fine if you display them at 1/4 resolution (1024x768).I liked the fairly small size, as it fits nicely into a shirt pocket.  It's also easy to retrieve photos from the camera, since it simply shows up as a USB hard drive if you have it in the correct mode.  Unfortunately, the battery life seemed fairly short for a camera of this size.  I used it with a 128 MB xD card, and was able to put right around 100 full-size photos on it.  Unfortunately, it seemed to suck batteries dry pretty quickly, so 100 photos on a single charge is about as far as I'd want to go.", "Date": "January 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good for birthdays and trips to the zoo.", "Author": "M.
