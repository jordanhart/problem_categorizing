I really wanted the D5100 but couldn't afford it.  It has all of the basic features I wanted but is missing the additional resolution of the D5100, 14.2 Meg vs 16.2 meg, and the adjustable screen which is OK.  The most important thing to me is that it uses all of my lenses and attachments I had for the D60 and uses them as well or better than the D60.  It's a very nice camera.It takes very nice HD video.  It is limited to 10 minutes but when you think about it thats a pretty long video.I'm glad I bought it!", "Date": "September 18, 2011"}, {"Title": "D3100 is missing some features I loved about the D5000....", "Author": "LJH", "ReviewID": "R18IS0DF2L32OU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I already own a Nikon D5000 and ordered the D3100 because of it's lower light capability and better HD video capability.  HOWEVER, I was disappointed that some of the features I loved about the D5000 have been omitted with the D3100.  The D3100 has no \"scene\" mode - ideal settings for beach, snow, autumn leaves, pets, etc.  This mode was replaced with a \"guide\" mode... not needed if you refer to the manual and if you are familiar with the camera.Also, regarding my order, Cameta Camera stated that the camera, (body only), \"includes ALL original camera accessories (the Nikon USA Warranty Card, Batteries, Cords, Instruction Manuals, etc.)\" but NO cords were shipped with the camera.  I will contact Cameta Camera about this.", "Date": "November 29, 2010"}, {"Title": "A Powerful, Small and Light Weight Camera", "Author": "Kimball Corson", "ReviewID": "R2SNV127SLH7G6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I agree with the reviewer who indicates the features lacking on this camera, including the warranty card from Calumet; however, those features are not ones I care about, want or use anyway (except the warranty card), especially the folly of video in a still camera. What I wanted was exactly what I got: the new Expeed 2 image processing engine found in the top end Nikon D3S and D7000 cameras, a new 14.2 MP CMOS (not a CCD), a very small size and a very light weight, without being flimsy or junky.My complaint on professional gear and I have some is that it is too big and too heavy and it scares small children and others in the Third World. However, I want the high end picture making capabilities and muscle of the top professional gear in a light weight and small walk around camera and lens. That is what the D3100 is all about, plus, for the body only, it is still tremendous bang for the buck, especially when then used with a super standard zoom lens like the Nikon 16-85mm (forget the 18-200mm with its problems which I have also reviewed here).", "Date": "December 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "Satisfied", "Author": "Tushar Shah", "ReviewID": "R3B7T5HFIC36SL", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got around to writing review after more than a year since buying this camera. It meets my needs perfectly because I was looking for light-weight camera that gives good results indoors and has low shutter-lag. Indoor photos don't washout the subjects with excessive flash allowing natural skin tones to show. Shutter lag is low enough for capturing fleeting smiles. Size and bulk is small enough to hang on the neck or carry in a backpack.Most of my pictures are taken in Auto-mode but I love the results. Only once I fiddled around with manual focus, ISO and Aperture settings for 4th of July fireworks. Pictures I got were magazine-worthy.Battery life is long enough for over 400 shots, 16GB card is sufficient for lasting over couple of trips. I use Picasa for organizing photos and Sony's PMB for importing.I skipped buying the kit from Costco because I know I would not carry around two different lenses, let alone switch them. Instead I bought 18mm-105mm lens and thank my good judgment every time I use my camera. Lens is good enough for wide angles and perfect for portraits. Bokeh effect is as expected (can never get that from even high-end aim-and-shoots). I have taken shots of rainbows, closeups of kids, super close-ups of flowers, city-life, dance performances, beaches, sunsets and whatever else I fancy.I have never felt buyer's remorse for owning this. I just thought it is worth the expense to capture priceless memories of my kids before they grow up. I only wish D3100 had adjustable LCD like D5100's for taking ground-level photos or other unusual angles.", "Date": "October 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "great versatility!", "Author": "happy photographer", "ReviewID": "R1VDMIBCVXZ3TL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am incredibly happy with this camera!  First off, the ability to buy just the camera body was very helpful, as it saved me about $50 on the kit 18-55mm lens, which I was able to put towards a 18-105mm lens.  The camera itself works really well in a number of conditions.  It has a really high max ISO, so you can shoot inside without flash and with high enough shutter speeds to prevent blur.  Outside I was able to capture some great shots of sports games, where the \"series\" option and high shutter speed proved very helpful.  If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive digital SLR camera, and are willing to drop a couple more bucks for a better lens/already have other Nikon lenses you can use, this is the perfect choice.", "Date": "November 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "Great Pics and Video with old Nikkor manual film lenses.", "Author": "Book Reader \"bob_spez\"", "ReviewID": "R2OVQGC7W6B5U3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have wanted a DSLR for years. Every time I hear the word Nikon, I hear Paul Simon's 50 year old lyrics playing loud and clear in my head... \"I've got a Nikon camera, I love to take photographs, Mama don't take my Kodachrome away.\"I have a Panasonic Lumix LX5 that I bought on Amazon about a year ago that takes great pics and videos in auto or manual mode. Recently I have been experimenting with setting f stops and exposure and ISO settings in manual mode on the Lumix. I found I could get even better pics with manual settings than just using the auto settings. I started to desire a bigger sensor and more megapixels, to get even better pics, but wasn't comfortable spending many hundreds or thousands on a new DSLR and quality lenses.On ebay I just bought a used Nikon D3100 body and four used Nikkor manual film lenses for less than 400 dollars total. To take pics or videos, I set the f stop on the lens, set the exposure on the D3100, keep the ISO on 100, turn the manual focus ring on the lens, and shoot amazing videos and still pics outdoors, or indoors in room light with no flash.In the used market, many 30 to 40 year old Nikkor film lenses are selling for 10% of what they cost new. These are designated Non-AI or Pre-AI lenses, and they worked with Nikon film cameras. They are solid lenses and perform incredibly well with the D3100 in manual mode, for stills and video, thanks to the magnify (+) and (-)  buttons on the left side of the D3100 lcd screen.  When setting up a still shot or a video with the lcd screen in live view, using the magnify buttons digitally magnifies a portion of the screen up to 6.8 X, so I can focus perfectly by turning the focus ring on the lens until the magnified image on the lcd screen is sharp. I can't read a pill bottle, even with my glasses on, but this magnify button blows up a portion of the image so I can focus perfectly with the lens focus ring. And the screen also shows the exposure time and iso settings. The f stop is set with a ring on the lens itself.The DX sensor on the 3100D increases the 35mm equivalent of lenses by 1.5. My Nikkor film lenses and 35mm equivalents are:Nikon Nikkor-Q Auto 200mm f/4.0 1:4 Manual Focus Telephoto Lens (35mm equivalent of 300mm).Nikon Zoom-Nikkor 43-86mm f3.5 Non-AI (35 mm equivalent of 64.5-129mm).Nikon Nikkor-H Auto 28mm 1:3.5 Manual Focus Prime Lens (35mm equivalent 42mm).Nikon F 50mm f/1.4 Nikkor S Non-AI Film Camera Prime Manual SLR Lens (35mm equivalent of 75mm).", "Date": "October 24, 2013"}, {"Title": "Is Amazon aware of what Nikon calls \"Gray Market\"", "Author": "Nestor J.
