{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Professional PTZ Camera", "Author": "Audio Visual Integrator \"LDCrewe\"", "ReviewID": "R3B1XDNLBWP33C", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just couldn't let this camera go with a three star rating because one guy receive a unit not working.I am a professional AV systems installer and have installed two of these cameras thus far. Works first time out of the box and has a great picture quality. The camera comes with all the accessories necessary for mounting right side up or inverted (has an image inverter switch). It also comes with dip switches underneath which are not necessary to use in most cases. The camera comes with an IR remote control unit that will allow you to select one of four camera to assign operations for all PTZ functions. I hope that I'll have the time later to update this review; but for now I just wanted to let the possible purchaser realize that this is a good product.", "Date": "November 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good camera", "Author": "J. Hager \"Big Man\"", "ReviewID": "RLN0QAG33LHWM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Good camera, had great picture for video conference, after setting up camera though and testing more thoroughly, found that panning to the left caused the camera to reset itself.  I hadn't seen any other reports of this issue, so assume it was isolated and not a bad batch thing.  Had to return for replacement/refund.  Like the remote for the camera also.  Connected using s-video for PC feed.  I would buy again.", "Date": "May 16, 2011"}, {"Title": "DOA", "Author": "20165", "ReviewID": "R241OYMI3AXD1Z", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Now working when arrived.
