And while I wouldn't have chosen the Kodak CX7330 for myself, my wife bought it for me to replace our old 3-megapixel Konica, and it's quite a capable little machine. Despite extensive photography experience for over 20 years, I'm surprised how much more I use it because I don't have to make so many decisions about the pictures I take.The CX7330 takes great snapshots, just don't expect much manual control over them. Whether this is the camera for you depends on whether you want that control (in which case you should pick another model), or just want to take decent photos (in which case this one is quite good).The camera body is not especially small and all plastic, but (other than the memory card door) feels solid and is comfortable to hold. The controls are very straightforward: choose one of five photo modes, or one movie mode, then press a button to shoot. Since the camera has a good lens and intelligent electronics, the results are generally very good, with much better auto-white balance than on many other comparable cameras. For novices or those who don't have or don't want to use a computer to process their photos, the Share button and available dock and printer could be handy, though they're not for me.Low-light performance without a flash isn't so great. There is no way to force long exposures, the camera lacks an auto-focus assist lamp like Canon models have, and the lens is a bit slow. Startup and shot-to-shot times are decent, but not all that fast, and fairly typical of this class of camera. Battery life, using either NiMH rechargeables or the included lithium expendables, is fabulous, the best I've ever seen from a digicam using just two AA batteries -- and a huge improvement over many other battery-eating models.The only control you have over the camera is to choose the shooting mode, set how the flash behaves (auto, forced on, forced off, or red-eye reduction), decide on a resolution (you have no control over how much compression the camera uses, just photo size), and set the self-timer or nice 3-shot burst mode if you want. You can adjust the exposure compensation to take longer or shorter exposures, but there's no way to set the shutter speed, focus, or f-stop directly.One useful option is a 3-megapixel 3:2 ratio size, which makes shots that fit on the longer 4x6\" prints from most photo stores, without needing to be cropped. The movie mode (if you're into that) is quite good for this sort of camera: 320x240 pixels with sound, 15 frames per second, with no limit on time other than the size and speed of your memory card. There is also a neat onscreen display of little \"brackets\" showing where the camera is focusing, though there is no way to change that other than to recompose your photo.A few other quirks: Other than the image size, most other parameters (like flash mode) reset themselves when you turn the camera off and on. You can choose either to use the internal 16 MB memory OR an SD/MMC memory card (if present), but not both, i.e. there's no easy way to use an external card until it fills up, then switch to the internal memory automatically. You must make the switch using a menu, or remove your memory card. Finally, while the optical (lens-moving) zoom works all the time, the digital zoom (always a misomer; it's really \"in-camera cropping\") only operates if you have the LCD screen turned on.So this is not a camera for serious pro or \"prosumer\" photography, but for carrying around all the time as a family snapshot camera, or as a backup when you just need to get the picture, it does the job well. And for the price, it's quite a deal.", "Date": "August 23, 2004"}, {"Title": "This is great camera for a little price.", "Author": "M. R. WONG", "ReviewID": "R2FPXWSXWJ3ESI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My girlfriend has this camera.  The software CD works well with both Windows 2000 and Windows XP.  Don't understand why the other reviewer say that it's not compatible.  Even if there is this problem, one can always goto [...] and download the latest software.Uploading pictures is easy.  Connect the USB cable that comes with the camera to the computer, then turn on the camera, the Kodak software automatically detects the photo transfer in a few seconds.  Then, you just press \"transfer all\", it transfers all pictures right away.Emailing picture is easy.  Press email button, enter \"from\" your email address; enter \"to\" destination email address, then choose the pictures from right side and click \"send\".  That's it!  It is so simple.  Of course, be sure you are online when you do this.The picture quality is pretty good, better than a comparable SONY, which is even costier.  I myself use the DX7440, which is a higher-end Kodak 4.0MP with full TV-quality movie mode.  We upload pictures to Ofoto.com and print 4\"X6\", 8\"X10\" pictures.  The colors are true, natural and not over-satuated.I compare the photos taken from this to my DX7440, there is no difference for 4\"X6\" at least.  My DX7440 does take photos in dark better since there are manual features for that purpose and the DX7440 is more expensive.The movie mode is a nice extra since sometimes you really want to take some short movies and capture the moments you like to capture in motion.I have two Kodak digital cameras and my girlfriends and some of our friends all use Kodak digital cameras.  As long as it is manufactured after 1/1/2004, the cameras are fine since there is the extra of new Kodak color-science enhancement for the new cameras manufactured in 2004.The Zoom len also works great.  Taking close shots requires pressing a close-shot button otherwise it won't focus properly, just have to remember that.This camera also works well with Kodak printer dock, the prints are laminated, and it makes the photos free from moisture attack and finger prints.  Nice!In conclusion, this is one great camera.  Yet, for those who like to take better night shots and more movie features, get the LS743 or DX7440 or CX7530 or CX7430.

Maybe users who need a whole lot of features or manual controls wouldn't be happy with it, but the pictures I've taken so far have been excellent.This camera is also very easy to use--nice, simple zoom feature that gets good closeups without having to be right in someone's face.  I agree with other reviewers that the door where you insert the memory card seems VERY fragile, but otherwise it's pretty sturdy and compact.I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a better array of features and such good crisp pictures in other cameras in this price range.

I even downloaded a picture and emailed it to an online store to print the picture on a purse and T shirt for a gift.BUT, be patient with the printing off the dock.  It's slow and the printer cartridge lasts for 40 pics and that's it.  You only have one choice of paper and cartridge pack so don't buy all the other fancy papers because the printer cartridge is only sold as a package that includes 40 sheets of Kodak paper for $25.The camera didn't come with a carrying case and you definetly need one so the camera doesn;t get scratched, etc.  I bought one at a retailer for $10.Then I had to buy a memory card otherwise the camera itself only hold 10 pictures.  I think with the memory card (that slips into the side of the camera) I get about 100 pics.  That was about $40.  I also got that at a retailer.One more thing...don't count on your retailer to have the Kodak assessories readily available.  I originally went to Best Buy and Frys and they were out of the things I needed.

It has so many features that come in higher priced cameras, the bang for the buck is what counts for me.  Cons I don't like the USB under the flemsy plastic flap.

This was the one I bought because the other model I wanted was not available where I bought it.  The only downside to this camera is, like many have said, is when you turn it off it resets your chosen flash settings.  The initial battery does not last long at all, but I recommend a pack of Energizer E2 batteries as they have quite a long life, or the rechargeable batteries Kodak recommends.  It also has an auto-shutoff feature to conserve batteries.  This camera is great for taking basic pictures.  I enjoy taking pictures of scenic views and using them as a screen saver, or just family and friends photos then creating an online album to share with everyone.  Pictures do print nicely as well, depending on the printer and paper (especially when using the Kodak printer dock).  I have occasionally had blurry pictures, but I'm not sure if that is the camera or my nerves.  It does have a sport setting for objects in motion, so when not taking scenery pictures, I use that a lot.  I definitely recommend this camera to anyone who likes to take pictures but has a smaller budget.EDIT:  After about four years, at least two of which did not include as much picture taking as the first year, I finally had to buy a new camera.  This Kodak started giving me trouble by either refusing to turn on or by shutting itself off at random (was not the batteries, because I replaced them multiple times).

While the colors in pictures are not as vibrant as those taken with the Kodak, the Canon has a faster shutter speed and I have far less blurry pictures since technology had greatly improved over those four years.

Other cameras use a separate mechanism internally to hold the battery in place and create mechanically strong contact. The outer cover in those designs is cosmetic. As small pieces of the cover break off the battery compartment door will continue to close, but will not properly lock in place and will not produce enough pressure to make electrical contact. The result is that camera operates intermittently.I bought 2 of these cameras for my teenage girls. Both cameras had to be returned (one of them twice) within a few months of purchase because the plastic battery compartment door broke. While they were replaced by Kodak, the replacements had the same problem. In less than a year after purchase both camera's were permanently out of service.Overall a waste of money.", "Date": "August 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Decent buy for the money", "Author": "Colleen", "ReviewID": "R25T8YZ8YUY32W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have had this camera for a year and a half now and I have to say, it is a good little camera.

First is the length of time it takes this camera to get ready to shoot from an \"off\" position.  Second, there is a considerable shutter lag, even when you've done the requisite prefocusing which can be a problem if you plan to shoot subjects \"in action\".

The first one...can't even remember the brand... just quit working. Other than that I was very happy with it. A major difference between the two was that the other camera used a lithium battery and I gave it the \"brand new baby\" test. I had it over a year and never did replace the batteries and I can't even estimate how many photos I took. This Easyshare was given to me for Christmas and I replaced the AA batteries twice by the end of Christmas day. Fortunately rechargeable batteries have solved that problem. Other than that, not bad cameras until you learn how to work with digital photos. Now I understand that it isn't normal for the viewing screen to be too dark to see the photo subject. Even when the light was pretty moderate, if I zoomed in I could not see the photo. I have to take test pictures to see how they came out. Even then I often don't get the picture centered. My oldest daughter who is quite technology savvy, told me that I should be able to adjust the contrast to correct the problem. Neither of us was able to find a way to fix it. There is a lot of red eye but can be solved with the edit features available on most photo viewing software. Of course I'd have a lot more time on my hands if I just didn't have the red eye in the first place. I didn't like the camera software. It was a royal pain in the rear. It had a photo tutorial that always loaded at start up. Every time, every day. Unless of course it froze up and messed up my whole computer until I had to restart the computer. Even customer support couldn't help me make it stop. I only had peace after restoring my computer and using Adobe Photo Shop to download my pictures.

It also has a video option.-It's not incredibly small, but it'll fit in your pocket.-If you turn the live view off (where you see the image on the screen before taking the photo), the battery life is pretty good (just don't take many videos). A few days ago, I took about 60 pictures and about 10 videos that were about 20 seconds each.Cons:-It can't take pictures in the dark. Or, for that matter, anything without a big, visible light source. When in auto mode, the pictures become waay to dark and undefined, but the shutter speed for the night mode is ridiculously long, so no matter how still your subject/hand is, it'll be too blurry.-The batteries fall out easily. Twice during concerts, I've lost batteries because I rubbed against the bottom of the camera.-The zoom isn't terrific. In fact, it doesn't really 'zoom in' at all; the closest you can get on any mode except for close-up is the same as you'd see through your naked eye. But that's where the close-up feature comes in handy. (It's only if you want great detail on objects near you, such as flowers; any further and it's just a big blur)-Without a tripod and a still subject, it's hard to get clear photos on the night and close-up mode.You can get decent photos with this camera under the right conditions, but this is just a simple camera for unprofessional images. Probably good if you're on a family vacation to Disneyland, or on an outing with friends. In broad daylight, that is. It's not necessarily a bad camera, but it was insufficient for my needs.
