Griffith", "ReviewID": "R35325EUZ8AJW9", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My review of the Leica X-VARIOI have only had the camera a few weeks (about 600 shots) now and my opinion on some aspects may change once I have more time with the camera.Initial Impression On AnnouncementMy initial impression on Leica's announcement was very negative.  I thought it would be too heavy, too slow (AF), and too slow a lens and I felt it was over priced for what it had to offer.  In general, I have always been impressed with Leica glass but not so impressed with their ability in electronics and in particular in firmware development.  It seems to me that they were and still are way too slow to address issues that were either missed or in the rush to get a product shipping, they decided to ignore for a future date fix.  A really big negative was the lack of a built in view finder.Nonetheless, I decided to purchase the camera and see how it performed in the real world.  I had read Sean Reid's, Jonathan Slack's, and Steve Huff's reviews and several others.  Consistently, among all of the reviews was the theme that the lens quality was excellent, perhaps approaching that of prime lenses.  Secondly, was build quality that felt solid in the hand and like a quality built product.  Lastly, image IQ was also rated as excellent.  I owned an X100s that I sold just prior to buying the X-VARIO and I also owned a Sony RX-1 that I sold earlier.Given this background you are probably wondering why I purchased the X-VARIO.  The reasons are as follows:First, I wanted a zoom lens covering wide angle to portraiture.  My preference would have been 24mm to 120mm with an f2 to f4.5 that was high enough quality to rate a 26-30 on DXO mark's lens review.  While this lens lacks the range and I don't know how well it will rate, my guess is that it will perform very well based on my observations.  Most kit lenses perform at the 11-12 rating and that just isn't good enough.  The Sony RX-1 Zeiss lens rated a 33, which is really outstanding, but it is a prime lens fixed at 35mm.  My choices would have been to carry three excellent primes or an excellent zoom.  I really dislike carrying anything extra so my preference was to find an excellent zoom and live with its limitations.  The only other choice would have been the 18-55mm zoom for the Fuji XE-1 with the XE-1.  I gave it serious consideration as the lens is very highly rated and it has a built in EVF.I decided against the Fuji, primarily because of the MF and AF.  It is probably as fast as the X-VARIO but my experience with the X100s led me to question how frequently it would misbehave unexpectedly causing me to lose too many shots and the MF using focus peaking or magnification is just a very poor implementation of fly-by-wire, even the new improved implementation.  It doesn't feel like a MF lens and there are no stops.  The magnified view does not snap into focus making it difficult to tell when optimum focus has been found.The third factor was build quality.  I wanted at least RX-1 build quality and the X-VARIO appeared to have that and maybe more.Lastly, I considered how the implementation of the overall ergonomics felt to me.  This is a subjective judgment based on things like ease of use of menus, button placement, speed of operation, focus and zoom action, etc.The bottom line was that I decided to take the plunge and give the X-VARIO a try.  In the worst case, I would send the camera back or sell it at what I hoped would be a small loss.So how does the X-VARIO stack up and compare?Build Quality appears to be excellent.  Knobs turn with positive and firm clicks, buttons feel solid and provide tactile feedback, the lens focus ring operates smoothly and with just the right amount of resistance.  The Zoom ring is equally responsive and smooth and the size of each makes them easy to use.  The body feels solid and the top and bottom plates also feel well made.  The battery door and the door to the cable connectors have a solid and high quality feel.  The skin provides a nice feel with some grip so it doesn't feel slippery.  For comparison, the RX-1 feels very close to the same quality but the focus ring is not as nice and the battery and cable connector coverings aren't as nice either.  The Fuji X100s does not match this quality and is a clear step or two down in the quality scale.  The lens is super sharp throughout the zoom and aperture range.There is a pop and micro contrast that the X_VARIO offers in its images that makes it the equal or slightly better as far as IQ goes compared to the RX-1 and considerably better than the Fuji X100s.  Where the Fuji and the RX-1 exceed the X_VARIO is when ISO goes above 1600.  While the images are perfectly usable at 3200 and sometimes 6400, they aren't as clean as the X100s or the RX-1.  The grain is fine and if you want to give up some detail, you can smooth it out in LR and have a perfectly usable image.Where the X-VARIO falls ShortThe biggest disappointment is in the auto focus.  While it is about the same as the RX-1, it is still slower than it should be, especially compared to the Panasonic and Olympus cameras.  Given that Leica had to know after the X-1 and the X-2 how important this would be (their literature touts its fast AF they failed to meet their advertising hype.  Whether this can be improved in a subsequent firmware update remains to be seen, especially given how long it takes Leica to get out firmware updates.  Small software development teams should be able to perform more quickly than big teams in big companies.  Usually, this is an area where small companies have the advantage.  Its low light AF varies from sometimes working pretty well to not being able to find focus at all.  I was out shooting at night on the streets of Newport RI and shooting in bars, etc. where ISO 6400 was required to keep to 1/30 sec exposure and AF, while slow worked well with only a few miss focused shots.  Other times in similar conditions I have seen the camera unable to find focus.  I have no idea why the difference.  In very bright light conditions it can be reasonably quick, but not quick enough indoors to shoot moving children.  AF accuracy is another area that needs to be addressed.  On more than a few occasions I have seen the green confirmation box lit to indicate that AF was acquired and locked only to discover on later review that the image was not focused.  Surprisingly, point AF seems to be the worst culprit of the various AF modes.If there were only one thing I could get fixed on a firmware release it would be to improve the performance of the AF system both in speed and accuracy.Auto ISO needs a few minor fixes.  First it needs to have high shutter speeds as the minimum shutter speed setting.  The current 1/30th sec. is not adequate for many situations.  Secondly, Auto ISO does not work in manual mode.  It defaults to ISO 100 and must be changed manually.  There are times when one would like to be able to select Auto ISO and have the camera boost up ISO as needed to allow the aperture and shutter speed to have a range that will allow properly exposed images.  The latter is not a critical fault but rather an improvement.In manual mode one can obtain an exposure preview by \u00bd pressing the shutter button, looking at the histogram or the scale at the bottom of the screen and adjusting shutter speed, ISO or aperture (exposure compensation does not work).  This display feature is disabled in any other mode.  Aperture priority or shutter priority disables the preview display feature but enables exposure compensation when the circular silver button is pressed up.  One can then use the dial to select exposure compensation.  A \u00bd press will provide exposure compensation.Another irritation is the inability to scroll through images at magnification in order to compare images for focus.  In order to select a different image one must first reduce magnification to minimum and then go forward or backwards to select another image and re-magnify to compare.  It is slow and awkward and makes it difficult.There does not appear to be anyway to display the ISO selected by the camera prior to shooting a shot and performing a playback when auto ISO is selected.  As a result, one can't make a decision prior to shooting whether to accept the ISO selected by the camera or to manually intervene.A problem with manual focus is the lack of a depth of field display for the focus distance selected on the lens.  The calculation is based on focal length selected and aperture, all information the camera's computer has, so it would be easy for the camera to display the information at the bottom of the screen as a bar with the focus point and end-points clearly marked and displayed against a distance scale.  Another helpful assist would be to display the distance to the focus point during autofocus.  Then one could quickly get a distance reading to an object to set up for zone focusing in MF.  Additionally, one could see if the selected focus point was being properly selected.  For example, if the distance should 9 feet but you knew the distance should be less than 9 feet, you would know the camera is not focusing where you think it should be.For various reasons, the slow lens, need for fill light, etc., one might want to use the flash.  The flash has to be one of the most challenging to use because it is not predictable in its behavior.  In most cameras when flash is selected and enabled the flash automatically sets the shutter speed to a minimum shutter speed of 1/30th or higher.  With the Leica, whatever shutter speed would be required for the exposure without flash is the shutter speed used.  This works OK in a fill flash situation because you would normally have a high shutter speed.  But in a low light situation, where the camera meters a very slow shutter speed, and you have maxed your aperture, it shoots at the low shutter speed resulting in blurred and under exposed images.  Similar results can occur when using manually set shutter speeds and auto aperture.  It is all too easy to obtain a bad flash exposure.  Compared to the Fuji or the RX-1 that seem to read your mind and produce properly exposed flash images under nearly any condition imaginable it is a bit of a disappointment.I will be updating this review once I have had more time and learn more about the cameras operation and idiosyncrasies.  The last item I will discuss is the DNG files.The DNG files as produced out of the camera and interpreted in LR 5.2RC and to a lesser degree in Iridient Developer are way too soft and too low in contrast.  For LR I found I needed to create a preset with contrast at +32 and sharpening set to +95.  A similar preset was required for Iridient Developer.  I will show before and after images side by side to demonstrate what I am saying.  On the other hand, the files can withstand even higher levels of sharpening before breaking down.  The built in profile seems to be incorrect and the default LR profile is also incorrect.  The camera will sometimes overexpose but it corrects easily.  On the other hand the JPGs only require minor tweaks depending on individual taste to be usable right out of the camera.  Comparison images are included.Bottom LineDespite the negatives outlined above, this is an excellent camera and one I would not hesitate to recommend.  In fact, I think the camera is way underrated and had Leica not botched its introduction it would have been a very good seller.  As it sits right now, it is an undiscovered gem.  Many people will not give this camera a try because of all of the negative publicity.  I know I almost didn't.  I'm glad now that I took the chance.  Once people discover how good the images are from this camera and that the slow lens is not as big a detriment as first imagined, its popularity will increase.  If Leica makes a major improvement to the AF and fixes the few other small niggles this will be a fantastic camera!", "Date": "August 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "Leica X Vario Digital Compact Zoom Lens Camera review by Dale (update 2 Dec 2013)", "Author": "Dale Thorn", "ReviewID": "R2LWD5TSS7IDM1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Notes: This review covers my use of the new Leica X Vario camera for general-purpose photography, shooting JPEG format images only. I have owned the Leica M4-2 and M6 film cameras, with a 50mm fixed lens for the former and a 35mm fixed lens for the latter. I purchased the Leica X1 compact camera in early 2010, and used it for nearly 3 years before donating it to a photo club in Ohio. The X Vario is similar in many ways to the X1, given that both are digital cameras made in-house by Leica in Germany. There is also much resemblance between the X Vario and the 'M' film cameras in their heavy-duty construction, and the large heavy lens assembly of the X Vario in particular. The X1 by comparison has a fairly small lens assembly that pops out when the camera is switched on and collapses when the camera is switched off.Since the X Vario costs $2850 USD and is a simple camera with a short zoom range lens (28mm to 70mm in 135 equivalence), people who are not familiar with Leica or their raison d'etre might find the price shocking. Looking at this from a Leica owner's perspective, the next step up from the X Vario is the M9, which costs about $12000 to $13000 for camera with similar lens, and the next step up from that is the S2, which sells for approx. $30000 without lens. If you were thinking to buy one of these Leica cameras made in-house by Leica in Germany, based on its specifications as compared to other popular brands such as Fuji, Nikon, or Ricoh et al, then you would probably not want to consider the Leica any further because of the large price difference for comparable specifications. If you are familiar with the Leica brand and what they offer compared to other cameras having similar capabilities, then this review might be helpful since I won't be speculating on the reasons for those differences.I'm currently building a set of images for the X Vario at my dalethorn website, so check there occasionally to see what sort of results I'm getting with this camera. I made some initial comparisons to the Nikon Coolpix A, another APS-C camera with a high quality lens (and fairly high price), and viewing the images at 100 percent size on the screen, I note a slight advantage for the X Vario. This is especially good news, since the Nikon has only one focal length and the X Vario has to maintain that quality across the entire zoom range. I made a few comparisons to images I captured with the Leica X1, and the X Vario shows a slight improvement over those as well. Since the X Vario is much larger than the X1, it has the disadvantage (at this time) of not having a dressy camera case available such as the 18709 case for the X1. On the other hand, it's much easier than the X1 to hold and operate with my large hands.Removing the X Vario from its packaging, any concerns I might have had about the build quality or design evaporated instantly. It reminded me of the 'M' cameras much more than the X1, although on closer inspection some of the similarities to the X1 become apparent. I liked the X1 pretty well, but I thought it was near the lower limits of what I considered to be a good value for $2000. I have no such concerns about the X Vario - in fact, I feel quite lucky to be able to get this much of the 'M' camera look and feel (and build quality) for what I paid. I'm tempted to say that it's almost a steal at that price, but then I get the idea that Leica has done some research and found ways to produce this camera in sufficient quantity to keep the price down. Again, if you're not a collector or long-time user of Leica cameras, most of this price/value discussion will not make much sense.There were a set of videos released by Leica at the introduction of the S1, M9, and X1 circa September 2009, which detailed Leica's development and marketing plans for their full lineup of cameras going forward from that date. I would recommend those for anyone who wants to know more about the company and its products, and why they command the prices they do. Those videos should be available on Youtube et al, and they should provide some background that will make the X Vario design and Leica's other designs more understandable.Some photographers will buy their cameras based on a specific need or task they have to perform, others will purchase cameras based on getting a state-of-the-art design that they feel they can grow into, so they don't outgrow the camera immediately, and some users will buy cameras based on a combination of factors - how it looks, feels, and operates, etc. I bought the X Vario because I didn't have a Leica camera at the time, and with just the S2, M9, and X2 available, none of those had enough appeal to me to justify the expense. The X Vario was the perfect simple (but very high quality) camera for me at just the right time, offering manual and automatic features, a usable zoom/focal length range, and the perfect look and feel for continuous everyday use.When I'm out with the camera, I usually carry a backup of some kind, and depending on where I go and the subjects I'm likely to photograph, that second camera may be the very small APS-C equipped Nikon Coolpix A, or the Canon SX-280, a tiny-sensor compact camera with a 550mm effective zoom reach. It's not likely that I'll be using those backups much though, since the straightforward and simple design of the X Vario gives me nearly 100 percent of the control I need without having to access the menus or deal with controls whose function aren't obvious. The smaller cameras do have a distinct advantage in situations where a professional-looking camera might attract unwanted attention, or be prohibited outright, but for all else the X Vario wins since it fits the hand better and offers the best image quality.The X Vario comes with a neck strap, which I don't use because of the weight it puts on my neck, and a lithium-ion rechargeable battery pack with an external charger. The charger comes with a selection of AC mains plug types for most countries of the world. I'm using a wrist strap for the X Vario - a Leica strap I received with a different Leica product. That wrist strap is perfect for this camera since it's strong enough to complement the camera's size and weight. Most small digital camera lenses retract automatically when the camera is turned off, and a shutter or metal plate appears in front of the lens to protect it from being scratched. The X Vario lens does not retract, nor does it have a lens \"plate\" or shutter that protects the lens - it comes with a plastic lens cap that you remove to operate the camera, and replace when finished shooting. It would be very easy to lose this cap, and very bad if the lens got scratched, so it would be wise to purchase a backup lens cap.Summarizing, the Leica X Vario should be a great camera for a purist who wants very high image quality, very simple design and operation, and isn't greatly concerned about the high-performance features most professional users (i.e. mostly DSLR users) demand for their tasks. Those might include ultra-fast auto-focus and shot-to-shot times, large data buffers to allow for bursts up to dozens of images at a time, ability to deal with fast-moving subjects, and so on. I've read quite a lot of commentary by DSLR users who seem mystified by the X Vario's design and performance, and my advice to them is either forget about this camera entirely, or leave it for a time when they have a week with no work to do, and they can relax and enjoy some leisurely shooting with a type of camera that's optimized for high optical quality, not for speed.", "Date": "June 18, 2013"}, {"Title": "I'm very pleased with this purchase.", "Author": "Jeffrey W Morley", "ReviewID": "R1OZXJH5ZOV1MB", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a steep price point for me, and my expectations were high.

Autofocus slow (not good for moving targets), and the image stabilization is pathetic compared to Olympus or Nikon.  A camera for landscapes or posing people.  Not good in low light.  Can't handle glare well (this may be because it isn't designed to use filters and doesn't come with a lens hood (things improved when I bought an extortionately priced hood).  It does fabulously in broody, cloudy daytime (think daytime in New England, Holland, England, Scotland, Germany).  Also well indoors in daylight.  Wonderful detail and those gorgeous Leica colors.  The build quality a treat. Battery life is decent.  The upper dials have a tendency to get budged to the wrong settings when you are wearing gloves or just absent minded (say on a walk, or chasing elusive family members at a gathering).  No ability to lock them on auto.  It is wonderful to have such a small camera with such image quality.  The haters who trash this camera forget that IQ is, after all, the most important thing in a camera.  The reason why I've kept it, and why it's become my favorite camera, despite it's deficiencies.  I just can't afford the M system.Something fishy:  when I tried to download the Lightroom software that come with it,  from Leica they said that it had already been downloaded twice.  Made me wonder if I had been sold a regifted camera....or what.....Still waiting to hear from Leica what the story is.  I think the image quality of the Xi is better, but the versatility of the 28-70 focal length is better for travel, and the auto focus is better, for sure.", "Date": "January 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "It's made for Deep Pocker and No brainers", "Author": "Rose", "ReviewID": "RW9R28JX1L2XT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It's made for Deep Pocket and No brainersPricy, but people from CN love it.
