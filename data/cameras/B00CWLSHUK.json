{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Canon 5D vs Blackmagic Pocket Cinema", "Author": "E. K. Wlin", "ReviewID": "R2HWQSG63IFERK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "It is hard to part with this baby and I am using it everyday. Power keeps on running out but battery is very inexpensive so I bought a few. There are some draw backs on in-camera fuctions, such as no format option, audio, histogram, exposure meters and a dozen of tools that are normally in most cameras. Since Blackmagic is not a major player like Sony, Panasonic, Nikon and Canon, they may not have enough man power but I think these upgrades will come with the new firmware. It is an excellent pro video camera, easy to lug around and gets the job done. Its ISO performance is not comparable to the 5D in low light but under adequate lighting or outdoor it's sharper with more detail than a full frame. Anyway since the sensor is a small super 16, I didn't expect lower noise at high ISO. Still sensors in general have better ISO performance but they are prone to have moire issue and lower dynamic range. Even the Red Epic has noise problem in low light and I am hoping it will get much better with the new Dragon. There are an abundance of Micro 4/3 lens available for this camera but a wide lens is hard to find, only the Panasonic aspherical 7-14mm is wide enough. Anything wider will be a fisheye lens. I tried the Olympus 9-18mm and when framed in 9mm, it was comparable to my 24mm on the 5D. I have not measured it with a protractor but I am guessing the crop factor is more like 2.5 despite what was claimed. The BMPC may not be a consumer camera but I can't imagine any pro or enthusiast wouldn't want one in the bag. However, even for a rookie that can change with a bit of training. I must say when I first received it, I was a quite frustrated. It took a while to figure out the memory chip must be reformatted to exFAT with a PC and then I ran into problem playing back the clips. If it had been shipped with a quick start guide, it would have saved me time. It was a PITB so I will be focusing more on the initial setup which hopefully will make your life easier. I will be updating the feature and video quality review when I have more time.The following are what I feel should have been labeled on the box when it was shipped1. Only 94 mB/s or higher speed memory chip can be used. Otherwise you may get dropped frames even if it records. I have tried Sony and Sandisk Extreme Pro, both worked fine. I am sure most people get this one just by Googling.2. The one that really got me was that you need to reformat the card with a PC and the format must be exFAT, not other formats. I've found this information extremely difficult to find online and hidden in the manual. I thought the camera was broken, the error message NO SD will not turn off and the record button won't work. Finally after some major tinkering, I reformatted the card and everything started to work beautifully. This is normally a no brainer for a consumer camera or any pro camera so it caught me off guard.3. My next problem was that none of my video players would play the clips and I have tried a lot of them, not even my Vegas Pro would import the ProRes .mov format. I tried downloading DaVinci Resolve 9 on Blackmagic-design website. It was free but the bad news was, I couldn't get it to open or import a file. I have loaded and reloaded it on 3 of my PC and only one worked after hours of tinkering. This is a major manufacturer's oversight as they could have made it much more user friendly and transparent to the user.4. The next puzzle was that the video appeared washed out. I later discovered the reason was because it records in log format. Blackmagic adapted this format because it is easier to grade color during post editing. After I color graded the footage, it had more detail than the 5D Mark III. The 13 stops of dynamic range seems to be as advertised.Video qualityRolling shutter feels to be a bit better than the Canon 5D. I can pan the camera faster now. It does not show in Youtube that well due to the compression. It is as expected, the sensor is dedicated to video not still. Oh, it does not take still photos, it is not designed for that. The BMPC handles moire quite well. Check out the unedited footage in Youtube by searching \"Turbo Ace Matrix Quadcopter and Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera unedited aerial footage\". For in-depth review of the video quality, try using the Google Chrome browser and set resolution to 1080p.BenefitsThe dynamic range of 13 makes the video sharper with more detail than any of the DSLR including my 5D.More noise shows in low light condition with the same ISO compared to the 5D. Again that is expected from a smaller sensor.It is much smaller and extremely light weight compared to the DSLRAfter color grading the video is extremely sharp but you can't replay instantly and expect great colors.A very nice selection of Micro 4/3 lens at great savings. I recommend the Olympus 9-18mm zoom.Price is unbelievable for the quality it producesApple ProRes comes in handy for editingSolidly built, it is mostly made of metalAuto focus does work somewhat and it comes in handy under sunlight. It is a bit slow but not a big deal as I shoot mostly in manual.Battery is a Nikon 7.4V EN-EL20 Type Lithium-Ion easily obtainable at great price.DisappointmentsIt is hard to find a wide lens due to the smaller sensorShortage of functions in the camera, no in-camera format, not a big deal for me.No dial, makes it cumbersome to change exposure.Run time is short and requires constant battery change. I wish the battery is twice the size because it isn't heavy anyway.30fps is max, hope there is 60fps someday.No exposure or histogram so you will need a light meter. But at 1/3 the price of a 5D, I can't complain.Not user friendly, takes a while to get everything workingNo audio meter but that may change with the new firmwareWish it has the more popular mini HDMI port instead of micro. Micro HDMI is not as popular and it was painful to find a small right angle one to work on my Matrix quadcopter.Finally, do I recommend this camera and should the average Joe buy it? Only if you really care about video quality and have the patience to put up with the initial setup. The final production quality is stunning so it is well worth it for me. Blackmagic has excellent technology and provides tremendous value but lacks in customer interface and proper documentation. In the end, it delivers the quality I want and that is why I am giving it a 5 star. I only had the camera for a few days and for those who wish there is more in-depth coverage of video quality, please bare with me as I will be adding them later. I will also be doing more Youtube reviews and post them here for your reference. Great work Blackmagic and thank you for watching.Specifications*Super 16mm Sized Image Sensor*Active Micro Four Thirds Lens Mount*13 Stops of Dynamic Range*Records Full HD 1920x1080 CinemaDNG RAW*Apple ProRes 422 (HQ) at 220 Mbps*Compact Design (5\" Long and 12.5 oz)*3.5\" LCD Display with 800x480 Resolution*Uses SDXC and SDHC Memory Cards*EN-EL20 Compatible Rechargeable Battery*HDMI, LANC, 3.5mm Audio Input and OutputCameraSensor Size  12.48 x 7.02 mm (effective)Effective Resolution  1920 x 1080Dynamic Range  13 stopsLens Mount  Active MFTRecordingRecording Media  Removable SDXC and/or SDHC cards (exFAT or HFS+ format)Recording Formats  Lossless CinemaDNG RAWApple ProRes 422 (HQ) (QuickTime MOV)Recording Resolution  1920 x 1080Frame Rates  23.98p, 24p, 25p, 29.97p, 30pBit Rate  220 Mbps using Apple ProRes 422 (HQ)InterfaceVideo Output  Micro HDMI type D (x1)Digital Audio Output  2 channels, 48 kHz and 24 bit (embedded in HDMI output)Analog Audio Input  3.5mm stereo mini jack (x1)Analog Audio Output  3.5mm stereo mini jack (x1)Remote Control  2.5mm LANC (x1) for record START/STOP, iris control and focusComputer Interface  USB 2.0 mini B port (for software updates and configuration)Power Input  0.7mm DC jack for power and battery charging (x1)DisplayDisplay Type  Integrated LCDDisplay Size  3.5\"Display Resolution  800 x 480GeneralBuilt-In Microphone  Integrated stereo microphoneBuilt-in Speaker  Integrated mono speakerMounting  1/4\"-20 UNC thread (x1, on top of camera)1/4\"-20 UNC thread (x1, tripod mount on the bottom)Supported Software  Apple Final Cut Pro, Adobe After Effects, Nuke - The Foundry, Adobe Photoshop, DaVinci ResolveOperating System  Mac OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion or laterWindows 7 or laterPower  12-20 VDCBattery  Type: EN-EL20 compatible, rechargeable lithium ion batteryBattery Life: approx. 1 hour of continuous recording timeCharge Time: approx. 1 hour and 15 minutes when the camera is off and approximately 2 hours when in useOperating Temperature  32 ~ 104\u00b0 F (0 ~ 40\u00b0 C)Storage Temperature  -4 ~ 113\u00b0 F (-20 ~ 45\u00b0 C)Relative Humidity  0 ~ 90% non-condensingDimensions  5.04 x 1.49 x 2.6 (128 x 38 x 66 mm)Weight  12.52 oz (355 g)", "Date": "November 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "There's nothing like it in this price, outstanding quality but with significant considerations", "Author": "Darren Levine \"He shoots, He Edits, He freque...", "ReviewID": "R24N5XOU2OYFB3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This company is doing great things, that is to say, they're doing what other companies are not. It works out great for us since it gives us new tools to choose from, and sometimes gets the other manufacturers to compete and give us more.The pocket camera is an interesting tool, and if you're on a budget you'll be hard pressed to compare it to anything else out there at the moment, but that really does come down to its very high quality recording format, if you were to take that away, it would be a far less interesting camera.Let's get right into the breakdownPros-very portable-RAW video, unheard to be built in-camera and at this price(though compressed)-Uses a wide variety of lenses(active vs dumb mount for m43-Same sensor image quality/color/sharpness as BMC-Really cheap all things consideredAnd now the not so nice considerations...-Very short battery life, & external batteries add size/weight-NOT a low light friendly camera(bring lights!

I can't compare it to other consumer cameras because it is not like any other video camera you can buy under $5,000.  If you want a certain type of image, then the drawbacks of this camera are insignificant.This camera is not over-hyped. It records 10x more image detail than any video camera you paid less then $5,000 for. These are the facts.The total pixels in a frame is 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels high.  A total of about 2 million pixels. In one second, we watch 30 of those frames, or roughly 60 million pixels per second. For a minute we'd need 60 million times 60 seconds, or 3.6 billion little dots of color. Even for a computer, that's a lot.The human eye can discern about 12 million colors.  We need 3 bytes per pixel, or, in the above example, 10.8 gigabytes per minute*. As you know, you're not streaming 10 gigabytes of video to your TV every minute. Video compression cuts it down to a manageable size.  However, video compression throws out image data that, if you want to change the video later, let's say, make the clouds more billowy, or the grass blades sharper, is impossible to do.The BMPCC throws out 10-times less visual information than your DSLR in video-mode.  It saves the full color value for EVERY pixel.  You can take a frame from this camera, print it on a normal photo paper, and it will look exactly like a photograph.  If you do that with the video that comes out of other cameras, it will look okay, but will be missing a fair amount of detail and color nuance.  You didn't notice the missing colors that were \"compressed\" away because the video was moving too fast.Consumer video is tuned to appeal to our biological preference for sharp and saturated images.  It is like our desire for salt and sugar in food.  The BMPCC records the full range of color. It is the antithesis of the fast-food camera. You can make the image look like candy, just like what you get from current DSLRs (if you go for a neutral image you end up with mushy blacks).  You can also make it look like a subtle watercolor, with thousands of shades of each color--which you can't do with your DSLR.Visually, the biggest difference between this camera technology, and others, is noticeable in skin-tone and shadow detail.  With the BMPCC, and other RAW-based cameras, you can get natural skin tones (in my opinion) and the shadows in your images won't be crushed to black.  I love the image that comes out of this camera.  This camera has re-freshed my love for video (because it looks like film) just as the Sigma DP1 did for stills.* The camera doesn't record 10 gigabytes per minutes because all cameras (except Sigmas) only record one color at each pixel (It later borrows color information from neighboring pixels to create a full color--a subject unto itself).  Anyway, at 30 frames per second the BMPCC records 12-bits of color information at each pixel (red, green or blue), which equals about 5.6 gigabytes per minute, at 30fps, in RAW mode.  It does some simple compression to about 4GB per minute.UPDATE 12/7/2013All the video forums were full of people who couldn't wait for this camera to come out.  Now that it's here, the forums seem oddly quiet.  I would think there would be 50 reviews on Amazon by now.  I attribute this apparent apathy to a general truth--most people don't see a problem with their existing video solution.  Either their phone or DSLR is good enough.  The more I use this camera, the more I'm struck by how much ahead of its time it is.  In time, it will make people cringe to look at the video they took with any camera up to 2013, just as DV obliterated VHS, then 1080p to DV.I don't want to sugar-coat anything.  The file sizes are large and slows everything down--from copying to editing, etc.  The video is very easy to take; grading and editing is slow and cumbersome.I could make the argument that the time one needs to work with video hasn't changed, just moved around.  With the BMPCC there are few settings.  You select your ISO (usually 800), press IRIS, then focus, then shoot.  With H.264, you have to set your ISO, aperture, shutter speed VERY CAREFULLY because if the exposure is at all off everything goes to heck.  Once in \"post\", there isn't much you can do with H.264. What's over-exposed stays over-exposed, what's under-exposed stays under-exposed.With the BMPCC, you can adjust many aspects of the image in post.  That is a double-edged sword.  Great, if you know how to make images look good.  Bad, if you don't really know what you want and would just assume live with whatever comes out of the camera.Another way you can use this camera, which I am now exploring, is as a 24 frames per second 1920x1080 still camera.  I'm always frustrated by not getting exactly the right smile out of my subjects.  With the BMPCC I can pick a frame and it will be completely suitable for FB or any web use.Again, it must be pointed out, consumer video is created from images compressed into a stream, meant to be re-played in motion (where you can cheat details).  The BMPCC takes 2 megapixel photographs every 30th or 24th of second.  Nothing is thrown out.  I can see the difference.

So what if you need a few extra?One more thing: for a GREAT looking picture with manageable storage requirements, record in RAW and convert to Cineform 444 (as of this writing, BMPCC RAW cannot be converted to CF RAW).

The images coming out of this camera are incredible. The detail is lovely.-Codec: 95% I shoot in prores which is leaps and bounds better than h264. The amount of information in the prores HQ codec is fantastic. It allows for so much more flexibility in post regarding color grading. Raw DNG is even better which I use more for landscape and city shots.-Dynamic rage: 13-stops. Enough said.-Focus peaking/zebras: These are VERY helpful. I set zebras to 100% and ETTR (most of the time) for maximum dynamic range. Focus peaking is also very helpful. The autofocus is pretty lame, so I don't bother with it.-Form factor: Okay, so most people don't like the form factor, but I love it. You can rig up a small camera to be big, but you can't make a big camera smaller. Get my point? I can put my panny 14-45 OIS, grab some extra batteries and just shoot with that if I am on vacation or walking around town. I can \"blend\" in with crowds easier as it just looks like I'm holding a point-and-shoot. I can also rig the crap out of it with a follow focus, matte box, EVF, etc if I needed for a production environment.-Sensor: there is a con to it (explained below). Why is it a \"pro,\" as well? Lenses! There are lots of old lenses out there than can be utilized with this sensor size.-Active MFT mount: Using my 14-45 OIS (has physical OIS switch), I can utilize the stabilization if using handheld. With adapters, like the Metabones speedbooster, the lens options are virtually limitless.The shortcomings (for me); battery life, storage, file sizes, light, camera controls.-Battery life: I am not the first, and won't be the last to say that battery life on the little EN-EL20 is just sad. Buy some extra batteries for your walk-around-town/minimalist setup--they're cheap. Another option is to purchase an external battery solution. Yes, you can spend lots of money getting some sort of V-Mount setup, or you can buy something like an AnkerPro external battery with the correct adapter, and you'll have power for hours.-Storage: This camera DEMANDS fast SD cards and lots of storage. Let's remember WHY: 12-Bit Compressed raw DNG or 10-bit ProresHQ 422! These files are HUGE but contain loads of information for color grading. Tip:Go to Blackmagic Design's website for approved SD cards before you start spending money.-File sizes: As previously mentioned, the file sizes are very large--prores or raw. Make sure you have a FAST hard drive with lots of storage. That being said, make sure your computer has enough horsepower to edit the footage from the BMPCC (especially if using Resolve Lite).-Light demanding: This is NOT a low-light camera, nor should you expect it to be with the super-16mm sensor size. However, the noise pattern is much more pleasing to the eye than any DSLR.-Camera controls: I wish I could control the color temp with the navigation buttons instead of having to go through the menu options. ASA is not a huge deal to me as I always stay at 800 (native ISO) and use the aperture and variable ND for exposure.So, why did I end up buying this camera? Well, I understood the shortcomings, I knew how I would use it, and it fit my budget. This camera fits most situations that I will be shooting. Is it for every situation? NO! There isn't a camera on the market that is best for ALL situations. Again, get the camera that fits you, your objectives, your aptitude for editing, and your budget. This camera fit the bill for me, and I absolutely love it. Hope this helps someone.", "Date": "May 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Astonishing Video Quality.... But lot's of shortcomings.", "Author": "M. S.

For it's price, it is truly astonishing, either ProRes or RAW come out with an amazing quality of color and resolution (once you Color Grade them). Coming from a DSLR, it is truly impresive.Regretfuly, I'm not sure if I will keep it for many reasons:- it's huge crop factor (3x instead of 2x like normal m43 cameras)- no image stabilization on camera (most good lenses for the system don't have is)- 30fps limit (i wish it did 60?)- it is very, very small...- screen is too dim.I already have a m43 camera, and bought this one because the video quality of my m43 camera is not that good. I am impressed with the quality of this one, but I would need to buy a ton of equipment to make it useful:- metabones speedbooster for crop factor (400 dollars)- is stabilized lenses (changing my olympus for a panasonic 12-35.... about 500 dollars)- viewfinder attachment (200 dollars)- rig (200/400 dollars.- sound recorder (already have one, 150 dollars)So in total, it would cost me around 1500 dollars to make it worth it... and for that price, I might as well sell it and get a Panasonic GH4, which doesn't have the same astonishing video quality, but it's certainly close enough and does include a nice viewfinder, lcd and has a normal crop factor.In summary, if you are a pro that NEEDS the RAW quality... get it.

The first being battery life.  Yes I'm going to complain about the battery life just like everyone else!  Can you say, \"Red Flag\"?  The battery life on this camera is laughably horrid.  You're lucky to get maybe 30 mins of shooting time, and that's shooting with ProRes.  Shoot with RAW and you're looking at about 20 mins.  20 MINS!  What a joke.  I can't take Blackmagic seriously with a number like that.  Did they not think this would be a deal breaker to most people?Next, the SD card choices.  There aren't any.  You have to get the fastest most expensive cards in order to reliably shoot with this thing.  And you can really only get about 40 mins of ProRes on a 64 gb card.  A whopping 20 mins in RAW!  Again, another funny yet pathetic number that just makes me shake my head and sigh deeply.And my last gripe.  Why does this thing cost a thousand dollars?  It's the size of my old point and shoot camera, and that camera had more features.  I read a few reviews and they were saying that this is a professional camera.  It is?  Why?  I looks like a toy and it is nonfunctional in the field.  Unless you buy 15 batteries and remember to charge them all before you go out.  This camera is about as far from professional as you can get.  You show up on set with this thing and the client will laugh you out of the building and never hire you again.  Try $299, and that's being generous.  Judging by the amount of people trying to get rid of this thing on ebay like I did, that number will be pretty accurate in about 3 months.To save your time, I'm not going to go into the ridiculous crop factor or the time it takes to figure out which lenses will work, which is about 4 weeks on my end.I liked the images I was able to get, after color correction city.

Where as it would take my 1 sec to change my ISO settings on my other camera...this one required a good 5-10 seconds...going back and forth picking the exact right one.You can hit the OK button twice to zoom in and better your focus and hit the FOCUS button...but beware of hitting the IRIS button! So many times I wiould have it set to the settings I want, then the camera's shutter angle would dictate otherwise.Honestly my video from my Fujifilm HS25EXR came out better, especially in lower light settings.The memory care was another issue...I was finally able to open the .mov files to convert them to .mp4 to edit...since they are HUGE! (40 second shot was 1GB or so)The audio quality, as obvious to any other DSLR is not even usable, so use a RODE VideoMic or TACSAM recorder to gather your audioThe buk,d quality is NICE, the bottwm door for the battery and SD Card is badly engineered as you are forced to manually push back the pin to keep the door locked.The screen will desply in green what is in focus, which does help..In the end after shooting a day with this....I would NOT buy this. I ended up using my HS25EXR (not even a DSLR) for the movie shot since the battery on this dies out way too quicklySure it's small and versatile, but it did not suit me...I may just end up getting a Canon T3i and hacking it with black lantern.... for half the price", "Date": "March 16, 2014"}, {"Title": "Different than Advertised", "Author": "djunod", "ReviewID": "RD9CVBCR2YKF1", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "Loved reading the website about this camera, got me all excited.  Now I have the camera.  It's not very exciting.  The video has to be processed before burning to public, otherwise it is way too dark.  Audio using the onboard mic really sucks, continually cutting out and then back on.
