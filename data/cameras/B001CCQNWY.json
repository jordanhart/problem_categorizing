{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Sexiest, Sleekest, Coolest Camera on the Market", "Author": "TL", "ReviewID": "R3KWZOEN1BZ7O0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I preordered my camera in red and was a little disappointed in the saturation of the red because it's slightly pink.  The color images online are pretty close so if you're not sure, go to a store and check it out first.  I was only hoping that it would turn out to be a deeper red.On a positive note, I love the ease of this camera.  I especially love the scene+ option that automatically takes an extra picture with automatic adjustments during certain lighting conditions.  This makes your picture a little more foolproof.  The automatic programming is extremely smart and it can recognize the lighting conditions and make the appropriate adjustments.  I've been pleased with my pictures so far just on automatic and I haven't had to make any adjustments yet, but there are a lot of extra features and programs to help you take great pictures in the snow, at the beach, etc.  The second picture also manages to remove red eyes.  I also have a Canon SD1100 IS which never manages to remove my dog's red eyes.  I have to manually remove the red eye through its software, but it comes out distorted, scary, and not completely removed.  This Sony T700 sucessfully takes a picture of my dog without red eyes.On the downside, if you take a picture you like but have red eyes in the picture, the red eye removal function in the camera won't work because it is only set-up to remove red eyes in the faces of people and not animals.  (The Canon lets you choose the red eye area for removal).I love the slideshow that the Sony T700 can produce and you can even upload your own music onto your camera.  You can also create scrapbook pages on the camera for a fun way to show-off your pictures.The Sony T700's screen is sexy, but the downside of its large LCD touch screen is that it's draining on the battery and fingerprints will drive you up the wall.  I haven't tested how long the battery can last continuously (the manual says something around 2+ hours), but I have had to recharge the battery with minimal use after about four days (versus my Canon in which the first time I charged it after minimal use was about 2 weeks).  I'm considering buying an extra battery but haven't done it yet.As for the fingerprints on the touch screen, I invested in an invisible shield to protect the screen.  You can use the paintpen that comes with the camera to minimize fingerprints, but you can't avoid getting fingerprints on the Sony screen because you still have to handle the camera (unless you're very very careful which can be annoying).  With the invisible screen you can rub the screen clean without worrying about scratching the screen and fingerprints aren't a problem with the invisible screen on.  Just be careful about installing the shield and watch the videos online for tips on how to install it without having to retry it over and over.  Make sure the screen is clean before installing otherwise little specs of dust might drive you crazy and you won't be able to clean it.  The other thing with the invisible screen is that the company's website hasn't marketed a screen for the Sony T700, but if you buy the screen for the T300, it fits fine.  With the invisible screen on, I don't have to worry about fingerprints or damaging my beautiful LCD touch screen.  There are a lot of invisible screens out there, but I purchased the screen from the company that makes military grade invisible protection because they have a lifetime warranty and the product isn't sticky.  Just make sure you purchase the screen directly from the manufacturer or from an authorized dealer otherwise the lifetime warranty will be invalid.The 4GB built-in memory is great, but I bought a 4GB memory stick to use to make printing at a store easier.  On the highest quality setting, it holds over 900 pictures and the number of pictures it holds for e-mail quaility is ridiculous (I think it's about 9999).One other slight downside is that the digital zoom only reaches 8x whereas my Canon SD1100 IS reached 12x.  A little disappointing, but not that big of a deal.  The macro setting on the Sony T700 for close-ups on an object is amazing though.  It captured the weaving in my 1000TC pillowcase exceptionally well when I was taking some test shots.Overall, I love this camera.  It's a bit pricey considering my $200+ camera from Canon is pretty good.  I spent close to $600 buying this camera, accessories (camera case, memory stick, and invisible shield), and a 2 year accidental warranty for it.  For the extra money, I got a lot of extra flashy things that gives it a wow factor.  Other cameras can give you pictures just as good, but this camera is extremely easy to use and there are a lot of foolproof functions to help you take great pictures.  I'm not a photographer so I don't understand how to adjust the EV and other things so with my Canon SD 1100 IS, I take decent pictures.  But with all of the extra features in the Sony T700, its foolproof ease of use allows me to take exceptional pictures for the most part.Update:Another slight annoyance with this camera as opposed to my Canon SD1100 is that it is not easy to switch to video mode.  My Canon has a button on the camera that I can slide back and forth easily.  With this camera, I have to go through several on-screen menus.This camera can also only take 10 minutes of continuous video recording.  I believe my Canon SD1100 gave me 12 minutes.  I understand that these manufacturers don't want your camera to take the place of a camcorder, but I find it extremely annoying!  I only want about 20-35 minutes of continuous recording.  I like recording the shows at Disneyland and I hate having to lug around both a camera and a camcorder.  It's really frustrating to have your video cut-off in the middle of a show.  I still own a pricey Sony Handycam to record recitals, games, events, etc and I wouldn't think of using a camera to capture important memories like these on video.  My friend has an Olympus camera that doesn't have a time limit in video recording mode, however, I don't think it's a bad thing for the manufacturers put in a time limit in their cameras especially if they have a camcorder line.  I just wish these manufacturers would increase their continuous video recording limit just a little bit on their cameras.However, after over a year with this camera, I still adore it!  I also love the PMB software it comes with.  The program analyzes the images you import into your computer and you can filter through the images by face or scenery.  It isn't perfect with its face detection (ie. sometimes it will tag my face as my sister's face, etc.), but it's still impressive.  The only thing I would change is to increase the continuous video recording limit.  All of the other slight annoyances aren't that big of a deal.  I've been looking at the last two newer generations of this line and I am disappointed that they took away the awesome large hard drive.  I thought about buying a newer model because the newer line has an Exmor R sensor and a pet mode, but without the hard drive, I'm just not interested.  Hopefully if Sony ups the continuous recording time limit and includes a built in hard drive on future models, I would consider an upgrade.  I also see that the newer models went back to the design look of the T300 (100 or 200??? I can't remember) For now, I'll stick to my T700 that all of my friends lust over!", "Date": "October 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very pretty camera, not so pretty pictures", "Author": "A. Jeng \"momotoy\"", "ReviewID": "RMGW1QB8QY36V", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I owned a SONY DSC-T100, Sony's first generation of this style of ultra-compact digital camera. After a few iterations, I was hoping Sony has improved its picture quality. In some areas, the usability has improved dramatically.Likes: - Touch screen is very usable. You can even touch you subject on the screen to tell the camera to spot-focus on your subject. - Smile detection is good under daylight. - Optical Zoom and autofocus work in movie mode, which is a good deal-sealer for people who need a really useful movie mode. - In-camera editing tools are quite user-friendly. Amazing usability - 4GB internal memory is a big plus. I never find myself needing extra Memory Stick. I take all my pictures with 3:2 ratio (3MB+ per photo), the internal memory can contain approximately 996 pictures. That's enough for me. I usually download pictures to my PC every day.Dislikes: - Smile detection does not work well with indoor pictures because it disables Red-eye Reduction feature. This makes sense because red-eye reduction slows down the shot and may miss the smile. - Battery life is very short. If you need to go for even a day trip, you certainly need an extra battery. So, this is the cost you need to consider before purchasing this camera. - Indoor focus accuracy with flash is not great. I found this too be true with most ultra compact cameras, including Canon 1100. Even with successful face detection, the pictures often show out-of-focus subjects with clear background. This is true with my old Sony DSC-T100. It appears Sony has not resolved this issue after so many generations with Tx00 Series. So, be sure to take multiple shots with flash. - White spots on some night shots. It's very unfortunate. The camera flash is too close to the lens. When the flash fires at a reflective dust in the air, you get white spots on people's hair or some empty space in your pictures. It really ruins a nice picture. - High noise level in night shots (with flash or not)Finally after 3 weeks of use, I returned the camera. No more ultra-compact cameras for us.I hope this review helps potential buyers. Try shooting in all kind of lighting condition and see for yourself if noise levels are acceptable to you. High-pixel cameras produce relatively more noise.Overall, in terms of picture quality, Sony has not improved it since DSC-T100.", "Date": "December 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great for teens and amateur enthusiasts", "Author": "Betsey Van Horn \"switterbug\"", "ReviewID": "RGE3VVNX1YLKU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are looking for the ideal point-and-shoot camera for your teenager, this is a superb choice. (Great for adults, too!)  It fits right in with an active, portable lifestyle-- it is light-weight, user-friendly, tech-smart and smart-looking.  Sleek. It looks a lot like kin to the itouch phone or itouch ipod, with its square shape and sleek surface on which you prime your menu and edit with the touch of a finger (or included pen). My teenage daughter loves it and assesses it as \"superior.\"  It fits right in with her tech-loving lifestyle. Even the low-light pictures at the skating rink are respectable.There are a lot of cool features for preparing and editing your photos. They include smile-detection, smile improvement (where the camera can actually sort of stretch the sides of the mouth, weird as that sounds), red-eye removal.  There are also arty features such as choosing a center point and surrounding the periphery in monochrome, a starburst feature that adds flair to pics, a blurry edge feature, and ability to write captions.It comes with a rechargeable battery, a  recharger, and built-in memory stick that takes thousands of pictures. I recommend purchasing an external memory stick if you want to take photos to be printed by your local store.  The only non-user-friendly feature my daughter came across was the flash.  She said that it was counterintuitive and that the manual did not help her to program it in.  She did finally get a friend (who has had this camera for a while) to help her program the flash, and she has had no problems ensue.  My daughter is typically tech savvy, so this is notably a salient concern.Thanks to a reviewer on this site, I have ordered a military-grade invisible shield to protect her screen.  I highly recommend it--teens are hard on electronics.Lastly,she asked for it in grey, which surprised me.  I thought she would want one of the flashy colors, but she pointed out that the flashy colors also attract sticky fingers in public places.  The muted colors draw less attention.The price keeps going down.  I bought it for $399 a few weeks ago and the price has gone down twice.

I took that to the MotoGp race last month and found that sometimes it's just better to have something small.

Almost 5 months since I bought, I haven't had any regrets with the purchase. This camera looks perfect, and its features are equally outstanding. I love how wide the touchscreen is, and how I can upload the latest MP3s as background music for the slideshow.

I was heading to the SEMA show in Vegas, and my ancient Sony P-10 was starting to show its age. I didn't want to lug my Canon DSLR around, so I went shopping for a nice and compact P&S.;The size of the camera is similar to a cell phone. I use my T-Mobile G1's soft case for the Camera instead of the phone. The picture quality is superb (as expected from upper tier cybershot cameras) in most situations. Like usual, shooting in dim light and in the dark don't work out for Sony Cameras... it's definitely leaps and bound better than the previous ones I've owned though (this is Cybershot number 5 in my household).The on-board 4gb of storage is great. It's meant to serve as a photo album. A memory stick duo should be used for normal shoots, while the on-board storage should be used for small resolution photo galleries. 4gb of duo in addition to 4gb of on-board memory should be enough for most.The touch-screen interface is decent. The only gripe I have is that is smudges quite easily. Aside from that, it functions well.Overall, it's a great ultra compact P&S; model. It gets the job done for general use and has a very nice form and feel. The metallic casing shows its position in the cybershot line. Definitely recommended, especially at the current Amazon price ($270) at the time of this review.

It also alerts you when it thinks someone has blinked in your picture-very handy.

Perry \"Godsgirlerific\"", "ReviewID": "R2ATRNWCA0BS5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera, and it's fantastic!! The touch screens on some of the older or less expensive Cybershot models go all funky-colored when you press on them, but this model's touch screen is much sturdier- no wavy color effects when you press on it. It also comes with a 4G memory, which equals about 1000 photos at the 10MP setting and over 1500 at the 5MP setting!!My favorite feature is the way the battery charges. It's a little rectangular battery that you slide out of the camera and insert into a dock with a flip-out outlet plug. You don't have to plug the camera itself into anything, which is fantastic for a camera as slim as this! What makes this such a spectacular feature for me is that my last camera (a Casio Exilim) came with a dock that you set the entire camera in. After about a year and a half, the dock was damaged, making it impossible to either charge my camera or transfer photos to my computer. When I went to get a new dock, however, Casio no longer made any docks that were compatible with my camera, and the only place I could find a compatible dock was on eBay in Hong Kong for a price that was far above what the dock was worth. With this camera, I don't have to worry about the camera itself becoming unusable simply because one of its accessories is damaged.Another feature I like is the focus. You can touch the screen wherever you want the camera to focus, rather than the camera automatically focusing on the middle of the shot.And the image stabilization really does work! On the drive home from the store I took a picture out the window, and while the outside images were a bit fuzzy, the reflection on the window was perfectly in focus- while the vehicle was in motion! Most cameras would just get confused and make it all blurry. That really impressed me.One of the other complaints about some of the previous touch-screen models is that one's right thumb would rest on the upper right side of the screen and accidentally keep hitting the buttons there. This camera has a bit of a buffer in the form of a ribbed strip of plastic about 1/4\" wide, providing a place to rest your thumb off of the screen.And gosh, this camera is just so stylish and sharp!!

The slick brushed aluminum body, the 3.5 inch brilliant touch-screen display, and it's slim profile. Basically I needed a decent sub-compact point and shoot camera, and the first time I saw the T700 in the store, I knew it's what I wanted.I'm not a huge camera buff, so I can't speak in depth of the optics. I have seen many complaints from other reviewers, but to my untrained eye they look absolutely fine. I have a HD 22inch monitor and the photos look great. But then again I have only been snapping close ups of friends and family. No landscapes just yet, but then again I plan on a DSLR for pictures like those. I have also read complaints about the T700's weakness in low light conditions, but I have snapped a few shots in a dark night club, and the pictures came out perfect. The flash is rather bright. Battery life will dissapoint you though. I don't feel I need an extra, because this is nothing more than a casual camera for me. But if you plan on taking this on vacation and attempt to use it all day, be prepared for an expensive paperweight.The camera has all kinds of fun little features. It has a cool slideshow/scrapbook application that you can add preloaded music to. You can draw on photos with the included stylus and save them with the editing on the huge 4gb internal memory. Smile detection works rather well. I even pointed the camera at my TV and tracked faces and detected the smiles on it as well.As for flaws I could only really name a few, for I have only owned the camera for like a week with limited use. The LCD is obivously a fingerprint magnent. Buy a screen protector and that should be remedied. The touch-screen doesn't always respond instantly, might be considered a bit heavy for some. Hmmm? That's really it from me. I mean I bought it for looks, so everything else is just added bonus. I knew flaws before I purchased. I love it.

Sung", "ReviewID": "RQTJ4CPROANF0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The picture quality is probably as good as it gets with a slim camera.  I'm going to review this based on the following:1. Size - The camera is about the size of an iPhone, but maybe around 3/4 of inch shorter.  It's very small and very thin, but because the framing is mostly metal, it a little heavier than you would expect.  However, having said that, it's very sturdy.2.  Convenience - So this is a mixed bag of good and bad...The camera is small and strudy, but it is a touchscreen so I would recommend a plastic sticker or film to lace over that part.  IN addition, the touchscreen is not electro-capacitive (I'm not sure if that's the right term) so you have to \"tap\" and you will not be able to \"touch\" the screen for a response.  This is not too much of a problem because the included lanyard has a stylus sttachment.  I find it far more convenient to just use my fingers, but depending on how you handle the camera, it may not be in issue.3.  Quality - I'm no expert, but I think most pictures can be blown up to at least 5x7 without much of a problem.  One of the big perks that I love about this camera is that it has an HD Aspect Ratio that allows pictures you take to fit newer monitors without stretching/tiling the pic.  I find that I don't see that many red eye pics and oddly enough, the smiling recognition does a decent job.4. Storage - MS Pro Duo, either love it or hate it...but with this model you have the option to use the internal 4gigs inside..unfortunately there is no cohesive way for the camera to deal with both the internal and any external pro duo cards you use.  Without going into the manual much, basically it's one or the other.Overall, I really like this camera and it is simple enough that you almost don't mind the limitations of the touchscreen.

Reg. $399)I have owned the Sony DSC-P73 for many years. It has been an awesome camera and it still works. But I wanted a new one for mainly one reason.... a larger screen. I have been looking for a new camera for a few years. The Sony T2 & the T300 both have caught my eye. But I decided to wait until one camera had all I wanted. The T700 has all I want and then some.The first thing you notice with this camera is its screen. It has a gigantic 3.5 in extra fine LCD touch screen with only 3 buttons located on the top (power, shutter and playback). This camera is sleek to say the least. Once on the screen is bright and can be viewed easily in daylight, without too much glare. For such a little camera it also packs a big zoom that is plenty for a point and shoot. While it took me a few hours to learn the interface design I now have it down packed and can maneuver easily though the settings. It has 4 GB of internal memory so you will always have room for that picture perfect shot. Plus it will take Memory Stick Duo if you do need any extra room. It will take wide-screen pictures (16:9) and will put out HD quality pictures with an additional cord.  The Smile Shutter is pretty neat, automatically snapping the picture once everyone is smiling. Though I have found it to be a little slow if more than 3 people are in the picture. Now while the large screen is awesome it does have its draw back. The battery life is much shorter than my old Sony only averaging 8-10 hours of constant use. Luckily the battery will fully charge in 2.5-3 hours, but you may what to keep a spare on hand. Overall I could not be happier with this camera. It truly is Like No Other.", "Date": "December 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Not Impressed", "Author": "S. Braitsch", "ReviewID": "R1C1CSTLA1A125", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera a few weeks ago to replace my Sony DSC-T7 which I loved btw. My main gripe with this model is it's terrible user interface. I feel like the camera is cluttered with superfluous menus that allow for a ridiculous number of auto shooting styles and auto musical slideshows and such non-sense. There should be a few stock auto settings for the novice user and one mode that is fully programmable for those who want a little more control over their point and shoot images.A few other things that drive me crazy about this camera are:1. The onscreen instructions that appear every time you switch between shooting mode and preview mode. I KNOW how to select between the images, can't stand having to wait three seconds for the on-screen instructions to disappear everytime I playback.2. The preview/playback button itself is too small. It was perfect on the DSC-T7, they should have made it larger and put it on the top of the camera opposite the shutter.3. The text of all the onscreen menus is heavily aliased and blurry. Gives the product as a whole a somewhat cheap feeling that they didn't put much thought into it.Other than all that the images it takes are acceptable. Nothing great.Definitely try it out in a store somewhere before you buy.

I'm an average camera user and probably easier to please than the more tech-savvy photographers, but I'm really enjoying this purchase.  I use it for leisure, but I do want to take \"frameable\" artistic shots now and then, and I've gotten some great pictures already.It's so compact, yet the touchscreen is big and makes the camera very easy to use.  The menu is simple, which is great when you're trying to get a shot and need to hurry to change the settings.  It's intuitive and quick.  My pictures have turned out with very vivid color and look just like what I'm seeing in person.  The settings are so easy to access, I've found myself using them more than I did with a non-touchscreen, and in return I'm getting better pictures in a variety of environments.The size of the touchscreen is nice and it doesn't feel as fragile as I'd worried.  It has a rubbery feel that resists scratches.I love the lens cover that you simply slide up or down to uncover the lens and turn the camera on.  The camera is heavier than I expected, but it's very compact and feels sturdy.  I really appreciate that it comes with a wrist strap.  My camera is dark grey, which I find sleeker and more interesting than the standard silver.I also enjoy the extra features I didn't think I'd care about, like the smile detector and the scrapbook creator.  The smile detector doesn't capture the most natural smiles because there's a delay while you wait for it to detect a smile, but it's really neat technology and fun to experiment with.  And I've actually used the scrapbook feature, which easily creates a scrapbook from your pictures with the style you select.  It's makes it more fun to share pictures on your camera with others.  There are many other features I appreciate too, like the Image Recognition, soft background setting, etc.The camera comes with a USB and multi A/V so you can share pictures on a tv screen, which is nice when you're sharing with a group.  And I love the battery charger.  It's much more portable than the old cord versions.I thought seriously about getting something less expensive, but I'm really happy with this purchase.  I can't think of a single complaint. The technology and touchscreen are worth the upgrade.

They are all sizes and occur when the flash goes off (usually about 3 spots per picture).  It makes the photos ugly and useless.  There is an actual area in the troubleshooting section of the manual which states the spots are a result of the camera trying to reflecting off particles in the air and is normal.  However I have never seen spots like these from any camera.  There is nothing you can do with it.Additional things, this camera chews through batteries.It is a Sony camera which means it uses a Sony only cable from the camera to a computer.

Having the DCS-N1 which was also a good camera but tended to take blurry pictures from time to time this T700 has been an improvement for me.  The T700 is fully automated which makes it great for people like me who just want to point and shoot and do it quickly.  The problem I have is it is smooth metal all around on this camera.  While it looks stylish, clean and expensive it makes for a slippery smooth casing that is sharp on the edges.  Sliding the front cover down can be clumsy at times because there is no grip point.  It does slide smoothly when it goes.  On the revers side there is an area on the right side that is ribbed which is great for gripping with your right hand/thumb.  I almost wish there was just one rib like this on the front so I can slide the front cover up and down easier. Even so, with the ribbed edge the camera is difficult to use with one hand.  It can be done but it is difficult and has an unnatural feel.  This next issue is a problem and at the same time isn't - my left index finger sometimes covers the lens. You would think this is a problem but it isn't.  Why?  When you take pictures with this camera you look at the nice 3.5 inch touch screen.  There is no viewfinder.  The result: If you see a finger blocking the picture in the 3.5\" screen then you know it is in the way - so you move it.  It just tends to end up there because the lens is up high on the top right hand side of the camera (as if you were looking at the front of the camera).  The 3.5 inch screen is beautiful!  Showing your pictures to others is a pleasure.  However, the included stylus is the way to go - I find myself tapping the screen a couple of times when using my finger as it is not as accurate as the stylus.  I thought this camera recorded video in HD (780p) like the T500 - it does not.  Too bad because that would have been nice seeing this is the improved T700 over the T500 - right?  The T700 will project 1080i HD images/pictures with the supplied cables or the OPTIONAL cradle.  Why did they give the cradle with the T500 and not the T700?  Why, why I ask??  The cradle is an additional $80 with shipping if you are lucky enough to find one. The CSS-HD2 cradle like many cradles works with many different types of Sony cameras so it sells out quickly.  Now Sony has just come out with the DSC-G3 which has all of the features the T700 has but includes WiFi and a better design.  I like this camera and so does my wife.  She likes that is is small and takes quick pictures - so do I.  If you can get over the issues that I listed above you have a great 10MP camera that should last for many years.", "Date": "January 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "T-700", "Author": "Iuri K.

I don't like viewfinder's so this camera is great because it's all display screen and mostly no buttons which I like. The 10.1 mexapixel while I don't necessary need it,I do still enjoy it because of all the detail in the picture I get without having to be that close. It comes with some great photo software that makes it easy for me to upload my pictures to my computer and view them immediately. And the software is also very useful in uploading them to the internet easily too. However I do kind of miss my last camera, canon powershot 770 but it had a few similarities like the display size and my new sony has some upgrades that makes it a little easier on the switch.Overall i would say go for it! It's a pretty great camera and I'm sure you'll love it. I spent $399 on this camera and I think it was worth it. It has some great features and I don't really have any complaints as of yet.", "Date": "October 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great except for ergonomics", "Author": "Esteban Coupier", "ReviewID": "R21ZH0IVF3WTM0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Great camera except for a tendency to obscure the lens with fingers of your left hand.", "Date": "November 16, 2008"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "La99Hiccup", "ReviewID": "R3LU5ZUKR62RE1", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera in January, and have regretted it ever since.  Everything is worked via touchscreen, which is great for my iPhone, but with this camera, it means that real time and effort is required to change picture settings.  This is worst when it comes to video.  With my old T-100 (which I loved) you could flip a switch and be instantly in video mode.  With the T-700, you need to turn the camera on, then start working the touch screen to get there.  What this means is that you can no longer start recording with just a moments notice, it's now a process.  The video quality also seems much worse than my old T-100.  The same is true with picture settings; both hands are required to change them, so there is no longer that freedom to just flip the front down and start shooting.  Perhaps most frustrating of all is that you can no longer opt to turn the flash on (although you can turn it off).  The flash is only available if the camera detects that a flash is needed.  This means that when there is a backlight that you'd like the flash to offset, you need to change the photo type to \"low light\" so that the flash will kick in.  How lame.I would've given this camera two stars, but for the worst feature.  When you try to review your photos, you (well, I) get a message that says \"processing images\".  It takes about 10-12 seconds to get to the photos (it should take 1).  This used to happen occasionally but now happens to me almost every time.It does take pictures, so it's not completly worthless, but I won't be buying a Sony Cybershot next time around. - Ryan", "Date": "June 21, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very nice small camera", "Author": "B.

I returned it and got a Canon. The touchscreen and the features are really cool, but the image quality was terrible. I could not believe Sony marketed this camera. I even went to a store to try another one, thinking it was just a defective item, but it wasn't. You can tell from the LCD screen that the image quality is bad. Please try it and compare with other brands or the Sony DSC-W150 before buying.On auto mode, it is quite inconsistent, sometimes shooting with 800 ISO and ruining the picture. On manual/program it is more consistent, of course, but the pictures are grainy and reddish. It's a waste of megapixels.I compared this camera with an old 3MP Cyber-shoot I had, both indoors and outdoors with a tripod and the same settings. The old 3MP camera beat this camera, hands down.I cannot believe the positive reviews either. Maybe CNET gives a hint: \"DSC-T700  will satisfy those who like showing off their pictures as much as they like taking them.\" I would add: \"and those who never look at the pictures they are taking.\"", "Date": "February 13, 2009"}, {"Title": "Very Disappointed", "Author": "Donald E.

I tried several times with all types of settings and could never get a decent indoor shot with or without the flash. Pictures looked very washed out and grainey. Outdoor shots were much better but nothing all that great. I returned the camera to the store the next day and exchanged it for a Canon G10 and I'm very well pleased with it.
