Sundaram", "ReviewID": "R4OYM3IP6YKK4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Here's the thing - this camera does NOT COME with a memory card.  So when you pull it out of the package - there are 2 batteries and you can take 1 (YES - ONE) picture.  For novices - this means you must also buy an SD card - which granted is about $1 / per 1 GB (I bought an 8GB card here on Amazon).  I think this is because \"memory size\" is a personal choice and since it effects overall price I sort of understand why the camera comes without... But my point is that it doesn't exactly \"work\" out of the box.  However, the camera, once I got a SD card, works really well.  My 5 year old is the primary user - it seems to take great pictures for her - very easily.  And the 5x zoom is great for really close up stuff that kids like.  So overall, good camera, but you need 2 purchases - the camera and an SD card.", "Date": "January 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Came in time for Christmas!!", "Author": "Lil Angel", "ReviewID": "R2MRQGWPYSRR1Z", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this item to give as a gift for Christmas.

I noted during purchase that Kodak was not going to support the camera anymore.  I assumed that meant they wouldn't be updating the software.  So I happily bought the camera.  I have since found out that not only is Kodak not going to upgrade the software, they have completely pulled the software off the web.  They do apologize for any inconvenience.  There are a few sites that say they have the software, I tried 3 of them, the software doesn't work, and others want to sell you somthing else at a price.  Ergo, what would have been a great little camera for my wife is almost useless. Extricating pictures from the camera is a pain, and not somthing my wife will ever want to learn to do. As well since buying it 3 weeks ago the price has dropped almost in half.  Should tell you somthing.
