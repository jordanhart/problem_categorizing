{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Very good camera", "Author": "N. Buchheit", "ReviewID": "R1TCW55S6SGXDA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had the Olympus VR-340 for just over a month now, and used it quite heavily, as I was traveling overseas for 4 weeks of that time. Here are my thoughts, as a regular guy who likes to take good pictures, but is far from a camera buff.Size:The VR-340 is on the big end of point-and-shoot cameras, at least as far as I could tell. It doesn't look that different until you hold another camera up to it though, at which point you can really see the difference. It seems to me that its thickness is the biggest difference. Still fits in a pocket great though, so don't worry about that. It also fits perfectly into the Lowepro Apex 20 AW -Black, if you're looking for a case.Zoom:This is where the camera's extra size really pays off. I used a camera with 5x optical zoom for years, and that still seems to be the general standard. 10x is a HUGE difference. Well worth the extra money, even if you're just getting the camera for vacation. You'll be amazed how often you want to take a picture of something that's too far away for a camera with 5x zoom to pull it off without the picture getting grainy. I also really like the trigger zoom system on this camera (the zoom control is a little trigger surrounding the shutter button, so you just use the same finger as you use to take the picture itself). Once in a while, the trigger gets caught a bit on the edge of my pocket when I pull the camera out, but I don't think it's bad enough to break the trigger. My previous camera was an Olympus and had the same system, and I slid it in and out of my pocket for 4 years with no problems.Picture Quality:I'm pretty pleased with the picture quality. 16 megapixels is a ridiculous amount. I honestly can't imagine the average person could tell the difference between 16 and 8 or something on normal pictures. That said, if you can have more, why not? It at least opens up the option of blowing your photos up larger. My only real complaint about this camera is that I've had some problems taking pictures without some blurring. I've tried fooling with the shutter speed, flash, etc., and the problem occurs very rarely. But when it does, it's pretty annoying (hence 4 stars instead of 5). It's not like I'm jerking the camera all over the place when I take the photos either. When the problem occurs, it occurs even if I prop my elbows on a table to keep my hands steady. The only shaking would be from my heartbeat, which is fairly tough to control.... Maybe there's a way to fix the problem with the settings - I just haven't found it yet. With that caveat, I've been very pleased with the picture quality.Features:I'm a big fan of the features on the camera, though I really don't use them all. Very easy to adjust the ISO, white balance, flash, etc. if you want to, or just let the camera figure out the scene and make the necessary adjustments for you. I found the camera did a very good job generally of identifying the type of photo being taken and adjusting the settings accordingly. I tried the \"Beauty\" setting, where you can allegedly fix portrait photos in the camera itself, but didn't really find it very helpful. The \"Scenes\" are great though - the \"Landscape\" one enhances blues and greens, \"Candlelight\" enhances yellows & oranges, \"Nighttime Landscape\" keeps the shutter open a bit longer to gather more light, etc. Big fan of those. I also really like the continuous/sequential setting. If you hold down the shutter on these settings, you can take a TON of sequential photos. The camera takes another photo every 0.5-1 second, depending on your SD card and how many megapixels you want each picture to be. I rigged it up with a rubberband and a small rubber bumper (like you stick to the inside of cabinets to prevent them from banging when you close them), left it on a stand, and took sequential photos of myself and my girlfriend, too. Pretty easy to do.Movie Quality:The VR-340 says it records movies in 720p. That seems about right. It's not as good as a dedicated video camera, so you shouldn't buy this for its video-recording capabilities. That said, the movies it does record are quite good for a point-and-shoot camera. The image is a bit jerky if you move the camera around very much while you record, but it's pretty good if you can hold it still. You can also choose whether to record sound with the video or not. Basically, I think this is an excellent feature on the camera, and it's more than enough for a tourist who wants to record the occasional video on vacation, but takes mostly still photos.In Sum:I'm pleased with the VR-340. It does everything I need it to and more. The videos and photos it takes are generally excellent, with the caveats that I struggled on occasion to get the shutter speed fast enough to take a non-blurry photo and the videos get a bit jerky if you move the camera around too much or too quickly. I would definitely buy this camera again. Shop around a bit. I think you'll see that every other camera-maker charges significantly more for a camera with this array of features. I don't pretend to know enough about cameras and photography to critique the finer points of the photo quality or anything, but for a regular person looking for a solid camera you can stick in your pocket, this is great.", "Date": "September 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great Camera", "Author": "AnonymousZ8200", "ReviewID": "R1QLS8U5NC1D9D", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this camera. Most point-and-shoot pictures come out great and operating it is intuitive. The different scene and filter settings are great.Scene settings* portrait - for portrait-style shots* landscape - slightly emphasizes blues and greens* night scene - for shooting illuminated night scenes at a slower shutter speed* night portrait - for shooting subjects with illuminated backgrounds* action - for fast-moving action shots without blurring* indoor - for shooting indoors* candle- for shooting in low-light settings (e.g., candlelight)* self-portrait - for taking a picture of yourself while holding the camera* sunset - slightly emphasizes the reds and yellows* fireworks - shoots fireworks at night with a slower shutter speed* cuisine - for still life photography* documents - for text* beach & snow - for snowing landscapes, mountains, and seascapes* pet - for animalsI am still getting used to to using the portrait, night, and fireworks scenes.  The portrait scene mode doesn't seem to do well indoors and the night and fireworks scenes have such a slow shutter speed that a slight movement gives the image tracers. The automatic setting takes great indoor pictures most of the time, but the pictures seem to come out better when I use the indoor scene option.The VR 340 also has a burst feature under the program auto setting, which is great for taking several action shots and sorting out the best ones later. When it is set on high speed, the flash doesn't take.  This makes taking indoor pictures using the burst a little challenging.  You can, however, use a flash in the single burst mode. Burst mode works well outdoors.Close-up pictures have amazingly crisp detail and the zoom is great.  The VR 340 is compact, light-weight, and easy to carry around.Fun stuff - this camera also has seven magic settings:* pop art - exaggerates the colors* pin-hole - gives a black fog-like circular border around the photo* fish eye - makes the image close-up in the center then tapers out* drawing - makes the image look like a coloring page* soft focus - softens the hard details in a picture; gives pictures a sort of angelic effect* punk - washes the image out with a pink and black contrast* sparkle - anything that shines is exaggerated with a twinkling effectAlthough many of these effects can be done with editing programs, it is kind of cool to see them beforehand.  The effect is also instant; what you see on the screen before you take the shot is what you get afterward.I have been disappointed with cameras before, but for it's size, weight, and price; this is a great camera if you want to take close-to-professional quality pictures just about anywhere and be creative too.", "Date": "May 21, 2012"}, {"Title": "Professional Looking Photos FIVE STARS!!!", "Author": "Fiddles", "ReviewID": "R3ABKPVU88337P", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'm not sure why this camera does not have many, many more 5 star reviews. I have been trying for years to find a point and shoot camera that is in a nice price range that took good pictures. I have purchased many and have returned many. I tried again as this Olympus model seemed to have what I wanted. I liked the fact that it had some playful features like the fisheye, soft focus, pinhole, etc. I have had a lot of fun playing around with those. But, even without those features I would have bought this camera and paid more for it. It takes the most beautiful, clear, professional looking photos. I've posted a few here on this Amazon review. Truthfully, the photos showing here speak volumes on the quality of photos produced from this camera. There are plenty of things to learn with the camera regarding its settings and whatnot. But, it did not take me long to learn the basics. Some of the other settings like 'beauty fix' I have not tried yet but am sure will be just an additional great feature to this camera. Honestly, I am tempted to buy another one just in case it gets discontinued. It's so hard to find a camera that does this well in this price range. I've paid several hundred dollars more on cameras in the past and received photos without quality this high. I'm impressed and it's about time.To add, the image stabilization is so good I can be moving around alot and the photo still comes out clear. I cannot say enough about this camera!", "Date": "July 16, 2012"}, {"Title": "I love this camera", "Author": "Mattinerie", "ReviewID": "R3Q0QFGQQTLSWK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I grew up a photographer. I had a darkroom in Junior High School and up until 15 years ago I shot 35mm.Since the digital revolution I have had 6 cameras - all pt n shoot w/ progressively more MPs. I mostly drop them or break the screen which renders them useless.This camera has all the features that I could possibly want:1- sturdy cover for the screen so it will not crack2- a wide angle lens to capture the WHOLE scene - and w/16mp I can always crop later3- a very adequate 10x zoom4- good in low light situations5- a battery that lasts forever and a meter on the screenNow to be fair- I hate flash and do not use it - It is not natural - I don't know anyone who has a instant bright light that comes from his forehead- but I haven't traveled that much. So the complaints that I read here about the flash or blurry indoor photos go in one ear and out the other because for me and my art, life is rarely sharp and clear.  If there is enough light to shoot @ 1/50th sec the shots are sharp.  For the shots I take in dark bars or @ night - the blur is part of the scene!In conclusion, I don't carry a dslr because of the bulk and $$, but this camera I can take out of my pocket and be ready to shoot before you can say Olympus.", "Date": "February 22, 2013"}, {"Title": "Beauty Fix works as advertised", "Author": "Return2Liberty", "ReviewID": "R8J1DOLA74CPP", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera because I wanted to be able to \"beautify\" photos, especially portraits, in the camera, not after I'd downloaded to my computer. The process is easy to use and does a good job smoothing wrinkles, whitening teeth and even enhancing eyes and smiles.Wrinkles are a fact of life as we get older. When we look at ourselves or others we overlook the flaws and imperfections. But the camera lens sees and shows all. I don't feel like I'm \"cheating\" by \"improving\" the original photo. Instead, I'm changing the image to the way I perceive the subject.The 10X optical zoom is amazing on a camera this size, and the preset functions are easy to use.I see the price has dropped FIFTY DOLLARS since I bought it. :-(I made a before and after picture to post here, but apparently photos aren't allowed.", "Date": "April 29, 2012"}, {"Title": "Poor flash picture quality", "Author": "Zephyrxc", "ReviewID": "R1SJZ70ODHE46M", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This camera has never taken a sharp indoor photo. The flash goes off, but the pictures are always blurred. In daylight, the camera works fine. Sent the unit back to manufacturer. They claimed unit was set to macro and sent it back to us. Camera is confirmed to not be on macro setting, and indoor pictures are still very poor.

In bright light the picture quality is very good, this isn't a DSLR camera and won't take pictures like one but for an affordable point and shoot it does a fine job.  The camera falls a bit short for outdoor shooting of objects at a distance in low light conditions (i.e. in the dark) but if you're close enough for the flash to be effective it does fine.  I haven't had any issues with indoor pictures like some of the previous reviewers have mentioned, the indoor pics have turned out just fine.We just got back from a week at Disney World and I bought this camera to take with us.  I also own a Canon PowerShot that costs more than twice as much as the Olympus.  The bright light photos taken with the Olympus are crisp and vivid, it greatly exceeded my expectations in that aspect.  I also really enjoy the HD video feature, keep in mind you can't zoom when shooting video with this camera and it also takes video in 720 resolution.  When shooting video the audio quality is acceptable for most applications.  If you want to be able to zoom or are looking for 1080 keep shopping for something else.  It only fell short in one area: shooting at night in low light conditions without the flash.  If you have a tripod it the pictures would turn out fine, but even the slightest shake will result in some blurring.  That's where the Canon really does a much better job.Overall I give it 4 stars, the camera offers many options and is hard to beat for the price.", "Date": "September 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Love my new Olympus VR340", "Author": "Barbara Bak", "ReviewID": "R3W0LLNZPDEY62", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Am super happy with this camera, I have several camera's ranging from very expensive with several lenses, tripods, filters etc to small SLR's this little guy takes the best photos, took photos of fireworks on the 4th, best I ever got, take lots of nature photos, great birds, a bumble bee in a flower, did I mention I really love it, never having had a digital camera before took me a while to get accustomed but now, its with me all the time.", "Date": "July 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for a small price", "Author": "Man of the West", "ReviewID": "R1P81TGYKV1M4R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am involved in real estate and use this camera to take many indoor photos of houses (kitchens, baths, special features, etc.).  The flash works well and my photos are very clear. There are several image sizes to choose from including 1280 x 960 which provides a very clear image and yet the photos are still easy to send via email. Many of the smaller point and shoot cameras lack this image size and require you to use either 640 x 480 (too blurry) or a larger size which results in large files which are difficult to send via email. The camera is very fast and starts instantly when you press the on button. Similarly, taking a photo is also very fast with no lag once you hit the shoot button. The images are fairly wide angle and not narrow and boxy. Most of the negative reviews of this camera seem to be from people who didn't read the instructions and/or didn't take the time to find which settings work best for their needs. After I played around with the settings and tried various combinations, I had no problems with blurry indoor photos which some have complained about. This is an inexpensive small camera and the performance is quite good for the price. I would recommend this camera to anyone who wants good photos but doesn't want to spend a lot of money. My only complaint is that it didn't come with a memory card and I had to provide my own.", "Date": "March 5, 2013"}, {"Title": "worst digital camera I've ever owned", "Author": "Leigh", "ReviewID": "R1BGQQDJDITAWW", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Sorry, I found this to be the worst digital camera I've ever owned. At the store I could scroll through menus but not take pix, so I didn't know what I was getting. It's a nice size and weight, and the controls are easy to navigate and do a good job of explaining what's what. Unfortunately the preset settings are almost always off. iAuto never works correctly and the shots are often washed out or too dark. Trying to choose a scene mode is frustrating; it's a point and shoot trial and error guessing game. On top of that, probably 60% of the photos come out blurred even if the camera is on a tripod. Photo sizes larger than VGA usually come out fuzzy too. Maybe it's just me, but I've never had this much trouble with a digital camera.", "Date": "March 16, 2013"}, {"Title": "Some trade offs, but a great camera", "Author": "D. Rapson \"geekacres\"", "ReviewID": "R30G2V9Z7B02W4", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I was recently at a gathering where I wanted to hand off my camera for someone to take my picture. They had difficulty with it, and so started the search for a simple camera that I would also enjoy.This Olympus has really fit the bill. One of the FIRST things I noticed with many point and shoots is that the optical zoom is often limited to 5x for entry level cameras. This Olympus has a 10x optical zoom that really just blew me away once I first got my hands on it. Standing at the edge of our porch, I took a picture of the same tree from wide open, to 5x, to 10x. Great zoom for such a compact camera. And the display on the back of the VR-340 is nice and clear, giving you a good representation of the picture you've taken.I did try the camera at an evening baseball game. In lower light, some of the action was blurred. I'm still running on automatic, so maybe with some tweaking, I can get better results.At the end of the day, I'm happy with the performance and feature set for the money I paid(less than a hundred). Of note, you do need to bring your own SD card to the party. That's fine by me, because I was assured of a Class 10 card since I bought it. Additionally, they say that the best camera is the one that's with you. While I love my DSLR, this compact point and shoot is easily pocketable and does a great job of capturing those moments.

When I took it out of the box, the shutter was partially open, which was my second sign, but I hoped that once I turned it on the shutter would be fine.  There was no plastic film over the LCD screen like most new cameras, but I thought maybe they just don't do that.  I plugged the camera in to charge the battery (it doesn't come charged at all) and waited.  While I waited, I loaded the disc and downloaded the software and the manual.  yes, you have to download the manual which tells you how to download the manual! kind of funny.  After the battery charged, I turned the camera on and was looking at the features on the menu before I realized that it wasn't my finger over the lens causing the blackness on the screen.  The shutter never opened.  It stayed in the same exact position, partially opened.  I thought maybe if I took a picture it would fix it.  Nope.  The shutter never opened.

It's small, light, and easy to use.  Picture quality is OK to good, perfectly acceptable for the price asked.  You get better than average zoom range and nice wide angle.  The settings are basic compared to more expensive and sophisticated P&S; cameras, but then you did not pay $200-300 for this camera, but less than $100, so fair enough.The camera has more basic features compared to it's expensive brethren, the auto focus sometimes \"hunts\" and can't find focus, but is fine in most situations.  There are a few nifty features that people have come to expect in this type of P&S; camera (auto mode, face detection, very basic image stabilization, effects, etc.). All in all, it has everything most people will need for a cheap \"point and shoot\" compact camera.One thing I have not seen mentioned is that it comes with free software that is easily worth $20-30 in itself. The \"ib\" software handles your basic photo workflow, loading images from your camera, tagging them, and organizing them.  It supports editing, slideshows, video, \"Cinemas\" --videos (with music) made from your photos, ordering photo books and prints, and so on.  Some features work only with Olympus cameras, but most work with any images from any camera.  If you do not already have software for working with your photos, this software is surprisingly good.  It takes a little time to learn, but is basically well thought out and gets the job done. It is actually much better than most \"free\" software of this type that I have seen.  I could easily see myself using it with my other cameras (it will automatically load images from SD cards and most cameras once installed, so don't install if you already have a package you like) on PC's where I do not have my expensive photo software licensed and installed.Also included is Olympus Viewer 2, a more basic editing application and upload software package.  It is also decent. Both support Flickr, YouTube, and Facebook.  You get an A/C adapter and USB cable which connect to the camera and the battery charges inside the camera, no stand-alone battery charger.The camera feels like a budget camera (plastic construction), and the controls are basic.  But it handles well and everything works fine.  Images are decent.  Price is right.  Software included is a nice bonus.  Overall it is a good value and I think most will be pleased.

(They are sent to the sent to dogs' families at least once a day if not more often). I have 2 so if the battery needs charging, I don't miss any cuteness.The one design flaw on this camera, in my opinion, was that the door to the battery/memory compartment is plastic, and flimsy, and the pressure from the sim card or battery can cause it to bow, sometimes causing the camera to turn itself off, reset, or malfunction.I learned to take pictures holding it shut with my thumb.Only recently, I realized that the fault may be mine. The battery is held in place by a little plastic catch. The sim card, although it does not have a visible catch, WILL lock in place if one pushes it gently down. Just push down carefully and you can hear a little click.Now I don't know what to do with my thumb!Mainly posting in case anyone like me hurries and has this problem, which is really a non-problem.To see examples of the kinds of photo, you can always look at the Facebook page called Ravenhill. I use several settings, including party, sports, food, and pets.UPDATE 2014The two cameras sadly have somehow \"hit a wall\" and now break frequently. They are covered by manufacturer's warranty. One can send them in for repair.Notes on that process:1. If you pay to ship them, there are seperate steps you must take to be reimbursed, and it won't be soon.2. Once you send them, you should check on their progress. I sent one and it sat in some kind of limbo for over a month. Expecting it back any day for weeks, I went to check the status and it said \"More information needed\". They don't let you KNOW they need more information. Just let it sit, more or less forever.3. Each time, you have to send in proof of purchase. When I sent in one of the cameras for the third time, it got stuck in limbo waiting for proof of purchase, which I had already provided twice before. When I called on the phone and pointed this out, they said not to worry, and went on with the process.4. They don't really care about your experience. After sending a camera in 3 times, and it breaking again less than 24 hours after repair #2 and two days after repair #3, their \"solution\" continues to be the exact same form letter telling me to send it in for repairs....same one I used the first time. Mind you, this is happening with not one, but both cameras.Okay for about a year, then an assortment of issues, usually to do with lens retraction and/or the LCD screen.Cameras not bad, but the whole repair thing is a drag. They honor their warranty, but only seem to do the bare minimum. I think they just clean, and have never actually replaced any of the parts involved. I can hardly believe this thing about repairing the same camera over and over can be cost effective.This week, silver camera is dead and red camera has developed a black dot inside the lens housing, right near the center of the screen. since I really can't be without both, I am shooting around the black spot. Sometimes I can place it over black things, sometimes I can crop it. Crying, \"Out! Out, damned spot!\" has not worked. It's like a new challenge....as if it is not hard enough to get good pictures. Anyway, I really like the cameras. Will probably just buy a third one and hope for the best, because I have not really found anything comparable with similar reviews and features.", "Date": "February 26, 2014"}, {"Title": "Great camera for the money!", "Author": "Frena Gray-Davidson", "ReviewID": "R33E2XWDGYAWZA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I like the actual camera, tho. the instructions for using it are poor and often totally obscure.

Contacted Olympus they sent a new battery but the problem is still there. Not happy with the product. I've used it about three times, when I can use it. The problem now is that it's over the 30 days. They want me to send the camera for repairs. I don't want the camera. Asked if I could get a credit for a different camera. They will not do that... Contacted electronics basket, they are refusing to help me too. So, I guess it is buyer beware and poor customer service!!!

I have not figured out yet how to get a good focus on moving objects.  However, we took pictures from bumpy rides which came out in perfect focus.  The sparkle feature did not work nearly as well as we had hoped. When you use this feature, you must change the setting from \"auto\" to \"beauty\" and turn off the flash.
