{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Night Vision IR LED's Do Not Work Major Issue DEFECTIVE", "Author": "moto4sho", "ReviewID": "R2R0DCG2X4QGY5", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Let me first say that I had installed a Samsung SME-2220 system at my house prior to this install of the SDE-5001 system at my Mom's. My cameras are nearly identical and have glowing red IR LED's at night and have 50\" of clear night vision in total darkness. The SDE-5001 does not have enough power per channel to power the IR LED's, the result in about 5' of effective night vision rendering the system useless, nowhere near the advertised 50'. I bought this unit at Costco and figured it was just a defective DVR. When I went to exchange the DVR I did a test on the demo unit at Costco which to my disappointment it had the same issue, no or very weak IR LED's when covered. You should be able to see the red IR LED's glowing from 30' away, it's like having a flashlight with a weak battery, pointless.I called Samsung technical support and spoke with Troy and he was extremely impatient and rude both times I spoke with him, he repeatedly cut me off and was quick to dismiss my claim even though his underling admitted to me that the IR problem is a KNOWN ISSUE by Samsung and yet they continue to sell and ship these SDE-5001's, knowing they are defective. Basically Samsung doesn't care how many hours you spent in a hot attic, rolling in insulation, installing their defective product. I just hope this review saves someone the pain I went through only to have no recourse than to buy something else and rip this one out. Troy will tell you to send the DVR in for repair but the problem is a major design flaw and there is no fix for it, so your option is really return it and get something else or install a bunch of floodlights around your house and accept the barely working night vision.Poor customer service and all around shady business in my opinion.Update 11/30/12 - I finally got in touch with Samsung Corp Engineering and sent them pictures of the grainy night vision. They were unaware of the issue, they agreed it was a defect, there is NO fix for it, yet they continue to sell them.", "Date": "September 27, 2012"}, {"Title": "Great for the money.", "Author": "M.

I saw this system at Amazon and Costco and told my friend to give it a try. It took us four hours to install all eight cameras and program the DVR. I loved the easy Cat5 wiring setup. It will send power and analog video 600 feet vs 330 feet for real PoE digital video. The DVR software GUI was user friendly. Good color analog video for the money. The cameras are $120 each so you are getting the 1TB DVR for free. If you want crystal clear digital megapixel video then break out your checkbook.

Fortunately, I had planned ahead when the house was being built and ran Cat5E cabling throughout the house and left cabling for future cameras.  I wanted to find a solution that had PoE cameras so that I could use this type of cabling and not worry about local power to each of the cameras or deal with special (perhaps, legacy/old) camera cabling.  I recently installed this solution and the SEB-1005R outdoor cameras seem very solid.  They have a nice metal casing.  My only complaint is that the gray cable comes out the back of the unit and is exposed.  I would have definitely preferred for the cable to be hidden in the mounting bracket.  This would not only help with further protection against the elements, but also more protection against possible vandalism.  I ended up mounting a white all weather junction box next to the cameras so that my Cat5E house cabling would come in behind the box and then the camera cable would enter from the side.  So, I have about 3-4 inches of exposed cabling.  This provides a fairly clean look, plus the camera connector is further protected by being inside the box.  The SED-1001R cameras are sharp looking, but I'm not a fan on how the cable comes out either.  I also mounted a junction box next to it to manage the cabling so that there wasn't much that was exposed.  I would have really love if Samsung sold mounting bracket accessories (or included them in the package) that would have provided the perfect OEM solution for hiding these cables.  I would have bought them and gladly paid a modest upgrade charge.  Even so, I picked up some parts at my local home improvement store to complete the install (single gang outdoor, all-weather box and cover, and caulking for each camera).  My outdoor cameras are high, up under the roof eaves and I also have some on my front porch up high.It has been noted in a few reviews that the DVR fan is loud.  It surely isn't quiet, but I would compare it to the same level of noise that I have with my DirecTV DVR.  Plus, the unit is kept in my basement, so I'm not around it all the time to be bothered by it.Soltech is a great Amazon partner and you can actually swap out cameras for a minimal charge.  For example, I didn't need four indoor and four outdoor cameras; I needed two indoors and six outdoor cameras.  They were fantastic and was very fast in shipping my order.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Some Local SDE-5001 configuration tips~~~~~~~~~~~~~~* Device- Camera: I turned off the unused channels.  Also, I gave each channel a user-friendly name (ie. garage, porch, etc).* Record- Event Record Duration: for events, I set a five second pre-event with post event time of one minute.  That way, with motion events, I'll see a few seconds before the item that triggered the event.- REC Quality & Resolution: I'm not an expert at this section.  Basically, you have three resolution options: CIF(S), 2CIF(M), and 4CIF(L); along with record rate of 1fps to 30fps; plus, record quality range of \"Level1 (Low)\" to \"Level8 (High).  The system has some internal formula limitation so if you have many cameras, you can't simply give them all the best options.  Right now, I have eight cameras and all have the resolution settings of \"4CIF(L)\".  The record rate is factored into the formula because I can only give three cameras \"9 fps\", four cameras the \"8 fps\" and the remaining two cameras have \"7 fps\".  I can adjust the record rate to a higher number, but I would then need to lower the resolution setting.  The record quality doesn't have any effect on the formula restriction, so I use the best on this field.  Even so, I'm happy with the images because I could get some good shots of an unknown car coming to my house and get some good profile information about any people that get out; but, their license plate isn't going to be sharp and I probably wouldn't be able to zoom in to check out any tattoo that may be on their forearm (this equipment wouldn't be used by the CSI team).  Regardless, I have been able to tweak these settings and get them to an acceptable point for me.  NOTE: obviously, the local monitor has the best picture while quality on the web browser and smartphone app aren't as good.* Event- Motion Detection: I enabled motion triggers for each of the cameras and you can adjust the sensitivity using a scale of 1-10.  Plus, you can set the motion region for each camera too.* Network- Mailing Service/SMTP: I set this up so that I can get alerts.  I'm mostly concerned about video loss and I will get an email if a camera goes offline (whether network/system failure or if someone were to cut a camera cable).  Comcast is my home provider so server setting is \"smtp.comcast.net\" and port is \"587\".  You must enable authentication with them and fill in your username and password.  For the sender field, I made up an email address from my personal domain (ie. homealert@MYDOMAIN.com).- Event: select the items for which you wish to receive alerts.  I selected Change P/W, Video Loss, HDD info, and Power on/off.  NOTE: the option to include the \"motion\" alerts is very cool.  Basically, if motion is detected, the system will send you an email with a screenshot attachment of the motion.  Keep in mind, that you may be overwhelmed with many messages if your motion detection threshold is set high.  For example, I originally set this up and was getting tons of messages because there were leaves blowing in my front yard.  I'm going to continue to make adjustments to the motion detection scale to see if I can get the right config for me.  I want to make sure that I capture people and cars going by, but ignore any of the small items.- Group: You have to \"Add\" a group (I called mine \"Alert\") and then make the selections (I selected the same as I had on the \"Events\" tab).- Recipient: \"Add\" a new recipient and click \"Apply\".  After you have completed all four of these pages, then you can go back to the \"SMTP\" tab and click the \"Test\" button to see if it works.  Also, you can unplug a camera cable to ensure that you get your \"video loss\" alert.  In addition to using an email address, you can also enter in the SMS address for your phone (ex. 10-digit-TN@vtext.com for Verizon Wireless cell phones).~~~~~~~~~~~~~~iPOLIS/smartphone app~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Reference: my phone is running version 2.2.2 although iPhone app store lists 2.2.1 as the current version.Here is some information that may help getting this working for you.  Please note that if you are going to access this from an Internet connection outside of your local network, then you will need to register the device at the Samsung iPOLIS website.* I created two \"Devices\" on my phone: one to use while I'm at home on my local/wireless network and one that I'm away (\"Home\" and \"Away\").  Initially, I was stuck that I could not connect to this device at home, but I realized that my phone was on my local network and the phone app was attempting to use Samsung's DDNS service which is not going to work unless I'm on a different network.1. \"Home\" profile (at my home while on my wireless network -- same IP network as Samsung system).* \"Name\": technically, you can use anything that you want in this field (I went with \"Home\").* Model: \"DVR\"* Host: local IP address to your Samsung DVR (most likey is 192.168.X.X or 10.0.0.X address -- it's part on your configuration).* RTSP PORT: \"4524\" (for reference, my system has TCP port range of 4520-4524 in its configuration)* ID: this is the ID that you use to locally log into your DVR.* Password: again, local password to your local DVR.2. \"Away\" profile (outside of my home coming in via Internet)* Name: technically, you can use anything that you want in this field (I went with \"Away\").* Model: \"DVR\"* Host: \"www DOT samsungipolis DOT com SLASH YOUR-PRODUCT-ID-NAME\".  This is a little confusing in their documentation.  You use your device's \"Product ID\" name (Settings>Network>DDNS>Product ID) and this same value should be used when you register your product at the iPOLIS website .  If you register with their site and you a different product ID name, then you won't be able to remotely access your DVR/video feed.* RTSP PORT: \"4524\" (for reference, my system has TCP port range of 4520-4524 in its configuration)* ID: this is one of the unclear parts... this is the local ID that you use to locally log into your DVR -- this may be different than your profile registration at the iPOLIS website.* Password: again, local password to your local DVR.NOTE: If you use a different login scheme with the online iPOLIS site, you actually don't use those credentials with this smartphone app.I installed the app on my phone and also on my wife's phone.  We both can use the app, but only one person can access the video feed at one time.  If I log into the app and she is viewing it, it gives me a warning that the admin account is currently in use and asks whether I want to proceed or not.  If I proceed, then it stops the video stream to her phone and my phone will start viewing the video feed.  This same behavior occurs when remotely accessing feed via browser too (next section).  The bottom line, is that the unit can only support one remote connection at one time.  This isn't a problem for us.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~IE access~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Once you register your device at the iPOLIS website, in addition to use the smartphone app, you can remotely access your system via any Internet connection via the Internet Explorer web browser.  Surprisingly, in addition to the video feeds, you can remotely reconfigure your device too.  Nearly all of the options are available via this UI.  This is really nice because there are a few times that I've wanted to make a change and I could do that outside of my home (note: the smartphone app is exclusively focused on video feed access, while IE gives you \"setup\" access too).  For example, you can rename cameras, change the recording quality and resolution, change your email alert configs, etc.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Summary~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Highlights:* iPOLIS mobile app (huge selling point for me!!)* PoE-enabled cameras (cabling is a snap)* Camera housing for SEB-1005R/outdoor is solid (very sturdy and seems that it should survive the outdoor elements)* Good/acceptable quality video (provides me with what I need)Lowlights:* Day time clarity isn't nearly as sharp as the sample images (most manufacturers/restaurants/everyone-else uses this technique so this isn't unexpected)* Night vision isn't good (this is acceptable to me for the cost savings compared to higher end products, plus, I have motion floodlights at my house)* Exposed cabling from cameras (there is about 3-4 inches of cabling that is exposed in my solution)Bottom line:Solid solution at a really good price.  If I wanted to spend more money, I could have had perhaps found the \"perfect\" solution, but it would have been much more expensive.  I've bought AXIS HD cameras for my work environment and obviously these HD cameras produce a much better image, but they also come with a premium price too.  For example, I have experience with the AXIS M3204 cameras, but two of these cameras are nearly the same as this entire Samsung solution.I'm really happy with this system.  The iPhone app is one of the best aspects because I can always remotely check in at the house.  I love the solution and can accept some of its limitations.  I've had this for about a month now and plan on posting a followup after the first full year.", "Date": "April 15, 2013"}, {"Title": "Good for standalone, or Samsung only setup", "Author": "Bryan Agee", "ReviewID": "R2TBKDHAIT2JPX", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This is a great device for just capturing video; the installation was quick, and it was turn-key.

Power over ethernet (PoE) is exactly what I was looking for, and to have a name brand supply a 16 channel system with 8 cameras for $949 seemed too good to be true.  I ended up purchasing an additional 2 SEB-1006R cameras (with audio) from Amazon, but I have had problems with audio on both of those (one is super quiet, and the other has a defective amplifier, as diagnosed by Samsung).  I will exchange these and be back in business.Cameras are super clear during the day.  The night time no light areas are pretty useless, but it is that way with all camera systems.

I've had this running for two months now, and no major complaints. Some of the other reviews have addressed the strong and weak points well. I'll add a few notes that I haven't seen addressed yet:1. The eight cat-5 cables that come with the system use 5 braided wires per bundle. The wiring length wasn't enough to reach all camera locations, so I installed conduit and ran the additional wiring. If you can fit the entire RJ-45 jack from an existing ethernet cable through your conduit and connect with a female/female connector, then great. I ended up buying a 500 foot roll of cable in bulk because I needed to run several cat-5's per conduit. If this is your scenario, then consider hiring this out. If you do the connectors yourself, then be sure to get the correct connectors, an RJ-45 crimping tool, and a continuity tester. I use a WireMaster XR-2 LAN Cable Tester from Triplett. Do get this last device if you do your own crimping, as it'll save you a boatload of time and frustration. Only the left-most wires are used by the factory cables from Samsung. They are (from left to right): orange/white, orange, green, blue, blue/white. I went ahead and provided all 8 wires for the extensions for future compatibility with whatever. Important: if you are buying RJ-45 plugs, you have a choice of two types. There are braided-compatible and solid-compatible. Use braided-compatible if you are shortening your Samsung cables. Most cat-5 wires that you get in bulk will be solid-conductor. The difference in plugs is that the little metal pins that pierce the insulation are straight or v-shaped to make the best contact. These RJ-45 plugs are available at Fry's or Amazon. I got a good deal at Amazon.2. I have multiple fixed IP addresses, which made the iPolis app config a bit different. If this is your case and have control over your DNS, then you can assign a domain name for the IP address. Remember to edit your firewall/router config so that you allow through the TCP ports 4520-4524 to your machine. If you are able to tweak your own firewall, then remember to add \"DNS\" to your Cisco inside/outside (or DMZ/outside) entry so that your domain name reaches your device whether you are inside or oustide your network. If you have trouble, then create two hardwires iPolis configurations - one to the outside IP address, and one to the inside IP address.3. Some of the reviews may have been written before all the apps were published. I've got iPad, iPhone, and Android (Gingerbread) apps all running. When you configure the app, it's not really intuitive, but just select \"DVR\" as the type of device, and once it connects, the exact model SDE-5001N will auto-populate in the settings.4. The dome camera has a plastic screen. Don't expose this to rain even though it's weather-resistant. One of mine got rain run-off from the roof, and whatever chemicals got brought along by the run-off ended up etching splotches into the dome. I cannibalized one of my other domes to replace. The dome cameras in particular don't throw infrared very far, and in fact, the infrared LED's are visible as subtle internal reflections in the night shots. What I've done is to add motion-sensitive lighting to brighten things up. If you don't have power where you need the lighting, check out some recently released products such as a solar-powered 60-LED motion-sensitive light that's easily installed next to your dome. It has a 10 foot wire from the solar panel to the light, so you can connect the panel to a roof or outside wall.Final note if Samsung engineering is reading this: please release some optional compatible cameras that have optical zoom and have remote pan/tilt/zoom capability.", "Date": "May 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Didn't work out of the box", "Author": "alex", "ReviewID": "R34UMZ4TQV8GF0", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I got it working now. The reality show continues.Apparently, as someone commented on the YouTube review for this system, \"A bunch of units recently shipped to the US that have the default monitor setting as composite, so if you plug in your computer monitor it flashes back and forth between cameras and' doesn't show the menu no matter what you do with the mouse. The way to get around this is to press the DVR button and then rapidly in succession press FREEZE VIEW RETURN FREEZE VIEW RETURN and the thing will beep and reboot so the regular 16 channel screen and the mouse will work.\".I was not able to enter the menu. The DVR didn't respond to the remote or the front panel buttons. It was just cycling between the cameras that I got connected. This was the second unit I got, thought the first one was defective and returned it. Tried to reach the customer service, but they are not available weekends. So much for a behemoth company like Samsung! Talk about quality control! The COSTCO Concierge Service reps were unaware about this known issue, although the comments appeared on YouTube a month ago.Other considerations:1. 4 cameras out of 8 that come with the system are crappy plastic SED-1001R that look like PZT (Pan Zoom Tilt), but are NOT PZT.2. PZT Camera is not supported by this system.3. Both models of the cameras bundled with the system do not support sound. Need to buy extra mikes or add more expensive cameras if you want audio. This info is buried somewhere in the thick manual. No mention of that on the box or in the specs. What a bait and rip off!4. The mobile app fails to connect a few cameras out of the set now and then. Haven't experienced that with a system from another company.5. The daylight video is ok, but the nighttime is poor and grainy.6.

Not only is the overly large manual lacking in many steps, and full of quite irritating Engrish, but the image quality of the cameras is absolutely despicable. Hope I never have to take an image to the police, because even at full bright light and within 10' you can't make out a face. Nor can you make out straight lines even. The resolution is horrible! The 'sample' images shown in the searches I've seen are not from the included cameras. Beware!I've tried with several different lightening sources, distances, and angles, with both types of the cameras included.  The image is so bad that you can't make out the face of a person you know well.  The resolution is so bad you can't even make out the rafters on the ceiling of your home.  They all merge together into one large blur of shadow and light.  Good luck getting a license plate number, getting an image that could be usable by the police, or even identifying the model and make of a car.Set up of the unit was irritating, as the menus and the functions are not common sense.  Samsung has changed the names of the input fields, so you don't know what exactly they are asking for without having to translate their new name for the industry standard info titles.  The mobile app has been updated so many times that they stop supporting the previous versions of Android with every new update.  So low and behold my 1 year old phone will not run the mobile app, as I am now 'out of date'...What they also don't tell you is that you will need a temporary monitor just for the set up of the system.  This is not including your PC monitor.  You will need to hook up the DVR directly to a dedicated monitor to complete set up, before using it on your Network.One more thing;  The DVR is NOISY.  The fan on the HDD for the DVR is very loud.  You wont want this unit in a place of quite business, nor in your home, as it is ALWAYS running.I have not tried it in dark situations yet, but seeing the poor image quality, I don't have high hopes for it.This product is a toy.  Save your money and buy something worth while.Shame on you Samsung for putting out such a sub-par product.  I'll be returning my system, in exchange for a real security unit.See my image in full bright light, as I am standing between 6-8 feet from the camera.Update- Upon speaking with Samsung directly about the resolution of the cameras, They stated that the system is not designed to read licence plates, or be used to persecute post crime.  The system was designed to 'monitor only.'  When I told the rep about the poor quality and not being able to make out my own face at 6' from the camera, he was not surprised. The rep then told me I should send my concerns on to the Design Consultants to further the design of future models...  He also stated that the system was not designed to be used with a mobile device or viewed through a PC monitor.  Even hooking up the DVR to a stand alone monitor only slightly improves the resolution...Thanks for the wonderful product Samsung.", "Date": "December 25, 2012"}, {"Title": "Samsung - great job...", "Author": "David S.

I expected to spend days getting things to work, and instead I was done in 30 minutes.If you want to DIY something this complex, I highly recommend this unit.", "Date": "February 19, 2013"}, {"Title": "holds more than I thought it could", "Author": "Brandon Connell", "ReviewID": "R9N9S4MGYQF3E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Video is always large and takes up a lot of space on your hard drive.

We have satellite internet service and after many calls to support at Samsung found that these systems do not provide through satellite internet due to the static IP address needed. This is confirmed through our ISP provider. Even if there was access through satellite, the amount of live video streaming through the ISP would use up the available amount of data allowed (FAP)in a very short time. The cameras provide a beautiful view along our longest run of 300'. We are not returning this item as the quality is very nice and tech support has been good though lengthy, due in large part to my learning curve in the setup.

Chen", "ReviewID": "R9PYSARHMZTYF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this system from Costco. It took no time to hook up the basic setup (i.e., ethernet cable, cameras, etc.). The challenge came when I want to setup other nice features like e-mail notification, remote monitoring via IOS/Android app, web browser. I am a fairly savvy tech person who often maintain my home network and router. Yet, I found the instruction manual somewhat confusing. It gave some examples on how to set up virtual servers in a router, yet it was not very explicit about setting up the servers for all ports (e.g., 2540 - 2544). It talks about needing a SMTP server to send e-mail notification, yet it does not suggest that we can simply use SMTP server from Google or Yahoo. Once I realized that everything become quite clear. I had to spend a couple hours of my time working with Costco and Samsung tech support to figure those out.One of my issues was with Dynamic Domain Name Server (DDNS). Samsung provides a DDNS site iPOLIS where users can register its product. I followed the instruction to register my DVR and use the same product ID on the DVR unit itself. The DVR would simply not register to the DDNS. Samsung technician logged on to my computer reviewed the settings and could not resolve the issue. It turns out there is a length limit on the product ID. In the iPOLIs product registration page, it indicates 4-20 characters. My product ID had 20 characters, but it did not work. It worked when I made the product ID shorter.I do like the Android/IOS application that allows remote monitoring. During my test, I only had two cameras hooked up and they showed well with the application.Other than that initial setback, I think this product will work well. I just got the unit; hence, I cannot speak too much about its reliability.", "Date": "November 15, 2012"}, {"Title": "Pretty good security system", "Author": "Brandon L.", "ReviewID": "R2JR0HR414WL0A", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this for my boss to set up in his store.. some of the dome cameras were difficult to install, but the picture comes in very clear.  even though we ran some of the cameras well over 150' from the DVR.", "Date": "July 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "Way Too Easy!!!!", "Author": "Sheldon Smith", "ReviewID": "R2LA0OTEMAXVVL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This system was priced right and the ratings were good so I purchased it.
