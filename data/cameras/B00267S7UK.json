At the time of my D60 purchase, I was considering the D90, but after holding both in person, I chose the D60 for its the much smaller form factor, lighter weight, and much lower price tag. I have been largely happy with the D60, although its low-light performance while dramatically better than my old point-and-shoot camera still wasn't fantastic.Given the D5000 uses the same sensor and imaging sensor as the D90, but in a smaller lighter case, I decided to upgrade. And I must say I'm exceptionally pleased with the D5000.What is to like over the D60?1) Stunning Image Quality even in Low Light, without a tripod or fast lensThe D5000 takes exceptional pictures, especially in low-light and in challenging lighting scenarios. The D5000 is the first camera I've owned that can take a picture at night and capture everything (and in some cases more than) my eye sees. And this is in Automatic mode (flash off), without a tripod, using an average-speed (f3.5-f5.6) Nikon VR lens. Truly impressive.I went back and took the same night shots in the same settings with the same Nikon 16-85 VR lens and the results are noticeably better on the D5000 vs my D60. The difference between the D5000 and D60 is almost as dramatic (in low light) as the difference between my D60 and point-and-shoot camera. I've posted a few example images to illustrate.Images captured even at ISO 1600 have exceptional detail and very low noise. Even when you zoom to 100% the D5000 renders these tough shots beautifully.Highlights are controlled and not blown-out, while even low-contrast areas of the picture are captured.2) Ability to capture details in challenging light, automaticallyThe D5000's ability to capture all details of an image, even at night, with areas of highly contrasting lighting is even more impressive than it's low-light performance. As some have noted, the D5000 has a tendency to slightly underexpose these pictures to preserve detail. (The D90 tends to over-expose these shots, illustrating that the D5000 is not entirely a \"D90 in a small case\".)In one example (posted to the customer images), a night-shot of the famous Castro Street theater the D5000 captured the bright neon signs, architectural lighting of the facade, and even the mosaic tile and billboards in the very dimly-lit entry. All again in automatic mode, no tripod, F3.8 ISO 800. When I post the sample pictures they will tell the story better than I could ever describe.I can only think that this performance is related to a combination of improvements over the D5000: 11 autofocus points, 3D matrix metering, next-generation Active D-Lighting, latest Nikon EXPEED processor.3) No-compromises feature set that is still easy to use for the beginnerOne thing that annoyed me about the D60 was its lack of some features (eg. bracketing) intended to \"dumb the camera down\". The D5000 has every control you would ever want, yet its menu system remains extremely easy to use even for a beginner.Example features the D5000 offers that are not available on the D60:- RAW-JPG ability to select JPEG quality (Std,Basic,Fine)- bracketing (useful for HDR post-processing)and I'm sure there are many others I have missed.The D5000 also includes a number of additional SCENE modes (a total of 19) for the beginner used to point-and-shoot simplicity. Everything from Night Landscape, Sunset, Food, Pet Portrait, Sports, and more.4) Useful Live View and Vari-Angle Display for those hard-to-reach shotsA first for Nikon, the D5000 includes a \"vari-angle\" articulated LCD. Despite the specs on paper (230,000 pixels vs the 920,000 pixels on the D90) the screen quality is outstanding - very bright and easy to see even in sunshine.Using the Live View mode, you can take pictures in hard-to-reach angles such as above a crowd, or looking up from a low angle, or taking a self-portrait. What doesn't work so well in Nikon's implementation is that the hinge is on the bottom of the camera, so if you're using a tripod your choices are limited.New to the D5000 LiveView (not on the D90) is subject tracking, which keeps focus on a moving subject within the frame.As others have pointed out, the D5000 LiveView autofocus performance is very slow. The more that I have used it, I must say that LiveView performance is probably  worse than your point-and-shoot camera. Some other owners on the Nikon forums have reported complete failure of LiveView autofocus, although on my D5000 it works.As it is, I compose 99% of my shots in the viewfinder, which gives you the super-fast response of a DSLR in the first place. For me the ability to use LiveView in hard-to-reach situations is a nice feature.What could be improved?- Well, first of all, the video is more of a marketing idea - the sound is monoral, you can't change auto-focus once you start recording, and the video has the infamous \"jelly effect\" when moving from side to side- Although the case is much smaller than the D90, it's still over 1/4\" taller than my D60, and doesn't feel nearly as comfortable in my hands.- The tilting screen is great, but the bottom-hinge design is of limited effectiveness when using a tripod.- Live View autofocus is very slow for a D-SLR (even worse in some situations than a compact digital camera)- Auto White Balance just doesn't get it right with certain lighting. But it's easy enough to correct with a custom white balance (if you have the time when taking the shot) or post-processing the RAW image. I just don't understand why my $300 Canon SD870 does auto-white balance so much better.All in all, however, the outstanding image quality especially in low-light, and features offset the very minor areas that could be improved. For that, the D5000 gets my 5-star vote.", "Date": "May 23, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome performance on a lightweight package.", "Author": "A. Ed \"C\u00e9sar Lillo de Iquique\"", "ReviewID": "R1FNP6JQXHGLO3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got this camera back on July, its serial number is inside the range of the recall. But mine havent failed yet after 2 months of full time use.So I just wont send it to repair until it fails, crossing fingers here though. Anyway if it ever presents a problem I will just send it to Nikon since it has full warranty and Nikon's policies are to repair the unit no matter the time or when it fails, could be a lot of time, they will repair it fast for free.Ok now to performance, this camera performs as good as the D300 or D90 step up brothers IQ wise. High ISO performance is top notch, a few reviews over the net show that it has less noise than D300.This little consumer grade camera will do just about everything than other more expensive DSLR's. Like full manual settings, high exposure shots, D-Lighting, in camera editing, etc, etc.The little screen is just perfect, the size and weight too. The menu is user friendly, everything it has looks like a true 2009 model. 5 stars, cant find a flaw.This camera lacks an integrated autofocus motor, but that feature is for use of older lenses and some exotic ones. So it has 87 variety of Nikon and aftermarket lenses to choose from,that is one of the reasons I bought this camera, saving money discarding a feature that I wont ever use since Iam new to phootgraphy and Iam just starting making my own lens collection, with only new AF-S type of lenses that come with their autofocus motor. It doesnt have a top LCD display but I really dont like them, they look old. They are usefull, but really not a need.It has the video feature, wich it isnt as a camcorder quality but way better than a Cybershot, and its a DSLR so I wont go deeper about its video performance, wich anyway is HD 720p, for short clips is perfect.The 4FPS continuous shot is quite good, not professional but works pretty good, almost no different or noticeable than the 4.5FPS on the D90.The thing I like most, is the lightweight, coupled with my 70-300vr its ironic how light it is next to a ton of weight from other cameras with heavier lenses.Cant go wrong with this little camera. This is a great choice if is your first DSLR, or if its your 2nd body. Because if you are serious about photography, for more money u can get a more solid, body with more features, that are usefull for the professional photographer. But for everyone else, this 12.3 MP sensor is the same as the D300 or D90. The Image quality brings a tear to the eye, Period!", "Date": "September 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "Nikon D5000 vs Canon Rebel, keeping it short ...", "Author": "Ruslan Moskalenko \"Ruslan Moskalenko\"", "ReviewID": "R3BNDR0KVQJLL1", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you're looking at this camera, my guess is you've done your home work and figured out that if you want a good DSLR on a budget, your choice is pretty much down to D5000 or Rebel. I came to that conclusion fairly quickly but making that decision was not easy. On paper Canon had better specs for the price but both cameras looked close ...There are numerous reviews comparing those cameras. Most of them are long, detailed and come to the same conclusion - both cameras are good - not really helping much at the end. So here I'll try to keep it focused and tell about the key differences which helped me to set my mind.1. Low light shooting. Recently I went to a party and a friend of mine gave me his Rebel. What I didn't realize before is in order to autofocus the Rebel needs to pop up flash and fire it a few times. Of course, it's not at full power, but still it ruins everything because you can't take a picture without distracting people. You catch some interesting face, point, shoot and those few flashes totally distract the person. Nikon has a white lamp, it's enough to focus but most people won't get distracted. So if you plan to take pictures of people in party like set up - Nikon gives you an advantage. (well, to be fair you can get an external flash which has a lamp for autofocus assist, but we are talking about the cameras here)2. Tilting LCD. Rebel has bigger and better LCD. However, I'm not a paparazzi, but time to time i need to shoot over a line of people in front of me (parades, street performance, small crowded room etc). With the tilting LCD you can raise the camera above your head and still be able to frame the picture. I found that very useful and Nikon has an advantage.3. Extra preset modes. Probably like the most people I used to keep the dial on \"Auto\" most of the time. And it worked ok most of the time. But I never could quickly figure out how to take a picture of my daughter blowing birthday candles or perfect sunset or something white on white etc. So when I tried the extra \"Scene\" preset modes on Nikon, I was really surprised how much better can those pictures be comparing to the \"Auto\". Try them out and keep in mind Rebel doesn't have many of those modes.4. Feel. Nikon has very solid feel in your hands. Maybe it's subjective, but I do like this feeling.So overall, Rebel does have a lot of specs slightly better than Nikon. It's smaller, lighter, the screen is bigger and has better resolution, it has more megapixels. Yes, it's all nice to have but this is a choice between good and even better. However Nikon offers some things Rebel just doesn't have (see above). So I bought Nikon and feel happy about it.A few side notes. The cameras are getting better and better and in a couple years you'll be able to buy a much better camera for the same price. The lenses and flashes on the other side are not changing much and hold value really well. So if you have a choice, try to buy the best lense (and for an expensive lense don't forget to buy a protective filter) and flash you can afford and maybe save some money on the body and upgrade it in a couple years if some new cool technology pops up.Hopefully my review will help you to decide one way or another.", "Date": "December 30, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome!!", "Author": "Contributing Author", "ReviewID": "R35W5LEKVYRSRI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I did a lot of research before I decided to go with D5000 - including going to BestBuy and other camera stores and handling the camera to make sure it feels right.  In the end I got the best deal through Amazon (even though a D5000 kit at Costco had an unbelievable deal). I choose not to buy a kit because I wanted specific lenses with the camera.  I wanted one lens that I can travel with without the need to change lenses and another that I can use primarily in doors in low light conditions.  I got the Sigma 18-250mm f/3.5-6.3 DC OS HSM IF Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and Nikon 35mm f/1.8G AF-S DX Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras lenses.  I also got a Nikon SB-600 Speedlight Flash for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras and an Eye-Fi 4GB Pro SDHC Wireless Flash Memory Card EYE-FI-4PC to wirelessly upload pictures to my laptop (D5000 has built in support for Eye-Fi SDHC cards).  Last week Eye-Fi came out with Eye-Fi 8GB Pro X2 SDHC Class 6 Wireless Flash Memory Card EYE-FI-8PC that has more features and almost the same price (bummer!). I also got UV filters for both lens to protect the expensive lens glass.The cameras I compared before buying were, Nikon D90, D60, Canon Rebel iTL, xTi, etc.I have used it for two weeks now with great results.  Camera is very easy to use, I still have not looked through the manual and have been able to find advance setting easily.  The auto-focus with both the lenses is very fast (faster if using the view-port than using LiveView).  I still have not been able to find a camera case that I feel good with - that is compact enough to easily carry around and I can get my essential accessories in.One big factor for me for selecting this camera was the swivel lens.  Being a big guy, I run into scenarios where I do not have clear line of sight to the subject I am capturing and have always wanted the ability to move the camera higher or away from my body to take great shots and the swivel LCD does a great job at it.  My tipod mount has not had any problem with restricting the swivel movement, but I have seen it at a store, where the tripod mount was huge and restricted the LCD movement.Again - overall highly recommended camera.", "Date": "January 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "D5000: for the budget-conscious intermediate/amature", "Author": "Zachary Wagner", "ReviewID": "R2O74JI0UXL9XI", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Having had the D5000 for a few months now, and having used it with a few different lenses, I figured I'd better chime in here, in hopes of pushing this one's rating just a bit higher.  It's certainly deserving.  One of the reasons this camera got a bunch of bad reviews all over the place at first was because of the recall.  Definitely a bummer.  But by the time I received mine, the problem had been dealt with, and I received a perfectly working model.  So how is it?In a word: fantastic.  I've owned one other dSLR in my life, and it was a Canon, and it was a while ago.  Needless to say, this was a HUGE step up for me.In getting truly serious about my photography, this camera has been the tool I've dreamed of having for a long, long time.  It's fast, light, takes wonderful pictures, and is reasonably priced to boot.  The menu system is well laid out, and there's a very useful info button if you want the quick-and-dirty of what a particular setting does.  I've used this camera with Nikon, Sigma, and Tamron lenses, and with all of them it has just performed seamlessly.  Of course, now that I know everything there is to know about this camera, it only makes me want a D3X that much more.  But parting with 7k for a camera is more than a little crazy, especially at my level.So my parting advice is this: if you really, really know what you're doing, you'll probably be a little disappointed and somewhat limited by this camera.  While it does an admirable job at higher ISO's, it's no $7000 camera.  In fact it's no $3000 camera.  Meaning that you will see noise at the higher settings, plain and simple.But if you're not expecting miracles, then this little gem of a camera might just surprise you with a few.", "Date": "October 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great camera, but missing one main feature", "Author": "Girl In A Box", "ReviewID": "R1IGFNUN116SJA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This is a great little camera.  I was so excited to get it - it was really easy to use and has so many features to play with. I flipped through the manual in no time and was able to feel completely knowledgeable about it and comfortable with using it for the first time.  When I was considering buying it, I was also considering the D90.  I kept going back and forth trying to figure out which camera was for me and I chose the D5000 because of the cheaper price.  I have been getting into photography more and more and really wanted a second body (I also have the D50, which is also a great camera).  So this camera seemed like a good option before I started thinking about spending thousands of dollars on a professional camera.  I actually used the D5000 to shoot a professional job and it worked like a charm.  However, I recently bought a new lens that did not have the Auto Focus button on it, meaning, if your camera doesn't have the auto-focus motor built inside, then you are going to have to manually focus with these types of lenses.  I knew this when I bought the D5000 and wasn't concerned because I figured I'd stick with lenses that had the auto-focus button and since that was the wave of the future, why would I need old lenses?  Well, I was wrong, I needed this one particular lens and I was surprised when I was reminded that it wouldn't auto-focus with the D5000.  It would auto-focus on my D50, but the D5000 was so much faster and the most important functions for me were speed and focus.  So the lack of auto-focus motor is a deal breaker for me.  I am exchanging it tomorrow for a D90, which has all the features the D5000 has and more.  It is a semi-pro camera and has the in camera auto-focus monitor and very high ISO capabilities.  I will also be paying the $200 difference that I didn't want to pay in the first place, but at least I know I'll be happier with the D90.  Don't get me wrong, I am not giving the D5000 a bad review - I'm just saying, make sure you know what's missing.  If auto focus is at the top of your priority list for a wider selection of lenses, then don't get the D5000.  Spend the extra on the D90.  If you're looking for a camera that's super lightweight, easy to use, takes great pictures and has a million bells and whistles (not to mention the cool graphics on the LCD screen that I really will miss, but are really not necessary - just visual fun), then go for the D5000.", "Date": "March 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera for the beginner to advanced", "Author": "Tech Mologie \"TM\"", "ReviewID": "RJW3RYJ3W1P6J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just recently purchased the D5000 and have had this camera for over two months.  I've been searching for a digital SLR to replace my SLR (Nikon N90) and fill the gap from my point and shoot (Canon IS970). I have been doing photography as an amateur for 20 some years now and have to say that the D5000 fills what I need perfectly.  I was a bit perturbed about the reports in this forum about the problem with the Nikon and further still about support from Nikon in reporting the problem.  In the past I have not had any problems with Nikon products (maybe lucky?) and they have had great support from their dealers for any questions that I had. If you have a problem with a Nikon product, you have a wealth of choices in terms of support - you can go to a local Ritz or Penn Camera in the Mid-Atlantic if you are not satisfied otherwise. There are a couple of things I was surprised about:1) While I can use my older Nikon Lenses, they no longer work in AF.  You need the new lenses that support the new style of DSLR AF.2) You cannot use the older Flashes - it flashes too strongly for the CCDs/CMOSes and are not compatible with the new mounts. You will need to buy one specifically for these DSLRs.Either of the above is not a problem since purchases should be forward compatible from here on out...My buying thought process was the following:1) Quality pictures2) Quality build and company support3) Compatible with old lenses (to save money)4) Ease of use#1 was readily solved.  This camera is excellent in picture quality - I've been very satisfied with the pictures from high to low ISO with some understandable graininess at 3400 ISO. The CMOS sensor used in the D5000 is the same one as in the D90. Also, the 11 AF points are the same as the D90 and not the 3 point in the D60...  The build is excellent.  It is smaller than the D90, about as light as the D60, and feels solid. The past issue with the lockup is long done, I think.  I've taken about 2000 pictures so far and no lockups and on a single battery with the builtin flash (but not continuous - probably about 20% with flash). I had a bunch of old lenses from my N90 that I really wanted to save money with.  I can still use them but not with autofocus.  I went ahead and bought new lenses anyway except for my 75-300mm Tamron Zoom lens.  It's just a great form factor for that lens (light and small with a minimum barrel length of 2.5inches).  The camera is also incredibly easy to use - it reminds me of how easy my N50 was.  The learning curve on the N90 was a little steep which I suspect the D90 is as well.  I can use the D5000 as easily as I can use the Canon IS970, which I think says a lot - and without having to use the manual.  For getting the right depth of field using Aperture priority, I did need to look that up in the manual...I think the D90 is a great camera and there are more features to it than on the D5000, but the D5000 hit the right spot in what I needed - a really good DSLR that is easy to use, light, and give me enough options to take some serious photography when I want to.So 1,2,and 4 outweighed 3 - I could live with 3 since the only thing I lost was AF. Buy this camera and rememeber to buy a decent flash - if you are a beginner, you will run into the lens barrel shadow that all SLRs/DSLRs have with anything beyond an 18-50mm lens...", "Date": "February 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "Awesome for the money", "Author": "K.

Let's start there.  In the past, I've relied on point and shoots and cell phones to capture the moment so this giant leap into the D-SLR world was, for me, sailing into unchartered waters to put it mildly.  If you're looking for all the technical jargon and in-depth analysis of the various features, it ain't me Babe.  I do appreciate the efforts of the more learned and their comments/reviews which actually convinced me this D5000 was the best camera value out there and so far, that feeling hasn't been compromised.I got the camera and quickly viewed the accompanying DVD from the Nikon school which helped me understand the camera's capabilities along with the basics of how it operated.  The menu system is fairly straightforward and anyone with basic computer skills shouldn't have any problem in finding their way through the various modes although, at first, I found all the selections and options somewhat daunting so I left the main selector wheel on automatic and snapped off a few pictures to get a feel for the D5000.  The first thing I noticed was the speed and accuracy of the act with no worries about vibration or causing the pictures to blur.Taking clear photos of fast moving objects was another new experience that caused me to warm to the unit.  Through trial and error, mainly the latter, I've also learned the basic skills of zooming in, focusing, and using the various modes for sports action, twilight and a few other modes.  So, for a disinterested photo guy, the D5000 has delivered and actually made me want to search out more photo ops which was the purpose in getting this advanced (for me) camera in the first place.  I'm still trying to figure out the continuous photo mode where you're supposed to be able to take 3-4 pics in a row but that capability is buried somewhere in the various menu options which I'll sort out by reading the manual.A word about the actual choice of the camera over the competitors:  I elected to go with Nikon because of its name recognition, reputation for technical excellence and because of the various reviews I read prior to the purchase.  Maybe the other manufacturers are of similar, lesser or greater quality in this regard, but the Nikon name, to me, has been well worth the purchase price paid.  To me, it was sort of like buying a Toyota car over a Kia if you know what I mean?  At any rate, first time D-SLR buyers will be heartened to know that I made the plunge with the Nikon D-5000 and am glad I did with no buyer's remorse and the D5000 has my recommendation.", "Date": "December 14, 2010"}, {"Title": "Took my time looking for my first real DSLR", "Author": "W. Ivey", "ReviewID": "R3TT0IXQ2EQ7GK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I'd been thinking about moving up to a DSLR for over a year, and actively researching brands and models for about four months. I started out looking at the Canon offerings including the Rebel XSi, T1i and D50 then extended my search to the Nikon D5000 and D90 and also the Sony 4/3rds Alpha offerings. After reading a lot of reviews and comparing full-sized sample photos from each camera I concluded a number of things:1. I probably couldn't afford the lenses that would do justice to more than about 12 megapixels2. Nikon and Sony sample photos were the best. The Canon photos showed more aberration, possibly from the kit lens but it was hard to say3. The entry-level Sony models were just a bit too small for my hands and the range of lenses (I could afford) was somewhat limitedThat left the two Nikons. I liked the \"hand feel\" of the D90, and the much higher resolution of its LCD was really nice as was the top information LCD screen. Its only real drawbacks were weight and whether the high-res LCD was worth the extra money (which I could otherwise apply toward a lens). Then, too, the D5000 had a few features the D90 lacked - features I actually thought I could use. (Interval timer, in-camera image corrections, etc.) Since I didn't have any old Nikon lenses the internal focus motor in the D90 was not useful. And, while obviously lower-res, the D5000's LCD is quite adequate.So, I went with the D5000. Since I didn't want the usual kit lens I bought the body only and bought a Nikkor 35mm f1.8G prime lens initially. (My previous film camera was used mostly with a 50mm f1.4 Zeiss lens so the Nikkor was a reasonable replacement.) I then bought a refurbished Nikkor AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-105mm F/3.5-5.6G ED VR zoom lens (the kit lens for the D90, and a much better \"walking around\" lens than the D5000's kit lens in my opinion). I ended up spending a bit more, but I got the lenses I wanted (the 35mm is really sharp and is great for low-light work).So far, it has produced terrific photos. My previous digital cameras were various point-and-shoot compact models (some of them work very well, but the small sensors have their limits) and a Fuji S9000 (also a small sensor, but is rather DSLR-like otherwise and I did some good work with it). The first few photos I took (with the 35mm lens) really knocked my socks off - the sharpness was astonishing (and without tweaking the default settings). The out-of-the box settings aren't bad at all, and there is a selection of \"scene\" settings (some on the mode dial, some available through menus) to fine tune things. (You can modify or design your own scene settings as well.)To really get the full benefit of this camera be prepared to put in some time with at least the manual. I found the menus easy to navigate after a little exploring, but there are a lot of options you can adjust especially if you want the camera to do some of the kinds of processing you might otherwise do with after-the-fact software.Cons: Not many. I wish it had the LCD of the D90 (or Canon's T1i). I also wish Nikon included more software - you pay extra for the computer control software on the Nikon while Canon provides it for free (not a dealbreaker for me, I don't expect to really need it for the foreseeable future, but ...)Summary: It's a lot of bang for the buck, lots of features to play with, and it makes great pictures.

I've shot several thousand pictures of a variety of subjects: landscape, family, sports, portrait, still life. I upgraded from film SLRs and compact digitals. This is a whole new world. It took me a little time to get all the features and settings where I want them, but I've got the hang of it now.The D5000 is a compromise: it's the sensor from the D90 and a user interface similar to a compact digital. It's right for me, because I wanted better pictures than a compact, taken over a wider range of lighting and action than a compact is capable of. The dynamic range is a huge improvement: no more treading the fine line between blowing out the highlights on one end and losing everything to noise on the other (sometimes doing both at once).I intended on using the articulating screen for taking candid shots of people, but it doesn't work for two reasons: shutter lag and the time to autofocus. In live view, I took pictures of a stopwatch and measured the shutter lag at 0.6 seconds. That's with manual focus and exposure, so I don't see a way to get reduce it any farther. The source of the lag is the mirror flaps down and back up again before the pictures taken. It seems silly, but there's no way around it. At any rate, the delay is too long to capture the moment in street photography. Not in live view, looking through the viewfinder, the shutter lag is very low - too small to accurately measure this way.The other disadvantage to live view is the time it takes to autofocus. If the subject isn't stationary, you have to use manual focus, preset the focus (using either manual or the AEL button) and - this is important - put it in AF-C mode (Continuous Servo Autofocus), so the camera takes the picture BEFORE it decides that it's focused. That last part is casually mentioned in the manual, but without it the camera cranks back and forth on the focus and you get a picture of your subject's hind end as they leave your field of view.One more thing: since it won't trigger flash remotely, this may not be what you'd want for a studio camera. There are several ways to work around this: wired flash, Pocket Wizard, etc. but you'd cut yourself off from being able to fully use CLS. If you think you're going to get serious about studio photography, you probably don't want to set that limitation for yourself right off the bat.All in all, I still like the camera.

Currently, I am going to get rid of the D700, D300 and stick with this camera. I frankly have been influenced by ken rockwell, who has a deep understanding of how to take a good picture, and the influence of equipment on that process. It seems that Nikon sells much high-end and high-priced gear, and yes, if you are a National Geo photographer you can spend 8-30 thousand on equipment. But if you buy this D5000, your ability to take good pictures will not in the least be compromised. Well, OK, if you are shooting football from the 50 yard line, a 20 thousand $ set-up will give you a 5% advantage over this camera! Why so small for spending 50 times the money? Well, for one you get 12 megapixels and 90% of the controls of the $5,000 D3 series. For another, by the time the 20 k$ shooter's pictures get to a printer/web production, the difference is not even visible. Of course, this is a complex issue, but I stick with my words here.Why is this astounding fact true? IMO, Nikon knows they can make more money selling a cheaper camera to many more people.. So they take the technology they developed for the 5 k$ cameras and just put it in the 500 $ cameras. Why not? The sensor chips are already in production and cost Nikon only $10 apiece to make after the development cost is spent. Why should they spend another 100 million to make a lower quality sensor?

Gives a ghosty lense shadow at center-bottom of photo.  Flash works fine with 24-200mm range even when barral is fully extended at 200mm.-- Nikon D5000 is a not too heavy (only 560 gms).  Nikon 18-200mm is heavy (again 560 gms).  When this combination is around the neck, because of weight of the lense, it doesnt stay in place.  A user feels unsecure when constantly lense is pointed towards ground.  Also creeping of lense makes condition even worse.  Make sure to use 18mm LOCK more frequently.-- There is significant BARREL and PIN CUSHION distortation (In General: BENDING) acroos focal range.  After reading a lot of reviews, this came to my attantion and now I am observing it more frequently during photography practices.  THIS IS NOT A BIG DEAL.  Not a big deal unless someone photographs straight lines, architectural systems or buildings.  ---- Camera has inbuild correction menu, where this can be corrected.  Bending can also be corrected thru PhotoShop or other similar softwares, but can not be removed 100%.-- Focus ring has very small movement.  Average focusing distance is 4~6 inches.-- Lense uses 72mm filter.  They are not tough to find, but they are not widely used.  A buyer can easily find cheap filters (to start with) on Amazon.++ Camera is designed very well ergonomically.  Only person with bigger hands needs some adjustment time initially.  Overall very much satisfied with size and design.++ Lense is super sharp and focuses extremely quickly in average to bright light situations.  It has some lag when light is not sufficient.  AF illuminator is very handy in certain situations.  But keep in mind that AF illuminator can be disturbing for a close potrait shoots and for wild life photography.UPDATE:  Nikon has introduced Nikon D5100 with slightly higher price.

I spent one hour playing with the D5000 in LiveView and not once the camera managed to find the correct focus, it never ever focused on the subject inside the AF area. And it gets worse, the camera would tell you that it has achieved focus (the rectangle turns green) even if the image is utterly out of focus from corner to corner. The camera was tested under average light situations, such as what a journalist would encounter. I am not interested in the arguments that the camera Live View works only when it is on a tripod or in superbright sunlight (where the sun washes out the LCD screen anyway), that is just ridiculous non-sense.I have heard \"rumors\" about the LiveView failure online but I never in my wildest dreams imagined it would be such a complete failure, it is absolutely useless.The Canon Digital Rebel also offers LiveView but it also does a neat trick which allows you to lower the mirror for a fraction of a second and focus properly, it happens very fast and it works. It would have been extremely easy for Nikon to add such an important software feature, instead, they rendered the presence of a Vari-Angle LCD useless.The only reason I did not give it one star is because the D5000's chip is supposed to perform excelent under low-light conditions and you can still focus through the viewfinder, but, if LiveView is important to you, I strongly suggest you avoid the D5000 entirely and wait for a better model.More cons: low quality LCD resolution, the burst mode does not work as advertised, the menu is harder to navigate requiring sometimes double clicks, menu descriptions been cryptic, etc. It seems this may just be one of the worse Nikon DSLR ever produced.Update July 20th:Just as I predicted several months ago, this model was so poorly built that it prompted a recall. This week Nikon has sent thousands of letters to all Nikon D5000 owners announcing a mayor recall. Based on your serial number you may have to send your D5000 to be \"repaired\" for what they claim is a \"power issue\", even if your D5000 is working now send it anyway, it will probably brake soon so don't wait until that happens. (They do not mention they will fix the \"Live View\" issue). I am afraid there are SEVERAL other issues that won't get fixed so my advice is to RETURN IT and request a full refund!Note: In July 2009 Amazon was forced to temporarily suspend the sale of this model for a few days due to costumer complaints.

I charged the battery and proceeded to take several photos in the Auto mode to see how it would perform.I was not pleased with them.

The photos were acceptable, but just barely.I also own a 4MP Kodak DX6490 that I bought in 2003, so I took comparison photos of the same subject in the same lighting with both cameras.I am disappointed with the Nikon in that the comparison photos, side by side, seem to have a LOT of difference insofar as sharpness and clarity, with the advantage going to my eight year old Kodak.For instance.With my Kodak I took many a photo of the flowers in my garden and was very pleased with the details, even the veins in the leaves, that the Kodak showed.This seems to not be so with this Nikon. The photos look OK, but just \"OK\", and are nothing to write home about. Even setting this Nikon to take \"fine\" photos made no discernible difference.The videos this Nikon takes are excellent and are clean and clear, but I want a camera that takes above average photos, not movies.I will give this Nikon another week or so to see if I am at fault, but at this point I am inclined to send it back.I wonder if Nikon paid more attention to the 36X mega zoom lens and slipped up on the quality of the photos it takes?I, for one, do not want mega zoom...I want quality photos and so far this Nikon is not providing them.It is a shame that an 8 year old, 4MP Kodak can take photos that are visibly better than those I have gotten from this new Nikon. At least so far.On the plus? I love the fast lag time between photos and the bracketing option.Another plus is the quick touch button to put the Nikon into the Video mode.But for good, high quality and visibly sharp photos?

The built in flash always pops up in Auto mode; however, there is a way to turn it off (the Mode dial should be set to the \"lightning bolt\" icon with a slash through it).I have only used the AF-S 18-55 mm lens and have taken over a thousand photos at this setting: family, Christmas decorating and Christmas Eve family gift exchange, New Years party, & grandchildren.  All the photos have been good: clear detail and enlargable.  I shoot at the full 12.3 MP setting (large).  This allows for cropping with no grainy appearance.This was a much camera as I could afford, costing about $700 in the \"Kit\".  I wanted the Nikon D700, but could not afford it ($3,000 body only); however, the lenses and flash would work with the D700 when I am able to afford it.  Avoid the D300 (poor photo quality according to reviews).The D5000 uses SD cards & I use an 8 GB one.  Some grandkid motion is too fast for the auto-focus to follow; but with my previous Minolta DiImage A2 (long obsolete) could not catch that motion either.When my Minolta died, I tried some other D-SLRs: Kodak Z980, Canon PowerShot SX20 and SX120.
