Part of the reason was for the Leica lens...it's incredibly sharp.The camera is quite easy to use, and the controls are 'intuitive' once you have used them. Navigating through the menu is not intimidating or complicated, so no one needs to feel like they could not master this camera. In fact, I didn't even have to read the manual.Image quality and color rendition are quite surprisingly good for an 'economical' camera, and it adapts really well to low-light situations with it's extended ISO range.The camera reacts quickly when you turn it on, and the 'write-time' to the SD card is fast, so follow-up shots can be taken almost instantaneously.I highly recommend it with no reservations!", "Date": "June 1, 2008"}, {"Title": "You will not be dissappointed...", "Author": "J. Trimboli", "ReviewID": "R19NIZ6V84P17G", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am not a spontaneous buyer - I researched the heck out of small, point and shoot cameras. I told my wife I wanted it for her but I really wanted a camera that took good pictures in a multitude of situations, including low light and I wanted to carry it in a small case on my hip.I attended collage for graphic design and have above average experience with cameras but when it comes to buying a camera, I want the best value for the money. I visited multiple digital camera review sights but I ended up using [...] the most. I began with his best camera list under ultra-compact and narrowed it down. After I got it down to three based on features and price, I went out to the stores and tried them out.The Samsung L210 was eliminated because I had a hard time with the controls. This left the Canon Powershot SD750 and the Panasonic Lumix DMC-FS3. I was looking for the least expensive camera I could find. I walked into Circuit City and they had both these cameras. I went from one to the other and back again, using different settings, taking pictures and analyzing the cameras function and use. The FS3 won!!! It cost as much as the cheap looking Samsung L210 but was superior to the Canon Powershot SD750.I purchased a 4GB Kingston SDHC SD4 with it and it holds almost a thousand pictures at max setting. However, I did have some trouble. I went immediately on a trip and had little time to test my new toy. When I got there I was taking pictures but I threw the camera to my son, who asked to see it (in the Samsonite case of course). He began to receive an error indication a problem reading the card. I then noticed that I lost a bunch of pictures. I was very disappointed. I continued to lose pictures after testing the function and thought it might be related to throwing it or the SD card. I had my PDA there with an older smaller SD card so I swapped it out. I did not experience any more errors or picture loss again.Upon returning home I was disappointed that I had bought a huge 4GB card that did not seem to work with my camera. The owners manual recommended using the Panasonic SD cards so I bought one. A Panasonic 4GB SD High Capacity Class 6 Memory Card that works great. It cost more but it's so very fast - I believe that the speed issues with most digital cameras can be overcome with a good class 6 data card.The bottom line - buy it. You cannot go wrong. It has tons of features, takes great pictures and my favorite is the excellent indoor, low light pictures. The flash pictures are great also, very soft and even. All at a price you can't beat...

That camera was great especially for nightime/clubbing pictures so I was debating whether to repair or spend money to buy another one.  I'm glad I got the Lumix.  It's a lot smaller so I can fit it into my jeans pockets when I hit the town.  The intelligent mode is perfect for someone like me who doesn't want to fiddle with settings.  There are a ton of features.  I especially like the facial focus recognition.  The quality of the pictures are awesome especially for a smaller camera.  You can attribute that to the Panasonic's Leica lens.  There are probably other cameras with better fluff but go with the best quality lens in the Lumix and you won't be disappointed.", "Date": "July 30, 2008"}, {"Title": "A pretty decent deal", "Author": "Brian Watson \"Biscuit\"", "ReviewID": "R1F9QLQ9VMK078", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had several criteria for chosing a camera. There are so many choices nowadays :)1. Decent pictures, always a plus with a camera2. Movie mode, high quality3. 720p support on movie4. Able to record up to 1 hour continously.This camera was a compromise. But I am very happy with the compromise. I use AVI files at home, with Windows Media Center. I do not use iTunes, I do not use a Mac. Unfortunately, nowadays, very few cameras support AVI format files directly. I was concerned about Motion JPEG with the movie mode.So, I ran some tests. Pictures look great. There is a little noise in the background but that only appeared when a flash was not used in slightly low light. Pictures with flash look great.Facial focus was great. Such a difference from my last camera (Casio Exilim). That camera was awful at selecting the target for autofocus, so we'd get a lot of pictures with blurry faces but some very sharp leaves in the background.This camera, on the other hand, seems to do a great job at picking the correct object. I've only been using it a day or so, maybe my opinion will change after a while, but it all looks good right now.Video mode: This is one of my biggest things for me as all my digital cameras have been used to record home movie snips. The previous camera used MPEG4 streams in AVI format which was very convenient for me. That camera could record up to 2 hours continuously (2GB file).This camera, however, can only record about 19 minutes in 2GB. This is a significantly higher data rate than the old one. Also, it's using MJPEG. The upshot is, that I will *need* to convert the video files every time. From Apple MOV/MJPEG -> AVI/XVID.So, there is a large difference in duration for each movie (I have 8GB card which will hold 78 minutes total with this camera). It may sound like I'm going to diss on the camera, just setting the scene....I ended up compromising on the resolution of the movie mode. I wanted 1280x720. This camera does 848x480. The 720p cameras cost almost 2x as much.So I eagerly took some movies, downloaded programs to convert it and recompress it. The results were way beyond what I had expected. Once converted to AVI the file reduces in size by about 30% but maintains the same level of quality.Video compression artifacts are MUCH lower than my old camera. The resulting quality of the movies is FAR superior to the Exilim camera. Little to no edge fringing, little to no flickering on edges (the other camera had this sometimes). Similar contrast scenes are not smudged, detail was not lost due to compression.Although I disagree with the file format, I don't want to use MOV files, the choice of using MJPEG was a decent one. Yes, the files are much larger, but the quality is worth it.I have always been aiming for about 1.2GB/hour for my movies and now the target is 3GB/hour. The difference in quality is worth it. And besides, I have a huge hard drive that needs some filling!So, yes.

I wanted a smaller version to carry in my hiking bag and chose the DMC-FS3 8MP 33-100mm f2.8-f5.1 .  I'm delighted with it.. It has the same, intuitive, easy to navigate menus that are even improved over my older model along with an excellent quality Lumix lens. I was surprised how many features this very small camera has, and it only has a few things missing that my other one has along with a shorter zoom and smaller f5.1 at 100mm compared to the FZ7's f3.3 at 432mm, but for me, this isn't a big deal for the portability.. I can carry it in my pocket, it's that small. The only disadvantage I have encountered is that the flash is not that strong.. you have to be within 10-12 feet, but that's true of most of these smaller cameras in this price range, and even the more expensive small ones. The image stabilization is pretty amazing, allowing shots, even in dim light and full zoom. It also has a lot of \"scene\" settings for the novice. The burst mode is fast and great for portrait shots and almost guarantees that you will get a good shot of friends.

However there are definitely some things to consider before buying one for yourself. Here is my list of pros and cons...PROS:-Starts up really quickly.-Short recovery time after photo is taken.-Great macro shots.-The 'underwater' setting is great for taking the blue hue out of pictures taken at dusk.CONS:-(Super annoying!) Lens will fail to extend if you even slightly touch it when turning it on. The lens extends about 1-2 cm, then goes back in. Quite a pain to get it to extend and work normally again once this happens. I grab the lens and pull it all the way out; doing that while pressing the shutter button has worked for me every time so far. I sure hope it doesn't make the lens crap out in a year!-(Also annoying) Takes great shots except in high-contrast situations, then it's a disaster. Photos of sunny mountains with shady foregrounds are absolutely horrible. Either the sunny part is totally washed out and the shady part is normal, or the sunny subject is normal and the shady foreground is blacked out. The 'beach' setting does nothing to fix this. Messing with the white balance or exposure may do something, but don't hold your breath.-Uses batteries a little fast for my taste. I only got about 5 hours out of a full battery charge. Definitely buy 1 or 2 extra batteries, especially if you'll be using it for multi-day trips (then buy 3+).", "Date": "August 11, 2010"}, {"Title": "outstanding buy", "Author": "stranger", "ReviewID": "RSVLT6SYYKKCM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this camera for my 13 yr old daughter recently. Wish I had bought one for my wife a few months ago, but we stayed with Canon and she got an 870 IS - a nice camera but over-priced. The Lumix FS3A on the other hand, is a great value. It appears to be well made and the buttons have a quality feel. The lens is 33 mm on the wide end which is enough for most wide angle needs. The camera starts quickly and there is not obtrusive shutter lag. We are particularly impressed with the macro performance. It seems like the OIS works better than on the Canon 870, and the exposure of the pics is more consistent although both tend to be over-exposed in the auto settings. No compact digital cameras like these take photos anywhere near the quality of the DSLR type cameras with quality lenses. The differences you read about in lens quality, etc. for these compacts just isn't that important compared with more practical considerations, such as overall performance, feel, and value. The FS3A is a fun and small camera that you don't need an insurance policy for. This camera is 5 stars mostly due to its value.", "Date": "November 24, 2008"}, {"Title": "good point and shoot for shows", "Author": "tanukisuit", "ReviewID": "R311ZAXZMQAA4J", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I took this camera with me to Bumbershoot to take pictures of The Weakerthans (indoors) and Del Tha Funky Homosapien (outdoors) and it held up pretty well. I got pretty close to The Weakerthans and I was able to snap some good pictures using the \"night\" setting with the flash turned off. The typical concert lighting for an indoor show didn't ruin the pictures so the pictures came out pretty well. When I took the camera to Del, I was right up front and it was able to capture him in action. Some of the pictures were blurry because he was moving around so fast, but, I don't think a camera could do any better unless it was an expensive camera with a super fast shutter speed... and those types of cameras are usually banned from concert venues unless you have a special press pass. Another feature that could be considered a downside would be the big screen in the back. While it gives you a really nice idea of what you're about to take a picture of, I'm always afraid of scratching it when I put the camera in my pocket. It hasn't happened yet, but, I'm being careful.In summary:+ Good to take into shows because it's small enough to put in your pocket and is powerful enough to take nice pictures.+ The battery life is very good compared to my digital camera that uses AA batteries. At the end of the day, I just plug the battery pack into the wall until the green light turns off.+ It comes with a built in memory that has enough room for about 16 pictures.- If you're looking for a camera with a really fast shutter speed, this isn't the camera for you. This is what I am talking about in terms of shutter speed for the novice picture taker: [...]If you're interested in taking pictures of moving objects without them being blurry, consider researching DSLR cameras. I just got this one because it is affordable.To parents/grandparents/guardians/siblings out there: This would be a good holiday present for a teenagers who go to see live music. It fits well in a small purse or pocket so it's easy to hide if they're not allowed in a venue. It's light and compact, making it easy to tolerate carrying around during a 4 hour show, and if they turn off the flash option, then it's also not detectable.

Nothing fancy but I want pictures to give as gifts so I need good quality.  I dropped my original in the water during a grad class and needed a quick replacement for photographing plants and flowers.  Quick?  I got it THE NEXT DAY. Brooklyn to CT.  So I bought this even though it was green.  Which, after going to a wedding where I could pick my camera out from all of the silver cameras on the table I truly appreciate.Short review: buy it!  Cheap, small, good sharp images.  Movement is trickier but you just have to change settings.  Long battery life, true to the manufacturers statement - 300+ pics per charge.  Read the manual (yes, nerds do not like to do this) but it was painless and I learned about some cool features.Longer: Like every other electronics nerd I researched cameras before I bought this and it kept popping up everywhere as top rated.  Like a B or B+. The biggest thing I learned about higher megapixels (10MP+) is that for cameras built with older technology the processors can't handle the memory and the images are fuzzy.  Even if the megapixels are 13 for example you may get unfocused pictures.  So that is why I got this - under 10MP you are \"safe\".  My pictures are sharp at 5 X 7 which is all I need.  The Leica lens has a great reputation for clarity and I think that is why this is a front runner.  I am not going to repeat what others have said but here are some things that I love:- Small, fits in a pocket and the small zipper camera bags you can but at Target.  It is even smaller than my PDA but has a big display.- Even the battery charger is small so you can bring it with you.- You can lock pictures, so my niece and nephew can't delete them.- Can display pictures in a grid so it is easier to delete using it.- Controls are intuitive even without reading the manual.- Stabilizer does a good job.- Without the flash still can take room light pictures (still only).Some dislikes: The red eye doesn't eradicate all of the redness sometimes, and the flash recovery isn't as fast as my other camera.So for an everyday camera it is perfect!", "Date": "August 17, 2009"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera for a low price", "Author": "Jerrica B.", "ReviewID": "RNSKO396CSQTO", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera to replace a large bulky Fuji FinePix.

I wanted to replace it with a equally compact model having a wider angle lens and a larger zoom range, but frankly none of them out there are a big enough step up to justify upgrading. In fact, it would mean a downgrade in image quality in many cases. It seems that most of today's compacts have sacrificed image quality to the great god \"megapixel\". Their images show excessive (IMO) noise even at 200 iso and things just get worse from there. The FS3 in comparison maintains good image quality up to 400 iso and even 800 iso is decent for small prints or for viewing on an HDTV (which is how a lot of pictures I take on trips get viewed - physical photo albums are as dead as film).The only negative aspects I can identify are, first, that the corners are a little soft, particularly in the middle of the zoom range, and second, that sometimes the focus takes a little too long to lock on, which has caused me to occasionally miss shots.The darned thing is just too good!

It is an older camera, and I've played with some of the newer versions of the Panasonic Lumix and they have yet to disappoint me. The only downside that I notice is that the file size for the photos, no matter how much you adjust settings, is always the same and always fairly big (about 2MB a photo). Not a problem if you have 4 or 8 gb memory card, but definitely annoying when you compile all your pictures over time in a single location.Anyway, nice camera, works well, not the best, but definitely in the top category of standard digital cameras..", "Date": "May 13, 2010"}, {"Title": "east to use", "Author": "Student of the Word", "ReviewID": "R3CQOFBNYHPFC5", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I am very pleased with this camera.

And the FS3 seems to fit the bill.  Reasonably fast start up (not instant, but good), accurate focus even in low light, video capability and a good lens.  This covers my demands quite well.  Even in basic auto mode, I got some very satisfying results during an evening of cosmic bowling.My only complaint is that the \"review/playback\" is a switch so it is possible to start the camera up and be right in playback, unable to take a picture since you have to switch it over to the camera function.  This is a slight annoyance compared to the \"ready to shoot\" functionality of other cameras.  Nothing too serious, just the one nit I have to pick with the camera.Since this is now one of the slightly older models of Lumix cameras, it can be had a phenomenal price.

I can save my dog's name and birthday in the camera! The things I don't like are that I wish it had a general \"indoor\" setting for taking indoor shots with flourescent overhead lighting.  I haven't found the right setting for that yet and so can't seem to get a really great shot in those circumstances.  I'm sure there's one available, but I'm going to have to research to find it and it seems that it should be a common setting.  Great for party shots at the club!  The party setting is fabulous with the dance lights.  Never got good shots like that with my old Samsung but it's simple snapshots were great and this camera is a bit more advanced.

Some of the pictures I took at an amusement park were unbelievable for a couple of reasons.

I am not a big manual reader (I have four young kids, I'll get to manuals later) but the menus were fairly self-explanatory.The only thing is that occasionally it gets lost on its way toward focusing.

Photos came out completely black with no images.

I didn't complain...I had paid $129. Prices drop. O well. But when her associate wanted to get one too, we discovered prices for the different colors very high...the FS3 ranged from $139 to $185 to $249. Why the price differences, when the only difference is the color. What happened to the $100 price? As new models are released, don't the older models drop in price?Oh, when my friend and I went through the manual together at McDonald's... with this green camera and the blue one out on the table... we drew admirers.
