The first line in the instructions say to hook it up to your video monitor with the RCA to BNC connector. This WILL NOT work.  I had to hook it up to a VGA monitor and then change the units output from PAL to NTSC to make the video work.  For a user without this option, they would be dead in the water.Other than that, I have it mostly set up without even opening the manual.  I do 100% overlap recording, so that is fairly easy to figure out.I replaced a bad 4 channel CIB unit that failed after 18 months.  The hard drive controller is bad, and I couldn't get tech support to give me a price on the part after several phone calls.", "Date": "September 13, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good but not reliable recording system", "Author": "marhoonay", "ReviewID": "RHT6J7FCNW1I8", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not recommended for those whom looking for reliable recording DVR, the DVR stops recording for several seconds per channel when it setup on alarm recording.

No continuous replay, have to click hour by hours2. Noisy exhaust fan, and now it does not even run after 2 and a half month of use.Rule of thumb for a DVR- allow continuous replayI can't ask for more, since this only cost 139$ without a hard drive..I did expect cheap quality, but not this poor!", "Date": "April 23, 2012"}, {"Title": "only had it for a few months and its record and playback, needs work", "Author": "ya think \"huh?\"", "ReviewID": "R1LOLGFJRENUBM", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I just purchased it a few months ago. It is set up almost identical to the Swann system and even does some of the same crap. My Swann did not record consistently and Cib is no better. When I do a search it seems to be loosing video over and over. What good does it do to record if it cant keep the recording in order, have a time stamp on it so you can see exactly where you are as you search, and now its not picking up any of my 5 cameras. I also could not get it to switch from one camera to the other based on motion. I was expecting it to be able to do that. It just records all screens the whole time and a little m pops up on the screen. I can be watching someone walk past the camera and the screen goes blank. When I do a search and fast forward or rewind, it freezes or goes blank. The glitches are not something worth dealing with for me. It's notreliable. Without a time stamp it won't hold up in court and when searching, you can't tell where you are at so you can't mark the time of the occurrence. My only hope is to find a software update on it, I guess. I recommend not buying this unless you have a way of not using the software.UPDATE: somehow it is back to showing the cameras again, not sure why, so i upped the stars to 3. I still have the other issues to deal with.UPDATE NUMBER 2: Now I'm getting a time stamp when I do a search after it did it's last reboot. Thank you techs for fixing that issue. It was a big one for me. I have not tried to reset the motion so I don't know if it has been fixed but if it has, I will definitely give it a higher rating. There was an option it does not have in playback that would be really nice. Continuous rewind or playback, and a faster playback time than 8x. It does blackout when I play it back in faster rewings so that would need to be fixed also.

No coaxitron control.  Software has many glitches.  While reviewing video, hitting play from fast forward will exit the playback function so you have to search and start all over again.  gets pretty annoying when you have to review 20 times before you can get to the point of the video you want to see.  if its even there.  dvr randomly stops recording channels for seconds or minutes at a time periodically.  Not good when you are looking for something and the screen blacks out during the time frame you need to see.  Works great as a live view/ multiplexer.
