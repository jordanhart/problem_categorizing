This receiver actually costs less than the original and works just as good. I have two different systems as my X-10 is daylight only. I have it hooked up to the PIP side of my 50\" HDTV and its picture clarity is just fine, not great though. I was pleased I could get just the receiver instead of trashing a whole system.", "Date": "January 20, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0033HOOPY"}}
