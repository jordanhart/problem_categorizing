I did some research looking for the right unit until I found this Pyle 17\" monitor. First I have to say this unit is a brain storm idea!1) If when I cut the sheetrock even I do not cut exact on the line the Plexiglas the unit comes with will cover the hole.2) The picture quality is great on this items when the customer answers the door he can see who is in front of his house.3) It matches great to the customer's kitchen wall and looks cool!I actually also got a 19\", as this was too small for the customers requirements.", "Date": "March 1, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$553.99", "Features": "17'' TFT LCD Screen Wall Mount - Wireless Remote Control - BNC Connector - Clean and Professional Installation\nPAL/NTSC Auto Color System - Brightness: 350 cd/m2 - For Use in Limousine/RV/Bus\n16:9 Screen Aspect Ratio - Viewing Angle: 40 degrees Up/70 degrees Down/Left & Right 70 degrees - Wall Mounting Bracket Include\n1280x800 High Resolution - Video Input: RCA & VGA - Dimensions: 16.07''W x 10.73''H x 1.10''D\n300:1 Contrast Ratio - Power Supply: DC 12V - Paintable Mounting Trim Included\nBNC Connector\n300:1 Contrast Ratio\nBrightness: 350cd/m\u00b2\nPower Supply: DC 12V\n16:9 Screen Aspect Ratio\n1280 x 800 High Resolution\nPAL/NTSC Auto Color System\nVideo Input: RCA, VGA & VESA\nTFT LCD Wall-Mountable Screen\nViewing Angle: 40\u00b0 Up - 70\u00b0 Down - 70\u00b0 Left & Right\nWireless Remote Control and In-Wall Mounting Bracket Included\nDimensions: (Screen): 16.07\"\" W x 10.73\"\" H x 1.10\"\" D\nWeight: 1.03 kg\nSold as : Unit", "Name": "Pyle PLVW17IW 17-Inch In-Wall Mount TFT LCD Flat Panel Monitor For Home & Mobile Use", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41dKp2m9nTL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B0037Z8GO2"}}
