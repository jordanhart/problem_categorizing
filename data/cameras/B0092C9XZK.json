{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Battery situation absolutely NOT for me", "Author": "Cheri", "ReviewID": "R2T98QF857UJOS", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I needed a camera. I am obsessed with taking photos and if anyone reads my reviews on cameras it is obvious that I take a lot of photos. I have used cameras that use double AA batteries for yrs and never had a problem I simply carry extras. Once I switched to cameras using the rechargable Li-on batteries I simply bought two and keep them charged and when one goes dead I switch it out.I am not into gadgets or smaller and better and hey look here's another button we can push!So when I couldn't find what kind of battery this camera used in the description I wrote the seller asking. Not getting a response and having shopped for hours on pc trying to find what I wanted at the best price I went ahead and ordered it thinking no company would make a camera that you couldn't find a replacement battery.Turns out battery can not be replaced! It stays inside the camera and you have to plug in the camera to charge. So if you are out shooting photographs and it goes dead too bad.THAT is a HUGE deal breaker for me. I perhaps should have know better however I am STUNNED anyone would even come up with such an idea....what is this a $40 throw away??Anyway my Son doesn't take photos very often and he said he would love to have it and he didn't see the problem with the camera being worthless once the battery went dead. He just plugs it in. As I said not for me. Son said he likes the camera so if you don't mind being without a camera in the middle of taking photos at family gatherings or on long days at the lake, the zoo, vacations or whatever you might like it as well.I know I am \"old school\" but how could anyone even design such a thing? Since buying this I have been told this issue doesn't bother some folks so maybe it won't be a problem for you. YOU can take from my review what you will and make your own decision. For my money BAD idea. There are a lot of options in cameras, same money only you can actually have TWO batteries LOLNO problem AT ALL with seller price and delivery! Just wish I could have gotten a response before I ordered...( never did get one at all)May God bless! There is a beautiful fog here this morning so I am going to get my old Samsung out and take a SPARE battery that I keep ready and take some photos! :0)Happy shooting!Cheri", "Date": "October 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "Pretty good camera for the price", "Author": "juless", "ReviewID": "R2ILL08PCBR9RM", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Pros: I really like the fact that it's small, sleek, & thin.

Its small, light and takes decent pictures.  I paid around half of the suggested retail price, which is about what I wanted to spend.  And I ended up spending less than I would have to get a camera designed specifically for children.  Its rechargeable, but he's taken over 100 pictures and the power is only down one bar.I wouldn't make this your go to camera necessarily.  But if you need a small, light, inexpensive camera, this one is pretty good.
