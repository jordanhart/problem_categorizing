It performs very satisfactorily.  The company advertises comprehensive customer support but chose against responding to a routine inquiry and another inquiry related to registering the product with them. Consequently, I have no customer support from this company.  I am left with replacing components as they wear out and doing so through consumer channels. This is not too great a burden if the system proves durable but it's a shame that the company stands serenly by and will not fulfill their promises.I had a problem with the system and renewed my efforts to gain customer assistance. This time, a representative named Jared took care of the registration problem as well as the functional problem. I have upgraded my review to reflect this.July 2013: I turned the unit on after a hiatus of a few months.  I noticed that the infrared cameras had grown dim and two had the night vision component completely inert.  I again activated the system a few days later and, after a few minutes the video failed. This is the second time the video component has crashed or burned up. I am uninterested in using this system further.", "Date": "August 9, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$1,772.99", "Features": "Video inputs: 16 Channels with RJ12 and 8 BNC\nAdvanced Scheduling; Pre-Event and Post-Event recording (up to 2min ea.).\n3 recording modes\n1TB hard drive included (expandable up to 2TB)\nConnection: 10/100 ethernet", "Name": "16CH SYST W/ 33FT NV 8CAMERAS", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51vHEkp7tpL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004I7I4WM"}}
