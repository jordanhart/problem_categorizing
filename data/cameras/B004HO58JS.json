{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Eros Shadow", "ReviewID": "RVB119VKV6MET", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I personally bought this camera because I am going to add some small films to my portfolio! This camera has some good points and bad points.The defining feature of this camera for some is that it auto-focuses, has an auto iris, and auto white balances. For some people this is great and for others it is not. When going for wide shots it is great but as you get closer to something, in proximity, not with zooming, it becomes much more yellow and picks up the first light source it finds. You can try pointing at a white wall and then going for a close-up but it ends up becoming discolored none the less. I've noticed on previous versions of this camera people complain about half of the shots being out of focus. With this camera you just need to go slow and take your time when taking shots. I even bought a small bendable tripod for my camera to assist with it being steady.For the price it is excellent! The pictures are beautifully clear (approx 14 megapixel) and outside shots look very nice. The camera has several different settings depending on the subject or the situation. I found the \"baby mode\" to be extremely humorous - it is simply that, for when you are taking pictures of babies. The menu is extremely easy to navigate so the basic user shouldn't have a problem finding what they need. Also the video is beautiful, keep in mind though if you want audio you may need to record with something externally.The software it comes with is good for first time users. There is an easy to import feature, just like most programs and devices, pops up as soon as you plug in the camera, and you can choose to import or not. You do not need this software necessarily to take pictures/videos from the device.The thing I find the most accessible is the memory cards for this camera. I was personally looking into a Sony before this purchase but they have their own memory card you need to buy that is extremely pricey. I own two class 10, 16gb transcend SD cards and they work great in this camera. Each card costs less than $20.00 if you get a good deal! You definitely want a camera that requires memory that is used on multiple devices.Overall I gave it four stars because personally I dislike auto-features but I knew this is what I was getting into when I bought the camera. This camera is mostly easy to use and is working great in the couple days I've had it! Definitely get this camera if you want something that's easy to work with and carry as it is small and light!", "Date": "December 8, 2011"}, {"Title": "Not what I was hoping for", "Author": "Chrisso", "ReviewID": "RZWC684QUL2ZB", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Got this camera as a replacement for my old Fuji Finepix F20 6.3 MP camera, which I have had for 5 yrs. & LOVE.  I am very disappointed in this new Fuji JV200 model.  I wanted something with a lot higher pixel rate, that had a nice zoom and was smaller and lighter than my old Fuji. I hate the double flash that you can't turn off.  I also dislike how you can not always set/control the flash in many shooting modes.  And there are too many shooting modes...some of which are useless, bordering on gimmicky.  Though the pixel rate is higher and you can blow up pictures quite large without pixelation, overall the lens and focus are not as sharp as my old camera.  It's macro ability is mediocre--my old camera is far superior.  Because of the higher pixel rate, this Fuji does take nice landscape pics, which are good for enlarging.  The pics I took at night of Christmas lights were all blurry--despite using the night time setting.  The pics I took using macro were often blurry, depsite using the macro setting.  That's my biggest complaint about this camera--the blur! Overall, the lens/focus ability of this camera is not as precise as my old Fuji. Indoor pictures look better using the landscape setting, rather than the indoor shooting mode. I was hoping that since this model is 5 yrs. newer than my last Fuji, it would pack more punch in a smaller package, with some better tech options.  I expected the same or better quality, in a smaller package, with a smaller price.  I have been let down on all accounts by this camera.  I still prefer my old Fuji camera which is better in almost every way.  I use this new one as a back-up, or for landscapes, when I need a lot of pixels.  It would be an OK beginner camera for a kid, but it really doesn't meet my needs, or standards for good pictures. This Fuji is a disappointment and  is frustrating & unpredictable in it's photo quality.", "Date": "December 25, 2011"}, {"Title": "just right", "Author": "Momto3", "ReviewID": "R33DYXZ62D1NJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is a perfect gift for a child.  It takes decent quality pictures and has held up to a lot of banging around for 2 years and still going strong.  The screen is great for them to watch the many videos they take and it holds the charge for a long time even when they watch them a lot.  It was a great buy.", "Date": "November 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Brian C.

The images are often blurry.  I can take pictures in the same situation back to back and they will look completely different.  I would definitely not recommend this camera to anyone.  The battery life is okay.  The video is also ok, the sound isn't great on the video though.  I would say pay an extra few dollars and get a good camera - I'm planning on buying a different camera since I hate this one so much.", "Date": "June 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "nice compact purse camera", "Author": "aditya talwar \"sugarlandman\"", "ReviewID": "RC0Q7PSOTRJD2", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "i bought this camera as xmas gift at the spur of the moment looking at the ad from Amazon. there was similiar series released from nikkon/sony etc in same price range a bit higher thou. fuji camera, so far is quick close up photo shot and easy to carry. In this size a whole range of cameras as been released recently, with increasing range of focus, memory parameters and colors. it works as expected. unless you try a camera in store you take chances. The only thing, i wished, probably i had bought a higher focused or memory camera. will see how it lasts.", "Date": "January 11, 2012"}, {"Title": "Good Camara", "Author": "Jose Briceno \"Dr. Briceno Polacre\"", "ReviewID": "R3BKMDK6ZAU0VT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I aquire this camara for a gift, nice price and was really a good purchase and gift was very welcome.

The Fuji camera is really cute, very small, very light weight. It auto sets the picture so they turn out really good despite my lack of skill. Glad it has a cord attached so I don't drop it down an embankment like the last (other mfg.)camera. Easy to use. It did not come with an SD card so we had to take one from an older camera and then go buy a new one. It does not work without the sd card. No internal storage? Other than that I really like the camera and the price was also good.", "Date": "January 3, 2012"}, {"Title": "i had to send it back", "Author": "Kate", "ReviewID": "R3NMTBBX09KH8H", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "Not sure what went wrong with this camera but i had to send it back because it wasn't working properly. amazon gave me a full refund for it.It wasn't taking pictures correctly I think.I bought it as a gift for my mom... it was a lightning deal.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$159.99", "Features": "14 million effective pixels; 1/2.3 inch CCD with primary color filter; 3x optical zoom lens plus approx 6.7x digital zoom\n2.7 inch TFT color LCD monitor; HD movie 720p with sound\n6 scene SR AUTO; Motion Panorama mode with auto stitch\nDigital image stabilization; Face, Blink detection; Smile and Shoot mode; Auto red-eye removal; Tracking auto focus\nUSB 2.0 High-speed; Video output NTSC / PAL selectable; SD/SDHC memory card slot (card NOT included)\n14-megapixel CCD sensor; 3x wide-angle optical zoom lens\n720p HD movie capture\nAdvanced image search function for easy browsing\nSmile/Blink Detection; i-Flash Intelligent Flash\nPowered by Li-ion battery; capture images and video to SD/SDHC memory cards (not included)", "Name": "Fujifilm FinePix JV200 14 MP Digital Camera with Fujinon 3x Optical Zoom Lens (Black)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41DLGvgc5wL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004HO58JS"}}
