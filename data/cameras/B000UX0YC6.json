You need to become familiar with the different settings to get good pictures. I lost most of the first batch I took. The next day I started looking at the settings and everything was fine. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to take decent pictures but maybe is not a serious photographer.", "Date": "March 8, 2008"}, {"Title": "Pleased with this camera and its software", "Author": "I. Clark", "ReviewID": "R23IJL1A8PLPRA", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have never used another compact digital camera, but I would consider this one very user-friendly.  It was bought as a gift for a 9-year-old who quickly taught himself how to use all its functions (and has been taking pictures constantly).  The panoramic photo tool is easy to use and very effective.  Battery life has not been a problem, but an accessory must be bought if you don't want to be limited to recharging only through a powered USB port.  Without a memory card the camera only holds about 10 photos at 7 megapixel resolution, 15 at 5 megapixel, or 4 seconds of video.  A card really is an essential purchase.  I have been very pleased with the EasyShare software.  I expected to use iPhoto on my Mac for downloads, but the Kodak software is intuitive and attractive and well organized.  Consumer Reports had this camera listed as a Best Buy and I do feel it was a good purchase.  Picture quality is quite good, the camera has a lot of useful features, and it's priced well below some comparable models by other manufacturers.", "Date": "March 4, 2008"}, {"Title": "Only one complaint so far...", "Author": "Don Macmurray \"Semper Fi\"", "ReviewID": "R3DFYP014Y9XR6", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera is good for the money.  One issue I have is the speed at which it stores the image once the shutter button has been pushed.  I have an older Olympus camera that is quicker.  At first I thought it was the SIM card that I bought but it even stores slowly to the internal memory.  The work-around is that you can push the shutter button a second time to be ready for another picture while the original image is being stored.  All-in-all this camera works for my purposes.

It is reasonably small and has a lot of features.  I was unfamiliar with some of the features that came with it which the manual did not describe.  It wasn't until I went to Kodak's web site and found manuals that described the features.  I am still getting used to the camera and learning about it but so far I really like it.", "Date": "October 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "M753 Kodak Camera", "Author": "Proud Dad", "ReviewID": "R1U60R9E7ZG63Q", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the fourth Kodak digital camera product our family has purchased.
