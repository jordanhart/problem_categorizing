I have picked up a few cameras and mostly all of them were wireless baby cameras or unsecured security cameras, but it will not pick up the typical Wireless IP cameras like an axis that encrypts the frequency or channel. While its pretty cool when you pick up your first camera, you will be disappointed for the most part as most wireless cameras you were hoping to pick up are encrypted. The camera hunter does do what it says, but it just doesn't go into detail which type of cameras it will pick up and won't pick up which is huge when deciding if you're going to spend $500.", "Date": "March 31, 2013"}, {"Title": "not sure if item works", "Author": "irving bond", "ReviewID": "R139JJ472K9AH2", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I live in a major city in the United States.
