This camera could not keep up with the functions selected causing it to freeze up and stop working all together. If you take the batteries out and put back in could get it to turn on again. Returned it and bought GE w1000/1200 from Walgreens and it was 5 dollars cheaper, not as pretty - but - OH what a difference! With all the same functions, would recommend the GE for the best buy for an over 10 meg dig camera. Soo glad I opened Polaroid camera this early to test out. I would actually give it a 0 but don't think you can.", "Date": "November 29, 2009"}, {"Title": "Crack prices!", "Author": "Will and/or Caroline C.", "ReviewID": "R8JV2SWWM9NJK", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My wife has this camera and it is amazing! I don't know what happened to the guy who gave it a 1 star review maybe he just got a defective camera or something because we've yet to have anything like that happen.The $130 price tag here on amazon is ludicrous though, my wife got hers at a physical store for $55 on sale, and it was only originally marked for $69.99.I downloaded the \"invisible hand\" add-on for my Firefox browser (really helpful by the way) at right now it's about to have a stroke trying to get me to go to another site for this item for almost $54 cheaper.", "Date": "November 26, 2010"}, {"Title": "Camera", "Author": "D.

For my needs, it's useful to keep a cheap camera with me for work and other things.Alright, I have a couple other cameras of better quality, like a Sony DSC-W150 and a Pentax SLR.  This isn't the greatest, but I didn't want something that if it broke, stopped working, or got stolen, I would cry over it.  It's small, it's cheap (on top of the 49.99, I had a 20 percent off coupon, so it was even less expensive!) and it does the job, so far.  Picture quality is decent.  Ok, one complaint I have is that it doesn't always start up when I press the power button.  I don't know if it's the narrow design of the switch vs. my stubby fingers (pressing it a second time gets it).  The second is the small black plastic cover on the USB connector doesn't seem to stay on and is loose.  Aesthetics.  Anyway, I put a 8gb Sd card in, and I'm ready to go.  I did not choose the camera for the no. of megapixels.  The only time you need to care about megapixels is if you were going to blow the picture up beyond poster size.  If I just need a camera to take a picture of a label on a machine, or the cute puppy and email it to someone, this will do.I'm only giving it 4 stars because I don't know how long it's going to last.  Overall, it seems pretty sturdy, but I said the same thing last year about a refurbished Sony DSC-S930 that died on me after 6 months.  I'll follow up later..", "Date": "January 26, 2011"}, {"Title": "Review", "Author": "Mary La Tour", "ReviewID": "R36RF4K39YYYFG", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The item that I ordered was to replace one that met a very unfortunate end.

My last camera was an Polaroid i737 7MP one so I brought this one base on that.

Very slow and you end up missing good shots if you try to shoot continuously. Several months and after hardly using it, it started acting up. Playback light flashes, and when pressed, a \"bad file\" message pops up. It takes picture when it feels like it. I got so fed up with it; I ended up smacking it.Save your money and busy a better camera such as Kodak or Sony.", "Date": "March 10, 2012"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B002RYVT48"}}
