Overall, I would say it is somewhere between good and great.One thing I recently noticed while taking pictures in the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs is that this camera doesn't take such great pictures in lower light. Maybe I was using the wrong settings, I had it set to Automatic, and I have used cameras all my life. If I was more familiar with this camera, I would have tried more of the manual functions. I do like how you can adjust the f-stop and shutter speed to whatever you want, this may have solved my problem. The low light images came out a little bit blurrier and grainier than brighter light pictures.In bright light, I can't say how great this camera is. In bright sunlight, which is often ideal for taking pictures, the image clarity is AMAZING. I took pictures of a valley here in Colorado, and literally, I zoomed in on a house about a mile away (after I took the picture I zoomed in while viewing it on the LCD), and although the house wasn't extremely clear, you can tell if there is someone on the deck!I wish I could give this camera 5 stars, but to be honest if you bought a $700 7 megapixel camera, you are probably going to get a 5 star device. I believe the price paid for this camera was about $200 though, so if you are an average consumer, not a professional photographer, you will probably love this camera. You definetly can't find a better camera in this price range, and I'm hoping this camera serves me well as I would have no problem keeping this as my main camera for the next 3 years (until I beat it up)One last thing, a friend of mine recently got a camera (6 or 7 MP) and I don't remember what brand, but it could take pictures literally like 2 per second. This camera does take about 3-5 seconds for the flash to charge back up, so it's hard to take action shots since you can't take a quick succession of pictures. That would be nice, but honestly not many cameras can do that anyway.", "Date": "March 23, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Great Camera at a Great Price !!", "Author": "John C \"John\"", "ReviewID": "R1GR3WB40J2EKN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "WOW!!  I'm impressed.  I just bought this camera for $177.74 at Sears.  (Price match of Target sale price $188.00 minus an additional 10%).  It takes great pictures 7MP, and near broadcast quality video (640x480 @ 30fps).  It has full auto mode for the beginner, and full manual mode for the pro's.  I love the manual mode, you can set the shutter speed from 1/2000 sec. up to a full 15 sec. exposure.  With that exposure you can do those really cool night shots of the highway with the car headlights / taillights streaking by, or even take indoor pictures without using the flash.  You can record audio sound bytes and attach them to a still image. I recorded the family singing \"Happy Birthday\" and attached it to a photo of the candles being blown out.  It has adjustable white balance, and for color correction, you can choose the type of lighting being used (ie, Flourecent, Tungsten, Sunlight, etc.).  The bottom line is:  This is a wonderfull camera even at the $299.00 MSRP.  But, if you watch the add's you should be able to find it for under $200.00.", "Date": "December 12, 2005"}, {"Title": "great camera", "Author": "Adrian Tejera \"Adrian\"", "ReviewID": "R1GZT1LRCWUW9F", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is the best camera I have purchased yet!

Mine came with a 128 mb card, and it holds about 60 photos when set to highest quality.  Also came with a carrying case, a USB cord, and a battery charger.

As I titled this, no other camera in this price range comes close to offering the same features. The picture quality is great (7 megapixels), the 2\" display certainly beats anything smaller and it's simple to use. The battery charger (with rechargeable batteries) and travel case are icing on the cake. I held off buying a digital camera for a few years because I knew eventually that a model of this quality in this price range would come along. I'm glad that I waited. Even at Amazon's price of $284 it's a good deal. Do your homework and shop around. I guarantee this one will stack up with the competition.

Very impressive that doesn't confuse people. It is one of the most easiest to use camera on the market. Relatively small size and a 32mb card (not the usual 16mb) as well as a rechargable battery kit which should be good for 30 pictures or about 3 minutes of movies.

Was \"upgrading\" from a Sony 2.1 meg camera.  Very easy to use with great features, but was not happy with the color of the photos - most seemed almost faded or washed out when compared with the old Sony (pics taken of same subject in same setting).  Even took the camera to a \"pro\" to check the settings to see if it was user error - he had the same results.  Ended up returning the camera and purchased a Kodak Z760 with dock for the same price.

I use mine with a 256MB memory card, which significantly limits the camera's use for taking video clips, but with a 1GB card this should not be much of an issue.  The combination of optical and digital zoom allows you to blow up selected portions of a longer range picture without compromising the quality of the image, although your ability to do this on a lower resolution is obviously not going to be as great.  I normally don't use the full 7MP capacity simply to allow a larger number of photos between downloads, but it's nice to know it's there when I need it.  Definitely not a bad camera for the price.  On the down side, I would note that this seems a bit fragile.

The pictures weren't bad and the camera is easy enough to use, but I've had nothing but problems trying to download the photos from the camera to my computer -- and I work with technology all the time, so it's not like I'm clueless!It doesn't work on a Mac at all, so if you only have a Mac you can't use this camera. It did work on my PC for a little while, but when I had to upgrade my PC, the CD they gave me will not reinstall the camera on my computer. Samsung does not offer any sort of downloadable drivers from their site, which is a real pain. Their customer service is horrible. I spent 45 mins on their live chat and the end result was \"plug it into another PC and see if it works.\" I have no other issues with other CDs, DVDs or removable UBS drives on this PC, so it is definitely the camera.Also, you have to use Samsung's rechargeable batteries. If you travel overseas, you know what a pain it is to have to use plug adapters to recharge batteries. My international adapters don't work half the time, so twice I've been overseas and not able to take pictures because the batteries wore out.In a nutshell, I now have a camera that won't download pictures to my PC, nowhere to go to get the drivers, and I get no where with their customer service.

However, for the low price, I thought the quality of the photos was decent.Then, about a year and a half after I bought it, the camera starting giving a \"low battery\" warning and shutting off after only about 5 photos, with brand new charged batteries.  I called Samsung and they tried to convince me that it was a high power device and that 5 photos was \"normal\" performance. I disagreed and persisted with my complaints and eventually they replaced the camera as it was still under warranty.The replacement camera worked fine for about two years, and then started having the exact same problem as the first one.  Brand new batteries resulted in a low battery warning after only a few photos.
