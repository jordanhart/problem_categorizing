{"Reviews": [{"Title": "OK but not very clear - not worth the money", "Author": "AEinstein", "ReviewID": "R1YZZQ0UPC94Y", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this QD6002D hoping I would get a clear camera with a reasonably close image.The camera has disappointed me in almost every way.To begin with in order to ZOOM or FOCUS the camera you have adjust a screw on the camera.  Or to set the camera up you have to push a BUTTON located on the input cable about ONE FOOT from the camera.Now imagine this.... you have the camera mounted in the location you prefer, then you have to somehow connect a display -within reach of the camera- so you can FOCUS or change the SETTINGS!!!!  Try that while on a ladder!After doing a balancing act and getting it set up I found the CLARITY of the image to be POOR.  I climbed the ladder more than once to try and correct the unclear image.  I even attached another camera to the same connection to verify that it was good.The original cameras that came with the system have a sharper image.Don't waste your time or money expecting a better camera.", "Date": "November 7, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$199.99", "Features": "600TVL of Resolution\nUltra high defintion video\nManually adjustable 2.8mm to 12mm varifocal lens and focus\nState-of-the-art IR cut filter\nOn Screen Display (Built In)", "Name": "Q-See QD6002D-N Elite Dome Color Camera with 600TVL and 70ft of Night Vision", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51-oB6ZntoL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B005LOV3SI"}}
