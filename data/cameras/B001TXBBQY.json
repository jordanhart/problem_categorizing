I must have read every review on the web about this cam and wanted to over look what most of the reviews said and hope they were wrong, but they weren't. First off let me say that the build quality of the camera is excellent and felt solid and comfortable in my large hands, but unfortunately that didn't help it take good pictures. I really wanted to like this camera but I just couldn't over look some of the problems.The image noise was bad like most of the reviews said.The pictures seemed too dark compared to other cameras I've had in the past.Quite a few of the shots were out of focus even though it said it was focused when I took the pic.The color red is way too strong and stands out like a sore thumb. Even though it's adjustable in the camera I just couldn't get it right.", "Date": "May 19, 2009"}, {"Title": "Not what I expected - sorry Samsung!", "Author": "E. Goldblatt \"Clearsky\"", "ReviewID": "RI0SKO1GMHXEA", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "Well, after using the camera for a few days, I'm going to return it! I was so excited about this camera - I thought it could be \"the one\"! But alas, unfortunately it wasn't. I had been watching this camera ever since it was announced, the day I finally saw it in stock on Amazon - I jumped. Actually, I was a bit upset when I paid over $33.00 for \"expedited\" shipping (just couldn't wait for regular shipping) and it was not shipped for a week from the vendor. Oh well! One more thing - since I am returning the camera, 6thave.com is charging me 15% restocking fee. I wish I had known this before I bought from them, unusually Amazon products do not have this - again - Oh well! This is the price you pay for trying to be on the \"cutting edge\"! What a geek I am. By the way - I also own a NV24 and kinda like it except that the sound cuts out when you zoom (that was the deal breaker for me on that).Extreme Summary: As with many of these types of point and shoot cameras - the HZ10W take pretty good pictures in bright light outdoor shots. But indoor - not so good! Video inside or out - not good at all (in my humble opinion). I will only review my negative points here - that's what most of us really want to know.Now for some detail:Still Pictures (these notes are after trying many different settings):1) Lot's of \"noise\" in the pictures indoor (any setting I tried). I simply could not get a good clear shot.2) Color was not consistent - sometimes way bright sometimes dull (?)3) Some focus issues - not consistent. I know I know - I held it real still - even resting it on the table, etc...4) And something very strange - sometimes while taking a shot indoors, when you press the shutter button to take a pictures, it goes though it's thing by focusing and charging the flash etc., but then when you press down all the way to \"take to the shot\" nothing happens unless you release the button and then press again - very weird. It did this in about half of the pictures I tried to take. This was very frustrating and I feel if I was at a party or wanted to take a lot of pictures I would miss some good shots.5) Placement of the flash is very bad - you can VERY easily cover it with your finger.6) Sometimes the flash seems to overpower or under power at random shots.7) Very bad barrel distortion - I realize this is a 24mm, but come one! All the pictures look like you are looking through a tube.Now for the Video:1) Indoor and outdoor are not as good at all. Simply, the video is not sharp, even in good outdoor light. Now before anyone say \"get yourself a dedicated camcorder\" don't even go there!!!! Nowadays when these manufactures say HD I expect HD!!!! In all fairness, I did not hook up the camera via HDMI - I just used the SDHC card and transferred the file and played. I'm sorry - just not good.2) A lot of \"focus hunt\", especially while zooming3) Placement of the mic's are in strange places, they are on each side of the camera right where your fingers are. Although, the sound quality was OK - I'm concerned that I could easily cover the mic's up in the future - just poor design in my opinion.4) Now for the really bad part, when the camera is zoomed all the way in (normal position - un-zoomed that is) the barrel distortion is VERY bad, it's like looking through a \"fish eye\" lens. Also, it looks like the image is falling off the sensor because you can see what looks like something obstructing the edge (or peripheral) image. I know my finger was not over the lens, so it must be that the 24mm wide angle is too large for the sensor.Sorry Samsung - I really like your other stuff -  I own two 40\" HDTV's and a few computer monitors from you - love them! Maybe my camera is defective - but I'm not starting the game of back and forth - if quality control let this out that defective, I don't want it!All of this is too bad, because the fit and finish of the camera is real nice - seems to be a quality built unit, just not nearly as good as what expected! I really wish these cameras could just work out of the box with no massive adjustments. Check out my other reviews - the Sony T500 still wins!And the search continues........", "Date": "March 3, 2009"}, {"Title": "Samsung HZ10W Camera Review", "Author": "David Zachar \"David Zachar\"", "ReviewID": "R3U550XHW9B742", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the camera about 10 days ago and I must say I am Very happy with my purchase.After doing online research it came down to the Samsung HZ10W or the Panasonic TZ50. I liked the Samsung more because it had a few more features than the Panasonic. The features were: Samsung has a wider angle lens (24mm vs 28mm) and it also has a manual mode. So far I am very happy with the camera and it takes excellent quality pictures. In the wide angle mode it has a bit of a tube effect in which all wide angle's do. For me it does a pretty good job in low light as well. Would have been nice if they would have included a full manual vs having to go to the web and print one out. Over all, I am very happy with my purchase and would recommend this camera to anyone who wants alot of zoom/wide angle out of a small camera.", "Date": "May 6, 2009"}, {"Title": "Really Impressed", "Author": "David \"sugarwookie\"", "ReviewID": "R2Z5D8BYS2JDJA", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just got this camera yesterday, but used it for about 75 shots last night at an function. I have yet to really delve into all of the functions that it has (A vast array evidently, LOL!) however I do know the pictures that I took are really amazing to me. I used the auto mode and set the camera up on Fine mode, which is the next to highest setting. After reviewing the pictures the next day I was really impressed. The one thing that really sort of has me hooked on the camera is video mode. I shot a few videos and had the chance to review them on my laptop and with some decent light you'll be very happy with what you get! My problem was having to tote a camcorder around along with my camera and I'm more than happy with the video this camera produces! I also like the way the camera is made and feels. I was looking at one of the Canon power shots (Can't remember the model) and was going to buy it before I saw the Samsung. Most cameras in the range feel light, and sort of cheap to be honest. This camera is solidly built and I like how it fits my hands. About the only thing that I don't like about it so far is where the flash is situated. It's extremely easy to get your finger in the way and messing the picture up. I'm hoping I'll get used to it soon! I wish I could tell you more about the modes and options on it. The only thing I've played with is the beauty mode and it really does smooth the skin up on shots, very cool!
