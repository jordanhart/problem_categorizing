I found that with some thought to it's limitations (and there are plenty of them) one can get some really great shots, but the thing to keep in  mind is cameras of this caliber tend to not do as well in lower light situations, will have fixed aperture and focal lengths as there is no prefocusing w/ the shutter button where you half press it to get it to prefocus it's take or don't, nothing else, the scene modes are very limited as well but if you know enough about photography, you CAN overcome many of these limitations to a large degree and for the more photographically inclined, that may mean, getting in closer with the camera to get a close up instead of zooming in and perhaps even there may still have to crop in post processing to tighten it up even further if you can't get in close enough while maintaining focus would be one situation.I will agree that since it's a 5MP camera, the camera uses batteries like no tomorrow, especially with the flash so if you can, get high load batteries or use rechargeable batteries and keep the charger handy.So if you need to give one to a kid, that's what this camera is best for, but for most adults, something a bit more expensive/feature ladened such as the mid priced P&S; from just about any brand selling in the $150-250 range should do quite nicely as many of them now have optical zoom, many with image stabilization (neither which this little guy has), auto focus and generally better lenses than most of the super inexpensive models and you can get decent night shots (within reason for most P&S; won't fair as well like a good DSLR will at night)So in the end, be it this camera or others in the $50-100 range, don't expect miracles w/ any of them, some like this little guy will do better than others at basic picture taking and in image quality but their limitations are often going to leave people frustrated to want something better.Again, a good little guy for the price but there are plenty of other, models for not too much more that are much more versatile.", "Date": "January 9, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great little camera, with limits", "Author": "Angela Harms \"Writers' Resources, AngelaHarms...", "ReviewID": "R3R4UV3Z17UCWB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "This camera was my entry into the world of digital photography. I love it! And the 5 mp resolution is great for blowing up or for cropping what you need to.There are a few things I'll do differently next time, though.First, I got a camera without a microphone, because I assumed the video would be such a low-quality that we wouldn't use it. I was wrong, though. We have some terrific silent movies. :)Second, I didn't think I'd need optical zoom, but that's because I hadn't thought about taking landscape and outdoor pictures. Next time, I'll get optical zoom.Overall, this has been a wonderful entry-level camera. I'm so glad I bought it.", "Date": "September 9, 2006"}, {"Title": "A Child Can Take Great Photos", "Author": "Alan  Houston", "ReviewID": "R3FGR61J2A1NG1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A friend of mine buys \"throwaway\" cameras when she is going to take important photos, such as a vacation.  Why?  A $5 disposible camera requires only that you point the camera at the subject and push the shutter.  No decisions, no mistakes...very nice photos...at least on a sunny day.The Kodak EasyShare C315 is one of the rare digital cameras that is equally easy.  Just turn the power dial to \"auto\", point at the subject and press the very short and precise shutter release.  Zero delay...zero shutter lag.  The C315 has a fixed aperture and fixed focus.  The camera automatically selects the best shutter speed for the lighting conditions...ranging from heavy overcast or twilight to bright sun at the beach.  The result is photos that are in perfect focus, with bright, rich color.The C315 was designed for AA Lithium batteries.  Two batteries last for 800 photos with no flash, or 400 photos using flash for half of the photos.  So, a set of four Lithium batteries can last for up to 1,600 photos...or a two week vacation taking over a hundred photos per day.  And, of course, AA batteries are easy to find in virtually any city in the world.My question is this...why have camera makers stopped selling cameras like the C315...a camera that permits even a four year old child to take great photos?", "Date": "August 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "Couldn't wait to replace it!", "Author": "D. Gold-Rohde \"Dream Whisperer\"", "ReviewID": "RWEXKPBKWW6KP", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I bought this camera shortly after it first came out and since than, it always took terrible night pictures so, taking pictures of outside lit-up decorations around the holidays was very disappointing. However, this camera does take decent daytime pictures \"if that is all you want to take\". I also don't like the small screen since I love showing my pictures off or viewing them as soon as I take them so that being said, consider a bigger screen for immediate viewing or show and tell. Furthermore, I noticed in some reviews from other buyers who bought this exact camera only paying $50 and I personally feel that, that's all this camera was ever worth... I only wish that I paid that little.At any rate, if you want a wonderful camera... consider a Samsung SL35 10.2MP Digital Camera - You will love it!", "Date": "December 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "Pretty Decent Camera", "Author": "Bret Linford", "ReviewID": "R2G9TM29YI4EQH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Good Camera for family photos. The digital zoom is pretty bad though. If you are planning on using the zoom in your photos, get an optical zoom so that you can keep the resolution.

Wells \"AZPHATMAN\"", "ReviewID": "R1B091KU64ZHN6", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Keep in mind as you read my review. I am not saying this camera is the best camera on the market in 2012. I'm not even saying it was the best when introduced thirteen years ago. I'm saying that if anyone is planning on buying a single use camera for a short trip or vacation. At the going price of roughly $ 20.00 they should give this camera a serious look before they do.A friend of mine sent me some pictures in an email that were really good. The software of my computer identified the camera as a Kodak EasyShare C315 so I checked Amazon for some reviews. I was kind of surprised at the bad reviews so I contacted my friend. He said the camera is the best little camera he has ever owned and that he highly recommends it. With his recommendation I searched for and found one in like new condition on eBay for $ 22.49.After purchasing a 2GB SD card and found out that it's maximum SD card capacity is 1GB. So I ordered a 1GB card from Amazon and started taking pictures. Sandisk SDSDPH-1024-901 1 GB Ultra II SD Plus USB (Retail Package)A word to the uninitiated. This is actually a fixed focus camera just like the Single use cameras many people buy for taking on vacations. So basically it's always in focus. The zoom feature is not a function of the lens, its all digital. The lens is always in focus though like any other digital camera there can be some vignetting. In good lighting this camera produces pictures with surprisingly good detail. I personally use this camera for taking pictures of my vegetable garden and up close pictures of flowers with excellent results. True you cannot get right up on a flower but you can crop the photo. I personally use pictures of flowers taken with this camera for my desktop background. I will try to post some pictures for the top left corner of this page.There may be lots of things other old used cameras can do that this one can't. But for the price it's hard to beat. Not only that but it's also very small and lightweight and takes over 900 photos with a 1GB SD card. I use Sony Eneloop AA Ni-MH 2000 mAh rechargeable batteries with good results. I don't know how many pictures I get per charge but thats only because I started using the camera less than two weeks ago. At this point I have not had to recharge the batteries yet. For an old camera it's also surprisingly fast picture to picture even when using the flash. If I were taking a trip to Disneyland with some friends and wanted to take a few hundred photos I would not hesitate to take this camera.", "Date": "June 2, 2012"}, {"Title": "camera review", "Author": "Sebrina Richardson", "ReviewID": "R1F8OV2NJQUD46", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I enjoy taking pictures with this digital camera.

I bought mine about a year ago for $50 Dollars at Walgreens. There are obvious shortcomings of the camera, but there is only so much to be expected from a fifty dollar camera.
