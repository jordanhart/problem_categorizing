{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A very good choice for lots of people - easy to carry, easy to use", "Author": "Snap, Crackle and Pop", "ReviewID": "R1Y7E65ZBJDCVQ", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony W55 is the followup to the successful and popular W50. It's a very good compact camera, easy to carry and easy to use, and reasonably priced - so most people will be happy with it.Not much has changed from the W50, which in this case is a good thing!One change is that the W55 is a 7 MP camera, rather than the W50's 6MP. Honestly, that's not a big plus, as they haven't made the sensor that catches the light any larger.  Same (good) lenses, same size sensor = the same (good) pictures, but not better.  (Though it might help a little on features like Smart Zoom.)The obvious change is of course the colors.  Don't make too much fun of that!  There are 4 DSC-W series cameras in our family, colors would have kept my mother-in-law from taking my sister's camera home with her.  A little personalization is a good thing.The internal memory has been expanded (to 56MB), but I've never used the internal memory on the cameras that have had it, so I'm not sure that matters much.  It might be worth knowing how to use as a backup, for another dozen or two shots if your card is full, or you have some other problem.The controls, menus and interface on the W55 are reasonably easy to use.  For example, the W55 has easy access to the various scene modes (twilight, etc), with some explanation on the screen of what those mysterious little icons mean (so you might actually use them, since it tells you what they do!). If you're new to digital photography, there will be a learning curve.  But if you've used other cameras much, especially Sonys, you can pick this up and use many of the features right away.Read the short introductory guide that comes with the camera, though!The rechargeable battery should easily last you for a full day of shooting - hundreds of shots - with no problem. (Be a little wise about turning it off when you're not using it!) So you probably don't need a second battery, unless you're going into the woods for a while.  It's nice not to have to mess with bulky AA rechargeables. Also, lithium ion batteries don't have a memory effect, so don't worry about partial recharging. Just charge the battery each night. So - before getting a second battery, try it for a while and see if you need it.But get a case - something to protect the screen, at least.  A fully closed one might help resist rain and splashes a little, too.You'll also want to get a Memory Stick Pro Duo card - Pro cards are faster, and you need the smaller Duo size with this camera. Get a 1-2GB card so you don't have to think about running out of memory too much - if you shop carefully, you can find them for so little these days that it's well worth avoiding running out of memory.  You might want a spare card if you plan to travel for more than a week, or use the video mode often - which is surprisingly good (though a bit dark) if set to fine, but uses enormous amounts of storage at that setting.You can stretch your memory, and your hard drive space, by using one of the lower-resolution settings to take snapshots.  You don't really need 7MP for all your photos!The W55 will take better photos than those credit-card type cameras that have a tiny lens system - optics will always make a difference in a camera.  Any reasonable person will be very happy with the pictures from the W55, given the size of it.The camera will be a little slow and often take disappointing pictures in low light and dark situations.  Try the High ISO mode in low light no-flash situations - the picture quality suffers some, but most people will find it useful. Realistically, no ultra-compact camera will work really well in that situation - if you need that often, think about something with a bigger lens and bigger sensor. Good light always gives the best pictures with any camera. There are limits to what you can currently expect from any ultracompact camera.The W55 offers enough controls (through the scene modes and the Program mode) to allow a fair amount of control over the pictures, for an automatic camera.The charger is fairly compact and rated 100-240V, so while you'll need a plug adapter overseas you won't need a voltage converter. The battery charger is a little slow, though probably OK.Keep this camera charged and handy, and you'll find you take a lot of pictures because it's easy to carry and easy to use!", "Date": "March 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "Perfect for baby/toddler pictures", "Author": "J & A", "ReviewID": "R107Q6E34OCRPS", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is our third digital camera since we had a baby, but it is the first one that allows us to take nearly perfect pictures of our son (15 months old). The reason is simple: a very small shutter lag. All digital cameras (except the very expensive SRL ones) have a noticeable shutter lag (the time it takes from pressing the button to actually taking a picture). Our previous Minolta and Pentax were wonderful for still/nature pictures, but their 1+ sec shutter lag made it impossible to take pictures of a moving baby or to capture a nice smile. Now, this Sony has a shutter lag that is almost inexistent (without flash), and we can finally capture nice pictures of our son. We don't care about MP, but the 7.2MP is also a plus. The camera is also very fast to turn on, taking about 1+ sec, a very important feature for capturing those special moments. Overall, an excellent camera for our main purpose: to take family pictures.Pros: very short shutter lag, fast turn on/off, good picture quality, easy to use intuitive interface, easy to carry, very high resolution, good bang for the bucks.Cons: uses memory sticks (pricier than SD cards), proprietary (and more expensive to replace) cables, very noisy in very low light conditions.Bottom line: wonderful for family pictures.", "Date": "May 15, 2007"}, {"Title": "Stirred not Shaken", "Author": "Dennis Doverspike \"hrlitehouse\"", "ReviewID": "R2WZ6YD3LO1IL7", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am just an average guy when it comes to using a camera. Probably below average. I started trying to use 100% Sony electronic products because my computer was a Sony and Sony-Sony linkages make for easy use. Given that, here is what I think of the product:1. It is amazing how much camera you can get for the money. Compared to just 6 months ago, or a year ago, this is a lot of camera for the money. It is very small, fits easily in your pocket, but takes great pictures. Also, it is very easy to use and recharge.2. A visit to the Sony website, suggests that Sony has new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras that are very similar.  This makes it hard to compare cameras, even within the Sony brand, and makes you feel as if your camera is obsolete the minute you buy it.3. A problem with this camera, given it is so small -- do not shake. Your pictures will be blurry. I am a typical guy, with very little fine motor control. My hands have trouble holding small objects. Holding this camera in one hand and taking a picture -- well the results are not pleasant.4. I tend to be disappointed by the telephoto capabilities of these small cameras. I guess if you really want to zoom in, then you have to go to a big camera. But it still seems like the small cameras could offer more.5. Having said all of that, in the end, this camera is small and easy to carry, light weight, durable, and it is also easy to use. When you look at it, it looks well made. I ended up giving the camera to my in-laws, because they lost theirs. My in-laws tend to be technologically challenged. I said to them, just leave the dial set to the little green camera, and snap away. I have to say - they love this camera.Overall. For the money, a great purchase, technology is amazing. Just grab it with two hands or develop a steadier aim than I have.", "Date": "March 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony Hits The Sweet Spot", "Author": "R. Chumsae \"the_chums\"", "ReviewID": "R2ZV1WXBC4Q967", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "At under $250 for the camera, a 1 GB Meory Stick Duo, a good case, and an LCD protector, this is one fine camera.  The base price is less than $200, the 1 GB Memory Stick Duo (stores about 370 hi-def shots) is about $33.  There is a 56MB internal memory which would hold about 7 hi-def shots or 17 low-def, emailable images).  Duos come in up to 8GB sizes.The camera is not backward compatable with the Memory Stick or Memory Stick Pro.  To get to the small size of this camera, both the battery and the memory card needed to be much smaller than earlier models. So, each Memory Stick Duo (about half the size of the Memory Stick Pro) comes with an adaptor which allows the Duo to be plugged into the Pro slot on your PC or printer.The function selection wheel has always been a nice Sony design feature and it gets even better with the W55.  There are now 10 picture taking modes.  As you turn the selector, a short guide pops up on the LCD screen to let you know what this mode does....very, very nice feature since most shots are done in standard mode, and only once in while do you need the other modes, and now you can recall what they do!The larger LCD is very nice but does seem vulnerable to being damaged.  I recommend a good case and a quality screen protector.  I bought both from Asian suppliers for less than $30 delivered (my case, alone, retails at $35).The turn wheel ISO position allows low light/no flash by cranking the ASA to 1000 (very fast).  I tested this at a play where I was about 25' out from the stage.  Even in low light I was able to get good shots and good color.  In the worst conditions the photos did blur, but that's life.  I mention this because all my life I see people taking flash photos when the subject is many feet away - this simply does not work because small camera flash is timed with the shutter out to only 10 or 15 feet.  With the W55 in ISO mode you at least have a chance of a decent photo under these conditions.Camera recovery time and turn on time have been tremendously improved over past generation cameras.  This camera turns on in about 1 second and recovery after non-flash shots is instant, flash shots recover in about 1 second.  This is a big, big, win over many other cameras.  This camera also has two burst modes for taking multiple photos of moving action scenes.In the battle of cost versus quality and features, Sony really hits the sweet spot with the W55. In my view thare are some close competitors but all fall short in some way.For more serious work, Sony offers a Lens Adaptor ($25) plus 2.7X telephoto lens ($139) plus a wide angle lens ($49) plus an underwater case ($150).Another fun feature are the two macro modes; one for 7/16\" and up, and the other for 11\" and up.  I haven't used these yet so cannot comment on the quality, but I expect they work fine.Step up to the nearly identical Sony DSC W80 for about $50 more if you need image stabilization electronics.  If you tend to blur your photos, or do more low light shots, then the W80 is worth the extra money.", "Date": "July 2, 2007"}, {"Title": "Sony 7.2", "Author": "Edmund W.

So not only can you get good photos at the family reunion or graduation or vacation, you can get videos that can be uploaded to share! My only complaint is that the zoom is so minimal, at 3x, but I take this camera along with a powerful DSLR with a zoom lens, so I don't need zoom capability.

However, most people probably won't notice if you don't have a couple different cameras' outputs laying side by side.My biggest problem is that when the lighting condition is not optimal, you really need a steady hand to get a non-blurry picture. I have an old Fuji F10 which does not have IS either, it is easier to obtain non-blurry pics from the Fuji (granted, the Fuji F series are known for taken low light pictures).On the plus side, when you do get a good picture, this camera has less noise at ISO200-400 comparing to Lumix or Powershot.All in all, this is a decent camera for taking everyday shots. It is easy to operate, a delight to carry around, and given proper lighting, produces very nice pictures.

That was for the seven months that it worked. During a trip to Europe, I took some pictures, turned the camera off and then turned it on again a few minutes later to find the LCD not working. It was a bummer, but I thought not a big deal as I would have it taken care of under warranty when I got back to the states.I contacted Sony customer support, who directed me to mail the camera to a repair shop in Connecticut -- Precision Camera. They said I would have my camera back in seven to 10 days. Two weeks later, I received a letter from Precision Camera stating they concluded the LCD was broken due to impact damage, which wasn't covered under the warranty. I could pay $111 to have it fixed or I could have it shipped back unrepaired.I called Sony customer service again and explained to their first and second levels of customer relations personnel that the camera had not been dropped, hit or otherwise impacted. If it was impact damage that broke the LCD screen, it must have been the most subtle of impacts. They said they could do nothing for me and directed me to call the repair company.So I did, knowing what they would say. And they did. They told me their hands were tied and that the LCD was broken and the warranty voided. Even though I disputed the camera was damaged through any negligence on my part, they said they could do nothing.

I mean, cameras are scary! They have all these... words and abbreviations and little buttons, oh the buttons!But, I finally managed to calm myself, to breathe deeply, and to break out my handy Amazon searching skills. When I came across the Cybershot W55, I was mainly intrigued by the reviews. It had consistent, decent reviews, and the price wasn't so bad. (I myself bought a refurbished one from Amazon.)So, I bought it. Bit the bullet. Bought a case and a memory card. When I finally got the camera, I was amazed at how light and flimsy it felt. Surely, I got over this, and now think of our very old, outdated camera as clunky and overweight.This camera has a very nice design, is pleasing the eye, small enough to carry in a somewhat large pocket, but big enough to feel like you're actually holding a camera.And the best part? It's pretty easy to use. I was really intimidated by the buttons, and hey, I'm a child of technology. But I'd never played with a camera before. But after a day or two of taking an obscene amount of pictures of flowers and family members, I got used to it. Didn't even have to refer to the manual; I was pretty pleased with myself.I was further content with my purchase when I loaned it to my mother. Mind you, she's the type who when a pop up window appears on the computer, she squirms and calls for the nearest person to help her. So when she easily learned how to change the colour setting, turn the flash on and off, and use the zoom, I was content. She took some great pictures, and is now currently convincing her husband to buy her one!And just today, my little sister (she's 3) decided she needed to take pictures. While she was very responsible, and took some strangely decent ones, I do now have a very massive collection of pictures of the mall floor. But it was fun, and she greatly enjoyed it.All in all, this is a good choice.

These cameras usually last a good 3 to 5 years (or longer), and given that 5MP is more than enough from a quality perspective for 99% of the population, the higher MP values are a scam for people to buy a new camera.First, on the battery, it's good but measuring by number of shots is very deceiving because some people can take 150 shots in 10 minutes -- so keep that in mind.  Also, \"snapcrackle\" mentioned that Lithium Ion batteries don't have \"memory\" -- that's not true, here's more info on that (and can save you lots of $ by maintaining your batteries!):Although lithium-ion is memory-free in terms of performance deterioration, batteries with fuel gauges exhibit what engineers refer to as \"digital memory\". Here is the reason: Short discharges with subsequent recharges do not provide the periodic calibration needed to synchronize the fuel gauge with the battery's state-of-charge. A deliberate full discharge and recharge every 30 charges corrects this problem. Letting the battery run down to the cut-off point in the equipment will do this. If ignored, the fuel gauge will become increasingly less accurate. (Read more in 'Choosing the right battery for portable computing', Part Two.)Aging of lithium-ion is an issue that is often ignored. A lithium-ion battery in use typically lasts between 2-3 years. The capacity loss manifests itself in increased internal resistance caused by oxidation. Eventually, the cell resistance reaches a point where the pack can no longer deliver the stored energy although the battery may still have ample charge. For this reason, an aged battery can be kept longer in applications that draw low current as opposed to a function that demands heavy loads. Increasing internal resistance with cycle life and age is typical for cobalt-based lithium-ion, a system that is used for cell phones, cameras and laptops because of high energy density. The lower energy dense manganese-based lithium-ion, also known as spinel, maintains the internal resistance through its life but loses capacity due to chemical decompositions. Spinel is primarily used for power tools.So let those batteries run down all the way!  Remember that for notebook computers as well -- don't just plug it in and let it charge -- you'll kill the battery over time.  Cell phones as well -- sometimes the batteries cost more than you paid for the phones!Okay, sorry -- back to the camera -- please note that Memory Stick media, although showing up on TV's, etc. for reading -- are Sony-only -- so if you already have SD media then buying Sony gets more expensive immediately.  Some people aren't aware of that fact, and there are some great SD-based cameras on the market, so save your money there.Hope that helps!", "Date": "September 1, 2007"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT!", "Author": "Beth F.

I bought this camera the following weekend.One year later I am still very pleased with the camera. I have taken approx 3000 pics with it and it still works like new. It actually still looks pretty good as well. Probably due to the fact that most of the housing of the camera is made of metal not plastic.One very nice surprise with this camera is the video function. While its nowhere near HD quality it is still very good quality considering the size of the camera. Even when viewed on my 50\" plasma TV. In case you are wondering,unlike most cameras that limit the length of your videos to a pre-determined max time, you can record video for any length of time as long as you have available memory on the card. You may also mix video with photos on the same card as well.As far as picture quality goes, I feel it takes pictures Equal to or greater than cameras of a much higher pixel rating...in fact it almost takes as good of a photo as my $1200.00 canon DSLR set up.If you are looking for a small camera that takes great photos, has a great video feature, a good battery life, and is very durable.

Of  course if you shoot at a lower pixel setting you can  more than triple your storage space, but if you can get  a 2GB memory card--less than $25 at most stores, you can  easily shoot over 75 minutes of video or store close to  2000 stills!This is quite a handy little camera, easy enough for a beginner to use with its on screen directions and intuitive buttons and offering good performance in a small package to satisfy most casual users.", "Date": "December 16, 2009"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for a great price", "Author": "Discoveries", "ReviewID": "R3UAPH734IXC28", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I brought this camera 2.5 years ago.

It worked as expected.Things I loved:- Video mode for capturing sound and the \"feel\" of a place- ISO 1000 non-flash mode- EXIF data included in JPG files- Fantastic battery life - I took 300+ photos daily and the battery barely dropped below 90% capacity (recharge nightly for heavy use days)- Form factor- Automatic focus works almost every time- easy zoom switchChanges I'd make:- Stiffer \"mode wheel\" - it was changed easily when putting the camera in my pocket- higher ISO modes - 1000 wasn't high enough to capture the night Chinese New Years parade in Kowloon China. I have lots of blurry images.- include a mode that prevents digital zoom - limit it to optical zoom capabilities - Found this setting in the menu while in Costa Rica.- motorized lens cover and zoom; seems this will be the first thing to break- Menu isn't intuitive to me - seems the menu is one of the best in the digital camera world. I've gotten used to it.- Add a quicker resolution change mode for 7, 5, 3 MegaPixel resolutions. By default, I use 3, but for fine art, I'd like to change to 7 without diving into the full menu system.- Memory should be SD, not Sony memory stick- Plug for transfers should be USB, not proprietary- Battery charger should be over USB, not external or proprietaryMy next camera will:a) avoid the Sony memory stick-based cameras and go with a SD, Mini/MicroSD based solution for compatibility with my other portable devices (Nokia N800 Portable Internet Tablet) and built-in laptop ports.b) support higher ISO modes for better night time pictures without flashc) USB for charging and file transfersOk, I've traveled to Costa Rica and Argentina with this camera and have edited my prior review slightly.  I'm adding 1 more item for my next camera - manual exposure control. Why?  Well, while in Iguazu Argentina, I found myself on a full moonlight tour of the Iguazu Falls (Argentina side). The moon light was more than enough for my eyesight to work and have beautiful views of Garganta del Diablo (Devils Throat), but none of my photos turned out, none.  I also tried a few movies - nice sound, but no, nada, moving pictures.  Fortunately, I met a couple with an SLR and was able to acquire some moonlit photos they took.  Their photos required a 2 second exposure and a steady hand.BTW, this camera produces grainy photos at ISO 1000.", "Date": "February 18, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great Price, Size and Quality", "Author": "Ewafoevah", "ReviewID": "R5PJIDS459J5P", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Just recently purchased and used the camera at the Sugar Bowl.  Wanted a camera that would fit in my front pocket.  The incredible part of the camera is the flash, it brightens up a night shot very nicely.  The pictures from the game came out nicely even though we were not at field level.  I was able to capture the excitement of the crowd and the game with clarity.  Obviously the zoom is only 3X but the clarity makes up for it.Pros: Size, clarity and price.  There are many features I have yet to test. The sleek style and portablity.Cons: Lack of image stablizer, the image dial moves freely coming in and out of pocket.  Had to retake some photos as a result because the flash did not go off since some image settings do not have flash.Overall this camera is a great addition for everyday use.

It met all of my requirements.  Specifically, the camera rates high on ease of use, quality of photographs, and very high quality of videos.  It fits easily in a shirt or jacket pocket and is perfect for athletic activities.  I will take it along on my next mountain bike adventure.  The battery life is so good, that I didn't even make a dent in it shooting for 4 days.  I recommend a 2 gig memory card because you are going to want to shoot videos as well as photographs.There are some annoying vertical blue lines that appear on some videos and I am not sure if the camera has a defect or this is a problem with lens design in certain lighting conditions.  I will give Sony Customer Service a call on this.Serious photographers beware, this is a point and shoot camera only, the only manual setting is ISO. You have white balance, and focus and metering options also. Some of the programmed shooting settings might be useful, however, I shot in P (program mode) at all times.  The flash is deceptively powerful, so it can be a bit overpowering when shooting a close subject.Although small, the camera is easy to hold and operate and the buttons are laid out in an easy to use manner.  The viewfinder is invaluable in bright light when the LCD display is hard to see, a nice feature in a camera at this price.  The menu is easy to use also and seems to be very similar to the Nikon SLR menu.If you are looking for a point and shoot, compact, easy to use camera with very good quality images and attractively priced, consider this one.  Also a thumbs up to Amazon, both on price and speed of shipment (I selected free shipping and received the camera in 5 days during holiday season).Addendum: 6/9/08  The camera broke and had to be returned to Sony.  Large, vertical lines appeared in the photos.  I still like the camera, but don't think that it is very durable or will last very long before having to be replaced.

Ozdamar", "ReviewID": "R3IS8W5X8GV9QF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Sony Cybershot is an remarkable addition to anyone's collection of gadgets. Its small enough to bring with you anywhere you want and can have a long lasting impact on a otherwise normal adventure out. Unlike disposable cameras one has the chance to review their pictures with out having to go through the hassle of developing them just to figure out that it is not a good picture. The Sony Cybershot has so many features and extras that allow your pictures to come out amazingly clear. I have had the Sony Cybershot for three years and it goes everywhere with me. It conveniently fits in any bag and is always important when something funny, beautiful, or unusual happens. The Cybershot has an endless amount of  features that can be mixed and matched to make the perfect picture. By fiddling around a little you will stumble upon many scene selections that you camera has. The scenes range from a lens that illuminates and captures fire in all of its brilliance, while in the next picture the snowman that you child just made can be crisp, white, and lifelike all in one.  There are nine scene selections in total all the selections include a view finder meant for large landscapes, night time, night time with a person, snow, a tropical setting, action, and fireworks. If you use these selections right then the picture has the chance of coming out ten times as better as if it were set to a regular lens setting.  Editing can be done right on the camera itself. If the picture needs to be cropped, color altered or removed to create a black and white photo in a couple easy steps it's achieved. If you decide that before the picture is taken you would wish to have it set in black and white or sepia press menus and scroll over a few and you will be able to select color options. Color is not the only thing that the photographer has control over, you can change the focus based on how fine you want the pictures to come out. The song Cybershot has a range of anything from seven millimeter, which assures the best quality of the picture and e-mail size which as crisp and clear but still captures the moment all the same. This camera is not only just a camera, it is also a  video camera. After you are done taking the picture you can upgrade to making the moment last even more with a video clip. The Sony Cybershot can take a movie that is up to an hour long. If you plan on taking an hour long movie, do not plan on taking any pictures. The movies take up a considerable amount of  memory space fast. Though the movies will be worth while, you do not want to have that ruin your ability to continue the day with pictures. I have faced that problem before, my movie was too long and very interesting...therefore I could not take anymore pictures with my friends which was annoying since  I wanted more pictures, but would not delete the movie in its place. I recommend the Sony CyberShot to anyone who loves photography or even memories. It is necessary to capture all the little extra moments in life. This camera eliminates the hassle of using a disposable camera and never knowing how the picture will turn out. You can preview, alter, and delete picture right on the camera at anytime.  The Sony Cybershot is a little pricy but it is more than worth it if you want to have mind-blowing pictures that will last you a lifetime.", "Date": "November 25, 2007"}, {"Title": "Good camera for teens =)", "Author": "Lauren W \"Nernylicious\"", "ReviewID": "R3UL5DDJIY4SFU", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "As a teen, its cool when i can easily take pics of my friends and quickly upload them.

It's small and can be fit in your pocket easy, although I would strongly suggest you buying a case for it. The case has gotten cheaper since I bought it.

The lens went in and out constantly when I turned it on, and meanwhile, the screen was displayed \"Accessing\" or something along that line. The warranty had ran out but the camera broke within 30 days after the warranty was out. So I called the Sony company just to see if they will repair it for me. They eventually made an accommodation for me and and repaired it for me a not charge. Although I did have to pay for shipping to the Sony repair center. When I got my camera back from the repair center they gave me a 90 days warranty.Over all, I am still very satisfied with it and the Sony company customer service.", "Date": "January 28, 2009"}, {"Title": "I love it!

Then, I brought the camera to the beach and the lens would not stay open-- the camera would read \"access, please power on and power off\". Apparently you are not supposed to expose the camera to sand. My old camera was at the beach 6 times a summer and never had an issue.  I took the camera to the repair shop and after a $25 estimate was told that it would take $125 to fix a $175 camera. Frustrated, I took a can of forced air and managed to clear the sand out of the lens. If I had to do it again, I would not buy this camera. I have had nothing but problems.

So far I have no complaints, it has pretty much the same functions as the P100, and a much bigger screen which I love. Another review mentioned the buttons being too small and I have to agree, I usually push the playback button with my nail and not my fingertip.I take most pictures with flash so I can't comment on the blurriness a lot of people talk about, but I don't think it's that bad, just a matter of finding the right setting and using a tripod if necessary.

This is my 2nd Sony W55 camera. My first one I bought on ebay used, I should have known better! That one eventually, the lens kept popping in and out and the camera wouldn't function.

This is BY FAR the best quality of pictures! My first digital camera was also a cybershot but it was a 3.2mp (i forgot which model) It was a good camera, however, not great at close up shots, and evening pics. And eventually, that lens stopped working for me also. Sony has yet to prove me wrong that a good camera can last longer than 3 years!!! If you do ebay, as I used to in the past, this is a GREAT camera for that!!! I used to have to always \"fix\" my pictures after I took shots. This camera, I never have to do any editing. I ALWAYS have red eyes in everyone's cameras, this one. I haven't seen one picture yet! Maybe I've been lucky to take pictures in better lighting perhaps. Anyhow, the reason I got this camera is of course the reviews, but my biggest reason is for evening/dark shots. Takes FABULOUS night shots!!! I also have an Olympus FE-210 takes good pictures, however the night shots. IMPOSSIBLE!  Anyhow, for the price, this is really a great camera.

Use a 2GB memory stick and the photos have been great.  But, my kids love it so much they take it up skiing and use it for videos - so I never see my camera anymore.  So I bought one of my own with some frequent flyer miles and I'm still very happy with this camera.  Was trying to hold out for a Nikon D40 but the itch got to me and I've never been very good with an SLR so Sony it is.  My new camera arrived, works perfectly out of the box, and today I look on Sony's web site to find out you can't buy this little guy from them anymore.  So if you want one, get it quick before it gets replaced with more bells and whistles.  This does everything I need it to, and the menu system is easy to use.  My only drawback - my older eyes need reader glasses so I have to hold it at arms length to read the setting dials.  Just got a monopod for it and I'm looking forward to shooting some kids' baseball games this year.  Battery packs are really solid and hold a charge.  I have 5 between the two cameras but have never run out of battery life yet.  Make sure you fully charge the packs when they come to you, before you start using them.

I used it to take pictures of my lovebird in extreme close-up and she came out beautifully. The details of her feathers all showed and her beak shined.

I was surprised by how well it works in low lighting, indoors, without flash. Of course light is still needed and the subject can't be shadowed but if your taking pictures indoors, at night, with a bit of light (say a Christmas tree or at a dim restaurant), then the picture will come out naturally and visible.Disadvantages: Doesn't take excellent faraway pictures with the zoom option mainly because the zoom is weak.

Also, I have never had a problem with taking blurry photos in the past, and nearly all of the photos I took with this camera came out with at least 1/4 of the photo blurry.  I say only 1/4 because there were some very strange effects that happened in most of the photos.  Some how, only the corner of the photo would be blurry or half of a person was blurry and not like they were moving.Additionally, while it has some new flash options that my Fuji didn't have, none of them work as well as the basic ones on my Fuji.  Almost all the people I took photos of with this camera had red eyes, the flash was so very bright, that I really blinded them.  And overall it just didn't look good on the photos.This camera does take excellent movies even in the same situations that it didn't take good photos in.  They have great sound and the focus is GREAT in those.

The camera can take so many amazing out standing photos that has been great to show family and friends. This camera is great for anyone who loves taking photos or who just wants to remember their memories.The settings on this camera are hard to figure out at first but as you play with camera more it becomes easier and a lot more fun to have. There are many settings for the seasons, weather, time of day, and whether you are indoors or outdoors. When changing these settings the camera may adjust to the correct scenery but if wrong settings are set to the wrong scenery than the camera may not adjust as well. Also with the settings is the zoom. The zoom is great because it can zoom in very close and zoom out very far. It is very affective and great. Even when there is a picture saved and you need it to be zoomed in closer you can zoom in on that image and make it show even better.When saving pictures its easy with just a press of a button. The camera may be a small little device but it stores a lot of pictures and videos. It also has a small memory stick that holds a lot of pictures and videos so there is twice the storage.This camera is not only tiny but is very lightweight. It can be stored in your purse back pocket, shirt pocket, and other places too. It comes in three different colors silver, black and even pink.This camera is just a great way to remember life when looking at the crisp clear pictures. I use this camera all the time and have never regretted purchasing it. It is just amazing that an item so small can achieve so much and make people happier with their pictures especially with showing their family and friends.
