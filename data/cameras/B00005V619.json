{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Amazing for the size!", "Author": "A Customer", "ReviewID": "R2HNASDKG0693C", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "GOOD THINGS: You don't appreciate how small this thing is until you sit it next to any other real digital camera on the market. I have two Olympus models, a C-2040Z and a Brio D-150. I thought the D-150 was small, but the Dimage X makes it seem huge in comparison. It even makes the Canon ELPHs seem porky. This camera is easy to use with simple menus and intuitive controls. I had it all figured it out in just a few minutes without looking at the manual. If you have Windows 2000, ME or XP, you just plug it into your USB port and it pops up on \"My Computer\"--no software drivers required. It's very quick to turn on (no lens to extend) and is reasonably quick at taking pictures depending on the image size/quality and if you're using the flash. The flash can take about 6 seconds to recycle but that's typical. It has a \"multiple shot\" mode as well. Commonly used controls like the flash mode, display on/off and exposure correction are accessible directly without using the menus. There are only 4 menus and they're really easy to navigate. You can choose from 3 image sizes and 4 quality levels including an uncompressed TIFF mode. Battery life seems AMAZINGLY good given that the battery is literally the size of some postage stamps! I ran around for over an hour with the display on taking tons of pics, downloading them, messing with the menus, etc. before it gave me a low battery warning. The reviews say you can leave it on all day with the display off and take several hundred pictures all on one charge. The case is nearly all stainless steel. It should stand up to a fair amount of use/abuse. The lens is covered by a sliding motorized door when it's off. There should be less to break/go wrong compared to cameras that have to extend the lens every time you turn them on. BAD THINGS: My biggest gripe is the picture quality. Other [more expensive] two megapixel cameras are significantly better. My Olympus C-2040Z takes sharper pictures with fewer artifacts under any conditions and completely blows the Minolta away in low light. With a much bigger (conventional) lens, however, that's to be expected. The Dimage X images are a bit \"soft\"--especially in the corners and edges. You don't really notice it on most casual shots, but if there's fine detail in the corners and along the edges, it's a bit fuzzy. Perhaps more annoying, there are \"chromatic artifacts\" visible in many pictures. These seem to be worse at the wide angle end of the zoom range. You get either a red, yellow or blue band next to sharp high contrast lines. This is likely due to the prism used to \"fold\" the lens and from keeping the weird lens design so small. It's part of the price you have to pay (at least right now) for a camera this compact. There are reviews on the net that have samples pictures that show this flaw quite clearly. ... The lens has a smaller maximum aperture than many comparable lenses on bigger cameras so it forces the Dimage X to use slower shutter speeds to make up for it. This means camera shake is more of a problem in lower light. It also means it can't focus as well in low light and the LCD viewfinder doesn't work as well either. The charger is a standalone unit and while fairly small, requires a plug in cord. It's just one more thing to travel with. You have to take the battery out of the camera to charge it. There's no manual focus mode (there is a focus lock where you can focus on something else, hold the shutter button part way down, and then take the picture). In really low light, like most digital cams, it can't focus at all--at least it defaults to 6 feet. The LCD display washes out more than some do in bright outdoor light. At least they give you a shortcut to the menu to adjust the brightness. You also have to push a button twice every time you turn on the camera if you want to turn the display off to greatly extend the battery life. The flash is kind of weak (or the small lens is hurting it) as the flash is only good to about 8 - 10 feet or so and even then the edges are darker at the wide angle zoom setting. There's no manual white balance, just presets. So if you're in tricky lighting, you're stuck. The auto setting also tends to be on the warm side under most conditions. This isn't a huge deal as you can always tweak the color later on your PC. OTHER STUFF: Extra batteries are still hard to find, ... . You'll want one. ...you might want to buy a cheap card reader instead [of an AC adapter]. MMC/SD cards are more expensive than SmartMedia and CF, but they make sense for this camera because they're much smaller. I doubt Minolta could have found room for the older flash cards. Besides, MMC/SD will keep dropping in price I'm sure--they're the newest technology right now. There is a note in the manual that MMC cards take longer to store pictures than SD (which is due to the card design). CONCLUSION: It's not perfect, but it's currently in a class by itself. The Canon ELPHs take slightly better pictures but are significantly bigger. If this is going to be your ONLY (or your best) digital camera, you hopefully put a much higher priority on size/portability rather than image quality and elaborate features. If it's going to be a second camera for more casual use, it's an excellent choice. I take this camera places I'd never take my C-2040 or even the D-150 Brio. What good is a nice camera if it always stays home? I'm sure other manufactures will follow with their own ultra compact digital models. Minolta will improve on this one as well. But as a first effort, it's pretty amazing. If image quality is a big priority, I'd look at the cheaper Olympus C-2040Z or Canon A20. If you want something that's small with slightly better quality than the Dimage X, consider a Canon ELPH. If small/light/easy are big priorities, the Dimage X may be well worth buying.", "Date": "November 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "Good snapshot/party camera, and wow size does matter.", "Author": "J. Lambert", "ReviewID": "R1OY6LNENHVZ12", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Let me start by saying I use to teach photography at college and an a critic as far as picture quality goes.  A college of mind bought this camera and I was so impressed with the size and features I figured what the heck I'll give it a shot because my Cannon G1 is just to big to carry with me all the time.  One of the most important feature to me was size, I wanted something I could carry around.  This covered it, it is small, wow is it small and light.  It's slender body fits into my pocket and I forget it is there.  As a result I shoot more pics.  The other nice feature is the quick worm up time of about a sec.  Cameras I have had in the past I missed shots because they were booting up.  This camera has a exceptional exposure control in low light, it is hard to take a bad picture.Now for the down side.  The picture quality is OK.  I find it a bit smooth and not crisp enough for my taste, but nothing photoshop can't fix.  I miss a volume control on the shutter it is either on or off and there are no shortcuts to the menu items to quickly toggle features or delete frames.  The view window on the back is fixed and a bit small and dark sometimes, mostly in low light.  Also when shooting movies the mic is on the top of the camera rather than the front so if you are in a busy room it pics up everything else as loud as the people you trying to shoot.  Over all for the size it is awesome.  I would call it a excellent party, snapshot type camera.  If I lost it I would go out and buy another one without hesitastion.", "Date": "April 1, 2002"}, {"Title": "Get it. Now.", "Author": "Bernhard Faber \"Craft\"", "ReviewID": "R3PWP82SLQ60A1", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I have been looking for a digital camera for a month or so now. When I saw the first comments on the DIMAGE X I really wanted this camera badly. Then I found a couple of extensive reviews that rate the camera only average. A special concern with these reviewers was the \"poor picture quality\", especially the \"softness\". I became quite skeptical and started to lean more towards buying the Canon S 110. Then I learned that the Canon (although receiving recommended and highly recommended ratings) produces pictures that suffer from very noticeable \"chromatic aberrations\". I looked at sample images and decided that this was a much worse flaw than the allegedly \"soft\" images of the X. So when the X became available I bought it from a store with a generous return policy and decided to test it on my own and, if unsatisfactorily, return it. Well, it is a keeper. Here are my reasons: First and foremost: Design. Oh my God, especially in Manhattan it is not easy to make people turn their heads, but when you elegantly pull the X out of your pocket, they will. Guaranteed. The aluminum and steel case is very sturdy. Only the little lens protector that moves up so boldly to protect the lens when you turn the camera off is a little flimsy. Also you have to get used to holding the camera a little differently with your left hand than you would naturally, or you will get in contact with the lens and block the picture.Secondly, operation. Everything about this little thing is well thought out. Read the manual and you are in control in an hour or so. I only have some minor concerns about the ease of use. The position of the important enter button requires you to take your fingers of the scroll buttons or use both hands, which is rather awkward and makes navigating the menus a bit more cumbersome than necessary.Thirdly, picture quality. Sorry professional reviewer guys. You really got this one wrong. Again, dear fellow non professional picture takers, read the manual and experiment a little bit. After maybe an hour of trying or so I was able to make perfectly sharp, nice pictures. If you use the zoom to reduce or enhance perspective and play a little with the exposure times, you can even get some dramatic photographic effects. So for me it is not only a little snap-shooter, but a camera that truly satisfies not only my photographic needs, but also the most hefty cravings for attention...at least for the next few months, until everybody will have one of those little sweet X fellows. Get it. It's good. ...", "Date": "March 18, 2002"}, {"Title": "Perfect package, less than perfect image quality...", "Author": "R. Thompson \"sixseven\"", "ReviewID": "R3ELZ6GPKB7RF5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Having had many other small cameras in the past -- from tiny Minoxes to the latest Kyocera S3 -- I was really looking forward to having a small digital camera I could keep with me at all times.The Dimage X is a stunning little package; anyone who sees it wants to pick it up, hold it, and play with it.  The design and finish are first-rate. The size, though -- that's what this camera is all about.  It's the first digicam to use an internal zoom mechanism, which allows the X to be ridiculously slim.  Other cameras might have a slightly smaller \"footprint\" but the X wins where it counts -- it is so slim you forget it's in your pocket.  As a result it is very easy to keep with you at all times.The Dimage X works very well in daily use.  The most important convenience is its' speed.  Many other cameras simply take too long to turn on, or have very long wait times as they record an image.  The little Minolta is among the swiftest of cameras in these regards.  It also allows you to fire off several frames in rapid succession; it appears to allow around five pictures, then pauses to record them to memory.  This is very handy when your trying to capture something elusive -- children, for example.The X's lithium-ion batteries give what I consider very long run-times before expiring.  In comparison to another small digicam, the Kyocera S3, the Dimage X offers approximately double the battery life.  It gives ridiculously long run times with the LCD display switched off; the camera's internal electronics seem very well designed and appear to operate very efficiently.  The camera never feels hot to the touch (or even warm, for that matter); I noticed this was a problem with the Kyocera, which may account for it's short run-times.The only thing I dislike about the Dimage X is its' image quality.  To keep the zoom mechanism inside the camera required the use of a prism.  This limits the camera from being as sharp, ultimately, as a conventional camera, and also leads to slightly less contrast and color saturation in the images.  To qualify this review I should admit to being a perfectionist who is reluctant to EVER compromise on image quality.  In this case the size and packaging of this camera have won me over.  With further refinement the Minolta Dimage X could approach perfection; as it stands it's one great little camera that will accompany you everywhere.", "Date": "March 19, 2002"}, {"Title": "I LOVE IT!", "Author": "Julie", "ReviewID": "R1HKXQA4LBZJ9E", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I just bought the Dimage X 2 weeks ago and I can't put it down!  I love it!  When I set out to buy a digital camera for my trip to Europe, I wanted something very small that printed like Walgreens minus the pesky dust.  I found it.  I don't even have a photo quality printer, but it looks like I do.  All my friends have seen it and they're in awe.  I'm even reluctant to let people hold it because I'm afraid they might drop it, so I make them wear the wrist strap at all times.  I teach a photography course, so I know a lot about SLR cameras and photography in general. I know a good print when I see one. And the Dimage X is anything but \"soft\" as some of the other reviewers have said.  But I'm just getting in to the digital revolution.  Compared to my big, bulky SLR, the Dimage is a needle.  I'm even finding it hard to go back.  The little 35 second movie mode is an added bonus.  Plus you can record voice clips to your pictures.  It also takes either SD memory cards or MultiMedia Cards (MMC).  The SD cards are also used in other devices as well, so you can alternate back and forth. I upgraded to a 128 SD card so I have enough space. The battery has a long life. The software is easy to use and the pictures transfer quickly. The menu is easy to navigate and I've found that it takes amazing, true to life pictures without even having to alter anything on the computer.  I reccommend that you buy the carrying case because you will be very protective of the little X.  I've had no trouble whatsoever with this camera.  It's definitely the life of the party!

First of all it's small, perhaps the smallest 2-megapixel digicam on the American market today.  I still have my Canon S100 but this one is not only thinner but also lighter -- and the battery life is longer, too!The second most amazing thing is even though the camera lens does not move, it *is* capable of 3X true *optical* zoom!!  This is accomplished through an internal movable prism.  Simply an ingenious piece of work!  This means two things: fast zoom, and less distortion.The camera is quite fast in saving images (max resolution is 1600x1200, just like the Canon S100) to the SD card.  It takes about 1-1.5 seconds between pictures when flash is used and around 1 sec when flash is off.Picture quality is *excellent*!  One gripe I have about the S100 is the image quality is so so, especially in low-light conditions.  The DiMage X easily ranks among the high-quality digital pictures.  Images are sharp and color-rich.  You can also make exposure compensation if you feel the picture is slightly over or under exposed.This is one awesome camera!  Its unique shape, extraordinary compactness and awesome picture quality make it simply the best consumer digital camera.", "Date": "March 17, 2002"}, {"Title": "Dimage X - good all around camera", "Author": "CC \"CCN\"", "ReviewID": "R2ATCFEYCYBJ25", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I got and enjoys it.  Here's my assessment of the Dimage X.First, ...The CONS:- There seems to be lacking a manual focus to \"infinity\" for taking pictures out of a window (not that it happens alot, but...).  Maybe there is, but I can't find it.- I would like a little more \"sharpness.\" (All current digital cameras suffers from a lack of sharpness, even the 3 MP cameras...it could be JPG-related because I haven't really seen any digital camera that gives sharp pics without software processing.)- Because it's so small it's easy to move while pressing the button (if you're loaded with caffeine!) thereby further decreasing the sharpness.- The software is \"powerful\" but it requires time to learn how to use it properly.- Battery is propriety and I'm not sure how long it REALLY lasts and it does seem to use alot of power (LCD display, navigating the menu, downloading pics, playing with the 3x zoom lens).  Eventually, you'll want to buy another battery/charger as backup.  You should also get a memory card reader when it's offered free (with rebate) and save on the power wasted on downloading pics to PC.  (Heck! get 2--keep one in the office.  Your PDA could use it also.)THE PROS:- It's small and flat (fits in shirt pocket) and handy to carry around wherever.  More photo-ops.- It's sturdy and looks cool.- It has a \"superfine\" TIF mode (no loss...supposedly).- 3x optical zoom is cool.- The automatic lens protector looks and sounds cool when it opens/closes--like a James Bond gadget.- Battery charges in 80 minutes.VERDICT:Kind of pricey compared with the recent price drops in the 3MP cameras, but chances are you won't like carrying those cameras around.  The Dimage X's a decent \"general purpose\" camera you would LIKE to carry around and which can also be used for serious picture taking (in TIF mode).  (Many of those other cameras don't have a TIF mode--just a higher JPG mode.)  It's more than just a novelty.

Shreck", "ReviewID": "R3JSUPN1SS24XM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "THE GOOD:The highlight of this camera is of course the size. It is super small, super easy to carry around in a shirt pocket, or for a lady to put in a small purse for a night out on the town. It is a DEFINITE attention getter. I went out to dinner with my girl, and about 20 people asked about it (too bad I was with my girl cause 19/20 were chicks ha ha)...I am far from being a professional photographer, but I am very impressed with the quality of the pictures, and the ability to take them in 3 different sizes (1600x1200, 1280x960, 640x480) and 4 different quality modes (super fine, fine, standard, economy)...Another pro is the ability to upload the pictures from the camera to u'r computer. You can use the USB cable that comes with it, power it on once its connected to your PC, and automatically window will pop up asking you to tranfer the files from cam to PC (I use win XP)...THE BAD:The software that came with this camera was a waste of programmer's hours to develop. Better off using windows PAINT, and if your lucky and have XP, better to create a Pictures folder and maintain the photo's there. Not much ability with the software that came with it. Its not pretty to use, and doesn't give you much editing ability. If you already have Photoshop or MS Draw, or any decent photo editing software, then you are good to go.It was also hard to take pictures using the LCD in the dark. For obvious reasons - the screen was pitch black. You would need to take the picture first, and then preview it in the LCD to see if you got the person or have to retake it. But you can shut off the LCD feature and use the viewfinder to take u'r nite shots. THE UGLY:The ugly is the price. I paid around [$$$] for the camera in April 2002, then bought a matching clip on carrying case for another [$$$], then a 2nd battery for it for another [$$$] (which I lost and had to buy yet ANOTHER battery), plus I bought a 128MB SD memory card for [$$$] cause 8MB wasn't cutting it (now I can put almost 2000 pictures on the card in standard mode)...so bottom line, the camera with a few accessories ended up being around $500. But that is still not too bad for this camera, and the price has DEFINITELY dropped since April, you can probably get it for around [$$$] if you look hard enough.The JUDGEMENT:This camera overall ROCKS! for being someone's first digital camera. The price has gone down, it is VERY much a fasionable item for guys and girls, GUARANTEED to be approached by someone to ask about it or hear side comments like \"wow that is a awesome camera\"...The quality is great for being 2.11MB, which is plenty for a first timer.

One flaw", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "RXL713RZPFUYR", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I am new to the Digital camera thing, so I wanted something convenient, and easy to use. I was looking at this camera and the Elph. This won, because it's smaller, has a movie function, and a 3X optical zoom. The Elph 200 has no movie function, and has a 2X optical zoom. Optical is better then Digital zoom (less grain).  This camera is pretty much plug and play. I had to read a few of the instructions to understand some of the things, but it seems really straight forward. Do not use the top setting. It is a waste of space. It is the same data as the Fine setting, just Uncompressed. The pictures 4X6 come out looking exactly the same. But you can fit only 28 pictures on a 128 card, instead of 130 pictures at the Fine setting.  As soon as you buy this Camera, go on line and do a search for a 256MB Secure Digital (SD) Card. It costs about [price]. It's the best card out there for the money, and you will not find the 256MB in stores. You can find a 512 card on line, but it is[price]. That's just as expensive as the camera! The camera comes with an 8MB card. You can take 3 pictures with this thing, then it's full, get a bigger card. You WILL want it.  The ONE flaw with this camera, and this REALLY bothers me, is the stupid Battery light. Whoever designed this thing, should be forced to use a bad universal remote, for the rest of their life! Most battery levels, have a picture of a battery, that is broken into sections, and each section disappears as the battery runs out of life. Easy to understand, right? This camera has a battery symbol, that is white when full, then light gray when half full, then Red when you have 5 minutes left. I challenge anyone to tell the difference between White, and light gray on a battery symbol that small.  Buy an extra battery. You WILL need it. And buy the nice pouch, it has a pocket for the extra battery in it. I love this camera. I hate the battery symbol.  Good thing is.... The battery can charge fully in about 45 minutes. That's fast.The camera comes with a Battery Charger, USB cable, Software for viewing the pictures on your computer, a Lithium battery, and an 8MB card.  You need to buy a case,  another battery (If you use it all day), and a  much larger Memory Card (nothing less then 128MB). They sell an AC adapter, but it's really not needed.

I got one about a month ago in February. I really like the unique design and its compact size.  Here are some of the pros and cons in my opinion. Lets start with the cons.CONs:- Takes a while to switch from one shooting mode to another (ex: from single shot to movie mode). It is a lot easier on the sony DSC series cameras.- I have gotten use to the small size and learned quickly to becareful about not covering the lens with my finger.  However, when someone else is taking a picture for me, most of the time their finger blocks a portion of the lens.- You can't preview anything if you're taking a picture in low light conditions.  I like how some Sony's shine an orange light before you take the shot so you see what you're taking.- Menu isn't hard to learn but isn't the most efficient style I've seen.Now for the PROs:- I really really like the design of Dimage X. Very modern and unique and just plain cool.- Very small in size and light weight. Everywhere I go its always in my pocket.  - Amazingly good zoom (3x optical) for such a small camera. And plus the internal zoom design allows the small camera to stay small all the time.- The battery life is very good.  I always have the LCD screen on when I use the camera and I haven't had the battery run out on me.- Movie mode records images as well as sound. Also theres a speaker for you to preview the movie with sound.- Theres a motorized metal lens cover that protects your lens. Its really fun to watch the lens cover go down to reveal the lens when you turn the camera on and also when it goes back up when you turn it off. (You'll see what I'm talking about after you get the camera)- Image quality in my opinion is more than enough for my needs. I mainly use the pictures for internet use and occasionally print out the pictures on photo paper.  2.11 mega pixels is more than enough if those are your intentions also.- The camera powers up and is ready to take a picture almost immediately after you turn it on.  This is a plus for a camera you're always carrying around. - Theres not a big lag between taking shots, compared to the Canon s200.I'm sure theres plenty more Pro's but I'm still learning about the camera.  The camera always turns curious heads every time I take it out. So besides the cons I mentioned above, which really arent too big of a deal, this is the perfect camera for me.", "Date": "March 15, 2003"}, {"Title": "Listen! just read this review:", "Author": "L.

The only \"problem\" you need to solve is finding a plug adaptor for the charger, since it will not fit in most of the spanish plugs. And this will happen in any other european country (UK, Ireland...) No problem at all with the voltage. Regarding the camera I am really satisfied with it. It is not only slim, quick and reliable, but ultra-cool and trendy (and takes good pictures too :-). You just need an extra battery, and at least a 64 MB SD Card.

Personally I only ever use the flash every once in a while and this is so annoying. I Prefer somewhat dark photos over those harsh flash lit ones every time. So the \"ultra fast start up\" that Minolta touts becomes moot if you have to click 3 or more times just to get the flash not to go off.Also, the menu interface, like all digital cameras for some reason, is badly designed, requiring two hands to operate. Often it is not clear what you have selected because, for example, if you have only two choices and your selection only changes colour it is unclear which colour represents 'selected' Does the grey mean it's selected or does the pink?

A college of mind bought this camera and I was so impressed with the size and features I figured what the heck I'll give it a shot because my Cannon G1 is just to big to carry with me all the time.  One of the most important feature to me was size, I wanted something I could carry around.  This covered it, it is small, wow is it small and light.  It's slender body fits into my pocket and I forget it is there.  As a result I shoot more pics.  The other nice feature is the quick worm up time of about a sec.  Cameras I have had in the past I missed shots because they were booting up.  This camera has a exceptional exposure control in low light, it is hard to take a bad picture.Now for the down side.  The picture quality is OK.  I find it a bit smooth and not crisp enough for my taste, but nothing photoshop can't fix.  I miss a volume control on the shutter it is either on or off and there are no shortcuts to the menu items to quickly toggle features or delete frames.  The view window on the back is fixed and a bit small and dark sometimes, mostly in low light.  Also when shooting movies the mic is on the top of the camera rather than the front so if you are in a busy room it pics up everything else as loud as the people you trying to shoot.  Over all for the size it is awesome.  I would call it a excellent party, snapshot type camera.

When I give the camera to other people to take pictures, sometimes they put their finger over the lens.  Since the camera is small some people's fat fingers get in the way.

But bottom line, will you wish you'd taken a different camera with you when you look at the pictures later?I haven't purchased this camera; I considered it strongly until I saw sample images on several camera review sites.  On every single one, it goes completely soft in the corners of every shot.  It's a limitation of the lens, and once you see it you always see it.  I found myself vowing to deal with the greater bulk of my Canon S30 and coming home with pictures worth saving.And for those who say it's a great \"party camera\" -- look, either a picture's worth taking or it isn't...and if it's worth taking, don't take a blurry one!", "Date": "November 10, 2002"}, {"Title": "Got this for my child", "Author": "Jeremy", "ReviewID": "R99ZDY9R5KH2O", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My young daughter wanted a camera of her own.

Menu is intuitive, transferring images can be done with ease, even for the not-so-tech-savvy. The zoom is pretty good too. Battery is Li-Ion, lasts for pretty long time. LCD is bright and clear, if a bit small, but what do you expect from a camera that was the smallest 2MP camera available when it was released? Some may complain about how much control they have over the how the photo is taken (ie, light, focus, etc.) In short, great camera for take anywhere, do-almost-everything photography.
