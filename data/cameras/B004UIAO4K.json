The instructions are good but the follow along video instructions are even better. The only complaints that i have are that the DNS system that talk you through setting up is outdated. The company no longer supports or offers the free version. It is now a yearly fee, though the cost is under $30 a year (as of december of 2012). and there is nothing describing how to long in over the web and view the cameras.", "Date": "January 1, 2013"}, {"Title": "Foscam Tech Support", "Author": "Jen S. \"Jen\"", "ReviewID": "RE20USQ7GZ8SQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased the Foscam 4 camera system recently to help watch over my home when I am at work.  I received the camera system in 2 days since I ordered through the Amazon Prime option.  The delivery was very fast.  Once I received the cameras I was a little confused on how to set them up.  I called the support number in the owners manual.  After a short wait Christina answered and helped me set up the ENTIRE system.  She was great!  The tech support was WAY beyond my expectation!!!  I have yet to use the system completely, but for now... I am really impressed!  Thank you Christina for helping my set up all four cameras, my computer, AND my iPad.  I truly appreciate her patience and remote help.", "Date": "August 13, 2013"}, {"Title": "It's a fair deal", "Author": "Igor Dunar", "ReviewID": "R5H190Z5QAXCW", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Only 3 out of four worked, little bit klugy to set up.
