I am a freelance photographer shooting a lot of drama, music and dance events during stage performances.  I bought and used the earlier Sony Mavica FD-91 with the image stabelized 10x zoom. People loved the closeup and personal images I could capture with it. However, at .8 Megapixels, the FD-91 was limited to smaller prints, and the 3.5\" floppy disk had to be changed every 10 shots or so.  This new Sony CD1000 has same high quality zoom, plus 2.1 Megapixel capture for larger prints, external flash ability and a 156MB CD-R mini disk to store the pictures on.  I get over 160 high quality images shooting the same 3:2 aspect ratio as traditional 35mm cameras.But Sony, if you want five star reviews, read on...  You will have to shorten the 1/2 second delay and viewer blackout after pressing the shutter release until the image is captured.  I have to anticipate where a subject will be, take the picture and hope.  And, if miss my shot, which happens a lot, I have to wait 3 seconds until I can try again. Sony, add some RAM memory, let us take three or four fast pictures in a row, then store them.  You are so close.", "Date": "October 20, 2000"}, {"Title": "It's a still shot camera only", "Author": "Ken McKenzie", "ReviewID": "R19UO6NNFOJI39", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I've had mine for over a month and shot 4 disks full. Many of the shots are amazingly good (I'm the one amazed) and the instant feedback so you can show your subject the picture is a real plus. We took the grandkids for a Christmas tree light tour the other night and when we got back, we just connected the CD1000 cable to the TV set and there were the Christmas lights for my daughter and son in law to see, with the grandkids filling in the play by play.  Grandpa and grandma got lots of points.The after-market CD-Rs not only are more than 1/4 the price of Sony, but they hold 200MB vs the standard 156MB. A warning does come up, recommending Sony Mavica disks, but all work fine, including downloads into the PC.The economics of CD-R photo storage is incredible. The CD-R stores about the same as 4-5 rolls of 36 exposure 35mm film, even at the highest JPEG resolution setting for the CD1000. That's about $16-$20 just for 35mm film, not counting processing or printing vs the cost of the disk which is about 80 cents.The bad stuff:(1)The CD1000 cannot put up with even slow motion activity shooting. Basically, when you slightly depress the shutter, a green light comes on and the image \"freezes\", ready for the final press of the shutter to store \"that\" image, right?  Not so. The green light and the frozen image simply \"charges\" the CCD array and when you press the shutter further to actually take the shot, the CCD receives whatever image is presented through the lens.  If all is still, no problem, but if the image is moving, like at a social event, you come out with part of an arm, leg, or the back of a head or two. This takes a while to adapt to and if you're planning to use the CD1000 for a sporting event camera, forget it.(2)Associated with the above problem, is the image in the view finder and LCD screen goes to freeze or blank when the shutter is activated so any action is lost.  The view finder is a small LCD and not an optical look through the lens. Sure, on 35mm cams we lose the image during the shot, but only for the shutter speed.  With the CD1000, you're off for as long as the CD-R write cycle takes, about 1 to 5 seconds.(3)The flash \"hot shoe\" is not.  It's only a bracket to attach Sony's own CD1000 optional flash that's non-standard via their interrconnect cord. That means all those smart flashes for our 35mm won't work.  BTW, the CD1000 built in flash is good for about 5 feet with lots of controls. However, when the flash is up, the CD1000 compensates it's exposure and darkens the shot for longer distance. Better to make 2 shots, one with flash, another without, just for safety.(4)Connecting the CD1000 to USB sounds and is simple. However, in very small type on pg.32, a warning that no other device be plugged into the other USB port. So if you have an HP Scanner already plugged in to USB and want to connect the CD1000 to the other port, forget it. I've heard sometimes it works. My installation issued \"the blue screen of death\" under Windows 98 SE.  A call to Sony Tech Support, reminded me to \"read the manual\", even the fine print.  This goes against the industry standard USB spec, but Sony says the CD1000 must \"own\" the USB environment and that's the way it is.Other than (1-4), the CD1000 is still a great camera. Flexible to a fault, lots of storage, great shot economics (except the price of the camera), and Sony quality. I'll stay with it, even with it's faults.", "Date": "December 17, 2000"}, {"Title": "Finally - a digital camera worth buying", "Author": "K. Mears", "ReviewID": "R3MQZ06RGKIFJL", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Mavica CD1000 is as good as it sounds. The 10x optical zoom is terrific (don't bother with 'digital zoom'. If you want pixelation, you'd be using a low-res camera). The 'steady shot' works well, the 'twilight-plus' flashless function is no less than magical (although you will need a tripod). And it's just plain cool!The best thing about it is the cost/picture. You need the battery that comes with it, (maybe a backup -I got a 4 hour for less than ...), a protective lense filter (a uv filter costs about ...), and some mini cdr discs (comes with 5). No memory cards, smart cards or equivalent! Look around and you will be able to find the mini cd's for somewhere under .../disc (don't look and you will pay about .../disc in a case). I paid ... for 50 minis on a spindle (no cases) delivered to my door. Now, you will take somewhere between 140 and 180 high res (1200 x 1600) pictures on each disc (minus whatever you useup taking mini mpegs). So, lets be conservative. Assuming the low of 140 images/disc, and the high of ... for 50 discs, that works out to less than one penny/shot. And the images are NOT low value! I took two shots, one using the tiff sorage format  (taking 40 seconds to write a 5 Mb file to disc), and the other the std. High res jpeg. In plate by plate comparison, the jpeg was so close to the tiff as to make the extra time and disc space of the tiff format unnecessary. I have been in digital pre-press for 15 years, and these shots are equivalent to quality 4x5 scans.Once you get used to the <1 second delay from first touch to shutter, you will be taking great shots, and lots of them. The delay can be eliminated in most cases by half pressing the button, allowing the auto focus to set up, then when you push, the shot is instantaneous. You'll quickly figure out where and when to turn off the auto focus and rely on distance read outs etc. You will want to get a UV filter for this camera before you take it out of the box. Not to improve your pictures, but to protect your lense. Replacing the lense on an intgrated digital system like this will probably cost as much as the camera itself. The uv lense can be replaced for ... .Anyway, I have used some 'high-end' Kodak DCS professional series cameras in the past, and some low end digitals as well.

I had a chance to test and try several digital cameras from 1 Megapixel to 3 Megapixel but never own one. I prefer something similar to my SLR cameras not an instant camera. So I decide to buy this sony,well, I have this camera since May 2001. At first, I had to adjust myself to get along with control panel, electronic viewfinder. It took about only 20-30 minutes to learn to whole features and getting test. This camera does a really good job on most shots. Feeling like taking by SLR camera, for examples-feeling when take shots, lighting and vivid output. It has a problem with low-light situations when seeing from viewfinder or LCD panel, but doing twilight plus technique (one of nice features in this camera) I can shoot night time photo with no problems - with flash / without flash. Also lag-time wasn't any problem for me because I used to test some other digital cameras that having this delaying picture. By pressing HALF-SHUTTER and waiting for nice moment will solve problem. Excellent zoom (Optical+Digital) - very impressive image stabilizer. About the battery life, I can use it the whole day(taking photos for 2.5 hours) when I went out. It's very ok to me because other cameras that I've used consume very much battery power (one hour and that's it). Moreover, I don't have to worry about my storage for pics and don't worry about when to upload photos to my PC. They're already there and permanently stored, that's why I don't have to make some more backing up to CD Media again and again (if I use wired-memory media cam). Once again in Thailand, we can get one 3\"-CD for a price only 1 US dollar. I am very happy with it then. I made my good decision on this great camera.Conclusion: Great Picture quality, Great battery life and hugh storage. Low-light shooting + Motion may be some problem but need to adjust shutter speed and your own shooting techniques. Excellent zoom.

Recording photos on the 3\" disc is what separates this camera from the rest. At the highest reolution you can take 150 pictures on one disc - amazing. You now have a permanent record without any need to take up any computer space. You can put it on \"picture show\" and look at every photo on your projection TV and they all look great. If you don't like the angle-rotate the photo. You don't like the photo, delete it. The 10x telephoto with steady shot is great. I would not buy any digital camera without a CD storage system and this is the only camera that has it, as far as I know. In the summer of 2001 Sony will be coming out with smaller CD-R cameras without the long telephoto you have on this camera. The only drawback to the 1000 is the 1 second delay between pressing the button and taking the picture. It takes planning at times and sometimes you get odd results. Just delete the photo and do it again if the photo is poor. All in all a great camera. Last Saturday I took 150 photos at a wedding in Hyannis.

I was also dissapointed to see the 15-60 second limit on recording time.However, as soon as I pulled this one together and took it out, I was absolutelty thrilled.  I use this one a lot for nature shots, getting pictures of the ocean, trees, cliffs and that kind of thing.  Without filters this camera seems to take some of the more amazingly vivid pictures I have seen.  The LCD display does little justice to the shot, but once you hook it up to your computer and wait the 30 or 40 minutes it takes to transmit all the pictures with the software included, your eyes will be pleasantly suprised.  The size does not bother me at all, even though I thought it would have.  I have had no problem with that other then the fact that I cannot fit this one in my coat pocket or something.  The weight seems about the same as a soda can, and even standing there waiting for the perfect shot to come along with the camera to my face for a good twenty minutes did not make my arms tired.  All of my friends are always very impressed, and dying to see the new pictures that I have taken.  I enjoy the media, being only that its a very cool thing to be carrying the three inch cd's around.  As well as the 156 meg size on them.  A pack of 5 of them will cost you 20 bucks, plus the camera comes with 5.  I have taken over 200 shots and I'm only halfway through my second disc.  I've had it since December.  No, you cannot delete the pictures, but if you're going from a film camera this will not matter too much.  The case is a bit of a joke.  Its a bikeseat for 50$.  The battery life is about 140 minutes fully charged with the LCD off in camera mode.

The looks of envy from other camera owners is just the start. Using this camera is pure joy. I've taken 293 pics so far on the 1st of 5 discs included.I've found that the 640 x 480 resolution looks perfect for emails, web site use and printing, and at that resolution I can get over 1000 pictures per disc. The manual states for email it uses a smaller resolution, but what you  display on the LCD can be captured straight onto email or used on your web page.

The slideshow feature is excellent for presentations being the time interval can be set for narrating during playback. And with audio pics you can speak about your subject for up to a minute while taking the picture. Also using the movie mode allows both action shots and sound recording of your event.For birding with a camera, the color viewfinder and 10X optical zoom is excellent for that golden-cheeked warbler in the Texas Hill Country or for hawks at the Cape May Birding Observatory with a picture to show.

This results in far more pictures per event than I would normally have taken.The automatic aspects of the camera work great.  It is extremely rare for a shot to be out of focus or exposed improperly.  Out of appx. 1000 vacation shots I took in August only 1 or 2 were inexplicably out of focus and only a handful more were too dark, and those were due to the lighting conditions themselves being far too dark for taking pictures.The camera is large and bulky compared with almost every other digital camera but is lighter than any SLR I have ever used.  The lens is big and provides a remarkably wide range (10x optical times 2 digital - total 20x zoom - excellent).  Shots taken at 20x zoom are not pixelated in the least!At the highest resolution I get somewhere between perhaps 100 and 180 images on a third party 3\" CDR (less than $1 each).  At the lowest resolution it looks like one could get in excess of 1000 shots onto a CD.The single drawback I find with this camera is that during a day of really busy shooting it can really drain the rechargable batteries.

It needed more memory and ate batteries like there was no tomorrow. Six months later I purchased this sony and I continue to be delighted with it and am relaxed about the price.  When I added on the cost of extra storage media and batteries that most other cameras demand I concluded that the MVC-CD1000 wasn't so far off the mark after all. I recommend you do not buy the camera case - its shamefully expensive (for a bit of vinyl) and doesn't protect a thing.  Considering the size of the camera I swapped my handbag for a daypack (small backpack) which has several compartments & carries the camera, cables, discs etc plus all my girl stuff - perfect for a day out or holidaying as my main bag.  The zoom is great - better than my friends camera which was supposedly the same range. Some scenery shots have a green tinge to them - I noticed this in Steve's digicam review and I haven't worked out how to sort it out yet.  But its only a very small minus.

The idea of little flash memory cards and a 10 month old in the same building gave me cold sweats. That said, the camera is fantastic. The pictures are sharp and clear, and the resolution is fantastic. The first real shot I took with it (my daughter covered in baby food) was so sharp, you could actually see the fine print on her baby outfit. I did have the same problem with the \"press the button and the image freezes, pauses, and then takes the picture of whatever it's pointing at then.\" But, after searching the manual, I discovered the answer. If you press the button half-way down, the little green light flashes, and then goes solid. From then on, squeezing the button the rest of the way takes an instant picture of what's being shown. I have some great shots of my son playing baseball with the bat and the ball caught in frame. Admittedly, that fact should have been printed in big bold letters on page two instead of fine print on page 47, but that's the fault of the tech-writers.So far, my only complaint is that pictures seem to be dark indoors, and the flash tends to overexpose rather than illuminate. Most of this can be avoided with the \"spot meter\" setting though, so I can't complain too much.Overall, I would recommend anyone who wants a serious camera to get this one.

It is a large digital camera but is comparable in size to the Nikon I'm still using now. The CD's are small enough to fit in your pocket and I can carry two CD's where as I'd have to carry 9 rolls of 35mm film 36 count. The anti-shake feature is very handy in that I'm not able to pick the times and conditions of my being out to take pictures. I wish the assesories where easier obtianed for the camera. I wish the tripod mount had a little more surface area for secure mounting. I also would like to see the flash attachment have a different mount screw/clamp. This one doesn't tighten up good enough and stay tight for camera manipulation in tight spots and odd angle takes.

First off, the cd media is the most convenient and best storage method around -- you can store more pictures at higher resolution for the most convenience.  And the Sony 3\" disk prices aren't that unreasonable (...).  Granted, it is a still camera only, if you're looking for plenty of video options, look elsewhere.  But for the camera enthusiast, the 15 seconds of video is a novelty item.The size may seem a bit bulky at first, but Sony has tailored the camera's ergonomics perfectly, no matter HOW you like to hold the camera.I shoot most pictures in 1600 x 1200 just so that I have the flexibility of blowing them up later and usually can fit anywhere from 130-150 pictures on each disk.My only complaints are that it doesn't perform well in very dark setting without an stronger flash added on and for the 'quick shooter' it may seem slow -- it takes about 5 seconds to write the image to the disk, so you can't shoot in rapid sucession.

I already have the Mavica fd-83 but wanted to upgrade. The fd-83 worked well but I had heard that the picture quality was even better on the CD1000 (which it definetly is) and as convenient as the floppy disks were to put in the computer they were kind of inconvenient to carry around. As a budding photographer I had to carry a lot around and change them frequently. The max I ever got on a floppy was 13, and that was using black and white, compared to a cd's 100+.Although the size is larger than most cameras I was surprised at how lightweight it is. And though it may look bulky it fits very comfortably in your hand. Overall, I am extremely pleased with this camera. The only complaint I have is minimal. Unlike, the fd-83 it doesn't have a button on the camera to change the picture type(b&w, sepia, etc.). You have to go in through the menu to change it. Only a slight inconvenience and only because I am used to having it right at my fingertips.P.S. You can take action shots with this camera. Like, all Sony Mavica's when you press down the button half way it auto-focuses and a green light comes on. Then you push down the rest of the way to take the picture. In cases where you're taking action shots you simply keep the button pushed down half-way in preparation for your shot. I really wouldn't call it a flaw. Its just something you have to get used to.

The primary  difference is one uses Diskettes (95) and the other uses mini CD's (CD1000).I usually take both and I have an extra battery. both use the same battery and are designed the same, except for the door and way you load the diskettes or CD's.The advantage of the CD1000 is that you can almost take an endless supply of pictures on one CD. Ok it does end but I've been able to get over 55 pictures on one CD.both the 95 and the 1000 operate about the same and look very similar. They are big and bulky, but take good >NO< great pictures.What do I not like about it? well, you have to format the CD in the machine and then perform a finish task  before being able to view in the computer. To finish involves going through three layers of menu on the camera. Its a tedious process for one spoiled by the FD95, where one just pulls out the diskette and puts it in the computer. People claim you can read the CD in the CD1000 without finishing the CD, but I found it impossible to do so. I did play with a disk by finishing and then re setting for pictures without losing a photo, which the camera Instructions did not say it could be done, but it can.WHichever one you buy, it will be used because they are no longer sold new.  You see people want small and neither is small.  But let me tell you, size does make a difference people are intimidated by a big camera. The bells and whistles on either are worth it!  I've had friends pull out their FD75 or their CD250 to take a picture, but when I whip out either, it intimidates those with the smaller cameras.I would say for novice with the old Windows 98 computer should get the FD95, but the pro with the big monster computer on Windows XP and photo printer should get the CD1000.With the prices listed now (both new stared in the $900.00 to $1000.00), there is no reason to get both!", "Date": "January 26, 2006"}, {"Title": "nice camera...awesome", "Author": "- Y - RANCH", "ReviewID": "R2ES6TOPV5X29N", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "the size is big, for me that was a great feature because it fits my hand, the weight of the camera is not a problem though.  I love the fact that the camera has a cd burner.  Less wires to hook up, just put the cd in your pc or laptop run the software and go.  It has it's own formats on the camera itself, many to choose from plus a delete if I happened to get a bad picture by accident. You get one chance otherwise it is burned for good.The advantage of the zoom for me is outdoor wildlife pictures (hunting type- big game, and all the wildlife and nature shots) and scenery.  It is awesome for this.  I did buy a flash for it so that I could get better pictures of my twins' basketball pictures, another advantage of that zoom as well.  Also, I bought a lens to keep out the dust when I am taking horse pictures in the corral,my little girl on her horse, or working cattle pictures by horses-I have carried this camera on my horse as well. The battery that I have lasts a long time, so that I can get a whole BB game on it,the stills and some in movie mode.  the advantage of getting the 15 second plus movie option (as well as still shot) is great for those free shots, jumpshots, running plays, etc.  One thing that I do not like about it is it is very slow.  So, I have learned to anticipate the picture that I want to capture when it is an action shot.  Still shots-well, then it is an advantage.  Just gives a person time to get things set for perfect shots.  I wish that it had a self timer for family pictures so that I can get in some of them, but that's all right, I will lose 25 pounds first-lol.  I have taken some family pictures for relatives.  The advantage of the mini disc is that it will burn up to 180 pictures+ and more. If the movie mode is used, well it takes up more space and you have to use more cds.  I might buy a 2x zoom and another battery the next purchase, we'll see.  Also, I bought my mini CDs on auction by the 100's so I don't have to worry about that aspect of reorders,etc.  So, I guess, if you buy this--enjoy shooting a lot of pictures because, I figure it is something like a penny or 2 pennies a picture.

The pictures are so sharp that they are breath-taking. I suspect this is due to the Zeiss lens. It is also easy to frame the subject in any light because it has a good view finder whereas many of the newer models rely solely on the LCD screen which is hard to use in bright sunlight or in low-light situations. The nicest feature is the ability to store photographs on the 3\" CD, which then comes out of the camera and goes directly into a standard CD drive on your PC. This mode of storage allows the photographer to take hundreds of shots while in the field without having to download a memory stick or memory card after 19 or 38 (depending upon the size of the memory card)to a PC. The small CDs are easily transported in the camera bag and make the camera a real winner in my book. I particularly like the the view finder over the LCD screen for ease of framing the subject and getting the best results. If this camera had had a slightly higher pixel rating, I would have given in five stars, but from the pictures my brother has sent to me and the ones I have seen printed in 8X10 framed pictures, I have been sold on this camera.

I wasn't sure I would like this particular camera because of the 2.1 megapixel technology.  It was the CD-R that enticed me to order one.  When  I opened the box and started using it I was pleasently surprised.The camera takes some very nice pictures at any resolution.  Tiff images @ 1600X1200 take a good 15+ seconds to write to the CD-R.  JPG pictures @ 1600X1200 take a little less than two seconds to write to the CD-R.  This camera is not designed to take bursting pictures or situations that require rapid succession of shots.  The flash works well in normal and red-eye reduction modes.  Macro shots do not do well with the flash.  The lens assembly prevents the flash from reaching a macro subject.The MPEG movie mode works quite well and just like any of the other Mavica series cameras.  The limitation is a maximum recording time of 15 seconds.  If you shot is longer than this you have to take multiple 15 second shots.The USB connection is really nice.  I can transfer pictures in seconds from the camera to the computer.  The supplied drivers allow the camera to become another drive letter on your computer when it is plugged in.  I am using WindowsME without any issue with this camera or software.  I little FYI note is included in the box informing the purchaser that USB drivers for Windows2000 are not included.  The note gives a URL to check for the Windows2000 driver.  As of this writing the driver is not on the web site.Initializing a new CD-R is fast and easy.  It takes about 20 seconds.  The included adaptec software will also let you format the CD-R in the camera from your PC with the USB cable attached.  The included software will also let you copy files from your PC to the CD-R on the camera.  Finalizing a CD-R when it is full is easy and straightforward.  After the CD is finalized it's contents can be viewed in any computer that has a CD.  3\" CD-R's are readily available from many sources and are priced very attractively.  Buy them in bulk and you are really saving a lot of money over single CD-R purchases.The image stabilization makes a noticeable differences in both the optical and zoom modes.
