It is lightweight, recognizes objects, smiles and faces in photos and takes brilliant photos despite the environment.  The first photo I took was of my husband standing right in front of a sunny patio door and it turned out perfect.  At first I was going to send it back because it takes 2 AA batteries and I would rather have a rechargable plug in camera.  But after taking such easy great pictures I've decided to keep it around for awhile!", "Date": "September 25, 2010"}, {"Title": "Great Camera!", "Author": "Meyer", "ReviewID": "R2MRQRCLUFOPVJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is a nice, cheap, easy to use camera, got it as a gift for my 12 year old niece and now Im her favorite uncle!", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B0036WMKNE"}}
