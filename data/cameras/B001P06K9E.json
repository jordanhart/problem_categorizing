{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Good Value", "Author": "Brin Mclaughlin", "ReviewID": "R24S6CDPIG78UF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera while on vacation. (My previous one died under mysterious circumstances and will be autopsied upon arriving home.) For now, while I am still away, I needed a basic camera that would use my existing Olympus camera accessories (xD cards, AA batteries, USB cable) and the FE-45 seems to fit the bill. At just a little over a hundred dollars, it's a nice bargain. The manual is a little less intuitive than I would have liked, but if you have already owned other Olympus digital cameras, then this won't be a surprise. Overall, so far, it's been a nice camera to use.", "Date": "July 9, 2009"}, {"Title": "Camera Didn't Work", "Author": "B. Stricker", "ReviewID": "R8RWF7A96BNCE", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I don't know if we received a refurbished camera (even though it was advertised as new) but this camera did not function from day one.  No matter how often we replaced the battery it said it was empty - the camera would turn off in the middle of taking a photo.  The couple of photos we did manage to take were horrible quality.  Not a good product.  On the upside - the seller was great about letting us return it for a full refund.  But buyer beware.", "Date": "May 10, 2010"}, {"Title": "lousy - disappointed with Olympus", "Author": "prudd802", "ReviewID": "R1OT6CDXN814RJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I have an Olympus and love it, bought this for my daughter.  It was awful.  She had to return it twice.  The pictures weren't good.  Finally she just trashed it and bought a different brand.
