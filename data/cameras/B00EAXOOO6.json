{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Nikonn D7100 with 18-300 VR Lens Package", "Author": "Ricky", "ReviewID": "R14D4OLRVK43OJ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Package ordered is exactly what I received and was received by the time as promised.  The package was a good package even though the Nikon Case is too small for the camera and 18-300 lens to fit inside without taking the lens off.  No place for the flash if you do that.  Battery pack is just that.  It is not the MB-D15 which they did not list it as such but I thought they were one of the same.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this order.  The camera and lens is a great combination! It is still rated as 5 Stars!", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$2,169.95", "Features": "KIT INCLUDES 12 PRODUCTS -- All BRAND NEW Items with all Manufacturer-supplied Accessories + Full USA Warranties:\n<1> Nikon D7100 Digital SLR Camera Body + <2> Nikon 18-300mm VR DX AF-S Lens + <3> Nikon Digital SLR Camera Case +\n<4> Transcend 64GB SDXC 10 Card + <5> Battery Grip for D7100 + <6> Spare EN-EL15 Battery +\n<7> PD 77mm (UV/CPL/ND8) Filters + <8> Precision Design ML-L3 Remote + <9> PD HDMI to Mini-HDMI Cable +\n<10> PD 6pc Complete Cleaning Kit + <11> PD Memory Card Storage Wallet + <12> LCD Screen Protectors", "Name": "Nikon D7100 Digital SLR Camera Body with 18-300mm VR Lens + 64GB Card + Case + Battery & Grip + HDMI Cable + Filter Set", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61y0oPz2y%2BL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B00EAXOOO6"}}
