{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Better Than Expected - A Great Value", "Author": "Technical Reader", "ReviewID": "R1EOI5ROAQ2MU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Bought this from Amazon as a little test camera before buying a better model, but was pleased enough with the quality and function to actually use it for real.I have this attached to an Axis M7001 Video Encoder to convert the analog signal from the camera into a digital version capable of being viewed over our LAN. The signal from the camera is strong, the picture clear and the quality very good.This was originally just going to be used to develop a sample of the system (encoder + web + camera) but it is now watching the front of my house full time. It is hanging outside under the eaves, unprotected, in winter weather. Over the last week it has dropped under 20 degrees with snow and a great deal of wind (the camera does not get rain or snow on it under the eaves). No problems. The Axis encoder (inside the house, of course) reports when a signal is lost and so far it has stayed up even in the bad weather.Light sensitivity is high and it switches to B/W mode about as well as any other model I have seen. It will deliver a picture when your eyes will not, but it is not a \"night vision\" device. Some ambient light is required (you should put up an IR light if you want to see in the dark).A few notes about the camera if you choose to buy it: - There is no power supply provided: this is normal with security cameras. You may have a 12 v. dc power adapter laying around that does 500 mA or more, but if not you can run down to the local Radio Shack and pick one up easily (or get one on Amazon). The adapter size is standard for security cams. If your adapter plug does not match...again - run down to Radio Shack and get one. Or better yet save the hassle and just get the one Amazon tells you to get. - There are no adjustments on this camera. None. The field of view you buy is what you get. - The video connector is a standard BNC type. This means it is not compatible with your home coax wire (screw-on terminal) unless you get a BNC/Coax adapter. - If you want to plug this directly into your TV, DVR or VCR: Look for some BNC/Coax and BNC-RCA adapters (search on Amazon, they are easy to find). Use the BNC/coax adapter on the camera to attach the camera to standard coax cable, then use a coax/RCA adapter on the other end to plug it into your TV on one of your alternate video inputs (don't use one with a channel tuner as this camera does not use 'channels'). Done. - To hook it into your computer (see over the web): you will need a video encoder to do this. These are invariably more expensive than the camera itself. The Axis brand products are pretty much the industry standard but you are looking at something in the $250-$270 per camera depending on which of their encoders you use. But they work great. There are a dozen other options you can figure out...but the stand-alone encoders work and do not require another computer - the web server is built it.We'll be adding more cameras soon and I will probably get more of this model. They offer great capability for the low price.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}, {"Title": "For price its ok", "Author": "Positronic", "ReviewID": "RY1SAH5HE1ROR", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I bought this as someone had been stealing stuff off our carport. The video image is not as clear as I'd like but for the price it's expected. I'm going to try out a camera in the $80-$90 range (560TVL) to see if I can get a camera with a more detailed image. Btw - I'm using this with the 4 Channel Embedded Linux US411L which costs about $130 on Amazon. It is a standalone DVR which allows 4 cameras up to 320x240 resolution at 30fps, or, 2 cameras at 740x480 at 15fps. The reviews were good which is why I bought it, and, this camera. You would also need a cable to carry power and video (and audio if wanted though you'd need a seperate mic). This is the cable I bought - VideoSecu 50 Feet Power Video Audio CCTV Security Camera Cable Wire with Free BNC RCA Adapter 1JC, and this is the power supply - VideoSecu 12V DC CCTV Security Camera Power Supply Adapter with 4 (2.1mm) Channel Connectors Port PW154 1I0, and this is the mic - VideoSecu High Sensitive Preamp Mini Microphone with Power Bypass for Security Audio Sound Voice Monitoring Recording and Free Warning Decal WD4. The DVR only has one mic input (though may be able to use a splitter).", "Date": "July 28, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good quality hidden camera, nice price!", "Author": "A. Psarianos", "ReviewID": "R3FGHV293DQTCQ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My husband and I bought lots of different cameras for our HIDDEN security setup and this one is the best hidden camera by far. We bought and returned several cameras, and this camera is the best for its size in all of our hidden cameras, for the fact it does not have those LEDs around the lens (at night when you look at a camera with LEDs you can see them glowing, not good if you want hidden cameras). If you have 8 or 16 LEDS around the lens, they might only throw a little light about 5-8 feet, but beyond that they are useless. However, a 100 led light camera is really easy to spot if you are trying to hide them. We did have a camera with 28 LEDs inside my department, but because of the light they put out, small bugs would be attracted to the light and set off the motion sensor constantly. I think companies put LED lights on cameras to sell them because they seem like a good idea. But in reality, I found them to be useless if you want to hide a camera or use a motion sensor.Pros:Tiny, about the size of a lipstickSturdy, aluminum construction could use in any environmentExcellent high res image with good colorPre focused lens from about 2 feet to infinityReasonably wide lensWork well with IR illuminatorCons:Nearly immune to the effects of high wind, blowing dust, and gale force rainIn service with full exposure to several rain storms, high winds, and temperatures ranging from - 20 degrees F to 122 degrees F with no problems.Color balance is very good, and the aperture control is excellent.Light sensitivity for a good picture is acceptable to deep dusk, and objects can be recognized beneath street lights.If you are looking camera you can to the point it's basically invisible. For high quality and around 50 dollars, this VideoSecu camera is the best one.", "Date": "October 12, 2010"}, {"Title": "Not Weather Proof & Not Weather Resistant", "Author": "Jack", "ReviewID": "RXH4DWHEXTOQY", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I bought this camera in black to upgrade a $25 camera I bought 6 months ago which works good, but the colors are off. At first, I was pretty impressed with this camera since it had a decent daytime picture & had a very good nighttime picture when facing my street. The street lights on my block provide enough light that this camera gave a night picture that was comparable to my other Infrared Night Vision Cameras. Also, even though it says it is \"Weather Proof\", I usually take that to mean \"Weather Resistant\", especially with cameras that are under $50, so I mount my outside cameras under eaves etc. to shield them from the elements.Unfortunately, less than 48 hours after installing this camera outside under the eave of my garage it has failed. When I reviewed playback of recordings from the first night, I noticed that it fogged up at dawn, then cleared itself up by noon. I took it down & inspected it, it seemed OK, so I assumed it fogged up outside the lens, not inside, so I put it back up. Today, on the 2nd day of use, I came home to see the live view was just fuzzy black & grey circles. I took the camera down again & you can see condensation has built up behind the lens.I really do not understand how this happened since it is not directly exposed & is somewhat shielded from the elements. It did not even rain, just a light drizzle followed by a heavy fog during the first morning. I have never bought an outside camera that has failed so fast.I also bought a 4 pack of camera cables from VideoSecu that were very thin & 3 of the 4 were no good right out of the box (see my other reviews). I notice all VideSecu products seem to have many good reviews here on Amazon, many more than most other security system products, but after my experiences with a few of their products, I suspect the reviews are mostly fake. I would advise people to stay away from VideoSecu products here on Amazon.", "Date": "February 20, 2013"}, {"Title": "Just OK and no more.", "Author": "MO", "ReviewID": "R2XWXESN9TJZ9P", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "The electronics and resolution are OK.

You cannot see anything at night at all and they have a lot of static at night as well, very grainy picture. They do not have any option to adjust the picture or the settings! The daytime picture is ok but they do not have a very wide view angle. They are not as attractive as they appear in the photo. In the photo they appear to be all white. The cameras that they sent me have a very cheaply made and looking silver stand as opposed to white and the cameras are beige. Therefore they are not as discrete as advertised because of the coloring. They are also very heavy. I am afraid that the stands will not sustain the weight of the camera after time.If you are looking for a basic camera to view only a small area during the day and or only in bright light then these cameras will work fine for you.
