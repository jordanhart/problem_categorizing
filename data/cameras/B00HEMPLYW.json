This package really exceeded my expectations with coming with 3 batteries, a 64 gig class 10 sd card plus an extra adaptable car charger ect....at the moment this is the best deal I came across over months of searching. THIS BEATS ADORAMAS PRICES. Adorama's current price on a USED nikon coolpix a is $850 let alone its retail price of $1,096 without extra batteries, memory card, camera case, cleaning kits ect. THIS PACKAGE FROM EBasket IS AN EXCELLENT KIT FOR SERIOUS/PROFESSIONAL PHOTOGRAPHERS & FIRST TIME PHOTOGRAPHERS LOOKING FOR A BARGEN. I would recommend this kit for serious/professional for the convince of the included extra batteries & a high grade memory card, & for BEGINNING PHOTOGRAPHERS looking to get into photography this is THE KIT TO HAVE; it comes with everything you would need to get started.", "Date": "March 5, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00HEMPLYW"}}
