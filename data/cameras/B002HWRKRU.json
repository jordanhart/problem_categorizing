And it's came in handy for other situations too.  With the updated technology, this is probably not for the real professional, but for the one who needs easy pictures to be taken and for more generic items; this will do the job.  There is not a lot of storage on the disc either...13 pictures at a time.  But I like it for what I need it for.", "Date": "November 18, 2009"}, {"Title": "No audio", "Author": "Joseph L.

I got the camera because of its high resolution, and never thought twice to ensure it actually had audio. One would think a camera that shot video would have audio. Right? Wrong. I guess when they made this, they decided to ad video capture without thinking about the fact that there is no microphone.I sent it back.", "Date": "January 18, 2010"}, {"Title": "Grandaughter's delight", "Author": "Jo Ann Masterjohn", "ReviewID": "RNQW490RYCSC7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "My Grandaughter just loves her camera. Pink, being her color, was a big hit in itself. The fact that it was small and easy to take pictures, gave her reason to sneek it to school and get pictures of all her friends. She's learning the ease of it needs to have it's place though. It's a good purchase.

It does have a cable to connect to the computer however.", "Date": "May 4, 2010"}, {"Title": "Poor choice!", "Author": "Nadav S.

Sager", "ReviewID": "R29ML6GWAFVF5S", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I would love to be able to review this camera, but I can't as it has yet to arrive.  It was to be a Christmas present for my daughter.Granted, I did order the camera late (Dec 20), but I did pay extra shipping so that it would arrive by 12/24/09.  But the camera never arrived.In checking the tracking of the item, UPS did not pickup the item until 12/21.  Everything else I ordered the same day was in the hands of the shipper (UPS/FedEx/USPS) on 12/20.Worse, I have been tracking this package daily.  First UPS posted that it arrived in Secaucus NJ (from California) on 12/24.  Too late to arrive by Christmas, but at least would have it on Monday - right?On Monday, 12/28/09, I checked again, but this time the UPS tracking indicated that the package arrived in Secaucus at 9:41 AM.  Ok, perhaps it would arrive late in the afternoon, or at worst, Teusday morning.I just checked the status again today (12/29) as the package hasn't arrived.  Now according to UPS, the package arrived in Seacaus at 3:20 pm on 12/29/09!!!WTF????  Why does the \"ARRIVAL DATE\" keep changing?  First the 24th, then the 28th, and now the 29th.  How is that possible?  Sure looks like someone is falsifying information.Secondly, if you PAY EXTRA to have the package shipped by 12/24 - why the hell does it take 8 days to go from California to NJ???What did UPS do, send it on one of their little brown delivery trucks - that kept delivering packages for 3,000 miles?  No way it should take 8 days for anything to get from Ca to NJ via UPS.Interesting to note, today's vendor (7th Avenue Electronics) is not the same vendor as when I ordered the camera.  Guess I should have waited, as the camera is cheaper today than it was on the 12/20 \"Gold Box\" special.", "Date": "December 29, 2009"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$89.99", "Features": "12-megapixel resolution for photo-quality prints up to 20 x 30 inches\n3x optical zoom; 2.5-inch LCD\nCapture images to xD-Picture Card or microSD (not included)", "Name": "Olympus FE-26 12MP Digital Camera with 3x Optical Zoom and 2.7 inch LCD (Pink)", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41JJHmJQxHL._SX300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B002HWRKRU"}}
