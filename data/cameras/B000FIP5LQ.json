It works when hardwired.  I have had several emails from Ly Seang, the company trouble shooter.  His replies are short, not specifically responsive to my clearly stated issues AND his replies have not helped.  I have learned that this product cannot be managed except on some XP machines and it cannot be viewed except by Internet Explorer on some machines set up with restrictions.  Therefore it is NOT a true IP Camera.  I would have given it NO STARS if that had been an option.", "Date": "October 23, 2008"}, {"Title": "Good quality video", "Author": "J. Reviewer \"Mr. Jay\"", "ReviewID": "R33BR8G2GUA272", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have 3 of these cameras (first one over 3 years old, and still working) I use these around the house (wired). I not have tested the wireless feature. I have used xp32, xp64, vista, and windows 7 x64 over the last 3 years and all os'es have worked with the cameras. I initially use the installation program on a machine to configure the cameras (I assign a static IP so I can find them with my browser. But mostly I use the included IP Cam Secure software to monitor all 3 at one time from one interface. This seems to work fairly well. They also have a microphone for picking up sound (no speaker in camera, so you can only hear what is going on). Picture quality is good in rooms with daylight. Not for dark areas. I can highly recommend this camera.", "Date": "December 15, 2010"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B000FIP5LQ"}}
