{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Totally satisfied!", "Author": "PEDRO", "ReviewID": "R1QL3JJXLZH0Q9", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "We bought this camera as our first DSRL camera. I have always had compact cameras and have to say the improvement on my pictures is just AWESOME. The camera is really small and light comparing with the others on the market. It feels really well made. All the accesories are totally usefull and with a good quality.  The telehoto lens is exactly what I wanted, but all the other items makes this bundle just perfect.  I'm trying to use all the manual/semimanual modes of the camera but have to say I found the mode \"Shooting Night scenes handheld\" TOTALLY useful. I shot some pictures at night this Christmas using this mode ant the results are much better than I ever expected.I absolutely recomend to buy this bundle from Cameta Camera. Their prices are incredible and their customer service is the best I've ever seen online.", "Date": "January 28, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good enough for this old bot.", "Author": "Thomas R.

SO glad I did. I am still trying to remember and learn all the different settings but that is what i wanted. I used to always use a 35mm slr camera until the digital ones came out. Had not been able to afford a digital slr until now. And combine the amazing deal Cameta Camera has with amazon for the package deal of all the accessories with the amazon payment plan made it just too hard to pass up.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "great buy!", "Author": "Samuel Foster", "ReviewID": "R23W0WL7XDSW1H", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Great price and shipping was fast. Everything was brand new in factory box.

After the box arrived, i was pleasently surprised on how neatly is was packaged and how professional the information was relayed.  The Camera itself is a fine piece of craftsman ship,  a little smaller for my hands, but great for the wifes, who is the dominate user.  It was easy to set up and learn the basics on how to capture images for a novice.  There are a lot of features on the camera that she has recently started working with that will allow even more functionality!  The only bad thing about this paticular package / combo was i wish it would have had a SL1 for dummies manual or a little bit more instruction on the filters, lenses and lighting.  Also, the Wireless remote is nice, but i would have swapped it out for the cabled shutter control.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B00CIBRAKM"}}
