They were the lowest price, were in the same state as me, and advertised on Amazon that they only had 2 left. To me that means I should see this in about a week. Spent thousands on Amazon and it never took longer than 1 week for me to get anything. Well 3 weeks later I contacted the seller through Amazon and the next day the response was \"the item you ordered shipped direct from the manufacture, it should arrive in 3 to 5 business days\".  I responded asking for tracking info and if they were unable to provide me with that information to cancel my order I will go somewhere else. The next business day the response was \"this item shipped 10 days ago\", no tracking information was provided. I wrote back \"impossible, provide me with tracking or cancel my order\". I never heard back from them. I filed a claim with Amazon who refunded my money and the following day my system arrived. I did contact Amazon and gave the money back. So Beach Camera was terrible, will never order anything from them again ever.So the system claims it works for mobile devices specifically says works with IPhone and Blackberry.  Well that's a lie. I got the system up and running and downloaded the IPhone app. The app had 1 star and all terrible reviews, no one who left a review was able to get it to work. I gave it a shot and it doesn't even kind of work. It loads, says it buffering and then exits out of the app on to the home screen.  Would return it except I had it professionally installed and would have more money in labor then the thing is worth. The cameras ore ok, its full color during the day and black and white at night, the IR picks up just about everything. The resolution is not great, I have the video on a 42\" HD set and you can't really see faces that well. If you did catch someone doing something on 1 of these systems figuring out who the person is or getting a good shot is probably not possible. For the $400 price bracket for a  4 cam system I guess its ok but def not as good as advertised.", "Date": "June 23, 2011"}, {"Title": "great system", "Author": "Sports Rican", "ReviewID": "R187CWO62P486W", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This system is good for your simple monitoring use and for the price. The material used on the casing does not adjust well and can not be over tighten or it will break . Camera system only zooms in not out so if you need it for a small enclosed area this is not the right camera to get. If its used to view something that is 25ft or more this system is excelent. I am happy with this system but it would have been better if you can zoom out.Quick delivery and the online support is excelent.", "Date": "January 9, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$674.99", "Features": "Access live video footage directly from an iPhone or BlackBerry Smart Phone\nH.264 video compression records over a month of footage\nCoaching iMenu guides users through DVR settings & features\nMultiple viewing options connects up to 2 TVs & a VGA monitor\n24/7 lifetime live customer support is available through phone, email & live web chat", "Name": "SVAT CV502-4CH-001 4 Channel Smart Phone Compatible H.264 DVR Security System with Coaching iMenu and 4 Indoor/Outdoor Night Vision Surveillance Cameras", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41t61T6u9oL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004CMDGY4"}}
