The original digital Elph was the S100 (I still have that one), and quite a few Sxxx models have been issued between the time that one came out and now.This one gets the SD designation to denote its use of a Secure Data memory card, which is a very small card with a tiny lever that prevents the card's data from being accidently erased or overwritten. Frankly, I think it's much ado about nothing; I've never had a problem erasing my files by accident and I resent the fact that I needed a new card reader to accommodate this slight alteration. Of note, however, almost all SD cams will accept MultiMediaCards (MMCs) happily.Anyway, in true Canon style, the optics here are good and the body is well constructed and attractive. The controls are fairly intuitive and (proprietary) battery use is above average.The resolution is a more than adequate 3.2 megapixels.The Achilles Heel of the SD100 however is the far too short (2X) optical zoom, the same power found on the original S100 nearly 5 years ago. You are much less likely to find a use for 3.2 megapixels (versus 2 megapixels) than you would be to find many photo opps where you'd wish you had a more competent zoom.All things considered, in this price range and assuming compactness appeals to the Elph buyer, I'd say the Pentax Optio and the Minolta Dimage are both better cameras than the Canon SD100.", "Date": "November 16, 2003"}, {"Title": "Great Camera for the non-professional", "Author": "J.

CompactFlash is much thicker and larger than the Secure Digital card used in the SD100 (this model).  It's cheaper per-megabyte, but is slower and draws more power.  Canon is doing a good thing by using the increasingly dominant SD format in this dimunitive digital camera.Function-wise this camera is a good point-and-shoot replacement.  You won't find many manual controls (beyond the usual exposure comp, white balance, flash control, and a few other common controls), but it's a good \"pick up and snap away\" camera.  2X optical zoom is rather inadequate for any semi-serious photographers who travel a lot, but ok if you just carry this to events and parties.Picture quality is much better than my first-generation S100 digital elph camera from a couple years ago.  I still find the exposure a bit on the underside and the color tone a bit on the cold side.  If you want top-notch picture quality, consider the 4-MP Canon S400 which has excellent image quality and color balance.In summary, this is a very capable digital camera in a great form factor.  It's light and easy to carry, and does a fine job as long as you don't do serious photogrpahy with it.", "Date": "March 12, 2004"}, {"Title": "An amazing all-round camera with one glaring flaw", "Author": "Kray", "ReviewID": "R1ZRG6BUSNHCMI", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "After a long research, I decided to purchase the Canon IXUS II (or SD100 in some countries) as my first digital camera. As a background, I am generally a point-and-shoot person with aspirations to take up photograpgy as a more serious hobby. I've been using it extensively for about two months now, and here's what I think are the good and bad points of the camera:GOOD POINTS1. Amazing picture quality for OUTDOOR shots - Pictures are sharp and crystal clear. The photos produced are exactly like what I saw with my own eyes.2. Small, slim and solid - Can fit in my pocket easily. Now I can take it everywhere and ready to take a snapshot whenever I feel like it. It opens a whole new possibilities.3. Relatively easy to use - The buttons layout are spot on, everything important is within reach of your thumb or index finger. On-screen menus are logical and easy to use. For advance features, I still need to read the manual though.4. Movie quality is generally good. All movies I took plays well (with good sound) on the camera's LCD and and also on my 29\" TV. The sound playback on the camera is quite loud and can be heard even in noisy areas.5. Fast operation - fast starting up time and time between shots, you wont notice any delays. Transferring images to PC is also relatively fast.6. Battery life is okay, I managed to took 68 shots (plus a hell lot of picture playback on LCD and on TV) before the battery died.7. Great LCD display. Sharp images and good colour reproduction. Can be seen easily in bright sunlight.BAD POINTS1. Average (on the borderline of poor) INDOOR picture quality. Every photo I took that uses the flash turns out ugly. The photos have this unnatural yellow glow (from the flash) on the subject, and the background becomes very dark, even though the room was evenly lit in real life. The best that I could do is to use Manual, and set the Exposure to -1 2/3, White Balance to Tungsten, and set the Effects to Neutral, and ISO to 50. That manages to turn my indoor pictures from ugly to bearable. The other alternative is to take indoor shots with flash off, as suprisingly it produces good pictures. But you need to use a tripod to get sharp images, which isn't always convenient. I'm really dissapointed with the indoor performance of this camera. None of the glowing reviews I read in my research highlighted this problem. 2. Low battery indicator only shown on screen when the battery is on the verge of dying. If you don't have a spare battery and you are outside, your camera would be useless until you get back and recharge the battery.3. Need to take out the battery to recharge.4. Only 2x optical zoom.5. Movies has a limit of 30 seconds per clip. You can fill up the whole memory card with movies, but it has to be in a series of 30s clips. You can't take one long continous movie shot.6. Once you downloaded your movie shots to PC, and you deleted the movie from your camera, you cant upload the movie back to your camera. You can upload still images back to your camera, but not movies.7. The bundled Canon software is not the best, nor is it the easiest to use.Conclusion: A great all round compact camera that is easy to use, and takes excellent outdoor shots. If you can live with average indoor shots, then buy this. Otherwise, I would recommend Sony Cybershot as it can take much much better indoor shots compared to this camera.

This camera has been totally abused, Its been dropped almost 10 times, somtimes from about 6 feet landing on tile and concrete surfaces. Ive spilled beer all over it 3 times so its been soaking wet and all i do is dry it off and its fine. It been in the rain, the snow, the heat, the humidity, and below zero tempertures. The lense has 3 dents in it, one from a metal cup being thrown at it by an angry photo subject where the lense was smashed in about 1/4 of an inch on an angle, and all i did (the next morning while sober) was just click out the lense and it worked FINE hahah. A few of my friends have digital cameras that broke just from them bumping into a table with the camera in their pocket. This little Canon can take anything and I recommend it to ANYONE who brings their camera with them wherever they go. Its small and compact, sturdy, takes excellant photos (excepcially of hot chicks) in all conditions, great options, fun options like sounds and custome start up images, easy to use menu, and fits well in my hand.

I will go down on the pro's and con's.Pro's:1.  Very small.  It is with ease that you can put this camera into your pocket, or even into your glove dept of your car (and just how many things can you put in a glove dept these days?!!)  And the size really makes it easy for handling when taking pictures.2.  The digital rear view is very nice.  You get a clear vivid view of what it is that you are taking a picture of.  This is a fantastic feature, considering that many other camera's do not have a good view in the rear view... which sort of really goes against having the picture view in the rear of the camera in the first place!  Bright and easy to see.3.  For a 3.2 mpixel camrea, these pictures are pretty good quality.  I really like them, but would consider this a lower end camera... don't try to take shots of stuff far away.  This camera is for use close up.. like under 5 feet in distance for any definition.4.  Easy to use downloading from camera.  You can use the software they give you with this camera... or just skip it and use the windows XP software that automatically detects the camera, and loads the windows software that will work with your camera.  This is really nice that Canon and Bill Gates talked to each other and they shared information on drivers and software.  This does NOT alaways happen BTW.  Kudo's for Canon.Con's:1.  Battery life.  The battery is horrendous.  After six months, the battery rarely last over 15 - 20 minutes.  This is pretty bad.  I mean, this battery is easily the poorest quality of any battery in any device I have ever used.  And Canon should be ashamed for issuing the darn battery with this type of quality.  With Canon, you expect better quality.2.  Starter Camera.  This camera is really not for use for anything other than really close pictures.  Which is sorta what I said in the Pro section, and it is a pro for that reason.. but with the small zoom, I expected to get more than five feet or so for definition... perhaps I was over optimistic...3.  Outershell of camera.  After a couple of months, the color of the case of the camera sorta rubbed off.  It looks very dull, and old... I have had other cameras that are considerably older than this camera, but look a heck of a lot newer than this camera.  What did they put on the outer shell of this camera?  I do not know, but Canon should not use whatever it was again.  My camera looks like it is 50 years old.Overall:  A very good starter camera.  I would not get this again, but I would get it for someone who is just taking fun photos.  Perhaps get it for a youngster, or someone who might not really care that they can't get super good pictures.Have fun!!", "Date": "March 25, 2006"}, {"Title": "Awesome value (defined good quality, style and price)", "Author": "J.

First the size is not as small as the Pentax Optio S but it was small enough to fit in my pocket no problem. Default settings out of the box with 16MB SD card allowed me 19 clear shots in a room that only had my TV and one 25 watt flourescent light on (no adjustments whatsoever) or 16 shots and a short 20 sec video. SO GET A BIGGER SD card (I got an OEM 128MB sd card which works fine and cheaper than Canon's branded one)! Manual is easy to understand and controls are easy to manipulate, well spaced and LCD display is crisp. I was first considering the A70 since I wanted a good 3 MP below $300 but found the A70 too heavy and bulky to fit in my pocket. The 2x zoom is not great but I figure to be using this mostly for indoor shots that I can move closer to anyway. And from all the test shots I have done objects about 20-30 feet away still very clear and crisp even when zooming in from a distance and then zooming into the object itself. So far though it does what I want it to do, is small, has a solid feel and great pictures! The movie resolution in default is also fluid and clear and sound is clean too.

I didn't want any more embarassing comments from people like a \"Is that a camera in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?\"  This guy slips into the pocket with ease and is not bulky at all.  The camera was a little heavier than I expected, but thats no big deal.Picture quality has been good thus far.  Not great, but I didnt want to drop another hundy for just 1 MP improvement.  I bought a 512 MB SD card off Amazon for $75 (after rebate), so I don't have any problem fitting pictures on here.  Just splerge a little and you'll never have to worry about filling up the card.  I also bought a genuine Canon battery off of Ebay for a backup, but havent found battery power to be a problem as of yet.  The zoom does the trick for what I need.  If you are just taking pictures of friends, random hot chicks, etc this is fine.  Yeah, 3x optical would be nice, but this will suffice.  I really didn't intend to rhyme there, sorry.Here is my story on the durability of the camera.  So, my first outing with the camera.  A baseball game between two big crosstown rivals.  Tailgating in the lot before the game, pretty intoxicated.  Took a bunch of pictures already, turned out great.  Then the incident occurred.  Someone is standing a good 200 feet away throwing a softball back and forth with another guy I am with.  Random people are walking by left and right and an errant throw approaches my group.  I attempt to protect some bystanders from taking a head shot with the ball.  I throw my hand up in the air to block the ball, however, my blurred judgement threw up the hand with the camera in it.  Next thing I know, my new camera is airborne.  It flies about 8 feet high and 10 feet away from me, crashing into the side of a truck and then hitting the concrete full force.  It was like taking the camera and just whipping it against the ground.  I thought, \"well, it was nice having a digital camera for a few days.  This one is gone\"  Upon picking up the camera, I was pleasantly surprised.  The battery holder on the bottom fell off and the battery went flying.  After 3 minutes of searching under cars, the battery was found.  I popped it back in, snapped the cover back on, and the moment of truth came.  I hit the power button, and boom, it turns on like nothing ever happened.  All my old pictures are still there and I took many pictures the rest of the day.  All turned out great.  Two scrapes on the bottom is all of the lasting damage.  Gives my camera a little personality.  Matches the scrapes on my cell phone from similar instances.  So, this camera is definitely durable, will be able to take a few shots.  Also, if you drink too much and become a little clumsy with your possesions, this is the right camera for you.Overall, a great camera, defintely worth the price for me ($209).  I bought a somewhat cheaper one knowing that I might do something stupid and lose it or break it quickly.  That did occur, and it still works, so a plus for me.  Takes good pictures and is very easy to use and take around with you.  Overall, this is a great camera for the amateur photographer, who likes to travel but not be bogged down with a huge camera.  Take pictures of your friends and family and you will be happy.

I bought the SD100 based on my experience with the APS elph II.  It too is small, easy to use, and takes great pictures.  We love vacationing at theme parks and have found that it's easier to get around without having camera bags, backpacks etc... getting in the way.  I carry the SD100 on my belt with the optional leather case and hardly know it's there.  I use it at work too, and it's small enough to keep with me all the time.

Connection to a computer is simple with the included USB cable, and with my Windows XP machine I didn't even bother installing the software.  Just plug it in, turn it on, download your pictures.  I'm also a big fan of the stainless steel shell.Two drawbacks are the limited optical zoom and the size of the screen.  The screen is great for composing photos even in bright sun, but viewing them directly from the camera is much better when you connect to a TV with the included cable.  The optical zoom is what it is, but to get something longer you'll most likely need a larger camera.  I'm also glad I bought an extra, larger SD disk.

After much research, I found the Canon SD100.  Now there is a model above it but you pay $100 dollars more.  I wanted a camera that would be able to take decent photos of the wilderness that I was exploring and be VERY portable.  There are some things I found out and you can explore as well:The manual features are memorized.  I had some trouble with the Olympus resetting every time I shut it off.  The Canon takes all photos in max resolution minimum compression.  The ISO settings are not true.  As stated in another review, they seem to be one step up.  Therefore, ISO 50 is actually ISO 100 and so forth.  True view photos are seen thru the rear window.  Although I don't like to see the photos I am about to take thru the digital window in the back (battery conservation) I have found that what you see is what you get when you use the window in the back.  It has been taking some getting use to.Hope this helps you out.  I am happy with the SD100 and I will soon be posting many pictures on my website.

A sub-compact that seems to have been chiseled from solid steel, this will be a second digital camera to complement a more sophisticated (but larger) Olympus. Measuring only 3.3x2.2x0.9 inches this really does fit into a pocket.The Canon is a true 3.2 megapixel camera with 2x optical zoom. Pictures can only be recorded in JPG format with the standard  sizes and compression you'd expect on a camera this size. The omission of a RAW or TIF seems an oversight but this is a 'point and shoot'after all.The camera has an automatic and manual mode. Automatic gives the photograher no control over the camera other than flash, image resolution and macro. Switching over to manual extends the control to exposure compensation (+/-2 in 1/3 stop intervals), white balance, ISO rating and digital effects (sepia, B&W, Vivid, Low Sharpening and Normal). In addition Manual mode lets you focus the camera to infinity for landscape shots.Start-up and shut down times are very respectable and switching over to image review seems near instant.The LCD panel on the rear of the camera is bright and clear, it also seems to match about 100% of the actual image recorded. The viewfinder has a center mark but is really too small to use practically. If the battery was low on juice, turning off the LCD would save power but shooting would be fiddly.As well as images, the little SD100 can record short movies with sound in Quicktime format and you can add voice memos to shots. Recording sound memos takes a series of menu button presses to record the sound bite and an equal number of thumb presses to play it again - more of novelty than practical use.The camera 'mounts' to the PC with the supplied USB cable and supplied Twain driver and software. The software doesn't seem as intuitive as it could be. I'd like to just see the camera as a drive under Windows and drag and drop the files I want. The supplied software allows you to review thumbnails on the camera but view 'full size' requires a download to the PC. A secondary SD card reader might be a future accessory.Included with the software package are photo/video editing packages from Arcsoft as well as applications to create photo albums for printing.No software included for creating on-line photo albums though - seems Canon only offer this for European customers! Lack of battery indicator is the only other gripe, but since the camera is on its first charge and has now taken over 50 shots with/without flash, I see no reason to doubt the manufacturers claim of upto 180 images with LCD monititor turned on.The Canon S100 series case, a snip for under $10, is nice touch to a well finished quality feel camera.The newer SD110 is basically the same camera with a direct to print button and 32MB SD card.

I have lost many precious photos because the camera would suddenly stop me from reading the previous photos on camera due to \"Corrupt Data\".  When that happens, I can not re-format my SD memory card.  I have to borrow another SD digital camera to re-format my SD memory card before I can use the SD memory card again.  The camera flash is also too strong when the target person or object is within 4 feet of the camera.  Too bad the auto flash does not correct itself with the distance of the target object. Another drawback with this camera is the battery pack.  I have to take out the battery pack out of the camera every time I want to charge it, which is every other day.  I would much prefer just stick a cord/charger into the camera and charge the battery pack indirectly that way.  This would reduce the wear and tear of the battery/memory card door.

For example, if you first started your recording in an indoor environment such as your room and then proceed to record the view of outside your window(bright sunny day), the camera would not be able to cope with the bright light as it has been set for the light exposure of the room.

Well to my utter despair I was served no such warning and have lost a few memorable pictures. I was told that a friend had similar issues with an earlier version. I am surprised that Cannon has not corrected this on this newer version.", "Date": "October 30, 2003"}, {"Title": "I won't buy this camera again...", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R24KPMHYPF72LC", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I owened this camera for over six months now and I must say the picture quality is not all that.I owened previously, the S110 and that camera rocks.The SD100 night pictures have these glare circles on the pictures.You could take a nice picture and have this ugly circle  your face or somewhere in the frame.I don't know the cause,I called canon they said to use manual setting,but then why should I have to? the S110 never needed it...I exchanged the camera for another one thinking it's a manufacturer's defect, same thing.

I had done a fair amount of research into the choice of camera, and so knew pretty much what I wanted. When I saw it advertised I had a look at it and after I had had it demonstrated to me and I had handled it myself. I bought it. Once I was back in South Africa I realised that although all the blurb on the box was in English, and even though I had spoken English to the dealer, all the Handbooks and Manuals are in Dutch! I can manage the basic use as it is a very simple to manage camera, but for the downloading etc etc I would like to have more information and help available.
