I shoot exclusively in RAW format and this camera delivers excellent results. I've had several previous cameras of this same model. The latest one developed a lens problem as well as a problem with the internal battery that saves settings info. So I ordered this as a replacement. It was advertised as \"like new\" and I would have to agree that the description was accurate. All in all I am very happy with this purchase.", "Date": "May 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "A great deal in 2011", "Author": "anonreviewer", "ReviewID": "R64TMPTMB1WI5", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Still produces good to great images 7 years after introduction! Has some problems, like the mode dial that switches modes too easily in your pocket, has a 12mp mode that isn't really 12mp, and a 6mp mode that's a bit over-sharpened and overly compressed BUT nevertheless produces nice crisp, generally well-exposed images right out of the box. Doesn't over-expose as much as the F20 or F30 in my experience either. The 12mp Fine mode also produces an alternative to the more compressed and slightly over-sharpened 6mp mode but is a little noisier and softer. That can be corrected by downsizing the 12mp images to 6mp. Images are fairly noise-free for a compact camera, and even the ISO 800 setting, though not up to the quality of the F10 or F30, is pretty good, although only 3mp.This is all being picky as the 6mp images directly out of the camera are nicely \"punchy\", sharp, and have great colors, but in some situations having the 12mp Fine mode (or possibly the RAW mode, I have yet to try it) makes for better post-processing possibilities. There are some other minor oversights that the E900 corrected, like a live histogram and blinking highlights in playback mode that are lacking in the E550, but this camera is also faster in most respects than the E900 and is less expensive on the used market. Another accessory that I haven't tried yet is a lens converter; you can still get wide angle and tele add-on lenses for the E550 and the E510 on Amazon and eBay, and that may be true for the E900 model as well. Has all the manual modes you may want (wish it had a Custom setting mode too though!), shoots at over 3fps in burst mode, has manual focus if you need it (that could be easier to use though), and a flash you DON'T have to keep turning OFF, because it's a pop-up. All in all, still an exceptionally good value even after 7 years!", "Date": "June 27, 2011"}, {"Title": "After all these years, it still takes great pictures!", "Author": "aznpoet", "ReviewID": "R26KK6TS4GJQAZ", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera when it first came out in 2004.  I've had a number of Fuji as well as other digital cameras, both P &S; and DSLRs and had taken close to 1,000 images from this unit alone.  I've had a problem only one time, when I accidentally bumped the lens while it was open. It got jammed and the lens wouldn't retract.  I gently tugged on the lens and got it to shut it down.  I turned it back on and it worked OK without any problems since then.  Why a review now?  Well, I've used many number of digital cameras since 2002 and in hindsight, there were many cameras that I regretted purchasing, but this unit is not one of them despite what others had to say.  Some of my most memorable pictures were taken with E550 and if you understand the limitations, it takes fantastic pictures.PRO: It has a large sensor (1/1.7) for a compact camera - it matters if you are planning on blowing up the pic larger than 8x10.  It has full manual controls and useful 12 megapixel interpolated setting.  It has a sharp lens. It takes AA batteries (this maybe con to some).  Fast turn on and fast shutter - ready to shoot 1 second after you turn it on. Pretty impressive for a P&S;, in 2004!  It has a classic good looks of a retro rengefinder with optical viewfinder - useful when taking pictures on a bright day.CON: To get good pics indoors, you have to hold the camera very steady.ISO setting over 200 is useless.  To improve the indoor pictures, I use a small bracket and a slave flash in a bounce mode - this set up will improve any P&S;'s indoor pictures 1000 fold better.  Try it.  As for the battery, unless you use a fresh AA alkalines, it sometimes won't take as many pictures.  It is fickle with used half discharged AA alkalines.  At first, I thought the camera was broken but when I used different batteries, it worked fine.  I hate fiddling with most NiMH rechargeables as they tend to lose charge too quickly in storage. Sanyo brand Eneloop technology NiMH are only ones I would recommend as far as rechargeables go. It can be expensive but I now use disposable lithium batteries.  Since it is not my primary camera, with lithium batteries, it is ready to use without having to worry about dead batteries as lithium batteries have incredible shelf life.  Flash recharges somewhat slowly but no worse than other P&Ss.;  Shape is slightly bulky.  Too big for a pocket but not for a purse or a book bag.I paid $330 when it first came out. If you can get one on the cheap, say under $80, then it still merits consideration.  Sellers on Amazon have them priced too high.  Try eBay.  I think it takes better picture than many current P&S; around $100-$150.", "Date": "May 4, 2011"}, {"Title": "Takes Excellent Pictures but BREAKS!", "Author": "E. Campisi \"extrabooksalbany\"", "ReviewID": "R638AED9DX4FB", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have now had this camera for 2 years. The quality of the photos is usually excellent, and you can set the ISO to 800 and take pics without the flash in dark places. Or so I thought until the other night when several vital pictures I really needed for a blog came out with lines across them. I went to Steve's Forums and sure enough, this is a common problem with the processor on this camera, even though apparently Fuji will deny this 'till its dying day. I've also started having some problems with the telescoping lens and fussiness with the on/off switch.You'll be really happy for a while with this camera, but then it will break.I expect any camera to last for more than 2 years. I will certainly NOT make my next camera a Fuji.", "Date": "November 17, 2007"}, {"Title": "Bought a \"recertified\" E550 - Stopped Working Within Hours", "Author": "F. Verdi \"The Philadelphia Kid\"", "ReviewID": "R1MXG0992SKGOJ", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I was very excited when I received this camera. I liked it very much, and thought I was getting a lot of camera for the money. Sure enough, the pictures looked great, very true color, nice to handle, Black & White setting. It was a little heavy and uses those XD cards, but overall I really liked it. Then, within about three hours of owning it - after less then ten pictures - something had gone awry. The zoom lens was stuck, it wouldn't move and the \"zoom error\" message kept appearing. Then, the camera would shut off. That's when I referenced the manual and found out that it wasn't a fixable error. It had to be fixed by the manufacturer. I have since learned that there may be a fix for it, and quite frankly I wouldn't want to deal with the \"zoom error\" happening all the time anyway. I guess I know why I couldn't find a new one on-line, and why there were so many refurbished. I still really like Fuji cameras, but I wouldn't trust this model, especially a \"recertified\" one. I have since learned that I am not the only person who has found this out the hard way.
