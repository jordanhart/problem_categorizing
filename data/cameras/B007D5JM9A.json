I remember it well from the early 2000's.  This was back when the digital camera just started taking off and it was great to actually see the picture you just took without having to wait for the film to get developed.  This particular camera I bought has some issues that were not disclosed at the time of sale.  The battery door doesn't stay fully shut.  This is due to age and the locking tab being worn from use.  The camera works great, but I just bought it to add to my collection as the first digital camera I owned.", "Date": "October 31, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": null, "Features": null, "Name": null, "ImgURL": null, "ProductID": "B007D5JM9A"}}
