{"Reviews": [{"Title": "It does the job...", "Author": "spotlightlover \"spotlightlover\"", "ReviewID": "RNLMYOGZ8LSS7", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I needed to replace my aging Kodak V570 23mm wide-angle camera.  This Kodak was one of three I purchased in 2006.  While it still works most of the time, I frequently have to take multiple pictures of the same scene due to inconsistent focusing.The Canon (ELPH 150 IS) is marketed with as a 24mm wide-angle with a 10X optical zoom, plus digital zoom. While the difference in the wide angle aspect is just 1 mm, I can see the difference in comparison photos taken on a tripod in my backyard. However, my Kodak's photos are less clear; whereas the Canon's details are very sharp.  Clearly the difference is in the sensor, as the Canon is a 20 megapixel camera vs my 5 megapixel Kodak. Additionally, the Kodak's details are washed out in my photos with white stucco, whereas the Canon photos are well defined.The Canon is marketed with many features.  Upon receipt yesterday, I thought there was a typo in the Canon literature as I could not access the special effects.  The \"instructions\", a double sided large sheet are next to worthless, including a reference to the full manual on Canon's web site, which were nonexistent.  A phone call to Canon support corrected this oversight as the Canon tech pointed me to an instruction manual for the ELPH 140 that is also applicable to this ELPH 150 IS. Additionally, while the tech could not access many of the camera's functions at first, he directed me to perform a reset to factory defaults, which solved all.  This camera can do a lot.  The 120 page manual is well written, but don't try to absorb all the options in one reading, as it will put you to sleep.OK, do I like it?  It's a point and shot with a 24-mm wide angle/10X optical telephoto lens that is smaller than my wallet.  It will do all that I need and fit comfortably in my pocket. I am not happy about the protruding lens, but that's an easy tradeoff from my old camera.  In taking inside and outside photos I am impressed.  The color details in macro photos are rich.  The flash, while not powerful, surprisingly provided well-lit photos of my dark, two-car garage. Cycle time with the flash is slow; perhaps 2 to 5 seconds.  In setting the flash to auto, the camera provided quality photos of my home, inside and outside without any adjustments on my part. Hair-line cracks in crown moldings were explicit using the telephoto with and without the flash. While I would not rate this camera a ten or even a 9, a 7.5 seems fair for this $150 point and shoot as it meets my needs.Some things I do not like include inability to charge the battery while in the camera. Slow cycle time in burst mode. Protruding lens when in use (as I tend to bang things around when I am working). Additionally, selecting some of the camera's special functions is difficult to find within the double-function controls.", "Date": "March 22, 2014"}, {"Title": "Sent it back...", "Author": "Anana", "ReviewID": "RRUOF4U5UWC6H", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have a Canon PowerShot camera from 7 years ago that I absolutely love...reading the description for this product I thought it would be the same type of camera, but with extra megapixels, etc.  Instead, I was highly disappointed.The body feels very cheap.  The LCD screen is very grainy and low quality (my old one had a better LCD!!!).  I took some shots outside, inside, stills and action to test it out and the only shots that turned out good on \"auto\" mode were the ones in perfect lighting with no movement.  The low lighting ones were blurry.  Even after looking at the shots on the PC (thinking maybe it was the poor LCD screen), you could see how bad the image quality was.I tried some shots with manual tweaking and the menus had changed from my old unit - not such a big deal, but some of the features were not as easy to access or change as the older model.Sent this back, as it was not as fabulous as the description makes it sound.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Horrible photo quality.", "Author": "Horse Racing Fan", "ReviewID": "R2PSV6GY341YHS", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I'm an appraiser and recently dropped and broke my Canon SD 960 IS. Because it was a few years old, I thought it would be a good idea to replace it with the new Canon 150 IS. BIG MISTAKE! The quality of the photos taken outside in the sunlight is decent, but the quality of interior photos is abysmal, especially if the lighting is less than perfect. Also, the interior photos seem to have a cartoonish quality to them and the flash seems weak. If you primarily take outside photos in the daylight, then this camera may be adequate. But if most of your photos are interior shots like mine, then I would highly recommend skipping the Canon 150 IS.", "Date": "March 20, 2014"}, {"Title": "Good Basic Camera", "Author": "PDS", "ReviewID": "R3RX9E1J967PAH", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Easy to use right right out of the box, if you have a memory card since one does not come with the camera.
