{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Pros and Cons Make It Difficult to Give a Star-rating", "Author": "Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "ReviewID": "REN8XYC3468YY", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I wanted a small point-and-shoot camera that I could easily stash in my purse for quick snapshots, and I settled on the Olympus T-100 because of price and my outstanding experience with an Olympus Stylus. I expected a no-frills camera with good optics and ease-of-use; I was looking for value and small size. Although I got what I expected -- and for that the T-100 deserves a five-star rating--the camera has other limitations and flaws that consumers should weigh against the cost and the competition. Note: all the 12MP T-100s -- red, blue, black, and silver-- are the same except for the body color.Pros: sharp 12 MP pictures in an inexpensive camera; rechargeable lithium battery (which some people may view as a con); a lens cover that is recessed when closed so that does not open easily if you accidentally brush against it; built-in flash that can be set to go off either automatically or only on demand; a sizable LCD screen for composing and viewing photos; the ability to focus on an object, then compose the photograph with it no longer in the center (shutter button halfway down before snapping); menu functions that actually work -- self-timer, macro, portrait, landscape, sports, etc. -- 21 in all; VGA movie mode to shoot brief videos; SDHC memory card-compatible (Olympus used to have their own XD card format); image stabilization; 3x zoom; ability to zoom in and out while shooting video; battery can be charged using either a regular outlet or a powered USB port; adjustable compression and picture quality settings.Cons: the housing is mostly plastic, making it feel only one step up from a disposable camera; no memory card included, not even one that will hold a few photos; battery must charge inside camera, making it difficult to prepare extra batteries for a trip; battery does not arrive charged, as many companies are doing today; with few outside buttons, most features need to be activated through the on-screen menu, making it cumbersome to switch from one to another; a somewhat thick body with rectangular corners on one side which makes it awkward to slip into a pocket; a user manual and software on CD that is only usable on a Windows machine; it takes a while to figure out the menu items.The camera comes with a lithium battery, a wrist strap; a charger with USB cable; and a software/manual disc that works only on Windows machines. If you order this, you should buy at the same time an SDHC card such as Transcend 8 GB Class 6 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC6. This camera has been marketed as ideal for teenagers, primarily because of the cost but also because of the ease of use. Of course, it also means that adults might be disappointed with its construction. It is definitely not as high-tech/cool-looking as the other small point-and-shoots in the Nikon and Canon lines. I'd give it 4 stars for the photographic quality, 3 stars for aesthetics and housing; 5 stars for overall value.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "Date": "April 23, 2010"}, {"Title": "Get wat u pay for", "Author": "athli", "ReviewID": "R1UQUEIASS2NW4", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "This product has several crappy things and some good things about it.Crappy:Menu is hard to figure out and menu selection is painfulLCD screen is of low resolutionNice ones:Light and handyOnly camera at this price range providing rechargable batteriesNice picture and video outputAltogether its value for the money u pay for.

It is quick and easy to use, has great picture quality, and is a perfect camera for teens.  Its \"point-and-shoot\" feature is extremely useful for pics of sports, as it captures the picture swiftly.  This camera is definitely one of the best cameras for this price.  One thing some people commented on was how the \"shell\" was plastic and probably not very durable, but it looks pretty tough, and would not break if you were careful with it.  I found a good review for this camera here:http://www.amazon.com/review/R37ZL8Q60RQTTP/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B0036VNPGG&nodeID;=&tag;=&linkCode;=Thank you Olympus and Amazon for this great item!", "Date": "January 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good deal", "Author": "Camila", "ReviewID": "R6KTDO633EYPB", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I bought this camera for my mom.It arrived before the expected. The camera is very light, but it's good. It has different effects and a good zoom.I have a Canon and it is much better, but if you're looking for a good deal (cheap camera for a low price), this could be it.The only problem is that you need to charge the battery in the camera, so you can't leave a battery charging while you use the camera, as I usually do with Canon.

St full zoom,i could see another cruise ship about twenty miles away. Without the camera, it was just a tiny spec. For all of you out there that think that a megapixel is the quality of an image, its only the size. the quality is to be measured in pixels per square inch. Sort of like thread count on a sheet. The only downside to this camera is that although it takes video, it has no speaker. At the final night on the cruise, they sang a song, and i recorded it, only to find that the camera doesnt have a speaker.", "Date": "December 31, 2010"}, {"Title": "Olympus T-100 Digital Camera", "Author": "brodgers", "ReviewID": "R18ISQNVA9JUNY", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I have purchased several Olympus digital cameras in the past. I am very pleased with the performance and features. Although the 12mp picture quality is available, I seldom use that level of quality. It is very difficult to send very large video files over the internet. The video recording feature is certainly functional, not the best in low lighting but fine in general use.

It turns out that the 5 year old Kodak easy-share takes better pictures!  As some have said, it IS impossible to get a nice/clear picture on this camera.  I own two other Olympus cameras - one P&S;, and a micro four thirds.  The T-100 doesn't even compare to the quality I expect from an Olympus camera.The DPI is very low, at something barely over 100 (maybe 112) and it doesn't get any better.  This was at 12MP, using the \"fine\" setting for the least amount of compression the camera has to offer.The construction of the camera makes it feel like a toy.Do not think you are getting a good deal by buying this camera, because you are certainly not.", "Date": "December 20, 2010"}, {"Title": "Cheap Plastic Garbage", "Author": "JACQUELINE M WHITE", "ReviewID": "R2BLCWF552IOTT", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera to replace my Kodak Easy Share.
