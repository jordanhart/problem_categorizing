{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Edited Review - Battery Door Problem", "Author": "Stephen G. Ayres", "ReviewID": "R2MHWIQD1DM5PD", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "It is with regret that I must edit my review on the Nikon L24.Because of a weak design on the battery cover door I cannot recommend this camera.  However, I am leaving the original review below this addition because everything I originally wrote about the operation still stands.  The 1-star rating I'm now leaving reflects the inadequate closure design and Nikon's refusal to replace the battery cover under warranty.The battery door cover on mine broke just like the others who have written about the L20 / L24 series Nikon cameras.  My defect made itself known to me after 6 months of use.  There was never any abuse, no drops, no bumps, camera was kept in a case except when I was taking or transferring pictures.The lip on the inside of the battery door gave way as I was taking a picture - the door popped open and the batteries dropped at my feet.  It took me a minute or two with reading glasses to see exactly what happened and where the breakage/weakness was.For those interested, I have close-up pictures of the broken area and they can be seen on this page:[..link removed..]When I contacted Nikon about this, I was instructed to send in the camera for evaluation.  I did (it was worth a $6 gamble).  After they got the camera, I was told that the repair would cost approximately $50.  I replied back stating that I felt that it was a design flaw and that the repair should be covered under warranty.  In a subsequent reply, I was told that the issue is not repairable under warranty but the repair itself would be warrantied for 6 months in case another similar failure occurred.I chose to NOT pay $50 to repair a $100 camera and will attempt a repair myself later.  In the meantime, I'll tape the door closed with electrical tape.Again...*** I cannot recommend the purchase of this camera due to the weak design of the battery door ***.  The cover is under constant pressure from the battery springs and the design of the plastic lip is inadequate to take this pressure.My advice to existing owners whose cameras have not broken YET is to take the pressure off of the poorly designed door that is subject to breaking by stretching a piece of good-quality electrical tape to secure the door.Other than the flimsy battery door design, this IS a good camera.  Nikon really should be covering this repair under warranty and I'll be sure the check for similar design flaws if I ever consider another Nikon camera purchase.--------------------------------------------Original review below--------------------------------------------Disclaimer:  This particular review isn't being written from an avid photographer's point of view.I needed a small, inexpensive, good-quality, easy-to-use camera for my job.  My main use for this camera is taking good, clear indoor before/after photos of various electronic devices and related components.  My requirements are a large LCD viewer, the ability to use common AA batteries, have my settings (date/time, photo mode) retained after batteries were removed and replaced, and a quick way to transfer images to my PC's that doesn't rely solely on a USB cable.Preferring not to have to deal with camera angle or cumbersome tricks to reduce flash reflection from shiny surfaces, I was hoping to find something that would allow effective non-flash settings where a semi steadily-held camera could take clear, acceptable indoor pictures as required by the companies that I do work for.As much as I tried, I could not get good, consistent results with the e510 but I seem to have found that camera with the L24.So far with the L24, I've taken pictures of HDTV televisions (displays powered both on and off), PCB boards, product labels, macro shots of venting capacitors, etc. - *all without flash*, using only ambient room lighting.For me, time is an important factor and with these onsite job shots, I do not have the time or desire to do pre-shot adjustments or after-processing like resizing, gamma-tweaking, or cropping.  The shots I take need to be ready to be attached to an email or be uploaded to technician portals.  The settings that I have found that work for me is the  \"white balance\" and \"motion detect\" set for auto, resolution set for 1024x768 (for email-ready small file and dimension), and flash set for \"off\".As long as my subjects aren't in the shadows, the camera is held relatively steady, and the images framed properly, my pictures are clear and all I have to do once I return home is transfer to my PC, attach and send.  The settings as described above allow clear pictures for my uses in both regular and macro modes.The camera remembers my settings with its AA batteries out and its 3\" LCD viewer lets me verify a good shot (they've all been pretty good so far).Connectivity:All of my PC's have a card slot that accommodates the SD type, so if the included UC-E6 cable isn't handy, I remove the SD card from the camera and transfer images that way.  If I needed more of these cables, I can get them for $4 each on eBay.You don't have to use a SD card (camera has 17MB built-in) but I do recommend using a card for the extra storage and image-transfer/connectivity options.When buying a SD card, consider the card-reading compatibility with your existing equipment if you intend on using using the card to transfer images.  Some card readers do not read SDHC (high-capacity) cards, I was aware of this potential compatibility issue beforehand and bought a standard SD 2GB (not a SDHC) card.I'm sure once more people buy this camera, more features than I covered will be discussed.  There are settings on the L24 that I will probably never use.  In my quick tour through the menu settings (haven't read the manual yet - haha) I didn't see where you can manually adjust aperture or shutter speed independently but there is an exposure control.  The lack of manual settings might be a minus for serious photographers but like I said before, photography isn't a hobby for me - I just want to take good pictures easily and quickly.", "Date": "April 7, 2011"}, {"Title": "Good Compact Digital Camera", "Author": "Sean Ng", "ReviewID": "R2W6XLQ2UFTWJN", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I purchased this camera for quick access during vacation and travel.

I calmly explained that wasn't the case AND that we had a friend with the same camera and same problem!  ALSO, you can read the reviews of this camera on various sites (or the L-22) to see that it's a common gripe.  They would not fix it and wanted $93.

My 75 year old father saw how easy it is to use and the quality of the photos and asked me to get one for him.

Also, just a tip, if you do buy this camera be sure to buy a memory card, the actual camera has hardly any memory at all. Im fortunate to have kept mine from my last camera. Anyhow, I reccomend this camera. Nikon is (in my opinion) the best camera company out there, I have used their cameras for personal/recreational and business use.

When she returned we sent it back again and after another month or so we got a call from Nikon and was told that it was no longer under warranty.  I went great detail to voice my complaint and was told by the rep she would need to discuss it with the supervisor and would get back to me.  Another month want by. Nikon called and said the repair was about $100. and the best they would do is fix it for half price. Needless to say I told them to shove it! They sent me the broken camera back.

I did alot of research and chose this camera because it was simple without alot of frills and buttons AND best of all, it works on AA batteries.  I was hunting for a new camera for my 75 year old mother who would actually prefer to have her old 35 mm camera back.  My mom needs a simple point and shoot that will take consistent pictures and takes batteries she won't have to worry about charging or keeping track of a charging cord.  She is going on a vacation and on her last trip, she kept forgetting to charge her camera batteries.  I thought this camera fit all of my requirements but the picture taking is inconsistent.I tried the camera out first and kept the camera primarily in Easy Auto Mode so that I would not have to fool with changing the scene modes but the flash was inconsistent.  The flash only worked about a third of the time so the indoor pictures were not always good.  I read the manual but can't figure out why the flash was inconsistent.  The outdoor pictures were good but on the longest zoom, the pictures were blurry.When the flash worked (indoors) and the longest zoom wasn't used (outdoors)the pictures were awesome and made me think great camera! But like I said, this was not consistent- even when I took pictures of the same thing back to back.  Also, I put a high speed memory card in the camera but the camera still took anywhere from 3 to 7 seconds to recover from a picture and it was frustrating waiting to take the next picture.  And, in auto mode, the camera would sometimes take longer to adjust itself.  But I will say that when the camera did take a longer time to adjust, the pictures came out very nice.  And, when I changed the scene modes and exposures and megapixels, I was able to change the quality of the pictures.All in all, I had high hopes for this camera based on the great reviews and the features this camera but I was disappointed when the camera did not perform as hoped.  My mom is not at all technological and she would get frustrated with trying to figure this camera out.

She had been using a few year old hand down camera I gave her and I thought that any modern camera would be a step up from that one.  I was wrong.I could give a more comprehensive review of the issues with this camera, but it's a sub $100 camera so I will just point out the most significant flaw of this camera from my perspective.  A flaw that many other cameras in this class do not have.After my wife took 50 or so pics she asked me to get them off the camera and onto her computer.  Typically what I do is put them on my computer first, cull the obviously terrible pics and then do some light editing of the rest (crop, rotate, straighten, color correct).  I ended up deleting about half of them because they were so out of focus the subject was unrecognizable.With her previous camera there was the occasional really out of focus pic, but with the L24 around half were.  Curious as to why this would be I grabbed her camera and started playing with it.  That's when I saw the fatal flaw with this camera.  It's auto focus is unacceptably slow under most conditions.  By unacceptably slow I mean 1-2 seconds under conditions her 3 year old camera would focus on near instantaneously.  What happens is she presses the shutter button half way and then all the way thinking the pic will be in focus. It often isn't because the camera has not finished focusing.I had to show her that the camera's reticule turns green and the camera beeps and until that happens she should not press the button fully.  We were both amazed how long it took the camera to finish focusing.", "Date": "December 19, 2011"}, {"Title": "Another AMAZON bargain!", "Author": "JK's girl \"Scullery Maid\"", "ReviewID": "R1EHWBAJ4LV4G8", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "I had nothing but trouble with the previous digital camera I bought in 2008 from the competition..

Honestly, I've gotten better pictures from disposable cameras! The few pictures I took outside were okay, but I spent the majority of the week indoors at a chorus convention. I tried every setting on the camera, and STILL couldn't get a decent shot. If the lighting was low, the picture was ridiculously blurry and noisy even with a flash. And if the lighting was good, the flash was so bright, everyone/thing in the picture was way overexposed. If I turned off the flash, the picture was blurry. I just couldn't win!

I got it as a gift, my last camera was a Kodak Easy Share, one of the older models, and I LOVED it.  But it was too big to carry around with me all the time so I asked for a little camera for my birthday and got the Nikon \"cool\"pix.  The only thing cool about this camera is it's size.  After the first 2 months of owning it the battery cover broke. And it was never dropped or man-handled. So I had to have a big ugly piece of tape on my brand new camera. I realized very quickly that this thing devoured energy.  I would put a new set of top of the line batteries in and after using it maybe a total of 2-3 hours, it was dead.  For this reason I switched to using rechargable batteries and it sucked the life out of them even quicker.  There is nothing more frustrating than thinking you have plenty of battery power and going to use your camera at a crucial moment and it dies on you.  And good luck catching those spontanious special moments that you leave your camera on and waiting for, like at a wedding or suprise birthday party or your childs first steps, because by the time it decides it's ready to snap the shot, the moment has long passed you by. To make a long story short, I wouldn't even GIVE this camera away after I buy a new one.

This one's all plastic.In addition, the only good pictures I got were in bright, but indirect, sunlight. That's pretty limiting. Direct sunlight leads to washout, and overcast or indoor lighting conditions mean the flash is mandatory-- everything is blurred and/or grainy without it.Probably you can't expect much more for the price, but I would gladly sacrifice half the megapixel capacity for a sturdier camera with a higher ISO. 14 MP is totally wasted when you can't take clear pictures in anything less than perfect light.", "Date": "January 6, 2014"}, {"Title": "great for the begin!!", "Author": "matthew Sanders", "ReviewID": "RGK3HQQNOJY2L", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "A great little point and shoot and easy to work, But the lens is a little fragile went it out. so Be careful!!", "Date": "December 30, 2013"}, {"Title": "At least the battery door never broke.", "Author": "William J.

Pretty easy to use, lightweight cute little camera with very clear photos, way better results than I ever used to get on any other camera. Discreet also, the size of your palm, so you can take people photos quickly, snapping without the subject realizing they are being photographed. Was advised that if battery door left closed permanently, the batteries would trickle discharge, which I felt was a nuisance - what other device requires this? At the price for the special lithium ones I was certainly keen to retain any battery life possible, especially as on one occasion in heavy tourist mode I used up a pair in one day. To me this type of battery is not particularly easy to find and varies greatly in cost so equally don't want to be obliged to carry masses of spares on holiday. Not totally straightforward on whether you can suppress the flash function but it can take pretty good photos in low light situations in compensation. Seems currently to be slower at finally focusing than it used to be but handy dandy overall  - EXCEPT, as many others have said here, BE WARNED - a couple of months after purchase the door flew open and the batteries dropped out - the catch has to be the flimsiest in the world against formidable pressure from the batteries - I now keep it closed with a heavy duty rubber band but it really is a nuisance because clearly it is a major DESIGN FAULT and should be be fully addressed by Nikon, who should not expect everyone affected to pay through the nose for a \"repair\".", "Date": "February 3, 2013"}, {"Title": "GREAT CAMERA", "Author": "patricia", "ReviewID": "R30UV6H3G2K6GT", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "GREAT CAMERA, ITE M EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED & SAVE ME A GOOD DEAL OF MONEY.

Cheap, yes, but a Nikon should still take good pictures.  If you are outside or even inside with PLENTY of natural light, it's fine.  But if you are in an even remotely low light situation, the pictures are extremely blurry.  As far as I can tell this is because the flash doesn't flash in all low light situations AND there is no \"switch\" to force the flash.  You can toggle between auto flash and no flash.  If you only want a cheapo camera to take to the beach or hiking, then it's fine.  But if you want to try to take good pictures indoors of your kiddos, it's trash.

It is clear to me that with all the complaints I have seen here and other places that this is a design flaw in their camera.  Needles to say I am looking for a new camera.  Also needles to say Nikon will not be on the list for a replacement as their warranty is not worth the paper it is written on.  Shame on you Nikon, and Buyer Beware.Continued...  I asked Nikon to send back my camera they said that they could do that and said they were sorry that I was not satisfied that my camera would cost so much to repair and tried to explain why.  They then said it showed signs of physical damage and had a broken screen.  It fine when I sent it in and I told them so.  They then sent me pictures of the camera with the broken screen.... guess what it was not even my camera...  I responded back to the about that and I have not heard from them in over a week.  Their site says they will get back within 24 hours....  I think I have been sent into a black hole.  we have had several emails over the last month but I am getting nowhere.", "Date": "May 24, 2012"}, {"Title": "A Lemon Camera with no Corporate Backing", "Author": "Jim White", "ReviewID": "R3GPMJZS63AG91", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "After my experience with this model, I cannot in good faith recommend this camera or any Nikon product to anybody. I purchased the Coolpix L24 digital camera (red) for approximately $100 at a Wal-Mart in Greenville, SC in October 2011. It looked sharp and had a lot of nice features and I thought it to be a wise and economical purchase. However, when I actually started using it, I noticed that it had some problems that I was willing to overlook. (unfortunately none were within the 15-day return limit at Wal-Mart) The delay on the actual picture (time between snapping and capturing image was a little long in my opinion) and the zoom feature had issues - worked about 3/4 time. However, the final straw for me was on a trip to Tennessee in April 2012. While trying to capture family pictures of my wife's relatives (most of whom I hadn't ever met), the camera inexplicably stopped working. The lcd screen turned black and left an incoherent image on the screen. Since the camera was only 7 months old and had a 12-month warranty, I hoped that Nikon would make it right and either repair it free or refund my money. (I was hoping for the latter). Unfortunately, neither happened. After sending the camera in to Nikon, I received a letter back saying it was not covered under warranty and would be $105 to fix. After sounding off to the service number (800) 645-6678 about the poor quality of the camera (I was not happy that the invoice was trying to blame me saying it was caused by impact damage), he gave me another number to call (631) 547-4200, which led me to (800) 645-6687. After wasting 20 minutes talking to outsourced customer service - a conversation where the representative repeatedly tried to tell me to send my camera in to be fixed (if they listen to the recording - I think I made it abundantly clear 3 or 4 times that is exactly what I did). I'm not sure it ever registered to him that i found it absurd for them to expect me to pay $105 to repair a lemon camera. I also told him and the other representative not to ship it back to me. The second rep actually said it was free and couldn't understand why I didn't want it shipped back. Do people actually think stuff is free? I was looking out for their bottom line (i'm a CPA). In the end, the 2nd representative said he would email my complaint to management on Monday. The bottom line here is that if you are willing to settle for a camera that will only last 7 months and break, have issues from the getgo, not be honored under the warranty, and have to call about several different numbers to complain without really gettting service, then this is the camera for you.", "Date": "May 20, 2012"}, {"Title": "Nikon L24", "Author": "Tom", "ReviewID": "R337GAM1MCCYLB", "Overall": "1.0", "Content": "This is my sixth Nikon camera purchase and I must say I am very disappointed.

Your customer service representative told me that the L24 and L22 cameras in your service center have never experienced this problem.  I challenge you to go to any on-line customer review and look at the number of instances where this exact failure has been noted.  Your representative acknowledged that breakage of the battery door has been complained about many times in the past,  Despite this, Nikon denies that there is a problem. because none of the cameras in the service center have ever experienced battery door failure.  When I purchased this camera nine months ago, I read all of these reviews and told myself that I was a careful camera-user.  I  assumed that that everyone else must be mishandling their camera, but this is apparently not the case since my camera broke on its own inside my shirt pocket.2.  I was told that the warranty does not cover breakage.  Isn't this convenient that the problem is one of breakage of a poorly designed plastic part and your warranty denies any responsibility?Despite this, I was tempted to pay the $29 service charge to have my camera fixed.  But when told that I would have to pay an additional $15 for return shipping, I told your customer service representative to keep my camera:  $29 + $15 = half of what I paid for the camera originally.===========================email received from Nikon Service Center===========================From: Nikon Inc.

When I called Nikon technical services they suggested that I take the batteries and storage device from the camera for 24 hours.  Still on vacation, four more days remaining and I do not have a working camera.  Can't wait to return it to Amazon and believe me, I will stear clear of Nikon products in the future.  Bummer of vacation when photos can't be made to remember scenery.Nikon COOLPIX L24 14 MP Digital Camera with 3.6x NIKKOR Optical Zoom Lens and 3-Inch LCD (Silver)", "Date": "May 6, 2011"}, {"Title": "I am new and Amazon is user friendly", "Author": "DazyDeb", "ReviewID": "R2QSUROY5K2CP0", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Hi,  I am very new to Amazon and it has been an amazing experience, I placed an order and had to cancel and it was handled so great Thank You and well everything that has been purchased until now has been wonderful...
