{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Works great for honda ridgeline", "Author": "Olga Stewart \"Stew\"", "ReviewID": "R2Y1P8IAGRYO91", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I upgraded my 2010 ridgeline with , this camera, a camera tailgate handle, and a screen in the drop down sunglasses holder. This camera works great with the OEM Honda part that the upper level Ridgelines have. Once I got the camera aligned I added a dot of hot glue on the back side to keep the camera from spinning, just encase. When standing at the corner of the back of my truck, my wife said she could not see my hand at the end of the bumper, she could see my feet directly below the end of the bumper. This view is affected by the angle the oem handle is set at. I'll update if the camera fails too soon. No issues with view or quality.", "Date": "December 18, 2012"}, {"Title": "Sv6703", "Author": "Hornytoad", "ReviewID": "R1N1OGNBMERVB0", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Nice camera, very small about the size of a dime. Wish it had the option of no back up lines but I can live with it. Installed in my tailgate under my logo.

I had previously purchased an XO brand HTC35.  I like the size of this Crimestopper, but the picture is misleading.  It shows the camera and then the female 12v connection along with a female video lead.  Well what is actually in the box is the camera, followed by a black and red wire that you must wire yourself and a MALE video cable. There is no female 12v connection like the Amazon picture shows.  Now I have to go to RadioShack and get the correct parts because I wasn't sold what was advertised.", "Date": "January 12, 2013"}], "ProductInfo": {"Price": "$99.95", "Features": "Ultra Small Clip-On Style\n170 Degree Viewing Angle\nMinimum Illumination: 0.2 Lux\nIp67 Environmental Rating (Dust & Water Resistance)\n3-Year Limited Warranty When Installed By Authorized Safetyplus Dealer", "Name": "Crimestopper SV-6703 Flush Mount Camera", "ImgURL": "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41NQSbFUxcL._SY300_.jpg", "ProductID": "B004T38JRA"}}
