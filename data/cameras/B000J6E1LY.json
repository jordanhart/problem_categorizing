{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A Real Photographer's Tool", "Author": "Charles", "ReviewID": "R3SKCBI493GJKM", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The V-lux does many things right, and the disadvantages are minor.After spending an hour with the camera in my living room this evening, I am very impressed with how well it is designed for convenient use. Although the camera manual is over 100 pages long, I only had to check it two times to access all of the needed photographic controls. The lens zoom is controlled by a smoothly rotating mechanical ring, just like an SLR zoom lens. Autofocus, macro focus, and manual focus are switched with an easily accessible switch on lens barrel. There's also a focus button right below that switch to engage the autofocus even when in manual mode. This is terrifically useful.All of the common settings are quickly accessible through the function button, and no matter what you're doing with settings or picture review, partially pressing the shutter release returns instantly to shooting mode. Again, it's very well thought out as a photographer's tool.The image stabilization is very effective. I was able to hand hold shots in my living room at 1/5 of a second with little evident camera shake in the photograph. Of course it cannot overcome all shaking, and not all photos were free of some blur from shaking, but I was very pleased with the improvement.The lens is remarkable. If you've ever used a 12x zoom on an SLR (like one of those Tamron or Sigma zooms) you might not expect much from such a lens design. Leica have lived up to their reputation, however, with this lens. It provides sharp, contrasty images with very little curvature of field (slight at the widest angle and gone quickly as you zoom in). There is no evident vignetting.The body of the camera is sturdy with an actual, solid door over the connectors (not one of those flimsy pieces of rubber found on most cameras). The camera balances well, and with a hand under the lens for support it's easy to hold steady. The lens barrel is metal, and the provided lens hood fits securely (with the lens cap still useable while the hood is in place).The fact that the LCD screen swivels down rather than to the side is another very well thought out design that is uncommon. The LCD screen remains more centered on the body when it's folded down, encouraging a more stable hold on the camera. It also more easily allows shooting from the waist than cameras with screens that fold out to the side. This can make it more easy to take candid photos, for example.The two most common negative comments about the V-lux 1 are that the photos can be noisy and lose detail at ISO above 200, and that there is no reason to pay more for the Leica version of the camera compared to the Panasonic version (FZ-50).The images taken above ISO 200 are better than I expected from the reviews, and the issue is really no different for other digital cameras with small sensors (e.g. almost everything that is not a full-sized SLR). The image sabilizer, however, allows using a lower, less noisy ISO in many situations when one would otherwise turn up the ISO. Also, it's important to remember that the online reviews tend to concentrate on the full-size appearance of photographs on screen. The actual printed photographs will look much better. If you really need noise-free images at high ISO then you'll get a full SLR. The V-lux is not trying to compete with that niche use. For taking indoor shots at family dinners for printing at normal sizes (up to 8x10, for example), the noise at higher ISO shouldn't be a big concern in my view. When I used film cameras (a Leica M6 for many years), I shot more than 80% of my photographs on ISO 100 slide film. The V-lux 1 provides excellent results at ISO 100 (essentially identical to a full SLR by objective measurement), and a lot more control and versatility than my old M6 (a traditional mechanical rangefinder camera with seriously good Leica lenses).The other criticism made in reviews is that the Panasonic version is less expensive for the same camera. They certainly share the same lens and body, but Leica has adjusted the image processing to provide more smooth jpeg images, use less aggressive noise reduction (to retain more detail at ISO above 200), and to match the color and contrast characteristics of traditional film shot with Leica cameras. I miss the color palette of Leica lenses that I used to see in my photographs with my Leica M6, and I'm very glad that the V-lux is tuned to provide that. To me, this is a significant advantage since the rich but not cartoonish or unatural Leica color rendition is unique and beautiful. In addition, Leica includes an SD card that holds about 80 photographs at maximum resolution. I'll get a 2Gb card, but this is a very useable backup.All in all I'm extremely pleased. The V-lux 1 is a real photographer's tool capable of producing results like a full SLR in over 80% of the situations that I would encounter. And in the other 20% it still performs quite well (as well as any non-SLR digital camera) for modest-sized prints and for use online and in e-mail. The tradeoffs, in my view, are minor.Addendum: I just got the Lowepro Rezo TLZ 20 case and the camera fits perfectly inside (I don't use the camera strap). The top is a bit stiff, but otherwise the case has a soft interior, an unobtrusive storage flap for extra memory cards, and is about the most compact case there is for the camera (it seems comparable to the much more expensive Leica case).", "Date": "January 31, 2007"}, {"Title": "Quite Possibly The Best Digital \"Bridge\" Camera Currently Available", "Author": "John Kwok", "ReviewID": "R2XZ902Y9AFUPX", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "If you are seeking the finest in optical quality for a multiple purpose, noninterchangeable lens digital camera - what is commonly known as a \"bridge camera\" for combining some of the best features of digital SLRs with digital compacts - then look no further than the Leica V-Lux 1. True you are paying more by acquiring this version over its cheaper Panasonic sibling, but the advantages are obtaining a far more generous camera warranty and additional software improvements made by Leica. I've handled this camera several times at camera stores and digital imaging trade shows, and each time I have been quite impressed with how well it handles. Indeed, anyone who has handled a film or digital SLR camera before will be pleased with the relative ease in which one can use the Leica V-Lux 1, without having to refer frequently to its lengthy camera instruction manual. I am especially impressed with the optical image stabilizer (MEGA O. I. S.), which has allowed me to take photos hand held at shutter speeds as low as 1/10 a second (If my hands were steadier, then maybe I could get as low as 1/5 a second, which another reviewer has claimed.). I also appreciate the swivel 2.0\" TFT display, which offers the user complete freedom with regards to image framing and perspective. This looks like the perfect camera for travel, sports, and maybe, some landscape photography too. My only  major disappointment  with the Leica V-Lux 1 is that this camera seems noiser at ISO speeds higher than 200, with some noticeable loss in image quality, especially at the highest ISO speeds of 1600 and 3200. However, I think most users will be more impressed with the possibility of using ISO speeds as low as 80 and 100, in a camera that has a shutter speed range from 1 to 1/2000 seconds in most of its modes, and an aperture range of f2.8 to 11 (at its widest wide angle setting) and f3.7 to 11 (at its telephoto setting). The superb Leica-designed, Panasonic-built Leica CD Vario-Elmarit 7.4-88.8mm f2.8 - f3.7 ASPH zoom lens (equivalent to 35 - 420mm in 35mm film format) is truly an optical jewel, offering superb performance that is on par with the best Zeiss zoom  Sony Cybershot lenses.", "Date": "February 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "The Leica I've been waiting for!", "Author": "JFD \"MrHuey\"", "ReviewID": "RTWYCYMJ3L860", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "First off, no I haven't used the Panasonic DMC-FZ50 and with a Leica lens it may be as good as the V-LUX 1 but it'll never be a Leica and it's not a Panasonic I've wanted my whole life!I just got the V-LUX 1 for Christmas and haven't truly given it a good thorough shakedown, but I experimented quite a bit on Tuesday and my first impression is a good one - all bias aside, really.The V-LUX 1 behaves like my old 35mm SLRs, fully automatic to fully manual and it does what I tell it to.  My cheaper digitals often delay before taking a picture, causing me to miss many action shots, both at sporting events and with my kids at play.  I'm constantly deleting pictures of empty fields and playgrounds, where the action once was but is no more.  My cheap digitals sometimes even refuse to take pictures they \"determine\" won't come out, the Leica takes the picture and let's me decide, just like my trusty old 35 mm SLR (I will miss it so).  The V-LUX 1 feels like my old SLRs, solid and sturdy (\"Substantial\" I like to call it), not light and hollow (\"Cheap I like to call it).If you're a 35mm holdout (as I still am at heart), not a believer in digital yet, you are correct, 10.1 MP doesn't hold a candle to 35mm ISO 64 film but it sure makes a nice 8x10.  It's a Leica and under a grand.  What's not to like?  I do love this camera.  Thank you Leica for bringing real photography to the sub $1,000 digital market!Bottom line - BUY IT (and a good 1 GB+ SD card)", "Date": "December 27, 2006"}, {"Title": "Leica V-Lux 1", "Author": "Federico Lawrence", "ReviewID": "R3KYKWO87XDYV3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "The Leica V-Lux 1 is a digital camera which combines high-performance optics and outstanding picture quality in a compact camera body. From spacious landscape shot, macro close-up shots through to photos of far distant objects in super telephoto mode, the lens with its 12 time zoom creates outstandings picture results in all photographic situations. The integral picture stabilizer gives the user additional protection against camera shake, even under difficult lighting conditions. While this camera is based on the Panasonic's DMC-FZ50 it has image processing adjustments as defined by Leica.

I work in dusty, sandy environments a lot, so I decided against an SLR--the Nikon I was replacing broke down because of excessive grit in the zoom mechanism despite daily cleaning, so I hate to think what would happen to a mirror-flipping mechanism.  I read the reviews for this camera, here and elsewhere, and debated the Panasonic equivalent, but decided on the Leica both on sentimental grounds (I learned photographyon my mom's 1940s Leica) and the fact that Leica tweaked the settings, and they know more about photography than Panasonic.  I've now had the camera for about seven months and I've taken thousands and thousands of photographs.  (A lot of reviews seem to me to be based on the first 24 hours.)  I am very, very happy with it.Outdoor photographs are wonderful, and the 16:9 ratio is great for landscapes.  But that's the easy part.  The indoor photographs are great.  (Most of these have been taken in museums and churches.)  At first I noticed a lot of noise in low light situations, but after playing around with the settings for a while, I don't seem to get it any more.  Most important:  Be sure to use Mode 2 Stabilization.  Mode 1 only stabilizes a little, all the time; Mode 2 stabilizes only when the shutter is pressed.  Using the self-timer also helps.  In a pinch, you can use exposure compensation to take an underexposed photograph and then push it using Photoshop.I like many things about this camera.  The exposure compensation works beautifully, once you get the hang of it.  It's also fairly easy to switch formats (16:9, 3:2, 4:3).  I've set up my own preferred profiles for various conditions, which makes it easy to switch a lot of settings at once (a church/museum setting without beeps, so people don't glare at me).  The viewfinder grid has saved me hours of straightening shots with Photoshop. And the manual is compact, well organized, indexed, and clear; it fits in my camera case.  And the pictures I take with this camera just seem to glow.The disadvantages are quite managable.  I thought I'd lose the lens cap, but I haven't; sticking it in my pocket means it doesn't accidentally get in my shots.  It's sometimes hard to get the auto-focus to work at a high zoom, particularly in dim light, which can be quite frustrating.  But with resolution like this, you can afford to back off a little.  And it is big and heavy, but that will make me strong.One always has a vested interest in liking a camera that one has paid a lot of money for, but I find I don't even window shop for the newest cameras any more.  I expect to use this one for another three or four years, at least.", "Date": "October 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "LEICA V lux 1- Above my expectations", "Author": "W. A. Kobling", "ReviewID": "R1O3NEBHT9Z6EU", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought this camera at the same time I purchased a Canon xti (digital SLR). I had owned Canon before and was very pleased with the company.I was VERY sure that I would keep the xti and sell the V lux 1. In fact I purchased several Canon lenses. Now that I have used both cameras for about year now, I have come to the conclusion that the V lux 1 takes better photographs.First to all, the Leica has a very versatile lens that takes clear pictures with great color reproduction. The camera has IN BODY image stabilization that works very well. It has a zoom that is mechanical 35- 420 and incorporates an additional optical choice of 2x or 4x. This is a tremendous choice of range that works well.The f-stops open up enough to get great photos indoors. The WB seems very accurate as well. It also has a quality lens.If you are the kind of photographer who wants an all-in-one lens-camera choice that is light, easy to use and takes VERY good 10MP pics this one may be for you.[...]", "Date": "November 27, 2008"}, {"Title": "Poor reliability and poor service", "Author": "Gary M.

But then after a few months it stopped working. I contacted service in NJ and sent it into then. They said I would have an answer back in \"2-3\" days. That turned into two weeks. My emails to then asking for status were deleted and not read (I asked for a read receipt). I finally got a letter from them to authorize the service (under warranty). Time estimate for the repair was 4-5 weeks. Nearly eight weeks later I am still waiting for it. I always considered Leica to be the Rolls Royce on cameras but unfortunately, in retrospect I wish I had bought a Canon or a Nikon.", "Date": "October 20, 2007"}, {"Title": "Just as good, if not better, than an entry level SLR", "Author": "dorel_c", "ReviewID": "R30OIXDJC6W0UW", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This is the best sub-SLR (bridge) camera there is out there.Enough has been written about this camera by others so I am not going to go over the same things again.Here are just a few points that I think are important, or have not been covered before.1. I saw that some people wrote that if you want to spend this money, you might as well buy a SLR camera kit. That is a misleading idea.Leica V-Lux 1 comes with a 35 to 430 mm original, best quality lens. There is no SLR kit on the market that covers that range at the same lens quality under $1000.00, let alone the fact that you don't have to carry two lenses to cover the same zoom range (focal distance).2. This is the only bridge camera that offers exactly the same controls like true SLR cameras, including dial controls for aperture and speed, placed just like the controls in the Nikon SLR series. Without taking the camera from your eyes you can adjust with your index and thumb, the aperture and the exposure speed (or the Program Shift as the case may be). In the same time, with your left hand you can adjust the zoom and the manual focus rings.3. Leica V-Lux 1, has some features encountered only in SLR-s much more expensive. In example, on the left side of the lens there is a \"forced\" Focus button. Even with the focus set to MANUAL mode, one can still touch with the left thumb this button and the lens focuses automatic. Then it remains further in manual mode, so you can continue to adjust it further by turning the focus ring.3. Here is one example of how great the image stabilization works. Last week I was at my son's convocation ceremony that took place indoors in a sports arena, but it was not lit enough. My son was sitting in the middle of the stadium. I was standing all the way up. With the camera held in my hand and with the maximum zoom, I took about three pictures. One out of three came out perfectly clear. Now consider this: the exposure was 1/16sec which would absolutely require a tripod.Further I just leaned my right elbow on a railing and then took some more pictures, and they all came out very clear at 1/8 and 1/16 sec!4. One word of caution: If you are used to other cameras that in Auto mode allow choices on metering, focus area, etc, this camera in Auto mode offers very little options. If you want access to all the settings, you have to set it to \"P\" (Program Mode) which is also an \"automatic\" mode that allows all the settings to be changed.5. If money is tight, but you would really like to get the Leica as opposed to the equivalent Panasonic, if you shop around you find this camera at around $750 - $800. Also, look on the Leica web site as they are offering a $150 mail in rebate (March-Apr 2008, and again July-Aug 2008, and I am sure they will offer it again), so you end up paying $600 - $650, which all of a sudden looks a lot more as a very good value.A great, high quality camera.", "Date": "August 28, 2008"}, {"Title": "6 Years After It Was Announced", "Author": "Carlton D. Garrard", "ReviewID": "R33U6MYCQPMVPR", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This camera is still an excellent imaging device.Getting them used in near new condition isn't easy, but a lot cheaper than when they first came out. Compared to the Panasonic version- the improved exterior finish, Jpeg engine, aesthetics, and Leica service/warranty is worth the extra you'll pay for this camera today.Having a 35-420mm f/2.8-f3.7 internal zooming optic is unheard of in digital or analog imaging products (read again, the zoom is internal). Having an optic be this sharp at all of the f/stop range, and with such low distortion, is really a dream come true. If you want wider angle, just get the pana dmw-lw55 wide angle convertor, its high quality and gives you a 24mm equivalent view without deterioration of image quality.It's a small lens to carry in addition to the camera and I dare anyone to come up with such a compact focal range in DSLR land.Keep your exposures correct, pay attention to the histogram, shoot raw... and you can exceed DSLR quality images (optics being part of the equation here) that shoot at the same resolution.It's just as sharp at 420mm as it is at 35mm, not deterioration in quality- that is also a secret of this lens and something you will not find in modern day superzooms (as of todays writing).It's classy in appearance, performance, and features- one of those cameras that is rare and likely to not be produced again.
