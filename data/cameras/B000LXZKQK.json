Stauber \"Bob_NJ\"", "ReviewID": "R3I2SLESHXMO3J", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I got the camera about  a week ago and highly recommend it. If you buy this camera, I recommend getting an H type card which is much faster than the M type for taking pictures. Some movie functions do not work to full capability with the M type but do with the faster H type. I also recommend getting NIMH 2700 mah batteries and charger. Their higher capacity is worth the money  and will save over the long run.As far as the camera goes, I wish the camera was higher than 7.1 mp, but compared to my old 3.3 mp camera, the pictures are so much clearer and finer. The camera has many functions build in, and you will need to read the manual to get full use of the camera. Out of the box AUTO mode works well, but after reading the manual, I think most higher end users will want to set their own modes.Some nice included functions are the manual ability, the ability to choose among 15 different shooting types (such as through a window), and the ability to store raw images among others. Storing raw images is slow due to the large file size and can take several seconds on an M type card.Movie mode is able to take 30 fps at 640X480, but 15 fps is still good  quality. With the M type card you can only take 15 seconds of movies at full mode, but H type you can fill your memory card. The default setting for movies is without sound so you will need to turn this on. However, with sound turned on, I was not able to zoom, even with the H card.Image Stablization was nicely setup and can be set with just the push of a button rather than going through the Menu. Also, the eyepiece viewfinder is setup so that if the display on the back is on, the viewfinder is off and vice-versa. In fact when you use the eyepiece viewfinder, the picture that is normally displayed on the back is now in the eyepiece. I suppose this is good for taking pictures when it is too bright to see the back screen.Finally, I like to take weather  shots and this camera includes a time lapse mode, which I can put together with my old software (not Olympus) into a movie.[...]", "Date": "March 8, 2007"}, {"Title": "Perfect camera for the nature photographer", "Author": "William A.

I teach digital photography at the local college, and have several cameras, so I have a good basis for comparison.I shoot mostly nature subjects, and this camera acts like it was designed just for me.  For nature subjects you need telephoto and macro, and this camera shines at both ends.  Set to super macro it will focus at 1cm.  Thats less than 1/2 inch.  It has allowed me to shoot a honeybee that filled the frame.The 18x telephoto is clear and sharp, and perfect not only for birds at a distance, but lizards 8 feet away.  I bought the CLA-10 adapter and 1.7 teleconverter, so I can get 27x telephoto, and it is still clear.  The image stabilization is good enough that I can hand hold at 27x if necessary.The current lack of RAW support in Adobe products is being worked on, and the plug-in is expected shortly.If you shoot nature you will love this camera.

Not that their cameras weren't any good, it's just that they weren't anything special.  With the SP-550uz (and a few other cameras), Olympus has really stepped it up.First, this is one heck of a nice looking camera (the photos don't do it justice), and feels equally good in your hands (nice heft with the 4 AA batteries).  The dials looks sharp and appears to be solid.In operation, the camera works very well.  The tremendous 18x optical zoom is smooth and not too noisy.  The rear and internal LCDs are good, although I prefer the Sony internal LCD.  The selector dial is easy to read, and the extremely helpful photo/descriptions that appear when you set the dial make it easy to figure out how to use the camera.  Their \"guide\" mode is a wonderful addition for the beginner.The \"dual\" image stabalization is a nice touch (but not a cure-all).  The mechanical stabalizer is great for letting you hold the camera steady, but it doesn't really help as much for moving objects.  The high ISO mode is more properly called an anti-blur mode, as it simply boost the ISO.  This helps stop moving objects, but at a sacrifice in quality.  High ISOs simply aren't very good on compact cameras, period.Anyone who's read my reviews knows that I'm not a big fan of the xD cards.  They're OK, but not a easy to find, or priced as competitively, as the SD cards.Some recommended accessories are rechargable batteries and their lens adapter, if you think you might ever want to pick up filters or add-on lenses.  These are tubes are sometimes difficult to find when the cameras are first out, but are really difficult to find once they've been discountinued, so get one early.Overall, a camera at the top of the heap (along with the newly announced Sony DSC-H9).", "Date": "February 27, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent image quality with superb 18X optical zoom with optical stabilization, but no high speed USB and mediocre software", "Author": "Tennyson Lee", "ReviewID": "R3QETX9SY1YC03", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Images from this camera are very high quality.  The 18X optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes.  The optical image stabilization system (based on stabilizing the CCD image sensor instead of lens elements) is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances (moving car, boat, shaky hands).My main gripe with this camera is the lack of high speed USB 2.0 support.  The fine print says that the USB interface is \"full speed\" which means a maximum transfer rate of 12 Mbit/s instead of the 480 Mbit/s possible with high speed USB.  So, downloading photos from the camera through the USB interface is painfully slow compared to most current generation digital cameras such as a Canon SD900.The software provided with the camera is somewhat difficult to use and is slow and unresponsive.It would also be desirable if the camera could accept a lithium ion rechargeable battery in addition or instead of the 4 AA batteries it uses.  But, battery life with both alkaline and rechargeable NiMH AA batteries was adequate.", "Date": "March 13, 2007"}, {"Title": "Olympus SP-550UZ Great Choice for Programmed Modes", "Author": "Jeri J.

I have gotten good enough at photography that I needed more than the bottom end point and shoot cameras. I really needed at least a 10X optical zoom. I also do genealogy so needed a camera that has a macro lens so that I can copy photographs, documents, and microfilm off the reader.  When we found the SP-550UZ it seemed a great choice so that I don't have to carry around two or more lenses. It has a Macro and Super Macro lens as well as being able to go 18X Optical zoom (I never use the Digital zoom on any camera!).  I purchased this camera right before we left on vacation so I had time to play with it. I had no problem 'freezing' action on the sports scene mode. I got some really great photos through the windshield while we were moving at 70 MPH by panning with car movement.  It worked well on the Blue Ridge Parkway picking up the subtle greens and purples of the mountains and trees.  My husband was even jealous of the photos I took of my cousin's Koi fish in a pond in VA. I had it in Landscape+Portrait mode and they came out great.This camera has 23 modes so play with them when you get your camera so that you know which one to choose to get the depth of field you desire. The SP-550UZ is a great camera for someone that wants the help of the programmed modes while still giving you the ability to change settings as you learn more about photography.  It's handy document setting for working in the library on my genealogy sold me but the 18X optical zoom makes this a great all round camera in my book! I'm now recommending this camera for genealogists to get the best possible starting image when duplicating photos.

Transfer data time to the xD card is about one second after you take the picture if you use the highest JPEG setting. Only problem I am having is with the auto focus. Seems the pictures with the high end zoom just are not as clear as I would like, even with the anti-shake turned on. My old Olmpus was the 2100UZ which had great color accuracy and focusing, of course now it lags in technology compared to todays cameras. With the SP-550UZ the color acuracy is also extreamly good and the ease of controlls on this new camera are excellent. Battery life is very good.

The 18 x optical zoom is incredible, the image quality is just superb, the macro function allows you to take breathtaking close ups from as little as 1cm away with incredible detail and the image stabilization works better than any I have ever tried. Honestly, with the image stabilization working, even at maximum zoom the image in the LCD just kind of \"hovers\" slowly- almost like in slow motion whereas without this feature, the image would be shaking all over the place with even the slightest hand movement.

Full review can be found at [...]Overall the camera feels good to hold and does not seem at all fragile. However, the SP-550 is too large for purse or pocket use and is lacking in the features and image quality that would make it the ideal dedicated camera for intermediate and advanced users. So the target market will be hobbyists who are avoiding the advanced prosumer and DSLR models, yet wanting more features and zoom than the current crop of shirt pocket cameras offer.Photos did not give the sense of crisp sharpness I was hoping for. Noise issues, many of which can be dealt with in post-processing, were still abundant, and may be the main contributer to the soft feel of the SP-550's images. In all, I think the image quality is going to be the SP-550's main downfall among serious photographers.On the contrary, the strongest appeal will be to casual photographers who simply take vacation and family snapshots and occasionally need a longer zoom or a wider lens. Photographers who do embrace the SP-550 and eventually want the ability to explore more advanced photography techniques will find the camera to be a good stepping stone.", "Date": "March 28, 2007"}, {"Title": "Excellent camera overall......", "Author": "lordhoot \"lordhoot\"", "ReviewID": "R24XPGXK0SGVJS", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "Olympus SP550UZ proves to be an excellent camera with few minor weaknesses. First of all, the 18x zoom lens proves to be quite excellent. This range of 28-503mm is top of the line and aided very effectively by the dual image stablilizer that make the photos sharp and clear. Autofocus is excellent and it easy to capture action photo when you need to. The electronic viewfinder is good, there are enough options to covered all aspects of photography. This camera is simply one of the most comfortable camera to handled and the layout of the camera body is clear and logical. The battery life is excellent and for its size and four AA batteries, this camera is relatively lightweight. The video part of the camera works just fine but you will need a \"H\" xD card to make it work. This camera catered to the advance casual photographer.On the downside, the photo capture speed is pretty slow. I think it has to do with the inferior xD card. Even when you are using their \"H\" (high speed) card, the capture speed is slow. Using their usual \"M\" card is simply too slow. I have to use the \"burst\" mode to capture series of fast shots since it take too long otherwise to snap one after another. As the ISO rating goes up, so does the noise level. Up to 400 ISO, its still pretty good but after that, it get pretty worst. Its still good as long as you don't blow up the photo that much. I think this camera is built for 4x6 to 8x10 crowd.This camera will probably be compared with the new Sony H9 camera that came out couple months after SP550UZ. While Sony H9 is a superior camera in all aspects technically speaking, I still like the Olympus better. I have five reasons for this. First I dislike Sony's tunnel vision electronic viewfinder. Being an old film SLR guy, I still enjoy shooting through the viewfinder. Sony's is terrible while Olympus is a joy. Second, unless you got small hands, H9 is not a very comfortable camera to hold compared to the Olympus' roomy feel. I think for most, Olympus will \"feel\" better then Sony. Third, with controls and interface laid out so illogically, H9 feel bit chaotic compared to the Olympus. Olympus is far easier camera to use then H9. (Of course, maybe I am not use to the Sony's format design.) Fourth, Olympus' 18x zoom lens is superior to Sony's 15x lens. Fifth, I think Olympus' flash is more intelligent then H9. Of course, all this is rather subjective but its food for thought.This camera come highly recommended but like in all things of this nature, many people will buy their camera due to their subjective likes and dislikes, brand loyalty and even looks.

At the other end of the ISO range it is terrible like pretty much all affordable digitals at high ISOs. I love it for photographing buildings and landscapes and for Macro photography of flowers and small intricate gizmos, jewelry, and anything tiny with lots of important detail.  It is just barely OK for portraits of adults who are cooperating, but here we are bordering on its real weakness.  It is slow to go off. It seems to need time to think before the shutter goes off and in that space of time an average four year old can change expressions turn around twice and leave and then reenter the frame.  This is not  snapshot camera for people who want to take pictures of undiciplined people and pets.  For that it is so useless, that I gave up and bought a Panasonic Lumix with very similar specs, a leica lens, and a 12X zoom.  It has a slowest ISO of 100 and as a result lacks  the amazingly noise free clarity of the Olympus at ISO 50, but the important difference is you can get the picture of the kid with that great expression still on his face.  The two of them are perfect for what I do with a camera, and both combined are still half the price of any digital SLR I'd be willing to own.  I woulld still buy this for shooting any of the things I said it was good for. It is capable of noticeably better pictures than the top Panasonic.

Flarity", "ReviewID": "R1WML3UY0N523R", "Overall": "3.0", "Content": "I agree with almost everything mentioned in other Amazon reviews except for the image quality. I recently did a side-by-side comparison of photos taken with the SP-550, SP-350 and a Nikon 35mm (with 35mm-105mm lens) cameras. Photos taken with the SP-550 seemed to be good until I compared them against images from the SP-350 and 35mm. They were noticeably less sharp and had less contrast than the other two cameras. I bought the SP-550 because I found the 3X zoom of the SP-350 to be too restrictive. I wasn't surprised at the reduced image quality because it's obvious the lens would have to have more elements and thus reduced image quality.If you can live with a 3X zoom, I highly recommend the SP-350. Image quality was similar to photos taken with my 35mm Nikon SLR. Though the 35mm had better dynamic range. Although the SP-350 is not made any more, used ones and old stock are still available.Also note that I like the Olympus Master program that comes with both cameras. The Olympus Master program has a provision to upgrade the firmware of your camera, which I recommend you do after you purchase it.

My girlfriend's mom lives in Maine and her backyard opens onto woodlands where she feeds a lot of the animals so her windows offer FANTASTIC wildlife photo ops.Two years ago I'd made the same trip with my FujiFilm S5000 which is a 10x optical zoom and 3mp.  The Fuji was never top of the line, but I've always been happy with it, but thought the SP-550's 18x optical zoom would blow me away!  I'm sorry to say it didn't.  I took the camera back after the trip.It IS a nice camera and if you don't already have a nice camera it's a good buy, but it really wasn't so much better than my Fuji that it was worth spending the $400.In comparison to the 3 year old Fuji it had a harder time with 'less-than-perfect' conditions.  Example:  two years ago I got some good shots of flying squirrels and raccoons with just the light from the front porch - this year with the SP-550 it was a struggle - I got similar photos, but only because I took so many some turned out ok.  Of course it's easier the less zoom you use - hard to hand-hold the camera steady enough for the long zoom to gather enough light.The Olympus was also slow to focus - and I'm sure that's to be expected of an 18x zoom - it's got more focusing to do so it can take longer.On the up side - it does take nice photos, good colour and sharp.  It is nice to have that extra zoom capability (although, I have to admit, I didn't just didn't find that I noticed it that much - maybe I was expecting too much).So all in all, yes, it's a nice camera and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an ultra zoom point and shoot - but not if you're already happy with your current camera.", "Date": "July 24, 2007"}, {"Title": "What I wanted", "Author": "K.

This camera takes excellent photos, even at 18x with good lighting, if you are faced with a low light situation at 18X, you should probably have this on a tripod, and give the camera time to focus,or better yet, use manual focus.  I will take a decent photo at 18X, but again you are at the upper limit of what it was designed to do.  My car is designed to run at 115 mph at times.  Would I do that all the time, no.

With that in mind, this camera did a great job of being an all around all purpose camera, and even did a good job on some long range shots.  I even got good shots of the London Symphony Orchestra at night, at Barbicon from about 700 feet back in upper level seats.The pictures can get a little noisy at 1600 ISO, but I have other cameras that will not even operate at 1600 ISO.My only complaints, and biggest concerns with this camera are the USB port, and battery life indicator.  You cannot use a standard USB cable with the camera. This must be a recent change for Olympus.  I have several other olys that use the Standard USB mini jack.  Now, you are forced to keep track of another cable.Secondly,the battery life in this camera is great, I was able to shoot well over 600 shots,even using image stabilation on one set of AAs.  However, the battery indicator is pretty much useless. Several times, I was shooting and the battery indicator showed full power, and after 2 or 3 more shots, the LCD flashed \"battery empty.\"  The indicator,does not give you time to plan your battery changes. In one case, the batteries during the LSO concert and it was too dark make a quick battery change.  I had to use a second camera.There are some complaints too about the XD card, but I knew about the XD card requirement before I bought the camera, so that was not an issue for me.Even, with the downsides, this camera takes great photos under the right conditions. Yes, I did get some bad shots too, but I don't blame the camera. Sometimes, I just missed the shot, or shot before the camera was ready.I own a high end Nikon camera too, but I still prefer the shots that come from my Olympus cameras for overall picture quality. I have a couple of friends that always say, the photos look 3D out of the Olympus cameras, especially out of my C-8080 Zoom and my C-60.I probably would buy the 570UZ if this was my only camera.  I bought the 550 because it was relatively inexpensive and I didn't think I would be heartbroken if it was lost or damaged while on vacation.  Now, that I have used it, it quickly becomming one my favorite cameras.Update - 09/22/2011  Still use this camera and pictures are still very good.  I have friends that have purchased some of the 12mp and 14 mp cameras and they can't believe that I still use this 7.1 MP camera and how nice the photos look.  I still like this one because it uses AA batteries and I can always get fresh batteries if I have to go and take photos on short notice.", "Date": "April 21, 2008"}, {"Title": "Great camera for beginner or intermediate photographer", "Author": "Barry L. Hobbs", "ReviewID": "R2T6VO807TVVT3", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I bought two of these cameras, one for me and one for my wife. The biggest selling point was the 18X optical zoom. I sold a Canon S2 IS (which I loved) to buy this one, so my expectations were pretty high. For the most part, this camera has not disappointed me, but there are a couple of things that I miss with the Canon. This camera will take bursts of 15 fps, but only in low resolution and shot-to-shot lag is pretty slow, even with a type H XD card. Many of the preset modes are pretty useless to me, but would help a novice. It does have a built in \"guide\" setting to walk an inexperienced shooter through a good exposure. The 18X zoom is great for us as we are avid bird and animal photographers. We'll put these cameras to the ultimate test on our upcoming trip to Panama this December! I'm pleased with the picture quality and wider range of resolution settings, too. This camera has a special \"time lapse\" shooting feature that my S2 didn't have and although I won't use it often, it's there when I want it. The metering seems to work a little better on this camera than on the Canon and I like the individual settings for contrast, sharpness, and saturation, as well. Focusing in low light is slow, but I had the same problem with the Canon, too. The wide range of ISO settings is a plus as well, because if I am in a situation where I can't use the flash in low light, I can still get the shot, albeit grainy. So, after about a month of shooting and experimenting with local shots, I am very happy with this camera.

I am a huge fan of camera's that take AA batteries (like this one does)... I always carry multiple sets of rechargeable batteries with me at all times, but it is nice to know that if they failed, a quick stop at a local convenience store and I am back taking pictures again.

I did a direct comparison of both cameras, taking identical shots.  The Olympus produced soft images that bordered on blurry, with colors more muted than the Sony.  The Sony has a 3\" LCD screen, which is much nicer than the Olympus 2.5\" screen.  I thought there would be a big difference between the wide angle and zoom of the two cameras, but the poor picture quality wasn't worth the extra wide angle and zoom (which weren't that different from the Sony after all).  Finally, Olympus cameras have a strange flash function- you must manually raise the flash if the flash is needed- it doesn't happen automatically as it does in most other large zoom cameras.

I have used a number of SLR models over the years, including models from Edixa (my first camera), Konica, and Nikon. It compares favorably in build quality to the Konica SLR I have from many years ago, but does not match the build of the Nikon cameras I have used over the last 20 years. I wanted an unobtrusive digital camera to take on trips into mountainous areas I enjoy hiking. This camera is quite compact and light (if anything, a bit too small for my rather large hands). The picture quality exceeded the expectations I had from the reviews I had seen on the product. There is noticeable barrel distortion at 28-30mm (35mm equivalent focal length), but image quality is otherwise excellent at the 50 ISO Sensitivity setting. The camera does build noise quickly as the ISO Sensitivity goes up, noticeable on significant cropped enlargements at 100 ISO, and degrading noticeably at 200 ISO on photos viewed at full screen. I am surprised by the effectiveness of the image stabilization feature. I am not a particularly steady handed person, yet I can hand hold the full telephoto length even on a cloudy bright day at shutter speeds of 1/250 of a second or faster. The auto focus has worked flawlessly for me, and the exposures are quite good in the program modes. I am a bit disappointed in the ability to manually control exposure. Maybe it is because I used the controls on manual and limited auto cameras for so many years, I like the controls on the outside, not buried in a menu which requires so much more time to adjust.The real overwhelming advantage of this camera, is the ability to get very long telephoto shots on a camera that is so compact. A lens that would zoom out to 500mm focal length on a SLR film camera, would be very impractical to take hiking in the mountains of Wyoming. This camera will grab shots you just could not get otherwise, and the saturation and image quality is still remarkable out at the full zoom extension, and all without lugging around massive amounts of equipment.

The ability to zoom so far on the fly without changing lenses has allowed me to capture many great things.  The macro is amazing, and once again there is no need to change the lens.  Flower shots come out with stunning color.  I use the panorama mode to lock the exposure for my panoramas but stitch the photos in another program as I have found the Olympus Master 2 program often shows seams if your overlap is greater than the software allows for.

It's batteries need a recharge after 35 images, max, although I don't use the large viewer and turn off the anti-shake. Then I have to charge them 2 or 3 times to get them to work. I was using Sony and Energizer 2500Mah with poor results, so The company accepted it back as flawed. The replacement is the same. I then ordered the Olympus charger and batteries recommended for this camera, and they are no better.  What's funny is, my daughters Canon Supershot (same Mpix, anti-shake, large videos) worked fine on my \"spent\" batteries.A lot of \"noise\" is evident in images taken in low light. The high ISO which is supposed to help in low light, actually makes it worse.All my Olympus cameras are well made and easy to use, though the internal battery died in one after 3 years, so I have to redo my settings every time I change the battery.
