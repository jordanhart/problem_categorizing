{"Reviews": [{"Title": "A very good mirrorless DSLR like compact camera", "Author": "cutie19", "ReviewID": "R2NECRWSJ52PB7", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I have tested my new Samsung NX2000 for 2 weeks and its overall performance and picture quality is not bad, actually very good. I was shopping a DSLR like mirrorless compact camera that provide light weight, changeable lens and good picture quality camera. I have two choices either Sony NEX5T (just released this month) or the Samsung NX2000. Believe me, you won't find too much reviews and details info on the website because both cameras are new. Some info and spec I found on line actually was incorrect and the reviewers did not really done a hand on review. Most of them were just review the camera spec sheet and criticize its good and bad. I concluded Sony NEX5T is a better mirror less camera than NX2000 but its price tag still consider steep when adding up the optional lens, accessory flashlight. It will cost more than a grand. If budget is also a factor of consideration, the NX2000 can fit in perfectly. The NX bundle lens kit cost less than $800.So far the operation and picture quality of the NX2000 are pretty good. Its APS-C sensor definitely can react to more lights. The high ISO performance is very good below 6400 without noise. It is still tolerable if higher than 6400. The noise reduction from this camera is very good. The contrast AF is not bad, believe me it is not fast but really not bad. The 8fps continue shoot was surprising fast and perfect for motion sport. 20-50mm kit lens without image stabilization performs pretty well and the 50-200mm zoom lens with OIS is excellent.Pro:Price fits budget buyer who wants good quality picture and changeable lens compact camera.Easy and clear in camera menu and touch screen with less button (I consider less button is a pro but  some user don't)Fast 8fps continue shooting with high accuracy to catch the perfect moment.Big APS-C sensor gives better quality pictures. Combines with the high ISO low noise reduction, this camera can shoot without flash.Many optional Samsung lens to choose ( I prefer buying the 16mm wide angle lens too)Con:Contrast AF not Phase detection (the speed is still acceptable to me)No optional EVF, it is very difficult to see the screen under sun light. Samsung, how can we take a good photo under the sun light when the LCD screen is totally invisible by the reflection. I think Samsung needs to consider an option EVF that can be attached to the hot shoe like Sony did on the NEX.Battery life is also unacceptable. I highly suggest purchase 2 or 4 for back up and you need a aftermarket wall charger.Update Oct 1 2013: After continue usage of this camera, I found out the LCD screen under the bright sun light is really a problem. Although I can adjust the LCD brighter to make it easier to see, it will drain the battery faster. Samsung really needs to make an optional EVF to attach it on the hotshoe as soon as possible. I don't mind to spend couple hundreds to buy an optional EVF for this camera but seems Samsung is not listening to the feedback of the consumers. No tilting LCD panel + no optional EVF made the outdoor bright light shooting not too much fun.Update Dec 4 2014: When I keep using this camera everyday on street, indoor, outdoor sport and car show, this camera continues give me the good quality result. I have no idea why some people gave one or two stars on the review. Some said the price on Amazon is more expensive than Costco then gave one star to the product. It seems it is not fair to this product. Some complained the auto focus is slow, I know this camera doesn't have a super fast AF focus with phase detection, but the speed is not too bad at all. The point & shot cameras are no way to compare. Remember this camera is not P&S;, it is a DSLR like mirrorless camera. If you don't know how to use the M,A,S,P mode and its setting, you either don't buy this camera or go to take a photography lesson. Because I am sure if you can't take good pictures with this camera, it is either your skill or haven't learned the full function of this camera.", "Date": "September 23, 2013"}, {"Title": "Nice compact system camera", "Author": "Gadgetman", "ReviewID": "R32Y5DXJ6LUN0K", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Samsung NX2000 compact system camera comes with many nice features in a reasonable price package . I have been using this camera for a couple of weeks with quite a bit of photo shooting on my trip to Hawaii.What I like about this product- Compact and light weight. This is one of the key factors for my purchasing decision as I wanted a camera with interchangeable lens and yet easy to carry around on trips and vacation. The camera weighs about 1 lb with the body and the 20 - 50 mm lens.  I was able to store this camera together with a 50 - 200 mm zoom lens in the Case Logic DCB-304 Compact System/Hybrid Camera Case (Black). It was a tight fit but it worked pretty well for carrying it around.- large 3.7 touch WVGA screen for controls. It is quite easy to navigate the various shooting modes, controls, and viewing photos / videos.- nice picture quality supporting upto 25600 ISO.- a variety of controls for the more advanced photographers. Some of the features I like included the  focusing / exposure / metering  modes, bracketing by exposure / white balance, manual adjustment of the flash's power, and ability to create  our own custom settings. The camera also comes with a neat feature called \"beauty face\" which automatically smoothen the skin tones either in real time or applied after the picture is taken- wireless Wi-Fi capability. This is a function which I like very much. It works flawlessly for sharing the pictures with the Samsung Smart camera apps, e-mailing photos, and uploading photos to face book. An existing Wi-Fi connection is needed  for the files sharing and transfer. The Samsung smart App also has a remote view-finder function which allows us to remotely control the camera using our smart phones.What could be better with this product- lack of EVF which makes it a challenge to view under bright sunlight.- the focusing system on the 20 -50 mm lens is pretty slow and is a bit difficult sometimes to achieve proper focus particularly in low light situations. The 20 - 50 mm lens does not have the OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) function neither which makes it a challenge for shooting fast moving objects. The Samsung 50-200mm Telephoto zoom lens for NX Series Cameras which I also purchased does come with OIS. You may also want to consider the Samsung EX-S1855CSB/US NX NX Ifunction Lens for Camera (Black) as an upgrade as it provides much better focusing mechanism with the OIS function. I have also provided some detailed information of this lens in the product page.Overall, I am quite pleased with this camera given its price with  nice picture quality,  compact design with interchangeable lens , and the wireless sharing capability. It is a step above the  point and shoot type camera for those would want more advanced controls for their photo-shooting.", "Date": "October 25, 2013"}, {"Title": "Samsung NX2000 20.3MP", "Author": "Paul Rohrbach", "ReviewID": "R25W9VVORY5M1X", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "I started with a Minolta SLR back in the early 70's, graduated to a Nikon SLR and a complete dark room.  Did a lot of neat stuff \"push-processing\" film to increase the speed, then to color.  Last 8 - 10 years a lot of digital gear, printing software and that was huge in terms of flexibility.The Samsung NX2000 has exceeded my expectations, which is loaded with features you might expect to pay a much higher price for a much larger and heavier body.  Some basic software (included in this purchase) and I was off and running.  Very user friendly.  20 to 30 minutes with the manual and I was uploading to my iPad, Facebook and into files for storage.  15 year old grandson was able to do same with this camera.Can not say enough about how user friendly this camera is.", "Date": "January 3, 2014"}, {"Title": "Nice touchscreen UI, poor image quality and focusing", "Author": "Alberto Vargas", "ReviewID": "R24P5S3I3IMNWJ", "Overall": "2.0", "Content": "I have been evaluating this camera for more than a week and comparing it against a Nikon 1 J3 plus my other older cameras. I have been a Canon guy over the years, and I currently have a P&S;, a G series, and a DSLR from Canon, all of which are getting old so I was looking to get a large-sensor mirrorless camera.In many ways this camera points towards the future of non-phone cameras: it has a large sensor (bigger than a phone is ever likely to have), wifi connectivity for immediate upload and sharing, and large touch screen with smartphone like gestures (zoom, swipe, etc).GOOD:The best thing about this camera is the UI. With a couple of screen touches, you can change just about any setting. There is an awesome touch-focus-snap feature that allows you to focus where your finger is on the live image, and immediately take a shot. After using the touchscreen, any other camera without it looks primitive. The touch screen is great for taking photos as well as reviewing the results later.Wifi connectivity is also nice. It allows you to upload to Facebook, Picasa, Youtube, and Microsoft SkyDrive. I used the latter since it is like Dropbox - a good place to back up files for post-processing later on my PC. Wifi worked well.Lastly, because the sensor is APS-C size (like on most DSLRs), you get a nice shallow depth of field (bokeh blurry background) which is hard-to-impossible to obtain with smaller sensors.BAD:Image quality is closer to point-and-shoot than SLR. This shocked to me, given the large sensor. I attribute it to the image processor rather than sensor or lens. The images have a slightly pastel-blur quality to them (when viewed zoomed in) that I have last seen on an old Sony point-and-shoot I had 5 years ago. Looks like an image processing and compression artifact to me. Also, the level of noise at high ISO looks identical to that of the Nikon 1, whose sensor is 3x smaller.Auto white balance is also a bit off, at least on mine. It tends to produce slighly cooler tones, especially compared to the Nikon 1. Under indoor lights, when manually set to tungsten, the color matches the Nikon's auto white balance, but it is clear which company makes cameras and which one makes cell phones.Auto focus is slow and sometimes impossible under low light. This is very frustrating when trying to photograph kids - the moment will be gone by the time you are ready. Interestingly, if you use the touch-focus feature on the screen, the camera is much more likely to focus correctly, when the shutter button focus fails to focus. I guess there is difference between the shutter button focus trying to evaluate a larger area, while the touch-focus tries to find contrast in a smaller area and succeeds. Even so, focus is not as fast as I'd like (and slower than an SLR or the Nikon 1). BTW, focus is also likely to be lost during shooting video, especially at low light and longer zoom (50mm on the kit lens) and then there is a second or so of trying to lock on again, which is a bit annoying.Image stabilization is lacking. Most cameras in this class have it either in the body (sensor) or lens. Not here. The kit 20-50mm lens is not stabilized. This makes a difference in low light situations and when shooting video.Lastly, the physical buttons and controls on the camera suck. It would have been nice to have a normal PASM selector on top like most DSLRs have. Instead, there is a semi-useless selector on top (I avoid using it since it is hard to guess what it will do in what mode).OVERALL:Not recommended. Image and video quality are more important than UI and Wifi. The Nikon 1 has shown me that phase detect autofocus and image stabilization are necessary in a camera of this type. Samsung NX300 has phase detection, and if its autofocus is faster and better, I may give it a try. Another option is the Sony NEX series, which also has image stabilization and supposedly better image quality from the same size sensor (I have not yet tried it).", "Date": "December 21, 2013"}, {"Title": "great cam", "Author": "Amazon Customer", "ReviewID": "R3EB5L3SZZ6MZD", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "Takes amazing pictures and is really easy to upload pics with wifi.

It does take good pictures once you get focus -- but that happens long after you want the shot.  I purchased as a bundle from costco and so price wise, its so inexpensive.  But honestly you are better off paying for a real dslr, or using a bridge camera.  The slow autofocus is not something you want, ever, if you want to take pictures of wildlife or children.  If you only want to take pictures of landscapes and sightseeing, then this is indeed a very good option, and I would recommend that you track down the Samsung NX 16mm f/2.4 Camera Lens (Black) to use with it.  I did pick that up at the same time.  You do have lots of creative options for a fraction of the price.  The lenses are good, and all seems solidly built, but no person in their right mind would want the slow autofocus.TO summarize, I ding only the autofocus -- all else is great. -- but snail slow autofocus that seems slower than 10 yr old point and shoots does not a DSLR replacement make.  It was impossible to get pictures of kids swinging at a pi\u00f1ata at a birthday party.  Almost 15 yr old canon 20D(wielded by 9 yr old nephew) handled the task with ease.  A T4i is fantastic with the kit lens and far better focus.I was looking at this for my son as an inexpensive dslr option to figure out all the features and the menu is easy to use to set things manually etc.  But hunting for focus for several whole seconds -- ( I once timed 4 seconds in indoor lighting with the full 200mm zoom)  is awful.  Its slightly faster with the 20-50mm lens indoors.  Honestly, can't say enough good things about the sony p&s; zoom -- and they have a new version that must be even better.Will also confess I am a long time DSLR  user -- currently use a canon 5DIII and 70D...** 12/23/2013 ** added a star.  took this and the sony hx300 on vacation to costa rica.  ended up liking this better than the sony despite the sony having quadruple the reach and a movable view screen.", "Date": "December 4, 2013"}, {"Title": "not a simple camera", "Author": "Dai N.
