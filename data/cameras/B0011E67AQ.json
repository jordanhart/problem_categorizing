I bought my Sony to make video reviews and to take a multitude of pictures. The camera comes with a very user friendly \"how to\" manual for those of us who aren't too tech savvy. For the price, it is a steal. The picture quality is excellent and rivals the quality from a lot of more expensive cameras. The Sony software isn't interchangeable with other brands so be ready to pay a little more to equip your product with Sony only products. All in all, an excellent purchase!", "Date": "July 2, 2008"}, {"Title": "Awesome camera", "Author": "Rosaidh Ceallach", "ReviewID": "R2VNS7VTKDVP7R", "Overall": "5.0", "Content": "This was a birthday gift for my teenager.

It is crucial that the camera I am using produce high quality photos that I can have printed in 8 x 10 and 10 x 13 sizes.

I have used it to take photos which have been turned into greeting cards, into poster size prints, and used on web sites.  The quality is that good!The Sony Cybershot is very user friendly, has a great zoom feature, and is worth every penny.

So far it's proven easy to use and good quality. The screen is large and vivid. The five-point auto focus works well, and gives you great clarity in your pictures. The flash is a bit slow, but otherwise it's a fast shot. The only downside is that you have to use the sony memory card and adapter in order to get pics onto your computer or printed at the store. Otherwise, it's a great buy!

Our 3 year old will not sit still for pictures and this camera is so fast, we actually get several great shots! Also, I notice a difference with the 8.1 MP in the clarity of many of our photos.
