{"Reviews": [{"Title": "Impressive features!", "Author": "Bruce B. Webb \"bfishing\"", "ReviewID": "R3BT3QB75WZVI3", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "The Cisco WVC2300 video camera has some pretty impressive features. I wanted a network security camera so I could learn more about the technology in video surveillance. So having options like interchangeable lenses, I/O ports that can facilitate alarm system triggers, turn lights on and off from the camera web interface, two way voice, controls for mounting on a Pelco pan/tilt base to control movement remotely, and PC-less event recording directly to Network Attached Storage via integrated Samba client makes this camera a winner for my needs. It should be noted that this is a business class device that is designed with the pro-consumer and IT professional in mind. It's primary goal was not to be super easy to use and operate. If you're looking for a good super easy setup and basic feature(s) wireless camera with great reviews the Sharx Security VIPcella SCNC2606 Wifi Wireless 802.11g Security Network Camera is a excellent choice for cameras in this price point. Looking to spend a little less? Give a look at the under $100 Foscam FI8918W Wireless camera. If your're a box camera fan you maybe want to check out the ATC\u00ae WiFi 2-way audio Box IP Camera H.264 software 720P webcam security CCTV NC531MW H series, which has clear, crisp and extremely good detail picture quality or the new Toshiba IK-WB30A IP/Network Camera with 2 Megapixel 1600x1200 Resolution looks very impressive on paper for everything except the digital zoom :-(The Cisco WVC2300 video camera Wifi g wireless IP camera has its own built in web server. So it does not need a pc to work.  Authentication process requires a user name and password set by the camera's administrator. Here is a quick undocumented tip and or trick, if you need or have the desire to allow everyone to view the camera you can remove the user information from the demo account. You can view the video from your own home network or you can configure your router to view and control the camera from computers or cellphones on the internet, without dependence on any third party web sites or subscriptions. I also must give credit to the NETGEAR WNR3500L RangeMax Wireless-N300 Gigabit Router with USB as it was easy to setup the camera to be connected from the internet.It performs better than average for a wireless camera in it's price range likely because of the MIMO technology. I have not seen any other wireless security camera offer this feature. Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MIMO) technology is a wireless technology that uses multiple transmitters and receivers to transfer more data at the same time. MIMO technology leverages multipath behavior by using multiple, \"smart\" transmitters and receivers with an added \"spatial\" dimension to dramatically increase performance and range. MIMO allows multiple antennas to send and receive multiple spatial streams at the same time. This allows antennas to transmit and receive simultaneously. I've not had connection drops or slower video on this system and it's more than 75ft away from the wireless router on a different floor. If you decide to go with a network cable install it also supports POE Power over ethernet which is very cool. From my understanding the POE function does not work while the camera is in wireless mode. I love the freedom of wireless personally and you can put the camera almost anywhere. It does not have to be permanently in one location because of cables.It is very well built and feels pretty heavy and solid. It is longer than I thought around 8 inches long and 3 to 4 inches wide. In order to protect the camera from electrical surge(s) and or unexpected lost of power I put the unit on a small ups. I can't tell you how many devices fail or die to soon because they are not properly protected (Best Buy had a CyberPower - 425VA SL-Series Battery Backup System for 29.99). Also if you unplug the camera or experience a power outage the camera may get confused and go back to ethernet mode and not wireless. This may cause some to believe the camera no longer works. To fix this issue if it happens simply reconnect to a wired connection and set it back to DHCP if you previously had a static address and power off then on without the cable to force back to wireless. You may have to find the new address on the router or wireless access point for the new wireless connection. Another reviewer stated some good practical advice (for any computer hardware) regarding downloading the newest update(s)\"Firmware Version: 1.1.2.6\" was the latest release for download when I purchased this camera. Also downloaded the monitoring console software and other items too like the video surveillance software that allows you to setup a recording schedule and storing the video on a pc.  I was surprised that it already had a microphone built-in, but the speakers needed to be purchased separately, and they need to be powered speakers. Two way audio works, but a good deal of background noise (fairly soft), but very noticeable was experienced as well. I had a better experience using the half-duplex and not full-duplex option setting for the 2-way audio, so you can't talk and listen at the same time, but it cuts the amount of noise and interference. It is easy enough to toggle between talking and listening. In general you get basic picture size options going up to 640*480 and the typical Brightness, Sharpness, Contrast, control settings to adjust the picture. This is an adjustable cs mount 6 mm lens. You can adjust the focus camera by slowly rotating clockwise or counterclockwise the very tip of the barrel of the lens base that is closest to you. I had to manually focus the camera to adjust for a clear and sharper image. After the focus was corrected it's got good picture quality. For a optional lens, you can use any c/cs mount and Cisco offers some custom ones for $$$ I would not recommend the Computar Wide Angle 2.3mm (which was not as sharp or clear as the stock lens) unless you need a really wide viewing area like a parking lot, but I've really enjoyed the Fujinon-3-11MM varifocal lens which allows both wide and  narrower field of view(s).The DC-iris control connection from this len's is a four-pin standard plug that fits directly into the camera's iris output. The len's delivered impressive optical quality due to the high standards for resolution, contrast reproduction, and coating. The night feature works in extremely lower light, but not in total darkness. You can purchase IR units to resolve this i.e. Pinecom PN850 48 IR LED Illuminator. Another feature is to turn off the LED operations this can help the camera be hidden in a dark room. Motion Sensor was not as important to me, as it will be on 24x7. In this price range most software packages that come with the wireless security camera have a pretty basic limited motion sensor features. You may want to give a look at the Triple Sensor Technology (Body Heat Sensor, Motion Sensor, and Sound Sensor)on the Panasonic BL-C230A Wireless Internet Security Camera if motion detection is a primary concern. I did complete a simple configuration of motion detection and set it to email me when motion occurred. Both video and still jpeg attachment options worked fine. The picture looks great on the ipod touch and the new iphone 4, but audio controls are only available on the MS Internet Explorer browser. Also the camera has a shallow tripod hole and it can be a issue with standard tripod mount screws, so the unit may not be a tight fit on pan / tilt units. Overall value of this unit comes from its ability to be useful in many different environments because of wide range of possible options.If they improve the following this would be a 5 star wireless camera.A camera in this price range should have a memory slot for data storage.Many cameras in this day and age also have HD. The picture quality is good on this camera, but HD would be a welcome improvement. Yes, I know the Cisco IPC-2500W model has p720 HD, and the non wireless Cisco Video Surveillance 4000 Series IP Cameras also features 1080 Full HD, but they cost $1k or more.Include a Pelco pan/tilt motorized unit (Most likely would move this camera out of the price range)AS20RS485 Indoor/Outdoor Pan/Tilt Camera Scanner appears to be compatible for around $140... If you just need a indoor pan/tilt option that can be set in a loop cycle then just get X-10 Ninja Pan & Tilt Camera Mount Kit - Model VK74A for around $40. If you want to be able to control a indoor pan/tilt unit over the internet using the WVC2300 cameras web interface (like me) the 3030WQ with Transformation decoder board about $40 - $50 plus shipping worked out pretty good.Include a interchangeable camera lens i.e.3-11MM varifocal lensEnable the audio controls in other browsers not just MS Internet Explorer. A noise filter would also be a welcomed improvement.When you bring up the console homepage the default volume is set too high! (Maybe a setting I over looked, but if not they really should fix in the next update).802.11n wireless network capable and go ahead and add a 3rd AntennaEnable POE option when the camera is operating in wireless mode (Like other Cisco products i.e. Wireless Access points)IR Night Vision i.e. RAYMAX 25 suitable for all low light installations up to 20 metres (66ft)or maybe the POE option Raymax 25 IP. If you need something a little more affordable maybe look at the Pinecom PN850 48 IR LED Illuminator (I like it)[...]", "Date": "August 21, 2010"}, {"Title": "Does just what I need", "Author": "R.

Also, you should download upgraded firmware 1.01.Getting it to work wireless would have been a cinch if they documented how to do it!  Comes only with a quick start guide that never mentions wireless operation.  Found the full manual on Cisco/Linksys site and got the wireless up and running fine.High quality 640x480 streaming video over the Internet.  I am especially impressed by how well it handles night vision -- I am watching my ill mother now sleeping with almost no light at all on in her room and I can see her better than if I were 3 ft away.  Sound quality (snoring at the moment) is fine.I am quite impressed and grateful for the tech assist in caring for my mom.", "Date": "December 8, 2009"}, {"Title": "No rebate", "Author": "M.
