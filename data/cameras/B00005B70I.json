If you're looking for very good pictures, good battery life/charger, decent price, ease of use, and don't need all the bells and whistles, this is the camera for you.  The resolution of the pictures rivals the $1000 cameras from 3-4 years ago, and most $400-$500 cameras today.  The docking station is a must for the super fast battery charger 2.5 hours and quick upload of pictures.  You can't really compare this to any camera on the market, since cameras are either expensive and have loads of options or cheap and an inferior picture/battery.  Over the next couple of years, all cameras will be copying what Kodak did here with the docking station/charger.  I haven't even needed to purchase a Flash Memory Card yet, since the internal memory on this camera holds 16 FINE resolution pics (48 good res pics, I believe).  The fixed lens on this camera produced breathtaking pics; the zoom was not impressive, but I didn't really buy the camera to utilize the zoom that much.

This bundle is so great because it INCLUDES the Kodak DX 3500 digital camera *and* the Kodak Camera Dock. As someone who has used cameras that do not come with a simple snap-in bundled dock, I've been frustrated, but this makes it soooo easy to upload images to your computer for sharing and/or printing. The dock is also great because it recharges the battery in a snap, instead of fumblign with awkward chargers and losing batterie around the house. (\"Honey, where's the battery charging now?\")The camera itself has a 2.2-megapixel sensor that allows you to ceate generous prints up to 8\" x 10\". Most people tend to stick to the 4\" x 6\" prints, but it is nice to have the option.The 3x digital zoom lens with autofocus and 8 MB internal memory is enough for most pictures, but this could have been a bit larger. In some instances you might find yourself hurrying back to the computer to transfer the images so you can take more pics. Depending on the format size of the image, you'll be able to take about 40 photos (more than a 36 exposure roll of tradtional film - yeah!) before needing to transfer images to your computer.

It would be interesting to know if the other owners have the Camera Dock. Yes, it's [expensive] but what a breeze to use. Pop the camera into the docking station and push the button and your pictures are loaded into your computer. Also, if you are using rechargeable cells the docking station will keep them fully charged. A full charge from dead flat in 2.5 hours. The camera itself is a delight to use. I never used one before and had mine up and running with the supplied software loaded and the first three test pictures (of my cat) on the monitor screen in about 1/2 hour. This little camera does more then my 35mm SLR and I see instant results. If I do not like the picture for what ever reason (camera angle, subject movement, etc.) I can delete the shot and retake it. In about 3 minutes I have written a letter with a picture attached and sent to my children and grandchildren living 300 miles away. They share our lives as we live it, not as an afterthought three weeks later when the film is developed, we pick out the pictures we want to send, and then \"snail-mail\" the pictures to them.

It is definitely much easier to use than many other camers.  However, this particular camera does have a tendancy to take pitures which are dark and frequently need to be adjusted after-the-fact using the software package.  Also, the automatic flash rarely makes the right decision (flashes when it shouldn't, does not use a fill flash when it should).  It takes some experimentation to learn how to manually set the flash for different indoor lighting conditions.  Picture quality was fine, once any darkness was adjusted.  The digital zoom creates blurry pictures every time.  If zooming is an important feature for you, this is not your camera.

However, this is completely offset by a fixed-focus lens and no optical zoom (it has a digital zoom, but these are not nearly as useful). The rest of the features are acceptable, including memory & expandability, flash, battery useage & USB connectivity.

From the plastic casing to the super light weight of the camera was the first thing. Just the controls and the feel of the camera make you think of a toy! Not having an optical zoom is another setback. When you use the digital zoom through the LCD the image gets almost unrecognizable. It pales in comparison to the Olympus D-460 as far as features, construction (the 460 is rock solid!) and LCD quality. The only thing it has better is the megapixels and that is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. You really get what you pay for here.

The first thing that threw me off was the fact that it comes with a lithium battery pack (this is the version without the docking station). I spent a while trying to figure out how to charge the batteries before I realized I didn't need to. Most of the time, it's easiest to use it like a regular camera -- point and shoot. If you use the digital zoom or the cloeup setting, though, you're better off using the viewing screen to line up a shot. Another unexpected feature was the way it interfaces to a PC. I expected the device driver to use twain protocol. Instead, the camera, when plugged into the USB port, acts like an extra disk drive. The internal memory and memory card show up separate folders, each of which contain JPEG images, one for each picture taken. I can load, edit, save and delete the images using my favorite software. Couldn't be easier.I've seen a number of reviews saying that the images are blurry. The only way I could manage to take blurry pictures was to turn off the flash and take a picture in low light, but that's true of any camera.Using the digital zoom feature tended to result in pictures that were a bit grainy. That was pretty much what I expected, though.

I am really happy with this purchase. It came in two days and we were up and running right away. Only thing I haven't figured out is how to get the dock to download directly to my D drive instead of C. Otherwise, you have to move the pix if you don't have room on your C drive. We have an older computer so we don't have much room left on the C drive. We chose this model over the 3600 because we didn't need the optical zoom (tried it in the store and the pix didn't seem as good as being 9\" from the item with the 3500) or the movie feature.

I am able to get good quality pictures from the lower pixels and can e-mail or print them quite clearly.  I am impressed that I can take approximately 50 pictures with the internal memory set at the lower pixel and can take at least 16 pictures with the higher pixels.  The only problem I have thus far is the quality of the pictures taken when using the zoom feature of this camera.  The pictures are out of focus and fuzzy.

I'm a novice user, and getting started with the camera is a piece of cake.  I was taking pictures before the presents were all unwrapped.  I also reveived the dock that's used to download pictures into my computer. This is a must have. It is unbelievably simple. Literally put the camera on the dock, and press one button, and the system does the rest. The Kodak software opens, and the pictures are displayed right in front of you. Picture quality is outstanding. I think 2.2 megapixels is plenty. I've printed out 8x10s, and they come out sharp.Here's an unforseen serendipity: It feels great having the freedom to snap away, and just delete the pictures I don't want instantly. The feeling of losing that tense, \"make every picture count\" feeling you get with a regular camera is beautifully liberating.  Which leads me to another must have: an external memory card to insert into the camera. This will increase the amount of pictures you can take from about 20 with just the camera alone to about 50 for the smallest memory card.  They're fairly inexpensive and well worth it.  Downside: The camera has a digital zoom, but no optical zoom. In other words the lens doesn't physically extend when I want to zoom. I press a button, and it will zoom digitally. But in order to see how close you're getting using the digital zoom, you must look at the LCD screen, and not the viewfinder, which requires pulling the camera away from you face.

I personally do web design, and needed something that would give me nice pictures without breaking my pocket, after several months of research i broke down and bought a refurbished Kodak DX 3500.I will say I am immensely impressed, the camera is easy to use, takes wonderful pictures even on the lowest settings and allows me to take 40 pictures with just the internal memory. The digital zoom, tho everyone seems to complain works wonderful for up-close pictures, I mean like right ontop of the subject/object it definately removes the haziness you would normally get, but using it at distances cause it to blur which is normal for any digital zoom.The tranfer to my Mac is absolutely simplistic, it took awhile for me to get all of the automatic stuff like the transfer utility and the web browser popping up on start up to go away. I don't recommend using the tranfer utility on a mac it always locked mine up, i have a 233mhz 128 meg first series iMac with OS 8.6. Instead i just let it mount the camera icon to my desktop then drag the pictures from the camera folder to where i want them and it transfers quickly and smoothly.The camera itself feels a bit flimsy, but i wouldn't worry much, i'm hard on equipment and its managed to take the beating i've given it, even been dropped a couple times.Another plus to this camera is that it takes GREAT night pictures, and works wonderfully if you are trying to get that artsy effect, i definately like being able to turn off the flash.Now for my downsides, this is definately NOT a professional camera, don't expect it to be, you can't manually adjust the zoom, you can't manually do anything. Also the menus can be confusing until you figure them out or read the manual, it took me about 2 days to get it all down. Also the memory in the camera isn't much if you plan on a long trip, i advise a compact flash card, i've order a Viking one since they seem recommended for kodak for mine.And the last downside is that the pictures on the LCD can be deceiving as to what they will look like. I advise only using the LCD, as you would for almost any type of camera with an LCD, just to make sure you got the area you wanted, don't trust color, brightness/darkness with it.All in all this is a good camera, if you want professional be prepared to spend more, but if you want something to take good pictures, this is your camera, its easy, functional, a good design and takes wonderful pictures.

The DX3500 is an extremely capable camera that is easy to use for beginners and sophisticated users alike.Compared to the HP 318, the DX3500 offers superior picture quality. Fine details are not lost in the 'grain' of the image. Colors are well balanced and smooth. Setup and operation are easy with the single function knob and easy to navigate menus displayed on the rear LCD.One feature that should be mandatory on digital cameras is a lens cap or cover. This model has a lens shutter that turns off the camera when closed. In addition, there are guide lines on the viewfinder that show you where the edges of your picture will be so you don't cut off what you're trying to photograph.Battery life is okay with alkalines although they aren't recommended for use with this camera because of the high drain. Kodak includes a Lithium Ion battery pack with this camera that provides a lot of use out of the box. Another plus is that this camera only requires two AA batteries as opposed to other units that require four.The included software installed smoothly on Windows XP and when the camera is attached via the USB port, it shows up as a removable drive under the file manager. You can transfer files with either file manager or the Kodak software. Using the Kodak method is easier and allows you to automatically clear the camera when the pictures are downloaded.I purchased two NiMH batteries and a charger for less than twenty dollars instead of buying the Kodak camera dock and rechargeable batteries. The dock simplifies image transfer and would be useful if you're doing a lot of picture-taking. It can also charge Kodak batteries when your camera is docked.At medium resolution, the camera's internal memory stores 48 images.

I purchased the easy dock and have not been able to transfer pictures even once using the easy dock.  I have transferred pictures connecting the camera directly to the computer, however, the transfer software only seems to work 50% of the time.

First of all, even with 2.2 MP resolution the pics don't look that much great than if taken with a webcam. Second and most important thing THIS CAMERA EATS BATTERIES ALIVE!!! How can someone design a product that consumes that much energy?, if you use a fully recharged or new pair of batteries with the macro option (for close ups) they won't last any longer than 15 mins. I've seen myself waste 4 or 5 pairs of batteries in a photograpgh session, I've tried rechargeable, metal hydride, nickel cadmiun, alkaline, everything, nothing works well, with the exception of buying another expesive thing, a camera dock, so you can recharge batteries (there goes the \"cheap price\"). It is unbeliavable that such an enegry devouring product doesn't have the option to plug it to an AC adapter. Third, lighting... want to take some pics indoors or at night? Well you can't, they'll be so dark not even trying to fix them will work, the flash isn't powerful enough, not to mention even in the auto setting it is always on (meaning there's never enough lighting).My advice, spend 50 more (the cost of the camera dock) and buy something else.", "Date": "July 18, 2003"}, {"Title": "First-time Digital Camera User", "Author": null, "ReviewID": "R1I02TMLE829LF", "Overall": "4.0", "Content": "My husband received this camera free at a conference.
